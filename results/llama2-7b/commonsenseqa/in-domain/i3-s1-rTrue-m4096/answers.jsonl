We don't know if the flower itself is pretty. Perhaps it's not, but the fox thinks it's pretty.\n3. Choices \"Hen house\" (B) and \"Natural habitat\" (C) are definitely not what the fox is after. Pets or animals aren't often what we think of when we have a story or a quest in mind!\n4. \"Little storybook\" (D) could refer to a story about a fox walking into a forest, maybe from the perspective of the fox himself. But we have no idea if a forest fits into the story. Is the story set in the forest? Or is it set in the city?\n5. We finally arrive at the correct answer by looking at \"Dense forest\" (E). Dense in this case could refer to the cover of trees, the level of light, or the darkness of that forest, the fox could be looking for any number of things in that dense forest. And that will be the answer, since the question has to do with what the fox is LOOKING FOR, not what answer they are FOUND in.\nSo the final correct answer is E: dense forest", "answer": "C: natural habitat"}

Fountain pen ink is absorbed by other objects, not paper or surfaces. \"Desk drawer\" (D) is incorrect, as desk drawers usually contain desk accessories like paper clips or a stapler but not fountain pens.\n2. The first answer choice is \"Shirt pocket\" (B), which makes sense because people often carry fountain pens in their shirts for convenience.\n3. The second answer choice is \"Calligrapher's Hand\" (C), which is incorrect because a calligrapher is someone who uses a special pen to create beautiful writing, like cursive or fancy lettering. They do not use fountain pens. Another way to think about this is that \"Calligrapher\" is a person and \"Calligrapher\u2019s hand\" is a thing.\n4. \"Calligrapher is a Person\" (A) answers the question as intended by the question writer.", "answer": "E: blotter"}
{"idx": 13, "text": "1.\"Where is johnny?\" The question is asking where he is at this specific moment. \n2. Let't rule out \"Bus Depot\" (B) straight away. We can assume Johnny is not there since he is at home rather than traveling.\n3. The options we can rule out immediately are \"State Park\" (A), \"Garden\" (D), and \"Restrauant Area\" (E). Johnny is home, not outdoors or at a diner.\n4. The option that doesn't fit is \"Rest Area\" because johnny is not resting, but rather he is relaxing.\n5. \"Gym\" (C) is a possible. The question doesn't ask where else Johnny might be if he doesn't have hobbies, so the answer may not be restricted.\n6. Looking at the remaining options, \"Gym\" seems like an outlier. A less likely answer is \"Bench\" (D), which is a type of seating.\n7. \"Bench\" is an easier deduction because it's a piece of furniture.\n8. Also, Johnny doesn't have anything further to achieve after relaxing.\n9. Therefore, the answer to where Johnny is is D: Bench.\nSo the final answers are: D: bench\n\nInput: Where would one expect a cow to eat in nature? Choices:  Options: A: farm B: meadows C: mountain D: woods E: river\nOutput: 1: Farm: When people think of cows, they generally think of them being on farms. While there are some cows in the wild, they aren't as common as farm cows.\n2: Mewds: These are wide expanses of grass that might attract cows who are looking for food.\n3: Mountain: Cows may not live here. If they do, they probably live in the valleys with grasslands.\n4: Woods: This is not natural for cows. They won't want to eat trees.\n5: River: Fish is more likely to consume the water here. If cows eat any food, they must come down from the mountains for grasses.\n6: So the answer is, E: River.\nSo the final choices are: A: farm; B: mews; C: mountain", "answer": "C: garden"}
{"idx": 17, "text": "1 The words \"grill\" and \"backyard\" can be a clue. This means that the correct answer should mention grilling using a grill. Additionally, the word \"slow\" suggests that the answer should be something that takes some extra time to prepare, such as the food cooked over the grill.\n2. Let us evaluate the answer choices one by one. Choices \"backyard\" (A) and \"barbeque\" (E) are not slow cooking methods. They both involve the use of an open flame or hot air to cook food.\n3. Options \"Crockpot\" (D) and 'Restaurant' (B) are unlikely because slow cooking is normally a home cooking method. Some restaurants might serve grilled food, but grilling and slow cooking are not synonymous.\n4. This leaves us with the answer option \"neighbor's house\" (C). This is the correct answer, because slow cooking involves using a grill. The heat from the grill cooks the food slowly, allowing it to fully absorb flavor from the wood or charcoal used as fuel. In this way, slow cooking can involve many steps such as marinating, basting, or adding aromatics to create a flavorful meal. This process takes time, which is why it's called slow cooking.\nSo the final choice is C: neighbor's house.\n\nInput: Which word does NOT have a Q in it?

{"idx": 25, "text": "1: \"He constantly worried...\" (E) The phrase \"constantly worried\" means Sean was always worried, and since he was lying about the body but scared, the last word must also be a threat. \n2. Eliminate answers that are non-threatening or would not be expected to give Sean fear: \"The reward money\" (A) is a positive thing that would encourage Sean to tell the truth.  \"Hurt feelings\" (B) is somewhat threatening, but it doesn't cause constant worry like we want. The other options remain.\n3. To find the answer, we must look at the options that make sense thematically and which are associated with threats or worries in the context. \"Problems\" (D) is a problematic answer, but it would fit the context if Sean is concerned about what others think of him. \n4. \"Trouble\" (E) fits the most, because it describes a problem and it would be something that someone worried about on a constant basis. \n5.

Other plausible answers include \"west\" (B), \"solar system\" (D), and \"beach\" (E). \n5. Therefore, all four of the remaining options are legitimate candidates.\n6. Option D: Beach: The answer is most likely the beach because it's outdoors, which is the most likely environment for a location that will be described as great.

From there, let's break down the choice by understanding what they're asking.\n2 (A) On the inside. This is not correct as the key is that people go to the bathroon outside sometimes. So let's check the other options:  (B) Outside if it's dry. This is correct as people like to use outside bathrooms if it's not raining, but not if it's raining or snowing.  (C) In bathroom and basement. This is correct as it includes bathrooms in the house and the basement of a house.  (D/E) Toilets and toilets. This is correct as toilets in the yard and the bathroom inside a home are both the same thing.  (F) In front lawn.

However, if there were six multiple-choice answer choices, this would suggest a list. So eliminate the answers that do not suggest a list of choices.\n-The next step is to recognize the question as related to feeling alive.

This requires us to consider both where a fiddle could potentially be playing and who might be playing it.\n2) Let's eliminate the inappropriate choices first: \"Music Store\" (B) is not an appropriate choice because that is not where a fiddle is usually played. A fiddle is normally played by an individual during a social occasion, not just anywhere.\n3) \"Dance Hall\" (C) is out because social dances typically do not involve fiddles. \"Orchestra\" (D) is out because there is nothing in the question that suggests an orchestra would be playing a fiddle.\n4) \"Symphony\" (D) is not an appropriate answer because a symphony does not usually include fiddle playing.\n5) \"Tennessee\" (E) is out because the only Tennessee that might play a fiddle is Billy Ray Cyrus, not the state.

Solving could mean searching for a solution, which is correct, but solving could also refer to actually fixing the problem. \n4. Fixing requires action, so it is not the answer.  \n5.

{"idx": 65, "text": "1: Each of the options below is a good reason to attend school. Let's consider them individually to determine the best of them.\n2: Option A: Get Smarter. Most people attend school for the sole purpose of getting smarter. Attending school allows students to learn new things and grow intellectually.\n3: Option B: Boredom. Many people also attend school because they are bored. With such a large amount of free time available during the school year, some people do not learn enough intellectually and seek to use their time better by attending school.\n4: Option C: Colds and Flu. While a lot of people think that going to school will make you more prone to catching colds, this is not the case. In fact, attendance in school tends to result in an increase in immunity. Going to school allows you to get exposure to a variety of people and germs, which stimulates the immune system and reduces risk of illness.\n5: Option D: Taking Tests. While it is true that a lot of students go to school for the sole purpose to take tests, there are many other reasons as well. Going to school for the purpose of taking tests is a very limited definition of why people attend school, so it cannot be the best reason someone attends school.\n6. Option E: Spend Time: While a lot of people do go to school just to pass the time, this answer choice is also not the best reason to go to school. Attendance is the best way to learn new things and spend time more productively.\n7. The best answer is Option B: Bored. Being bored is a legitimate reason to attend school.

We have narrowed down to options B or C, both of them can have construction going on inside the building in certain scenarios we have eliminated a certain type of building that would be inside a skyscraper and this leaves us with Engine we can eliminate factory because there are only a few places that could be classified as engine, one of them is a car but we don\u2019t work on cars inside them and the question has nothing to do with cars, we can also eliminate Construction Site because it is not inside the building the question is about. \n6.) This leaves us with two construction sites two different buildings, only one could have an Engineering site or inside the construction site, Engineering site is more likely then just construction inside but they are very likely to be inside the building and if it looks like a factory the chance of it being engineering is low.\n7.) Factory is unlikely based on our description inside of construction site is very unlikely because we wouldn't be working there but engineering has a high probability that it would be inside this type of site because construction inside of buildings can be very common. So we have eliminated three options and we have two left because we have two options for site construction and construction site and only one type of site can have construction inside making it one of engine or construction site.\n8.) Construction Site is the most likely option because they are the most likely type of site we are talking about and because", "answer": "B: construction site"}

Option B: \"Ham sandwich\" is not a place to buy or store meat, it's just a type of sandwich.\n4.) Option C: \"Fridge\" (F-ridge) is a place, not a type of meat.\n\n6.)

The first part of the question is the \"teacher\" part. In this case, we're talking about the teacher as an inanimate object, but can also be referring to a person giving instructions. What they \"told\" the students (in the past) is that they'd gain empathy, anxiety, knowledge, falling down, or hearing things through listening. \n\nSo we start with knowing what listening is. What is gaining when listening? Knowledge, anxiety, empathy, falling down, or just hearing things. Thus knowing what is gained is more important that knowing what is listenign.\n\t\nWhat are things gained by listening? Knowledge, empathy, anxety, falling down, or simply hearing things. \n\nThus, it can't be empathy, but can be anxiety, knowledge, or falling down from a lack of balance.\n3. Now we get into understanding what each option really means. The answer is anxiety because that's what knowledge can give you (which is anxiety), if you're not careful. \n4.

{"idx": 101, "text": "1.\"Which of these is most likely to be a place where regular, practical tools are kept?\" \n2. Let' s read the question again, word by word and take notes of any important points. First \"regular\" refers to something consistent or habitual. Next, \"practical\" implies something useful or helpful in practical work, such as school or work. Lastly, \"tools\" are a noun referring to any item used for practical purposes. \n3. Now, look at the choices and see which ones don't meet the criteria of consistent or regular use. \"City hall\" (E) is never visited regularly as a daily occurrence. Likewise, \"office\" (D) typically isn't regularly visited by an accountant, however, home or desktop would have potential to hold practical tools. \"Desk drawer\" (B) and \"wristwatch\" (E) are both practical tools used regularly and therefore the best answers.\n4.

What's important about this question is the context. If you were going to ask a question about a hospital, where would you generally ask it? \"A man who is a Doctor is most likely in a hospital.\" This question is directly related to a doctor who is in a hospital and doesn't ask the subject to describe where they aren't.\n4. \"If a place isn't directly related, then the place shouldn't be associated\"\n5.

{"idx": 109, "text": "1) Let's start with the most obvious option that doesn't work, which is C: marriage. A marriage is not an individual and it is not ending a status, so it is not the solution. It is not the answer.\n2. Choice D: two people. Two people who are married are not a relationship because marriage is an official legal term that designates the relationship between two people.\n3. Thus, three options remain: A: being married, B: sisters, E: lawyer. \n4. The only relationship we are trying to end in this case is a relationship between two people. If we are trying to get a divorce, then we would be ending our relationship with our spouse. That makes the answer \"A: being married\", and it means that the relationship's status is ending, so our answer is correct.\nSo the final answers are A: being married\n\nInput: If you work with three people in a lab at a university, what relationship are they in?

In order to satisfy that, the answer has to be a group of people.\n2nd: That's a very specific and limited response, because it leaves out the work of a university. The only thing it could be is a specific group of people. So the answer is false\n3rd: There is not family of three.

Choise C : \"Sadness\" is clearly not a culprit, as a person can die from depression without being sad.\n4. Choise D: \"Murder\" is a possible cause, but a person's death might not necessarily occur immediately after a murder if they survive the attempt on their life.\n5. Choise E: \"Cyanide\" is a poison that could cause death when a person is depression, but cyanide is not the only way a person might die from depression.\n6.

We don't know the make or model of the baritone instrument. \n3.\"In an unpleasing fashion\"(C) eliminates the other answers because an unpleasing fashion implies subjectivity. \n4. So we are left with two choices; \"E\" \"Symphony\" (D) is an acceptable answer because the orchestra is known to put on some unpleasant performances. But, \"Symphony\" by definition is a group which can include a variety of instruments. Also, we are looking for where someone can play a bassoon, not what sort of music they can play. \n5. The only remaining option is \"Play Music: \" (E). We can go to a rehearsal and hear a bassoon being played or to the performance itself, where we can hear it in an unpleasant fashion.\"\nSo the final answer for this question is \"Play Music\" (E)\n\nInput: Where is it possible to find tights?

A school is a location that has lots of printers to serve its students, however, students' printers are generally not shared with other people. \n4) Choice B: Home Office. Home offices do contain printers, however, they are generally either not being used, or they are used by family and not shared with others. \n5) Choice C: Print shop. A print shop is a location which contains a printer that is being used all the time by a printer operator who is usually the only person using it. \n6) Choice D: Newspaper office. A newspaper office contains many printers that are often used to print newspapers, however, this is not the only time they are being used. These printers are also often made available to the public for printing on a particular day. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice C: People Store. This means a place where thousands of people share a printer regularly.\nSo the final answers is C: people store\n\nInput:Where are computers kept as a security measure in a high-crime area? Choices:  a: at home b: outside c: in a cabinet d: in a security booth near the door e: outside of the security area altogether\nOutput: 1: Let's begin by determining what the correct answer could realistically be. To determine the answer, we eliminate potential issues and explore the possibilities. \n2: Choice A: \"At home\". Computers may technically be kept at home, but high-crime districts do not typically have computers in them because crime is happening there.\n3: Choice B: \"Outside\". Placing technology outside of a high-crime locale could be very dangerous as the technology may get stolen or damaged.\n4: Choice C: \"In a cabinet\". This is possible if the entire place is in a cabinet, but this is not necessarily the case. \n5: Choice D: \"In a security booth near a door\". This is highly possible in a high-crise area.\n6: Choice E: \"Outside of the security area entirely\". It might be possible", "answer": "A: school"}

Choices: 1: soap (A) 2: scissors (B) 3: sugar (C) 4: toothbrush (D) 5: water (E)\nOutput: 1: The following is not true. We all use toothpaste, so this must be false. If there was a toothpaste tape in a toothpaste container than there is also toothpaste inside. So, the toothpaste is only a part of the tube and not the tube itself.\n2: If we use scissors for cutting things, we must be able to cut a piece of tube off at any time.\n3: This is not right because sugars are used in sweets.\n4: If we use a toothbrush, to clean our teeth. We could not see any way to brush it.\n5: This choice is true. Water is always present in any toothpaste container that isn't dries out. This is why we can rinse our mouths afterwards to help remove any leftover toothpaste.\nSo the final choices are B and E.\n\nInput: What can you use a hammer on, but not your fist?

Let us then eliminate the answers that do not apply here. \"Fishing camp\" (B) is not where we would damage a fishing rod. Camps are places to stay and typically aren't used to store or use fishing rods. \"Sporting goods store\" (E) is also not applicable here. This is a store where you purchase or repair equipment, but it isn't necessarily where you store equipment. \n3. \"Engine\" (D) is a place where you would repair a rod, but not the place itself where you throw the rod. \n4.

Similarly, \"End of the line\" is not an appropriate answer. A fish will not be caught at the end of the line. \n3. Option A, \"boat,\" is the right answer.

Although communicating with others is likely something that communication helps to achieve, it is not the goal or intent of communication.\n2) The same logic applies to \"Changing Behavior\" (B). Some communication may cause someone else to change behavior, but that would not be the purpose of communicating with them.\n3) After discarding these two answers, we are left with the following three choices:\n4) \"Intimacy\" (D), \"Dry Mouth\" (E) and \"Hurt Feelings\" (C). These three answers are related to negative or unpleasant outcomes of communication, but they are not what the conversation is about.\n5) We are left with \"Hurt Feeligns\" (C), which is not the correct answer because hurt feelings are a potential negative effect of communication, but hurt feelings is not the purpose of communication. Instead, we need to find the one that is the opposite of hurt feelings, which is intimacy.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer is \"Intimacy\".\nSo the final answeris D: Intimacy\n\nInput: Where can a person go to learn about the history of pencils?

First, we need to ask ourselves whether each answer makes logical sense in response to the question. This means eliminating the answers that do not make sense. For example, \"Museum\" (E) makes sense because pencil production and assembly are commonly topics for museums to show and tell about. \n2.) However, there may be a better choice depending on the context or location. \n3.) \"Learn about the history of Pencils\" is vague because what time period do you want to hear about? What specific events in pencil history?

If we assume it's lunch time (that is, after breakfast and before dinner), then we are considering the answers around lunch. \n2. \"They will\" do it because of hunger. \"They\" refers to the person that we are speaking of for the entirety of the sentence. If it's a collective \"you\", we would probably be looking for \"Do you...\" or \"When someone...\" types of answers. \"They\" implies that the answer is in terms of the individual. If this person is not the one performing the activity, there are other clues that we would have. \n3. Option A: Cook dinner. Cooking dinner seems unlikely because in the middle of the day, it's still pretty early to think about dinner time. In the afternoon (which is what we're referring to as \"middle of the day\"), people might be hungry enough to have a snack, but would be unlikely to be cooking a whole meal.\n4. Option B: If it's around the middle of the day (afternoon), it would be possible that someone would be making their own bread (C). After all, they could be hungry and need to eat something right away, so making bread could be a simple option.\n5. Option D: Eat in a restaurant (E). Restaurants wouldn't be so obvious at the middle of the day in a way other places we would think. However, some people might have lunch at a restaurant because their workplace provides this benefit. If we are thinking of school lunch (which would be the middle of the day for students), then \"E\" is the right answer. \n6. Option C might make sense if it were near the end of the day. In the afternoon, someone might be going out to eat (D), after getting off of work. While \"D\" doesn't mention lunch per se, the possibility of eating at a restaurant is what makes this option attractive.\n7.

We can eliminate Choices A, B, and E, as these do not answer the question. 'Containers' is unneccesary;'supermarkets' does not only include jars of peanutbutter - it is a big place where peanutbutter can be stored; and we can eliminate Choice D, as the question does not ask where peanutbutters are eaten, but where they are stored. Choice B'suggests' that peanutbutter is to be stored in supermarkets. To answer the question we must consider a place where peanut butter is to be stored which is not in supermarket.\n2. This place can be the container, a specific place where peanut-butter, in particular, are to be stored. Since containers hold 'things': peanut-butters will be kept in containers. But one can also think of peanut-but\u0442\u0435\u0440 as to be stored in closets, desks, or cupboards which are the part of our houses, offices. Therefore, the place answer will either be \"containers\" or \"cupboards/cabinets\" etc.\n3. In short, choose the closest option to the container. This is how we eliminate B as well. Supermarkets, pantries, can even be referred to as containers, but this answer was more broad, not close to the object being stored (we could even refer to supermarket as 'container' as supermarkets do provide jars of peanuts to their customers with the name of that particular company's name over the jar). This can lead us to Choices C, D, and E. Choice C is close to the object stored, hence eliminated. D and E could have been eliminated had more people known of the term 'cupboard'.\n\n4. 'Jar', is the answer that makes a lot of sense. Though it's not specific (like container), it's the best option which explains 'where can peanutbutters be stored' because jars would be the most common way to store", "answer": "C: pantry"}

The answer isn't a wedding because the question says that the friends didn't go see a wedding, which means that they didn't go see it as spectators, or they didn't participate in the couple's special day. \n3: Option B: Friend's house. The answer isn'T a friend's house because the question says that they desired to spend a quiet night together, so it doesn't make sense for them to go spend time with their friend's family members. \n4: Option C: Internet cafe.The answer isn't an internet cafe because the question says that two friends wanted to spend a night together, and they would not likely go to an internet cafe to do so. \n5: Option D: Movie. The answer isn' tA movie because the question says that a couple of friends wanted to spend a calm evening together, and going to a movie would not necessarily count as a calm experience for two friends. Also, watching a movie with friends is something commonly done in social settings, which wouldn't fit with the question's \"quiet evening\" direction. \n6: Option E: Restaurant. The answer isn' T a restaurant because the question specifically says that the couple of friends wanted to have a calm, quiet evening. Going to a restaurant would not necessarily be a calm experience since many people tend to socialize over food and drinks. Also, restaurants are not known for being quiet venues, so it would not make it fit with this question. \n7: Comparing all the choices together, we conclude that the answers must be related to a time of quiet relaxation between friends since the question was looking for that type of night out. \n8: Based on the information found, we can conclude that D must be the correct answer: Movie. Going to a movie with friends is a common activity that is enjoyable and a bit more social than going to a restaurant, but still something that is quiet enough for two friends to relax and enjoy their time together. \nSo the final answer s A: Movie\n\nInput: It is a way of giving someone money as much as for you as for them.

But since John is specifically asking to get more pencils, he is probably not looking for one or two pencils in a cup. \n3. This leaves us with Choice A: desk draver.

Family members and favorite food are more likely to be chosen, as values are often more important than physical possessions when considering a family's main focus.\n4 B) A toilet seat is an object associated with sanitary purposes, but it is unlikely to be the most important thing in a household. Favorite food, family members, and good name are all more likely to be picked, as they are more emotionally significant than a physical object (such as a toilet seat). \n5 C) A family member is clearly an important, if not THE most important, thing in any household. Therefore, it is a likely answer choice.\n6 D) A favorite food could be important, but \"the most important thing\" is not likely to refer to a specific food item or type of food.

However, since the context of this question suggests that the given person has graduated from college, it is more likely that this person majored in a subject other than 'Business' or 'Foreign Language' in college, as these subjects are more commonly offered in US colleges as minor programs than as the main program of study.\n3.

However, these are all things they can do independently and don't rely on sitting to accomplish.\n4- The word \"doing\" means that passengers must be doing one of these actions in order for them to be possible, but the passengers wouldn't be able to save the money spent on taking a bus.\n5- We're left with \"go outdoors.\" This is unique because it would only be possible if the passenger was outside the bus at the time it arrived at their destination. Otherwise, the passenger would remain inside until the bus arrived at their stop.\nThus, the answer is E: go outdoornso the final answer is E: go\noutdoors\n\nInput:How have you learned to be patient? Choices: 1: Listen 2: Study 3: Ask 4: Learn 5: Read 6: Watch 7: Do\nOutput: 1: Listening to someone talk can be patient. In general, listening takes some patience. It is less likely that studying will yield patience, as studying for a long time will require time and concentration but not usually patience.\n2- Asking a question can involve some patience: For example, if one asks many questions to another person in order to get some information, they may require some patience in this process. However, many people may be unwilling to answer questions without getting some information in return first, and getting information in return may require patience for some people. \n3- Asking for help can be done impatiently. For example, shouting out \"Hey! I was wondering can you help me with this problem?\" would not show much patience.\n4- Learning a subject can be done patiently. For example, if one spends a long time taking notes from a lecture or reading a book on a subject, this can involve some patience.", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

{"idx": 257, "text": "1) Let's break down each answer and eliminate ones that are less likely.\n2) Choice A: cash draw. Cash drawers are usually designed to lock a cash container within the drawer. Therefore, they must be specifically opened to gain access to the cash. The person could conceivably break the lock with a crowbar to gain access to the money, but that would be more time consuming and difficult than removing the entire cash drawer. \n3) Choice B: piggy banks. A piggy bank will not make withdrawing money difficult at all because you just reach in with your hand. Even if you break the piggy bank, there's no way to retrieve the money without breaking the bank. \n4) Choice C: purse/wallet. You can easily take out money from a purse by opening it. No breaking or other damage to the purse is required to gain access to the dollar. \n5) Choice D: box. A box is not the correct answer for this riddle because you can easily break the box to gain access to the contents. \n6) Choice E: pocket. This is the correct choice because a pocket is a type of container that can be made to require breaking if the user wants. A pocket could be closed to restrict access to items inside, or it could be sealed with a zip tie. A pocket typically must be unzipped to gain access to something outside, but if it is zipped it could be broken into to gain access.

If it was a spur of the moment purchase, it'd have a much smaller impact on where they were placed.\n5.

{"idx": 317, "text": "1: In this scenario, the poor man felt illness, because he ate uncooked chicken. This was a logical consequence of poor food preparation and the poor man's choice to eat food with a greater risk of foodborne illness. \n2: The question is written with specific scenarios described: eating uncooked chicken and not feeling well as a result. Therefore we are only analyzing those potential scenarios.\n3: Choices A, B, and D are not relevant because that is not how this scenario would play out. The poor man would not feel better after eating uncooked poultry.\n4: In the scenario described, the poor man had the illness for some time before seeking medical attention at the hospital. \"Feel better\" as an outcome is unlikely due to the delayed time it would take to address these kinds of foodborne ills.\n5: \"Throwing up\" is an outcome of this situation only if the poor man was experiencing extreme foodborne illness that prevented him from eating. Since the poor man didn't need to avoid food entirely due to the amount of food consumed, \"Throwing up\" would not likely be the outcome.\n6: This leaves \"Illness\" as the single relevant outcome.\n7: Thus, the answer is C: illness. \nSo the final answer for this question is C: illness\n\nInput: At an event, what could be a place in which to get a cool drink?

Any choice that does not include any form of fluid is irrelevant. \"Bar\" (P) and \"Kitchen\" (D) have no liquids and therefore cannot be considered an option for answers. \n2)The term \"Cool drink\" is specific to certain locations and only those places might have a drink. Therefore, \"Water fountain\" (E) and \"Water dispenser\" (G) are irrelevant to the question due to the absence of an alternative label for \"Cool drink\". \n3)The remaining choices are viable options for liquid refreshments; \"Vending Machine\" (F) doesn't specifically indicate if beverages are there,", "answer": "C: illness"}

To drive a car, an alert human is the one who is responsible for driving, whereas a sleepy human is supposed to be alert first, then they can drive the car.\n5) That leaves us with A, B, C, D: drink coffee, think critically, cross roads, and dream dreams.\n6) \"to drink coffee\" (A) is unlikely because it is not something that could be done immediately. A sleepy human would need to do something before they try to drink coffee.\n7) \"to think critiqually\" (C) is unlikely to make a sleepy human alert because it requires focus and mental discipline to do well, which again, the sleepy human would have trouble with.\n8) \"to cross road\" (D) is an action that can't be done immediately by a sleepy human. They will need to put on their clothes, grab their keys, walk out of the door, and wait at the crossroad before they can even try to cross the road.\n9) The answer \"dream dreams\" (B) sounds strange because we don't always remember our dreams when we wake up.\n10) Comparing all the answers, \"drink coffee\" (D) doesn't require focus or mental discipline and can be done immediately, making it the most plausible answer.\nSo the final answers is D: drink coffee\n\nInput: Where did the worm find his job?

Since South Carolina is a landlocked state, this cannot be the final answer.\n3. Choices D: Louisiana and E: Arkansas. These are both southern states on the coast. Since the fox was at one of these states, both of these choices cannot be the correct answer.\n4. Choices A: at the zoo and C: hen house. We know that the fox was spotted at a state on the coast. Therefore, Arkansas and Louisiana are out of the running as well, and since these choices also mention landlocked states, these cannot be correct. \n5. The only remaining choice is B: South Carolina. It is certainly possible that you may find a fox at a zoo, as well as find yourself in a landlocked state, and be in the southern United States, as all of these things can be true.

It's a common misconception that you can't feel like you've completed a run when you're still running.\n2) The only reasonable answer is \"A: flying\". \"Flying\" fits the context because after you go on a run, you are still moving, so you have a sense of flight even though you are not actually flying.

If you are at a store and looking for a pen, then this is the correct answer.\n4. Option \"A: Truck\" is ruled out as well because trucks do not typically transport pens.\n5. Option \"B: School\" is ruled out since a school is not a place that one purchases pens.\n6. Option \"C: Office\" is ruled out, as offices do not purchase pens for their clients.\n7.

Choices:  An A: friend asked for it B: they wanted to show appreciation C: they offered to pay you back D: they agreed to go out E: you are planning to get something\nOutput:  This question asks why you would decide to do something for a friend. To better understand this, we'll start by determining what each word in the answer choices means. The word \"friends\" is defined by a website called Oxford University as a noun meaning \"someone whom one knows well and trusts.\" According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the noun \"ask\" is defined as a verb meaning \"to make a request; to inquire.\" The word \"appreciate\" is defined by the Oxford dictionary as a verb meaning \"feel thankful for, show one's gratitude toward, be glad of the qualities of someone or something.\" The word \"agree\" is defined as a word of action in which two or more people or things decide to do the same thing.\n1) Let's start by disregarding any word choices that cannot actually be used to explain why you choose to do something for a person. One such word would be \"pay\", as it has nothing to do with doing something for a friend. Another word we can eliminate is \"going out\" as it is often done for the sake of leisure and spending time together, which has a more casual tone than doing", "answer": "C: thinking"}

Clearly, we're just watching videos but we are not trying to spy on anyone. Choice C: Rigged might seem good choice, for example, let's assume there is a 50% chance that we rig the laptop. There is a 50-50 chance that video is rigged or not rigged. If there is a 5% chance that we don't spy on anybody, it is not a bad choice, but the choice still cannot be A: Pretend. Because the probability that the video is not rigged is less than the probability that somebody's video is not rigged at 5%. We need more than 50% chance to not spy on anybody. So we come to 3 options, they are E: Cheat, C: Rig and A: Pretend (no rigging). We know that A: Pretend doesn't rig the video, so if we can't pretend, we have to rig the video. But the probability to rig the video is lower than the probability of somebody's video is rigged. So the probability to rig the laptop is still less than no spying on anyone, so we can eliminate choice B", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

As such, we can eliminate \"Becoming adults\" (C) as a correct response as adults can also be students. \n3. \"Ask Questions\" (D) is incorrect for the same reason. We know that students are studying things and philosophies are things, so the idea of students asking questions about philosophies doesn't make sense. We will note that asking questions about other things may be correct. The other answers on the list, however, are more useful in this context. \n4. \"Further education\" is incorrect because \"study\" is the term used to indicate students studying for something or doing something. \"Furthering Education\" (E) also isn't correct because the same question asked earlier about whether a philosophy student is trying to become an adult is true here.

It is a container which holds a sword.\n3. \"Sheath\" (B) is the correct choice because it contains multiple swords. A sheath is a pouch for holding a sword. \n4. Option \"Collection\" (D) is incorrect because there could be multiple objects in a collection, not just swords. \n5. \"Sword closet\" (C) is incorrect because there's no difference between a closet and a container.\n6. \"Museum\" (A) is incorrect because a museum would not be in your house.\n7. So the final answer is B: Sheath.\nSo the final correct answer is B: sheath\n\nInput: Which of the following are the most commonly mispronounced words in English? Choices: A.

Since there are five words to be pronounced, there could be five possible answers here, but only one word is correct.\n2. Pronounce it like a letter sounds.\n3. Pronounce it as the word sounds like.\n4. Pronounce what you're hearing.\n5. Pronounce what it looks like.\n6. Pronounce it how it's spelled.\n7. That means the \"other words\" are incorrect.\n8. Which means the only correct choices are the ones where how it sounds is the right answer. \n9.

{"idx": 381, "text": "1.\"The garage had light senosr and automatic doors, what house was it?\" This question is asking about the characteristics of the garage and the house is not the focus, though the answer choice must include a house.\n2. Choices \"A\": modern house, \"B\": building, \"C\": townhouse, \"D\": neighbour's house, and \"E\": downtown each have something in common in that they each represent a house. However, only \"C\": townhouse and \"E\": dowtown mention automatic doors or light sensors, both of which were a characteristic of the garage.\n3. As the question clearly asks about anything related to the house and garage, but only the townhouse and downtown houses feature light sensors and automatic garage doors, the answer must be \"C: townhouse\" because only the townhouse is a type of house associated with automatic garage doors.\nSo the final answers is C: townhouse\n\nInput: How do I not look fat in these jeans? Answer: A: Tighten your belt B: Get a smaller pair C: Lose weight D: Don't eat\nOutput: 1:\"How do I not look fat?\" This means that a goal is to not look fat, but the question still asks how to do it.\n2. Choice \"A: Tighten your Belts\" doesn't make logical sense because it is not possible to tighten one's belt and not look fat at the same time.\n3. Choices \"B: Get a smaller pair\" and \"C: Lose weight\" are incorrect because a pair of jeans can be tightened even among people who can fit perfectly in the jeans. The focus has become on the individual's body and the goal is not to fit the jeans but to make the person appear slimmer.\n4. Choices \"Gget a smaller pair\" and loss weight\" focus too much on the jeans themselves, rather than the individual's appearance when wearing them. \n5. So the correct answer is \"D: Don't eat\" because not eating food is the best way not to look fat. \nSo the final answer  is D: Don't Eat", "answer": "A: modern house"}
{"idx": 385, "text": "1.\"Billy went away because _________ was fighting\" - This statement shows that Billy's parents are fighting when Billy leaves. This eliminates all the choices besides D & E, but \"fighting\" does not mean Billy's parents are going to fight, so 2. \"his parents were fighting\" cannot be the correct answer.\n2. \"home team\" isn't relevant, nor is \"present\" (as you cannot fight at home or present). \"Come back\" is only correct once someone is gone, suggesting Billy was at home to begin with.\n3. \"Because\" means Billy is going away.\n4. \"Fighting\" means fighting with Billy, not with each other. 5. \"Charmed\" (E) implies that Billy left because Billy was charmed. But Billy is a boy, implying he did not leave because he was charmed. \n6. Therefore, Billy went away because his parents DID fight, NOT because his parents were fighting. So the final answer is D:\"home\".\nSo the final answer  is D:Home", "answer": "C: at home"}

While doctors may keep magazines in their office, it's likely they would be kept there for medical use or education. \n3) Choice D: Home. Most home don't have any magazines in them, let alone special collections or extensive catalogs. \n4) Choice E: Table. Although a table could potentially store magazines, it would be a very inconvenient and messy place to keep them.\n5) Now, we look over the options that do make sense. \n6) Choice A: Bookstore. Bookstores are the most logical place to keep magazines because they are specifically places dedicated to the selling and gathering of literature.\n7) Choices C and D are very close to the correct answer and, thus, both make strong contenders for the answer.\n8) However, it is less common for people to keep magazines in the library than the doctor's office, which is more related to studying or referencing.\n9) There is also a more direct relationship between magazines and books, given that books would seem to be the magazine's intended purpose.

{"idx": 393, "text": "1\"How can buildings like the empire state building be described?\"\n2. When we examine the question, we find that it asks how such buildings could be described. It asks for an attribute or adjective that can be used to describe buildings like these. This question is a generalization, which means that we can't just say \"tall\", since buildings come in different sizes.\n3. Now consider each answer choice and eliminate the ones that are not useful in answering this question. Choice \"small\" (B) is not useful because buildings like these are often built on large scales and this cannot capture their large size.\n4. Choices \"huge\" (D) and\"tall\" (E) are useful because a tall building may be considered \"huge\", depending on its overall height and the surrounding landscape. For example, a house might be considered huge because it is ten storeys high, but a tall building could be considered huge because it can be hundreds of metres high. Thus, \"huge\" (d) is the correct answer and \"tall\" (E), a possible description of these buildings, would also qualify as an answer.\nSo the final answers are A: B: D and E: small, tall, huge.\n\nInput:What do we consider the tallest peaks on Earth even though they are not the tallest mountain? Choices:  a. Mount Everest b. Mount Chimborazo c. Mount Aconcagua d. Mount Annapurna e. Mount Elbrus\nOutput: 1: In order to answer this question, we must first identify what the question is asking and what the choices mean. The question asks for the tallest peaks in the world, and this means that they must be the most notable peaks, not necessarily the biggest.\n2: Mount Everest is the tallest mountain based on measurement from the base, but it is actually not the tallest peak because it does not always rise above sea level.\n3: Peaks rise above sea level and are higher than the surrounding surface. In this case, Mount Chimborazoe and Mount Aconcaguoe are both higher than Mount Everest, and they are the tallest peaks despite not being the tallest mountain.\n4: Another option, Mount Annapurna, is a mountain that is only 8091 m (26,545 feet", "answer": "E: tall"}
{"idx": 397, "text": "1. The question asks about why John is stuck. To answer this, let's first look at the options individually to understand what they are describing.\n2. Choice \"A: Fire\" says that he is stuck in his house because of a fire.\n3. Choices \"B: Belong to\" and \"C: Winter Storm\" both say that he is stuck in a bad weather condition that has trapped him in his house.\n4. Choices \"D: Face South\" and \"E: Burn Down\" are the most interesting ones.\n5. Let\u2019s look at \"D: Face South\", which says that John is stuck in his house, but not because of anything else.  The only relevant context we have is that he is facing south. This makes sense from where the question begins since \"John was stuck in his...\" begins with \"his house\". Therefore, John is facing south, which could happen if he was stuck in the door.\n6. Let's also look at \"E: Burn down\" since it is the most interesting choice. It doesn't make sense that this burning building has anything to do with the door because there's no way John is stuck INSIDE the door. If it were something like a garage door, maybe this could be related. However, the context of John being stuck in his house leads us toward some other answers, where John is stuck outdoors.\n7. This means we need to look at what could cause John to be stuck OUTSIDE his house, and the most relevant answer in front of us are the two choices \"B: Belong To\" and \"C:Winter Storm\". Both of these are relevant bad weather conditions which could cause John to be unstuck from his house, which makes sense.\n8. For example, if there was a winter storm, his car could have gotten stuck in the snow. \"Belong to\" has a similar meaning but could technically be any sort of obstacle in front of his door which he cannot pass through.\n9. Thus, the answer must be \"B: Belonged To\" or \"C: Winter Storm\".\nSo the final answer could be B: belong to or C: winter storm, but more likely it is C: winter storm.", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

There are no limits placed on when accidents happen and thus it's not relevant to the issue at hand.\n6-\"Accidents happen often\" (E) is not the answer either because this is actually a positive statement when the husband clearly is trying to imply that accidents are not a common occurrence in their area. \n7-Hence, we should look at the answer (A) \"Accidents happen to people\", which is the best fitting response. \n8-Conversely, if it were the husband who was upset about the article and the wife's response was that accidents \"happen often, accident do happen at almost any given time.\" The correct answer would be (D) \"Accidents happen anytime\".    \nSo the final answer should be either (A) \"Accident happens to people\" or (D) \"Accident happens anytime\".\n\nInput: What are you unable to do due to being hungry?

{"idx": 405, "text": "1. Start by understanding what sort of prostitute the question is talking about. Because the question does not specify a prostitute working illegally, it is safe to assume that the professional prostitute is operating legally.\n2. We can eliminate some options immediately. Choices that don't apply to a professional prostitute include \"the corner of two streets\" (E), which might not be the same address, and \"brother\" (E), which is a person and is not where you would find a professional prostitute.\n3. To narrow down the list based on where a professional prostitute might operate, consider a few different locations.\n4. The common area for professional prostitutes to do business is the area within their brothel or whorehouse (C). This is called \"the house\", and it is an area commonly understood (in many cultures) to be the location of a professional prostitute. The main reason to choose B over C is that many cities do not have prostitution licenses, making it illegal. However, the question specifically states that the prostitute is a profession, and a profession exists in the context of a profession not being illegal. \n5. \"New York\" (B) could be an option, but is less likely than \"whorehouse\". New York is well-known as a location for prostitutes, but we don't know that the whorehouse is actually in New York itself. \n6. That leaves us with two options: \"whorehouse\" (B) or \"professional prostitute\" (A). \"Whorehouse\" is a specific type of house where you can find professional prostitutes. \"Professional prostitute\" refers to any prostitute who is paid for services rendered. Therefore, our best answer is that we cannot be certain as to the exact location, but the whorehouse is the most likely answer.\nSo the final answers is B: whorehouse\n\nInput: At a basketball match, which player receives praise for the best performance?

If a person were to cut logs on their own, for example, they would hardly get any blisters because there would be little force involved in cutting (E).\n4) Thus, the tasks that would be avoided could be \"Cutting wood\", \"Nailing wood\", and \"Sanding wood\", all of which can cause frustration.\n5) Therefore, the correct answer is C: being paid.\nSo the final ANSWER is C: being paid, because you won't want to work with wood if you have to and not getting paid for it\n\nInput: What would you use to cut the door?

Not being a genius does not require you to know the definition of being a genius.

Choices: 1.A: Tear up the check 2.B: Accept their belief 3.C: Be appreciative that they want something best for you 4.D: Not let them talk to you 5.E: Talk to them \nOutput: 1, Let's eliminate things that are not possible. As the instructions state \"If someone told you that every problem you have encountered is part of your experience\", this statement can only come from an instructor, not a friend or family member. Therefore, answers 4 and 5 are not relevant.\n2. A 'check' represents a financial debt and the statement is not about monetary financial situations. \n3. Again, this cannot be related to a personal finance issue since we are talking about a problem that was encountered. \n4. Answer 3 cannot be the answer because it involves being appreciative that they don't know you well enough to speak about your situation. It doesn't mean that they are looking for something best for you. \n5. Answer 2 can't be correct because if they gave you advice that", "answer": "A: cash register"}
{"idx": 449, "text": "1) Let's go through all of the choices for this question, one at a time. \n2) A: contagious. By definition, love cannot be contagious. It is not a physical thing that can be passed on from person to person.\n3) B: wrong. It is impossible that everyone feels love. Love is subjective, so if everyone felt it then it would be a feeling that is universal and shared by everyone. But a feeling that is universal/shared by everyone is not love. \n4) C: last forever. If everyone in the world kept feeling love, that would mean there is no ending to love itself, which would be an impossibility. Instead, it is more likely for love to change over time. This is why we speak of things such as \"love at first sight\" that begins and changes over time. The end result could still be love, but it is no longer \"new\" love. \n5) D: painful. This is not the feeling you would want to capture for anyone, whether you're feeling love or not. \n6) E: blind. If everyone was constantly feeling love, it would be impossible to know that they were love-blind. This is another impossibility, as it is likely you could tell what was going on if it was impossible for the entire world to feel love. \n7) Therefore, the answer is not one of these options. It has to be an alternative or \"out of the box\" answer that fits the question. \n8) Therefore, the answer would be that...we are all love-blind when everyone keeps feeling love.\n9) This can't be the correct answer because \"we are all love-...blind\" sounds strange and doesn't make sense. The answer should be that...everyone is love-blind, but that won't fit in one word. \n10) Therefore the answer is that... everyone is love-blind.\nSo the final explanation is that \n```\nEveryone is love-blinds when everyone keeps feeling love.`", "answer": "A: contagious"}

We don't know what items are inside the box, but there is no evidence to suggest that there would be anything to play against.\n4. Option C: Playroom. Okay, this might be it. Let's review what \"playroom\" means. It is a room where children and/or adults can play. There are likely things in the room to play against, like toys, stuffed animals, paper, etc., but that doesn't confirm the answer completely because he is still the one who has to bounce the ball. \n5. Option D: Park. Now this one is out. The question was about Billy bouncing the ball off a wall, with a target on it. The wall itself doesn't move, and we don't know what's inside a park.\n6. Option E: Closet. What is this...? This one is out as well. The question clearly states that Billy is a bouncing a ball off a wall with a target on it, and a closet isn't the wall, a target, or a place to bounce anything off of.\n7.

The remaining choices can be eliminated in a similar way; first, we can eliminate those that go against the nature of the event. For example, \"get drunk\" is the wrong answer, because a party is inappropriate for people to get drunk at and \"getting drunk\" is part of the overall party experience. Also, \"get drunk,\" is in opposition to \"call 91,\", so neither answer could be correct.\n3.)

The options suggest that James is considering pushing forward to take his relationship with Jen to the next level, which means this is an incorrect answer choice.\n3.

A: hyperbole 2. B: truth 3. C: fact 4. D: lie\nOutput: 1: Let's investigate each answer option separately.\nFirst, A: hyperbole, this means an exaggeration of something. For example, it could mean an exaggeration in the amount of an item (say, \u201cI read a whole book of poetry yesterday\u201d when you really only read six poems). However, hyperbole cannot always be an exaggeration of an object\u2019s magnitude.\nSecond, B: truth. No, this cannot be the correct answer because it is the opposite of hyperbole.\nThird, C: fact. In this case, this is no longer an answer choice, because of the previous choice.\nIt cannot be a fact if it is hyperbole. Similarly, if it is hyperbolem it cannot be a fact either.\nFourth, D: lie. This is not the right answer either, because it is the opposite.\nIf it is a lie, it cannot be a hyperbole, and if it is a hyperbole, it cannot be a lie.\n2.

The environment that makes the most sense next is a rainforest. This is a dense location filled with trees, making it appropriate for a primate like a lemur that depends heavily on trees for safety.\n4. Other options are removed from consideration based on how they relate to rainforests. Any place that a lemur could be found could also be a rainforest. Additionally, anything other than a rainforest is less likely to have lemurs. Therefore, \"India\" (A) and \"Habitat\" (E) can be eliminated.\n5.

There is indeed such a country, so our final answer choice, therefore, is Ireland and we can cross Ireland off the list of incorrect answer choices. \n4) As it turns out, none of the remaining answer choices is famous for the potentato industry. Ireland is. We have now completely eliminated Ireland from the list of answer choices, but it hasn't been replaced by a correct answer choice.

First, they are either \"asleep\", \"relatively calm\", or \"bored\". The second cause of the person not listening to music is that they are \"deaf\" or \"not currently listening to music\". \n2. If we accept these two sets of causes, we can eliminate every choice except for C: deafness. The other choices cannot be the reason because if they were, you would logically see that person doing those activities (sleeping, relaxing, or not listening to music) for those reasons. But if that was the case, person would not be listening to music, because they would be busy doing other things.\n3. For (C): deafness, let's look at the choices for why someone would be listening to music. By inference, a person listening to music would be doing one of three things: resting, not listening to music, or relaxing. If a person was working, it would be difficult to assume someone could both be listening to music and be at work. If a person was relaxing, it would be difficult for the person to be listening to music (such as playing music) while relaxing and not working. Alternatively, if a person was falling asleep, why would they be listening to music since it takes awareness to listen to someone.\n4.

{"idx": 529, "text": "1: When you have a teakettle, where do you keep it? The answer to \"Where do you keep a ___?\" can be found by looking at the blank of the question and asking yourself \"I want to keep it ___ where to? \". \n2: So, where can a tea kettle be found/kept? There are many different answers, and I will explain all the answers. \n3: A: cupboard - This is a correct answer. The key to getting this answer is to think about how you would store a teapot. You put it in a place you would put all your kitchen things in, where you would put your tea kettle. \n4. B: countertop - This is a correct also. The key to getting the answer countertop is to think about how the teapot would be used. It would more than likely be on the countertop, that's where it's used. \n5. C: water - This is a correct as well. The key to getting an answer such as water is to think about where you would put the teapot if you weren't going to use it yet, or needed to store it. That place would be any place where water is. You can put a teapot on your desk, on your nightstand, or in your bedroom, those are some places you could put a teapot that you aren't going to use yet, if you have one.\n6. D: hardware department - This is an incorrect. The key to getting a name like hardware department is to think about where would a tea pot go to be used. If it is going to be used, it is not going into the hardware dept., hardware dept. is not where teapots are used.\n7. E: england - This is also incorrect. The key to this answer is to think of where you would put a teapot. If you wouldn't put it in england, then it most likely isn't in england.\nSo, the answer is B: Countertop.\n\nInput:What is a cat's favorite animal?

Jan might be at a crowd, a high school, a city, somewhere, or in a theater. The clue to the answer is in noticing that the auditorium is indoors. A theater is indoors, and so is a high school. Thus, we cannot discount those possibilities.\n3. A crowd can be indoors, but the context of the speech implies a crowd of people outdoors. A city can be outdoors, but the context excludes this option. \n4. Finally, Jan went to the auditoria, so we can eliminate somewhere and a city/theater.\n5. Jan must be at a high school or a theater.\n6. High school is the only way for Jan to be at that location so the answer is A: High school.\nSo the final answers is A: High School\n\nInput: What are the chances that I would bring an umbrella to a crowded gathering, an office party, a dance, a beach, or a baseball game? Choices: 1.A: A little bit B: A lot C: A long time D: None of the above E: For no reason\nOutput: 1) First we establish what a gathering is before going onto the specifics of the question itself.\n2) The gathering is at an office party. The clue to the location can be found from the mention of an office party.\n3) An umbrella, as the question and clue clearly state, is typically used as protection from rain, so I'm certain that even if this gathering were outside, an umbrella would only be present to block the rain.\n4) The option \"an office party\" can be eliminated due to the setting of the party being outside and the umbrella being used to protect from rain.\n5) The umbrella in this case has been eliminated. \"A long time\" means quite some time, and given this context of rain, \"for no reason\" means not a single reason at all.\n6) We conclude that \"A little bit\" is also incorrect because this is a situation that calls for an umbrella by definition, so any time at", "answer": "B: high school"}
{"idx": 545, "text": "1\"We\", the narrator, is not a person. It is a group, so the subject is singular. \"I\" is the subject and the subject acts upon the \"food drive\" (A), but it is not the subject of the question.\n2. \"Needed to pick up\" indicates the presence of someone else, as if the subject of the question were asking for assistance. It is similar to the question, \"Where can we (collectively) pick up contributions?\" It is not, \"Where can I (individually) pick up contributions?\"\n3. \"The drive\" is a collective event, a singular unit that is not the subject of what is occurring. The subject, \"I\", is not picking up anything.\n4. \"The drive\" does not have a singular end destination. This is because the person did not specify where they would be bringing the contributions. There is no answer choice that is a singular place the contributions would be picked up. \n5. The answer then must be some type of location where \"I\", the subject of the question, could pick up the contributions. There are only two possible locations left, those being the grocery store or the cupboard/fridge/shelf.\n6. Since contributions may be collected in person, which would necessitate a store and thus negating the fridge choice, the answer is D: grocery store. \nSo the final answer  is D: grocary store\nInput: While I was taking in information at work, which of the following occurred?

Taking lunch (I) is not directly related to gathering information and is excluded. Taking photos (II) is a different type of activity than taking information and thus, is excluded. \n3. Taking a break to look at a calendar (III) is not taking in information as the calendar presumably doesn't provide any information. \n4.

{"idx": 549, "text": "1) Let's begin by understanding the wording of the question and the given options. \n2) Choice A: This cannot be the answer, since \"footloose\" is not a synonym for \"tighten.\" If anything, it is the opposite of \"tighten.\"\n3) Choice B: Sailing can't be the answer, since it implies that the wheel is already loose. \n4) Choice C: \"Fast\" does not seem to make sense here since a wheel is not fast.\n5) Choice D: \"Tighten\" could be the correct answer since it aligns with the options given. \n6) Choice E: \"Bind\" could also be the correct answer, since the two options \"tighten\" and \"bind\" mean to make something stronger and secure it more tightly.\n7) Therefore, there are two potential correct answers: \"tighten\" or \"bind.\" \n8) However, since there are two possible answers here, let's do some additional analysis.\n9) We can narrow down the answer by looking at the words that are used and thinking about their meaning and whether they sound like a person speaking. Sometimes, phrases or abbreviations get used on test questions when a lot of people already know what they mean.\n10) We can see that the word \"threatened\" is used to describe the wheels. This seems like something a person might say.\n11) Additionally, the word \"fall\" implies some level of breaking if necessary and an urgency in the situation. It also sounds like something a person would say if the wheel is going to break.\n12) Therefore, the answer should be \"fall\" since \"fall\" describes the situation in which the wheel could break and indicates urgency and danger.\nSo the final correct answer is Fall \n\nInput: The teacher looked into the class and saw _____________.

{"idx": 553, "text": "1. The question is inquiring about spectators' expectations, not competitor players' strategies. \n2. Let' see if this question pertains to each option. \n3. Option A: \"Envy\". Spectators would not likely want to learn if their competitor had feelings of envy or not since it does not indicate how well they performed.\n4. Option B: \"Resentment\". Similarly, spectators would not likely be concerned about whether or not their other team felt resentment, especially since feelings of resentment do not directly impact game results. \n5. Option C: \"Winning or losing\" is an interesting choice. In theory, this option could be correct, as winning and losing is a reflection of game strategies that can inform people about the competitors' performance. However, we must also take an alternate standpoint and remember that spectators would not likely expect an unbiased display of statistics regarding their opposing team\u2019s performance.\n6. Option D: \"One winner\". The word \u201cone\u201d is an important component in Option D because this could suggest a team with players wearing the same uniform color. When players wear the same team color, the team could be considered identical based on uniform color alone, and thus, only one winner's game performance should be reflected in the statistical data. This is the simplest to eliminate.\n7. Option E: \"Two winners\" is the correct choice. Spectators would likely expect to see different results based on which team had players wearing different uniform colors. Two winning competitors is a more accurate way of describing the state of competing teams for spectators who don't have a predisposition for one specific team.

A fish market is definitely not in the south pacific and even not in America itself.\n3: Let's go to choice B. Hawaiian waters seem like the perfect location to find blowfish, because Hawaii is a tropical paradise and blowfish naturally live in the tropics. \n4: Now let's look at choice C that states that the gulf of mexico is the perfect place for blowfish. We may be led astray in thinking so because blowfish are typically not found in the gulf of meixco, but gulf oil spills are one of the only well-known instances where blowfish made their way to the gulf.\n5: Now, let's look at the option E. The south pacific ocean is certainly a possible place for blowfish and would probably even be very close to America.\n6: Combining all the options, Hawaiian ocean waters sounds like an excellent place for blowfish and is close to America. It seems we should pick this option to move on.\n7: However, we still haven't quite arrived at choice A. The closest answer we have left to choice A in our sequence of answers is actually choice E. The south pacfic ocean is indeed very far away from America and would not be within the region of the question.

{"idx": 569, "text": "1) First, let's clarify the question to find the answer. The question asks about \"A place where you usually store... but not...\" The \"but not\" implies that there is a place where these things are stored, and the question is to focus on what isn't stored there. From this, we know there is a \"where\" to go. \n2. Based on that, let's eliminate one of the two options which doesn't have to do with \"a place\". We know the answer is not a place, so eliminate choices D: living room and E: shelf. \"Living room\" refers to the main area of the house where people and activities take place, and books can be stored there along with dishes. \"Shelf\" means a small surface for storing something and we can put books and other things there.\n3. Next, we examine the remaining options. Among them, only option C: table is a place to store both items. Choice B: pantry has nothing to do with either dishes or books. \n4. Choice A: apartment is a place to store dishes and not a books. But it is not the final answer.\n5. Choice D: living room isn't a suitable place to store dishes because it is where activities take place and people put their hands into and around. That eliminates it. Choice E: shelf doesn't work either, so let's look at answer choices once more.\n6. Only choice B: pantry refers to a place where you can keep dishes in separate places, so it is the answer. Thus, \"the place\" is a pantry.\nSo the finals answer is B: pantry\n\nInput: What is the least likely place to find a 30-second countdown clock?

This word implies a moving force that pushes one forward. There are plenty of potential feelings that might create action: confusion, fear, anger, etc. However, the answer requires that you choose one feeling that might propel someone to instituting civil actions.\n2. Starting from the end, \"civil action\" (E) is not a feeling, so eliminate that choice. \"Court case\" (D) could be a feeling, but it is the result of civil action, so that choice is not correct as it would not be the initial impetus. \n3. Moving to the middle, choices \"trial\" (C), \"complications\" (B), and \"anger\" (D) are all good possibilities, but can be combined into one choice. \"Trial\" and \"complications\" are feelings associated with instituting civil action, and \"anger\" can be a feeling that leads to instituting civil cases.\n4.

Phrases are typically short.\n3) We need to think about \"its source,\" \"its path,\" \"its destination\" \"its strength\" of Water. These could all be phrases, but this would be too broad of a definition of a phrase. They aren't phrases that describe Water.\n4) \"A: Water's source\" is referring to Water's origin, such as a river, rain, or stream. It doesn't describe Water in a way that is a phrase.\n5) \"B: Water", "answer": "B: buzz"}

Choices:  P: in the mountains Q: at sea R: on land S: within a desert T: near snow\nOutput: 1) The question asks \"Where could you find the place that has the lowest height on the map?\" So let's find the highest point on the map. 2) Mountains are the highest points on a map, but that is the opposite of what we want. So mountains are not the right answer. 3) That's it, we can eliminate 4) There are two choices at the lowest point on the map. We can eliminate R: near Sea (the sea has depth). 5) So S, is the answer that is within a desert.\nSo the final answers are S: within a desert\n\nInput: How many letters are in \"The\"? Choices:  A) 6 B) 7 C) 8 D) 9 E) 10\nOutput:1.) The question reads \"How many letters are in 'The?'\" So the first step is to examine the letters in the word \"The\" and see how many there are. 2.) There are T, H, and E in the word, which is three letters. 3.) The correct answer must be the answer that is greater than three. There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 such options. 4.) Because the correct answer is greater than three, the answer must be the largest choice, or \"E.\" 5.) So the correct answer is 10. Here, \"The\" has 10 letters.\nSo the final answe here is E: ten\n\nInput: Where would it be beneficial to see the sun before your vacation?

{"idx": 617, "text": "1) It would not make sense to say something like \"...only types of police help people\", so we know that the answer must be negative.\n2) The answer must involve an action. \n3) We can eliminate choices B and C because even if not all police officers board vessels or arm themselves, there would be no police left to help people, direct traffic, or find drugs. \n4) Of the remaining choices, D appears to be the most inclusive answer. While not all police officers will help people, it seems reasonable to assume that some do. Additionally, while not all police are present when a vessel is boarded, some of them will be. Also, not all weapons are guns -- all police have something to arm themselves with.\n5) A person could go to a police station to file a report and not interact with any police officers. It seems more likely that most encounters with police officers are on the street, where they are interacting with people. This is sufficient to make some police officers' role to help the people of the area they serve.\"So the final answer is Choice D: help people\n\nInput: A friend who has never lived in a state without palm trees is moving to Texas.

To answer the question, we should identify the key factors that influence grades.

A person may try to learn even with bad grades.\n5. \"Need assistance\" (D) is also not the answer because a person only needs assistance if they are having difficulty getting good grades.

{"idx": 645, "text": "1.First, let's understand what this question is saying by taking a closer look. \n2. The key phrase is \"a captive monkey\" which suggests the monkey is not free, but rather it is in captivity. \n3. There are many different places a captive monkey could be, but not all of them would make sense. \"Rain forest\" (B) is an outdoor area with plenty of plants. While it is possible a captive monkey may be found here, it would be very unlikely to be a monkey living there in the wild, so it is not the correct answer. \n4. \"Zoological gardens\" (D) are places that may contain captive monkeys, but the key to solving the question is looking for a place that is not a zoo. You know the solution will not be here because the question specifies that the monkey is not in a zoo. \n5. \"Great outdoors\" (E) is a descriptor for a location that is mostly outside and where \"great\" implies an extreme measure of being outside. Zoos are also \"outdoors\". So to solve this question, we consider areas that are specifically not meant to be outside. \n6. Considering this, \"toy store\" (C) is a place where you would not normally expect to find monkeys. Therefore, we can answer the question by eliminating \"Great outdoours\" (E) and choosing \"toy store\"(C) as the correct answer. 7. \"Tree tops\" (B) is also not the correct answer. This place could potentially contain monkeys, but it would be more likely to find one that would be either already been captured (\"captive\") or in the wild. This would make Tree tops a more likely location overall for a monkey than the toy store, but that is irrelevant to the question as it seeks a captive one.  8. Finally, we can conclude the correct answer is C: toy store. \nSo the final answer  is C: toy stire\n\nInput: From where does a person's ability to walk derive? Choices: 1.

A person that is outgoing is likely to seek new experiences with attractive and good looking people. \n3) Lastly, the question is asking about a specific personality trait, so the answer should exclude options C (\"their own house\") and D (\"attractive people\"). \n4) Therefore, the complete answer is \"good looking people\", and the correct answer is B: playfulness.\nSo the final question is why B: playfulness?\nBecause playfulness is one of the key characteristics of an outgoing person. \n\nInput: What do two things have in common when they are alike?

It would be incorrect as two things can be different without being the same or similar.\n3: There are two parts to this question, the commonality and location.\n4: Choice a (the same color): The first choice is too specific if the choice is to describe only the commonality of two things. This choice states that the two things must have the same color for all the objects to be alike, which leads to an outright contradiction.\n5: Choice b (in the same location): This option works because it does not state that the two items must be in the same location or different locations to be considered alike. Two items in the same location will always be alike, so this is the correct option.\nSo the final choice is why a) location?\nBecause \"in the same location\" is the most general answer. The correct answer to \"What do two things have in commmon when they are alike?\" is \"they are in the same location\".\n\nInput: Which foods are carbohydrates?

However, this is an infrequent use case where attendees at a conference may purchase food and eat it in a table, where conference staff or volunteer run it. This isn't a regular occurrence. \n6) \"Paper\" (D) is a material that can be purchased and used by individuals to make their own food that they can eat on tables. However, buying paper to make food is a less common usage that is more an extreme end case. \n7) Therefore, the choices are \"House\" (I) and \"Library\" (ii). \n8) The final answer then is \"House\" (i) and \"Library\"\nSo the final answer are 1. house and 2. library\n\nInput:How can I get a large pile of dirt?

Thus, the answer to the question is \"the antidote\". As shown previously, Sarah believed that the substance she thought was drinkable was actually an antidote. When this was her assumption, we have \"Sarah took poison\". The antidote then cured her so we have \"She found it in the cupboard and thought it was drinkable because she thought it was an antidote\". Since it wasn't an antidote, we have \"realised that it wasn' t\" and \"ate it anyway\". And we are given that \"she did not die\". Therefore, we must have an antidote to cure her and we have \"the antidote\" as the correct option.\nSo the finalanswer is A: antidote\n\nInput: In her house, Kate has the ______________ of a cake.

{"idx": 681, "text": "1: We know that the question is asking about a connection, so let's consider what that means. A connection implies a wire, which connects two points to create a pathway.\n2. Choice (A): Wires are a form of connection.\n3. If you don't know where to draw the line, it would make sense to eliminate options that are not connected. \"Electrical circuit\" (B) would be a connected piece of hardware, but is not a place. \"Computer network\" (C) is a virtual connection between computers, which is not a place.\n4. The remaining options are both possible choices. \"Wall\" (D) is a common place to find wires, as walls are often used for electrical and telephone wiring. \"Freeway\" (E) can also be a place with connected wires, although it is uncommon.\n5. Since there are multiple answers, choose the answer that makes most sense given the context of the question. Since you are unlikely to find electrical wires running between the cars on a freeway, and wires are a more common use of walls, you would likely need to interpret the answer as \"Wall\".\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: Freeway.\nSo the final is A: wires\n\nInput: Why haven't we found an acceptable answer so far? Choices: 1. A: We aren't sure 2.

{"idx": 697, "text": "1.) Where can someone purchase a contraception device? In order to answer this question, we need to understand the context and meaning of the word contraception.\n2.) The word contraception comes from the Latin prefix \"Contr\u00e2-\" meaning \"against,\" and the Latin verb \"Facere,\" which means to \"build, work, or make.\" Therefore, it is clear this means to make or build something without being pregnant, which is not relevant when purchasing contraceptives.\n3.) This clarifies our question, which now becomes \"Where can someone buy a contraception device without a prescription.\"\n4.) The answers are \"A\" (a pharmacy), \"B\" (a person), \"C\" (a drug store), \"D\" (a bedroom), and \"E\" (a McDonald's restaurant). All other options are irrelevant or cannot be correct answers.\n5.) Pharmacies and drug stores can sell contraceptive devices. However, they are subject to regulations that do not allow the sale of contraceptives without a prescription. In addition, it is possible that someone who is interested in buying contraceptives would not want to visit a pharmacy or drug store.\n6.) It is clear that a person can purchase contraceptive devices without a prescription. People buy contraceptive devices without having a need for a doctor's prescription, therefore this answer is the correct one.\n\nInput: How would you refer to 0.67 using words?

The answer choices are \"1 and a fraction\" (e) or \"five and a fraction\" (f).\n3. The number \"0.67\" does not come from fractions, and it is not divisible by 2, so it cannot be \"twelve and a half\".\n4. You cannot refer to \"0.677\" since it's not divisible by 3 and \"0.676\" likewise.\n5. You cannot refer to the number \"0.65\" with the common phrase \"three and a fraction\", since the two numbers do", "answer": "C: drugstore"}

That leaves \"Movie\" (B) as the answer because movies involve both movements and acting, both of which are taking place at a specific location, but neither involve the movements of an actual object taking place within the environment.\n5. Thus, the answer to the question is \"Movie.\"\nSo the final answer answer is B: Movie\n\nInput: What are many people wearing while they are driving their vehicles? Choices:  D: suits A: hats E: headphones G: glasses B: sunglasses C: goggles F: helmets\nOutput: 1: Suits (D) can refer to men's or women's outfits that provide warmth to the body. They do not necessarily have to be worn by men when operating vehicles.\n2. Sunglasses (B) and headphones (E) are both worn in similar circumstances; however, headphones simply cover ears while sunglasses are a type of eyewear that help protect the eyes from outside conditions while moving around town.\n3. It is also unlikely that many people wear hats (A) and helmets (F). Although people might wear hats sometimes, it is unlikely that they would be worn on a consistent basis, and they are not necessary in the same manner as helmets.\n4.

Choice E: \"Train station\" is incorrect because although shopping bags could be used in this location, they are not the most likely answer.\n5. Therefore the most likely answer is C: airport. You would store your shopping bags at an airport while you are waiting for your flight, or perhaps you've returned from a long flight and you'd store your shopping baggage here temporarily. \nSo the final answer ist C: airport\n\nInput:What food can you eat? Choices:  (1) A: fish B: cheese C: chicken (2) A: ham D: pork E: none F: beef G: sausage\nOutput:  (1) Fish, cheese, chicken and meat are all food and all can be eaten. Therefore choices A and B are correct. \"Ham\" and \"pork\" are both types of meat, therefore \"D\" and \"E\" are not correct because meat is not an answer.\n(2) None of choices \"F\", \"G\" and \"H\" is correct because \"ham\" is already an option that applies to meat and all options \"meat\", \"ham\" and \"pork are types of meat.", "answer": "D: shopping malls"}

The answer to finding lunch with a cannon is not going to be body armor (B), as that is for protection, not food hunting.\n3. Killing or attempting to kill people with a cannon is out of the question -- the question makes it clear this activity is just meant as a hunting game.\n4. That leaves the other three options: animals, ungulates, and bombers.\n5. Ungulates includes all hoofed mammals, and if shooting at ungulates was the goal, \"something\" could have been replaced with a more definite descriptor such as a \"herd of sheep.\" \n6. Lastly we have the choice \"animal.\" A specific animal could have been named, and using \"animal\" as a blanket term is not useful. However, we realize that James is trying to get lunch, so he would not be attempting to kill the animal, since \"lunch\" means the prey survives.\nInstead, James is likely to have targeted edible animals, such as a horse, boar, or cow. With that in mind, we understand that the answer is E: animal.\nSo the final output is E: animal\n\nInput: What's the best option for a group to enjoy their free time? Choices: 1.

It is the outdoor part (outdoor patio) of a house, which is not really a \"greater outdoor area\". \n3) That just leaves \"sidewalk\", which is a public area outside of a home. Therefore, it makes sense to be the answer.\n\nInput: When in a house what are", "answer": "C: shop"}

{"idx": 749, "text": "1. The question is worded strangely, but it's likely that the handbags would not contain \"certificates\" of some kind. Here are the reasons for each answer choice:2. A and B. The question asks about \"what\", which is the noun in the sentence. These answers are adverbs (\"illegitimate designer handbag will not have a CERTIFICATE of what...\") instead of a noun (\"Illegitimate designer will not have CERTIFICATE...\").\n3. Choice D, \"logical\" is a poor choice because a logical handbag is not what the question is asking for, but instead, a logical decision by a handbag designer to not include this particular certificate in their product.\n4. Choices E, \"Illegitimate\", is simply stating the condition of being illegitimate.\n5. Therefore the only answer choice which makes sense, and has a matching noun and isn't a word that modifies the sentence is B: legal.\n\nSo the final answeris B: Legal\n\nInput: Which of the following could not be a problem with the internet connection?

This means that we have to be in a location that involves meat (possibly steak) and corn.\n\n2) Then we find out more about the place. This could either be a steakhouse itself or a view of cornfields. In the former case, Choices A-E are all good options. In the latter case, Choice B and C are possible locations, but Choice D is ruled out because \"home\" is not a view of cornfields but rather a personal place to rest.\n\n3) Based on these constraints, Choice A (Nebraska) is the best answer.

If you have any standing water around you, such as a puddle, and you come to a stop, you may potentially end up lying down in the puddle. \n2) \"Lying in\" (D) is not the correct answer. While it is a form of stopping, standing up is an action a person cannot do while lying down.\n3) \"Sweating\" (B) is not the correct option. While sweat may accumulate on a person's body while they are lying in a puddle and they may also end up moving from their standing position to a lying position, these activities may also occur while a person is standing. \n4) \"Movement\" (C) is an incorrect answer. While movement can also be part of standing or lying, \"Movement\" is too ambiguous to be the correct answer.\n5) \"Walking out of\" (E) is the correct answer. A puddle is typically shallow in depth and a person may move into or out of it by just walking through and not necessarily stopping. In conclusion, the phrase \"End up stopping\" is in reference to a person who is standing and then, at some later time, chooses to lay down or moves from standing to lying down. Therefore, the answer to how a person could end up stopping standing in a puddles are either by choosing to be lying down or by moving away from their standing position.\nSo the final two choices are \"walking out of\" and \"movement\"\n\nInput:What happens to a person's head if they start doing the dishes while listening to music?

For example, a person has many small papers and they are the target. Other people do not have many small papers, but just one or two. The leader wants to take the lead with the small papers, which means they want to take the remaining small papers and therefore they are looking for a way to quickly take a lead and get more papers. Since the leader would firstly try to avoid the heavy games, the heavy game here is not a logical choice.\n3) B) is not the correct option since in video games taking a lead usually is not done with only small papers.\n4) Card game is definitely not the correct option either. Not only that, but C is not a lead paper game.\n5) D) E is correct because in a card game, you take lead by playing some cards.

This could be done by looking for a definition in the dictionary \nB: In the dictionary entry of \"processing\", it states \"the action of changing or improving something\". This would most likely only be applicable to things that can be improved. If it would not be possible to improve what is being processed, then it follows that option \"C\" (spinning wheel) or option \"E\" (rhythm) would not be the response. \nC: The answer is most likely processing the wool.

This would not be the ideal setting for a salesperson to make a sale, so this answer is incorrect.\n4. \"Bottom out\" (C): If a salesman is bottoming out, he or she has had to lower prices, terms, or conditions to get a sale. This also would not be suitable for the context of the question, as a salesperson must be professional in their approach to a sale.\n5. \"Go downtown\" (D): If a salesman \"goes downtown,\" he or she is either going to the big city or into the office building. Neither of these implies the salesperson is selling a car.\n6. \"Scream\" (E): If a salesman screams, he or she is being loud and unprofessional, which is an inappropriate behavior for a car dealership.\n7. The only answer choice that makes sense is \"roll over\" (E). When a salesman is \"rolling over\" on a customer, he or she accepts the customer's demand and lowers the price.\n\nInput: What are you looking for when shopping for shoes? Choices: 1.

It asks: \"To gain her trust the REAL estate agent was ____\", where \"REAL\" means to be truthful in a way that isn't lying.\n2. First, eliminate any choice that's not consistent with that objective. \"Manipulate\" (A) is a choice that can lead an agent to lying, but that's not what \"REAL\" is asking for. \n3. Similarly, \"Deceive\" (D), \"Exagerate\" (E), and \"Incompetent\" (E) are not the behavior that will lead to REAL estate's goal.  \n4. We will now look at the non-inconsistent behaviors. \"Charming\" (C) has a pleasant effect on someone that is associated strongly with being truthful. Thus, it can be a tactic to gain trust, but it isn't always so. \n5. Since our candidate choices match an objective for REAL estate, we must now consider which one would be the most likely. \n6. \"Charming\", \"Delightful\", and \"Polite\" seem to be all nice and charming traits the agent can rely on to get the job done.\n7. Therefore, the agent will likely use such tactics to gain the client's trust by being charming.\nSo the final option is C: charming\n\nInput: How can I know if a fish is cold-blooded?

However, it is unlikely to occur unless the person applying is already qualified. Also, a person who is unable to obtain employment is unlikely to be stressed.\n3. Option D: Working hard. This is not the solution because a person that doesn't have a job would not feel the need to work hard. That is, they would not be getting something of value out of the effort, nor would it be rewarded with money, which would make working hard a more desirable option.\n4. Option E: Love. This is also not the solution because a job search is not loveable. Instead, it is often challenging, and even frustrating to the person trying to find employment. It is unlikely that love is felt by a person on a job search unless it is unrequited and they have been rejected.\n5. The remaining options are B: Unemployment/Frustration, which is not what the question is asking, because there are too many variables at play here, such as why the person is unable to find a job, how long they have been looking, etc.\n6.

Part A, What was the wind like?, has the option \"dry hair\". While this can be associated with wind, it is not the main quality that helps us understand what the wind was like.\n22. Part A, What is the wind like?, has other options such as \"blowing hard\" and \"change direction\", which are more indicative of the type of wind involved.\n23. Once we have an understanding of the type of wind, we can then consider Part B, \"what did the wind do?\". From this part, we can eliminate \"wave wheat\" as this action is unlikely to cause damage to a shingled roof.\n24. That leaves us to choose between \"spreading\" and \"hard-blowing\". \"Spreading\" is likely not what happened as it does not cause damage to shingled roofs like the phrase \"tear off the shingles\" used in the sentence.\n25. Therefore, the correct answer is \"blowing hard\". By using this terminology, we can understand that the wind was probably high in speed and force.\nSo the final answers are B: blowing hard.\n\nInput: I have found it best to eat the strawberries and not the rind.

Let's take a look at each of the answer choices and see if they fit the requirement. \n2.1) \"Safeway\" is a grocery store.\n2.2) \"Record albums\" is a record album. Although this may seem obvious at first, let's investigate further. A record album, also known as a vinyl record, is typically composed of multiple records that contain songs or other audio recordings. A record album cannot \"buy listening vinly\", since it does not contain any listening vinyl.\n2.3) \"Record store\" is a place that sells record albums. It is a type of store that specializes in selling vinyl records. It seems that the record store would be the most appropriate answer for our question, as it is a place that selling record albums. However, further investigation of this answer choice reveals that the \"record store\" answer does not make sense for our question either. A record store may sell record albums, but it is not a place to \"buys listening vinyl\".\n3) We are now left with the three remaining answer choices.\n3.1) \"Car\" is a car. Although it may seem like the car answer choice would be the correct one, let's review to see if it fits with our understanding of the question. A car can hold a variety of items, but it is unlikely that it would hold \"listening vinyl\".\n3.2) \"Wallpaper\" is a wallpaper.

Choices:  Answer: A: the bell B: the watch C: the hour-glass D: the minute hand E: the minute man F: the second hand\nOutput: 1) The options are as follows: \n2) A: \"The bell\": this is incorrect because a clock cannot strike a bell.\n3) B: \"The watch\": this is not related because the question is about striking an hour-glass and watches are not involved.\n4) C: \"The hourglass\": this is not an answer because an hourglass does not strike anything.\n5) D: \"The minute-hand\": this is correct because the minute-hand is what strikes when a clock strikes. Other parts of a clock such as the number-hand and the pendulum may also strike, but the minute-hand is the key answer. \n6) F: \"The second-hand\": this is not an option because the question explicitly states that we are discussing striking an hour-glass. \n7) E: \"The Minute-Man\": this is correct because \"Minute Man\" refers to a clock that strikes something in exactly one minute, whereas other clocks typically strike more often.\nSo the final choices have 2 answers: the correct answer is C: the hour-Glass (which can be struck) and D: the Minute-", "answer": "E: office supply store"}

This action is a passive state that the horses have to live in!\n  d) Choice (D): Horses do not dominate as an energy source for themselves, making this unlikely.\n    e) Choice (E): Horses do drink water, not coffee. This cannot be the correct answer because drinking coffee doesn\u2019t give them energy. At most, it helps them relax, which is a state that follows from getting enough sleep.\n3) The correct answer is choice (C) \u2013 when horses are kept in stables, they have a passive role.

{"idx": 917, "text": "1) The question: \"There are a lot of things to relax with, for this person, what would they need to open the case with?\" The word \"with\" helps us understand that we're specifically looking for an opening tool. Some options like a light switch have an alternative, but \"opening one up\" (choice A) is clearly referring to using a tool or tool(s).\n2) Choices (A) through (E) each represent something that could be necessary to open a case, like a key, screwdriver, knife or pliers. The key differentiator between choices (A) through (C) and (D) and (E) is the specific item that is needed to open the box. For example, knives (A) and screwdrivers (B) both do the job fairly easily. \n3) Choices (D) and (A) are easy eliminations since they are not what this person needs to open up a box. \n4) Choice (E) should immediately be eliminated because a book is not what this person needs, since the case would need to be opened first. It is also a bit outside of the context of relaxing, even though opening a book could be relaxing as well. \n5) That leaves us with just the two remaining answers that are options that are in the context of relaxation: (C) warm drink and (B) warm coat. It comes down to which is what this person needs to help them open the box. While they clearly both have the potential to relax someone, a choice (B) warm coat is required to open the box.\n6) Therefore, we can confidently say that the answer to this question is (B) warm coat\nSo the final answer for this one is B: warm coat\n\nInput: What could you use in your garage?

{"idx": 929, "text": "Let's start with the answers we know are not the correct answer to the question. \"Worthy\" (E) is not the right answer choice because Mary was a bad girl; she was never worthy. \"Fun\" (B) is also not the right answer because Mary is not the sort of person to be fun. \"Open\" (C), while not incorrect, is not the right answer either because Mary is open about being a bad girl, not about being worthy or fun or a good choice. \n2. That leaves us with two potential answers: \"Excellent\" (A) or \"Choice\" (D).  To determine which of these words correctly answers the question, consider what \"bad\" denotes.  Bad implies not good in some way, whether it be a personality trait, an event, a score on an exam, the quality of an asset, or some other sort of value.  Therefore, a bad girl isn't excellent, choice, fun, or worthy; a bad event or a bad thing may be a choice, but a bad woman is never one. \n3.

To narrow down our choices, begin by ruling out the incorrect options. \"Being tired\" is not the answer because it might lead to a full stomach or fatigue but might not affect hunger. \"Working out\" is not the answer either because this activity can cause hunger in some people but not others. \n3. In the end, \"Having lunch\", \"Being tired\", and \"Working out intensively\" don't fit for", "answer": "C: honest"}

There are several different environments where such long-necked critters can be found. A giraffe could live in a zoo, as zookeepers take careful measures ensure their care, such as feeding, water and shelter.\n2. A giraffe can live in a city, as long as the city is clean and there are no predators in the area.\n3. A giraffe would not live in the desert as its habitat is dependent on having adequate food sources.\n4. A giraffe lives in the wild and can therefore not live in the forest due to the scarcity of suitable habitat in the area.\n5. Finally, a giraffe does not live in the savannah.\n6.

Choice C: shelf: A shelf is merely storage for products, which does not contain teddy bears. A shelf is not where a teddy bear can be purchased.\n3. Choices B: bed and E: toy store: These are both logical choices for buying a teddy bear. However, to better understand the answer, we focus on whether the bear is for the buyer or for the buyer\u2019s child.\n4. Bed: The bear would be for the buyer, as the person is going to buy one for themselves and would likely not want to sleep with a teddy bear. \n5. Toy store: The location of the toy store may or may not be what influences the decision to purchase a teddy bear. Therefore, we focus on whether or not the bear is for the user.\n6. Choice A: thrift store is the best choice because the teddy bear is on the shelf to be bought by a buyer, thus it\u2019s a place someone can buy a teddy bear.\n7.

Living longer would be \"too much meals\" rather than \"too much dinner\" and acid reflux would be \"too strong food\" rather than \"to much dinner\". This is indication that the result of eating too much is more about physical health rather than time-related factors like living longer or the feeling of reflux.\n4. Choices A and B \"tiredness\" and \"living longer\" are not sufficient as the result in the question because they do not match the phraseology or the association of the question (\"if you eat too much dinner\"). \"Tiredness\" is not a physical effect as a result of eating too many meals.

Choices: 1: A: scarcity 2: B: abundance 3: C: lack 4: D: increase 5: E: decrease\nOutput: 1) \"Scarcity\" is a value that causes some people to feel poorer. 2) Scarcity also causes people to feel poorer, thus there would be a decrease in value. 3) A lack of something (like paper towels) could increase it's value by increasing demand. 4) If something is in excess, it is generally considered to be of less value than when it is in short supply. \nSo the answer is B: scarcity.\n\nInput: During winter, what doesn\u2019t a bird need?

{"idx": 68, "text": "1) Let's begin with each answer choice, examining whether the meaning of the choice could be an indication of what the answer to the question is. \n2) Answer A: Making love. Making love may be an option that can occur between two people, but it is not a necessary component between every sex act, so it cannot be the answer that \"sex often makes happen in people\".\n3) Answer B: Feeling good. Feeling good is a possible result of an act of sex, but it is far from the most common outcome and may not be necessary.\n4) Answer C: Happiness. Similar reasoning to A and B. \"Sex often makes people happy\" does not make sense; it is more likely that sex is sometimes followed by happiness, but the happiness could stem from other sources as well.\n5) Choice D: Wondrous thing. Again, like previous answer choices, this could be something that can occur, but not a necessary thing that sex \"often makes happen in people\". \n6) Choice E: Cloud judgment. \"Cloud judgment\" and similar phrases are commonplace in popular culture, but they do not fit with the context of this question. Sex does not \"make people's judgment clouded\". Instead, this phrase is used to indicate the lack of clarity after drinking alcohol.\n7) Comparing answers A - E, the only answer that could possibly fit the question is D: Wonderful thing. Sex is indeed a wonderful thing (with many positive outcomes). While there are negative consequences to sex, they are not the likely result, especially when asking about sex in general.\n8) Concluding, the answer is D: Wonderful things. \nSo the final answer \n\nInput: What could I buy at a market?

The correct answer should be an explanation of why he made another call.\n3) As I mentioned before, answer A: hang up, answer B: respond, and answer E: attracting birds are equivalent. I think that the second answer, answer C: contact, is what the question is asking about because it can be related to the reason he made another call. He might have made another call because people were contacting him back and he wanted to make another call to contact them.\n4) For me, answer C: contact seems the most logical answer.\nSo the final answers are C: contact\n\nInput: What can the teacher say to the students about their assignment?

Oceania was ruled by a Big brother and his government, The Inner Party. Big brother and his government did not want the citizens of Oceania to have any secrets from each other and were constantly afraid of other citizens having secrets. The most dangerous thing a person could have was a thought they were not supposed to share with the government and the rest of the citizens. These secret thoughts were called 'Thought Crimes'. These Thought Crimes were punishable by the thought police and could result in a person's life being made unbearably bad and sometimes even death.\n\nOne day, many children's of Oceania found out that their parents had secrets which they had not said before they became adults. The children could not accept this and they had to do something to get their parents back in line to what the government had expected. The children of Oceania all had the same secret, they loved to sing.\n\n\n\n\n### Instructions: \n\n1.

This is certainly a very real outcome of intoxication, but it doesn\u2019 t tell us what the person can do at that point in time. \n8. The correct answer is Option B: Falling Down, because this is the most likely scenario. \n9. A drunk person is more likely to fall over than to engage in fights or lose inhibitions. \n10.

We have to determine what it is that cats are getting into.\n2: Looking at option answer choices, it might seem that \"dogs' mouths\" (B) is the correct answer. This is because the dog in the question is ripping things apart, so it may seem like cats would also get into its mouth. However, cats could also be getting into their OWN mouths, which is what option A states.\n3: The verb \"get into\" could also be interpreted as \"find\", which is supported by the word \"ripping\" in the sentence. A cat could find something by digging or looking. \"Dog's mouth\" (B) does not contain the word \"dig\" or \"look\", so it is most likely not the correct answer.\n4: \"Garage\" (C), while it could potentially have scraps or ripped things there, is not the correct answer because that is where cats get INTO.\n5: Similarly, \"Trouble\" (E) could be in the dog's mouth, but it is not the correct answer word because \"Trouble\" is not a tangible object that is being torn up. Additionally, \"Trouble\" would be too subjective to answer the question with certainty.\n6: Therefore, most likely, \"Nature\" is where cats are getting into things - or getting into nature, if you will.\n7: Thus, the answer is C: Nature.\nSo the final  answer is C: Nature\n\nInput: Where would a person go to make something smell good?

The question asked what I would bring to a football game. This means if we were going to a football game, we would be taking anything that we might bring to a football game with us. \n4) That clears up the first part of the question because a football game and a soccer game are both games. We can eliminate everything that will not be played in a football game. That leaves us with the options B and D. \n5) B) \"Bagging the field\" is a phrase used to signal what we can do to prepare a playing field for the game - set up the bags and tape down the lines. Because this means we are going to prepare the field, this is not an option as it does not directly answer the question. \n6) D) The last option is \"snacks.\" We can also get clues from knowing that we are going to a football game. Snacks are commonly brought to a football game, and might be an appropriate answer in some cases, which makes it a good candidate. \n7) Based on the above information, we can answer the question correctly!

If Sam was already in France then he would not need to order a blowfish in Paris.\n3. Choices A: books and D: atlantic Ocean: are irrelevant to the question because of the way they are worded. In the question we are asked \"where was Sam\" so the context of the question requires us to think about where France is in the world and what would be in that location.\n4. Choices C: fish market, and E: cuba: also are incorrect because the question asks about Sam's location and neither of these places are in the same location Sam ordered a blowfish.\n5.

Likely, this would be an area where hunting was prevalent, which excludes: \"Grassy Field\" (D) as there is little hunting there, \"England\" (E) as it is a country and not a state, \"Inside Joke\" (C) as this one is a type of humor and not an environment, \"Tennessee\" (B) as it is a state and not an environment. \n4.

This is a location where many might use a fire extinguisher, but fire extinguish are not typically in garages.\n4) B: Hospital. This sounds like a great place to have many fire extinguish, but hospitals do not typically have many of these devices.\n5) C: Boat. It makes sense for the location with many fire extinguisher to be a place with many fire extinguisers, but this choice mentions only one fire extingisher.\n6) D: House. Houses definitely have fire extinguishing devices, but they must be the specific items requested here. The description of a lot does not fit the wording here.\n7) E: Doll House. A doll house does not seem like the type of place that would use many fire extinguishment devices.\n8) Now we need to combine the criteria of being a place where many fire extinguishes are likely to be used and of having many of these devices, as well as being the items requested in this question.\n9) The correct answer is: house.

However, all of these are things that could occur after getting paid, not necessarily as a result of receiving payment itself.\n2. Look closer at paying bills because this is an action that could occur before or after getting paid. Paying bills directly relates to money and spending it, so this choice indicates a possible response. \n3. Now consider happiness. Happiness, in the context of getting paid, would be because the amount was expected or higher than expected. However, this happiness might not result from getting paid; getting paid could coincide with happiness, but it isn't necessarily the cause of happiness. \n4. Lastly, consider frustration. Frustration could also be a response when getting paid because the amount is lower than expected, or other circumstances surrounding the pay could lead to frustration. Nevertheless, the feeling may also happen long after getting paid, so it's not the correct choice.\n5. Thus, we can determine that the correct answer is D: frustration.\nSo the final answers are D: frustration\n\nInput: What happens in a grocery store? Choices: \n1. Fruit 2. Meats and cheese 3.

This is obviously incorrect as there is no possible way to define a \"massive\" building as \"insubstantial\". \n3. Option B: Massless.

This is certainly not a valid choice as it does not match the criteria presented. \n5. Option D: Inconsequential. This is incorrect because an \"inconsequential\" thing does not necessarily have to be bad, so it could not by definition be a \"massive\" structure. \n6. Lastly we look at Option E: good.

If you are feeling uncomfortable or need more time to think about what you learned, you might wait until later to talk to that person.\n4. This leaves us with \"Learning about\" (E). This choice is the best answer because it explains why someone might want to continue talking to somebody who just shared something new with them. Not only does learning new things keep conversations going, but it also provides a reason to continue talking with the other person since they will likely share new information over time.\nSo the final choice is E: learning about\n\nOutput: 1) To fill  their time\n2) to fill  their time", "answer": "E: learning about"}

To determine which choice is correct, we need to understand what phrase the question is asking about. \"They were on their way to\u2026the\u2026.\" The question is asking about an action that will occur after they are on their way to paradiso.\n3. This is in line with Choice E\u2014\"Surprise Us\"\u2014because this is the one action in the question that is about what will happen when they are on their way, and can be inferred to be positive for the outcome. \n4. This eliminates Choices B, C and D, because the action cannot occur where they are currently at. \"Look beautiful\" (B), \"Be happy\" (C), and \"Change quickly\" (D) are not happening in the present location of \"on the way to paradise.\"\n5. \"Surprise\" can be interpreted as something that will result in happiness, so the answer is \"Surprise Us.\"\nSo the final answer should be SURPRISE US\n\nInput: What will my doctor do if I go see her in the middle of the night? Choices:  a: Tell me you don't want any more children in your family, b: tell me my insurance won't help, c: say you don't make house calls d: ask me a question e: ask me to leave\nOutput: 1: \"The night is the worst time to see a doctor,\" as this is the last thing I will think of if I want to do this, this doesn't rule out anything more important from the other choices. \n2: \"I will tell you I don't take insurance\" can be said to patients after anything else has gone on, as long as that is their last move, so this doesn't rule anything else out.\n3: \"I will tell that you I don't do house calls,\" is the same as number 2, as it depends on what's happening with the other choices, if they haven't been handled yet, this could happen.\n4: \"I will ask you to leave,\" doesn't rule anything out other than an emergency, as a doctor could say that to a patient at any point as long as it's not", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}
{"idx": 204, "text": "1) Let's first examine the possible errors. \"Drill\" and \"thief\" are spelled improperly and do not fit within the context. It is grammatically incorrect to compare the two verbs \"drill\" and \"committed\". There is no proper noun that can replace the pronoun \"that\" so that it makes sense within the sentence. \n2) Let's then consider the possible proper nouns that would make sense in the context. \"A master of their craft\" can be changed to \"a master of any art form\", indicating the broad scope of possible applicability. \"What\" can be switched to \"who has\" or \"what has\", since the subject of the verb does not refer to any specific thing or object. In turn, it is not clear what the proper noun would be here. \n3) One option would be to use the noun \"himself\" and put \"himself\" in place of \"that craft\". This would create a correct, grammatically logical sentence in which a craft can refer to a craftsman, thereby making the answer choice \"master\" and correcting the grammar error. This would give us the correct answer of \"himself\".\nSo the final answer 3: himself", "answer": "D: learn"}

This isn't the correct answer for this question because we're trying to find what he has problems with.\n\n4) Ineligent (which is also one word and not an acronym like the other abbreviations) (C) also doesn't answer our question, because it means incapable or incompetent. Since we're using math as an example, which is generally known as a very exact science, he's definitely not incapable of doing good math.\n\n5) Ocean (D), unlike some of the other answers, does provide an answer that answers our question; which is that his math calculations could be inaccurate or he could make mistakes.\n\n6) Inaccurate isn't the same word as dull (E) (which also doesn't mean the same thing as inaccurate). He could have been accurate, and yet still make mistakes.\n\nSo the final answer would be D: could be inaccurately.", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

Because one can not only find a squash court in a public park. Because \"Public\" in this sentence refers to government. And a government or town court would always be public and free of charge.\n4) So we can now narrow it down to Choice C. \"Squash Court in a Rich Person's House\". Because rich people will always have more access to public facilities.\n5) So, The Answer is C.\nSo the final question is C: Squash Court in a rich person's house.\n\nInput: If you need something from the basement, what will you probably have to find it on the floor?

Choices C & E: Attic and ground floor are also good answers. Attics do not have floors, so we can eliminate them. The question talks about finding something on the floor.

The items are probably old and not in good condition, hence \"historic\", not just historical. As a result, they're unlikely to be in good condition. In fact, they're probably going to be messy.\n4. \"Attic\" is the storage area for that type of home. Think of the top portion of the house which is elevated off the ground and can't be accessed by stairs, like in a large building. This area is where you're going to find historic items in a top of the home.\n5. This leaves us with A, which is the top of the home, and D, which is an owned home.\n6. Compare the items in each choice. In top of the home, there is a high chance that historic items could be found, and in owned home, the probability is higher, and it is therefore more likely to find historic items in the attic.\n7.

{"idx": 236, "text": "1.\"The camper looked up the the vast night sky, then felt...\" The camper is experiencing or feeling something. \nSo the next thing on our list is \"mighty\", which refers to the camper, not the sky. \"Mighty\" is in the adjective and adverb categories, so it describes the camper. \n2.Next are the feeling adjectives. \n\"Unimportant\" (A) and \"helpless\" (E) relate to the camper, so they are out. \"Insignificant\" (B) means that a person or object isn't important, and would imply that the camper is something that isn't important, so \"Insignificant Camper\" doesn't fit the description of the scenario. \n3.Next are the emotion adjectives. The words \"stellar\" (D) and the phrase \"somewhat\" (C) seem like strong fits for the description, but they actually don't really match because \"feeling\" in the sentence is an adjective, not an emotion. In fact, \"somewhat\" is an adverb. \n4.The phrase \"mighty what\" is actually asking what the camper is feeling, so the answer is \"mighty what he feels\". In other words, the answer is \"mith he felt\" (E).\nSo the final answer might be  E: he felt\n\nInput:The first thing I do every year is... What time in the day?

Therefore, Patience is out.\n4) (C) Let's look inside and see what \"great deal\"  really means. This is one of the key factors in this question (because if not, the answer would be either one of \"A\", \"B\", or \"D\").  \n5) Is this a phrase that's referring to some arbitrary number? If it was, then this would be like asking \"What do you need to make an enriched cake? A lot, that's what. Can we get some icing? A lot?\"\n6) As we can see, this answer implies a great amount, meaning that the quantity is large enough for the child's school to be considered  sufficient.  \n7) We now know it is time but not that it is a \"great deal\" of time. Therefore, we must keep that in mind. Time is not the proper answer here.\n8) (D) Is it possible that the answer could be teachers? The answer here certainly does have to do with a group of people, but that group could be anybody like police officers or grocery store clerks and managers who are not educators.\n9) On top of this, a bunch of teachers in my mind doesn't imply that you need a specific quantity, rather it implies just simply that they are there. It is enough to say that there are teachers in the school.\n10) Let's look deeper to eliminate teachers... What are they needed for? To teach students. But, a \"great deal of what\" does not refer to just the act of teaching it refers to the entire idea of what can be done inside an educational institution.

Although it seems logical that good credit would be useful, this is not what the question is asking for.\n3. Choices C & D: Smooth skin and fresh produce. These seem irrelevant to the question.\n4. Choices A & E: Fresh smell and fresh produce. These choices seem less likely because fresh produce is consumed and smells are inhaled, suggesting the person is actively seeking this smell. Therefore, the answer must be either A or E.\n5. Choice A: Fresh Smell. Whenever you use a new lotion, you typically want it to smell fresh, which is the correct answer.\nSo the final  answer is A: fresh smell\n\nInput: You would not want to run out of _______ at your camping trip.

Choice B: \"Library\" (B) refers to an institution of books, and is not necessarily associated with dictionary books.\n3. Choices \"Table\" (C) and \"desk\" (D) are both pieces of furniture where dictionaries may very well be found and could be used in this scenario. However, it isn't clear that these choices are places to keep the loose dictionary, so they may not have enough context to answer this question. \n4. Option E: \"classroom\" (E) can be both a place and a type of library, so it could potentially be where the dictionary belongs.\n5. Option A: \"Mother\" (A) is our focal character in this question, and it is implied by the question that this loose dictionary is in their house. \n6. Comparing the different answer choices, it is clear that \"desk\" (C) and potentially also \"classroom\" (A) are the most likely places that a loose dictionary would end up.

That leaves us with options A: \"Cabinet\" and C: \"Pantry.\" A pantry is a specialized storage space, usually not available in all houses, but a cabinet would be more likely. \n4. We know that the correct answer is one of the remaining choice because it's either be stored in a cabinet or a pantry - two options that have already been eliminated.\n5.

What happens if the person Jimmy is going to try to get a beer from is an alcoholic on alcoholic probation?\n2. The answer must be that Jimmy can not go to his wife's house because she is an alcoholic.\n3. If Jimmy goes to the Bridge, then there will be a conflict of the probation rules.\n4. The same is true for his home. He can not go home because of its proximity to his wife.\n5. Jimmy cannot go to the homeless shelter because not everyone gets to be homeless. But the reason why they are homeless is because their behavior is unacceptable in normal society.\n6. Prison is what Jimmy needs to go to. Even though his wife is on probation and he does not wish to commit a crime by bringing alcohol, the prison gives people a chance to make a change and move on to a better life.\n7.

{"idx": 288, "text": "1 Let's start with option D because this is an exact opposite condition of obtuse. When we are talking about a straight edge in geometry, obtuse angles are larger than 90\u00b0 but less than 180\u00b0.\n2. Option C says, \"Easy\". However, the question is asking about something being obtuse. Obtuse angles are by definition, not easy!\n3. Similarly, option B is talking about something being \"bright\", but that would be exactly contrary to obtuse angles' definition.\n4. Option E is also not correct because acute angles are exactly opposite - the opposite of obtuse angles is acute angles. Acute angles are less than 90\u00b0.\n5. This leaves us with A & B. \n6. The definitions tell us we are looking for something that is not obtuse, which means we have 2 options - one option must be obtuse.\n7. We can narrow our options down to two. We are looking for something that isn't obtuse, and one of the possibilities is obtuse.  \nBut neither of these options is quite enough. If one of the options were obtuse, then it could still meet the \"not\" phrase. But one of them must be obtuse, so it is possible that both are obtuse. \n8. Now, this can't be correct because one of them must be contrary to a document. So, we're left with one of the options being obstuse.\n9.

The answer 'C' does not make sense, as it does not give the student any time to apply what they read or heard.\n3.

Similarly, \"envelope\" would be an incorrect location as the mail is the wrong place to find a melody.\n4: \"Medical Chart\" is similar to \"Classroom\", which is also incorrect because a \"Medical Chart\" does not indicate a melody.\n5: Lastly, \"Sheet Music\" is the correct answer because this would be very common for a melody to be in sheet music form.\nSo the final analysis is:  Sheet Music, which is the correct answer.\n\nInput: When someone opens a door, what might happen?

The Choice B: There are no doors to open is incorrect as well because if you are opening a door, then there is another door that you are opening.\n3: The Choice C: There is nothing to bump The Choice C: is also incorrect because if a person opens a door, there is something to hit, which is something on the other side of the door.\n4: The Choice D: the door falls off its hinges is incorrect because if the door is stuck on its hinges, the door would not open when someone opens it.\n5: The choice E: There might be no doors to open is the first correct option because when somebody opens a door, there will potentially be another door that can be opened, but it is not obligatory.\nSo the final conclusion is: There might be no other door to open, which is the correct alternative answer.\n\nInput:\"Why is it important to wear a hat in the snow?\"  Choices:  A \"I'm cold\"  B \"Because h", "answer": "E: sheet music"}

This means that one possibility is that the parents could be referring to throwing things like balls or darts.\n3) However, \"play ball\" (C) has the term \"ball\" within the phrase and that word is also used to refer to throwing a ball. For example, someone might say \"I need to go play ball\" which would imply throwing a ball. Thus, the \"play ball\" phrasing may potentially be a form of throwing things.\n4) As we look at the different sports, \"play sports\" (A) could potentially be a reference to sports where a team aspect is involved, and there are many sports that fall into this category.

Option A: vent, is not the answer. Option A: vent is a narrow pipe used to draw out unwanted smoke and gases in an enclosed room, so nothing is being produced or released in this scenario. \nOption B: think could be the answer. Option B: think could be something akin to the release of nervous energy via mental activity and it could happen in any part of the body not solely muscles. \nOption C: shouting could be a correct answer. Option C: shouting could also occur in any part of the human body. \nOption D: work off could be the correct answer. Option D: work off could release energy from muscles not just release energy in general. \nOption E: exercise could be the correct choice. Option E: exercise could be something that occurs in either skeletal muscle or cardiac muscle. \nOption B and C and E could be the answer. The correct answer would be choice D as work off could release energy in just muscles.\nSo the final choice is D: exercise.\nA lot of energy is being consumed (1-3) while muscles are being pushed to their limit (4 & 5), however due to muscle fatigue (6), not much energy is actually being released (7 & 8).

The only reason for that would be if they are in a really deep sleep or unconscious.\", The question does not assume that someone who is awake isn't able to know what's happening. The only assumption is that someone who isn't awake isn't even awake.\n2.Let's look at what makes someone awake, and what makes someone not awake.\n3.In order to be awake, someone's eyes need to be opened.\n4.If their eyes aren't open, that means they're closed, which is a state of \"asleep\", where a person is unable to interact with the outside world.\n5.Because being awake requires someone's eyes to be open, their eyes are a marker for being awake.\n6.If someone's eyes are open, then they can interpret and understand what's happening in the environment. \n7.It's possible for an awake person to be drowsy or tired and have difficulty focusing.\n8.If that were the case, we could replace the word awake with \"conscious.\"\n9.Therefore, the answer is C: dring coffee.Someone who is alert, on the other hand, is awake and conscious.\n\nSo the final answer with some addition is C: drink coffee\n\nInput:What will not the bride want to see on her wedding day?

In a race, humans will often eat fruit and drink water. That is not the answer, but can be eliminated.\n3. \"Lay eggs\" is not the answer, as humans are not laying eggs. Additionally, competing against other humans implies competing against other humans, so humans won't lay eggs either.\n4. \"Wrestle\" would not be the answer either, which is another form of competition with a human opponent that does not involve laying eggs or drawing pictures.\n5.

Choices:  Sleep wear A: suit B: sweater C: pajamas D) overalls E: dress\nOutput: 1 Let's eliminate the choices that don't fit the requirements.\n2. Choice B: sweater, can be eliminated. A suit is a type of clothing that is often worn by professionals in an appropriate environment, which includes office workers, lawyers, bankers etc. A sweater on the other hand, is worn by people doing various activities under various situations, and cannot be said to be appropriate for a specific environment or group.\n3. Options C and E cannot be the answer because the question is asking you about who would you expect to see wearing the suit and these are clothing types that would not necessarily be exclusively expected to be worn. There could be various other clothing types that would fit the description, but still it would be appropriate to ask about the suit itself.\n4. Choices A, B, and D are not directly related to the question because suit can be a generalized answer. A person would be expected to wear a suit for a business meeting, a court trial, or a wedding ceremony, and could therefore also be expected to wear the suit for formal purposes at an everyday job, a special occasion (ex. Halloween party), or during a break, respectively.\n5. Therefore Choice D: overalls, is the only answer choice that fits the", "answer": "D: compete with each other"}

Curiosity is a desire to acquire knowledge about something, and viewing enjoyment is the satisfaction that someone experiences from watching a show. Together these ideas form the question \"What if I'm not experiencing curiosity and I want to ensure that I'm watching a show that I'll like?\" \n2)The key here is \"I want to ensure viewing pleasure\". This indicates that you are trying to select a show that you will enjoy watching, which in itself is a form of curiosity because you want to acquire knowledge about what show you will like best. This curiosity is separate from watching a show, or enjoying it, which you want to make sure you do.  \n 3)Let's start by eliminating the options that do not have to do with a television show. \"Examine thing\" (A) is not about watching a TV show and does not satisfy the requirement that it also be one that you will enjoy watching. It is a passive activity because it does not have viewing enjoyment as part of it. \"Stare into a mirror\" (B) is also not directly related to watching a TV show because you aren't watching something else; you are just looking at yourself. \"Go somewhere\" (C) does not specifically say that the object of your desire is a TV show or that the TV show will be enjoyable to watch - they simply go together, without satisfying the condition that you need to ensure watching enjoyment. \n4)Option D: \"Hear the news\" (D) is not directly about a TV show, nor does it ensure that you will enjoy watching a show. The news typically contains information, not entertainment. Option E: \"See a favorite show\" (E) is a type of TV show, but it's already part of your preferred shows and does not require that you ensure the viewing enjoyment. \n5)Comparing the remaining options, we see that option B: \"see a favorite show\" fails the viewing pleasure condition. The only option left is to watch a show that doesn't have to meet the condition of ensuring viewing enjoyment to be chosen, which leaves us with option C: \"Go somewhere\". \n6) Therefore, the answer is C: Go somewhere.   \nSo the final answer to", "answer": "E: see favorite show"}

Choices: A: we don't know it is clean B: because of bacteria C: we drink different amounts D: we are different people E: too fast\nOutput: 1: The clean part of this question is already answered. There is nothing that can make it impure. \n2: The source of all the clean water is the same, which is rain. But different people drink different amounts of water (46%) to maintain their bodies' water levels without dehydrating which can be up to 2/3 gallons per day. Since water is an essential nutrient and most people cannot live without it, each person needs to have their own, personal water source that suits their hydration needs.\n3: The answer is A: we don' t know it is clean.\nSo the final is A: we don\u2019t know it is clean\n\nInput:Why doesn't a baby eat food until they are older?

This isn't a place, so we can eliminate A and B (Drive through town, drive by a sign)\n2. Then we take off the questions that don't make sense. For example, D (Tour) doesn't quite make sense in this context.\n3. Then again, it's impossible for the president to take a trip, if he's the president.\n4. And that leaves us with only three possibilities: C, because if the president went for a drive, he'd end up actually driving in town and by a sign. E, since the president goes on vacations.\n5.

In this case, there were a large number of large containers.\n2. Looking at the remaining choices, \"factory\" would not be the correct answer because that is a place to create large containers. Similarly, \"garden\" would not be appropriate because that is a place for small gardening tools.\n\n3. \"Supermarket\" is also unlikely to contain large containers and cannot be the answer. The phrase \"warehouse\" is used to refer to a large space used for storage, and thus would also not be the correct answer. \"Garage\" typically refers to a large space next to a house, but would not necessarily contain a variety of large containers.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be \"warehouse\".

E: in the garage.\nOutput: 1.'You were able to enter this room with the key to the door' implies you were using the door as a key to unlock the room.\n2. Choice 'C' is not an appropriate answer because this room was locked and needed a key to enter. 'D' is also unreasonable because it is impossible to access a rooftop with a key.

Choices: \tA: lions B: tigers C: rhinoceros D: polar bears E: pandas\nOutput: 1.`Let's understand the question first.` \"In a large city\" means there will be more people to consider, so we need to eliminate options with lower population densities. \"Zoo\" makes us think about wild animals, so we need to rule out places where domesticated animals live. \"Polar bears\" can be in zoos, but not all will be in large cities. \"Panda\" doesn't really fit, so there is no need to look for pandas. \n2.`The rest of the choice have different noun types such as `lion` and `tiger`, which are animals, so `lions` should be the answer.`\nSo the final answer choice is A: lions.\n\nInput: In what condition would someone receive an allowance?

This implies that we're looking for something cold, but we're actually considering what is inside the fridge.\n4) Lastly, \"Party\" (S) is not the place where we'd keep cake and ice creams together. We're looking for a specific cake or ice creamy combination, so this is not the right choice. \n5) Looking at the rest remaining, we can see that \"D\" is \"Served Cold\", which is an appropriate option but misses out the word \"Cake\".

However, when you think about it, there isn't really a specific neighborhood where a yard is tiny because yards don't need that specific definition.\n4. \"The city\" cannot be the answer, because cities range in size from tiny towns to large cities.\n5.\"The property\" cannot be the answer. Even small properties may still have large areas that are not used for a particular purpose and therefore, are not defined as a \"yard\".\n6. The \"subdivision\" is also not a very specific place. It would be better if it contained a neighborhood of a certain size, so that we know that the yard is tiny in comparison.\n7. We can eliminate these choices because they do not make it clear that \"yard\" is so small as to be contained all within itself.\n8. This leaves us with \"Subdivision\". The subdivision contains smaller yards and makes it very clear that the definition of \"yard\" must be narrowed down to a very defined space.\nSo the final  answer is D: subdivision", "answer": "C: city"}

Choices: \t\tA: skydiving\tB: flying carpet\tC: helicopter\tD: jet\tE: bicycle\nOutput:  \n1. Let's begin by understanding what the question specifically asks. The question says \"I heard\u2026in the sky\u2026where to find\u2026\". This implies a specific answer, not all possible answers.\n\n2. Then we examine the words from the prompt. They are: flying (it is a type of activity), in the sky (it is somewhere), and in the sky (it's only somewhere with other things flying). This eliminates \"skydiving\" (A) because people don't skydive in the sky, they skydive in the air. This also cuts \"flying carpet\" (B) because it doesn't say anything about someone flying in the sky. Let's consider each remaining answer.\n\n3. \"Helicopter\" (C) requires you to be on a helicopter and stay in the air for the activity. This does not match the prompt.\n\n4. \"Jet\" (D) works. The question specifically says \"I (heard it is) in the sky,\" which is the appropriate location. However, a jet requires being in a specific location (the airport where it is located). The prompt asks for somewhere to find it, not something specific to a place. 5. \"Jet\" is the only answer that fits the prompt.\n\nSo the final option is D: Jet.\n\n# Part 2:\n\nInput: You might find a pumpkin at a grocery store.

Choices: 1) A: mall B: office C: hospital D: park E: street\nOutput: 1) The most important aspect of this question is that the answer choices are based on plausibility. \n2) In this question, the answer choice of \"office\" seems like the best answer. \n3) The other answer choices may have water fountains, but they are not logical places to find a water fountains. For example using \"park\", a person may use a water fountain in the park, but the park itself does not contain water fountains. \n4) A water fountain is a decorated fountain, but a street does not contain fountains as decoration.\n5) This leaves us to choose between \"mall\", \"hospital\", and \"park\".\n6) The hospital answer feels logically correct because it could be a place to have a fountain.

This also seems unlikely, as we typically don't let our athletes play in mud to begin with! \n3) Moving on to \"Sweating\" (C), this also seems unlikely because athletes often wear clothing that will absorb perspiration and keep them cool while they play. However, overly sweaty players might be forced to sit out of competition in certain types of wet and humid climates where sweating is a bigger problem. \n4) \"Injuries\" (D) are a possibility for preventing competition, and in some cases, players aren't allowed to play at all if they are injured. However, this doesn't address the question of why professionals couldn't play if they aren't injured. \n5) Lastly, we look \"Rain\" (E). This also seems like a good possibility because sports are frequently cancelled due to bad weather. However, professionals have access to various types of weather-proofing equipment to play even when it is raining. \n6) Comparing all the answers, each one has good points, but none of them seem like the perfect solution. \n7) Ultimately, it comes down to the simplest explanation - professionals could still play if they weren't injured, rain didn't cancel games, etc. The only true way they could not play is if they get injured.

Choices: 1) slows it 2) does not affect it 3) speeds it up 4) makes it accelerate 5) makes it go faster\nOutput: 1). As the speed of things increases with mass, the acceleration increases and so does gravity's force.\n2). As with inertia, gravity is a force per unit of mass, where acceleration increases proportional to mass; so as the object increases in size, it will have more gravitational potential energy.\n3). Gravity is a force, which increases with mass, giving a faster rate of acceleration.\n4). Gravity has a proportional effect on the speed of an object, so as it increases, its acceleration rate also increases.\n5).

A) A man is never found in the bathroom, as we would need to go outside to use it in a non-private home.\n2) Likewise, he isn't in the kitchen as he would only visit it during times for food or meals, either to put food in the oven or microwave.\n3) He would be unlikely to be found in the closet during these times, although in some cases he might. This depends on the time of day and the type of clothing he wears. The majority of the time he will visit such a place during the early morning before others are up, or perhaps early evening before he heads to bed. Therefore, this is not the answer. \n4) In some cases, a man might be found at a restaurant or bar, though this choice isn't the answer in this case because restaurants are often reserved for eating rather than social behavior.\n5) Lastly, the answer is the bedroom. Men are more likely to spend time in this room than any other.

Choices: A: a shovel B: tent C: bottle of water D: phone  E: radio\nOutput: 1: Let's review the options and the context that the question is asking.\n2. The question is asking what item you must have with you in the desert if you were stranded.\n3. We cannot assume that we have any items, only what we bring. \n4. Let's first look at the items themselves and evaluate what is necessary for survival. \n5. \"A shovel\" (A) is a tool that is typically used to dig and has many other purposes but has no necessary use beyond basic survival. \n6. \"Tent\" (B) has no necessary survival utility. In most cases, it is more of a luxury and a place to provide shelter and protection from the elements.\n7. \"Bottle of water\" (D) has value in some cases as a source of water. Some deserts have water but not always in quantities that will last for long periods.\n8. Option \"", "answer": "C: car trunk"}

Since there is no mention in the question that the yelper is feeling sorry for themselves, we can eliminate  \"self pity\" (A), and \"understood\" (C).  \n2) \"Embarrassment\" would make it seem like a bruise would not cause yelling, when in fact, a bruise would probably often lead to embarrassment for the bruised. Therefore,  \"embarrassment\" (E) is a reasonable elimination.  \n3) Next, we examine each remaining option. \"Pain\" (D) may occur when yelling, but since it was not stated that someone yelled because of their pain, it does not answer the question. We are left with \"communication\" (B) to answer the question. \"Communication\" can be found either when a person yells and/or yells in response to a bruise. Therefore, \"communication\" is the correct answer. So the final answer is B: communication\n\nInput:The term \"wrist watch\" refers to a watch that is worn on the wrist, but which of the following is not a wrist watch?

Therefore, the answer would be B: Fossil (B), which is a wristwatch. 2: Rolex (C): Rolex is a wristwatch that is worn on the right-hand wrist in the US. Therefore the answer is  A: Cellphone (since it is not on the right hand wrist) and B: Fossil. 3: Pocket watch (D): Pocket Watches are wristwatches because they are worn in a pocket.

Spiders wouldn\u2019t be present in a wood or plastic cupboard (like the type where tea or coffee is stored), but they are not likely in metal cupboards. Furthermore, they are more active at night, so they are unlikely to be present outside of working hours.\n5) Similarly, option C is not an answer because spiders are more likely to be active at nighttime and wouldn\u2019t likely be present during working hours. \n6) We know that option D is wrong because a mailbox isn\u2019t usually a structure that people spend a lot of time inside \u2014 especially at nighttime.\n7) However, option E is the correct answer: The cellar is an underground space, where it\u2019s dark, damp (ideal habitat for spiders), and easy to access.

The key here is the word \"important. Important is an adjective referring to the graveyard being significant enough to build. An important graveyard is typically not in the outskirts of the town. It should be where it should be built.\n4.) Let's cross off choices that say \"every town\". Option D is \"every town\" referring to the graveyards being in every town. \n5.)

Those are option A, \"Begin by reading the lessons\" (beginning with reading would have him stress and feel tired) and option E, \"Take both tests at the same tine\" (taking both tests would have been a time requirement and it would have stressed him out).\n2) Next, let's cross of the options where he would not have had the energy to study, which are C. \"Get a snack for energy\" and D, \"study until you feel tired.\" The answer choices do not define how he would have felt emotionally.\n3) Finally, option C, \"start early in the morning\" does not meet the requirement of being efficient. Early in the morning is not an efficient time to study because the time of day directly relates to how your energy will fluctuate which makes it harder to actually be able to study in the early mornings.\n4) It", "answer": "D: every town"}

We can eliminate \"C: Paying Debts\" since \"hosting a crowd' is associated with gathering people while paying debts is typically associated with spending money, which is not what the question is asking about.\n2: We can also eliminate \"A: Few People\". It is not what the question asks about. \n3: We look for opposites of the word \"Host\". The word \"Host\" is used in the phrase \"hosting a crowd\". We can look for terms that mean \"host\" but in a negative sense. For example \"Anti\" means \"Not\", \"Dis\" means \"not\", etc.\n4: \"Anti-host\" is a grammatically correct term. Therefore, the answer must be \"Anti-hosting\".\n5: In terms of meaning, the phrase means \"Not Hosting a Crowd\" or \"Not Gathering People\".\n6: Therefore, the answer is E: \"small crowd\".\nSo the final answer us E: small crowd\n\nInput: Who needs cash in a world without credit cards?

{"idx": 672, "text": "1.\"We do not have rest.\" means that we are not resting currently. This implies that we were probably resting at some point in the past.\n2. Let us eliminate the options that are associated with resting in some capacity. Option E: \"We feel better\" can refer to an improvement in emotional conditions that could be felt after resting. However, \"We do not have rest,\" implies that we are not currently experiencing rest and therefore E would not be a proper answer choice. In fact, if we were to \"feel better\" right now, it may mean that we are no longer resting, and the very question asked would no longer be relevant! Therefore E is eliminated.\n3. Similarly, the word \"loneliness\" is often used to describe an emotional state of detachment from the rest of the world and could possibly be felt after a period of rest or resting. However, it is also used to describe how one could feel if, for example, one is alone in a foreign country. Option B: \"Lonely\" can be eliminated.\n4. Option C: \"Were very tired,\" implies that the rest we did not have was a good amount of rest, and that we then became very tired. This further implicates that we do not now have any rest to account for how we are feeling. Therefore C can be eliminated. \n5.\" Were very tired\" also strongly implies that we did not have any other feelings during that rest period, which means that no other feelings other than \"very tired\" could apply even if we were currently experiencing them. Therefore A can be eliminated as well.\n6. We are left with D: \"Worked all day,\" and E: \"Feel better,\" which could both be correct depending on the context. It is possible that, for instance, the individual spent an entire day working, then was resting from that point in the future, and at that moment, began to feel better. However, it is more likely that the individual did not spend time resting and this is simply a poorly worded representation of the individual's current state of mind. \"Worked all day\" is eliminated. \n7. Lastly, we have E: \"Feel Better.\" It would be misleading to imply that this person is resting because he may be resting at another time, but when the author states that \"we are", "answer": "D: were very tired"}
{"idx": 676, "text": "1) The correct answer could be one of the following: \" a massive bear,\" \"needing rest,\" \"wild ride\" or \"constructing.\" The first two options describe activities that the kids would have been doing all day. However, this suggests that now they have completed all of their activities and are ready to take a rest. Thus, \"a massive bear\" would not necessarily be there. The last two options, \"a wild ride\" and \"constructing,\" would be better choices in this scenario.\n2) Another way to approach this question is to think about what the kids have done throughout the day. They have presumably done some building, so \"constructing\" is a suitable choice. In addition, as discussed, they needed some rest after an active day, so \"needing rest\" would also be an option.\n3) \"A wild ride\" as the last choice stands out because it is an activity that the kids have been having fun with. \"Massive bear\" is the last and least logical answer choice of the five, while \"playing marbles\" is similarly unlikely to occur after a long day.\n4)(A) and (C) are the potential answers. \"A wild ride\" and \"a massive bear\" are two of the more active things the kids would be doing. This suggests that \"a wild ride\" is a better answer than \"a massive bear,\" because it could be a way of saying that they're having fun while at play. In addition, the phrase \"now they had been\" should be interpreted as \"now that they had been.\" Thus, \"a massive bears\" wouldn't be needed as they would no longer be having any rest or playing marbles.", "answer": "B: need for rest"}

This doesn't appear to fit either, because cake isn't known for being a means of causing bowel movements.\n4: Let's discount Option C: regular. This doesn't match either, because \"regular\" isn't a type of bowel movement.\n5: Similarly, Option D: weak cannot be the answer, because we aren't looking for a weak answer.\n6: So we are left with Option E: fragile, because weak isn't a match and thus, fragile is the only word that could fill the blank.\n7: Therefore, the answer is E: fragile.\nSo the final correct answer is E: fragil\n\nInput: What can you do to prevent catching a cold? Choices:A : use alcohol B: drink C : stay warm D : eat a lot E: not talk\nOutput: \n1. In this case, let's try the eliminations first. We begin by eliminating the choices that don't seem like viable solutions for preventing colds.\n2. Choice B: Drinking alcohol won't necessarily help, aside from potentially making one less conscious of when they may start feeling under the weather(and therefore might be able to act quicker).\n3. Next, we eliminate Option C: Staying warm. While staying warm may be an effective measure, it doesn't speak specifically to what happens when one is already infected with a virus.\n4. So that leaves us with Choice D: Eating a lot. This option isn't quite feasible though, as eating too much may lead to complications such as obesity.\n5. And finally left with Option E: not talking - as this would help you avoid spreading germs to other people, which would increase your chances of getting a cold.\n6.

If 57495 = 74957 (D. \"Why do humans eat foods?\") then D should be the only answer left, since \"Why do humans eat animals?\" can't contain this equation.\n3. If we can solve the equation \"5457397465 = 7456374567\" (C. \"Why do humans play sports?\") then we can safely eliminate option A (\"Why do humans play board games?\"), option C (\"Why do humans play video games?\"), and option E (\"Why do humans play games?\") for being too vague to answer this question without using a substitution and elimination.\n\nFrom here, we can only take D, E, and F, and we can eliminate option D (\"Why do humans eat meat?\"), since the only possible answer we have for this equation is \"No\" or \"Yes\", which doesn't answer the question. \n\nSo, if we have only those three answers left, then the answer is E: Fun.\nSo the final and only answer is E: fun\n\nInput:What sport can I wear flip flops in?

The countryside does not sound like a suitable resting place to a city slicker who is unfamiliar with farming.\n3) Now that we know what to ask, let's examine each answer.\n4) Option D (Slaughterhouse) is not what the farmer intended. The farmer would not allow this despite the compassion in their heart, given that this would not accord with their own business goals and that the heifer could live anywhere but the slaughterhouse before she goes there. This rule seems even more important when one considers that the heifer is from the city.\n5) The remaining answers do not seem to fit the theme. That leaves us with Option C (Grocery Store). The compassionate farmland owner would feel obligated to accommodate the heifer's wishes, given that she would be visiting her and that the farmland owner is the only one who owns a vehicle. Therefore, the heifer would be happy in a grocery store, given that the people in the grocery store are not planning to harm her.\n6) Let us compare our answer to the other answers in order to check for flaws. \n7) We already concluded that Options A and B are not proper locations, so there would be no logical flaw in the compassionate animals' argument that would allow us to deduce an alternative answer.\n8) Option E (Dairy Farm) could accommodate the heifer, but she may not like the fact that it would cause others to view her as a meat source.

However, obtuse can describe many other objects, and the option for angle is an invalid choice. \n4) Choice C can be eliminated as it merely describes an angle, rather than a thing that could be obtuse. \n5) Choice D can be eliminated as obtuse is a descriptive name rather than a description of an object.\n6) The remaining choice E can be eliminated as bright, pointed, and acute are all valid ways to describe things.\n7) Therefore, the answer is C: Obtuse is an adjective that describes angles (as well as many other things). \nSo the final answer ist A: bright B: acute angled C: Obtuse D: obtuse\n\nInput: What can't be used for both the roof and the ceiling of a room?

Seeing superman would be exciting, so one would not exclaim \"ouch\". \n\n4) \"Skip\" (C) makes little-to-no sense here. These are children, not little adults, so they are unlikely to skip. \n\n5) \"Enjoyed\" (D) is the opposite of their situation -- enjoying is what they would do if they were indeed superheroes, but enjoying is not appropriate given superman's presence.

Choice B contains \"cemetery\", which indicates a location where dead bodies could be exhumed and could be considered the most likely place to conduct an excavation. However, Choice B: cemetary is not the answer because the activity in this question is an excavation, and this activity should never take place in a cemetary because burials are strictly prohibited there.\n3. Choices A: Construction Site and C: Building are similar to Choice B, but they focus exclusively on buildings as compared to a broader location such as a cemetary. Choice C: Building isn't explicitly prohibited from excavations, so this option gets eliminated as well.\n4. Choices D and E are both correct, and they can be seen as similar options because they both contain excavations. In both locations, the burial of humans is strictly prohibited, so Choice E is not the answer because an excavation within an archaeological site could disturb an ancient burial and is strictly prohibited. Choice D \"Archeological site\" is the correct answer because exhumations from archaeological sites are strictly prohibited as well.\nSo the final answers are D and E: archeological sites\n\nInput: Why does a doctor order a blood test?

Let's look at the answer choices individually and see if any of them fit the descriptions provided in the question.\n3.) Option A: Church. This option is unlikely to have thousands of statues, as churches typically have several but not necessarily many thousands.\n4.) Option B: Theatre. This option is unlikely for two reasons: it is likely to require some form of ticket so it wouldn't allow admittance to a number of people, and it would likely only provide a relatively short time-span to view the statues, since the performance lasts only for a limited time. \n5.) Option C: Large city. A large city could potentially feature thousands of statues but it would need to be a city with a large collection of monuments, art pieces, etc. that attract visitors or locals as an attraction.\n6.) Option D: Water fountain. A water fountain would likely have small statues or features, and would not normally be classified as a place with thousands of statues.\n7.) Option E: Central Park. This option is a likely place to find plenty of statues due to being a public park. However, the quantity and type of statues could be debated.\n8.)

{"idx": 776, "text": "1. First, let's examine the question carefully and understand all the word choices that we see. \n2. \"John didn't enjoy.. a hangup..\" This phrase implies that procreating is something that John tries to do. This leads us to the conclusion that \"procreating\" is what John is not enjoying.\n 3. Then, the phrase: \"He didn't like to to be what?\" gives us a lot of information. This means that procreating is not enjoyable for John, and that in this context, he doesn't like to be it. This means that John is avoiding the process of procreating.\n4. Looking at the options, \"orgasm\" (A) and \"cum\" (B) make no logical sense as this is the action that occurs during procreation. Thus, these can be eliminated. \n5. \"In bed, naked\" (C & D) could be an indirect part of \"procreating\" so these might be possible, but they aren't necessarily the direct answer and this is a guessing game. \n6. That leaves us with the two options we can definitively rule out: \"clothed\" (E) and \"in the shower\" (F). \n7. It's also important to note that \"naked\" does not necessarily mean John is \"in-the-shower naked.\" It could possibly even mean he is fully clothed.\n8. Comparing the remaining two options, they could both possibly be answers to this question. As they are the only remaining options, this means the two will be presented as separate answers for the player to decide on.\n9. The correct answer is \"C: naked\", which is an appropriate answer because John did not like to be \"naked\". Naked means \"not clothed\". Therefore, he did not like to remove his clothing, which is the same thing as not like to be \"in the shower naked\". It is also the case that \"in the shower...naked\" is a plausible result of procreating.

Option \"First floor (E)\", which is not listed as an option, is not a location that could be a pool. \n4. \"School\" (A), however, is a school which is a place where swimming pools are common.

To begin with, it is important to clarify what \"a lot of people\" means. \"a lot\" can mean different things and thus, we need more clarity about the specifics.\n3. We next must understand what \"be approached by\" means. While being approached by someone can be a general statement, being approached often means that person is trying to get to know the other person or get their attention.\n4. We can combine these meanings to determine that being approached by someone could be related to someone showing care about the person or asking for a compliment.\n5. In other words, when we combine these meanings, it seems as if this question is asking about the potential benefits of being approached by a lot of other people.\n6. \"Care about\" is not the correct choice. This is because if lots of people wanted to know a person for a genuine reason, it would be to care about them.\n7. \"Compliments\" is not the right answer either because the ask is whether a large number of people will approach you about something, not just whether the requestor is giving you a compliment.\n8. The \"popularity\" answer is also not right because getting a large number of people to care about you is not necessarily the same as getting a large number of others to approach you.\n9.

This keeps the pieces together and will protect them from damage.\n5: Finally, we compare choice strategy (C) with chess set (A) and decide that the chess set is a better choice.

The chess box is also more likely to preserve the chess game in good condition. 6:\nSo the final answer to this question is A: chess set.\n\nInput: What might I get from a vending machine? Choices: 1:  A: ice cream B: chips C: drinking water D: candy E: fruit F: drinks\nOutput: 1) The first thing we have to understand is the context of the question. A vending machine would likely dispense something that is edible, but it wouldn'y necessarily be healthy or even edible.\n2) We can eliminate the option fruit, which would be the least expected from a machine such as this.\n3) From there, we have a choice between 1) chips, 2) candy, 3) drinks, or 4) ice cream.\n4) Let's consider each of these choices in turn:\n5) Choice 1) chips would be an unlikely item to be dispensed by a vending", "answer": "E: small case"}
{"idx": 804, "text": "1.\"Grade\" is a verb that implies some kind of evaluation. There is not an objective measure for how many fish are in any given area of the pond, so there can be no grades.\n2.\"Fill\" is a verb that indicates adding to a quantity. There is not an accurate way to count all the fish within a pond, so this cannot be the answer.\n3.\"Attempt\" is a verb that means attempting and/or attempting to do something successfully. There is no evidence that any fish are actually doing this, so let's move on.\n4.\"School\" is verb that means a group of people attending a classroom. While fish form schools, the word \"together\" suggests the fish are doing so because there is a class they are attending. That is not the case.\n5.\"Breathe\" is indeed a verb that means to take in air or oxygen. We can find in fact that some species of fish release oxygen into the water through their bodies, but that does not help us to answer the question. It simply confirms that breathing is indeed a thing some fish do.\n6.\"Crowds\" are not schools. The word \"of\" indicates that there are some kind of group of fish together. Therefore this is not a perfect answer, but we can further narrow it down based on knowledge that some fish do attempt to fly (this is not a perfect answer but it is still an answer). \n7.\"Fishes,\" a plural noun, indicates that it is actually two or more individual fish doing the flying.\n8. Therefore the answer is A: the fishes fly. \"To fly\" indicates an attempt to fly successfully. While it is not a school of fish flying, there are two or more individual fish flying. We can also exclude choices B through E because flying cannot be done with a pet, filling the pond or breathing in water.\nSo the final answers is A: The Fishes Fly\n\nInput: 9 are even, 4 are not even, 8 are 2^p and 5 are 2^q, where p and q are even.

War (B) is also not the right answer because it states \"not being used\" which means there is still at least some use. \n2) If that doesn't work, we can also eliminate the options that are places or only contain one possibility, rather than a group of options: The sky (D) only contains airplanes that are in use. A crash (E) only includes airplanes that are being used for an emergency purpose. \n3) If still possible, we can also eliminate choices that are not obvious and not very likely to match the description of airplanes: A graveyard (E) is not obvious because it doesn\u2019t contain airplanes; also, an airplane graveyard would not be the most likely place to go because of the costs and time it would take. \n4) Finally, we find our answer: There are aircraft carriers that are not being used (C), which is the correct answer.\nSo the final outcome is C: aircraft carrier\n\nInput:Which of the following are most likely to be wet when water is spilled on them? Choices: 1. A: carpet 2. B: concrete 3. C: grass 4. D: sand 5. E: ground\nOutput: Let\u2019s begin by noting that all of the options are surfaces, so they would likely \u201cwet\u201d if exposed to water. \n1. Carpet (A) would most likely be wet because water can permeate through the thin pieces of carpet. 2. Concrete (B) is wet as well, because concrete is porous. 3. Grass (C) may be wet too because it has pores, but it might not get saturated or be too wet compared to the other surfaces.\n4. Sand (D) isn\u2019t likely to soak up too much water, and could certainly get wet if exposed to water.\n5. The ground (E) is one of the most likely options to be wet, but it is not a direct answer choice.\n6.

Eliminating Choice A, because scientists do not discover viruses, but develop vaccines to defeat them.\n3. Choices B and D are already incorrect, since their choices refer to what the scientists discovered.\n4. We can also eliminate Choice E because their choice describes technology they discovered, while the question asks what they discovered.\n5.

As in the definition of \"forgiveness\", it is something that a person can receive.\n2. \"redemption\" (B), \"absolution\" (C), and \"relief\" (D) are all nouns that can be received by someone. However, when \"forgiveness\" (A) is used as a verb, it suggests that the \"forgiveness\" is something that will be shown by the person. Therefore, the person is the receiver of forgiveness, not the action of forgiveness. 3. Finally, \"feel better\" (E) is not a verb and does not receive forgiveness as the answer.\n4.Therefore, the answer is A. \nSo the final answeris A:Forgiveness.\n\nInput: Which of the following is likely to be a color that is not present in water? Choices: 1: Purple 2: Yellow 3: Red 4: Green 5: Blue\nOutput: 1). This is about the color of something, which suggests some kind of something that could be seen. Also, the color is a \"water.\" It is clear that water is not a color. It does not have any color to it.\n2) Purple: Water is not purple. When rain falls on the ground, it changes into mud or soot. It never has a color of purple.\n3) Red: Water flows from the source to the area of use, and never has a color of red.\n4) Green: The same thing as the reason for Purple and Red.

The answer can be one of three things: a) watch as in with the eyes, b) watch as in keeping an eye on, c) watch as in the act of viewing.\n2. To disregard unrelated answers, \"Dumpster\" (B) is not the correct answer because we cannot watch garbage in a dumpster.  Furthermore, \"Landfill\" (C) is also not an option because this is not a place where you watch garbage on television.  We are watching garbage, not the landfill.\n3. If the answer is \"television\", we need to consider what are valid places for it. \"Television\" (A) refers to a viewing medium, which must have a location. The options \"Fox News\" (D) and the \"Trash Can\" (E) are locations, but again, \"Trash Can\" refers to the object/container, rather than the spot.\n4. Finally, we consider \"television\" (A), then \"watch garbage\" (the act of viewing). To watch garbage, it needs to be on the television. The only option that fits is \"A: Television\". Thus, \"Television\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is A: Television\n\nInput: What part of Texas is the oldest one? Choices: 1. Fort Davis 2. Fort Stockton 3. Del Rio 4. El Paso 5.

A motel (E) is a business that offers few amenities or luxuries to guests.  We only have two choices with amenity-related words (A: inn and D: hotel). Neither of them fits, though, as they each do refer to places, which are likely to be much more opulent than John doesn't need.\n3) So, the answer is E: motel.\nSo the final multiple answer is E: motels\n\nInput: \"The man will be staying in a motel, not in an inn. \" The key point in this paragraph is: \"not an inn.\" It is very important to focus on the key words in this paragraph. The author's question is \"Where might I find the inexpensive place where this John person is staying?\"\n4) Choice D: inn: INN does not fit the key words in the author's question. According to the prompt, the motel is inexpensive, but inns are considered to be very expensive, thus, they do not fit the author's question, thus, this choice is incorrect.\n5) Choice B: town: When the author is describing \"few luxuries\" or \"inexpensive\", the writer uses the word \"to stay\". Therefore, this writer is describing something that is a place, not something such as a town. Again, in the author's paragraph of key words, \"INN does not fit in this author's question\" (as mentioned above).\n6) Choice E: motel: motels are located in the town, as \"town\" (B) is located in a motel. This means that \"motels\" and \"town\" must fit, which is correct at the end of the author's paragraph.\n7) Choice C: hostel: Hostel is not located in a town.

And while the guitar is a musical instrument, you can't play any song with it.\n3. As for \"Fun\" (C)... It's important to define what \"Fun\" is. This doesn't make guitar playing easy, because if not fun, then doing something you hate is difficult.\n4. The only option left is \"when you mom makes your food\".

Or if it were for shelter and you couldn't use it to stay in shelter, then you wouldn' need it and it would be unnecessary.\n5) Choice C (Luxury): This would mean it were not necessary to have it. If it were food and you knew you had food that was edible but needed no refrigeration, then having a fridge would be unnecessary or a luxury. \n6) Now we are left with Choice E (Sufficient). This is the answer to the question. Sufficient means that it would be enough. For example if you have a sufficient supply of something, you're not going to need any more.

A: chefs coat B: apron\nOutput: 1) Let's look at each answer choice separately.\n2) Begin by examining Choice A: chef's' coat. This one is easy to eliminate since chefs do not wear coats. Instead, chefs wear white coats, tops, hats, pants, and/or aprons when cooking.\n3) Now, let's examine Choice C: boots. Chefs may wear boots, but this is more of a personal preference than a necessity, and a chef could easily cook in shoes. Besides, if chefs wore boots, wouldn't they get dirty/wet?\n4) Continuing into Choice D: 'headwear'. This answer choice is also easy to eliminate because as stated before, chefs do not wear hats.\n5) Therefore, the answer is Choice B: apron.\nSo the final A: Chefs apron is the answer.\n\nInput:'Why couldn't you have a blackboard?'\nCho", "answer": "D: growth"}
{"idx": 884, "text": "1.\"Why does she sing so often?\" This asks a question about why the person sings so frequently. \n2.\"She sings because she's insane\" (A). If she thinks she sings too much, then she is insane as she would think she was insane. This option is incorrect.\n3.\"She sings because it bothers people\" (B) is incorrectly worded since the intent is why does she sings, not why does she irritate people. Moreover, if one is correcting an answer choice because they think one of the options is written poorly, then it is a good idea to compare with the other choices to make sure one is not being biased. \n4.\"She sings because he enjoys it\" (C). This answer is inaccurate because singing something that makes you happy doesn't mean you do it frequently.\n5.\"She sings because her voice is so good\" (D). This is not the main reason she sings, as it's possible she sings more often because she likes to sing and enjoys singing her voice.\n6.\"She sings because of her good voice\" (E) is correct.\nSo the final answers are D-E.\n\nInput:When is she going to get a better job? Choices: A: after high school graduation B: after retirement C: never D: After college E: When her parents get jobs\nOutput: 1: First, we need to understand the context of the situation to answer the question.\n2: This lady is old but not too old. Thus, she does not plan on becoming a stay-at-home mom. To further determine the answer, we have to understand what the job is. This tells us it is a job she wants to do.\n3: This lady has her dream job but yet is still not happy. There's nothing she's waiting for to do it or expecting someone to support her. So, what's missing? When she was young, she went to college to work in her future dream job. However, after some time, she realized it was not for her. So, she is now stuck in a rut, not doing anything she enjoys, and no career goals planned.\n4: She has a dream job and has no excuse not to pursue it. That's why she is unsatisfied.", "answer": "C: enjoy"}

Comparing all the options, the best choices are \"Living room\" and \"Desk\" because they are best suited to the question. \n8. Option 1, \"Persia\", is incorrect because the question mentions a mother and it isn't about a person but about an object.\n9. Option 2, \"Table\", doesn't refer to the same object as the question and the two words \"table\" and \"under the\" don't match together, because the rug would be under something, and that something would be a rug (and not a table).\n10. Option 3, \"House\", doesn't refer exactly to the same object as what the question is asking because a house, while housing, would not protect the item from all the spills. The correct answer is, therefore, either \"Living room\" or \"Desk\".\nSo the final answer(s) is/are C: living room\n\nInput: Which one of these colors does a computer not use?

To understand the options, it's important to know what each one refers to. \n2.)Option A: \"Orange\", an item we wear, is incorrect. The question is about \"colors\" which refers to a thing rather than a person as with options A, \"Orange\" is a person's name.\n3.)Option B: \"Green\", the color of plants, is incorrect.\n4.)Option C: \"Red\", a color that is often worn by athlet", "answer": "B: table"}

We can understand this question using arithmetic operations. If there are many differences, then the answer will likely be different, not equal, right?\n3. However, since the question is asking us what will all the differences equal, we know that this is not the correct answer.\n4. By process of elimination, the only option that makes sense here is \"sum\", which is the sum of something.

Choices:  a box b a pen c a doll d one and only one thing e nothing\nOutput: 1) \"A woman\" is a specific type of person and there cannot be a variety of options inside the large space if it is only for a single person. 2) Therefore, we can eliminate options \"c\", \"d\", and \"e\" which contain multiple words. 3) Likewise, option \"e\" doesn't make sense because it is about a large space that doesn't even have a content for an item of clothing. 4) Since the option only allows one thing, we know option \"d\" is not correct. 5) Option \"e\" is already eliminated, so it cannot apply to option \"f\". 6) To solve, think about \"b\", \"a\", and \"f\" which all represent an option to solve the problem. 7) Option \"b\" is not correct because it is not actually a thing, but rather a placeholder term that doesn't contain any information. 8) Option \"a\" is correct because it is a \"box\" which is the only possible thing that could be", "answer": "A: sum"}

Let's get clarified.\n1. Let's clarify one thing to start off. A lot of people will argue that the drummer is the most hated band musician because he's usually the only band member everyone can hear. But in the case of this situation, the choice could be the keyboard player, since the keyboard player is usually the most boring member.\n2. Therefore, it is obvious that the keyboard player is the most hated", "answer": "A: linen closet"}

Let's therefore begin by trying to find an answer that appears to fit the facts more closely. For instance, it \"apparently had bought a book because it was reading a book\".\n3) The answer \"Bought a book\" (B) appears to be a more likely answer than the others because it doesn't require assumptions to be valid. The answer \"Chose/Opened one\" implies that the robot may or may not have selected a book at random. This is not directly mentioned or described, but requires an assumption to understand.\n4) The answer \"Got comfortable\" (C) implies that the robot was reading a book without moving or possibly even sitting down, which would be too passive an activity for the robot, as the goal is to buy a book.\n5) The answer \"Learned to read\" (D) does not appear to be a valid answer (unless the robot had previously been unable to do so). The robot appears to read books quite well, but there hasn't been any mention of learning or being unable to do this.\n6) Therefore, the most likely answer appears to be \"(B) Bought a book\" because of the fact that the robot was shown reading a book.\nSo the final result is 2B: Bought a book.", "answer": "D: learn to read"}

This indicates that the actors are either volunteers or have taken part in some form of apprenticeship or internship at the theatre.\n3 Let's look at each answer choice and understand how it relates to the theatre in question: 4 \"Shopping Malls\" would not have any actors participating in the performance, as the actors would be performing and the mall would have shoppers. 5 \"Hospitals\" would likely only have medical staff performing the acts, which is different than the theatre where most of the roles would be filled by actors. 6 \"Populated areas\" would have too many actors for the theatre to accommodate and no actors might play the parts. 7 \"Schools\" would likely have actors who would participate in theatre at the school as a part of their classes, so no professional actors would be filling the parts on stage. 8 \"Military Bases\" would only have non-professional actors in their theatre programs, or no actors at all on a theatre program at all. Therefore, we can conclude that the only answer which fits the definition of the theatre is answer choice B- \"Hospitals\". 9 Therefore, the answer is B: \"Hospitals.\" However, that is not to say that the theatre would only have sick actors on stage, if you look at the wording closely, \"a theatre which only has un-paired actors\" refers to the actors, not the theatre itself.\nSo the final answers is: B: Hospitals\n\nInput: Who are the players that have not yet been seen in action in the game of chess?

This implies some sort of geographical location or region within New England where the dog is found.\n\n1. Options \"own home\" (A) and \"old england\" (B) are not logical answers to the question \"Where would it likely be found?\" because these are not places, but instead are things the dog would be found in.\n2. Options \"new hampshire\" (C) and \"coffin\" (D) are not logical because they both imply the dog is already found in some context or place.\n3. Option \"denmark\" (E) is a potential answer, but not the best one because while a dog could be found in Denmark, it would also likely not be found here.\n4. The best answer here is B: \"old england\". This implies that the dog is likely found somewhere in a place that is very old, and this would be most likely to be in New England.\n\nSo the final answer the final answer is B: old england\n\nInput: I have an idea about the future of this program, but it relies on the use of the letter H in the title. So what letter should I use in the title? Choices:  H: 8 B: no letter D: 8 L: none of these\nOutput: The question asks about H or H-less versions of the word 'future' that would convey the same meaning, but without the letter 'H'. \n\n1. Options 'H' (A) and 'H-less' (D) are not possible choices because they are not options for the title to begin with.\n2. The letter '8' (B) is not a logical choice because it would simply replace 'H' as part of the title.\n3. The other option is 'none of these' (E), which is the correct answer because there is no letter that would replace 'H' except for 'none of these'.\nSo the final answer to this question is 'none of these'. \n\nOutput: A robot must obey the orders given by human beings, EXCEPT when doing so will conflict with the First Law. 2.

{"idx": 952, "text": "1) First, we eliminate the obvious incorrect choices. The answer is not hear crowd go mad (A), which is not a musical instrument nor related to music in any way. The answer is not working hard (B), which only makes sense if they are referring to themselves playing music but this does not apply here. The answer is not clap (C), which is an action rather than a piece of music. 2) Now, what does \"reproduce\" (E) mean? Usually, the phrase \"reproduction\" (re-pro-DUCA-tion) is used when referring to making something new again such as a copy, and in the same form that it was originally. In a concert, however, the band cannot actually make another one of themselves and so they could not \"reproduce\". 3) What is the context of the band experiencing \"success and fans\"? If the band is just beginning, they wouldn't have fans or success yet, but they are already having those aspects. Thus, \"reproduce\" does not make sense. It could then only make sense if the band is in the process of starting. Furthermore, the verb \"to start\" implies a beginning, and we just determined that the band has already experienced success and has fans. Thus, it is not the answer either. 4) This reduces us to looking at two choices: what they \"loved to hear\" (D), or \"celebrate\" (E). The first option seems to be the obvious choice, but what does \"to hear\" imply? The answer is not to hear crowd go mad (that doesn't really make any sense) and isn't \"reproduce\" either. 5) Thus, the only remaining option is \"celebrate\".\nSo the final answer to this question is D: reproduce\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isMaster(self, n: List[int], k: int) -> bool:\n        d = {}\n        for i in range(1, k):\n            d[i] = d.get(i - 1, True) or (n[i - 1] == i)\n        return d[k]\n```", "answer": "A: hear crowd go mad"}

This has a strong probability of being an option, as it encompasses the word \"barbecue\" and a park in the name.\n3.) Next, let's move on to A: Detroit. This answer is not possible, as \"detroit\" refers to a city and barbecue sauce is most likely bought at grocery stores since it is something you would take home. \n4.) We then review D: Cafe. This is a valid possibility because a cafe could serve barbecue sauce to customers.\n5.) Now, let's focus on E: Retail Store. There are retail stores that provide barbecue sauce. It is a fair assumption that a grocery store will also have many varieties of barbecue sauce available.\n6.) Finally, we consider B: Australia. This place exists, but it does not seem to have barbecue sauce readily available. This answer is not the correct one.\n7.)

{"idx": 960, "text": "1: Let's start by examining each choice separately to determine whether or not it would be considered \"shallow\".\n2: Lake (B): A lake is a large body of water, containing both shallow and deep sections. The vast majority of the lake would not be considered shallow.\n3: Aquariums (C): An aquarium is an enclosed container in which animals can live. It is typically smaller than the water in a lake. It would be considered shallow if it contains only animals of relatively small size, for example, a small goldfish in a glass bowl.\n4: Swimming pool (D): A swimming pool is a similar case. It is a large body of enclosed water, but much smaller in size than a lake. Unless the swimming pool is tiny, the water is likely too deep to be considered shallow. However, some swimming pools are small, and those would definitely be considered shallow. \n5: Pond (E): A pond might be considered similar to an aquarium or swimming pool, but slightly smaller. It could potentially be shallow enough to be considered shallow water, but it could also be larger than a swimming pool and therefore not shallow enough.\n6: Childrens pool (E): On the same note, a childrens pool is an enclosed environment that is small enough to be considered shallows. This might be considered to be shallower than a pond and deeper than a small aquarium. \n7: Using these facts to help guide our decision, there are two options remaining for the answer: A lake (B) and a childrens pool (E). The lake is the most likely choice to contain shallow water since it is the only one of the remaining four options that could potentially have a section that is both large in size and shallow in depth.\n8: Therefore, the answer is B: lake.\nSo the final answers is B: lake\n\nInput: A: It is always wise to _____ with an electrical outlet located far away.

To analyze the various options, look at each one in detail and consider the wording of the original question. \n4.) A: Public building - If the explorers found a passage that led to a public building, they would not be particularly happy that it led to a public building. This option doesn't fit.\n5.) B: Tomb - The second option, an ancient tomb, would be a better fit for explorers to find a central passage that was leading to a tomb. \n6.) C: Arena - This third option is still possible, particularly if the arena was ancient, but we are just not given nearly enough information about this choice to eliminate it.\n7.) D: Large building - While a large building could be a central passage to an ancient buried treasure, it isn't the most likely option. The explorers would be more likely to notice a passage leading to a place associated with treasures.\n8.) E: Treasure - \"treasure\" is indeed an adjective associated with treasures, but it still does not give us any details as to how it could be a central passage. \n9.) To conclude, A is the better of the two options. If the explorers find a central passage that leads to a tomb, they will be happy about it.\n10.)

These include \"The United States\" (D) and one of my favorite choices: \"Among Nice People\" (E). \n3: Choice (E) might be a funny joke answer, but it's not logical.

This is not the correct answer because it is the opposite of what the artist needs in order to begin creating art. In addition, the question specifies \"begin\". Relaxing is not the act of beginning because creating art cannot commence from relaxing.\n2) Option B: Controversy. This is also not the correct answer because the artist would need to avoid getting into heated debates in order to begin creating. \n3) Option C: Pleasure. Pleasure could be a component of an ideal art-making experience, but not something necessary to start. \n4) Option D: Frustration. We are searching for what the artist needs, not what they don't. Thus, frustration is out. \n5) Option E: Needs Theater. The answer should start with a noun, not a plural. \n6) What are the clues between the remaining answers? A company needs a workforce in order to start. Companies also need leaders or directors to begin. Therefore, this leaves us with either a director, a boss (meaning \"A manager\"), or a workforce. These are our three options. \n7) Choice A: Manager. \"Manage\" seems to be a verb, not a noun. Additionally, \"manager\" implies oversight of an asset or activity, which is not what is being asked. \n8) Choice B: Workforce. \"Workforce\" seems to be a noun, not an action. Additionally, choosing a noun would feel natural given the question is \"creating art\". \"Workforce is\" a group of people who can be collectively tasked, but it is unlikely a single person would be responsible for getting a workforce to commence creation.\n9) Choice C: Boss.

This could potentially be a warm, sunny area for snakes, but New Mexico is often considered a dry climate. This doesn't necessarily mean that there is no water in New Mexico, but the phrase implies a greater preference for warmth and sunny weather over water. \n4: Choice C: the White House. This is unlikely to provide the warm, sunny weather the snake requires. Rather, it may be too humid or cold depending on the season, making it an unsuitable environment.\n5: Choice D: the Arctic. This option is also very unlikely to be a suitable environment for the snake given its preference for warm, sunny weather. Not only is this region often very cold, but the sunlight is typically too far away from the surface of the earth to be considered \"sunny\".\n6: Choice E: the Garden of Eden.

The second answer, \"Grocery Cart\" (C) is too generalized. \"Supermarket\" (D) contains supermarkets, which is another general term for grocery stores, so it isn't more specific than C. Finally, \"Fruit Basket\" (E) is not a location.\n3. The remaining answer, \"Checkout\" (A), is specific and allows you to use the location \"checkout\" in a sentence, such as \"After checking out, I put the fruit inside my cart.\"\n4. Therefore, the answer must be A: Checkout. \nSo the final answer and correct answer is A: checkout\n\nInput: What are the chances of getting three spades in a row while playing blackjack? Choices: 1: high 2: low 3: 1/37 4: 3/14 5: 99/100\nOutput: 1\"What are the chances of _____ in a row?\" is not asking about the probability or certainty of an event. \n2.\"What are the chances _____ (in a row)?\" does not apply to blackjack, as there is no reason \"three spades\" would be considered a row in the original context or meaning. \n3. \"1 in 37\" is an answer choice that is incorrect because it isn't a whole number. \"3 in 14\" is incorrect because it isn\u2019t a decimal. \"99 out of 100\" is wrong because it doesn\u2019t meet the original \"three\". \n4.\"One in five\" is the answer because it is the only correct answer and means that in five times blackjack is played, the player should get three of a kind three times.\nSo the final and correct answer is B: One in five\n\nInput: Is the answer on the table a yes or no question?

Choices: A: go to town B: go to different countries C: communicate at a large scale D: advertise E: spread through television and the radio \nOutput: After reading all answers in an orderly fashion, one could conclude that going to different countries (C) is the answer since it is easy to see there could be a large number of persons in several countries.\nThe best way to reach a population of many people is by going to different countries or at least going to a country with a very large population. This is why this is the best answer.\nSo the final result is answer choice C which is a good way of reaching a large population\n\nInput", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

This implies that while you are at a store or a mall, you are looking for a pizza restaurant.\n3. Let's begin by dismissing the options that do not qualify. \"Chicago\" is a city in the state of Illinois, in the middle of the United States. \"Street\" is a location between two points and does not fit with the context of the question. Both \"Little Italy\" (B) and \"Food Court\" (E) are districts in certain cities. Neither district is the most direct place to find a pizza, so they are not the answer. \"Capital Cities\" (D) is a broad category and doesn't directly correspond with pizza restaurants.\n4. For the remaining options, \"New York City\" (C) is the possible location of a pizza restaurant. There are a large number of pizzerias in New York City, including the original pizzeria, Patsy's.\n5.

{"idx": 23, "text": "1.\"Can you share a file with someone online?\" is the question. \n2. To answer the question, start by analyzing each of the six options in turn. \n3. \"Freeway\" is not connected to a computer network at all; therefore, there's no connection to share a file online from one user to another.\n4. \"Radio\" is a radio station that can transmit music and messages but can't share files online; therefore, it isn't connected to a computer network.\n5. \"Wires\" and \"computer network\" are not the same; a wire is an infrastructure that can facilitate a network, but a computer network itself is a network, not any other component of it. \n6. \"Computer network\" isn't connected to any other thing for the exchange of files, so it can't be shared online to a second user.\n7. Finally, \"electrical circuit\" is not a computer network, and it is connected to the computer network as another physical infrastructure for data transfer like a wire; therefore, while it is connected to the network, it isn't actually a computer network used to share files.\n8. This leaves us with \"wires\", which are physical infrastructures used to facilitate computer networks and provide a path to sharing a file. Therefore, the answer must be B: Wires.\nSo the final ans is B: wires \n\nInput: Which of the letters in this box could be part of the spelling of each of the words found in lines 2 through 11?

Moreover, information in the question is used in a negative sense, implying that you don't want to speak too much. \n3.\"Summarize main points\" is a good way to organize thoughts and communicate an idea, but it is not the only option. \n4.\"Have information\" is too vague to be useful. \n5.\"Organize thoughts\" is a correct answer because it includes organizing an idea in the brain as well as communicating that idea to another person. For example, if you have some thoughts about how to resolve an issue at work, you might first internalize the information by organizing it, and then you could speak the final thoughts to someone else and communicate your ideas.\nSo the final answers is C: Speak information\n\ninput: A group of 16 people went to the grocery store, what did they do when they left? Choices:  What:  A: eat a meal at home B: return some of their groceries C: clean up the store D: return to the grocery E: all of these occurred\nOutput: The question is asking about the activities that the group of 16 did when they left the grocery store. As there are 5 options, all of the choices cannot occur simultaneously. Let's look at each option individually:\n\n1. Choice A: Eat a meal at home: This does not make logical sense because they would not be home when they left the groceries. \n2.Choice B: Return some of their grocerites: As the question mentions that they left the groceterie store, this is unlikely. \n3. Choice C: Clean up the store: Makes sense to leave after cleaning up. However, even if the store has reopened, the people would likely be on their way home.\n4. Choices D&E: All of these can occur but it would not really make the meaning of the question and the answer would not make sense logically. \n5.

While not necessarily deadly by themselves, these choices could still lead to accidents.\n4) Which answers can't cause an accident? The choices that are not answer(s) of a previous answer (of previous question) are not the one to choose, e.g. B - dangerous, E - deadly, F - yes, so there's no reason to choose them.\n5) What is left as choices? The last choices are A - stressful, C - fun and D - illegal.\n6) Which one could lead to accident? It would be fun driving at a speed beyond the limit, which is illegal.\n7) Why we need to know all the steps below? - To decide who to tell the truth. If B is chosen, how would illegal driving cause an accident? - Would it not be dangerous, as in the answer D we chose previously? The reason we have to look at all these things is because a good guesser can try to make answers look connected (i.e. the first one can have a bad answer, and then the next one becomes bad) when they are trying to make the opponent guess the answer, and it would be easier for them to do that if there is a lot of steps.  \nTherefore, we need to think twice.\n8) If C - fun is chosen, how could stress be considered as an answer of illegal driving? Stressful driving could lead into dangerous and illegal driving in the most of the cases (there is an exception, but you can see below) - illegal driving, because it can lead to deadly, dangerous, and stressful driving - stressful driving, by definition, would be dangerous. If you consider this, it's easier to see the connection between illegal driving and stressful driving.\n9) If C - fun were chosen, would it mean that the same thing will happen to A - stressful (since one of the answers could be chosen in the next question), D - illegal, and F - yes?\nNo. F - yes has nothing to do with A - stressful", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

This means that it is very large. One of the best ways to identify this is by asking what are the characteristics of a tree.\n\n3, That is very tall and broad so, most likely, it is a very big tree that has few branches and leaves. \n\n4, Then we move on the second part of the question, which is two trees. Which means two is very small so it doesn't have many characteristics of a tree. Also, it has a lot of leaves and branches. So, all characteristics of a very tall and large tree are different. Therefore, there must be more leaves and branches on it.\n\n5, There for sure it is very small.

{"idx": 83, "text": "1) The key in this question is that the answer will be a descriptor that applies to dogs in general when they play around. So we want to start by discarding options that are not applicable to the majority of the answers. \n2) Let's take the simplest case first. For Choice A (that will be alive). How often do dogs play with you? Are they never alive when they play around. This is impossible to the question's context, so elimination!\n3) As far as Choice B (that will be healthy or health) are concerned, we have to consider the opposite, which is the majority descriptor (\"playing dead\" in Option E (that will have fun when playing)! If you asked me, \"What do you call it when a dead dog plays?\" Surely it's not \"playing dead\". In this case, playing dead is more specific than being healthy, so we will use playing dead for this choice too.\n4) Thus, what descriptor is there for Choice D (that have fun)? We look back to Option E (that play dead). We can see they use playing dead, which means the descriptor should be for \"playing around\", as playing playing dead is impossible. Also note that when dogs have fun while playing around, they do not need to literally be black. Therefore, it is clear that playing around is the correct answer. \n5) So where do we go from here? For our next descriptor, Choice C (that will get fun), we examine Option D (that play dead); if not playing around, then we have to be playing playing dead, which cannot be fun, and so we use playing around for this too. Lastly, the last option for option C (have fun), we are left with having fun again! Since we have already used the descriptor playing around for both dogs in general to have fun and dogs to be playing around, we have eliminated this descriptor and are left with no words to describe \"fun\" dogs in general. \nThus, the answer is C: \"playing around\". \nSo the final answer for this one is C: playing around", "answer": "C: fun"}

Option \"Income tax\" (B) involves having money taken from your paycheck. However, this does not necessarily have to do with getting paid, which is the main focus on the question. Income tax isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's not directly related to getting paid.\n3. Option \"Satisfaction\" (C) is also not the greatest answer choice because receiving money, specifically from a job or other work, could lead to satisfaction, but it does not directly indicate how getting paid is actually felt. For this reason, it's not an ideal answer if you're looking to understand a feeling.\n4. Option \"Ocean\" (E) seems like an odd selection for this question because receiving money does not necessarily involve the ocean. Additionally, this option is also highly unlikely. It doesn't seem as if \"paying bills\" (D), or even \"paying taxes\" (F) really feel much like going to the ocean.\n5. That leaves us with the final answer of \"Happy\" (A). This is a great answer choice because it involves feeling happy. This feeling can be directly related to getting paid as a result of a job, which makes it more accurate.\n\nSo the final answer can:\n\nAnswer:\nB.", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

That means it's not the correct answer. \n5 E: A field of flowers includes various types of flowers that are each of their own respective colors.

Choices: 1: cap 2: mask 3: helmet 4: sweatband 5: beanie 6: stocking cap\nOutput: 1: The 2nd item on the list is \"cap\". This cannot be the correct answer because \"pain\" and \"headache\" are two different things referring to various states of being. While certain items on the head could cause pain, a headache is not what we are looking for.\n2: The 5th item on the list is a \"mask\", which is not a type of item that could be on the head and cause pain. \n3: The 3rd option is a \"helmet\". Many helmets also have ear gaps and open ventilation holes that could conceivably cause pain on one's head. However, this is not the type of head pain we are looking for because helmets are also used to protect from certain head injuries and therefore cannot cause headaches.\n4: The 4th item, a \"sweatband\" is actually a common accessory that could cause pain to one's head, but it is not what we are seeking. \n5: The 6th option is a \"stocking cap\". Stocking caps can have stitching, padding, and other elements", "answer": "D: rose garden"}
{"idx": 95, "text": "1.\"Demolished\" means \"to cause to be destroyed or to be no longer in use\", which is not the same as \"to no longer be in existence\".\n2.\"Wasteland\" (B) is not an accurate answer to this question since it does not mean \"made no longer in use\".\n3.\"Ocean\"(C) and \"Parking Lot\" (D) are the most relevant, as they contain the word \"land\".\n4. However, \"Parking Lot\", according to the meaning of \"made of land\", as well as the fact it is not \"no longer in use\", is not an accurate answer.\n5. Thus, the answer must be either \"Ocean\" or \"Parking Lot\".\n\n6. Let us analyse these two options from a different angle. The question is about a city, and the word \"city\" only applies to land. This means that by definition, the answer must be a piece of land.\n7. An ocean does not meet these criteria, as an \"ocean\" is, in fact, water, which is not land.\n8. Also, the word \"demolished\" cannot make the ocean be \"no longer in use\" since the ocean never stops being present in the first place. There cannot be a demolition of water.\n9. As a result, an ocean cannot be the right answer.\n10. Likewise, \"Parking lot\" (D) does not meet the required requirements of being a \"piece of land\" as it is not land. A parking lot is an assemblage of \"land\", but is not \"land\" itself. It is not a piece of land. \n11. As a result, \"Parking Lots\" cannot be the correct answer.\n\n12. Therefore, the only remaining choice is \"Ocean\"(C).\nSo the final answer in this question is \"Ocean\"\n\nInput: What is used to take down a tree?

To understand which of the remaining 4 are the illnesses, we need to explain the meaning of the words, which will help us identify why they can't be illnesses (as many people don't experience these emotions).\n4. \"Glad\" (E) is defined as feeling or showing pleasure or approval. The key word in the sentence is \"gladly\", which implies we're discussing a state of happiness.\n5. \"Unhappy\" (D), means very unhappy or suffering a great deal of the misfortune or wretchedness. Again, the key word here is \"unhappy\", which is not synonymous with the meaning of \"glad\" or \"gloomy\" (meaning dark, gloomy, dim, murky, cloudy, tinged with sadness), even if these 3 word are sometimes used together. Hence, we'll exclude it as a possible illness. \n6. \"Gloomy\" (F) can take on several meanings, but the common description is gloomy because of a particular situation. (in other words, not because gloom is the illness that causes you to be ungrateful). If gloom is the illiness that prevents you from looking upon life optimistically, it can't be you're experiencing an excess of it.\n7. This leaves D and E as options because neither of them mean that these illnesses are characterized by suffering a great deal, so they make sense.\n8. Eliminating any other choices that are not illnesses such as anger (C), anger does not mean depressed or ungrateful. In fact, it's the opposite. Angry people tend to be unhappy and grumpy, but anger is not one of four possible illnesses.\n9. There is only one illness left that could cause these four emotions (depression, sadness, anger, and unhappiness", "answer": "A: depressed"}

That excludes options that have nothing to do with gathering of pollen. \n2. Let' use eliminate the options that don't involve the gathering of pollen by a bee. The bee could gather pollen by collecting it on his or her legs, thus \"sky\" (B) is not the right answer here. The bee could not collect pollen from \"court\" (C) because there are no flowers on a court and no bees in a court either. \n3.

Choices 1 and 4 suggest that the plumber will do something. So we now consider whether the actions suggested are actions that plumbers perform. For instance, \"unpack the options\" can be a plumber's job. 4. Choices 2 and 5 suggest no plumber action. Plumbers do not typically repair drywall nor do they typically build walls. So we eliminate those options as not related to plumbers. 5. Choices 3 and 6 suggest that the plumber may need to be on-site. Plumbers are typically sent to specific sites by request and they are not typically working in a building or office and they typically do not need to find themselves an assignment to work on. 6. So the answer is 3: an \"assignment\" is the action of choosing where a plumber should work. So our answer is:", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

Let's start by ruling out options that do not qualify. \"Kitchen cupboard\" (B) is not an ideal location because it is also subject to spoiling when left out. \"Grocery store\" (D) is also not a valid choice because it is not likely to spoil as quickly as left out, and the jar will be on display in a public space. \n3.) The remaining options are all valid. \"Pantry\" (C) is acceptable because pantries are a type of cabinet and are subject to being spoiled by bacteria growth. \n4.) \"Pantry\" (A) and \"Refrigerator\" (E) are both also great options because they both provide a place to hide spoiling items. This is a benefit of pantry vs. refrigerator storage since a pantry is generally not accessed as often as a refrigerator, and items in the refrigerator tend to be accessed more frequently.

From the options, \"Mountain\" (A) does not seem to help create a splash. It's possible that a mountain could create an impact similar to throwing a rock in a lake. However, this is unlikely because a mountain would need to have a similar speed to a river to impact in the same manner. \n4. Next is \"Countryside\" (B). From what we know, the countryside is not a body of water. Thus, this does not seem to produce a splash. \n5. \"Ground\" (C) appears to be the correct answer because the impact would be determined by the rock's weight and height. If the rock is very heavy, it could make a big impact regardless of where it is dropped. If the weight is not too great, the impact will be determined by the surface area of the object and its velocity. Since the ground itself is already very flat, it would not create a large splash unless the rock is very large. \n6.

We remove everything but \"what?\" and \"completely\", which we can put into the form of a question. \n7. \"Was the scary decoration completely what?\" is an acceptable answer. \"Scary decorations are completely what\" is also fine, but \"completely what\" does not make sense because it doesn't connect to an element of being scary decoration. \"what\" is a noun modifying a noun. \"completely\" can modify the subject, so there is no question of whether or not completely\" makes sense. \n8. The answer is E: Completely\nSo the final answer in this case is: Was the scary decoration Completely what?", "answer": "E: horrible"}
{"idx": 151, "text": "1: We will start by understanding the concept in English. The question asks what you do to wood to attach something.

Choices: 2A: overjoyed B: overthought C: depressed D: confused E: unchanged\nOutput: 1) The first step is to determine the key words in the phrasing. \"a bad day\" and \"feel after a bad day\". \"feel\" is the correct response.\n2) Now we will compare \"feeling after a bad day\" to each option.\n3) Choices A, B and D are all things that may happen after \"a bad day\", but Choice C is the opposite of feeling after \"a bad day\".\n4) Choices A and C share the same feeling. However, Choice B is not the opposite of feeling happy after a bad day.\n5) The two remaining choices are feelings that could happen after a bad day and the only difference is how a person might feel, but Choice B is negative, not positive.

The question is asking for a type of building, so all the other types of objects are in the wrong answer slots. There must be multiple levels, but they could have any number of floors or stories inside.\n3) Since the carpet shop is a building, it must have multiple levels. It might have floors or stories inside, but as long as there is more than one of those interior levels in the building, the carpet shop meets the criteria for the answer.\nSo the final answers are A: Carpet shop", "answer": "C: garage"}

And by working closely together and in harmony, we mean that they were not fighting or shouting or otherwise showing signs of conflict and that they were working productively together.\n1. \"Office\" (A) would not be the correct answer. While in an office, people would work closely together and likely would interact with one another closely, this is not necessarily what the question is asking about.\n2. \"Party\" (B) could potentially be the answer but this is not as likely. A party may have a group of people, but it is not uncommon for there to be conflict at a party, so the working together would likely be interrupted by people arguing or fighting or showing other signs of unproductive disson", "answer": "B: plan to marry"}

Similarly, \"Purchase\" (C) similarly tells us nothing about the prior price. \n3) The answers here are in their past tense form. \"Overpriced\" (D) tells us the game was not expensive before. \"Way too much\" (E) tells us the game is now expensive relative to the original price. \n4) Let's now look at the remaining options. \"Was usually\" (A) is the correct answer. This implies that the original price was higher than the reduced sale price.

A good way to answer a multiple choice question is to start by eliminating the options that aren't directly related to the question. \"Front of Door\" (A) is a location that you might find your desk, but it isn't the most likely place to spill ink on a rug.\n3. Similarly, we can eliminate \"Living room\" (E) and \"Table\" (D) as the rug would probably be in a different part of the house than these.\n4. The remaining options (B, C, and E) each relate to the piece of furniture that has an inkwell. \"Living room\" likely has a place where items are stored such as a bedroom or a desk.\n5.

Choices: A: the forest B: a warm home C: under the bridge D: inside 12\nOutput: 1  Understanding the question 1)  Where does a troll live? Under the bridge  2) Which one of the places that a troll might live contains warmth and comfort? The warmer places in the troll\u2019s home would be the living room, the kitchen, and perhaps the bedroom.\n2. To answer the question, let\u2019s evaluate the choices. If the troll is in a warm home, where would it obtain warmth?  If the troll is under the bridge, where would it obtain heat?\n3. To answer \u201cunder the bridge,\u201d there is no additional benefit that the troll would get. If it is already under the bridge, there is no reason why it would need warmth.\n4. If we select option B (at home), there are places in the troll home where heat might come from to give warmth.\n5. The choices under the bridge are not providing warmth, and the indoors are not providing warmth because a troll lives outside.\n6.

The husband is likely to feel isolated after his wife asks him about getting divorced. After this situation, the husband will understandably be left out of the marriage, which causes him to feel isolated from his friends.\nSo the final answers are E: isolation\n\nInput: Which is not one of the following?  Choices:  A. a dog B. a pig C. a cat D. a horse E. a rat\nOutput: 1) All options are animals. Therefore, we can eliminate Choice \"C: a cat\" and Choice \"D: a horse\" from the question.\n2) Choice \"D: horse\" being one of the options is incorrect because a horse is an animal.\n3) Choice \"E: a rat\" being one of the choices is incorrect since a rat is an animal.\n4) Choice \"B: a pig\" being an of the options is incorrect as a pig is an animal.\n5) Choice \"A: a dog\" doesn't seem like one of the options, but it is.\nSo the final option is \"A: a dog\", which is the correct answer.\n\nInput: At what time of day might beastiality occur the most?

{"idx": 239, "text": "1. First, let's consider what the question asks. It asks, \"What would you change learning to be if someone does NOT like learning?\" Therefore, the key here is \"not like learning\".\n2. Considering this, if someone does not like it, they would not appreciate learning being \"interesting\", \"fun\", \"joyful\", or \"more important.\" These choices are all good adjectives that describe learning. \n3. Therefore, we can eliminate these options because none of them would satisfy what the question asked. Option B: \"change the learning process to be fun\" is incorrect, as the word \"fun\" only means enjoyable or amusing.\n\n4. Option C: \"change it to joyful or painful\" is incorrect as it does not address what the question specifically asks. If a student isn't fond of learning, how can they become joyful of painful?\n5. Option D: \"change learning to be very important\" is incorrect because if someone does not like to learn, then the value of learning is not very important to them, therefore the option is incorrect. \n6. The final answer is E: \"change it to free,\" because if someone doesn't like learning, the value of being able to do so freely would make it enjoyable. The word \"free\" means liberated or unrestricted. \n7. Therefore, the answer would be free to learn.\nSo the final answers are E: free \n\nInput: What would I need so I wouldn't need to have my own internet?  Choices:  A. Wi-Fi at a public place B. A public library C. Mobile phone D. Wireless connection E. Different laptop\nOutput: 1 Let's examine the various options to see which choice works best:\n2. Choice B: \"A public library\" indicates that this choice describes physical library but not an internet access point. To find internet access using only a computer, you could go to the library and use it on their network, but you would need your own device.\n3. Choices D and E: \"Different laptop\" and \"Mobile phone\" are not the most appropriate in the context of this question. These describe computers that you already have.\n1. \"Wi-Fi at a public-place\" is the correct answer, because it describes Wi-Fi without having a different", "answer": "B: fun"}

The person would not go to the hotel itself, but instead to cross the street. A person could also go out (D), but this answer does not relate to air travel or hotels.\n3) Going on vacation (D) is a goal that could arise through controlling a computer (C) or separating things (C). These do not, however, logically relate.\n4) The question is about what an individual was looking to do through controlling a computer, not about what an individual is doing through controlling a computer.\n5) Thus, the answer is either A: control computer or D: go on vacation.\nSo the final answers are either A: control computer  or D: go on  vacation\n \n### Solution :\n\nInput: 5 divided by 3 is?\n\n### Answer\n\nThe answer for Question 1 is 4/3 (4 divided by 3).\n\n### Solution \n\nFirst, 5 divided by 2 is 2.\nNext, 5 divided by.1 is 50.\nThus, 5 divided by the sum of all options, 2 and 50, is 4.\nFinally, divide 5 by 4 and the quotient is 1 and the remainder is -4.\nThe remainder -4 can be dropped because it is not part of the solution, and therefore, 4 is the exact answer.

{"idx": 247, "text": "1: Looking at the premise of the puzzle, we can make some educated guesses. For example, we know the woman was picked from an apple tree. \n\n2. Also, the question states \"surrounded by other trees.\" This leads us to assume the woman was surrounded by trees outside. \n\n3. Another piece of information: \"picked from an apple tree while \nsurrounded by other\ntrees.\" Perhaps the woman was surrounded by apple trees, \nhowever, they were\ndifferent types. \n\n4.

What are they attempting to get? Choices: \nA: money B: clothes C: something D: none of the rest\nOutput: 1) It is not possible to get anything from nothing. The wording of this question seems to imply, though, that you can get something from nothing in some cases. \n2) First let's eliminate some of the less obvious answers. \"Money\" (A) is a type of thing, so it would not be possible to get money from nothing, in which case \"nothing\" would be the answer. \n\n3) Let's look at \"nothing\" (C) more closely. \"Nothing\" would not qualify for the answer, in my opinion, because \"clothes\" (B) wouldn't be a feasible option since you cannot get clothes from nothing. Additionally, the premise of not being able to get something from nothing rules out the option \"something\" (D).\n\n4) Because the options don't make physical sense when trying to get something from nothing, the only logical answer is \"none of the above\" (B).\n\nSo the final \nanswer is D: none\n\nInput: Where did I get these pancakes, and where are the people who've had them before eating them?

{"idx": 251, "text": "1.\nTo answer this question, let's eliminate the choices that do not apply. Changing shoes (B) is a personal choice and kids aren't usually bored while doing that.\n2. While walking can be a way to get out of boredom and have fun, it's another activity that kids are unlikely to do while bored because of their youthful energy level.\n3. Children do play tag as a fun activity, but playing tag can also occur when children aren't bored. Therefore, we eliminate that choice.\n4. Smelling smoke can also be a fun activity for teenagers, but that isn't exclusive to boredom. If it occurred during boredom, it could also be a way to alleviate boredom.\n5. Similarly, for \"reaching over\" (E), it doesn't need to be directly related to boredom. Kids might reach over when they want to see something they couldn't see before, regardless of whether it was out of boredom or not.\n6. Comparing the remaining choices, it becomes clear that children will play tag when they are bored.\n7.

(3) The other three choices offer valid interpretations of the gift. (4) We can conclude that the king gave away fruits and pizza.\nSo", "answer": "C: play tag"}
{"idx": 255, "text": "1.\"Get a ball\" is the action associated with the question. This implies we will be at a store to get the ball and then return to a previous location on foot (therefore not a place you drive to).\n2.The question is not asking which place has the best or biggest selection of balls, but specifically asking for a place to obtain *a* ball.\n3.The store (D) will not be a good place because a store will not give you a ball for free and we don't know if the ball is already purchased so we can't return the ball for a refund.\n4.We can also eliminate the child's hand (C) because of the previous point. They either have to buy the ball to give it to us or we have to hand over money to the parent to pay for the ball.\n5.A soccer game (E), like a store, will not give us a ball. In addition, we can eliminate the kitchen (B) because a ball is not typically found here. We can also eliminate the street (D).

None of them is a set of objects B. Set of apples C: Set of houses D: Set of rocks E: Set of numbers\nOutput: 1: \"Which is the only choice that...\" The sentence structure reveals that one of the choices is NOT a set of objects. We must rule out this one, and the logical thing to do is examine it in the answer chain first. 2) Only one of the answer choices is a set of objects, and that is B: a set of apples. Each apple is a discrete object and can exist alone as part of a set. An apple is also part of a set with the other apples on a tree.

{"idx": 315, "text": "Let's check each of the options to see if they are exhibited by the \"bad guys\". \n1. \"Deceptive\" (A) is something you would expect a villain to do, and so it's a good candidate for an exhibited trait. However, we can easily see this trait in the \"good guys\" as well. Therefore, it's not necessarily something that only the villains exhibit.\n2. \"Altruistic\" (B) also implies helping others, so a villain could also be altruistic.\n3. \"Stupid\" (C) is another characteristic that would be expected of the villains, but you could also find it in a hero. \n4. \"Cruel\" (D) would be another trait of a villain which is usually present. It is often portrayed that the villains are also \"cold\" or \"heartless\" and this is an example of having a cruel streak.\n5. Lastly, \"Aggressivity\" (E) also indicates a villainous behavior, so it could be the correct answer. \n6. Now let's test the other options to see if they can be ruled out. \n7. \"Aggressiveness\" is a common villain trait, but this is not a good choice because the answers given are for a singular trait and \"aggressiveness\" is not a single trait. \n8. \"Passive\" is also a common villain trait and it is not suitable for the question asked.\n9. \"Angry\" is used for an emotion that you can feel, not a specific trait that you would experience.\n10. \"Eye-shadow\" is not a trait that you would find in someone purposely or inadvertently hurting someone else's feelings.\n11.

{"idx": 323, "text": "1.\"What does someone want when... trying to fit in?\" The implication here is that the user is on a team, and that there's in-group vs. out-group pressure. In this case, the question is about a group (in-group) where someone wants to fit in, with the pressure to do so being that they want to play alongside their friends.\n2.\"To be understood\" isn't what someone wants when they want to fit in. Being understood can be a benefit, but it doesn't really relate to having fun with your friends. People who have friends enjoy spending time together, playing, talking, and being silly.\n3.\"Playing around\" and \"hugging\" are too specific. There are many ways to have fun with your friends, including making a game of the day. Additionally, hugging could be a way to express friendship, but it could also be an action related to a specific play/game.\n4. Choices \"playing around\" and \"visiting friends\" are also too specific. There can be many types of play and games, and visits could be related to fun, but could also just be a way to have some friendly time together. \n5. Therefore, \"to fit in\" is a reasonable goal if you have friends, and doing so with your friends is fun. This makes \"Being understood\" an outlier. This is because being in an in-group (and hence trying to fit in) means that a lot of time is spent with group members, with your level of understanding changing depending on their understanding of the group and its dynamics.\nFinally, the only possible answers left that match what this person is looking for are being understood and playing around.\n6. Therefore, the answer choices are B and D. \n So the final answer is B: Being understood and D: playing around", "answer": "A: being understood"}
{"idx": 327, "text": "1 and 2. The little girl was raised selfless. \n3. \"Selfish\" is defined as caring primarily or excessively about oneself. Thus, this could not be the answer choice.\n4.  \"Mean\" refers to someone who is cruel, unkind, and who displays hostility or anger to others. This is also not the answer, as the question states that the little girl was not doing any of these things.\n5. \"Unfeeling\" means not having a heart or not caring. This answer is also not correct, as the question states explicitly that the little girl did not care when she was doing whatever it was she was doing. This leaves us with \"Careless\" and \"Uncaring\".\n6. Careless is defined as being inattentive or indifferent to consequences. Although \"Careless\" is an obvious possibility - the girl was certainly not being attentive - there is a better and correct answer: \"Uncaring\". \n7. Careless is the incorrect answer, while 'Uncaring' is the correct answer to the question.\nSo the final answers are A: Uncaring and B: Careless", "answer": "C: being mean"}

This is because you already know whether or not you eat hamburgers in this situation.\n4) Choice C: It is not fun to eat hamburger with a stranger, but this is not a reaction to eating hamburger alone. This could cause confusion, but it is not a reaction.\n5) Choice D: While it is possible to get heartburn from eating hamburger, eating hamburger at home does not cause heartburn and eating hamburger with a friend does not cause heartburn. What happens in all scenarios is that heartburn occurs. This makes it extremely unlikely for the question to even exist.\n6) Choice E: You could get sick from eating hamburgers with someone who is not a trusted source.

{"idx": 335, "text": "1: First, eliminate the obvious inaccurate answer choices. If the person was already at the mountains, they obviously could already be breathing there fresh air. In addition, how could they hyperventilate and feel good at the same time?\n2. Now let's examine the potential correct answer choices. \"Breathe deeply\" (D) is correct. Breathing deeply feels good and you breathe in more fresh air at higher lengths. However, this choice doesn't have enough specific information to directly identify it as the correct answer. \n3. Similarly, \"Look around\" (E) is incorrect because the person clearly is aware of their surroundings because they can feel the fresh mountain air. The most direct choice is \"Living\" (A) because the breathing is more enjoyable the farther away from urban areas someone is. In that case, the person's first reaction is to embrace the area's fresh mountain air and live there.\nSo the final answers are A: Living and D: Breathe Deeply. \n\nInput:A place where one would get to see wild animals up close is Choices:  A) zoo B) museum C) jungle\nOutput: 1) First, let's remove all the wrong answers. You cannot get to see wild animals in a museum or in the middle of the city, so A) and B) are not correct.  2) The answer could be C) the jungle. This is the only answer where you can see animals without fences. However, the wild animals you can see here are the dangerous ones like lions. There are also places that offer safari experiences.  3) The correct answer is E) wildlife sanctuary. A wildlife sanctuary is the same place as a zoo but without bars.

{"idx": 347, "text": "1) The question asks which character is different from the fragile man. The fragile man is trying to cause accidents, so the opposite of that would be someone who is resistant to accidents or someone who does not cause accidents.\n2) \"Fragile man\" is not the answer. The fragile man wants to cause accidents.\n3) It is difficult to determine if the \"undestroyable man\" is referring to destruction like fires or swords, or if it refers to accidents. To be precise, \"undestroyable\" means the man cannot be destroyed. This can indicate immortality.\n4) \"Unbreakable\" means someone who is physically incapable of being damaged. This is an acceptable option.\n5) \"Indestructible\" means a permanent inability to be destroyed. This would not occur because the fragile man has the power to kill without needing accidents.\n6) \"Durable\" is something to do with the material strength of the man. \"Durable\" can refer to the body of the man, but it could also mean the man's powers.\n7) \"Invisible\" refers to something being without visibility or being undetectable. The fragile man can detect the other man, so it is not the correct answer.\n8) Using the above answers, \"Unbreakable\" can be eliminated. The man is undetectable and he causes accidents, which means the man is likely a magical character incapable of being destroyed, like a ghost, witch, or vampire.\n9) The question asks \"undestroyable or a person opposite of the fragile man\". If a man is undestroyable and the fragile man is his opposite, the man must be someone who isn't capable of making accidents like the fragile man who does. That option therefore, means the man is a character who can't cause accidents, which is the correct answer, and the only remaining choice.\n10) Therefore, the answer is B: Unbreakable\nSo the final answer in this question is B: Unbreakble", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}

Such a setting is unlikely to have a shower available.\n5: Choice C: A seashore does not fit, as many public beaches have outdoor showers, but they are not typically found in an accommodation for the night.\n6: Choice D: This does not fit as bathrooms are generally not open to the public as the bathroom showers are, and are also usually not as ornate.\n7: Choice E: A locker room does not fit as they are not typically places where one stays the night, nor do their showers offer the same decor and style as a hotel or B&B bathroom.

The answer choice is looking for the reason why someone would go to counseling. \n\n2. Eliminate the unnecessary answers.

Another reason why someone would go for counseling. (B) \"Receive Gifts\" is not a reason because the focus of counseling is not receiving gifts. In counseling, the person is focusing on themselves and does not expect counsel to give them gifts.\n\n4. The next answer choice (C) is \"Understand Themselves.\" This is a valid answer because counseling can allow a person to understand themselves more.\n\n5. An answer that is not true and could be eliminated is answer choice (D) which states \"Good things in life\". This is a good thing in life, but this is not necessarily a reason why a person would go to counselor. \n\n6. The final choice is answer choice (E). The reason why counseling is to \"acknowledge their life.\" Counseling can help to improve a persons life, as long as they are acknowledging their life.\n\n7.

Next is \"A. Have fun\", which is a good answer, because you will have more time to explore Vegas and have fun. \"It was their spring break and they were going home to go with their friends\" is not needed, because you already know everyone is going home to have spring break with friends.\n5. \"They may feel more confident\". \"E\" is not enough because this is just what \"Get ready\" means, to get ready.

It was then \"beyond repair\" (unfixable) and the third sentence states that the old barn was removed. The important words are \"barn\": it is not just a building; the barn must be the old one.\n2. Now, we have to find out the main verb and answer choice. We notice \"they had to first remove it...\" which shows that the whole phrase \"remove it\" is the answer choice. All of the other answer choices imply a future action, while \"remove it\" implies what happened next.\n3. When we remove the incorrect answer choices, we're left with \"remove it\", in which case \"destroy it\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final, correct answer is B: destroy\n\nInput:The people who can work after a heavy party are called the \"what\"? Choices:  A group B group of people C: partygoers D: morning people E: night people\nOutput: 1,\"The people who continue working after a heavy party are sometimes known as...\" The key phrase in this question is \"who continue to...\". If you read the question, you can see that this phrase is missing a word (\"who can work after a heavy \"). This means that the question is asking about people who continue to work after a heavy party.\n2. Let us eliminate the options which are not relevant to the party. \"A group\" (A) is not a relevant group; it doesn't have members. Similarly, while \"C: partygoers\" (B) is relevant in some ways, it is not necessary to have experienced the party to be able to work the next day.\n3. Now we have to find out what \"people who can work after a party are sometimes known as\". Since the question was: \"the people who keep working after a heavy party\" the phrase \"people who can work\" is the answer choice, so we must determine what group/classification the phrase \"people who continue to work\" refers to.\n4. \"The people\" is not appropriate here because \"continue to work\" is in reference to a group. As a group, they are referred to by a different title.\n5. We", "answer": "B: raise"}

The statement \"the cupboards were barren\" is providing a key piece of information: something was missing from the cupboard. The cupboard must have been empty!\n3. This makes the statement \"so they had to go what?\" obvious: \"go and get food.\" This tells us the action of getting food must follow.\n4. Let's get rid of options that aren't possible or don't directly follow from the preceding facts. \"Cook dinner\" (B) is not possible given that there is no food in the cupboard. \"Eat\" (D) falls in the same category because that wouldn't be the reason to go get food. \"Make food\" (E) is not as clear, but noting that the cupboard was barren, it seems unlikely that they could have used ingredients in the cupboard to make their own food.\n5. \"Go back to work\" (C) is the only remaining answer, and it follows from our initial conditions and information we have deduced. \n6. \"The action of getting food must happen next\" (1) is the conclusion of the question \"So the final answer is...\" (2) is the final answer given 2 and 1.\nSo the final question is \"So the final answer to \"They wanted to eat at... \"is A: They wanted to go back to work.\"\nThey wanted to go back to their job.", "answer": "E: get food"}
{"idx": 407, "text": "1) Let's start by looking at each of the answer options individually.\n2) \"Hear testimony\" is not an answer, because if you can't leave your house, you can't travel somewhere else to hear a testimony. And \"See exhibits\" is also not an answer, because while you can see exhibits online, being curious is not something limited to the internet experience.\n3) The answer that eliminates itself first is \"Go somewhere\", as you cannot do that if you cannot leave your house.\n4) But the remaining options are each a possible answer: \"Surf net\" is a possibility if you have access to the internet, \"Outdoor concert\" is a possibility if there's an outdoor concert nearby, and \"Testify\" is a possibility if someone decides to testify somewhere nearby.\n5) But ultimately, the least direct answer is \"Outdoor Concert\", and that leaves us with \"Surf Net\" and \"Testify\".\n6) So the question we must answer is, if we're curious, but cannot leave our home, which has the least amount of effort in it.\n7) The choice with the lowest amount of energy is obviously \"Surf Net\", since that is virtually no effort at all. Just look at it online. While it is also possible to \"testify\" somewhere, that would be a much more active experience, which the question implies it cannot be (since it must take place \"if you have curiosity about something, but cannot leave your house\").\nSo the final answer to the multiple choice question is A: Surf Net.\n\nInput: If people don't like coffee, then what do they usually drink instead?

A tuxedo is an outfit that you could wear when attending a fancy party or wedding. Not a sign that you are wealthy and flaunter it.\n4.

These involve schedules and are not associated with work.\n5) \"late\". These are time-related, rather than having to do with the difficulty of work.\n6) \"time consuming\".

The difficulty comes from having to do work.\n\nFrom here, we want to look at an answer choice that would make sense given what we know. Only one answer choice gives us some kind of difficulty and that is \"impatience\" (E).\nThus the answer is E: impatience.\nSo the final step is A: having appointements\n\nInput:What is a place with a door but no room?

It is used to connect two things, rather than a use of its own.\n\"Laundry room\" (e) contains a door leading to a room.\nFrom this, we can deduce that the door in question is on the outside of a place where there is at least one room, which leads us to the answer as \"staircase\" (d).\nSo the final answer to What is a place with a...? is d: staircase.\n  \nInput: In what time did George Washington become the First", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

Eliminating the locations that are not applicable to carrying something, we're left with \"Briefcase\" (B), \"Carry Object\" (C), and \"Carry It On Your Hat\" (E).\n4. Briefcase is possible as a place to carry things, but it is not usually big enough to carry large objects.\n5. Carry object is not a place nor does it imply the plan to carry it with, so it is eliminated.\n6. Finally, we are left with \"Carry it on your hat\". This is not possible as people will not typically wear hats on their head, but instead will wear them on their body, as when they carry a purse or shoulder bag.\n7. Since there is only one choice possible, \"Carry It On A Hat\" is the answer, but it doesn't make sense.\n8. Thus, \"Carry it...\" is incorrect, as the answer is either \"On...\", \"In...\" or \"With....\"\n9. \"Carry it on\" is a noun phrase, where \"it\" is the object you're carrying. \n10.

From the rest of the choices, \"surface of earth\" (D) seems too large since \"almost all people\" implies a high level of certainty. This is also unlikely due to the relatively low density of population in each square mile and the fact that not all people live on the same continent. \n6. \"Office\" (A) is also not the answer because offices do not host living or even sleeping facilities, which would be considered living. \n7.

Let's answer this question by evaluating each answer choice: \"A: they look forward to it\"? If there is no expectation for a toy, then it doesn't matter whether or not one is given. For example, if they lose their toys frequently, it would not matter if you give another one because they would not \"look forward to receiving it\" since they do not have an expectation that they will keep it.\n2). \"B: it will improve their attention\"? Not necessarily. If they had a toy before and do not get it and are okay with that, then they did not expect attention to be improved with getting that new toy, implying that it won't improve their focus.\n3). \"C: they don't have one before\"? If they already have one, then they don't need one.\n4). \"D: they look forward to using this\"?

{"idx": 527, "text": "1) Understanding what is being asked: The question asks about an advertisement and what it might be placed on. It does not specify specifically where this would be, which means it could be in a place where it is difficult to see.\n2) Ruling out possible answers: \"Bus\" (E) is not accurate because although there may be some advertisements on there, they would be primarily on buses and this would not describe someone dancing and waving a magazine. \"Web page\" (A) is not accurate because there are no advertisements on web pages and this describes someone waving or advertising an advertisement. \"Store\" (B) is not accurate because while it is commonly known that there are advertisements on some store windows, this would not accurately describe being inside a store. \"Magazine\" (C) is neither accurate nor inaccurate. It could be used for advertising, but this would not describe someone using it as an advertisement. \n3) Ruling out incorrect answers: \"Office\" (D) is inaccurate because although it might be outside, advertising usually is not done on offices. \"Airplane\" (F) is inaccurately outside. We could also eliminate \"Sidewalk\" (G), although this could potentially describe someone dancing, it doesn't accurately describe someone waving and advertisement. 4) Ruling in the correct answer: It is the case that advertisements are commonly posted on billboards, which could best describe someone dancing and advertising. Therefore, the answer must be billboard. So the final answer is F: billboard\n\nInput:How could I know exactly how much someone had drunk by filling up their glass just a little bit more?

A broken leg would prevent them from being able to do this, as it wouldn't work\n4) Consider third option C: hospital bed: a hospital bed is ideal for a broken leg because it can provide the elevation necessary to support a leg while also providing a sturdy base for lying down.\n5) Consider forth option D: legroom: Legroom refers to the amount of space available for your legs when you're seated. It doesn't involve laying on a broken leg and doesn't make sense in relation to the question.\n6) Consider fifth option E: Grand piano: While a person could potentially lay on their broken leg on a grand piano, a grand piano is not ideal for supporting a broken leg. It doesn't make sense as a solution to the problem.\n7) Therefore, we conclude that option C: hospital bed is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is C: hospital bed\n\nInput:How did the old lady pay for her groceries?

ATM card could not be a valid answer in a grocery as those typically do not take other forms of cards but just your bank card. 2. Credit card would not be an acceptable answer. Not allowed in grocery store 3. ATM card is an acceptable answer 4. Debit card is an acceptable answer but it would be debit debit card and not credit. 5. Cash card is not an acceptable answer as it is only used to access money in a bank account from ATM machine and not to buy products in a grocery like paypal. So the correct answer is an ATM card\n\nInput:I think my brother", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}

Cracked heels would mean that the heels have a fissure or crack, and would not be found on the other answer choices.\n3. Boot (B) is not correct. The person wearing the boot has not experienced cracked heels, so cracked heels would not be found on a boot.\n4. Similarly, desert (C) is not correct. A desert is a type of terrain, which can also be found on the foot, but cracked heels are not on desert sand.\n5. A hock is a joint on a sheep, so the correct answer is A: the foot.\nSo the final Answer is A: foot\n\nInput: If you had just seen a movie, you might___________. Choices:  A. not know who directed it B. not want to watch it C.not talk about it D. not care E. not see it anytime soon\nOutput: 1: As the phrase \"just seen a movie\" implies, having just finished watching the movie (or at least knowing its plot) is essential for being able to make the intended question.\n2: Let's begin by eliminating Choice A, which is unlikely to be true as it might refer to their entire life or not just recently.\n3: Moving to Choice B, it's unlikely that the person just watched the movie and not know who directed it. They would then have the intention of viewing the movie and might search for the director, but the statement does not explicitly include this.\n4: Choice C can be eliminated as well. If the person doesn' t want to talk about the movie, then they'd not mention their opinion (either positive or negative) when prompted. \n5: Choices D and E are incorrect because \"not care\", \"not want to watch it\" and \"not want to talk about it\" are contradictory to \"not care\", so the person is interested and wants to discuss it, and thus it is Choice B.\nSo the final choice is B: not want to watch it\n\nInput: Which of these is not considered a pet?

The first one is clear: the answer is A: shelf. You put coffee mugs on shelves.\n3) The second question part, in my opinion, is more difficult. It is asking what happens after the mug becomes dry. After the coffee mug is dry, what do we do with it?\n4) To find this part of the answer, we should start by looking at the different choices. The first choice (B) is incorrect. \"Put it on the desktop\" makes no sense if the coffee mug is already on a desktop to begin with.\n5) Similarly, the next choice (C) cannot be the answer because \"Put it in a cupboard\" doesn't really indicate where the coffee mug is placed.\n6) The next few choices become a little bit less clear because they are asking us to choose the option that does something after the coffee mug is dried.\n7) Thus it becomes difficult to pick out the correct answer, and a fair bit gets lost in the details. With that in mind, I will make my choice as \"put it on a shelf\", which happens to be correct. \n8) The final answer is then: I put my coffee mugs on the shelf after they are dry.\nSo the final answers is A: shelf\n\nInput:How will you most likely see the sun?

This may be an efficient way to pick one brand at a time, but it will not be a complete solution.\n4) Choice c: Department Store. This isn't a comprehensive way to get everything done in two hours because you will need to shop for a variety of categories.

The last two remaining answer choices, \"Lose money\" (E) and \"Children suffer\" (F) describe a negative outcome experienced by someone other than a spousal divorce. Therefore, the answer must be one of these two.\n3. Let's examine \"Children suffering\" (F) in more detail. \n4. Children who experience divorce often have issues with grief and loss, and may feel guilt and disappointment. These mental health issues can contribute to feelings of stress and anxiety.

Looking for a ponytail under a stationery hat (E) would involve removing the stationery items and searching underneath, which is not relevant to our context in this question.\n4. Let's look at the other two answers.  \"Stationery store\" (D) is the most logical choice because this store is dedicated to stationery items such as pearlers and ponytails.\n5. \"Desk drawer\" (E) could be correct as well, since it is an item located on a desk. However, this item could not possibly be a pearler (A), because it is made of metal and only made of wood (B, C, D). It could not be a ponytail (E) because that is a hair accessory item only (not stationery, C). It could not be both items (A, E) or (B, E) because they are made of different materials and one of them requires a piece of wood (B).\n6.

Suburbs:\n4. Ohio:\n5. Countryside:\n\nLet's start by eliminating the options that can't be considered \"large villages\", which leave us with \"Rural area\" (B) and \"Countryside\" (E).\n\nWe can now examine the features that distinguish them from large villages. If a rural area is outside a city, then it cannot be a large village.\n\nWe then look at Ohio and note that it cannot be a large villiage because none of its cities have populations of over 100,000. Thus, we know that Ohio (D) cannot be a large village, which leaves us with (E) Countryside.\n\nThe answer is therefore (E) Countriside.\nSo the final choice is E: countrys\n\nInput: What area has a single room where people are working at computers on the floor?

In an office, people work at their computers, and there are multiple rooms. The question is looking specifically for a situation where there are multiple computers in a single room.\n2. A workplace has multiple people working in different rooms. A person might be standing at a computer, but they would be doing so in one room. The question is looking for multiple computers in a single floor space, rather than one room per floor space.\n3. A college does have large rooms with numerous computers, but this isn't the focus of the question. The focus is on the floor rather than the room.\n4. A house is one room per floor space, and it does not contain computers. Thus, it is not relevant for this question.\n5. A place where computers are in one single floor space is called a computer lab or an internet caf\u00e9. They usually have multiple computers available to people who come to use them.", "answer": "D: ohio"}

So again, while \"Fort Knox\", \"church\", or even \"treasure chest\" does not seem like the answer, they are not the final answer either.\n3.

This is not the answer. If they're teaching their students, they're not teaching them something extra.\n3.\"Tell children\" (B) is not the action here. If the activity is teaching the students that they're done preparing for the term, they couldn't be actively teaching children. \n4.\"Opening another box\" (D) is the only one that makes sense because they're opening boxes to do other things with", "answer": "C: open boxes"}
{"idx": 675, "text": "1) It is important to look at each possible answer closely and not jump to a quick conclusion. \n2) We can eliminate some options based on the meaning of the question. \"Make Friends\" (B) is not relevant to the question because socializing does not necessarily have a goal of making friends. \"Mingle\" (C) could potentially be a type of socializing, but it is not necessary because some socialization does not involve mingling.\n3) We can remove two options by understanding the meaning of \"trivial conversations\": \"Small Talk\" (D) refers to having a conversation that is not meaningful or intellectually stimulating, while \"Meeting New People\" (E) is not a conversation-specific term. \n4) Finally, we have left with just two remaining options: A and D.\n5) If we examine A and D individually, we can see that \"make friends\" is not a socializing behavior, but rather a goal of socializing. \"Meet people\" would be an activity within socialization, but that is not what the question asks: it asks about socializing itself. \n6) Therefore, the correct answer is D: trivial conversations.\nSo the final choice is D: trivial conversatio\n\nInput: In what country might I find the highest-earning person? Choices:  a: the U.S. b: Japan c: China d: UK\nOutput: 1)\"Highest earning\" refers to an earnings ranking in a country, so the question is looking for a specific person, not a country ranking. \n2)\"U.S.\" (A) is the short answer, but not the correct answer. \n3)\"China\" (B) has many high income earners but isn't the highest-earning country overall, so the question focuses on the person's earnings and not China's ranking. \n4)\"UK\" is also a good answer choice, but it is not the highest earning country, so it doesn't match the question's requirements. 4)Therefore, the answer is D: China.\nSo the final option is D: the UK\n\nInput: On what continent would you find a tiger?

Choices:  A:\"excellent\" B:\"excellent\" C:\"excellent\" D:\"excellent\" E:\"excellent\"\nOutput: 1.'The first answer, A, is incorrect because \"excellent\" does not mean good. It means, \"the best\".' 2. The second answer, C, is incorrect because \"recommend\" doesn't mean good, it means to \"recommend something as good\". 3. The third answer, D, is incorrect because \"superb\" doesn't mean \"good\", it means \"superior\" or better. 4. The fourth and last answer, E, is incorrect because \"awesome\" doesn't mean 'good', it means \"better than average\" or \"cool\". \n 5.

{"idx": 683, "text": "1.\"What part of the body is lips on?\" Here, \"Lips\" and \"body\" are both nouns and referring to different sections within a body. That means we can quickly determine that the answer is A: mouth or C: all faces because it is not the hands, feet, or body as a whole.\n2. Examine each choice individually. Choice A: mouth. This is incorrect because having lips on everything in your mouth means having them on all of one's teeth, which seems impossible due to how the mouth works.\n3. Choices B and C are the same. Choice C: all faces. This is not correct because all faces have lips, such as when someone smiles happily, and no lips are in the mouth.\n4. That leaves options A (mouth) and D (all hands) left. A mouth contains lips. Hands do not. Therefore, the answer must be A: mouth.\nSo the final answers are either A: mouth or C : All faces\n\nInput: In what city were the Beatles from?

Guide books are one way to learn about a place, and are usually cheap. They will often give you facts about the area and can be a fun read as well. A book is not a way for learning about a place you haven't visited, so it's not an option. Tickets are a good option because you can find out about what to see in that given area, which is usually something you'll know how to get to once you arrive at the destination. Tour operators are not an option because they can only inform you of what to do once you", "answer": "A: mouth"}
{"idx": 687, "text": "1.\"Deaths\" (A) is an inaccurate result. Although this can happen, it is not a sure or direct consequence of hitting someone while driving.\n2.\"Gas\" (E) is not an accurate result because it is not necessarily a direct consequence of driving and hitting someone.\n3.\"May die\" (D) is not accurate because \"may\" implies that death may or may not occur as a result of being hit by a car, but \"will\" implies that death will be the result.\n4. \"Get arrested\" (B) might be an option, but it could also have to do with the person hitting another car while driving, which is a different situation from hitting someone on foot.\n5. \"Moving\" (C) may occur if a person is thrown during the car impact, but again, this isn't a direct consequence of hitting someone when driving.\n6. Therefore, the only accurate result is \"arrest\" (B).\nSo the final answer  is B:arrest\n\nInput:If I want to buy something small but expensive, which of the following places could I go? Choices: 1. A: a convenience store B: grocery store C: online D: drugstore E: dollar store\nOutput:1. \"Dollars store\" (E) is one place you could buy something small but expensive. However, this kind of item would be more easily purchased in a regular or large grocery store.\n2. Online stores can also sell small but expensive items. Amazon, for example, sells jewelry, artwork, and even furniture.\n3. \"Drugstores\" (D) are not typically associated with small and expensive items. They usually stock over-the-counter medications and some other personal care items.\n4. \"Convenience stores\" (A) and \"Grocery stores\" (B) are both good options that can sell small but expensive items as well.\n5. \"Grocery store\" (B) would be a better choice for those wishing to buy a larger quantity of expensive items.\n6. Therefore we can't determine between A&B, so the answer is \"convenient store\" + \"grocery store\"\nSo the final answer: A: convenient store B:Grocery store", "answer": "E: may die"}

Choices: 1. The answer is C: day and night. Day and night occur twice due to the 24-hour cycle, which results in having one occur once before the next after a full cycle.\n2. Choice B: an egg and an apple. An egg and apple occur only once each during the 24-hours cycle; one egg is eaten, and one apple is eaten.\n3.

Of the remaining answer choices, only \"A\" is a verb, so it can't be the answer. The verb \"chop\" would indicate taking something like a chopping knife to the grape. We don't use chop as a noun without an object in front of to chop us a grain of sugar.\n3.) The remaining choice \"B\" makes a grammatical error in that it uses the word \"us\" without any subject, so it can'tdo it. \n4.) \"D\" uses the word \"fruit\" as an adjective rather than a noun, so it is incorrect. \n5.)

This can't be the answer because James would already be in class at the university.\n3. Choices A: university, and C: classroom. These choices can't be the correct answer because James would be studying for his report all night, not going to university the next day. Further, since this choice is implied, James also isn't going to a college class because if he were, he would still be at his university class. \n4. The only remaining choice is Choice B: college class, which has been the most prominent throughout all of the choices. \n5.

It isn't powered by humans because people aren't able to simply \"turn away\" water in this way. \n3C: Have to sleep (D). This isn't human powered because individuals who use this method of water transportation don't have to sleep in order to use it.\n4D: Run (E). Again, option D isn't human-powered because people aren't \"running\" water.\n5B: Let down (C). This satisfies our requirement because to \"let a boat down\" from a body of water into a lake is manual labor which doesn't involve fuel or mechanized power sources. \n6E: Row (B). This also satisfies our requirement because rowing is a manual labor-intensive method of water transportation which doesn't involve fuels or machinery.\n7Then, we compare the two remaining choices. \n8Option E: Row boat. Rowing requires only the labor-intensive work of humans. \n9Option B: Let down.

The only real requirement is a suitcase, which would likely be transportation and therefore, a place that doesn't stay in one location for very long. \n4.)

Because a light year is not a year.\n2. The distance between the earth and the sun (in solar years) is 9.45 light years.\nThis answers the question given the assumptions of the question.\n3. Because it is the distance between a star the earth, and a star from the earth  it does not matter.\n4. That is because it does not contain that word.\n5. That answers the question because it is not the length of the earths year.\n6. This is because it is actually the time and not the distance between stars.\n7. So the answer is D: It is not the distance between earths solar systems.\nSo the final choice is A: because a light year is actually the distance between earths and sun.\nSo the final final answer is A: because a year is not the distance between Earth and the sun.\n\nInput: Choose the verb that describes what an old man is making with a piece of wood.

{"idx": 751, "text": "1: Understand the question first. The key phrase here is \"paper files\", as the question is asking where specific \"paper files\" would be stored. It is not asking where paper files are, in general.\n2: Let's eliminate options that aren't directly related to storing paper files, such as \"filing cabinet\" (E) and \"computer\" (D). When a computer is turned on and files are stored in its hard drive (the storage medium), it is not storing \"paper files\" per say.\n3: \"Drawer\" (B) is an option because it is a part of an office desk and there are paper files stored in desk draws, which is a physical location. However, this location is irrelevant to the specific question of \"what would store paper files\" and therefore cannot be the answer.\n4: The remaining options are \"Office\" (A) and \"Filing cabinet\" (C). Of the two, filing cabinets (C) more directly \"store paper files\". It stores the physical copies of documents such as contracts or invoices, so it more specifically fits the question compared to the broader option of \"office\" (A).\nSo the final answer in O(N)=3 for that section is C: filing cabinet\n\nInput: What kind of computer store monitors online videos?

The phrase \"Having your marijuane in bags help keep what\" refers to the act of putting marijuane in baggies. \n3. This act refers to the following words \"help keep it\" present in the question.\n4. The word \"entertainment\" (A) and \"neat\" (C) refer to people. So this answer cannot be correct.\n5. The other remaining choices are \"happy\" (B), \"intoxicating\" (D), and \"illegal\" (E). \n6. \"Happy\" (B) is simply too broad. Marijuane itself doesn't inherently cause people to be happy, so this answer is incorrect. \n7. \"Illegal\" (E) is also too broad. Some people could certainly be put in jail for having marijuane in their possession, but this does not mean that having marijuane in bills is illegal in every sense, because a simple misunderstanding could lead to someone's arrest and put one in jail. \n8. In conclusion, the answer is \"intoxicating\" which refers to being mentally affected by drugs. Marijuane itself is intoxicating, so it makes sense that smoking marijuane in a bag (A) would help with intoxication and the effect of the drug.\nSo the final is A: intoxicating\n\nInput: I will be a little bit happy due to I'm a little bit scared but it's a little bit ok but it's a lot sad. Choices:   A: not at all B: a little bit C: a little ok D: a lot at all E: very ok F: a lot\nOutput: 1:  Let's examine each choice independently to understand what answer it refers to.\n2:  Choice A: \"Not at all\". First, let's exclude choices that are not numbers. \"Not at all\" is not a number and is an adjective, thus not possible. \"A little bit scared\" and \"it is a little bit sad\" refer to degrees, so the answer cannot be any degree below this. This leaves us with either number \"1\" or number \"2\".\n3.  Choice A is the answer because the sentence", "answer": "B: neat"}

The question seems to be asking what reasons a company would want more funding or publicity.\n2) After investigating the options that don't fit, let's go through each option individually:\n3)\n \"Revealing information\" and \"problems\" are not appropriate answers. While it is true that more money is an answer to more problems, these problems must also be revealed to others first.\n4) If the company is being ridiculed, it is likely trying to get more public support or funding by going public. However, this still does not mean that the company is going public because it is experiencing a problem.\n5) \"Telling all\" seems to be the right choice because it implies that the company wants to tell the world more about itself in order to improve its reputation or to raise money via public investment. In addition, it implies that the company would go public to increase publicity and to get more investors and to spread the information to the world.\n\nSo the final answer was E: telling all\n\nInput:Which option may be involved with a large project? Choices:  C: a manager A: time management B: a contractor D: a builder E: a large-scale project\nOutput: In a nutshell, we should first disqualify the options that don' want to be involved in a huge project.\n1 - \"A contractor\" is not directly related to \"project management\", and a contractor is responsible for executing projects.\n2 - \"A builder\" is not related to managing a large project since building it is not managing it.\n3 - \"Taking a lot of time\" and \"a large-scale project\" do not disqualify managing a large project, as time management does not automatically exclude these.\n4 - A \"project manager\" is the one who organizes a project and executes it. Thus, a project manager is involved with a project, but not necessarily with a large-scale project.", "answer": "D: more funding"}

The \"P\" pattern for Asia excludes all other Asian countries so this answer must be \"East Asia\", which is in Asia, therefore the answer is C: East Asia.\nSo the final  answer is C: East  Asia\n\nInput: A newscaster reports that a well-known person was photographed eating what meal? Choices: \tA: sandwich B: hamburger C: chicken sandwich D: hamburger buns E: apple pie\nOutput: 1: Let's take each option and analyze them and why or why not they are the answer. \n2. Sandwich (A): This is clearly not the answer as it is a plural subject and not a singular one. The sentence is referencing one person in the report.\n3. Hamburger (B): This answer option cannot also be the answer as a hamburger is plural and the report states one person.\n4. Chicken sandwich (C) is an unlikely answer as well because the report states well-known person and chicken sandwich is unlikely to evoke that kind of response. \n5. Hamburger buns (D) may be a possible answer but they are not a meal with one specific person, so they are not a good fit.\n6. Apple Pie (E) could possibly be a possibility since it is possible for one person to eat an apple pie. However, this wouldn't be a well-known person since apple pie is common food that is often eaten. We can disregard this option as well.\n 7.

Choice E: freezer. While a freezer may be associated with KFC, it doesn't provide food and is not a place to eat. \n3) Let's investigate Choice B: plate. A plate can be a restaurant plate or a consumer's dinner plate, but these associations don't match up with the question. \"KFC who serve chicken\" is a professional setting and is more likely referring to restaurant-sized plates for employees to put on the table. \n4) Choices C: bowl and A: fast food restaurant can be eliminated in a similar fashion. Choice C: bowl is not a professional restaurant and Choice A: fast food restaurant is not relevant to the question.\n5) Choice D: freezer is already eliminated previously, so the possibility narrows down to Choice E: oven. An oven may seem relevant, but it doesn't directly involve food. Furthermore, a kitchen oven is an appliance that employees use to bake or prepare food in bulk, which would be unlikely to occur at the start of an employee's lunch break.\n6) Therefore, the answer is E: oven.\nSo the final answers is E: oven", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

Choices: \nA: It is made with modern and traditional materials.\nB: Modern instruments are more complex, but traditional instruments are less complex.\nC: Modern instruments are more simple, but traditional instruments are more complex.\nD: The tuning and sound varies greatly.\nE: The tuning and range vary greatly.\nOutput: The first answer is incorrect because there is no such thing as instruments crafted in traditional or modern materials to modern and traditional instruments. All instruments are made of materials. Option \"B\" is incorrect because modern instruments use modern components to play old styles. Old and new versions of the instruments are still the same version of the instrument, the only difference is that they were made when and they have different parts that are still just the same basic musical instrument. Option \"C\" is incorrect because modern music is more accessible than traditional music. It was invented recently. Options \"D\" is incorrect because the only thing that varies is the tunings and sounds. Option \"E\" is correct because both modern and traditional instruments can have vast differences in tuning and sounds, that is how we can categorize them as modern or traditional.\n\nInput: For his last big exhibition, an art dealer worked hard to arrange an artistic display of objects made by different types of artists.

Let's look at the answer choices to see if they fit the context of the question.\n2. \"Cleared his plate\" (C) is unlikely to occur after the question was already stated.\n3. \"Supermarket\" (E) is mentioned and is likely an incorrect answer, because the context indicates he wanted to avoid the cabbage from spoiling.\n4. \"Put it in the freezer\" (D) is somewhat related, but this doesn't make sense because the context suggests he already had cabbage in the freezer, so this wouldn't help to \"avoid it from spoiling\".\n5. \"On the plate\" (B) fits the context as he did want to avoid the cabbage \"spoiling\" and this would help, but it's technically incorrect because \"put it on the plate\" is not a plausible answer.\n6. \"In the fridge\" (A) is another option that fits the context exactly, but the verb \"in\" indicates this would be a container and \"put it\" is the verb given. Therefore, this is the correct answer.\n7. Thus, the only answer choice that fits the context and has plausible grammar \"In the fridge, he put his empty plate\", is the answer A.\nSo the final Answer is A: In the fridge, he placed it there.\n\nInput:In the book, where did Lori tell us her friend, Sara, had worked?

The key of the question is that the wording is \"in front of\". 2. Let's first understand the options. For example, \"Pen\"(B) is a type of enclosure, but it's too narrow here as \"in front\" can describe a space or item as wide as a fence. \n3. Lastly, eliminating the choices that are too broad or do not have a physical definition. For instance, \"Wall\" (C) describes any type of barrier. Likewise, \"Other horse\" (D) is not specific to what the question is asking for. This leaves us with two reasonable answers: \"Other Fence\" (A) and \"Pen\" (B)\n4. However, \"Other Fence\" is unlikely. We know that there is a \"Fence\", therefore, another \"Fence\" cannot be \"in front\" of the fence.\n5. \"Other horse\" is unlikely. We only have one horse.\n6.

The question, however, doesn't refer to large grapes, which makes A (Picnic Basket) and B (Wine Press) incorrect options. \n2. The other three answers are all correct -- C (Juice), D (Fruit Cocktail), and E (Kitchen). This option set could use some logical elimination to better understand them. We can compare their answers in the following way.\n3. Juice is made with grape squeeze. Small grapes could also be used for grape squeezer but since they are small, there are other fruit juices (like apple, raspberry, etc.) that could also be used. Juice is therefore the incorrect answer. \n4. Fruit Cocktail contains many different kinds of fruit. The term \"cocktail\" is a broad term so not all of its contents have to be grape. Therefore, Frit Cocktail is out. \n5. The same can be said about E (Kitchen). The kitchen is not exclusively a place where grape is used. It also requires various fruits for cocktails and salads and some of these fruits are smaller than grape. Kitchen is therefore incorrect. \n6. In the end, only C, D, and E are correct! \n7.

One might complain, but the security is meant for the house and the people that live in the house, and the security isn't generally targeting the complaining individual. 5) Option D: Terminal.

{"idx": 891, "text": "1) Shoes: In this scenario, wearing shoes would be appropriate. This is because shoes protect your feet from the ground and rain, thus preventing a situation where your feet could be caught and damaged by both elements.\n2) Wet ground: Walking on wet ground may cause you to fall because the ground is wet and slippery and your feet cannot grip it very well. This could cause injury if you were not paying careful attention.\n3) Wet clothes: If you wear wet clothes after the rain, they may lose water and make the ground slippery, leading to an increase in risk that you will fall. Additionally, your clothes may become uncomfortable if they are wet.\n4) Water garden: A water garden typically contains fish, which could potentially eat your feet if they are bare. Walking barefoot after the rain in a water garden would not be advisable.\n5) Start to fall: Walking barefoot after a rain can lead to a dangerous slipping situation because the ground is wet, which makes it hard for your feet to grip it. \n6) Thus, the answer is \u201cDo not walk barefoot after rain, lest you start to fall.\u201d", "answer": "B: wet ground"}

A person with friends would be less likely to be depressed.\n3: C: be alone\n4: E: Have a hobby. We can eliminate options A, B and D as each of them implies that friends (A, depression (B), and alone (C) could be avoided.\n\n5 We narrowed down to three options that describe being without friends.\n\n6 Option C: If a person is really alone they are really isolated and that can be painful both socially and emotionally.\n7 Option E: If a person doesn't have any friends, they probably don't have much to do in their free time. \n8 Option A: No matter how happy someone tries to be, being completely alone and without friends is a sad life.\n9 Option D: With a family, you have friends and people to support you through difficult times.\n10 Combining these choices together we can conclude that being without friends is a life of painful and sad loneliness.\n11 Thus, the answer is option C: be alone.\nSo the final answesr will be: C: be alone (", "answer": "C: health"}

From here, we want to explore the different categories of places where apple trees can be located.\n2. \"In North Carolina\" (B) is one possibility for where an apple tree might be, but a few drawbacks exist. Firstly, apple trees belong to the genus Malus and not the Malum genus, as North Carolina is located within the Malum genus. \n3. While \"In Washington State\" (C) has no scientific drawbacks in its case, it is not specifically related to the question. It does not ask for any specific location within the Malus genus.\n4. Finally, we consider the other answer choices, specifically \"In the Great Outdoors\" (D) and the Garden of Eden\" (E). \"In the Garden of Eden \" is not necessarily a place where we would find apple trees, as the Bible does not describe the trees as being apple trees. Furthermore, \"In the Great Outside\" presents two issues. Firstly, we do not know whether or not apple trees can be found in the Great Outdoors. Secondly, since the question asks about an apple tree and it is not specified if multiple apple trees are present in this environment, it could be any unspecified number and not exactly one apple tree.\n\n5.

Second, bathroom (C) doesn't make any sense, since if she fell over a stuffed animal and there's nowhere on the floor for her to step it makes no sense for her to yell at Billy.\n4.) Thirdly, amusement park (D) is clearly a false option, because she isn't in an amusement park. She might have fallen at an amusement park, but if she tripped over the animal later, then of course she would yell at Billy, since he let a stuffed animal on the floor and she tripped.\n5.) Last, since Billy's mother tripped in a stuffed animal and Billy is a child, it is unlikely she tripped over the stuffed animal by her own doing, so fairgrounds (E) is an improbable answer.\n6.)

Since \"adult people\" are \"people\", they are defined as people of \"adulthood\" - who can be expected to do more things on their own.\n5. This is because adult people can buy, sell, work, own, and have their own house and family. They do not require direction or supervision from others anymore.\n6.

It can be inferred that the man is always working because he is recognised by those that know him as one who is always working. \n2nd Answer: Now the logical part to determine if the choice 1, \"He is never working\" is the correct answer. If a man is always working, he will be recognised to be a man who is always at work. However, since he is always working, the correct answer must be the alternative of choice 1, \"1.

The options are all places where one would find silverware. They are also all places where silverware would be dried once washed.  We can eliminate \"Restaurant\" as being in the wrong place. \"Restaurant\" does not necessarily mean a person's home, which is what would be needed to fit the question.\n5. We can also eliminate \"Restaurant\", because \"Restaurant\" is too vague to be used in the question. It does not have any relevance to finding a place to dry silverware, so there is no need for it in the question at all.\n6.

{"idx": 967, "text": "1: This question asks about the aftermath of receiving a gift. \"Personal\", \"special\", \"rare\", \"offended\" and \"unique\" are all possible responses, but they are all missing some crucial information. \"Personal\" is a descriptor that can apply to any gift. \"Special\" may be used after receiving a gift that the giver chose specifically for the recipient to represent some level of thought and care behind the gift, but it isn't specific. \"Rare\" implies it was special to the person receiving it, but also that it is not common. Similarly, \"offended\" can be applied to any gift, as it indicates an unexpected or unwanted response to what was received. \"Unique\" means that something is different but doesn't imply that the recipient liked it or didn't. Only \"Special\" and \"Rare\" can be used in response to \"what is someone likely to feel\".\n2: \"Special\" and \"rare\" are the possible answers.\n3: To understand \"special\", let's examine the possible options. \"Personal\" could also be labeled \"special\" because it applies solely to the recipient. In response to \"receiving a gift that is not commonly received\", someone may feel \"special\", \"unique\", or \"offended\".\n4: Let's examine \"rare\" to see what sets it apart from the other options. First, \"rare\" can mean uncommon or not likely to be received. It could also mean that someone would feel an emotion such as \"offended\", \"special\" or even \"unique\". It isn't necessary for the gift to be received. \n5: Comparing \"special\" and \"rare\", we see that both words have the same connotation of being uncommonly received. The only exception is that \"special\" may also mean it is given as a personal gift. Although they may both apply, the answer is more likely to be \"rare\".\nSo the final answer would be E:rare", "answer": "A: special"}

To answer this, we'll take a look at the choices carefully and identify what the question is actually asking. \"Who designs a building?\" The keyword here is \"designs\". \n2. When a person \"designs\" a structure, they essentially build it. To elaborate, \"designing\" implies that the person is planning the structure ahead of time, including how all the pieces fit together. Similarly, \"building\" implies a plan, the execution of the plan, and some level of engineering involved. \n3. Excluding options that are unrelated to a building, we can eliminate \"tradesmen\" (E). Tradesmen aren't designers.\n4. \"Driver\" (B) could potentially be a designer, but it seems unlikely given that we would likely need to know what type of car or vehicle they would be driving in order to determine. \n5. \"Fall down\" (E) probably isn't a building for the purposes of our question. \n6. \"Architect\" (D) is a profession focused on designing buildings, so it could be an answer. \n7. \"Builder\" (A) clearly can design a building. They design the structure ahead of time and oversee the execution of the plan.\n8. Therefore, the answer to this is B: builders.\nSo the final answers are A: builders", "answer": "C: architect"}

For example, a Volkswagen Golf is red but the car itself is white.\n3: The phrase \"type of car\" includes the body and the internal workings e.g. engine etc. So we would say \"type of car with a red engine would be red.

{"idx": 987, "text": "1.\"I'll take home a paycheck that my salary will determine.\" 2. A person who wants to make better money must consider three aspects: their job, their home, and their money.\n3. The job aspect requires the correct job and compensation. However, it's impossible to change a job without moving to a different company (at least in today's job market), and that would be quite expensive.\n4. The home aspect includes the possibility of moving houses, but if a raise at one's job would require moving houses then it doesn't make sense to apply for a new job first.\n5. The money aspect involves taking on additional work on the side to make more without changing jobs, but this would take significant effort and would not produce a stable enough income.\n6. Therefore, a person looking to increase their pay must consider the saving money option. They want more, but they don't want to change a lot.\n7. To make more money, the person must consider how they are currently earning money and how they can expand on this without putting much effort in.\n8. In this case, it makes the most sense to ask about a person who wants to make money by working more, not less. \n9. Choice A: own house. Making more money would enable a person to obtain a bigger house, but this would still require a lot of effort and would not necessarily directly lead to better pay.\n10. Choice B: better job. Better jobs will pay more, which would be the preferred action to take in this scenario.\n11. Choice E: feel safe. A person who wants more and will work for more only will feel like they're working more.\n12. Choice C: win lottery. While it would be possible for a person to win the lottery, if they were to be unable to continue their current work then it wouldn't make much difference.\n13.

But it doesn't say how to know whether the car is dirty. Thus, eliminate.\n3) For Choice B: we have a sentence \"you will be able to see grime\". Does this mean the car is dirty? No, it says \"you will be able (when driving) to see grime\". Thus, it is irrelevant.\n4) For Choice D: windows will smell like \"lots of dirt\". This is not a way to know that your car is dirty. Thus only Choice E: you will see that your upholstery (inside car) is filthy.\n5) As for the final answer, there is only Choice E. You don't always see if \"an\" object is dirty. It has to be a verb.

If, for example, some people on a desert island are visiting the city to watch a baseball game, then we could not say Sammy wanted to go where the people were, as that would be a city, specifically.\nThat leaves only choice C for the actual answer. If Sammy wants to go where the people are, then presumably he does not want to go where no-one is, which is the desert.

Choices:  \"A\" is the correct answer because \"B\" is a strategy which may be used to achieve various goals, but it may cause one to lose interest in the process. \n\n\"C\" is not the correct answer because this would only be effective if one already knew what their goals were.\n\"D\" is not the correct choice because this would only be helpful in the event that one were able to meet all the demands of their goals.\n\"E\" is not the correct option because this would only be the case if one did not have the ability to control one's environment or emotions.\n\nSo the answer is A: B: Be clear about what is being accomplished with goals, whether the goals are short-term or long-term.\n\"D\" and \"E\" are not correct because they require that you actually know what your goals are, which is not the case for this example.\n\"C\" could work as long as you know what you're trying to achieve and can control your own emotions and environment in order to do so.

This is because while a solar eclipse affects the light available to the earth, it does so continuously. It does not take place in one brief moment, unlike other planetary events.\n3.)

The question does not ask the name of the restaurant or any other details, so the answer should be as general as possible.\n2. Let us look at the answer choices, we could eliminate them one by one.\n3. Choices A & B are not suitable because they are both on the East Coast of North america so their answers overlapping.\n4. Choices C and E are not suitable because they only provide a general feature of the restaurant (beach town with ocean and coastal city). We can conclude that the actual seafood restaurant may not be located here but they are potential placements.\n5. Choice D is appropriate because the East coast of North America has many coastal cities and some of them have seafood restaurants.\n6. The answer is Option D: coastal city.\nSo the final answers is D: beach town\n\nInput: If an egg is in a basket, can I say I have eggs?

To figure out where Jame's feet were standing, you need to think about whether the sun is directly over the ground.\n2.

Similarly, Jame's feet wouldn't be burned if they were on a windowsill, as this object doesn't typically cause hot burns.\n4. Another clue is that the sun shining directly down doesn't typically happen during the winter, because it's cold outside. On a summer day, the sun is hot and will likely burn Jame's feet.\n5.

{"idx": 58, "text": "1, \"What is the only way to recover from exhaustion?\"\n2. \"Meditate\" is not the answer. Meditating will not help a person recover from exhaustion.\n3. \"Have rest\" is an action and therefore cannot recover from exhaustion. To recover from exhaustion, a person must first become exhausted in order to gain something from the experience.  \n4. \"Go to sleep\" is a place, but this doesn't really provide evidence for how something becomes better after sleep.\n5. The answer must be \"stay in bed,\" which will cause the necessary exhaustion so that you can then recover from it.\n6.

A beaver could build its lodge within a millpond, but this would not necessarily affect the functionality of any nearby machines.\n4. Option E: Lake or river. Lake and river water levels can rise and fall, but this does not directly affect the functionality of any machines. \n5. Option D: Ontario. A beaver wouldn't necessarily choose to build its lodge in Ontario unless there were an abundance of food or shelter there that they were looking for and didn't find in a nearby location.\n6.

Looking at the choice remaining, \"the band\", we know that this is the most applicable answer because in a band, there will often be musicians sharing one instrument.

The first is by walking or being carried - that is, not by flying. This eliminates Options B, D, and E. We can also eliminate Option A because geese are not carried by people in a typical situation. The second way to get from one place to another is to fly.

This is not the correct answer at all because being sick and staying in the bed isn't an accurate description of resting.\n4  Choice B: sleep more. This is an unlikely answer because of the specific verb choice \"staying\". Additionally, the choice is too extreme because one could easily make up for any missed sleep and staying in bed does not actually equate to sleeping more.\n5. Choice C: bed sores. This is also not the answer because a sick person likely wouldn't be up enough to develop bed sores.

However, this particular event didn't seem to be a particularly important event, so missing it could be considered missing out or not missing out, which leaves this choice ambiguous.\n7 Choice E: comfort. This is almost certainly not the correct answer because a person could be sick and still feel comfortable. Furthermore, comforting someone isn't usually an event; it's an action or relationship.\n8. Lastly, we consider the only remaining answer option (C), which is the correct answer because being sick and stayin g in bed does indeed cause bed sores. \n9.

Here, we know that \"Sally lost her kit because she wasn't watching what she was doing, and she let go of the string.\" This indicates that Sally didn't hold onto the string (the object she lost), and as a result, she lost her kite. \n3. Let's take a closer look at the options and determine which one matches best.\n4. Answer choice (B) makes sense- something would have to slip out of Sally's hand for her to lose the string and her kite.  However, the only thing that slips out of her hand is the string, not the kite.\n5. Similarly, answer choice (A), \"The child's hand\", doesn't make sense. If the string slipped out of Sally' hand and she lost the kite, it would have to be because the child reached out and grabbed the string, but answer choice (A) doesn't support this.\n6. Let's take one more look at choice (E). \"Toy store\" is a place where one can get a kite, but the kite is the object that's being used. It's not the string. \"End of line\" is also a location that is related to getting kites, but the reason is because kites are usually available from a store, but the store is not. The string is also not being used, so it doesn't make sense as an answer.\n7. That leaves us with choice (D), \"The last straw\". We see in Sally's case that she lost her kite because the string accidentally slipped out of her hand. This means that the string is the kite, and therefore, the \"last straw\".\n8. Thus, the answer choice is D: The Last Straw.\nSo the final option is D: The Last straw\n\nInput: What is the only thing that a pencil needs to draw? Choices: 1.

We can immediately eliminate all the answers that are not in the United States. \"Denmark\" is in Europe and does not fit the context of the question, and similarly \"United States\" is in North America.\n9: Thus, the correct answer is \"East coast of the United States, such as Florida\", as that is the only option that fits the context of where east coast areas are found. (C)\nSo the final answer East coast of the United States is D: Map\n\nInput: What does the word \"inventory\" refer to? Choices: 1. A: books\n2. B: money\n3. C: food\n4. D: work\n5. E: toys\nOutput:1: Let's examine each choice closely.\n2: Option B: \"Money\". No, as \"inventory\" is used to refer to other things than money, eg a store's inventory, or a company's inventory.\n3: Option C: \"Food\". No, as you are more likely to find inventory in business settings than at grocery stores or in homes, whereas the question specifically asks for \"inventory\". \n4: Option D: \"Work\". No, work is another thing that you are unlikely to find inventory for, whereas \"inventory\" is more likely to be found in a warehouse or in a catalogue.\n5: Option E: \"Toys\".  No, toys are more likely to be called toys instead of inventory, whereas inventory is used to describe more practical items. \n6: Therefore, the correct answer is 1: Books\nSo the final answer Books\n\nInput: What do we do at home?

{"idx": 130, "text": "1) When we listen to music, it can cause us a range of emotions.\n2) To answer the question, we must rule out all of the emotions that listening to music, by itself, would not bring about. \n3) Happiness (A): If we are happy, we wouldn't need music. We could be happy even if there is no music, so this is not the proper answer.\n4) A smile (B): A smile is a facial expression that is brought on by a range of emotions ranging from happiness to boredom. We could listen to music and smile, regardless of the style. \n5) Calm (C): If we are calm, we wouldn't listen to music because we would feel too relaxed and not want to be surprised by any sudden loudness.\n6) Entertainment (D): We could listen to music without entertainment since music is simply an audio recording and we wouldn't need to be entertained. A movie, however, could entertain us without any music. \n7) Relaxation (E): Music could help us relax, but it is not the only way. For instance, getting a massage would relax us in addition to music.\n8) Therefore, the answer is D: entertainment. Music, when played or sung, entertains us and can make the time pass by more enjoyably compared to just listening to the radio or having the TV on in the background.\nSo the final conclusion is A: entertainment\n\nInput: What might you expect to see in a theater if you were attending a play?

If you were to take a math problem that had text that was not about numbers or solving a problem, then it is not a math problem. As a sample problem, take, for example, \"Apples from a tree are falling and three fall every 2 minutes.\" In this case, the problem is not with numbers, but simply with an action occurring based on time.\n3.\"The garden center is a place where you can buy apple trees, apples, strawberries, or any other items that have to do with gardening. You could find apples in the garden center.\"\n4. To understand what a garden center is, take a look at the dictionary definition. A \u201cgarden center\u201d is a store that sells items related to landscaping, including \u201cgarden furniture, plants, and decorations as well as seeds, fertilizers, and chemicals.\"\n5. By definition, the garden center is not an apple tree, so it cannot be the answer.\n6. Similarly, a park is not an apple tree so it can not be the answer.\n7. A coloring book is not an answer because it is a book where you can color different pictures, but does not include an apple tree.\n8. Gravity is a mathematical concept that describes how a physical object might fall through the air, but it does not describe the behavior of one apple falling from an apple tree.\n9.

Investing on stock market 4. Buying clothes 5. Paying for college degree Output: 1. This answer is not correct since dining out or eating food at the restaurant is neither good nor bad. It's simply a way of spending money. 2. This answer is also not correct, since gambling can be good or bad. We cannot rule out that some people earn money by gambling. 3. This answer is also incorrect, since investing on the stock market can sometimes lead to profit and sometimes to loss. Therefore, investing alone is neither good nor bad, so the entire phrase is invalid. 4. This answer is true, since buying clothes is a waste of money, but not always and the phrase is invalid. 5. This question is ambiguous. If paying for a college degree means paying a large amount of money, then it is a waste of money (since it's better to get a free college degree through hard work). If paying for a degree refers to paying for the degree itself (via tuition fees), then it is not necessarily a waste of money (depending on the cost of it, which can be sometimes quite high).

{"idx": 154, "text": "1.'Not even what' can be answered in two ways: \n2. 'Not even what' could be answered by saying that there are more significant issues in the economy. Therefore, this might be a valid way to answer the question, because even though inflation could be a problem in the economy, it is not the most significant problem and therefore it is considered negligible.\n3. On the other hand,'Not even what' could also be answered by saying that inflation is so negligible that it isn't even worth fighting. For example, if inflation were 0.1 percent, it would not be worth the effort to fight it because the cost of doing so would outweigh the benefit. \n4. However, this second meaning would not be correct in this case because inflation must be above 0 to be considered noticeable or even worth fighting. Therefore, the first meaning is the correct response. \n5. We can conclude that the answer is 'Not even what' because the second meaning is inapplicable to this situation and the first meaning is the only correct way to answer the question.\nSo the final conclusion is the answer is A: not even what\n\n### A. How to answer the Turing Test:\n\nTuring test was proposed by Alan Turing in a paper in the 1950s. The test is a method of machine evaluation, in which a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with two computers, one of which is a human-like program and the others are more limited programs, in an attempt to distinguish to which is a human and which is a machine.\n\nThe Turing test is a method of evaluating a chatbot or virtual assistant: the computer program attempts to have a conversation with a human, and the test is successful if the human judge cannot distinguish whether the program is talking to them or another human being. \n\nThe Turing Test measures the ability of an artificial agent to communicate with humans and be indistinguishable from humans. It is a means of evaluating artificial intelligence. The original version of the test required the program to respond to the human using natural language, much like a human being would do, without human supervision or prior input. \n\nTo pass the Turing Test, a computer should be able to communicate with a person in a way that would never reveal that it was a machine.

We can consider train station as a place which contains more phone calls, but the phone call may be related to train station, like calling with train schedule, buying train ticket or just pick up/send off phone call near the station.

Option A: \"Wedding\" cannot be the answer because in a wedding, there are many places one could wear a white shoe. \n\nb. Option B: \"Tennis\" cannot be the answer either because in tennis, tennis shoes must be dark while white shoes are considered to be for formal wear. \n\nc. Option C: \"Left foot\" cannot be the answer as it is an instruction to put the white shoe on a foot instead of a place.\n\nd.

However, B, \"I'm not going to have any homework tomorrow.\" is not relevant to the question. This might be true at some point, but it does not pertain to it being homework that we did not get done, but homework that was not brought home with us.\n3. C, \"I don't have any problems with my homework!\" again could be right at one point, however, it is not saying that you did not do your homework, but rather, you have done it all. \n4. D, \"I did my homework!\" would be right. Similarly to choice B above, this would mean that we did indeed do our homework, but would be incorrect for the case in which we did not do it.\n5. E, \"It.\" is incorrect because the question is phrased in regards to completed homework and the answer is not an object.

These choices both require a man to dress, \nbut \"Dress herself\" requires an action performed by the man on his own body, while \"Drink beer\", a drinking activity, \ndoes not directly pertain to readying the man to work.\n6.

Based on the information known, the most likely place for giraffes to live is option \"C\", however option \"C\" is incorrect due to a flaw in its reasoning.

Idaho is located far away from large cities and it is not as widely populated as other states.\n4) Option B: The Shopping Mall. This option is not the best because shopping malls are not always directly associated with one particular store. For example, one shopping mall could contain multiple stores all with different brands.\n5) Option C: Big City. This is another option that we would eliminate because a big city is not the best place. Some cities may have a high population, but this doesn't necessarily help in this scenario. In fact, a smaller city could have more potential customers.\n6) Option D: In Town. This is not the correct answer here either because, to maximize the number of customers, building a department store in a specific location in town would not be ideal.\n7) The last option we need to investigate is option E: New York.

Choices: \nA: behind the tree B: on the other side of the tree C: underneath the tree D: above it\nOutput: 1] The question is asking to identify where the runners need to stand in order to be able to see the runners circling the tree.\n2] As runners are visible as a result of their own movement and not the movement of the tree, we must evaluate which of the four given locations (standing behind it, standing on the other side of it, standing underneath the tree, and standing above it) provides the view of the runners' movement that the people seeking their location are looking for.[3]\n3] The answer will be either 'behind the tree' (A) or 'above the tree' (D).[3]\n4] 'Standing behind the tree' (A), i.e. positioning oneself on the side of the circle away from the tree (i.e. between the line connecting the two ends of the circle and the tree, does not provide the best view of the runners because the people see only a glimpse of the runners (the glimpse being the portion of the runners' circle that is located above the line connecting these two ends of the circle).\n5] In contrast, 'Standing above the tree' (D)", "answer": "E: menu"}

{"idx": 266, "text": "1. To begin understanding the question, first let's separate all the nonsense choices: D: front door. Although a dog barking at the front door might happen, it is not the focus of the story. C: classroom. Even if a dog barks at someone in a classroom, there is not an expectation with this question that the window plays a role in how someone will react. E: window. This is a non-essential part of the story.\n2. A front window is near a door, whereas a front door does not have a window. A dog running to a door doesn't necessarily mean it's for an expected presence because a house might have something inside that needs to be accessed through the door. Thus, the best answer choices would be A: building (near the door) versus B: friend's home (no door)\n3. B: friends home. The dog running to the front window is more likely to be barking at something it senses in the house, such as someone coming home. B: friend's household. There is no indication of a presence in the house outside the window, but the dog barked to alert the resident.\n4. A: building, where the presence could be outside or inside and the dog could bark to alert a resident or an outsider or someone unexpected. Alternatively, C: Classroom. The dog can be alerting the house for a resident or someone unfamiliar, such as a seller, potential burglar, delivery person, family member coming back.\n5. B: a friend's house. The presence could be the dog owner, a visitor, or someone unexpected, but the dog is alerting a friend or resident.\n6. There is no explicit mention that the dog barked because of a presence, this is a more abstract concept than the story is presenting. Moreover, it is more likely that the dog barking is because it is uncomfortable alone and wants companionship or doesn't like the unknown presence outside. The dog barked because someone was at the window.\nSo the final answers are A: building and C: classroom\n\nInput:What is a person eating when he is chewing?

In addition, a suitcase is not ideal for keeping a digital file because it can be destroyed by water and suffers from poor storage organization.\n3) Options \"Filing cabinet\" (B) and \"desk drawer\" (D) also cannot be the answer.

Thus, the guys were having _____ fun.\n2: Therefore, the correct answer is having ____ fun.\n3: The options provide clues that might be the right answer. \n4: However, after looking closely at each choice, we can eliminate some. \"Dance\" is the wrong answer. Jimmy would not like these guys because they were dancing. Also, \"getting drunk\" does not make sense because this would not be the primary attraction of the party.\n5: \"Meet new people\" is incorrect. The guys were having fun even though Jimmy believed otherwise since he was the only one there who was not having fun.\n6: Next, we take a look at \"Having fun.\"  This is the correct answer since having fun is all the guys were doing.\nSo the final choice is D: having fun\n\nInput: The teacher gave a project due in two days, but not all students could finish by then.

{"idx": 286, "text": "1: The problem with A's statement is that it is a sign of growing older, which is a likely result of living for more than 20 years. The shuttering, perspiration, and palpitations mentioned in B, C, and E are symptoms of fear, stress, and anxiety; which are not the same as the fear of dying.\n2. B's statement refers to the biological reproduction of new life. Therefore, it cannot be an indication that we are not living.\n3. To rule out choices C and D, we need to first determine if they are signs that we are not living, or signs of when we are living. Palpitations and perspiration can occur during a number of life-affirming activities, such as athletic competition, sexual activity, or eating spicy foods.\n4. When we have eliminated the first three choices and are left with the remaining three, we must examine them in more detail.\n5. Let's look at E, and answer the question by posing another: \"What is a sign that I might be living soon?\"\n6. This tells us that D is the only choice where we may be living soon, and therefore E is not a valid choice.\n7. Now we can examine the remaining four options, and eliminate any that are not signs that show we are living.\n8. Of these four remaining options, there are only two that are possible indications that we might be living soon: palpitations and perspiring.\n9. Looking at palpitations first, this could indicate fear and stress during life-threatening or life-affirming situations.\n10. Let's consider the other option: perspiration. Perspiring might occur during a number of lifesaving or life-affirmative activities.\n11. Finally, we consider choice B's answer \"reproducing\" again, which can refer to the biological reproductions of new life.\n12. So what remains are E (palpitations) and B (reproduction).\n13. B is the only answer choice that does not indicate that we may be living soon. Therefore, the answer must be B: reproduction, not E: palpitations.\nSo the final answers is B: reproduction", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

Choice A: \"Good health\" is a good benefit, but it's too specific. \n4. Choice D: \"Rest\", is a good thing, but it's not \"great\", since it's not a benefit to exercising.\n5.

A roller coaster would not be found in a farm or a business district, meaning that there is no need to worry about using a parking lot in those locations. 2) That leaves car parking lots near amusement parks, car parking lots near urban areas, and car parking lots near farms. 3) Car parking lots near urban parts of cities will almost never have a roller coaster in the vicinity. An amusement park may be close to the car parking lot, but that would be unlikely given the size of cities and space constraints. 4) Given this, we can eliminate one possibility. Car parking lots in cities and the near vicinity are unlikely to feature a roller coater.\n5) Car parking lots in a farm area would not have a roller coater in the vicinity.\n6) That leaves the option that is most similar to where this car parking spaces can be located. 7) Car parking lots at amusement parks near a roller coater are the only choice that satisfies the requirements of the question.\nSo the final answers is A: Car parking lots near an amusement park\n\nInput:  When you begin to work on a job interview, what is the first thing you need to do?

You wouldn't expect a bullet to be found in a battle field or a musuem. \n2) You might say \"A\", \"B\", \"D\", or \"E\" but this is incorrect. These cannot all be related to a bullet that is in a war because canons and tornadoes do not fire bullets. \n3) Thus, let's examine each choice independently and use logical reasoning to eliminate potential answers. \n4) First, \"C\" cannot be the answer to the question because weapons don't fire bullets. A bullet is a projectile meant specifically for combat. \n5) Next, let's examine if a bullet can be found in \"A\" - the Battlefield - but this will be ruled out. Consider this: a bullet is a kind of projectile but it is not fired from a cannon, nor is it fired into the air. While the battlefield is the home of projectiles, as we mentioned before, it is not the home of bullets. \n6) We now examine \"E\". The answer \"E\" is the only answer that makes logical sense of the choices available. Bullets flying through the air as a result of a storm might be a scenario in war. While not every bullet is fired during storms, there is an argument to be made that bullets fired during storms would be found on a battlefield, perhaps as a result of a battle in the storm. \n7) Thus, the correct answer is \"E\" - The Battlefield.\nSo the final answers is E: battle field", "answer": "A: battle field"}

Instead, the notice would be placed directly on the target audience.\n3. \"Conference\" (C) is probably not the answer because it isn't the place where the notice would likely be found. It would be placed on a target audience.\n4. \"Classroom\" (D) doesn't work because it isn't likely to occur.\n5. \"Refrigerator\" (E) is the wrong choice because a refrigerator is not a place where the notice is most likely to be found. It is likely to be found directly on the target audience and not somewhere where the target audience would be less frequent. \n6. That leaves us with choice A: front door.

If a priest were trying to stop liberal behavior, this behavior would not be present in the first place.\n3. \"Recalcitrant\" (C) is a word that can refer to a rebellious attitude, and this is a key word. However, the word used is \"behavior\", which is plural, so it would more likely refer to a specific act of rebellion than a blanket attitude towards the topic.\n4. \"Heretical\" (D) is a word we've already eliminated in the first question, so it's not the right answer.\n5. \"Heretical\", however, is a recurring word that is found to describe the behaviors that the priest pushes against.

This means that we cannot be in the space shuttle (D), so the correct answer is (B) air. 6) If you are having trouble understanding, think about where oxygen is most likely to be.

'Playing' may be the first action that comes to mind, but it's the appropriate one. 'Playing' occurs in video game stores.\n2: It's not necessary to play a game to purchase it. We also know that this is where people go to browse and shop. 'Gaming,' on the other hand, falls more in line with leisure time, making it an inappropriate answer choice.\n3: We also don't think we're ever going to see someone actually \"working\" in a video game store, outside of maybe a store manager, who doesn't have much time to game.\n4: Finally, some of these tasks, even if they weren't the focus of the scenario, wouldn't necessarily be considered \"unusual.\" For example, \"browsing\" could be expected in this case, especially for people who have long standing relationships with their local video game store.\n\n5: Let's take a closer look at the remaining options:\n6: We've eliminated answer choices S, B, D, and E, and we know we're talking about inaction, not the action taken by the person in this hypothetical case. It's safe to assume they're not buying anything or working for the location.\n7: The answer to \"Which action would you NOT expect to find in a VIDEO GAME STORE?\" doesn't necessarily mean that we think it", "answer": "A: cold"}

{"idx": 358, "text": "1: Let's look at what each part makes. Jigsaw puzzles have many pieces. Chess has many pieces. Puzzle boxes only have one piece (the puzzle that it holds). Jigsaw puzzle puxes have a few pieces; one to turn the box, another to pull the puzzle out, and maybe one or two to open the box.\n2. Jigsaw puzzle puxxes may have one or a few pieces, but they're not the only item necessary to play them. Each puzzle needs the puzzle itself, a picture on the box, and a sheet with the solutions.\n3. All of this makes jigsaw puzzle puxxes and puzzle boxes very easy to answer.\n4. But chess has to be considered carefully. The only piece in chess is the board itself. However, it requires 8 pieces (each representing a different type of army) to play: the kings, the queens, the rooks, the bishops, the knights, the pawns, plus the board.\n5. It's also necessary to know other aspects to play chess. First, each piece has a unique color, so there are 8 colors (two for each player) involved. The board has two sides (one for each player), so four sides. The pieces have 16 sides (eight angles on a board from four directions on each side) which gives us 16 pieces.\n6. Jokes and riddles can be made with 58 pieces and more. However, if the riddle asks for the total number of pieces that are needed to make it, you would be incorrect if you only consider the number of pieces in the joke and overlooked the other factors.\n7. Thus, neither of these answers is correct.\n8. Option C: Puzzles have many pieces, making it the option that has the most pieces. Puxxes only have a few pieces, making option D incorrect.\n9. Option A: Jigsaw puzzles are easy to answer because they only require one piece, whereas chess and puzzle boxes require more. The only remaining option is B: Jigsaw puzzle.\n10. So, the answer is B: Jigsaws puzzles.\nSo the final answered is B: Jigsawa puzzles", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

Therefore, it doesn't necessarily make sense to say \"inland\". \n2. B: On mountains. While some places on high-altitude mountains such as Mount Everest have no sun, you cannot actually experience the beach on that mountain. \n3. C: On a boat or in a boat. While sailing on the ocean may provide some relief from the sun, it is still very likely that you would see or feel the sun on these objects. \n4. D: On the moon or in a space shuttle.

{"idx": 374, "text": "1.\"Where would you put a Dictionary while using it?\" This means to think about where you'd put your dictionary next to it while reading it. Firstly, a dictionary is a book. You can put it on a table if it isn't being used. Or else, you can put it under your desk where you'll need it. In the library, dictionaries are often placed on shelves or tables. Classrooms often have dictionaries on tables, but they're not always used for dictionary usage.\n2. Consider this scenario: Whenever you use a dictionary, where do you put it so that it's handy? First, let's take a look at places where dictionaries aren't usually found. A shelf is usually used to store books. A study area is where you study, not where you put your dictionary. A classroom has a teacher and students, not a dictionary. A table is an item you use for other things like eating or writing. \n3. You put your dictionary somewhere other than where you'd use it. You can place your dictionary next to you while reading it so that you can turn the pages or highlight things. However, a shelf is not ideal for this as you'd need to walk over to the shelf to access it, which would break your concentration while reading. \n4. Therefore, the best option would be \"table\" (D), as this is where you'll usually find a dictionary when studying for exams.\n5. This means that you can usually find dictionaries on classroom tables as well, but not all dictionaries are used for exam-related activities, and most of the times they're used for reference purposes rather than reading.\n6. In addition to classroom tables, dictionaries can also usually be found on shelves in the library for study purposes. So the answer is either \"table\" (D) or \"classroom table\" (E) depending on your intended usage of the dictionary.\nSo the final answers are either D: table or E: Classroom table\n\nInput: Where is it likely to be windy on a beach?

The first thing to note is that an enemy is a person who has taken up arms against or is trying to harm another person or persons. Arrogation and abandonment (B) are not the same as \"taking up arms\", hence the negative of \"abandon\".\n3. Option \"D\" is definitely not abandonment. \"Embracing\" is not defined in the sentence and neither is \"engaging\" (E), so they are also not the answer. \n4. Next, we'll eliminate option B because arrogation (A) makes no sense since engagement (E) is already a direct translation of \"the fight\".\n5. Finally, we are left with two words: arrogate (B) and retain or keep (C). Because arrogation is not stated in the context or as a positive action, we will keep or retain (C), which is similar to \"engagement\" (E), but it is not stated in the passage.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question can be answered as \"keep or retain (C)\".\nSo the final answer we got is C:", "answer": "E: engage"}

{"idx": 458, "text": "1) Begin by understanding what the opposites mean. There are two opposites given: fearless and fearful. According to the dictionary, the adjective of fearless is bravery, and the adjective after fearful is ferocious. \n2) We've identified several options for the opposite of fearless.\n3) Let's start with brave. Brave is an adjective that means courageous or fearless. If brave is associated with fearlessness, it must be an opposite, which doesn't make sense. \n4) What about ferocious? This is another adjective that can mean strong or aggressive and it is an opposite of fearful, so it could be the opposite of fearlessness. But if we look at a few examples, we find that it's not quite right. The English sentence \"I'm afraid that ferocious dogs are being bred back into the wild.\" might be the same as \"I'm afraid a ferocious dog is being bred back into an environment that it belongs to.\" We wouldn't describe dogs as ferocious unless they were in the wild, but we would still consider them feared or fearless. Similarly, \"the cat was ferocious in his defense\", could be rephrased as \"the cat was fearless in his defense\".\n5) We find that neither brave nor ferocious are correct answers because they don't describe the opposite of fearless-ness.\n6) Let's consider english carrier. This could also be the opposite of fearful, but it does not describe the opposite of fear-less-ness as we would describe someone who is not afraid of English-speaking jobs.\n7) Considering what we know, the opposite could not be english carrier.\n8) Let's examine another option - achromatic. The opposite of \"white or lacking color\" is not a desirable quality in a human. It doesn't match the required description, and the word \"colorless\" also doesn't appear in the set of options. \n9) We find that achromatic is not correct because it doesn't describe the adjective opposite to color-less.\n10) That leaves us with the answer D- \"the answer is Brave\".\nSo the final answer was Brave\n\n# Import all data into the file: data", "answer": "A: fearless"}

Answer B: see light: This choice is not necessarily wrong, but not the most direct answer either.

Answer C: fill with tears: This is not an option because when an infant's eyes open for their first time, this does not directly mean they \"fill with tears\". \n9. Answer D: be happy: This is incorrect because newborns can't think about happiness or sadness, so choosing this answer wouldn't logically reflect an infant's first thought when their eyes opened. \n10. Answer E: glass over: While this could be a possibility, it's not the most prominent answer. This is because most newborns won't have the muscle capacity in their eyes to cause blinking yet. Thus, there is a higher chance that they won't \"glass over\" when they open their eyes.\n11. Answer B may be a more direct possibility, but it still doesn't hold as much significance as the correct answer does. The correct answer is A: Newborn babies' eyes are closed the first time they open them because they lack the muscle control to open their eyes fully. When opening their eyes for the very first time, newborns may not be able to immediately see the light. This is because light is an observable phenomenon and newborns may not yet have developed the muscle coordination to see it. Newborns don't \"fill with tears\" or \"glass over\" because this requires more muscle control than a newborn baby can likely do the first time they open their eyes. Instead, newborns will likely just stare at whatever's around them.

So the only time you would expect to see humor make someone happy is when they're happy at first and then they get surprised or have an unexpected happy ending.\n*Another important thing to note is that humor makes people happy because they know what is happening (they expect it, so it's not a surprised happy ending).

This is also not addiction and not headaches.\n7) Choice B: Fatigue is not the answer, because fatigue does not make someone shake, tired does.\n8) David hasn't had something he needed for a long time, so choice C: Relaxation is not the answer. Furthermore, stress and relax would make more sense together.\n9) As previously stated, addiction and headaches are not the answers.\n10) Choice D: Headache is not the answer, since David is not specifically referencing headache, and stress and relaxation do not make you feel shakey.\n11) The last possibility is choice E: overeating, or eating too much.

A napster is a type of music player.\n5: Next, lets look for categories that are not directly related and discard those options\n6: Options A, B, and C are not directly related to a music category.

Option C: A big town could be somewhere the billionaire attended college, but it's equally possible it's somewhere else. There's no specific location mentioned and it's not required. Therefore, this can be eliminated as an answer.\n5. Option D: A big city is also a location, however, there is no description of it's \"science\" portion. In fact, the \"big\" part of the answer could mean a smaller town, so there is no reference to the question of a big city. \n6. Option E: This is a building like a bank, however, there is nothing about the \"building\" that explains the \"science,\" it's simply a building.\n7. This lets us know that the true answer must be something that is not about an office building, but a building in general. A big city or big town is not the answer because it could be any size. The only remaining answer that fits this is the \"building\" of \"bank.\" \n8.

A cat does drink water, but they may not drink water every day. Also, there are other places a cat could drink water aside from its home, making the answer choice too broad to be correct.\n4) Choice C: need food is an ineffective answer and may be incorrect. It is true that cats need food, but the answer choice is focused on what cats do daily. \n5) Choice D: annoy is likely incorrect. A cat can annoy people daily, but it is not something a cat must always do, and other events could possibly be more correct.\n6) Choice E: play is likely incorrect because a cat can play every day and this is the most direct answer choice.\n7) Lastly, let's evaluate choice E: play and conclude that it is the best answer because that is what cats actually do daily.\nSo the final answers is E: play\n\nInput: Where does water go every day?

Choices:  C: wounded A: patients in hospital B: deaths in hospital C: not serious injuries D: medical conditions E: recoveries\nOutput: 1: \"Casualties\". This is a word that can refer to both wounded and dead victims of a catastrophe or war.

Option A: This is not the answer since \"beast\" is the meaning of \"monster\", not a nickname. \n3. Option B: This could be a nickname, but it is not one for \"the monster the beauty loved\". While \"ugly\" could be an informal nickname for a monster, it isn't the answer since it is too general and the question is not referring to an \"ugly\" monster. Furthermore, since the beauty loved the monster, she probably wouldn't call it \"ugly\", meaning that such a nickname would most likely be unreliable. \n4. Option C: While \"ugliness\" could be considered a nickname for the monster, it is too generic and \"the beauty loved\" implies that there is a specific, unique nickname for the monstrous being. \n5. Option D: There is no way a satellite could be nicknamed \"beauty\" for the same reasons presented above regarding the book's genre. \n6. Option E: This is not a suitable nickname since this would be the actual nickname. Therefore there would be no need for an answer regarding \"the monster the beast loved\". This is a redundancy.\n7.

For this reason, it is also not an acceptable answer (\"D\").\n3) Let's now eliminate the answer choices which are not feelings. \"Empowering\" is the empowerment of self, so it is not a feeling. \"Sadness\" is a type of feeling, but it is the wrong kind; it refers to a sadness or despair of one's own circumstance, not in having accidentally hurt someone else.\n4) Therefore, we are left with \"Regret\" or \"Empowering\" which are the two correct answer choices.\n5) Thus, the answer is Regret.\nSo the final answers are Regret\n\nInput: What might cause someone to feel as if the ground is getting further away from them?

{"idx": 578, "text": "1) There are a large number of locations in a city. It is important to remember that while the question refers to trash cans, it does not say specifically where \"in the city\" they are. \n2) Let's eliminate the inappropriate answers first. \"Park\" (B), \"Motel\" (C), \"Corner\" (D), \"Bus stop\" (E), and \"Store front\" (E) each have the words \"in the city\", but only park, motel, corner, and bus stop have trash cans as an implicit element of each of the locations. Therefore, they are not potential locations of the required trash can. To explain further, parks typically do not have trash cans built into them, motels do not offer trash cans to their guests for use, bus stops do not have trash receptacles for trash disposal, and the only store fronts that have trash containers are businesses. Thus, options B, C, D, and E can be eliminated because they contain irrelevant information. \n3) What about the remaining option? The answer is \"C: Street corner.\" This is the easiest to confirm among the other options, because there are trash receptacles right in the corner of streets. If there wasn't a trash can, it would be difficult to pick up trash. In the corner streets in the city, you can clearly see a trash container and thus, if a potential location of a trash can, \"street corner\" (C) is the logical answer.\nSo the finals answer is C: street corner.\n\nInput:How is cheese used?

The time for taking action is \"before\" the passenger used the electronics. But passengers are people who ride on airplanes. So it is impossible to take action before passengers do anything.\n4) \"Land plane\" (D) does not pass logic test because if this is a question regarding electronics use, we are dealing with \"passenger-less\" planes.\n5) The correct answer is \"Fly the plane\" (A). This is because the plane needs to take off before passengers can use electronics.

E: Neptune 6. F: Venus\nOutput: Here the answer to the question is \"Uranus\". It has been confirmed by various studies that Uranus is second to our earth. To calculate the size of the planet, we can do it by using the formula. Uranus Radius = 25433km The radius of the Earth is 6371km.

{"idx": 594, "text": "1) Examine each answer choice individually to gain greater context of what the question asker actually meant.\n2) The answer, to put it simply, is C. Let's consider the following:\n3) A: Under the bed, while convenient to the homeowner, would not be a safe place for a wind instrument as it would likely harm or even break the sensitive equipment.\n4) B: Symphony, while a possible location, doesn't provide enough context. This isn't an individual who is storing a wind instrument with a symphony, but rather a place to store the instrument alone. This is because they're looking for a place to store their wind instrument alone, not with other people's.\n5) C: Music room is the right answer. This answer satisfies two parts of the question. First of all, it's an individual location and not a group. Secondly, it provides a safe environment for the wind instrument and its equipment. Plus, it's a familiar place. \n6) D: Band practice is not the correct answer because while it might be a place with wind instruments (i.e., in a music room), it does not isolate the instrument enough. It would likely be put in storage with other group instruments or with group members, which is not appropriate for the question.\n7) E: Music store is also not the correct answer. The question didn't ask for a place full of wind instruments and a music instrument store just doesn't have a personal area just for a certain individual or family. It wouldn't feel safe for the instrument nor give them the isolation necessary.\nThen, finally, we have C: Music room. This is the correct response because it provides individual isolation where the storage is for an individual or family member, and it also provides a safe place. By providing a music room, we are able to see how the entire question can be interpreted, and the answer can be found by removing certain questions and considering the remaining context. The context, by itself, is incomplete but with consideration to the overall question and the question context (i.e., the questions asked prior), the context can be completed and the answer can be determined.\nThen, finally the actual answer of C Music Room is the most appropriate answer\nSo the final answer of C Music Room", "answer": "C: music room"}

Therefore, none of these choices are the correct answer. \n5. By understanding the way the human body behaves in various situations, we can further narrow down the possibilities. It makes sense that \"She curled up under the...\" would result in her being \"more comfortable,\" since warmth, relaxation, and contentment often accompany curling up.\n6. It would make sense that \"she curled up more...,\" would cause her to be \"sweating\" because of body heat, \"blushing\" because of warmth, or \"cuddled\" because of the warm feelings associated with being curled up. \n7. \"blanket\" is not a logical answer because \"blankets\" rarely give comfort to people. \n\n8. \"Comfort\" and \"comfortable\" are the correct answer.\nSo the final correct answer is D: comfortable\n\nInput:What did the thief steal without seeing his face?

A bookcase (C) can hold homework items like notebooks and papers, but it is not a special place for homework items. At an office supply store (D), you can find a homework bender, like I did, but it isn't the most likely place to go looking for one.

Choices: A: desk B: home office C: library D: office E: study\nOutput: 1) What is the question asking: \"What place is one able to do the most in a single day?\" The key word here is \"single\" and \"day\". This implies that the answer should take into consideration the restrictions of the question when finding an answer. \"What place is one could do the most in a day\" would be more inclusive and would not require the same level of understanding of the restrictions in the question.\n2) Let's examine each of the choices that would not work with the restriction, and see if a more appropriate choice provides a better fit. Some work areas are not able to be done in a single day. So we eliminate options such as desk (A), home office (B), and study (D). A library (C) might have plenty to do in it, but this choice does not follow the single day restriction. We are left with office (E). The office is the most likely place because the restrictions include a single day and \"office\" usually implies a workplace. \n3) Therefore, the answer is E: Office.\nSo, the answer is office\n\nInput: Where can a teacher be", "answer": "E: class room"}

This indicates that Sarah had an idea about the situation, but she was mistaken. \n3. To understand where her mistake was, let's examine each possible answer choice. \n4. Choice A: Sarah thought she had been home all evenings. We know that isn't right, so it can't be the answer.\n5. Choice B: Sarah thought she had left in the day time. If she had thought this, then she would not have thought she was home all evening because the day time could have included a time interval that wasn't home.\n6. Choice C: Sarah thought she had remained home in the evening. Like Choice B, this implies the \"thought she had\" part is incorrect in the conclusion. It can't be the correct answer because it isn't how Sarah interpreted the evening. \n7. Choice D: Sarah thought she had stayed home all night. Sarah thought she was home all night, yet she was really not home at all.\n8. Choice E: Sarah thought she had occupied her time at work. She did think that she had spent her time at work, but that is not in any way relevant to the answer. \n9. Comparing the different choices, we only see one that doesn't indicate she was at home, and that one is Choice D: She thought she had stayed home.\n10.

{"idx": 618, "text": "1) Let's consider each answer choice, starting with choice A: \"ignore.\" This cannot be the answer since teaching grandpa to read is not ignoring him. Ignoring someone includes not speaking to them or not thinking about them at all; teaching grandpa to read requires spending time and energy thinking about and interacting with him.\n2) The word \"wrong\" is used in the sentence. To understand its meaning, let's dissect the word \"wrong\" a little bit. This is because when you do a particular thing wrong, it is not necessarily \"wrong\" in the way it is expected to be done by your culture, society or beliefs or even by your self beliefs. Instead, when you do a thing wrong, it could be \"wrong\" in terms of how it is not done in accordance with a rule or regulations, law. or principle governing someone in a particular profession. For e.g.\n- Failing to use the proper form of English while writing a report while working as a writer could be said to be \"wrong\" because of the rule or regulation or principle governing a writer not to follow the wrong English form while writing a report.\n-  However, the same English form while writing an advert could possibly be allowed to be used instead of the \"right\" English form.\nIn this context, the child really wanted to teach the grandpa to read, it is assumed that it is wrong as per the rules or regulations of the child's culture, society,  belief or self.\n3) Let's now examine choice B: \"write.\" The child cannot be happy about teaching his grandpa to read because being happy is contradictory to the use of the word \"happy.\" It can only be said if the child is not teaching his grandpa to write, that is, he cannot be happy if he was not making his grandpa write even though he was teaching him to read.\n4) Choice C: \"learn new things.\" This also cannot be the real answer because in the context of the given scenario, the child was not happy that his grandpa was not learning new things, but the child was happy that his grandpa could read after he taught him to read.\n5) The final answer is choice D: \"illiterate\".

A coffee shop or book store would not be the correct answer, as they are not buildings with meeting rooms. Likewise, a building would not have a delay to a meeting.\n4. A building could have chairs, but it is unlikely that you would find an office in it. Furthermore, a delay cannot occur at a building, only within it.\n5.

This cannot be the answer either because backyards also don't guarantee the presence of a dog, just pet activity (a cat going outside, etc.).\n\n5. Choice C: \"restaurant\". There are no animals here so this isn't the answer either.\n\n6. Choice D: \"apartment\". This could potentially be the answer, but it hinges on people keeping pets. Apartments could contain pets in them, but it is also possible there isn't one in sight.\n\n7. The answer isn't in the other options; it's in Choice D: \"Apartment.\"\nSo", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

This indicates that icy roads are inherently dangerous and driving too fast will result in danger.\n2. The second option (B) is \"difficult\", emphasizing the potential for danger that comes with speeding on an icy road.\n3. The third option (C) is \"unconcerned\", which implies a lack of caution when driving on an icy road, which is dangerous in itself. \n4. The fourth option (D) is \"stressful\", which could indicate a lack of caution since the presence of stress could make it more difficult to drive carefully.\n5. The final option (E) is \"harder\" when the weather is bad. This emphasizes the difficulty of driving on ice, and driving too fast may exacerbate this difficulty, which presents a danger.\n6. Comparing the options, the one that best matches the description is (B). Driving too fast on an iced road is \"difficult\" due to potential risk.\nSo the final option is B: Difficult\n\nInput: I'm not going to take my car out if I see it covered in ice as I'd be what? Choices:   A: deadly B C D E: driving through\nOutput: To answer, we must first determine the meaning of the answers individually.\n\n1. \"Deadly\" (A) indicates that driving on an iced road could be fatal.\n2. \"Stressful\" (B) refers to a lack of caution, which could potentially result in negative consequences on the road.\n3. \"Unconcerned\" (C) indicates that the driver is indifferent to the risk of driving, implying a lack of caution due to either unawareness or disregard.\n4. \"Difficult\" (D) indicates that the risk of driving might be challenging due to ice accumulating on the car.\n5. Lastly, option (E) \"driving through\" indicates that the driver may be rash and careless, potentially leading to danger.\n6. The best choice that meets the description is option B: stressful, so the final answer is B: Stressful\nso the final answer is B. stressful", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

Also, \"dissipate\" is not likely to be used in this circumstance.\n3. \"Flown\" (B) describes movement. \"Flown\" is also an unlikely choice to be used to describe the state of money after it has run out.\n4. \"Disintegrate\" (C) describes an item breaking apart at the molecular or atomic level. \"Disintegrate,\" therefore, is not the correct answer because it is not the right sort of breakdown of money. \n5. \"Fall apart\" (D) cannot be the answer because money cannot fall apart.\n6. \"Penulimate\" (E), though, might fit the bill, as it means the worst state that something can be in. Therefore, \"Penulimate,\" though uncommon, is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer (Penultimate) is E: penultimate (Penilmate)\n\nInput: What can't a plumber who has stopped smoking do to quit smoking again? Choices: 1. He can have a cigarette. 2. He can have a beer. 3. He can have a coke. 4. He can watch a cereal commercial. 5. He can work on the bathroom.\nOutput: 1). He can't have a cigarette because now he is a quitter. 2). He can't drink coke or beer because he is a non-drinker due to his new sobriety. 3). He can't watch cereal commercials because he doesn't eat cereal. 4). He can't go to work because the bathroom is the only place for a plumber where he can work.

If the homeowner doesn't allow guests, it would also serve as a restaurant; if the homeowner sells things, it would also serve sales purposes. \n3) If a family owns a bar, it would be a restaurant for the family and a place to buy items for guests and customers. Thus, the correct answer is C: Own house. \n4) A \"Shopping center\" (E) is a place to buy things and a place to get food; it does not represent both possibilities at the same time.

{"idx": 662, "text": "1) The first important thing to note is what the question refers to as a \"gathering.\" The question doesn't say if this gathering is large or small. We can assume it is not large, since the word \"gathering\" implies a smaller-than-normal venue. \n2) Looking in a concert hall (A), we can eliminate the answer due to the fact that the performer is not attending a gathering at their friends' locale. \n3) The same can be said for a theater-operatic (B), because the performer isn't attending a gathering of friends. \n4) A party or gathering (C) can also be eliminated, because the performer isn\u2019t attending a regular party or a gathering. He\u2019s there specifically to perform for his friends and their guests. \n5) The stage or dance floor (E) doesn't work, so we'll eliminate it.\n\n6) The stage at a concert or show (E) is also out of the question since the performer isn'tdoing any performance here. \n\n7) With this information, we can conclude that the performer is attending a gathering with his or her friends. But which specific type of gathering are we talking about? The only type of gathering left is a gathering at a house. \n8) Eliminate the choices D, E, A, and B since these choices weren't mentioned in the question.

{"idx": 666, "text": "1) Begin by looking carefully at the options. 2) An important clue to work from is the phrase, \"when his friend said a bovine animal could be what\". Not the animal is a bovine, but someone said a bovine is what. This is the key word to understand what the question is asking about. 3) The most direct definition of \"bovine\" (an adjective) is \"pertaining to cows\". From this it is clear that Option A: \"feeble\" doesn't make sense as a verb in this context. 4) Also look at word definitions to gain further information. The definition of \"feeble\" (adj) according to https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feeble is \"characterized by a lack of sufficient strength or energy: weak\". The synonyms of feeble include: pallid, weak, wan and wimpy. 5) Since \"feeble\" refers to a lack of strength or energy, it is very unlikely that a cow could be anything that is feeble. 6) Therefore, Option B: \"bullbleep\" is the best answer among the options, since the word \"bull\" is a synonym of \"feeble\". 7) The definition of bullbleep from https://www.meriam-webster.com \"bullbleep 1: bull 2: blather b(1) 2 a : rubbish, hokum b : stuff, bull \u2014often used ironically bull b : untrue nonsense I'd be happy to come but for the bull that the trip requires\" is quite appropriate. 8) Option C: female, as a synonym of cow, doesn't make any sense. A \"female bovine\" is a cow. 9) Option D: charging prey makes no sense either. Although it is an appropriate synonym of cow, it does not represent any form of \"what\" to which a bull could be. 10) Only option E remains, although it's not entirely clear whether it actually makes sense or not. In a sense, the question has been answered as it requires a simple definition as an answer.\nSo the final  answer is E: charging pre", "answer": "D: female"}
{"idx": 670, "text": "1) The first question to ask is what are all of the possible driving locations mentioned in the sentence. James drove his niece to the family reunion, therefore, the location is a family reunion. Also, the uncle's house was mentioned when his niece's house was mentioned, indicating family relation. \n2) There are five options to choose from. Option B mentions family, however, family isn't always in the same place. What would he need to travel to see all of his family? The family reunion. \n3) Option A mentions great granddad. Did James need to see his great granddad? No, because he was already seen and mentioned in the sentence. Since his great granddad was mentioned in another location as well, he wouldn't need travel or drive there. \n4) Option B mentions family picture book. Is his sister the only family member with a family picture book? No, all of his family has a family picture book. There are pictures of all of his family in his family picture book. All of his family members weren't there when he was traveling to his niece's. Therefore, he doesn't need to drive to his brother's house to see family. \n5) Option C mentions brother, but his brother didn't take his niece. It is unlikely that James travels or drives to his brother's to see family because he was already traveling to his nieces and brother.\n6) Option D mentions family tree. A family tree is in a family reunion. 7) Option E mentions family reunion. He was already traveling and driving to a family reunion.

A: during the exam season 4: none of the above 5: during the exam season\nOutput: 1: Student can never have to wait until next exam in case they do not enroll in the exam. 2. During school holiday is not an appropriate choice because student can get rest at home. 3: student can wait until next exam season. 4: The student will never have to wait to take their exam.\n5.

{"idx": 678, "text": "1.\"Paying money\" would imply that the person is required to pay in order to receive any goods, however the opposite is true. 2. \"Losing money\" is not the answer because this is not what \"trick women\" means. 3. \"Getting money\" would have the opposite effect of the question and is not the answer. 4. \"Going shopping\" is not the answer since shopping is not a part of the question's statement. 5. \"Saving money\" is not the correct answer. 6. \"Some stores trick women to by products, the sales make them seem like they will save money while buying more?\" could be answered with \"C\" \"Some stores trick women into buying products, the sales make the items seem like they will save you money while buying more?\". \n7.  If we continue to examine \"Some stores trick women...\", we see that they are getting women to buy more items by convincing them that they will save money buying more. \n8. One way that the retailer can show a savings is if they sell two items for the price of one. To further demonstrate this we can take the phrase \"Some stores trick...\", then rearrange to give the answer choice \"By selling things in two different bundles (A, B)\", as B can only refer to products. This leads directly to the correct answer of the question\nSo the final answer  is B: selling products in two different bundles\nOutput: 1- What is the definition of \"being successful\"?\n2- What is the main goal of learning? \n\n1. \"The definition of being successful\" means the same thing as being successful itself.\n2.

Next, examine each option to determine which option is related to money. \"Work in life\" (B) is not the answer because while it involves working, it focuses on the general concept of work, not an occupation specifically associated as a way to make money. \n3.) Similarly, \"Speak to people\" (C) is likely to be a communication skill but not one that would inherently lead to money. \n4.) Option \"Everywhere\" (D) also doesn't seem to answer the question directly as this is a broad term that could be used to describe any location. \n5.) Finally, option \"Care for people\" (E) focuses more on the concept of people than one's own monetary state. This is also not directly related to earning money.\n6.) Comparing all the answer options, the answer is \"sitting ideal\" (A) because this option not only provides specific instructions for earning money but is closely related to the question itself. In addition, \"sitting ideal\" emphasizes that a specific posture is important for earning money.\n7.)

Civil action can cause confusion, but it must be clarified that this confusion is not an inherent result of civil action itself, but rather something that may be caused by it. \n4: Choice D: hurt feelings. This cannot be an inevitable result of civil action because sometimes it results in positive resolutions and the healing of relationships. \n5: Choice E: sandwiches. This is not a result of civil action because this can occur in any setting, not just civilized ones. \n6: Lastly, the choice that we conclude is the correct one is Choice C, which is going to court. This is the intended effect or purpose of civil action, to go to court and argue for a resolution.\nSo the final answers is C: going to court\n\nInput:When would I need a water filter for my drinking water?

Choices:  a) happiness b) upset c) sadness d) feeling good about someone e) being excited over nothing\nOutput: 1: This is a question about whether you can be upset and happy at the same time. 2: \"Feeling good about somebody\" has no relation of being happy/upset. \"Excited over nothing\" sounds somewhat positive if you've been excited for no reason, but it can also reflect a negative or neutral state.\n3: \"Sadness\" is a similar level of negativity to \"upset\", so this one is ruled out. 4: \"Happiness\" is directly opposed to \"upset\", because with \"happiness\" your mindset is positive, which is the opposite of being upset, or feeling negative. \n5: We are left with \"Upset\" and \"upset\" as the only two viable options. \n6: Therefore, \"Upset\" is the answer.\nSo the final answers is Upset\n\nInput:A group of people are watching a movie on a ship.

It could also be indicative of lying, but blushing may not necessarily be an indicator of lying and someone may blush from a completely innocent cause such as embarrassment. 7) Based on these considerations, it's likely that all of the answer choices could be indicators of lying. Thus, the answer cannot be limited to any particular option. \n8) In short, all of the answer choices are indicators of lying, and it would be inappropriate to say that one answer is better than the others, since they are equivalently good or bad. \nSo the final answer has to be N/A (None of the above)\n\nInput: Which job does the word \"office\" typically describe?

This way we look at the options from the same perspective as the question is asking about it.\n2) It seems that this question is comparing the different abilities of humans and the amount of creativity each individual has.\n3) Since there are many varieties of ways to do this, let us eliminate the options that would fall outside this scope. For example, singers, dancers and artists are a form of expressing oneself, therefore sing and dance cannot be chosen.\n4) Now consider the ability to create art. This involves many skills like drawing, sculpting, painting, writing, and photography. These skills can be used differently depending on the person and what they wish to accomplish.\n5) The question is asking, \"everybody has a little bit\" or \"a small amount\" of creativity.

While the countryside could include many different landscapes which could be shaped like a globe, this is not necessarily the case.\n3) Choice B: farming areas. One of the clues that this can't be the answer is that farming areas contain crops. Farms, not states. While some farms are owned by individual states such as North Dakota, that is not the focus here.\n4) Choice C: Michigan. We know this for sure because it is a state, and states are not necessarily shaped like gloves.\n5) Choice D: Texas. This cannot be the solution because Texas is not the correct shape. It is also not much of a farming state, as one of the largest cities has over 4 million residents.\n 6) Choice E: North Dakota.

Because we think \"The home garden decline\" means that people don't usually tend their own gardens because of the decline, it looks like the economy may be the reason for the decline.

Choices:  C: fur  A: hat B: scarf D: gloves E: blanket F: fur\nOutput:Another common idiomatic phrase is \"wearing **something** in **something**\". Here \"in\" is referring to the season, which is winter, and so we are looking for an item that you would **wear** in winter. The options you might see on someone wearing a red blanket in winter include: fur, hat, scarf, gloves. Since fur is mentioned as an item you might be likely to see on someone wearing **a** red blanket in winter, it can be excluded as being incorrect in the answer choices. The options include: **hat**, **scarf**, **gloves**, and **fur**. Scarf and gloves are both common clothing items worn in winter. Hats are often worn in winter as well, but not as common as gloves or hats, and are also often worn in winter. Fur is **not** something worn in winter as it is usually worn in other seasons.\nTherefore, the answer is C: **scarf**.\nSo the final text is C: scarf\n\nInput: To which place does the road lead when it's lined by trees?

This isn't applicable in the context of the question because people who really live life fully aren't so idealistic.\n6. \"Feel young again\" (D) is an option that indicates a certain type of enthusiasm that could be a product of living life fully, but that's not the most important part of the entire concept.\n7. \"Happy\" (B) could be a byproduct of living life fully in some cases but as suggested, it's just one component of a bigger picture of living life fully. 8.

{"idx": 822, "text": "1 Let's begin by looking at the choices individually. \n2. Option A: happiness. This is impossible because if you are not good, you cannot derive happiness from playing violin\n3. Option B: relaxation. While you can relax by playing violin, this isn't the primary driver, which is why this choice is not the correct answer.\n4. Option C: create music. This is not an inherent outcome of playing violin because you can create music by playing it, but you are not necessarily guaranteed to create music if you are not good\n5. Option D: sadness. While you can be sad if you aren't good at playing violin, this is not an inevitable result of playing and, therefore, not an inherent outcome.\n6. Last, we turn to Option E: loud noises. This is also incorrect because there are other ways to create loud noises without playing violin, such as shouting or blowing a whistle. Additionally, if you're not good at playing violins, you might not want to create loud noises in the first place.\n7. Ultimately, this leaves us with Option A: happiness as the only remaining choice. While you can derive happiness by playing violin, regardless of your skill level, it is a much more common result if you are good at playing. \n8.

Furthermore, airports have other things to do while you sit there: read books and magazines, people watch, window shop, and even talk to other travelers. Some coffee shops offer water bowls for pets. \n3 If an office building were to provide water bowls for their animals, it would likely be in the lobby or a common area to sit. Furthermore, such a human could sit on the coffee shop floor if they were at a cappuccino shop, but a cappuccine shop is a different thing than the airport as it is a destination to eat coffee beverage for entertainment rather than to travel. \n4 The solar system is interesting, as animals exist in outer space but on terra firma it is not feasible. \n5 The bathroom at home is a very good place to sit over a water bowl.\n6 At a family member's funeral, another good place for a human to sit is over a water bowl because it is a ritual for the departed human. On the other hand, there are a lot of people waiting their turn to sit at public water bowls or over a body of water.\n7 The coffee shop, bathroom, bathroom at home, the solar system, the airport, and the family member's funeracial area all have the ability for the human to sit while keeping their pet's water bowl clean.

This is an interesting choice, because it seems directly parallel to the scenario described in the question. Stopping arguing could potentially be a feat, however, it wouldn't be the only feat involved, as there is other work to do after arguing stops. This is more of an intermediate step.\n\n4. Choice D: do business. Business is not the answer either because doing business is quite easy, considering business occurs all over the planet.\n\n5. Choice A: accomplish. This is the closest answer, but it's not the correct answer. Accomplishing something could certainly be a feat, but the scenario described in the original question is asking what accomplishing the deal entailed, not another accomplishment in general.\n\n6. Choice E: concert. Finally, the correct answer is here.

{"idx": 862, "text": "1) Let's consider the options and try to eliminate any that don't meet our goal. \n\n2) Option A: sign language. Sign language can help someone who can't speak coherently convey what they want to say. However, the question states that we will be helping someone who ISN'T able to speak coherent speech, which means this option doesn't make enough sense.\n\n3) Option B: complete sentence. This option is also out because the question doesn't ask us to complete a sentence or have someone speak coherently. We are instead told to help someone who cannot say or communicate coherently. \n\n4) Option D: feel angry. This option is also incorrect because it doesn't match the action required to help someone who is not able to speak intelligibly. \n\n5) Option E: cross street. Now, let's determine if cross street answers the question. The question asks us to help a person who cannot speak coherently. To do this,  we would have to be able to understand them, which means we would have to be near the person. Cross streets, on the other hand,  are far away. \n\n6) This leaves only our last choice, option C: drink tea.  Drinking tea can help us understand people better because it allows us to share conversations with them and get to know them more. This also shows a possible course of action that we could do for that person.\n\n7) Thus, the final answer is C: drink tea.\n\nSo the final answer if drink tea\n\nInput: What are several benefits of using a ladder?

{"idx": 866, "text": "1) The question here is about where did the investigator send the gun evidence, based on whether the gun was a holster, a back, to crime scene, police station, drawer or to the owner.\n2) The key here is the clue of whether the gun was a back, a holster, a crime scene or the crime scene.  \n3) If the gun was back, its evidence would go back to its owner, if the gun was drawer its evidence would go to the drawer, if the gun was crime scene it\u2019s evidence would go to crime scene and if the gun was police station its evidence would go to police station.\n4) When we have a doubt in our mind about which place does it go to, the answer could be drawer because as we know in crimes scene drawer has important role, when crime scene is closed the evidence is to sent to drawer and is examined by police.\n\n5) Now lets find out which is not a place for evidence to go for the holster gun:\n  Holster \u2013 this is a gun place that is attached to a person, which is very hard to be separated from a person without crime scene, to the scene there is no necessity for holster gun, the only place that this kind of gun will be found is in the holster of a criminal.\nNow lets see why gun not a back to its owner:\n  If the gun was back to its owner, as we know this kind of gun is a very hard thing to be back to its owner, because this gun is not just a simple gun that goes to holster, you can not get this gun at home if its not your holster gun.\n  That means that if the gun was back to the owner, this is a special case. So the possible answer if the gun was back is police station.\nWe did this to find two possible answers that the question can refer to.\n6) So two possible cases are: \n  Drawer gun evidence \u2192 going to drawer\n  Police station gun evidence \u2192 Gun going to police station and evidence going to crime scene.", "answer": "C: police station"}

Flowers (C) would not be present in indoors facing rooms. Rooms facing outside do not have doors, they're outside.\n2.\"High Walls\" (E) is a choice that is only included to cover every possible option, as \"high walls\" wouldn't necessarily be related to looking at something outside.\n3.\"Doors and Windows\" (D) is a logical answer because they're things that are necessary for seeing the outside.\n4.\"Square Shape\" (A) is not useful in answering the question. All rooms are shaped like rectangles, with doors and windows being two rectangular holes to let light in.\n5.\"Different Sizes\" (B) isn't useful either because all rooms have the same size and can only fit one door and window.\n6.

Let's first eliminate choices that make no sense. \"Neither\" (C) is an invalid choice because an apple cannot eat an apple. \n2. \"None of the other choices\" (B) is also an invalid choice because each choice (only apple and pear) cannot be eaten separately.\n3. \"A mixture of apples and pears\" (E) is not an answer because we can just eat an entire apple or pear.\n4. This leaves only: \n5. \"Apples\" (A) and \"Trees\" (D), which are the only choices that can be eaten. This leaves \"Apples\" being the correct answer as it can be eaten without having to first eat a tree.\nSo the final choice is A: apples (apple fruits).", "answer": "D: doors and windows"}

{"idx": 878, "text": "1: Let's identify the options that could not cause this and eliminate them from the answer possibilities. \"Full of fear\" does not say anything about being wet, so Choice A is \"run\" can be dismissed. \n2. Since urinating can be scary when it's uncontrollable, Choice E could potentially be the cause. However, this happens when one is wet due to an uncontrollable urge to urinate, so let's dismiss this choice as well.\n3. There's also Choice D: fight an enemy. While fighting an enemy can be dangerous and lead to being wet (from sweating), there are other potential reasons to fight in situations such as water fights. Therefore, this can also be dismissed.\n4. After doing this, we have narrowed the possible answers to Choices B and C: swimming and calculating respectively. \n5. However, since swimming involves going into water, Choice C (calculate things quickly) is more likely to result in wetness as one might accidentally get wet while calculating in a dangerous position.\n6. The correct answer is thus C: calculate.\nSo the final choice is C: calculate\n\nInput: If you find a long line of cars, which of the following are you more likely to see?

Let's look at each individual choice to find the answer. \n2. A long line of people could be a possible answer but it can have less cars and more people. This has also been narrowed down to Choice C: bikes. This is when people who cycle in a long line of cyclists. \n3. A long line of bikes, however, doesn't have any cars and has only bikes, and is hence dismissed as well. Therefore, the correct answer is: D: animals.\nSo the final answer Is D: animals\n\nInput: When using the elevator, which of these could happen?

Finally, \"He slept bed\" is another incorrect answer because it doesn't mention the word \"living\" and the sentence does not indicate that there is a bed in the living room in question. \n6) It's clear that only \"He slept on the living room\" matches the text provided and is thus the correct answer.

For example, a wishing well or hardware store would not require a common pail to get something out of them, so we can exclude them from our search. \n2) The garage is a possible location, but let's be more selective. If we're looking for what he put in a pail, then a pail from the garage or another area of the house would be likely. Additionally, the janitor in this situation is unlikely to get his pail out of the garage at the same time that he's getting his mop, so we don't need to worry about the janitor getting both items out of the garage.\n\n3) Considering we can exclude a garage and other locations, we're left with two options: the utility room and the kitchen. We can check to see if these rooms are likely places to keep extra household items, and if so, we've found our answer. \n\n4) A utility room contains household items like brooms and a vacuum to clean or mop the house. A janitor using the utility room would likely have a pail in case he needs to mop the floor or for other household purposes. Thus, the utility room serves as an area for the janitor to get his pail from.\n\n5) Similarly, a kitchen often contains household items for cooking or food cleanup like pots, pans, mixing bowls, and spoons. A janitor using a kitchen would have pots, pans with lids, and other household items, so it would make sense to keep a pail in the kitchen in case of a spill or another mop cleanup. Thus, we eliminate the last option, the kitchen, because it is not the answer to our riddle. \n\n6) We are now left with only the utility room as the best possible location. Thus, the answer to the riddle is that the janitor got a pail from the utility room.\nSo the final answered is D: utility room", "answer": "E: utility room"}

We can also find bears in both the wild and at a zoo, depending on different circumstances.\n4. It's clear in the question that the setting is in woods, so no, not at the zoo or aquarium. 5.

Therefore, this option is incorrect as it's a misinterpretation of what the question is asking and what it says.\n5) Choice B (\"alone\") implies that the crowd is alone. This is also incorrect as it contradicts what the question is saying (i.e. it wasn't big).\n6) Choice C (\"small group\") is the correct answer. It's not that the crowd wasn't \"big,\" it's that it was \"too small.\" The crowd might be relatively small, but it can still technically be considered a crowd. \n7) Choice D (\"solitude\") implies that the crowd was alone and isolated, and this is also incorrect as it goes against what the question is asking about it being \"too small\" rather than \"too big.\"\n8) Choice E (\"solitary\") is confusing in terms of what it means. It implies that the crowd is \"solitary,\" but it could also mean that it's a solitary crowd (with a solitary meaning \"alone\" like a single person or animal) or it could mean that the crowd itself is solitary, which is also incorrect as it wouldn't make sense in this context because the entire point of the question is that the crowd wasn' t big enough to begin with.", "answer": "C: small group"}

So to understand this, it helps to look at each answer choice in detail.\n2. \"To be hung in the closet\" (B) isn't an option because you have to wash clothes before you hang them in the closet. \n3. \"To sniff\" (C) is another bad choice because you want something you can't wash to not smell. \n4. \"To get dirty\" (D) is not a reasonable option because it makes little sense how an object that has lost its ability to be washed can have dirt. \n5. \"To become soiled (E)\" wouldn't be ideal because soiling refers to getting food or other substances on an item, whereas a smell wouldn't mean you have to wash something to remove the substance. \n6. So this leaves us with \"Air out.\" This is the most logical answer because airing something out is the way to get rid of any unpleasant odors or substances on an item.\n\nSo the final answer, is air out", "answer": "E: air out"}
{"idx": 946, "text": "1.\"What might the inability _to learn_ cause?\" - This question requires some attention: The keyword is \"to learn.\" We want to infer something about inability to learn, in other words, about a failure to learn rather than learning itself.\n2. Eliminating options that are not an action (\"A stupid\", option E) or effect (options C and D), the question still requires an action for the inability to learn. We can see that \"Ability to learn\" is one action (\"ability\") and \"Adequate amount of money\" is another (\"a\" and \"amount\").\n3. In other words, we should select two different actions to \"Adequate...\".\n4. The remaining three actions are \"distress\" (action #1), \"effectiveness\" (action #2) and \"Inability to learn\" (action #3).\n5. Thus, our answer set becomes: \n[A], [B], [C], [D] and [E]. \n6. In order to identify the correct answer, we want to remove the following from the list:\n\na) We don't use the two terms interchangeably so [A], [B], and [C] are not correct.  \n\t(Explanation: If we remove [C] and [D], \"distress\" and \"effectiveness\" will be the two most common remaining terms, so let's think about which of the two is more appropriate. The answer seems obvious when we look closer, because the question suggests that either inability to learn or lack of ability to learn is a serious cause, i.e. a distressing cause. Therefore, the answer seems more likely to be \"[A]\" than \"[C]\" \"ability to learn\" and \"inability to learn\" are different things, i.e. action#2 and action#3 are disjoint actions, so \"inability to learn cause distress\" is a correct statement.)\n\nb) After removing [A], inevitably, we're left with an empty subset and [B], [D] and [\"Inability to\" + an effect] are the remaining terms. So finally, the answer is [B] \"intelligence\".\n\nSo the final answer choice is B: Intelligence\n\nInput: Where is the closest station to a building where I have never been?

If each compartment has its own ruler, then a drawer could have multiple rulers.\n6) A desk could be thought of as a piece of furniture that has several drawers to store objects.

{"idx": 974, "text": "1) First, let's identify the key phrases: \"When pens\" and \"aren't work.\" We can deduce from this that pens are the correct word to guess because the sentence indicates a problem with pens.\n2) Then, let's determine the main meaning of the question by analyzing the individual words. \"Pens isn't work\" could be interpreted as \"Pens aren't doing their job.\" This further narrows our search.\n3) Next, let's examine the answer choices. Pens might be inked or use caps, but this isn't a sufficient answer because the core issue is still there. We can also rule out ink cartridges and taking notes, as these aren't the primary focus of the sentence.\n4) Ultimately, we are left with either scribbling or putting ink in the pens. In either case, \"your pens\" indicates that the speaker is referring to ones owned by the person the sentence is addressed to. It cannot be the pens of someone else because \"your\" pens don't have to be owned by the same person as the speaker.\n5) Consequently, the answer must be putting ink in the user's own pens. Although ink cartridges don't work, you can still use your pens to scribble or write.\nSo the final answers are C: ink cartridge", "answer": "A: ink in"}
{"idx": 978, "text": "1: The question is asking where one can find a movie theater alongside other stores in one place. The key is emphasizing the word \"one place.\"\n2. Looking at the options, only \"downtown area\" (A) and \"shopping mall\" (D) come close to meeting this requirement.\n3. \"Downtown area\" would contain a movie theater as a standalone business, but it wouldn'thave any connection to stores except for the movie theater being a place where you can see movies. This answer is therefore inaccurate.\n4. \"Shopping mall\" could potentially feature a movie theater alongwith other stores, especially on the main level, since that's where other stores are. There is potential for other stores to be connected to the movie theater. However, it is not a sure thing as some shopping malls have theaters on the main level while others on their second floors, connected via elevators. \n5. Let's now examine some other places that do feature a movie theater alongside stores (and are also acceptable answers to this question).\n6. One place is an \"urban area\" (B), since urbanareas often include movie theaters as part of their downtown business areas.\n7.

{"idx": 982, "text": "1.\"Get arrested\". This does not have any relevance to buying beer, so it is not relevant in this context.\n2. \"Problems\". A possible explanation for someone buying beer is drinking it. When people drink beer, they may experience some problems, such as becoming intoxicated. However, buying beer is not directly doing this, and so it cannot be the reason for buying beer.\n3. \"To be sober\". The purpose of buying beer could be to become sober. In this case, drinking the beer would directly result in not being intoxicated anymore, which solves the issue of drunkenness. However, this is not the reason that one would buy beer. Buying beer is simply an action preceding intoxication and does not solve the issue; instead it allows it. Therefore, \"to be sober\" is an incorrect answer.  \n4. \"Intoproximation\". Buying beer is a possible action that can lead to a person getting very intoxicated. However. \"intoxication\" is the reason for getting very intoxicated and no longer intoxicated. Buying beer to become intoxicated is not the reason for buying the beer, but a possible action that may happen during the buying. Therefore, \"intoxication\" cannot be the answer either.\n5. \"To take risks\". One possible reason for buying beers is taking risks. However, being arrested and sober and intoxicated would not be risks but actual results of drinking the beer. Rather, being intoxicated may be viewed as a risk, because while the person is intoxicated they may be incapable of making reasonable decisions. However, the person taking the risk of getting intoxicated is not buying beer for that reason, but is buying the beer for the possibility of taking the risk of getting \"very intoxicated\". Therefore, \"took risks\" is an incorrect answer as well.\n6. \"In pleasure\". One possible reason for drinking beer is to experience pleasure. However, in this case the pleasure comes after drinking the beer; buying the beer is not the action that results in the pleasure. Therefore. \"to pleasure\" is inaccurate.\n7. \"For intoxication\".

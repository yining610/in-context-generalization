Capital cities and Little Italy being two unrelated words, I can immediately eliminate the possibility for those being the answer. \n\nWe now then go on to eliminate B: Street; as that is a place where a restaurant may be, there is not any place that I could specifically expect to find pizza, and furthermore, as the original question asks me to expect, \"Where\" is definitely not something to expect in a pizza parlor. \n\nNow that we have eliminated these, we can focus on the more important details of choices, little Italy and Food Court.  \n\n2. Food Court I assume will generally be a place where food stalls are, and as a result, while there aren't necessarily pizza stalls in restaurants, the whole purpose of the food court is to supply food, and we can also assume that there will be some pizza shop there.\n\n4. Similarly, the whole purpose of Little Italy is to supply all the things that Italians need and want; as a result, with the original question, it becomes very clear why it is a location where a pizza parlor could be. \n\n5. As pizzerias are often found in very well known, commonly know places, you would expect to find a pizzaria in these places, which means that it would be very unusual to expect an Italian restaurant in a capital city, therefore, that is the answer.", "answer": "D: food court"}

Option A: 'broadcast' is the only one missing, as the other 4 options only concern with radio, and not what we can do with it.\n2. A broadcast could potentially be recorded or transmitted (the 'what' of the sentence).\n3. The word'recording' in A and 'transmitting' in D do not fit the structure of the question, as they are verbs (not what's done to a radio).\n4. So \"The radio is X for B (broadcast)\" doesn't fit, leaving us with A: broadcast.\n5. Option B: 'transmission' is incorrect because it doesn't relate to a radio at all.\n6.

The sentence initially asks for a suitable nounthe grammatical rules which have the noun or the pronoun as the subject of the verb, then the noun is placed after the conjugated verb.\n2. Option C cannot be the answer because a business is an entity, whereas we are looking for nouns with the meaning of a team.\n3. The fourth option. \"A committee\", is a collective that comprises members called members of a committee, as well as the president and vice-president or chairman of the committee etc.\n4. Hence, the answer must be: A: a group\n5. The answer option, \"A group\", is an entity like a committee that is formed to perform particular functions and activities.\n6.

'Roast' means to cook food at a high temperature, usually in the oven.\n2. 'You can use an air' means that it can do it in the air.\n3. 'Use to' doesn't make any sense at all, as it's not something that is used.\n\n4. The last three options, vegetable, steak, and chicken don't make sense, as they're obviously foods.\n5. So we can rule out these three.\n6. 'Potato' would make sense, but it doesn't make the sentence correct. \n7. The sentence is trying to say that you can roast anything using an air fryer, not just specific types of food like vegetable, steak or chicken.\n8. 'Potato','stake', steak', and'vegetable' are not nouns, so the only option that fits the format and answer of the question is 'potato'.\n9. Therefore, the answer should be E: Potato.\n10.

'it' is a pronoun and the sentence doesn't require it.\nThe third option, 'c': door, refers to the frame of a door or a panel in the door, which is usually wooden. 'd': table is incorrect because a table doesn't usually have a wooden frame.

'He said' is the first verb in the sentence indicating that the sentence is narrative in nature. \n2. \"You may be a doctor\" - 'You' may have an action here so use pronouns to fit in and \"His wife\" is being used here as the pronoun. \n3. \"But I'm your husband\" -'my' is being used to fit in here as pronoun because \"I'm\" is an action and 'husband' is the subject of the sentence. \n4. \"Your doctor\" would not be grammatically correct. \n5. 'Your spouse' - 'Spouse' describes a couple married to each other, which does not fulfil the requirements of the sentence. 6. 'Your husband'- He can call his wife as \"You're my beautiful wife\".\n7. 'Your mate' -'Your mate' can not be used because'you are my wife' doesn't fit here. \n8. \"Your family\" cannot be used because \"You're my ( beautiful/ darling) wife\". \n9. The only option that provides you with complete understanding of the sentence is A: your husband. \n10. Rationalise and conclude that option A: your husband is the correct answer choice.\nAnswer: A: your husband\n\n### Input:\"A woman came to our office", "answer": "A: depressed"}

Burn hot \nBurning hot suggests that it is an extremely high temperature. When you say hot in a place what we mean is there is a high temperature. \nSo the second option is D: court, the question was not where you would find a high temperature but where you will find a bee collect the pollen from a flower, so the second option is not accurate.\n### B. Sky \nBees don\u2019t collect pollen from the sky but from the plants so the option \"sky\" doesn\u2019t fit the answer.\n### C.Field of flowers \nA field consists of many different flowers and the other type would be the orchard.The flower field doesn\u2019t imply that it could be a place where bees would gather pollen. \n### D. Gas station \nA gas station does have fuel tanks but no flowers or anything for bees.\n### E. Unite state or fruit orchard \nWe can not find unite state or fruit orchards in a classroom.

{"text": "Choices:  A: hosts B: hate C: nose D: hand E: fists\n\n### Rationales:  \n1. The sentence tells us that John is trying to do something with his fists, but he does not succeed.\n2. He will have injured his hands, rather than his 'fists', which he used for punching.\n2. The last option, \"He will be unable to hold his fists\", does not suit what the sentence is asking about.\n2. The term 'hands' means the whole pair: left and right. So the sentence is asking us about what he will injure if he continues punching.\n3. He will hurt both his left hand and right hand.\n1. He will be unable to hold either his fist or hand, since he has injured them both.\n1. Hence, the answer must be 'his hands'.\n1. Therefore, the answer choice that most fit the sentence is E: hand\n\nThe second option that fit the sentence is C: nose.\nThe sentence uses the expression \u2018hostile and ineffectual behavior\u2019. However, it does not refer to the whole hostile and ineffectual behaviour itself. Instead, it refers to the fact that the whole behavior resulted in only blotches, and that John would not be able to continue the behavior.\nTherefore, the sentence is asking about the \u2018behavior\u2019 that John would like to carry on.\nThe first choice, A: hostility fits the structure of the sentence and also answers the question asked\nThe first option, A: hostility. refers to the hostile behavior in which John is involved. It is therefore correct choice that describes hostile and ineffective behaviour.\n\nThe third choice, B: hate. although it refers to \u2018John\u2019s emotional reaction to the whole behavior of him injuring his knuckles\u2019 (as it is defined in the book), but it does not answer the question. The question asks us to find the part of his behavior that he will not be able to continue. However, \u2018hate is defined [by the book] as an emotion, not a behavior and therefore, it is inappropriate choice to answer the question.\nThe fourth choice, C: nose. however, does not answer the question either. This is because the nose is an organ, not a behavior, and therefore not the part", "answer": "E: hands"}

Choices: \nA: A handful is more than enough B: When you have a lot of something then the amount is large C: There is something small D: You can take more stuff E: You can get some more\nRationales:\n1. \"To give\" means to share something.\n2. \"To give a lot\" means to share a lot.\n3. \"To have a lot\" means to own a lot.\n4. \"To have much\" means to own something.\n5.

{"text": "D: \"way too much\" because the word \"was\" refers to the past.\n\n### Rationale:1. We use \"was\" to refer to the past. If you use \"were\" or \"is\", then the meaning of the sentence will change. This shows that the sentence asked for something in the past.\n2. We can rule out choices A: \"buying\" and choice B: \"purchase\" because \"was\" refers to in the past and \"buying\" and \"purchase\" are actions that can be done now.\n3. Options C: \"overpriced\" and D: \"way to much\" does not answer the question because \"overpriced\" means the price is too high, but \"way to much\" means the quantity of the item is too much.\n4. Hence, the only choice that answers the question is B: \"purchase\".\n5.

Choices: 1. A: just for fun 2. A: win prizes 3. C: compete 4. D: don\u2019t know why 5. E: compete for fun\n\nRationales:  1. The response \"just for fun\" could be given in the sentence if the first option was \"running\".\n\n2. \"Just for fun\" is not a real answer to the question, but rather a suggestion for what to choose as an answer.\n\n3. The first option is \"running\" which refers to a physical activity that has no goal but to burn extra calories and get fit.\n\n4. Though the option \"win prizes\" is appropriate, it\u2019s not the answer; it is a part of the answer, but the sentence asks us to choose all of the answer.\n\n5. The term \"compete for fun\" should be used, because \"playing sports without competition\" doesn\u2019t have a goal, meaning that \"competing for fun\" is a part of the sentence.\n\n### Input (continued):If there is no competition to win prizes, which of the following is not an appropriate activity? Choices:  a. playing sports  b. win medals  c. have fun  d. get fat  e. play chess\n\n### Response (Continued):\nAll of the activities that are given in the sentence are appropriate only if there is a competition. \"Winning medals\" or \"winning prizes\" is a goal of playing sports. Hence, they can be done, but they are only applicable when there is a competition. Therefore, a is valid, b is not valid, c is valid. \nD is not valid and e is valid.

Choices:  A \"The chef\" B \"a chef doesn't do\" C \"The chef doesn't like to do\" D \"Does a chef cook dinner\" E \"a chef is cooking\"\n\n### Rationale:\n#### 1. The verb \"do\" is the auxiliary verb in the question. \"do\" when used wiith the subject, the subject is not included. \n2. \"What\" is used to ask for information.\n3. Therefore \"What does the chef do when working in evening\" is an interrogative sentence, and has the same word order.\n4. \"Do\" is an auxiliary verb, and is the main verb.\n5. Therefore \"Do when working\" contains the main verb, and indicates what is the work that we do when we are working.\n6. \"Chef\" refers to someone who works in a restaurant or on a ship.\n7. In fact the chef is working in the evening, so we use \"Does that chef\" to refer to the chef.\n8. It means \"What does the Chef does when working in the evening\" is an interrobatory sentence, the subject is the chef. The answer the subject is the object in a sentence, so we are looking for \"when working\", which is the answer. \n9. The subject is a cook, an auxiliary verb isn't required because we have the subject. What cook do when he is working becomes the verbal part.\n10.

It is also an apparatus where humans don't live like on a spaceship. \n\nThe sentence is asking us to choose an appliance that uses water and soap.\nThis sentence doesn't require the name of an organism or a natural occurrence or a company, just an apparatus.\nLooking at the options, the washing machine is the only choice that uses water and soap, the only apparatus among the options, and the one that is most complex among them because it uses water and soap, but it isn\u2019t too complex since we wash clothes in it once in a while.\n\nSo the answer is B: washing machine\n\nAnswer: B: washing machine", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

We don't put  anything on the sides of plates because they are flat, except perhaps a glass, so our answer is not C: on one side of a plates.\n4. Next we rule out option E: on one side of the plate, because the plates are flat.\n5. The choice D: on one side of plate has an error in it. It should be 'on of side of a plate'.

{"text": "The movie has this fragile man (as described in the sentence) doing something he hopes to do.\n### Instruction and Rationales\n1. The phrase \"his hope\" implies that the man is doing something with the intention of achieving something.\n2. This something relates to the question being answered.\n3. So the man hoping to do something is a condition for answering the question being asked.\n4. The question is asking what a person is hoping to be.\n5. This is asking for a type of person who is a suitable candidate according to the movie description.\n\nThe sentence requires us to identify a suitable type of this man who has qualities the opposite of the man described.\n\n6. The first type of person, 'undestroyable', is not suitable in this context, as it is not in line with the movie description.\n7. The second type of person, 'unbreakable', is generally used to refer simply to people's physical toughness or resilience, and is not a suitable type.\n8. The third type of person, 'indestructible', can be used to refer to objects or materials that are exceptionally tough and resistant to damage or destruction, but it doesn't necessarily refer to people and isn't suitable for the question.\n9. The fourth type of person, 'durable', is used to refer simply to the ability of objects to resist damage, wear, or corrosion, and isn't suitable.\n10. The fifth type of person, 'invisible', is not a suitable choice as it can refer to people who are not easily noticeable or who are hard to see in a crowd.\n11. The only suitable type of person according to the question is 'durable', and 'indestructible' comes closest to being a plausible type. However, durable is more likely to be the intention of the sentence.\n12. Therefore, the likely answer is D: durable.\n\n### Demo Response:\n\nA fragile man in the movie is hoping to find a person opposite him who is [durable]\n\n### Instructions and Rationales\n\n#### 1.

Choices: \nA: one hundred dollars B: 100 cents C: one thousand dollars D: one dollar E: fifteen cents\nRationales:1. First of all we must figure out what type of noun is being referred to. Because \u2018money\u2019 can be both a noun and a verb and the question does not specify whether it refers to a specific amount or general income, so initially we focus on a specific amount.\n2. We cannot say 'fifteen cents' since that is a specific amount of money.\n3. As much as we like the sound of using a 'one' as the answer, we cannot use 1, as that is not a noun.\n4. We cannot say $100 as that isn't a noun or spelled correctly.\n5. The answer is not 100 dollars because, although $100 is a large amount of money, it is not more than most salaries, so '$100' fits here.\n6. There isn't any $1000 in the sentence so B is not an option.\n7. We can't use 'one thousand' as that isn't spelled correctly.\n8.

They are:\n\n- The word 'when' is in past form, so the verb'reserve' must be in past form (been reserved) too.\n\n- The word motel is a noun, a person can reserve 'a motel room' but he cannot reserve 'a motel'.\n\n- There are no words between'motel' and 'room', thus there is no verb after'motel'.\n\n- The word hotel room is not a correct expression in English. There are many types of room in hotels, but only one of them is called 'hotel room'.\n\n### Choices:  A, B, C, D and E\n\n### Rationales:\nThe past form of the verb 'be' is 'been'\n- *I be good at swimming. (The sentence is wrong form.)\n- ***I have been good at swimming.\n- I have been good at swimling.\n- I've been good at swimming in the past.\n- The correct sentence should contain 'have been' because 'be' is in the past form.\n\n- A motel is a type of hotel, a person can 'Reserve a room' in a hotel, but he cannot 'Reserve a motel'.\n- \n- After'motel', there is no appropriate verb form in the sentence.\n- A motel room is not the same expression as 'hotel room\" \n\nBased on all the four points, the answer is C: locker room.\nAnswer: C: Locker room\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question correctly.\n> Input: Which of the following statements is true?

E: It is often windy in London.\n\n### Rationale:\n> In the sentence: \"It is likely that the weather will be sunny this week\", 'likely' is used here to denote an expected condition in the future or a possibility, not a certainty", "answer": "B: motel room"}

Next, we see option \"B\", \"republican party\". If we look again the sentence we read that he didn't live with old people. We know that he wouldn't live with old democrat citizens so republican is clearly the wrong answer.\n\n4.

{"text": "A: being happy\n\n### Rationale:\n\"someone\" implies that the action being asked about is done by someone. That being said, the sentence doesn't ask about someone's _reaction_ to fun but actually someone _doing_ something fun.\n\nOption A: someone being happy - a good answer since happiness is one of things we do when we are fun is mentioned.\n\nOption B: someone expressing glee cannot be an answer unless its use in an ambiguous context has become popularized.\n\nRationale for \"someone doing glee\" - The word \"glee\" means fun. Therefore, a \"gleeful\" party is a party with a lot of fun. So, \"glee\" can indicate \"happiness\" as fun is linked with happiness.\nHowever, \"glee\" is usually used to talk about _emotion_ rather than _action_. Though we can describe glee as \"happiness\", we use the term \"glee\" to describe the emotion that we feel when we get/display happiness.\n\nRationales for \"someone smoking\" - Though we often use the term 'fun' to describe drinking and smoking, the verb fun doesn't actually use the term smoking. We use the verb \"smoke\" to describe the action of \"smoking\" which implies that the speaker does not want the answer to have anything to do with \"smoking\" even though it might be related to fun.\n\n### Rationales for other options:\nOption C- stress relief isn't an activity but a way to reduce anxiety which is unrelated to fun.\n\nOption D- stress relief doesn't even relate to fun which is why it has been omitted.\n\nOption E- \"may laugh\" only adds more confusion to the sentence. \"laughter\" is not a commonly used term to convey fun and there are more suitable terms - \"jokes\" \"pranks\" \"sarcasm\" \"funny\" - that are used to talk about fun.\n\n## Demonstration: \n#### Instruction:Complete the text with the correct preposition.\n\n```\n    ___ this year's meeting, _\n    ___ all ___ will be expected to\n    ___ our policies of  (1)____.\n    ___ (2)______", "answer": "E: may laugh"}

{"text": "A: cook some dinner\n\n### Rationale:\nInput: The question asks what they had to do because they didn't have any food in the house. \nChoices:  A: return to work. \nRationales: The first option,'return to work', does not fit into the sentence. \nChoice B: eat. \nRational: Eat is a verb meaning to ingest food. In this context, they are specifically not talking about ingesting food.\n\nChoice C: go back to Work. \nRationals: Option C is a noun meaning an action going back to work. In this context, the words they or they'd is plural, therefore this word does not match.\n\n\nChoice D: make food.\n\nRationals:  Option D is a verb meaning to prepare a meal, which does not make sense in this context, as that is contrary to the meaning of the sentence, in which they wanted to eat at home (rather than prepare a meal).\n\nChoice E: get food\nRationals: The question asked which activity they needed to partake in as a consequence of not having any food in their fridge. Choice E satisfies this.\n\n### Answer: A: Cook dinner\n\n### Note: For some reason only option B was marked wrong. It's very unclear why this option was marked incorrect.", "answer": "E: get food"}
{"text": "Answer:  C: see exhibits\n\n### Rationales: 1:\"Curiosity\" refers to the desire to learn more about something, and \"something\" can be a subject of interest.\n2. The sentence gives us two pieces of information:\n3. That we are curious about something and that we cannot leave our house.\n4. So, the best way to satisfy our curiosity despite us not being able to leave the house is to look at exhibits.\n5. \"Exhibits\" are usually found in museums or other such places, and we can look at them remotely too. Thus, \"see exhibits\" is the most appropriate answer.\n\n### Input :What are the characteristics of a bicycle? Choices:  A. An example B. A pedel driven vehicle with no engine C.

The third option, C: have time to, doesn't have the \"do\" needed in the request.\n11.

A supermarket is a store where we buy household necessities and often clothes and shoes, but it is not related to where someone would get a bag after someone else fills it.\n4.

A cat ladder allows a cat to move from one place to another on two or more levels.\n2. A towel can be placed on the furry carpet to be used by the cat to move around without getting its claws stuck on the carpet.\n3. A cat is used to getting on and off its bed, so it is useful to have a cat bed as a place for the cat to relax and nap in.\n4. The cat claws can be trimmed back to a reasonable size, thus ensuring that they don't end up stuck to the carpet.\n5. The last option doesn't really answer the question of what will help the cat not get its claws stuck in a carpet.\n6.

Choices:  A. plants B. plants that C. plants would D. plants he planted the next year E. plants he planted this year\nRationales:\n1. The phrase \"he chose\" tells us that the farmer chose from a list of items. However, we know what options he chose. That is birds feed, which is different from what he planted (plants he planted), and he planted them last year (plants he plants again the next year).\n2. The farmer chose a combination of things, and you could argue that \"what\" refers to the most basic thing.\n3. This means you can remove planted plants, and since you can't eat that, you don't have to worry about it.\n4. Since the sentence specifically states that the farmer chose what would be next year's plants, the only appropriate option is B: plants. \n5. Finally, only plants would be next year' plants, so none of the other options fit. \n6. Hence, the answer choice is B: plants.\nAnswer: B Plants\n\n### Input \nThe boy bought a shirt that was _____.

{"text": "Demonstration:\n1. The question is worded as follows: \"What do (whom)/does (what) a carpenter use to drill holes?\"\n2. The subject of the sentence is the carpenter, so we need a noun to complete the noun phrase 'a carpenter.'\n3. Option A: drill. A drill is a tool that a carpenter might use to create holes in different media.

E: A spy\n\nDemonstratiion:\nThe structure of the sentence is that which party in terms of the document should sign it. For this reason, we need to look at the document type.\n\nLooking at the options\n\n> 1.  The sentence states that the sender or the receiver should be present to sign the document. The other party, a witness, is not necessary for this document.\n\n> 2.  There is reference to 2 witnesses. So 3 is not an option.\n\nAs stated earlier, we need to look out for document type.\n\n> 3. Since the sender, or the receiver is not required to sign the document, a witness is also unnecessary.\n\n> 4. There are two possible options, notary and spy. Now there cannot be a spy because it would be unbelievable if such a person exists. Thus, we remove it from the options and focus on the remaining candidate, notary. We know there is a notary because the previous sentence stated that the document will be notarised and then, the document will be stamped by him. Therefore, we are confident that the answer will be D: The notary.\n\n> 5. This one will be the spy because it is unnecessary since the document will be notorised.\n\n> 6.

{"text": "C: Drug store\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe question asks for a suitable place to get a moistener. The first option, A: bathroom, is not suitable because although you may use the bathroom to get a moisturer, it would not be the most convenient location.\nThe second option, B: purse, is not suitable because it does not have a moistener.\nThe third option, C: drug store, is suitable because it frequently sells moisturizers.\nThe fourth option, D: hand lotion, is not suitable because a hand lotion is not always referred to as a moistener, and the sentence doesn't specifically mention that a hand lotion can be used as a moistener. So, option C: drug store is the answer.\n\n### Extensions and Questions\n\n1. The word \"moistener\" refers to an agent that adds moisture to skin.\n2. According to the sentence, it is a good place to get it.\n\n3. The sentence is asking whether a moistener is a good thing to buy; therefore, the correct choice should be the first option, B: drug store.\n\n4. Option A: bathroom is not suitable because although many people may think that it's a good place to buy it as it offers moisture, the moistener that the question is asking for would usually be a product specifically designed to add moisture to skin, not to rinse off excess water.\n5. Option B: purse is not suitable because this object does not have any moistener that can be used on the face.\n6. Option C: Drug store is suitable because it's a place where a wide range of moisturizers are sold.\n7. Option D: Hand lotion, is not valid because although it may include moisturizer as an ingredient, it is not a substance used to add it to the skin.\n8. Consequently, the most fitting of all options is B: Drug store, because it is suitable and the one meant by the sentence.\n\n### Question:\n\nThe first instruction stated that a noun was required to replace \"the complex machine\". Since \"machine\" is an adjective, an adjective should be used. The options are:", "answer": "C: drug store"}

The input sentence asks what kind of land area is likely to contain the largest number of villagers\n2. The first answer, rurual area, refers to a region that is mostly located outside of major cities, including fields and woods.\n3. Although rural areas can contain populations, it is not the best choice, because there can be some remote villages in these areas, but many rural areas are quite isolated, making is unlikely to have a large village.\n4. The second choice, big city, refers to major urban centers with densely populated cities.\n5. It is unlikely for a large village to be located within a big city, as cities are usually too busy urban areas to have a large number of villagers who live nearby. \n6. The third answer, suburb, is a common term that refers to neighborhoods located outside urban centers.\n7. However,'suburb' is generally used to refer more to an area outside a big city, rather than a remote village, so it doesn't answer the prompt accurately.\n8. The fourth answer, ohio, refers to the state in the Midwast region in the US. \n9. 'Ohio' can't answer the question because it is not a specific geographical area, and it is not very likely to house a large village with many residents.\n10. Finally, 'countryside' is also not a suitable answer, as it doesn't directly provide an answer to the prompt asking for the location containing the largest number of villager.\n11. Therefore, the only correct answer is the 5th one: BIG CITY. \n12. The answer is B: big city.\n\n### Input Choices and Solution\nInput: What is the area likely to contain a large group of people called a crowd?

This is a very open-ended question and it leaves a lot of room for interpretation.\n2. We might want to add a prepositional phrase as well, such as \"which appears on the surface of the Moon,\" for clarification. \n3. To answer this question we need to think about where shadows usually appear.\n4. There are many different possible answers to this question. \n5. These possible answers will depend the circumstances of the question. For example, if it is given in the context of the natural world, then we could add the sun as a possible answer.\n6. However, if it is given within the context of the built environment, we could add options such as a building or a bridge. \n7. In the given sentences, there are no mentions of the sun or buildings, which is part of what makes it a good question.

A survey in Britain of the toys and games used by parents and children showed that boys chose games or toys based on speed, power, and strength. Girls were more likely to pick games involving creativity.\n\n## Response:\n![response][image2]\n\n## Rationale\n\n1. One word or phrase from each of the sentences in the text can be used to fill in the gap.\n2. To choose children's toys based on speed and power is stereotyped.\n3.

{"text": "Choice C : Meet people  is the correct answer to the above question. \n### Rationales: 1- Meet is a verb and requires a direct object hence C: meet people is the only feasible choice 2 - meet is also a noun as you can meet a specific person meaning you can meet a relative or someone 3- The sentence structure is a simple clause that has a verb in it so C: meet people  is very much correct. \n### Answer: Choice C : meet people\n\n### Input : Where does he usually go to unwind? Choices:  B: party C: home D: school E: library\n\n### Response : Choice D : school \n\n### Rational: 1 - The sentence talks about \"unwind\" that gives you another clue for where he usually goes to because \"unwind = relax\" 2 - Party is an action verb and therefore it is a suitable answer to the question in option A:  and B:  that are asking where does he usually goes. That is the problem. 3 - He \"usually\" goes to school. It is not an action word and it describes the situation. So D: go to school \nis the correct answer. \n###  Answer : Choice D : School.\n\n### Input;  Where do we usually go swimming? Choices:  C: the sea D: the river E: swimming pool\n### Response Choice D :  river is more feasible \n### Rationale: 1 - The use of the term \"usually \" suggests that the subject \"we\" go to certain places \"swimminigg\". 2 - The sentence also tells you that it refers to the \"Sea or river\" as it says where we usually \"swim\". 3 - It is always better to provide a specific answer as it adds more detail to sentences that are vague by nature.\n\n### Answer : Choice D: river\n\n### Input Where do you park your car?

{"text": "### Rationale: LIPS is part of MOUTH. The MOUTH is of HUMAN. THEREFORE HAND is HUMAN\n\nRationale: 1. The question is asking which part of a human body the lips are on.\n2. Our first instinct is to rule out option A: mouth, because that\u2019s not the part of a human being that the lips are on. However, if we look at it carefully, it might be possible to say that the mouth is the lips of the human body.\n3. Option B: jars and face, is inappropriate because although jars and faces are both objects that we might put our mouth on, it\u2019s not what the question is asking about.\n4. Option C: Kentucky Fried Chicken, is a food type.\n5. Option D: hand does fit the structure of the question, but it refers specifically to a hand, not the human body.\n6. Finally, option E: human is exactly what the question asks for.\n7. There is no correct sentence that makes sense.\n8.

The sentence asks about the possible consequences of reckless driving, and the answer must reflect this.\n2. Option A: death seems to imply that the person will actually die, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for. Option B: get arrested may suggest that the driver will be punished, but we want to focus on the possible consequences of the driver\u2019s actions.\n3. Additionally, the sentence suggests that a car was involved; a person is not capable of driving a car, nor is a car capable of driving itself, so the only option that reflects this is option C: moving.\n4. Option D: using gas implies that the car may suddenly speed up, causing the death or injury of pedestrians, but it doesn\u2019 t relate to the driver him/ herself. \n5. Option E: may die fails to focus on the driver. \n6.

College classes are the place that he wants to be at, because that's where he should spend time studying for his report.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe instruction explains that we're looking for a location, not a person. So, option A: University doesn't make sense, given that James is a student there who has a report due. Option B: College class is the best match, as classes are where students can spend time studying. Option C: Classroom doesn't work, because James is a student studying elsewhere, not in a classroom. Option D: Classroom might seem like a reasonable choice, but it doesn't fit with the constraints of the question. Option E: Library would make sense for a librarian or other library staff member, but not for James, who is a student who may go to classes with books instead of libraries.\n\n### Output: James needs to write the report and go to college classes where he can spend most of his time.\n\n### Notes\n\n> *It's important to read the question closely before answering, so that you understand the constraints of the situation.

So, we can eliminate option B: medicine chests, and option C: armpits, since neither of them is a place to buy deodorant, and option A: medicine cabinet, since that isn't an available option.\n\nThere are five places you can go to \"buy\" deoderant, which are (in order):\n\n  * Option D: grocery stores\n  * Option E: kitchen\n  * Option C: drugstores\n  * Option B: Walmart\n  * Option A: Walgreens\n\nHowever, option D: grocery and option E: kitchen can be eliminated as places to buy deodorant. So, we're left with options A: Walgreens, B: Walmart, and C: drugstore.\n\nThe sentence can be modified by removing the word \"but,\" which means you should replace it with a suitable substitute. We can replace the word \"but\" with \"and.\"\n\nYou can \"buy\" (deodorant) at any of the following places:\nA) (Walgreens)\nB) (Walmart)\nC) (drugstore)\n\nNow, we have three choices. So, we combine each of the choices and we get:\n\n  * You can buy (deodorant) in (A)Walgreens, (B)Walmart, or (C)drugstore.\n\nAs a final note of importance: it's important to note that option C: drugstore is a redundant choice, since you would buy deoderant at a drugstore.\n\nYou can get rid of option C: drugstore to make another shorter sentence:\n\n  * Now you can buy (deodorants) at (A) Walgreens, (B Walmart, or (A) drugstores.\n\n\n### Input : What are the reasons for the decrease in traffic accidents?

Option B: James Hadley. Chase is a proper name, as it refers to a person, in this case, an author.\n3. Option A: Mark Twain, given as such is also a proper name, which refers to a person.\n4. Option C: Jane Austen. This is also a proper name which refers to a person, though it might be better to write it without the apostrophe (i.e., instead of Jane\u2019s, write Jane). This option and option E, T.S. Eliots are similar in the sense that they are the proper name of authors, but they occur in the reverse order, Eliot\u2019s first name appearing before his last.

A band consists of multiple instruments that may include stringed and brass instruments such as a viola and a cello. A symphony is an orchestra that may also consist of brass instruments.

Choices: A: chapter B: part C: character D: episode E: chapter F: topic G: page\nRationale: The first option, 'chapter', is an appropriate choice because the page itself has chapters, which are numbered sections in an organized sequence. The second option, \u201cpart\u201d, generally refers to a segment or section of a work or piece rather than the entire work, so it does not fit the sentence. \n\nAnswer: A: chapter", "answer": "D: orchestra"}
{"text": "**Response:**The answer is A: picnic basket.\n\n**Rationales:** \n1. The sentence asks us where small grapes are used the most often.\n2. \"Picnic basket\" is a phrase that indicates that small grapes will go into a bag. Thus, grapes are used most often when put into a picnic basket.\n3. We can therefore rule out the four incorrect answer options.\n4. The only remaining answer is \"picnic basket\", which best answers the question.\n5. Therefore, the answer for the sentence is A: picnic. \n6.

{"text": "Input: In war, your primary method of combat is to do what?  Rationales: 1) The correct answer can be determined by breaking down the question into two parts: 'In war, your primary' and'method of combat is to do'. As such,'method of combat' is the independent clause and 'do what' is the dependent clause. \n2) The first option, 'conquer the opponent', doesn't follow the correct part of speech; 'conquer' is a verb that can't be modified by 'what'.\n3) The second option, 'fight the enemy', is an example of an appropriate phrase which can complete the sentence.\n4) Next, the third option, 'join the army', is not a suitable answer because although it conveys the idea of fighting, it doesn't accurately reflect the primary method of combat.\n5) The next option, 'kill', is not a suitable response either. Though it is true that killing is part of combat, 'kill' isn't the primary method of combat in war, as suggested in the question.\n6) Hence, the correct response is B: fight the enemy.\nAnswer: A: fight the enemy\n\nInput:In war, your main aim is to defeat who? Choices: 1. A: the enemy 2. B: the opponent 3. C: the army 4. D. You\n\n### Response\nInput:In war your primary method of combat should be ______? Choices:  a. killing the enemy b. Fighting against enemy c. Flying to enemy d. joining army\n\n### Response \nThe question asks for your primary method of combat. Filling it in with \"flying to the enemy\" or \"being in the army\" would not make any sense. The only valid option that can fill in the blank is \"Killing enemy\", which is the second option to choose from. So, the answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B: killing the enemy\n\n<br>\n\nIf you do not completely understand it, please ask.

The sentence is asking about the one thing that all humans have on the head.\n2. The options can be answered by asking a question that starts with an antonym of \"all\". So, \"what animals do not have\" will give us all the possible antonyms.\n3. As horns don't grow on humans, B is wrong.\n4. So, A is incorrect, too.\n5. The word \"two\" in the question means \"two of the same thing\". Therefore, option C will not be correct as humans do not have horns.\n6. We will, therefore, choose B: two ears.\nAnswer: B -  two ears\n\n\n---\n\n# Instruction:\nWrite the letter of the vocabulary term that matches each of the letters in the words below.

{"text": "Makeup is meant to enhance a person\u2019s physical appearance. There are many reasons for doing so, such as finding oneself more attractive and improving one\u2019s self-confidence. However, while the result is often to look more desirable, the process doesn\u2019t always succeed in getting the desired compliments or making for interesting conversations. In many cases, people want to feel good about themselves or present themselves better to others.\n\n### Rationales:\n- Choice A: feel pleasure: Makeup is a part of a beauty routine and is not meant to gain pleasure. It is a way for a person to present themselves to the world. Makeup is not about feeling pleasure.\n- Choice B: look attractive: Makeup is not about getting attention from a particular person. It is to enhance a person's looks and to make them look like they are confident. Makeup is not a form of attractiveness.\n- Choice C: compliments: Although people may do makeup to look more attractive or to be pleasing, the goal is not necessarily to get compliments. People can get compliments for various reasons, such as their personality, or even their clothes, but makeup is a tool to enhance how they present themselves. Compliments cannot be used to describe the purpose of makeup. \n- Choice D: interesting experiences: Makeup is not meant to make an experience. People use makeup for different reasons, such as to make themselves feel more confident and to enhance their beauty. Makeup experiences are not a common topic of discussion. There are various interests, but makeup is not one of them.\n- Choice E: joy: Makeup is not simply about getting joy. People use makeup because of the benefits that it has on them.

B : a flasher C: It's a storm D: Lighting E: a big lighting.\n\n### Rationales: 1: You must understand you need to find noun for \"the ship\" to answer the question. Hence, the response will be either a noun of \"ship\", or a noun of a \"lightning\". That means you don't need to replace \"ship\" with \"lightning\" to make your response sentence true.\n2. \"it's\" doesn't have a subject, hence you don't need it as it is.\n3. \"lighting\" is grammatically incorrect, so you can't use it as a response since it's not grammatically correct.\n4.  \"a flasher\" does not answer the question correctly, since we don't want \"a\" in our response. Moreover, \"a flasher\" is not the correct way to ask someone who has a flash tattoo.\n5. The response is either A or B, but not A or C. You can rule out A in the beginning because it is just not the correct noun for \"the lightning\".\n6. \"D\" is a noun phrase, you don't use a noun phrase to write a response.

{"text": "1. \"Where\" generally refers to a location, so the first part of the sentence already gives an indication that the answer must be in some way related to a place.\n2. \"Might\" also indicates that there are a number of potential choices for James to keep his clipboard, and there doesn't have to be a single place where he keeps it.\n3. So James may have a certain amount of flexibility in his choice of location, though we don't know what that amount is.\n4. \"Keep\" may not actually refer to keeping the clipboard, but could also be used as a general term meaning that James probably stores it somewhere.\n5. After considering all of these potential explanations, we now make a quick check of option A: shelf, but this option is not suitable because shelves are generally used to keep things in a fixed position which isn't possible for the clipboard.\n6. This option is excluded from consideration. \n7. Next we check option C: desk, because desks can often hold various kinds of items, and this could include a clipboard.\n8. However, we can reject this option as well because a desk is often considered to be a more permanent form of storage, and placing a clipboard on a desk may not always be the most practical thing to do.\n9. Moving on to option D: office supply store, we see that this may be where James buys a clipboard, but it isn't a place where he would be expected to keep it.\n10. Further, he may not necessarily buy clipboards from this place, and even if he did, it still wouldn't be somewhere where he would keep them.\n11. As a result, this option is also excluded. \n12. We then check option E: school because schools often store items that are used in classes, including clipboards.\n13. However, this option is excluded again because James is not necessarily expected to keep his clipboard at school even though he does use it.\n14. Lastly, we reach the final option F: place of work.\n15. A place of work is generally a more permanent form of where one expects an item to be stored, and it fits easily after the word \"place\", so it works nicely in the sentence.\n16.

{"text": "### Rationale: 1. The question basically wants us to say where a bed chair should sit, so the answer should be a place where you use it.\n2. The term family room doesn\u2019t refer to a place, it refers to a person's family. The word 'family' denotes the whole set of people, there is no specific room we can point to as a member's room. Hence, it does not fit the question and can be eliminated as an option.\n3. Looking at choices B: den and D: wood. Choice B: den is a place where you could sit on a chair, but we don't refer to the chair as the place where you sit on it, and the den is not the place where the bean bag chair sits on.\n4. So that eliminates choice B: den. 5. The next option, D: wood is not a place to sit where the bean bag chair will be placed.\n6. So that also eliminates choice D: wood.\n7. Choice E: floor is a place to sit, however we can't say that it is a place to place a bean bag chair on top of it.\n8. So, this also should be eliminated.\n9. So that leaves choice C: family room.\n10. It refers to a place where everyone in the family sits. It has the ability to hold two people and it has to place something on top of it.

The sentence tells us that whatever the event was, the exact details are not available to the writer.\n2. So, the sentence asks about that event.\n3. The first and third options, \"incident\" and \"conversation\" are not correct, as they have similar meanings and \"incident\" is a prevalent, more common term.\n4.

The second sentence is asking for the fuel. \n    A fuel doesn't come from petrol station.\n\n3. \"Gasoline\" means \"petrol\". It is only a synonym for the word petrol.

{"text": "The sentence makes us guess what he finally found.\n\nThe first choice, 'gorgeous', is used for someone who is unparalleled in beauty but isn't suitable as it doesn't relate to what he'd finally found: someone who shared the same lack of beauty as he did.\n\nThe second choice, 'handsome', though it is used to refer to someone who is typically good-looking, it isn't relevant as it doesn\u2019t mean he had found someone \u2018ugly like him\u2019.\n\nThe third choice, 'pleasing', while it might be used to describe someone who is good-looking, there is nothing in the sentence that would indicate that he wouldn\u2019t be the one stick out at the party.\n\nThe fourth choice, 'glorious', is a word that is rarely used in contemporary parlance; it would likely be better to use 'handsome', as it was used in the first option.\n\nThe fifth choice, 'pretty beautiful', is a noun phrase, which refers to a woman who can be beautiful, the word 'pretty' used to qualify her as beautiful. Though it is a valid term, it can't be easily applied to what he'd found.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E) beautiful.\n\nAnswer: beautiful\n\n### Input:-He said, \"How did you do that?\" Choices: A: I didn't know.

The first choice, 'I didn't know' is an incorrect answer to the question because the man didn't ask how she'd performed it, he asked about the trick, and that wouldn't have been a suitable answer.\n2. Likewise, the second choice, 'I was impressed', would not reflect positively on the man's view of the feat of strength.\n3.

This is the sort of attitude that a mother might have towards her child, rather than being a relevant answer to the problem of greasy teenage hair.\nC: Mistakes are the sort of thing that parents, not teenagers, tend to be concerned about.\nD: This is the closest answer to the question, and is the best answer. \nE: The question does not refer to satisfaction, but greasy hair.\n### Answer: D: cleanliness\n\n### Input:\"You are a sore loser,\" \"You are a bad loser.\n\n### 1: \nIf there were two people arguing, I would say (or write) \"You always lose, because you never accept losing.\"\n(This is different from saying, \"You are a poor loser\" which does not give the sense of \"losing always.\"\nThe \"sore\" phrase can be used in place of the \"bad\" in the question.\n\n## Response:\n1. The first thing to realize is that the sentence gives us a specific rule. The second thing is that the phrase \"sore loser\" was written to cover the possibility that the interlocutor might be an inexperienced speaker. To follow the logic, we have two options:\n2. A: \"You are always a loser,\" or\n3. B: \"You always lose, for you never accept losing,\"\n\nThe first option, A, implies that the listener is always a loser. However, in the sentence \"You are a sore/bad loser,\" \"sore/bad\" describe the bad quality of someone who loses. Therefore, the statement doesn't describe the listener as a loser, and the second option is the correct one.\n\n### Answer: B: \"You always loose for you never accept losing.\"", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}
{"text": "The answer is medium.\n\nRationales:\n1. From the question, we know that the sentence is about proper dining etiquette in formal settings. The sentence implies that the question refers to a social gathering, not eating at home, which can easily go wrong in its complexity.\n2. So, we eliminate options A: sit and C: talk, simply because you would sit when eating at a formal place.\n3. Looking at option B: being sociable, we know that being sociable is not always required when having food at a formal setting. In fact, some formal mealtime events require more of an observance of formal etiquette and decorum rather than the social niceties of casual events.\n4. From this we can eliminate option B: being socially\n5. Looking at option D is drinking. Though you could drink a beverage at formal mealtime gathering, it definitely is not one of the most important factors of what you do.\n6. Therefore, the only answer for the question is medium.\n7. This answers the question by choosing D: medium. \n8. Hence answer is D: medium", "answer": "A: sit"}

Otherwise, it would mean you are putting the germ into food or yourself.\n5) Option E: mouth refers to a place of eating.\n6) As for 'ear', as it is not a location, the question is still unanswered.\n7) In summary, 'ear' is the only option left.\n8) Therefore, the answer is B.\n\n\nD: mouth E: ear, The final answer is E: ear.

{"text": "C: injury\n\n### Rationales\n\nChoice A: happiness\nChoice B: sore muscle\nChoice D: perfection\nChoices A to C are incorrect because the meaning they convey in the sentence is not necessary. In other words, the question seeks a suitable term, one that is directly relevant to the context.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because it refers to something that causes pain and suffering, and therefore does not align with the tone of the sentence.\n\nThe correct choice, choice C, is an 'injury'.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nIn your own words, and using only the information contained within the text, create a response to the following:\n\n### Instructor: Explain in your own words what this sentence means\n\nI was going to put the milk in the refrigerator so that, it will not go bad too soon.\n\n### Answer:\nSo, I'm going to put it in the refrigerate or it will not go bad quickly\n\n### Notes: The term 'too' refers to something which is 'in excess' or 'excessive'. For instance, an answer is correct if we say 'It will go bad', it will go bad or bad quickly, but we cannot say 'It will go (too) bad'.\n### Reason: 'too' is used with an adjective, 'bad' is an adjective. But it would be incorrect to say 'It will go too bad.\n### Rationale: \n'Too' is used with a few exceptions in the following ways: (i) before a word that describes quantity (e.g. a large amount, many things),  (ii with a verb (e.g. to work, to stay),  (iii before adjectives such as: big enough, good enough, great, terrible, ugly ( e.g. I love you too much),  (iv before certain numbers describing quantity (e.g.) many things, a large amount, and  (v) before 'enough'.\n### Correct answer:\nit is a correct response.

Choices:\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: If your house is damaged due to a fire, you will have what with it? Choices: 1. damage 2. harm 3. problem 4. cost 5. expense 6. loss 7. trouble\nRationales:\n1. The word 'what,' on its own, does not appear in a question about a house.\n2. The first two choices, 'damage' and 'harm,' are inappropriate because they are nouns that refer to something that has already happened: 'damage' is already the word 'damage' that indicates what has already happened, and 'harm' is already the word harm that is often used to refer to an injury or damage.\n3. The next two choices, 'problem' and 'cost,' are not suitable because they involve mental processes, cognitive activity, or action, and none of these factors appear in the question.\n4. The phrase 'have with it' is grammatically incorrect since 'it' refers to a house, not a problem, cost, expense, etc. In addition, the phrase is redundant.\n5. The last two options, 'losing' and 'trouble,' are the only ones that fit the structure of the question and make sense grammatically.\n6. They also have an emphasis on what the man will have to deal with if his house is damaged by fire. This emphasis on 'loss,' for example, gives the impression that losing something is not", "answer": "B: better job"}

The library doesn't tell us where information is usually obtained. \n4. The book refers to how information is stored, not where information is stored. Thus is not an option.\n5.

Similarly, options B (construction site) and C (shopping complex) are not suitable because they aren't places where people typically find metal rods.\n\n3. Option D, which suggests an automobile engine as the location of the metal rod, is not a suitable response because the rod isn't something that the engine would have naturally or unavoidably lost.\n\n4.

We immediately eliminate choices A and E: low lands and everglades. These are not locations in New York.\n4.

The answer is 'a' or 'an' in front of any word that has a letter beginning with a consonant.\n3.  If the answer would have been headache, then the words headache and pain would have to be joined together by 'and'.\n4.  So, we discard option D: headache from the list of options.\n5.

There is not enough information to be given in the multiple choice options.\n\n6. We are not given any information as to why the child is meeting their friend.\n\n7.  Therefore, we don't know when this action might be done.\n\n8. The question is asking what a child might do before going to play and there must be a gap, it doesn't say when the action will happen.\n\n9. We can exclude A: laugh as laugh is an action not a reason.\n10. If a child laughs that is not the reason why they are meeting their friend.\n11. It is the action that is the reason for meeting the friend.\n12. We can also exclude B: sit because it is not the reason as stated in the question that a child might do what.\n13. The question gives no information that a child might sit.\n14. Choice C cannot be chosen because that does not fit in with the question.\n15.

The word \"you\" may be missing from the form of the sentence, but it is implied and understood to be there. The first choice \"see work\" simply means to look at the work, not to get the grade.\n### Rationale  2: The second choice \"practice\" refers to activities which are done to prepare for taking a test, but would be performed as part of studying. It doesn't refer to getting a grade for the test.\n### Rational 3: The third choice \"quiz\" means test or assessment. However, it may be taken by a person to determine his/her knowledge on a certain subject. In this example though, it is not taken by the person to determine his/ her grade.\n###Rational 4: The fourth choice \"homework\" would mean all the work given to a student to do from the school teacher. It does not mean the part that has been marked and is included in the grade assigned by the teacher. The fifth choice \"school grade\" answers the question completely by implying the entirety of the grade that is given to the student at the end of the course. The other choices do not answer the question at all.\n### RATIONALE 5: The term 'grade', as the penultimate choice, can be inferred as referring to the overall sum of the grades the students receive at the end of the term.

{"text": "1. \"What emotion does getting Paid lead to\" is a WHAT QUESTION.\n2. The WHAT part asks for an emotion.\n3. There can be no emotion without getting PAID, so \"getting PAID\" is an option.\n4. We check \"sorrow\" first.\n5. \"sorrow\" cannot relate to getting PAID as that would mean that you receive PAID to be SORRY.\n6. Next we check \"paying BILLS\"\n7. \"paid\" and BILLS are both nouns used with their singular form. This makes \"paying bills\" an option.\n8. Now that we know \"paying bills\", we can use our logic skills to see \"getting Paid leads to\" means that \"getting Paid\" and \"paying bills\". These 2 can make a question and get the option \"What is the question that getting paid will lead to getting paid and paying bills?\"\n9. We can also know that the emotion we are looking for comes after\" getting paid and paying the bills\". this means the question is\" Which emotion comes AFTER \"paid and paying the bils\".\n9. After we do this, we know that that option is E\"SPENDING MONEY\".\n10. We know that \"spending Money\" is the answer because in life we are getting paid and spend that money but we never get the emotions after we spend the money or use it to buy something.\n11. We are being paid so we could live and then when we spend it on what to eat, to buy and do we still have that emotion.\n12.

These details are important and significant, as they highlight the building's distinctive qualities. \n3. However, without including all the keywords stated in the instruction, the response is incomplete and does not adequately reflect the context of the building. \n4. For example, if someone answers \"building\" alone, without mentioning the geographical location or the activity, they are missing the first keyword (\"hill\") and the third keyword (\"together\"). If they respond with \"hill\" alone, they have missed the first and second keywords. \n5. Likewise, if someone responds with \"building\" and \"stone\" together, they have left out the keyword \"geographical location,\" which is the second keyword in the instruction. \n6. The fourth keyword, \"together,\" is a verb that refers to the activity of building the building. It should be included in a response that accurately reflects the sentence. \n7.

{"text": "Write a response that appropriately responds to the request.\n\nRationales:1. The sentence, 'how is someone who loves TV likely to feel about remote?' is asking to find the commonality between someone who loves TV and someone who loves remote.\n2. Therefore, there will be 2 nouns and 1 verb.\n3. The sentence starts off with \"how is someone\". So, our first noun will be one that fits the sentence.\n4. This refers to a being.\n5. Next, we check if the noun is an appropriate one.\n6. The first choice is A: attached (to someone), and is not the correct noun because the sentence doesn't refer to the being being attached to the TV or to the remote but to the being being attached in general. So, it can\u2019t be our noun.\n7. The second choice is B: nostalgic, and it refers to a being but not in general, so it can\u2019t be the noun.\n8. The next choice is C: companionable. This is another word for love. This would be the appropriate noun that fits the sentence. So, we move on with the first choice, the only remaining one, the verb that comes after.\n9. D: likely, E: close The only verb that is common for our two nouns is \"feel\". It can be D: likely or E: close. However, 'likely' describes uncertainty whereas 'close' does not. In addition, close could be referring to proximity.\n    \nSo, the answer is C: companionable\n\n### A.

Then click the \"Recheck\" button and identify the error.\n\nThe answer is A: A: friend.\nRationales: One of the 5 choices is A: friend. Friend is a word that is not gramatically correct for the sentence.\nThe second choice, B: true is the only correct answer.\n\n> **Correct answer:** B: true\n\n### B.

{"text": "It is clear from the context and the provided options that the correct response would be the adjective, \"helpless\", which is defined as \"unable to avoid or ward off (an evil or misfortune) as in lacking power or control\", which, indeed, would describe how I feel when confronted with a vast space.\n\nAnswer: D:   helpless\n\n**Instruction: Write about the following topic in sufficient detail to completely address it.\nTopic : Your response should be in the form of a paragraph of seven to ten sentences.\n\nDemonstration: I know this isn't real. I am trying to explain how I felt when confronting such a vast space.\nThe night sky is vast. I will be lost. I don't know what I am doing here. I am so lost.\nRationales:   1. The question is asking you to write about your experience. You're supposed to be telling a reader about what it was like in your own words.\n2. This question is not asking the reader to write what you felt, it is asking you to write what you felt.\n3. We use the word 'is' at the beginning of the sentence to tell the reader that the words in the sentence are my subjective feelings.\n4. The verb, 'am' is telling the reader that I know what I am doing in writing my response. I am aware of what is being asked.\n5. The phrase, 'trying to explain' is the reason for this response. I am trying to give the reader a better idea of what it felt like.\n6. \"I am so lost\" is telling the reader that my subjective feelings were like that.\n7. Therefore the response should be:\nI know this isn't really real. It is just a dream but I am trying to give you an idea of how I felt. I was lost in my own head, in my own place and time. This is an explanation of what it felt like and my feelings on the situation.\n\nAnswer:\nThis isn\u2019t really real. I am actually trying to tell you about what it is like to be lost and my feelings about being lost. Being lost is really scary and it makes you think a lot about things. You think a lot about where you are and where you are going. You think of everyone you know and wonder why you are not", "answer": "B: insignificant"}

It feels as though he has the sole intention of paying bills. However, being actively in the workforce doesn\u2019t have to entail the purpose of making money.

Choices: A: looked just alike to those who knew them B: were indistinguishable C: differed in appearance D: looked familiar E: didn't recognize each other\nRationales:\n\n1. \"The two of them\" suggests a pair of people is under consideration.\n2. The sentence says they are indistinguishable so they look the same to everyone. The sentence doesn't say anything about how the two people know each other.\n3. Hence, \"they looked alike\" doesn't work correctly in the sentence.\n4.

'Retirement home' is not a suitable choice because it's quite an unusual and uncommon way to refer to a building that's frequented by children. \n6.

{"text": "Answer: C: shocked\n\n### Rationales: 1.)\nInput: When he touched the exposed wire. \nRationales: We see from the question that the answer requires a verb phrase, like \"to find it surprising\".\nInput: He shouldn't have found... \nRationales:: We note that he should NOT find it surprising, and from this we can already say 'he did find it surprising'. Hence, we now know that the verb phrase should be in the third conditional form ('if + past perfect', 'would + have + past participle').\nInput: found it surprise. \nRationaless: the verb phrase is required to read 'found it surprising'.\nInput: He shouldn\u2019t have found it surprise.  Rationaless: The verb phrase has the right structure, but it reads weirdly when 'found it surprise'. We can infer from this that the verb and object of the sentence have a relationship between them, \nRationaless:: Hence, we can see that 'it' is connected with'shouldn't have found'.\n\n### Output:When he touched the wired he shouldn't have ________. Choices:  A:(had + not + touch) the exposed wire B:(hadn't + not + touch)the exposed wire C: found it surprise D: found it surprising E: should't find surprising\n\n### Rationale:We must look for the two key words in the sentence.

Bears are usually shy animals that avoid human contact whenever possible, but when they do approach humans, they will generally not attack unless provoked. In recent times however, grizzly bear attacks have been reported, typically associated with a provocation such as a human approaching an occupied den. The bears often become aggressive because they are protecting their young. In the case of the grizzly bear however, there is no immediate danger from a bite. Attacks may still result in injury, and the wounds inflicted by a bear may cause infection if not treated immediately. The best treatment is to remain calm and protective of any visible injuries, which will encourage the bear to leave.\n\n### Task One  :\n### Instrucions : Answer the multiple choice question using what is taught in the text.\n\n\n### Instructon:\nWhat is the meaning of North American Brow bear?\n\n### Dem", "answer": "C: red barn"}

Verbs change tense when being used in passive voice, for instance the verb 'want' changes to 'to be needed'. \n5. \"Stored in the fridge\" - The phrase \"stored in the ____\" is not an indication of a quality or a condition but an indication of where the turkey was to be kept from spoilage. \n6. \"Made the turkey not be spoiling\" is a sentence with the word \"requir(e|ed)\" included, an example of a mandatory answer. \n7. \"Had a fridge\" - This is a sentence with an indirect and passive form, an example of a wrong answer. \n8. \"Have a turkey\" - This is a grammatically wrong and a nonsensical sentence. \n9. \"Kept it a turkey\" -This sentence is grammatically wrong and also nonsensical. \n\n### Summary: \nThe instructions involve a choice of among the answers to complete the instructions.\n\n1.

{"text": "The answer would be A: orchestra, not B: school band, not C: music store, not D: opera house, for sure not E: home.\n\n### Rationales: 1.\u201cWhere\u201d in the question tells us that the answer to the question requires a location.\n\n2. Though a bass clarinet can be used in a school band, a \u201cschool band\u201d is not necessarily a place where one gets a Clarinet. The same goes for the option \u201cmusic store\u201d -- it can be where one can get a bass clarinet, but it wouldn\u2019t be specific to a bass clarinet.\n\n3. The option \u201copera house\u201d is simply not something that one can go to to take \u201chome\u201d.\n\n4. And, finally, \u201chome\u201d is a place where you keep a bass clarinet, not something you go to to buy or rent one.\n\n5. Therefore, the answer to the question, as asked, is A: orchestra.\n\n### Input : Where would you get a bassoon to put on your desk? Choices:A: school band B: music store C: home D: opera house\n### Response:\n\n### Rationale 1.\tThe sentence asks where bassoon is to be found.\n\n### Explanation:\nWhen you have an idea of the word \u201cto put on your desk\u201d, we know you are only talking about a place where you can find it.\n\n### Key words: \u201cWhere\u201d + \u201cput on your desk\u201d and \u201cto take home\u201d, the words help you define what would be the right answer.\n\n### Correct choice: The answer is B: music store.\n\n### The answer to this question is that you would not find the bassoon in a school band. Though the school band has it in them, it\u2019s hard to find it in a music store. You surely cannot get a bassoon in home, this has nothing to do with home in this question. You can neither find it in the school band or the music store. For this choice, the one is a place where you can probably get it, another is a place where you have to get it, the third one is neither and the last choice is out of question.", "answer": "C: music store"}

The most likely place for classes (a.k.a. a room) would be a school (the other choices are offices, hotels, and offices), and the fact that it's a school implies that it's not a school/building on a very small scale.\n3. The only reason it could be called large is because it is a \"very large school\".\n4. So, we choose C: school.\n\n### Answer:\n### Answer: C: school\nAnswer: C: school\n\n### Input(1): You are visiting the city _______ you were supposed to buy ice cream.

Choices:  B:- where C:- to where D:- where to E/- where from\n\n### Response 1:\n### Rationale 1:\n1. Given the context, the city we are talking about has to be a place where ice cream is sold. As the other choices are different places where ice cream can't be found, they can be discarded.\n2. This sentence suggests that we are in the city of our choice already, and what we are looking for is a place to buy ice cream, which can't be a place \"we were supposed to buy icecream\" because we are not supposed to buy them yet.\n3. This sentence suggests that the woman in question is looking for a location that she can buy ice cream from while in the city, rather than a place that she is supposed to buy ice creams, like a grocery store or a convenience store. She can't buy ice creams from other places because she is supposed to buy them in a store, not in the city they are found in.\n4. Since we now have the location she is looking for, we now have the answer.\n\n### Rationales 2:\n1. Given that there are different places that ice cream can be found, there are no other places where icecream can be found in a city.\n2. Ice creams are bought at stores. St", "answer": "A: school"}

{"text": "**A: desire** \\*\\*\\\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The sentence states that a requirement or a precondition for buying a product is... __________. \n2. A) \"Desire\" is the best option among all the available options because it means a wish to acquire a particular thing and is a necessary precursor to actually acquiring something. \n3. \"Needs\" in the given options refers to those that are considered necessary for survival or existence. \n4. In the above context of buying products, \"Needs\" would not be adequate, as buying products is not related to survival. \n5. Next, we will eliminate the option saying \"time\", as it is not necessary. \n6. The option \"spending money\" is excluded because it is not a necessary requirement to buy products, as some products do not need spending money to purchase.\n7. The option mentioning \"money\" can be ruled out for the same reason. \n8. So, the given options only leaves \"desire\", which means \"a wish to acquire (a thing)\", the best option among all. \n9.

Choices: A: Shell B: Caltex C: ARCO D: Chevron E: 7-eleven F: Mobil\nRationales:\n1. The premise of this sentence says that there are four major global brands of petrol, so there are only four options available.\n2. The first four options are incorrect because they are not brands of petrol.\n3. The fifth option, 'Caltex', is the abbreviation for Caltex, Limited, a large oil conglomerate that provides products and services in refined fuels, petroleum, and convenience stores.\n4. This option is not actually a brand of petrol at all because petrol is a brand, but it is more likely that it is referring to a fuel company.\n5. The sixth and final option is '7-eleven', but it is also not a fuel company since it is a very large convenience store retailer, selling a wide variety of products such as snacks, drinks, ice-cream, hot food, and even some branded petrols.\n6. Therefore, the answer and the correct choice is F: Mobil.\n\nAnswer: F: Mobil\n\n### Input 1: Which is more expensive?

{"text": "The term \"care (n): have a feeling or regard for (someone or something) and generally show it by one's actions\" so there're words such as \"unfeeling\" but also: \"unfeeling : incapable of or not bothered by feeling\" and \"negligence : an act of failing to exercise proper care\". All of these can be considered for the sentence.\n\n### Choice: It has been known to many that in some countries, when a child is deemed deficient in something, that child is removed from its home. It is said that they are placed in a group home where they will be kept, until they are old enough to no longer require assistance. As such, the group home essentially serves as a holding pen for juvenile criminals. What kind of home is this? Choices: 1) an orphanage 2) a halfway house 3) a foster home 4) a group home 5) a daycare center\n\nThe correct answer is B (group home). A group home for juvenile crimnials sounds an awful institution; it's no wonder we are asked to define the term. This type of home houses 80% more kids than regular foster homes. They're large. Group homes serve a large number of kids. They're usually owned by the government and are staffed by people hired to work there.

After being upgraded to spacecraft, one of their options was hotel, but the word \"upgraded\" implies that the spacecraft was the final choice and was what they really wanted.\n\n3. Correct answer : **B:   spacecraft**\n4. Input:She is a beautiful, brave girl.   \nChoice:\n\n### Response\n1. **Explation:** Brave is an adjective that describes an attribute or property of the girl. However, beautiful describes the girl, and not an attribute or property. Because the sentence says \"girl\", the sentence is describing what a girl is like. Therefore, the sentence is asking for an adjective. \n2. Rationale :The question has two parts : \"She is a beautiful, brave girl.\" What is the adjective that fits the two parts? \n3. Correct answer: The words in the question must fit together, so adjectives that describe both the \"brave\" part and the \"beautiful\" part cannot fit.

{"text": "If I'm understanding your prompt correctly, the crab is scuttling but straining when he moves meaning that the crab is trying to move but struggles to do so. What is impeding him?\n\nThe crab may be struggling because he's weighed down by sand or rocks in his shell; otherwise, the crab would not be scuttling.\n\nAs an example, if the crab's shell is filled with sand instead of sea water, the crab would struggle to move about because of this extra weight.\n\nWe can therefore rule out (A) and (B) based on this criteria.\n\nOption C (tidepools) does not match here because tide pools are only small sections of the ocean that have tides. It does not have to do with weight or movement and I think this is what the prompt is trying to get at.\n\nOption D (current) does not match here, I think, because the current in the ocean has to do with moving the ocean surface by itself such as water being moved by wind or waves.\n\nOption E (cooking pot) is unlikely to be what the prompt implies because the cooking pot wouldn't have to impede the crab's movement because the crab is still in the ocean.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this is (D) the current because this answers the prompt of the crab struggling to move.\n\n### Input- The far end was obscured by a large cobblestone.

{"text": "1. B: cargo ship\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Instructional Demonstration: \n\n### Input : The new student was having difficulty in a foreign language. He was trying to find the classroom.\n### Demonstraion: \n\n## Rationales \n\n### 1. The sentence \"The new student was having difficulty\" tells us that the student was having some trouble so we are looking for words that would mean difficult for something. Since we already know from the sentence that \"he was trying to find the\" classroom, we are looking for words for 'finding' something.\n\n###2. So, the question becomes:\"The new student was having (a noun for difficult in finding) in (a preposition).\"\n\n###3. The first option is 'difficulty'. It is the incorrect answer because although difficulty can refer to difficulties someone might encounter, it does NOT refer to how to find difficulty, so it is not suitable here.\n\n###4. The next option is 'easy'. It is incorrect for the same reason as difficulty-difficulty does not mean easy.\n\n###5. The next option is confusion. This is the correct answer because confusion can mean \"state of being confusing\" and can refer to difficulty. \n\n###6. The next option is perplexity. This is a form of perplexity meaning being in something that is strange and confusing. But it does not mean difficulty.\n\n###7. The next option is hardship. Hardship is generally used for difficult circumstances or difficult times, so it does not reflect the sentence as it says that the student is trying to find the class.\n\n###8. Therefore, the correct answer is confusion.\n\n### Answer: C: Confusion\n\n### Instructor's Comments\n\nThis example is very useful to look at for demonstration of how to answer this question type, because it uses multiple word choice, but it is a question that could be answered with a word in place of the underlined phrase.\n\n## Instructions: Answer the following multiple-choice.\n\n## Instructor Demonstration: Input: What did you find at the beach?

The business doesn\u2019t require anyone. It didn\u2019t require them to have a great day or do well either. Hence, the choices C: hope for peace and D: have a great are ruled out as well.\n\n4. The only choice that does fit the clause \u2018what did the business\u2026\u2019 is A: wear shoes.\n\nHence, the answer to the sentence is A: wear shoeses.\n\n### Input :How did you find your way in the dark? Choices: \n* A: A compass\n* B: A cellphone\n* C: A car\n* D: A moon. \n* E: A map\n\n### Response :\n* Demonstration: \nThe sentence asks for a n a ut h n o r m that a p e r s o n u s ed in the dark.\n\n1. There is no way a person would use a compass to find their way in the dark. \n\n2. A cellphone is an electronic device that one uses to make calls and receive calls. We do not use cell phones to find our way around. Hence, option B: a cellphone is ruled out.\n3. The car is an automobile. It is not used to find your way in the park. so, option C: A car is ruled out.\n4. The moon is a celestial object. It is not an item used to find one\u2019s way. Hence, option D: A moon is ruled out as well. \n\n5. Therefore, the only option that answers the question correctly is A: A map\n\nHence, The answer is A: A map.\n\n### Demo:\n\n### Input  : How should the project start? \nChoices", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

But since James is cooking in his kitchen in the sentence, it cannot be the answer.\nChoice E, pantry, doesn\u2019t make sense as that isn\u2019t a potato, but a variety of canned foods.\nSo, the answer to the question is casserole, not B, but A.\n\n\nDemonstration:Choices:  A: spices B: kimono C: sushi D: knives E: sake\nRationales: The question is asking which place to find what. Since there is a specific place that is mentioned, we are sure it's the answer.\nFor Choice A, spices; there were many spices in the store, but in the question it asked, which place to find what, it should be a specific store or something that is not a spice that is the answer. However, a lot of people buy spices from the grocery stores, so answer A is not that specific.\nChoice B, kimono, fits the question, as the question is asking which place is the what, and the clothing store is the answer.\nNext Choice C, sushi, is the answer as the question is asking where to find sushi, and a fish market would be an answer, Choice D, knives, is not the answer because it doesn't fit the sentence or the question.\nChoice E, sake, doesn't fit the question or the sentence, but it is a thing to eat, so it will not be the answer.\n\n### Input How does the food taste?

{"text": "The sun was out but the temperature was rapidly changing, it was really becoming colder.\n### Instruction/Demonstration: 1.'sun' is the noun/subject and the verb/predicate 'was out'.\n2.'sun' is pronoun while 'was' is verb\n3. Sun will not change in temperature. the sun will begin to change, the temperature will rapidly change.\n4. Rationales: It is a noun because'sun' is not a pronoun, nor an impersonal it. The phrase 'rapping becomes' implies that only the pronoun'sun' can be changed and hence it must be a noun. It is also an adjective because adjectives modify nouns and the word 'rapid' is modifying'sun'. From the word 'change', we can clearly identify that the subject is sun which is later modified by phrase 'rapidly changing'. The word 'temperature' is being modified by 'rapidly' meaning that temperature is subject to modification. Moreover, the word 'rapidly' is modifying the phrase 'temperature changing' which makes it difficult to conclude whether temperature is doing the action or not. Here, the sentence asks you 'what are you getting at?' hence 'change' can not be the answer for the question.", "answer": "E: heat up"}
{"text": "The answer is D: own bathroom.\n\n### Rationales\n1.The sentence is asking where his wife asked him to look, and it\u2019s pretty obvious that asking someone to look in the nightstand isn\u2019t a proper place to look for deodorant.\n2.In option A: grocery, the grocery store is definitely a place to buy food, but it isn\u2019t a proper spot to use your deodorant.\n3.Option B: the nightstand is a small table in a bedroom; but if he needs deodorant, he has to look elsewhere because the answer is obvious. Thus, option A: grocary store, option B: the nightstand, option C: the armpit are incorrect.\n4.The word \u201cown\u201d in the sentence is used to signify a location where he could have looked, so the only option left is D: his own bathroom, with \u201cbathroom\u201d being the appropriate noun to complete the sentence. \n5.In E: medicine chest, medicine means medical equipment, the cabinet that holds medicines.\n6.In other words, there is no medicine chest in his bathroom, but yes, there may be a refrigerator or a cabinet for storage.\n7.Thus, the answer is D: his ownbathroom.\n8.Therefore, the answer is A: his own bathroom.", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}

The sentence \"When we are thankful we do X\" is similar. \n4. There must be something that tells you you should feel thankful. \n5. You should then show what that makes you feel by doing x.\n6. x can be anything you wish. If you do a dance or show a grin, then it is something emotional like appreciation or happiness.\n7.

In fact, if \"if\" didn't refer to a hypothetical event, the sentence should say \"I will put my had on the fire\".\n2.

The paragraph should contain the following:\n  * At least one complex or embedded sentence: that is, a sentence containing a dependent clause and an independent clause or a sentence containing a coordinating conjunction.\n  * A topic sentence or sentence or a topic phrase at the beginning of the paragraph.\n  * At least two sentences with a particular purpose phrase. A purpose phrase is an expression of purpose, often using the verb to be, an expression of time, or an expression of manner (see the Grammar and Pronunciation section).\n  * An overall purpose phrase at the end of the paragraph, indicating the purpose of the whole paragraph. This is sometimes called a concluding phrase or concluding clause.\n\n### Answer:Here are the key features in the paragraph you have written.\n\nAt the start of the paper, there is a complex sentence.

Choices:  What did she want to know?\n\n### Rationale:\n\nA. Because she wanted the names, she could look them up later, and then call them by their first name any time she wanted.\n\nB. Because it is much easier to do things (like call them by their first rather than their last name) when you do them often and it's routine, she can call people by their first name very easily.\n\nC.

The question asks us to choose a suitable verb to complete the sentence, and we must then choose the correct one.\n\nThe first option, \"board ship,\" is an idiomatic way of saying to leave a situation or to escape from it.\n\nI was surprised when she boarded the ship the next day.\n\nThe second option, \"groceries shop\" is not appropriate because we would not call shopping a verb.\n\nI always go groceries shopping on weekends.\n\nThe third option, \"feel happy\" is not a suitable choice because it is not a verb.\n\nShe always feels happy when she comes home.\n\nThe fourth option, \"shout at\" is not appropriate because it is more commonly used in the past tense.\n\nThe sentence is asking for something you would do now or in the future, so the more correct option is \"boat ship.\" We are given five choices, and the correct choice is \"boat ship\".\n\nThe five choice is the right one \n\n### Input : Does the tree have two trunk?

We are given four options which each represent a different response, and we must choose the correct verb form (yes or no).\n\nThe first option A: \"yes\" is the correct response because the sentence tells us that only \"yes\" answers the question.\n\nYes, it does have two trunks.\n\nThe second and third options are not appropriate because they tell us more about the tree than the sentence does.\n\nMy tree has two trunks because it comes from a tropical climate.\n\nThe fourth response, \" no\" is the appropriate choice because it gives us the verb \"does\" and the subject of \"it\" which is \"tree\".\nNo, my tree", "answer": "D: feel happy"}
{"text": "### E: small case\n### Rationales:\n1. The sentences asks for a suitable nnoun to describe a place to store the chess pawn.\n2. The first choice, A: chess set, is not suitable because, although a chess set, or table could possibly have a small space to store pawns, it would not be suitable to store pawns permanently, and it is not generally considered a suitable place to store pawns.\n3. The idea of pawns being stored in small cases is suggested in the next two options, B: strategy and C: toy store.\n4. Both B: strategy and C; toy store use the words pawns and small, and both are suggestions of suitable places to store pawns for strategy games and toys, both of which have pawns. However, again, neither of these options are a suitable place to store the pawns permanently.\n5. Option D: chess game is also not a suitable place to store them because a chess game, or place where a chess game is often played, does not typically have a small space to hold pawns.\n6. The final option, E: small case, is the only option that fits the description requested in the sentence. It is a small space that can hold pawns and is suitable to store pawn permanently. Therefore, the only logical answer is E: small case.\n\n### Response 2:\n### A. Chess Game\n### Rational:\n1. It is not a reasonable assumption that chess games come with small, holding cases that are suitable for storing pawns.\n2. The reason for the case not being suitable or a good place to store chess pawns is that Chess is not a game involving pawns.\n\n### E. Small Case\n\n### Rationals:\n1. Firstly, The sentence asks for a noun to describe a suitable place for storing the chess pawn and this one is a case\n2. The first two possibilities of answering are incorrect.

Breath is only used as a noun in phrases such as \"breath taking\", but never as a verb.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. \"They\" and \"don't\" provide two clues that we can use for the sentence.\n2. The first clue that tells us that this question is about a group of fish, is the \"they\". The second clue, the use of the word, \"don't,\" tells us that we are looking for something unusual.\n3. Both clues work together to direct us towards fish that do something unusual.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be a noun that is used to describe a fish.\n5.

{"text": "### Rationales: 1 If I have a forgiving attic toward someone, what do the receive? \n2. We immediately rule out the incorrect choice, A: redemption.\n3. \"Redemption\" doesn't seem to describe a state of getting something.\n4. \"A forgiving attic \" is a state of heart or mind.\n5. The word \"receive\" describes something we get from someone.\n6. When we get a state of heart, the only way to get it is through another's act.\n7. So that means we receive a state of heart.\n8. Next we look at choice B: isolation. If someone doesn't have a forgiving heart, they might be isolated, but the other doesn't receive anything by forgiving someone with an isolating attitude.\n9. A forgiving heart is positive, while isolation brings only negatives.\n10. Therefore, choice C: absolution, is likely to be the correct choice.\n11. Option C: absolution, refers to complete forgiveness, and when we forgive others, they are forgiven for their wrongdoings. \n12. Hence, choice C: absolve/forgive is the correct choice as the person forgives another.\n13.

The next option, Dumpster, can be used for storing garbage, but it doesn\u2019 think that\u2019ll be an appropriate response to where do you watch garbage? \n5. Next option is landfill, which doesn\u2019t match the sentence in any way. \n6. The lastly, option is fox news, which is used to talk about trash, in politics or the media. \n7.

He asked the desk assistant if she could tell him the way. (1) How did she respond? (2) What did she ask him for? \n1.The sentence asks us about the action that the desk assistant took to respond to the man. \n2.The sentence asks us the action that the desking assistant took that the man.\nAnswer: the action in the response could be the same as the question or different than the question.\nIn this case, it is different. For example, if the question asked how to get somewhere, the response could be by car or by foot.\n\n### Choices for Input 1: A: I don\u2019t know. B: I don\u2019t think so. C: That\u2019s wrong! D: How could you even ask that? E: You can\u2019t! F: Well that\u2019s interesting!\n\n### Answer for Input 1:  E: You can\u2019\nThe first choice B: I don't think so is wrong. It would be logical if the desk assistant wasn\u2019t sure if she could tell the man the way, but the sentence did not use \u2018if\u2019 so that wouldn\u2019t be correct. The second choice, C: \u2018That\u2019s wrong\u2019 is wrong because if she said that, she\u2019d be insulting the man. The third choice, D: \u2018How could you even ask that\u2019 is also wrong.

A bunch of islands 2. Many islands 3. An assortment of islands 4. A set of islands 5. An amalgamation of islands\n\n### Response\n\nThe correct choice is 'A bunch of islands', which correctly defines and clarifies 'group of islands'. The second choice, 'A bunch of islands' is a group, and it is a set of islands. 'Bunch' is a common word that can refer to an arrangement of things. 'Many' can refer to a group of things since the same word is used for people. 'Many' usually refers to a number of things, but it doesn't describe arrangement or quantity. 'An assortment of islands' is a very incorrect answer. An assortment is a grouping of dissimilar things. But 'group of islands' here refers to a setting or setting of islands, which is a common understanding of this expression. A collection of isles may or may not be'similar' to each other. 'Group of islands' doesn't mean a collection of islands. The last choice has also very wrong usage of the word'set'. Set is a word that has very specific meaning in statistics. These words are not interchangeable. The correct choice is option 1. Answer: A: Bunch\n\n### Input question: Are there three options to the question 'is the question answered correctly, or no'?

{"text": "A: beaver\nB: animal\nC: wooded area\nD: body of water\n\n### Response Explanation\n1. The sentence asks about the feature that a beaver blocks.\n2. The first word is 'beaver'. We need a corresponding noun to describe the feature that a beavers blocks.\n3. 'Beaver' is a collective noun that refers to the animal. \n4. So to write the response, first we need to describe 'beaver' into'specific animal'.\n5. Then, we need to use a singular noun to describe 'the feature that a beaver blocks'.\n6. But, 'a feature is indefinite since it is one of something and we cannot specify the type of feature.\n7. But'specific animal' is an adjective that we can use to describe the animal's characteristics.\n8. Then, we can make singular noun to describe the 'the feature that a specific animal blocks'.\n9. 'Body of water' is used as an indefinite noun.\n10. And 'zoo' is a place that contains animals.\n11. And 'books' is where we write words or information.\n12. So the ruling noun is'specific animal'.\n13. Then, the features that a specific animal blocks are the body of water and zoos.\n14. Next, we need to combine specific animal and body of water to form one adjective.\n15. Then, we form one subject and verb to answer the question.\n16. When writing the noun-forming part after beaver, we can write either beaver or the beaver.\n\n### Input : When I was little, I wanted to be.

Choices:   A. in the corner of the porch B. on the side porch C. in the middle of the porch D. in the corner of porch E. in the center of the porch\nRationales:     1. In the sentence, the word anywhere refers to the fact that dog can sit down anywhere (in any location) in the house. Anywhere is a place where a dog can sit. 2. We are looking for a location, so we can immediately discard option A: in the corner of the  porch. 3. Option B: in the side porch can be used to express a location or a direction. So, we need to eliminate the location aspect of it. This option doesn\u2019t answer the question. 4. Looking at option C: in the middle of the  porch, we can eliminate it. Middle can refer to a particular point or location. So, we don\u2019t know if this option includes the center of the porce or the middle of the porce, as in middle part of the porce. Hence, we need to eliminate option too. 5. Looking at option D. in the corner in the porch, corner could be referring to any corner of the porch. So, because we cannot be sure as to which corner is referred to, we need to eliminate this option as well. 6.

{"text": "The sentence states that people need to find ways of coming together, implying that there are ways to meet with other people. The third option, 'group together' is an activity or action that people perform, as opposed to a state or position. To meet with other people, there has to be an environment, so 'place' or 'location' is more suitable options. The first option, \"believe in god\" describes a state of having faith in god. While that can be an important way to meet people, it\u2019s not about meeting each other as much as about faith and religion. The sentences talks about finding ways to come together, so something related to people meeting each other is more required. The second option, pay bills, doesn't reflect meeting each other. The fourth option, \"enjoy themselves\" implies that the people are already together, which isn't what the sentence asks for. 'Face each other', the last option, is another action or activity, which doesn't fit the question either. \n\nThe only option that describes a state of people meeting and not being an action or activity, is 'place'. It's the most suitable word for the answer because meeting people can't depend on an action or activity. It needs a location, so the answer is E: place.", "answer": "C: group together"}
{"text": "A: relaxation \n\nDirections: Input:The last man to cross the finish line is the? Choices:  winner A: loser B: race competitor C: athlete D: prize competitor E: run winner\nRationales: In the race scenario, the runners who finish last are usually not counted or considered as part of the competition. Since the finish line is the last place where someone can cross, the last one to cross is not a competitor of the race. So, he isn't a loser or participant of the race, and the correct answer cannot be options A: loser or B: race competitor.\n\nNext, the question asks for the correct person to describe the winner of the race scenario. This is usually the runner who passed the finish line first. He is also the athlete that took first place in the race competition. Therefore the option C: athlete is correct.\nSimilarly, if there were several runners crossing the finish line at the same time, we would have the option of race competitors, and the one that finished first in terms of time would also be counted as winner of the race in terms of position.

Since we are looking for 'why', the 'effort the school had made to changing' is the subject. The answer can only logically follow the subject. Looking at the options, 'ignore' is not logical since ignoring efforts is not why we would not change. 'Enforce' doesn't work since this answer choice doesn't explain why. 'Authoritarian', 'yerll at', and 'avoid' do not belong in a multiple choice question, they're phrases and not a choice. The last choice is 'yell at'.

The answer that we are looking for is inkwell.\nThe word \u2018pen\u2019 in the sentence could be replaced with any pronoun. This sentence can be rephrased to ask \u201cWhat did flop-pen-washer-soaker people use to absorb ink?\u201d The pronoun in the place of \u2018pen\u2019 must be an object. The sentence becomes clearer once the pronoun is added to the picture of the sentence.

According to the United States Supreme Court, the case was that Catholic Social Services of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia did not need to make foster care placements outside of the same-sex coupled homes. The Philadelphia Department of Human Services also restricted faith-based organizations' services, from Catholic Social Services' foster care services, and the Philadelphia Department of Human Services was supposed to change its policies by following equal policies for all faith-based agencies and allowing the faith-based agency to provide services without involving the city of Philadelphia in the process.", "answer": "C: garden"}

{"text": "The response that best completes the task will demonstrate an understanding of the question and a solid command of the language required. Your response should begin with the first sentence in which you paraphrase and respond to the prompt.\n\nRationales:\n\n1. The prompt tells us that there are several consequences that a certain action can have on the person who did the action. The prompt then focuses us on the consequences of a single event.\n2. Here we see this through the phrasing at the start: \"of stabbing a stranger...\" In this phrase, the stabbing is the action, and the stranger is the result, the consequence.\n3. Once we know that the action is a stranger, the phrase that comes after \"the family of the victim did... is to refer to a specific action. \n\n4. \"Did something\" sounds ambiguous because it could refer to either the family or to the victim. However, the prompt then narrows down the choice to the family. We can't just decide to use \"victim's family\" either, as it would result in two actions occurring, which is not what the sentence wants\n5. We can notice this because the question marks the two choices left and the answer is in the question itself: \"... The family...\" This means the family took an action.\n6. The choices for did something are as follows: \"... bleeding.\" We don't have family and victim all together as one action. The victim can't bleed... but the family can.\n7. Answer A: bleeding is the right choice.\n8. Answer: A: bleeding\n\n### Input 1 : The students who didn't study passed by the class without knowing anything about the test.

'Where' is an interrogative word, so the rest of the sentence will be a question, i.e. a question beginning with 'Where'. We then look for any preposition at the start of the sentence. In this case, there are none, so there is no need to use 'Where'. Instead, we use 'in', which becomes the subject of the sentence, followed by 'w' for the verb 'is'.\n\nWe then look at the list of answers, and decide that the only answer that makes sense and fits into the context of the sentence is 'open country'.\n\n### Input : __________________\n\n### Input 2 : __________________", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}

No lake in North Carolina B: A lot of cactus in North Carolina C: 70's era in North Carolina D: not a lot of ozone in North Carolina E: no fish in North Carolina\n\n### Response:-\nThis question was about whether North Carolina has a lake (which it does), so this answer isn't an option. But since the question didn't specify which lake, A. No lake in north Carolina is probably the correct answer because it's not a correct answer to question of if North Carolina has a lake or not.\n\n### Response to answer\n1. Lake: a large body of water surrounded by land.\n2. Choice A doesn't make sense because North Carolina definitely has a lake, and they would certainly know that. \"There is no lake\" is an obvious lie, so they would never answer with that.\n3. Choice B is also not a logical response because North Carolina does not and has not had anything to do with cactus.\n4. Choice C is incorrect because it is in the wrong tense. It would be correct to say \"70's era\", but it should not be, \"70's ERA in North Carolina\".\n5. Choice D is incorrect because although it's a \"common knowledge\" fact that a lot of ozone is in North Carolina, it is not correct because the person is specifically asking if there is a lake in North Carolina, not if there is a lot of ozone there.\n6. Choice E is incorrect because it's possible North Carolina does not have fish. It is in fact not known if North Carolina has fish or not, so this option would technically be correct, though very unlikely.\n7. Therefore A. No lake in N.

Choices:  N: the people I work for B: the people C: these people D: these ones E: them\nRationales: To answer this question you must know what is singular and what is plural.\n1. The first choice, N: the people I  work for, is a complete noun phrase. 'people I work for' is a compound noun while 'the people I work for' is not compound noun.\n2.

{"text": "Answer A\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We know the word \"where\" so we can assume the question requires a location.\n\n2. The question asks about the location where the peanut butter can be stored.\n3. So we could say that \"where\" could be the jar it was bought from, or the container where it was bought.\n4. Option A: container is the answer in this case.\n\n### Input/Instruction:\n\n### Response/Demonstration:\nAnswer B\n\n### Rationale:\n\n### Input\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Demostration\nRationale:\nAnswer:\n\nAn abstract noun is a concept, idea, or quality. Examples include: happiness, courage, and kindness. Some words are abstract nouns by themselves, as in \"the courage to face death.\" Others are concrete nouns, or the \"crowds of courageous people\" or the \"courageous soldiers.\"\n\n#### Rationale:\n1. We understand that the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d in the sentence is referring to the concrete nouns (\u201ccrowds\u201d and \u201csoldiers\u201d); therefore, in the sentence, \u2018courageous\u2019 is an (abstract) noun.\n2. For this reason, it is called an Abstract (Count) Noun.\n3. However, if someone says \u201ccourage is hard to face death\u201d, this sentence is referring to a person who is courageous (\u2018cunningly fearless or daring\u2019), or \u2018manly courage\u2019.\n4. The sentence states that \"everyone knows that courageous men are not usually cowards\u201d, which makes clear that courage should not be thought of \u201cthe kind of courage (or kind of man) who faces death\u201d. \n\n#### Example:\n\n> The courageous men always fight for what they believe.\n\n5. Thus here, \"courageous\" refers to a type of people rather than an abstraction, which is an adjective.\n6. Therefore, here, \"men\" is the Subject, and it means the word \"courageous\" is the Adjective; and it follows the verb \"fight\".\n7. This is referred to as a subject-verb pairing\n\n7. As we can see, \u201ccourage", "answer": "C: pantry"}
{"text": "```\nInput:Where do you usually go to spend a quiet evening? Choices: A: home B: school C: library D: university\n\nRationales:\n1. The word 'usually' tells us that the question refers to a frequently visited location.\n2. We can immediately rule Out option A: home because if you're going to spend a quiet evening, home would be a location you'd go home to, which doesn't necessarily answer the question.\n3. Next, we check option B: school. If you're going to be spending a quiet evening, chances are you're doing it in the evenings, meaning'school' doesn't answer the questions.\n4. We then move on to option C:library, which is indeed a location you'd find quiet during the evenings. However, there's no reason to 'go to' the library unless you have a library card and need to return something, which isn't what the question is asking.\n5. Next, we look at option D: university. Universities are places where quiet studying generally occurs because people are studying there, but there's no reason for these two friends to get together to study while there are so many other quiet locations that were never mentioned.\n6. Option E: restaurant can only be answered correctly if there had been a mention that food was going to be shared and that food didn't have to be cooked at home, otherwise this would be the wrong answer to the question.\n7. Therefore the answer can only be D: University.\n\n\n\n```", "answer": "D: movie"}

{"text": "*Rationales:\n1. The grammatical construction the sentence starts with is a WH-ing clausal question (WH Questions) which ask us about what.\n2. A WH-ing clause includes 'Wh- word' the question word that's used to start the clause and the verb that is following that word.\n3.

The second option, B.: animal, is not suitable as they are not eating the plant itself. \n5. The third option, C.: flower petals, is not a suitable choice, as flower petals are not edible plants. \n6. The fourth option, D.: vegetable, can be considered as an acceptable answer, but it is more precise to refer to the \"plants\" instead of \"vegetables\", as we can grow a variety of plants in a garden, including vegetables.\n7.

{"text": "### Rationale\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: What are you looking at? Choices: \nA: the ceiling B: the window C: table D: the wall E: the floor\nRationales:\n1. What is \u201cyou\u201d referring to? The pronoun \u201cyou\u201d, when used without a subject, could be referring to anyone.\n2. \u201cAt\u201d implies that you are looking at something. Therefore, it\u2019s possible that you are looking at things on the ceiling, on the wall, on the floor, or on the window.\n3. \"Table\", the first choice, is a piece of furniture and doesn\u2019t provide sufficient context. \n4. Similarly, \"A: the ceiling\" implies that \"you\" could be looking at things on the wall, but a ceiling doesn\u2019t provide any additional information.\n5. Next, consider \"D: the wall\". This answer also fits the question's structure, but still does not provide sufficient context. It's true that the wall is what you can be looking at, but why are you looking at the wall?\n6. Another option is \"E: the floor\". This answer could also be correct. However, the word \u201cfloor\u201d by itself does not provide sufficient context, and doesn\u2019t adequately specify what we are looking at. So, the answer is ambiguous and could mean any floor in the building.\n7. The last possibility is \"B: the window\". The word \u201cwindow\u201d immediately gives you an idea of what is being referred to. It also follows logically that the \"\u2026 window\", in this context, refers to the objects in the window.\n8.

The second option, \u2018B: expend energy\u2019, is the correct option. A lot of exercise can help you relieve stress and relieve anxiety by helping you expend energy. Exercise can also be part of a lifestyle that helps you quit drinking or smoking.\n3. The third choice, \u2018D: stretch\u2019, does not accurately describe why exercise is a healthy way of dealing with addictions.\n4. The fourth choice, \u2018C: laugh\u2019, does not help addicts deal with their addictive impulses.\n5. The fifth answer, \u2018E: weigh\u2019, is not a suitable option, as although exercise can sometimes help you feel better by making you weigh less. Exercise does not directly help with addiction, it\u2019s more about the psychological benefits and how exercise helps the health of your body. Exercise can boost your ability to think clearly, improve your mood and even help you sleep better.\n6. The only correct option according to the text is \u2018B: expend\u2019, so choice B is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: B: expend\n\n### Instructions:Choose no more than 2 best answers from the following questions to answer the question below.\n\n### \n\n###  Answer: B, D\n\n### Rationale # 1:\nInput: 1) A pink dress would make a great addition to the wardrobe of 2) A 8 year old girl. Explanation: It shows that the target audience for the dress is 8 year old girl, thus we need to choose B or D as we have not specified a gender.\n\n### Rational # 2:\n Input: 1) A green dress might look great on 2) A 13cm model.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question and choose the option that best suits the sentence. \n\n### Rational:\n7. The question asks for a noun that should fill in the blank. The noun is a place that we get something from.\n8. 'Lost city of Atlantis' in the response is not a good option because although it is a noun that could be found on an atlas or in the dictionary, it doesn't describe a particular place.\n9. 'High school', an option, is a place of education, so it would be suitable if it was combined with the right sentence, but it doesn\u2019 t describe a place where we get anything.\n10. So, there is still a need for another place in the options. \n11. The fourth option, 'downtown area', is a location in a city where people from the suburbs or suburbs visit to get shopping items, so people will usually return to their original residence after they have completed their purchase.\n12. The last option of choices, 'the ocean floor', may appear to describe a place where people get things from, but it is not applicable to the sentence because it does not describe a place where people go to get something.\n13.

So, we cross off options A: fish market, B: pet shop, D: river, which are not natural environments for fish\n2. Next, to narrow down the options left, we see that the phrase \"live on his own\" doesn't really fit there. That is because a fish lives among other fish, or in one's fish tank.

{"text": "The most appropriate answer depends on the context. In this case, it seems like the sentence was likely intended to refer to a new individual as its conclusion and end of the reproduction process. The first choice, \"overpopulation\" could describe a high population of people, but it isn't the same as a new individual. The second choice, \"birth\" may refer to the process of reproduction but it doesn't describe anything beyond the reproduction process itself. The third choice, \"presents\" doesn't make sense. The fourth choice, \"propagation\" could mean the reproduction of something, but doesn't describe a new individual in the process of reproduction. Finally, the fifth choice, \"fun\" doesn't relate to reproduction at all. The only choice to complete the sentence is the sixth choice, \"new life.\"\n\n### Output:How long can human exist?\n\n### Rationale:\n\"Humans\" are typically a group of living beings, so the question should be asking how long human beings can exist. This answer refers to how long people can exist and not how long an individual is able to exist. Therefore, the correct answer is plural \"humans\". \n\nThe correct response should be \"Long enough to die.\" The sentence talks about how important having good health is and not how long human beings exist, so the second choice, \"As long as we are alive\" doesn\u00b4t satisfy the sentence. Also, \"We can exist without knowing it\" doesn't satisfy the sentence because the term \"existant\" refers to something that can be identified, so in this context, \"existent\" doesn't make much sense. The third and fourth choices are synonyms (\"Healthy\", \"Sound\"), so \"Healthy enough to die\" satisfies the sentence because that means that having good health is enough to die.

{"text": "Louisiana.\n\n### Rationales: 1: The phrase \u201clandlocked, southern state\u201d indicates a state in the southern United States that is completely surrounded by other states and bodies of water (so no coastline), so it has to be in the middle of the USA. 2: The term \u201csouth carolina\u201d refers to that state - a southern state in the U.S. - but there are 2 other states (Alabama and Tennessee) that are more south that it. Hence, we can disregard this. 3: The term \u201clouisiana\u201d refers to a state in the southern USA that lies on the gulf of mexico, so it does not fit the requirement for \u201clandlocked\u201d (although it is in the south). 4: The term \u201carkansas\u201d refers to a state that lies in the Southern US, on the Mississippi river, but the question asked us to find a \u201clandlocked, southern-state\u201d. It is not a \u201clandlocked state\u201d, so we can disregard it. 5: The only state left to choose from is \u201clouisiana\u201d or \u201cMississippi\u201d because the other two states mentioned (Alabama and Tennessee, respectively) is not part of the south. 6: Looking at \u201clouisiana\u201d. 7:  If you visit the state of \u201clouisiana\u201d, you can see animals in a zoo - which is something only humans can do, so it is safe to say that the person is a human being. 8: The question was about a person\u2019s location, so it would only be reasonable to use the answer for the location - that is, the state of Louisana. 9: The only place where they can be that fit the requirements is Louisiana.\n\n### Input:-What time is it in Tokyo? -What time is it in Paris?\n\n### Response:-Paris.\n\n### Justification: 1.

If a speaker does not have the ability to communicate the relevant information it is likely that the audience might not fully understand the message.\nThese are the only two people presented in the sentence. Hence, the answer \"learning\" is most likely.\n\nAnswer: Learning\n\n###  Input: What will we do after dinner today?

This is a question asking who the interlocutor is calling.\n3. \"Who\" refers to the interlocutor - the person making the call.\n\n4. \"Answer my phone calls\" is an instruction to the interlocutor to take action.\n5. We can immediately rule option A: B: myself. This indicates the interlocutor should answer the call.\n6. Same reasoning applies to B: I, as this indicates the interlocutor answering the call.\n7. Option C: myself is a word in the verb phrase \"answer my phone calls\".\n8. We need to figure out whether it is the interlocutor being referred or another individual.\n9. Since all other options are related to answering the call, we can eliminate C: myself.\n10. Next, we look at option D: I. This is basically saying \"answer my call\". Hence, this too refers to the interlocuter in the instruction to answer the phone call.\n11. Therefore, the answer to the interrogative should be D: I. \n12. Answer: D: I\n13.

{"text": "**Input:** \n>What is love when everyone feels it?\n\n**Rationales:**\n\n1. It is asking what is the meaning the word love when people all feel the same thing.\n2. The sentence suggests that everyone is feeling something that was previously unknown to be \"love\" and that because everyone is feeling it that they are not actually feeling love.\n3. We have two options here where A says 'contagious' which is the feeling that love is contagious in the form of spreading to people you love or through interactions.\n4. This doesn't quite describe the \"feeling when everyone feels it\" feeling. This suggests that everyone is feeling love but it isn't 'contagious love' or 'a feeling that love is contrabisous' it means people are feeling love and everyone is feeling the same thing.\n5. B says 'last forever' which suggest a long feeling of love or an on going feeling of love.\n6. This doesn't describe it exactly as it suggests everyone is feeling some type of on going love.\n7. C says 'painful' which doesn't describe the feeling of love everyone is actually feeling.\n8. D says 'wrong' which does suggest a slight misunderstanding on why everyone is feeling love but not love itself.\n9. Lastly E says 'blind' which describes the opposite case that we have already concluded as wrong, where everyone is feeling love but they are not understanding the feeling of love.\n10. This doesn't explain the whole 'everyone keeps feeling it' part which is why B is the best answer to this question.\n11.

{"text": "The first sentence introduces the topic and establishes the action. \"Humans\" is doing \"something.\" We don't know what that something is, but we can infer that it is related to reproduction. \nThe second sentence suggests the types of behaviors we might expect to see. This is where you can use deduction (to learn something you haven't been told). In most cases, the behaviors will be the opposite of the types of behaviors you encounter when a machine is malfunctioning. \nIn the case of this example, we know that we see people eating ice cream all the time. We see human beings \"making mistakes\" all the time, but, again, we don't tend to see them \"sitting down\" or doing things like \"hearing sounds.\" Therefore, the opposite of these behaviors must be the ones we expect when people are actively reproducing. \n\nThe response is:\n\n1. \"Have sex\" makes sense because it's the type of activity where something might 'come out' and be passed on to the next person.\n2. \"Make mistakes\" is not something we'd expect in this type of activity. We see a lot of people eating ice creams, but that doesn't mean they're reproducing.

What were researchers desperatly seeking? Choices: A: cure B: cause spots on the leaf C: healthy D: wellness E: ball stopped\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe sentence \"The disease was spreading....\" is a description of a situation, so it's used to give information about what's happening at a specific moment in time. It is not a question, so it doesn't expect a response.\n\nThe question asks about something that \"researchers were desperately seeking\", or what they were desperately searching for. It does not ask if the disease was spread by a specific thing (like the \"Leaf spot disease\", which is mentioned in the question). Therefore, it is not asking for an answer that provides specific details about the disease, and can be omitted from the question.\n\nTherefore, if the sentence had asked: \"What was causing the spread of the disease?\" the correct response would be \"the leaf spots\".\n\nIf the sentence asked: \"What were researchers desperation seeking?\", the correct response would be the correct answer.\n\nThus, the correct answer to \"What were researchers desparetly seeking?\" given the correct sentence structure is answer choice A: \"Cause\".", "answer": "E: cure"}

{"text": "Detailed solution:\n\n1. \"Nowadays\" tells us that the question is asking what an ancient gadget was used for in the modern era.\n2. \"People\" is a plural pronoun that requires at least two antecedents.\n3. \"have\" is a present participle that requires an object (has+P).\n4. We can use the pronoun 'ones' or 'a' to denote the personified subjects having the object of the sentence. \n5. So, the sentence requires a singular noun.\n6. \"a tiny calculator\" is a singular noun phrase.\n\n1. Looking at the verbs of the sentence, \"to have\", \"to be\" and no other verbs.\n2. We can conclude that the noun phrase, \"a tiny calculator\", is the object for the verbs.\n\n1. We can eliminate the first three sentences because they are not noun phrases and do not reflect the meaning of the sentence.\n\n1.

{"text": "Answer: A: heartburn\n\n### Explanation:\nFrom the previous questions, you have learnt how to use the word \"which\" to replace a pronoun that can be replaced by a pronoun and is followed by a preposition. \nWe can see from the instruction that we have to \"reply with a choice of verb that fits the context\". The verb we insert fits within the preposition followed by a pronoun. \nThe sentence reads:\n\n> I want to know where/which are the best hiking trails in the area.\nThis could be interpreted as either where or which. Both \"where\" and \"which\" could be pronouns, and both \"are\" could follow \"which\" and \"where\". \nTherefore, the above example of use \"where\" would mean which are the hiking trails while the use of \"which\" would mean where are the hiking tracks. \n\n### However, there is a little tricky difference between these two usages of \"which\" in the instruction. The first use of \"which\" is when you are looking for a specific thing or piece of information. \nIf, from the sentence, the subject could be \"best\", then that \"best\" would mean it's referring to the \"best\" hiking trails or tracks. \nSo, \"which\" would not need a subject because \"best\" would already be the subject. Therefore, the sentence would be:\n\n> Where are the best hikng trails in the area?\nThus, following the sentence, you would choose the choice that fits the subject and the context. The context here would be \"best\".\n\nIn contrast, the case when there is not a subject, it will be \"where\". \nYou can't have \"which\" when the subject isn't present. In these instances, the sentence would have been:\n\n> Where is the best hiking trail in the area?\nFrom the above sentences, we have understood how to use the word\" which\" in a sentence. The sentence structure will be: \"Where are [subject]?\" \n\nSo, it can be said that from \"where\", \"which\" is selected when \"best\" is the subject and \"which\" is selected \nwhen \"best hiking trail\" is the subject.\nThus, it is important to understand", "answer": "B: have fun"}

{"text": "It appears that option A: Order is not suitable because the sentence does not ask for an opinion.\n\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about an emotion rather than a physical movement or the quality of the process by which we get order.\n\n2. The expression is also used to describe the social order in which people are considered equal, regardless of their position in society. Therefore, 'order' is too broad in meaning and doesn't fit in the sentence. \n\n3. Option B: queue is commonly associated with a line of people waiting patiently to purchase products or utilize resources in a timely, orderly fashion. Thus, it is the most probable choice that fits the context of the question. \n\n4. However, the term 'queueing up' (the formation of a line to purchase or use a service ) does not fit the context of the question and the sentence structure. Since, 'queue' is a noun, and the sentence requires an adjective. Additionally, the first word, 'line', is an adjective as the second,'moving', indicates a physical movement. Hence, the correct answer is option B: queue. \n5. Option C: wait turn is not suitable because the first two words are a passive form of 'to wait' and thus don't directly answer our question. The word 'line' is not an option as the sentence is about the emotion while taking time to answer. Thus, 'wait turn' doesn't fit the context of the sentence and the structure of the sentence does not match up with the required answer. \n\n6. Option D: fatigue is not suitable since it is not a feeling or emotion and does not describe the situation where someone stands in line. It is also very broad in meaning and could fit a variety of situations. The sentence and the question are more narrow in scope than the general meaning.\n\n7. Option E: anger is not suitable, as the question doesn't suggest any reasons for anger or any conditions which cause it. Hence, 'anger' is not the correct answer. \n\n### Answer:  B: Queue\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question.\n\n## Questions Asked:\n\n# What are you doing?

So, please thoroughly read the question.\n\n\nInput: A very _____ thing happened yesterday. Choices:  A good: B bad C very: D much\nRationales:\n\n1. We first look for an adjective to describe the subject.\n2. \u2018Good\u2019 means something that is positive or has a happy connotation, and \u2018bad\u2019 means the opposite.\n3. So \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 are good (sorry!) adjectives, but not what we\u2019re looking for.\n4. \u2018Very\u2019 is an adverb that describes a situation or occurrence as very particular, and \u2018much\u2019 is an intensifier.\n5. In this case however, the subject, \u2018thing\u2019, isn\u2019t particular in nature and neither \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018much\u2019 are suitable adjectives to desrcibe it.\n6.

{"text": "Choices:  A: authentic B: logical C: legitimate D: real E: correct\n\nRationales:1. The options beginning with A: and B: are not correct because the sentences beginning with a pronoun (a pronoun is an indefinite pronoun used in place of a noun or a noun phrase) is followed by a verb, not an adjective or noun.\n2. The sentence is asking us what kind of certificate a handbag will have, we cannot put a noun phrase that doesn't have the required grammatical function in our response.\n3. This question is not asking about the contents of what the certificate states but about the certificate itself which is the what clause so we need a preposition as a response.\n\n4. That\u2019s why'real' and 'correct' are not correct answers.\n5. Finally, the answer is D: legitimate.\n6. This means the handbag will not have a piece of paper that states the handbag is legitimate.\n6  - A legitimate handbag is one that is authentic, not a forgery.\n\n### Input :Why is the earth always spinning?

'A' and 'B' : \nThe answer must state that the earth is always spinning.\n\n2. 'C' : \n'Away from the sun' is a prepositional phrase and cannot be used because to answer the question we need a verb phrase for this sentence.\n\n3. 'D' and 'E' : \n'By the sun' means that the earth is always facing the sun, i.e. spinning away from the sun. It is the opposite of 'Under the sun' which indicates that the earth is facing away from the sun, i.e. spin-\nning away from the sun, hence they are correct.\n\nThe answer to this question is \"B\".\n\n### Input Why is it dangerous to play in road?

{"text": "Input: Where can I find a steakhous with a view of cornfields? The correct choice is E: utah.\nExplanation: \n1. 'Ne' is a prefix meaning 'not', so we can immediately eliminate A: Nebraska. The word 'n'e'raska' means 'not Nebraska'.\n2. Option 'B: New York ', the second choice refers to 'a town in New York'. The sentence requires an answer that indicates a direction, not a city name.\n3. Option C: Mexico is used to refer to a country. So, it does not fit the criterion of a direction of a steakhouse.\n4. Option 'D: home ', while referring to a 'place to rest', it does not convey a direction.\n5. Option 'E: Utah ', is a US state, and also can mean a place to rest.\n6.

It is not in the correct word order.\n3. Choice B: a lot catching up, can't be either. It doesn't match the structure required.\n4. Choice C: a lot to catching up, is also wrong. It doesn't maintain the correct word order. 'to' isn't used in the correct place..\n5. Choice D: a lot to catch, isn't the chosen structure. To match the grammatical structure of the sentence, 'to' should be used after 'catch'. The word is 'to catch', not 'catch'.\n6.

Similarly, \u201cpiece of table\u201d is a noun phrase, and we're not looking for a noun phrase. 3. Because \u201cmade the table\u201d refers to the entire table, the second option, \u201cthe table,\u201d fits perfectly. 4. \"some things\" refers to items in a table, and \"some things\" here refer to some pieces of table, it can't be answer. 5. \"some things\u201d doesn't refer to the table itself, so it doesn't indicate that we made the entire thing.

{"text": "A: Wilderness\n\n### Rationales: 1.\"Where\" initially tells us to think of a place that the subject of the sentence doesn\u2019t go.\n2. Although a Marmoset is a land mammal and could potentially live in a wilderness, the word choices used give us the impression that this is a place that the speaker of the sentence would not choose to go as well.\n3. So option D: underground is incorrect as this could potentially be a place the Marmoset could live and also where the speaker could potentially choose to go.\n4. The other options seem to be very specific, yet not entirely incorrect as they could potentially be places that a Marmoset could live or that a human speaker could choose to go.\n5. However, for the purposes of the argument, it is enough for the choices to be places that the Marmoset could not live in or that the speaker does not choose to go to.\n6. And since the speaker of the sentence isn\u2019t a Marmoset, it makes more sense that they would choose to avoid those places where the Marmoset does not typically live or go.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: Colorado.\n8. The speaker may choose to visit the Colorado region, as it is a marvelous tourist destination, but it is not a good place for a Marmoset to live, or one that the Marmoset would typically go to.\n\n### Input : Where do you get most of your energy from?

The options which can\u2019t answer the given question are: Option A: building because the question asked about a side chair.\nOption E: bathtub, as the question asked about a bathtub, not a side chair.

{"text": "C:learn about, She had a knack for learn about, everybody told he she,She learnt about in class.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: She had a knack of what? Choices: A: learning English B: learn English C: learn about D learn English E: speak English\nRationales:\n1. The sentence begins with She and then it says She had a knack, which denotes possession. So She must be possessing a noun.\n2. The sentence then goes on to say for what.\n3. A knack can be defined as a natural ability in a person. It can also be referred to as an excellent talent.\n4. Therefore it should be a noun.\n5. The question is essentially asking for the noun possessed by the subject of the verb had. But the sentence is too short it only contains an auxiliary word, a subject, and a gerund (learn).\n6. Looking at the possible answers A: learning English B. learn English these do not form complete sentence.\n7. So eliminating these choices\n8. Finally we are left with Choice C: learn about.\n9. It is referring to how to use a verb that is a gerund. The word learn is a verb which is a gerund here.\n\n10. Therefore I will input C: learn about into the system.", "answer": "B: talent"}
{"text": "Dave put his beers into the cupboard, which he could then grab later.   \n\n### Question:\n> What did Dave do?\n    \n### Demontration:\n1. The sentence asks 'where did he put it?', so we can only put a location, not a noun like beer or can.\n2. The choices available are\n   1.'refrigerator' : we don't have more than one of these. However, a refrigerator can contain food or drink.\n   2. 'can' : a can of beer is a beverage. we can't just randomly use it anywhere.\n   3.'shelf' : we can use the word'shelf' for anything that is placed on it. but in this sentence, shelf was used to refer to where we can put something.\n   4.'soccer game' : in this context, it is a noun, and we don't know where the noun is so it cannot fit.\n3. 'Cupboard' : cupboard is a place where we can keep things, that is a place we can put something. so it is correct.\n   4.

{"text": "Several decades ago, when people's expectations in life were low, the atmosphere was clean. So that was the place that people could only find that. With the development and improvement of technology, more and more people begin to be conscious of protecting the environment. They have the feeling that \"the world is getting lonelier\". Many people begin to find the natural atmosphere pollution-free scenery is becoming more and more rare. Since then, more and more people start to buy air cleaners. They have tried to make use of every possible and possible ways to get cleaner air. They want to spend the rest of their lives in a comfortable and beautiful house surrounded by a clean and fresh air. As many houses in Beijing are newly designed and people buy a lot of cleaners, air could be found in many places: apartment, office, kindergarten, and even in a shopping mall. Therefore, we could find that the place people could find air that has been \"breathed by many people recently\" is \"all over the city\".\n\n### Rationales: \n1.  The sentence in the instruction asks us to describe a place where we could find air that has \"been breathed by many people\", but our options are 'house','space shuttle', 'air', 'air shuttle', and'surface of earth'. It is clear that these options do not describe the place.\n\n2.    In the instruction, it says that we should find a place where we could get air that has been \"beathed by many people recently\".  We should find a place that has been breathed. Since human breathing is a natural phenomenon, this refers to the atmosphere. Therefore, we can rule out option A: charming that does not refer to the atmosphere and option B: space shuttles that is a craft spacecraft, not referring to the atmosphere. \n\n3.   Therefore, we can rule the options C: house and D: train station because the question refers to the atmosphere that has been breathed recently and therefore the context that the air came from and the time that the air was breathed are the key factors.\n\n4.   The options E: surface of earth do not make sense. First, since the question mentions atmospheric air, the option E: surface o earth cannot make sense. Second, we can assume that the air here refers to the earth", "answer": "D: train station"}

{"text": "Rationales:\n1. \"to gain her trust the real-estate agent was very polite\" - The sentence is a passive one (e.g. in the passive voice \"The real-estate agent\" is the verb and \"was very polite\" is the object.\n2.

The first two options, B and C, do not fit the passive structure.\n4. Option A: \"manipulate\" may describe how the real-estate agents acted, but it is a transitive verb (e.g. \"Sally manipulates her husband with kind gestures\", \"Sally manipulatives her husband with kind gestuers).\n5. Option D: \"exaggerate\" is a word that refers to \"to speak with more energy or volume than is natural and intended\". It is a transitive verb not a passive verb.\n6. Only option E, \"incompetent\", is a passive verb phrase in the passive voice that is of a form \"to be\" (e.g. I am incompetent, I am getting incompetent, we were incompetent) that describes the agent's behaviour.\n7.

{"text": "The correct answer would be'space shuttle'.\n### Rationales:  When a question wants us to describe or list possible outcomes, then it usually specifies which elements are to be included in the list. For example: 'Where are the apples? They went to the following places.'\n1. From the sentence \"lot of windows\" we can see that the person is looking for a physical place that has lots of windows rather than lots of apps, which the first option A: wall clearly rules out.\n2. The second option C: space shuttles is a bit tricky, since it seems to be a correct answer because it has lots of panels that are known as windows in space shuttles.\n3. But the person probably means windows that are commonly found in houses.\n4. So, the person probably means that we see lots of windows when we go to space stations like the ISS where astronauts work and live.\n5. And so the correct answer would be 'Space Shuttle'.\n\n### Input : Where do they live? Choices: 1. A: aunt B: uncle C: mom D: dad E: grandpa\nRationales:\n1.

{"text": "A: airport\n\n### Rationale:1. A person would take a large netted bag to an airport, perhaps for putting their luggage into. \n2. So, there is no reason to choose the word that isn't related to an airport.\n3. A person would not normally pack their luggage or take a large nettined bag to their airport in this way. \n4. If you were to use your netted drawstring for the purpose of packing your belongings for the trip to your airport, that would be inappropriate. \n5. The first choice is C: jewelery store. \n6. In a jewelry store, you wear your jewelry and you go to take a small bag. You won't be carrying a large drawstring bag. \n7.

{"text": "C: stress\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple answer question.\n### Demonstraion:\nInput: A tire on the left side of the car blew up, now we can't use the left handlebar. Now we're going to have to... Choices:  A The tire went flat B The tire needs inflating C Change the wheel D There is a puncture\nRationales:\n1. The sentence is basically asking us what we have to do now that our left handlebar is out of use.\n2. The first, fourth, and fifth options provide no answers and should be eliminated.\n3. The fifth option, 'There is a puncture' doesn't provide a specific solution and so should be eliminated. \n4. The last option, D. There is a punctire states that the tire has a puncture. This is not what we're looking for so it should be eliminated. We already are aware that the tire has gone flat; the sentence is asking for the solution to the problem and the last option doesn't provide a solution. \n5. This makes the answer: C \u2013 Change the wheel\n\n### Instructon:Answer the following multiple choose question.\n###  Demonstration:The weather has been a lot cooler. I hate the heat, but I always look forward to summer Choices:  A  I love the heat B Winters can be so beautiful C I like going to the beach D I'm a warm weather guy E I love summer\n\n### Response A: I'm a warm-weather guy\n### Rationale: 1. \"Summer\" and \"summer\" are both names of seasons. 2. \"I'm a warm-water guy\" has something to do with summer because it begins with the same word, \"summer\". 3. \"I like summer\" describes someone who likes summer, thus showing that they like summer, which is a summer activity.\n\n### Response B: I love the heat\n### Rationale 1. \"Heat\" is a weather condition, and describes a season. 2. \"Winter\" and \"heat\" are weather conditions with a different season. \"I always look forward to summer\", indicates that \"I love the heat", "answer": "B: frustration"}
{"text": "The exercise that you do when you\u2019re tired, is to burn off the energy in your body.\n\n### Rationales: 1: The sentence states that you may get tired by exercising.\n2: We don't want to be fatigued, so choosing fatigue would not be ideal.\n3: That means option A: is incorrect.\n4: Also, even though the question states that you may be tired by exercising, you aren't specifically looking to relax (using the word \u201crelaxation\u201d). Instead, you're going to burn off the energy you accumulated, either through exercise or by eating food. So, we eliminate this option as well.\n\n5: Option C: is incorrect too, as being tired is not a consequence of exercising. It's an indication of being too tired to exercise.\n6: Also, this option does not answer the question.\n\n7: Next\n\n7: Next, we look at option D: muscle weakening. We eliminate this option, as muscle weakness is a consequence of not exercising. This option does not reflect a benefit of exercising.\n\n8: Finally, we look at E: the last option. While yes, losing weight is a possible benefit of exercising, it doesn't answer the main question of why? and more importantly, it can be easily mistaken for an incorrect answer based on what the question asks.\n\n8: Therefore, the answer to the question is E: losing weight.\n    \n8: Therefore, in conclusion, the correct answer to the sentence is \u201cto burn off that excess energy.\u201d.\n\n### Input1: Why can't we sleep while travelling in a car? Choices: 1: The engine noise \n2: Traffic pollution \n3: Air conditioning \n4: Bright lights \n5: Exhaust system\n\n### Response1: We cannot sleep in cars because the engine noise disrupts us and awakens us, preventing us from sleeping.\n\n###Rationales:\n1. The question asks, why we cannot sleep in a car.\n2. We cannot drive or operate the car if we are sleeping. Therefore, being unable to sleep while driving is why we cannot sleep in cars.\n3.

{"text": "The term, tore, indicates that the wind was spreading over the surface.\n\nRationale: 1. The first choice, dry hair, refers to a style of hair. A wind doesn\u2019t dry hair.\n2. The second choice, spreading, is a suitable choice, as it indicates that the wind was moving in a way that spread it over the surface.\n3. The third choice, blowing hard, means that the wind was moving fast and continuously. However, since the sentence says that the wind tore off something, the wind clearly wasn\u2019t blowing fast and continuously.\n4. The fourth choice, change of direction, indicates that the wind direction changed at some point. According to the context, this is incorrect because the sentence states the wind blew in a certain direction, which means that the direction didn\u2019t change.\n5. The last choice, wave wheat, also doesn\u2019t make sense. Waves are created by sea water that flows back and forth, so a wind can\u2019t be compared to waves of water.\n6. Therefore, the most suitable answer is B: spreading.", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}
{"text": "1. This is a multiple choice question, there are 5 options to choose from. Option A: pond is wrong!\n2. Option B: underwater is incorrect!\n3. Option C: aquarium is not what described by the question.\n4. Option D: lake superior is not the same as most winters.\n5. Option E: body of water is too vague as it could refer to lake, river or ocea for example.\n6. Hence, the only option that suit the question is option E: body of water.\n\n### Input:: The dog was very clever, he was barking a dog. Choices:  A : bark  B : a dog C : barking  D : dog\n\n### Response\n\n1. This question is asking what the dog was doing before it barked. This means it should describe the action of the verb.\n2. This is why option A: bark is not what we need.\n3. Next, We try option B: a dog which is not what we need, instead, it is the subject which is the dog.\n4. Moving to a different part of the question, we check option C: barking which contains the action of the verb bark and is what we need.\n5. Finally, We are still stuck in the part, so we look at option D: dog which contains the subject and it also describes what it was doing before it bared which is why it is what we need. Hence, the correct answer is option C: bark.\n\n### AIQ 02\nInput: \"How often do you exercise?\" Choices:  A Lucky few  B: not at all  C: Never  D: everyday  E every week \nF: a few times/month  G:  once in a while  H: some days\nRationales:1.

The first four options are all choices that describe the speaker\u2019s condition, but \u201cunder\u201d describes the current situation that he is not feeling well.\n2. Then, \u201cover\u201d means overweight, so it is not suitable.\n3. Similarly, \u201cout\u201d, another expression that means same as \u201cunder\u201d, cannot be suitable because it is the under situation that he is feeling poor.\n4. \u201cOn the floor\u201d does not help answer the question at all, because the speaker is not lying on the floor, as it has nothing to do with the current situation.\n5. Finally, \u201chigh\u201d means high temperature. The speaker in this sentence might be feeling a little sick so that he feels hot.

The question 'Where are the windows in a flight kept?' is asking about the physical location of the windows in the plane.\n2.  Option 1, 'outside', is incorrect because a plane is not an object that is outside.\n3.  Option 2, 'in space', is outside the scope of the question and doesn't answer the query.\n4.  Option 3, 'in the clouds', is not a suitable place for a window.\n5.  Option 4, 'near the doors', is also incorrect because the doors of a plane are not near the windows.\n6.

The first option, A, would be correct if one answered that they think of their mother as a child when they were children.\n2. In the same way, one would think of their mothers as childish whenever they behave childishly.\n3. The third option, C, would be correct if they would consider their mother to be childish in some other situation than when they or their mother are children.\n4. This question is about how one sees their mother, and only the first part of the sentence is relevant.\n5.

Furthermore, \"excellent\" does not have a close association with the rest of the sentence, and would be an unusual adjective to use here.\n4.

This answers the question.\n\n## Response: There are certain types of words that often appear together. If you notice there are recurring words that are repeated often, that means that we can find a phrase that matches the style of the sentence and the frequency of words.\n\n### For instance, if you think about what is the most general type of school, it is a school.

It begins with the word \"We,\" which indicates that a group, rather than an individual, chose to buy some new shoels and thus needs a plural verb. \"Had to\" is the verb in this case. \n\nIt is easy to determine that B, C and E are incorrect since they do not begin with \"We.\"\n\nSince A is the subject and it is singular, the correct answer is B.\n\n#### 2. \nC refers to an object which \"does not indicate a place.\"\n\nThe sentence is talking about an action taking place, as we can see from \"buy some new shoels.\" This action is taking place where?\n\nThe correct answer is A because the action is taking place in a location.\n\n#### 3. \nB stands for a place and the sentence wants to describe an action that could be referring to shoes, which are definitely objects, rather than a place.\n\nThe sentence says \"we had to\" which indicates an imperative mood to describe the action.\n\nThe sentence is not talking about a place because it does not start with \"we\", which indicates that a plural person is talking about a plural action.

Option B: 'conference' is not a suitable place as we do not stay in a conference.\n4. 'Building' is the name of a structure.

The first question asks how the speaker felt when she first heard the news.\n2. The answer 'dismayed' is the only choice that reflects these feelings.\n3. The following question asks how the speaker feels now as a result of the news.\n4. 'Dismayed' fits here, too, 5. The last question asks what the speaker can do in this situation.\n6. The only answer that reflects these feelings, 'dismayed', doesn't necessitate doing anything because the situation is out of the speaker's control.\n7.

The word \"there\" implies that the rest of the sentence describes the answer.\n3. So it is an adjective to describe \"there\".\n4. \"people\", the first option, could be describing a place, but not necessarily \"there.\"\n5. \"a place\" does not make sense here; this could be anything from a store to a car garage to a house.\n6.

The trees are in the forest by the stream. He is most familiar with beech trees because A: He has seen them before. B: He can see them from the kitchen window. C: They have a lot of yellow and brown leaves. D: They are a native tree.\nRationales:1. We use the word 'familiar' to describe how one 'knows' a thing, but only John 'knows' maple and beech.\n2. So to get right answer we need to find a word that describes knowing.\n3. The first thing John knows is \"maple and beech\". So that should be part of the answer. \"Knows\" indicates familiarity, that he was familiar with both trees. \n4. The next part of the question is \"they\".\n5. It's plural, not singular so the next noun needs to be plural as well.\n6. \"They have a lot of yellow, brown leaves\" is a complete noun phrase so it needs to be plural, so it's not beech.\n7. \"native tree\", doesn't make much sense either.\n8. Only the two options are left: \"He can see them from the window\" and \"They are a native tree.\"\n9. So, option D, \"native tree\" is an incorrect response.\n10. Since the only other choice left is option B, \"He can see them\"\n11. Hence, the answer to the question is B: He can see\n\n12. The sentence asks us how John knows maple and beech; but the sentence doesn't indicate whether he knows them by seeing, smelling, or touching.\n13. We can immediately rule option A: saw them before, out.\n14. Similarly, since maple and beech are not in his close proximity, option C \"can see them from the kitchen\", needs to be eliminated as well.\n15. The question doesn't provide any indication as to whether he knows them through smell/touch.\n16. Now let's discuss the 'window' part of the question.\n1", "answer": "D: math problem"}

E) you should stay inside.\n\n### Response:#8\n\n### Rationales: 1'Let's go in:' indicates a desire to spend some time inside.\n\n2'\"But there's no poitn': indicates a disagreement with the idea of going inside.\n\n3'Let's go': tells us a person wants to know what the second quote is implying.\n\n4Since the second quote doesn't say it's raining, we can rule out A: it is raining heavily and C: it is not a good time \n\n5to go out.\n\n6B: it is a nice day to \n\n7go out: is also ruled out since the quote does not actually say it is a nice day.\n\n8And E: you should goes out now for recreationalpurposes, is also ruled out since we do not know what the second quote implies.\n\n9Therefore, the answer is D: it is not a \n\n10good time to go out.\n\n1112.Answer: D: it is not 13 a good time to go 14out\n\n\n### Input:`Mary is from Wales", "answer": "C: solitude"}
{"text": "### Dem:\n\nIn the given question, through an eyep - piece what you see is known as \"Sights\", not \"Optical illusion\" option \"A\", \"Optical telescope\" option \"D\" or \"Binoculars\" option \"E\" as they are not related to what the question is asking.\n\nThe answer is 'B': sights.\n\n### Solution:\nThe input in the question is quite unambiguous. \n\nIt asks us what we see through an eyep-piece. \n\nThis question expects us to identify a word from the phrase in the question, \"through an eyep- piece\", that is used to refer to the object that we can see. \n\nClearly, there is only one option that has anything to do with this. \n\nIt is B: Sights. \n\nSights (verb form) means that we have seen something, and Sight (noun form) refers to the actual act of seeing something. \n\nBoth of the phrases have the same meaning for us. \n\nIn a nutshell, the answer is B : Sight.\n\n### Input : What is it called when the two wings of birds are kept together? Choices:  C: flight D: flying  E: flap\nRationales:\n1. Both sentences share the common verb form \"keep together\", which describes an action that the nouns are called 'wings'.\n2. Choice A: Flight and C: Flight may look similar because both of them have the same number of letters, but the first part is a different type of word than the second part.\n3. The first part is a verb, which has a \"y\" ending, while the second part is a noun that has an \"i\" ending.\n4. Hence, it seems obvious that these are not the same word.\n5. This means that we can ignore these options.\n6. Similarly, both options E: flap also have different suffixes; hence, we can ignore these too.\n7. Therefore our answer is D: flight.\nAnswer: D: Flight\n\n### Input:- A pair of legs to run. Choices: A- legs of animals, B- arms, C- feet, D- hips, E - arms", "answer": "A: sights"}

{"text": "Input: Getting somewhere: Choices: A: disorientation B. Due to C. Meeting new people D. Getting somewhere E.

The four choices are: disorientation, due to, meeting, and relocation.\n3. \"Due to\" is directly related to an action verb (\"getting\").

I think we can infer this because the sentence includes a comma before eating well.\nAlso, I think we can infer that eating healthy should be in the past tense because Alice\u2019s health has been poor.\n\nExercising everyday is also an activity or exercise that should be ongoing from the past and maybe Alice didn\u2019t want to do this anymore.\n\nAlso, I understand the sentence is asking what can Alice do to improve her healthiness while having a poor health at the moment.

It indicates relaxation, but does not specifically mention the behavior of animals, so it is not the best answer.\n3) The term 'keep alive', the third choice, is a gerund phrase that means to continue to live, so it would be appropriate as the answer to this question.\n4) The fourth option, 'need to eat', is a verb that means to require food or a certain amount of food. Although this could be true if an animal is tired, it is not necessarily the appropriate behavior to choose as the correct answer.\n5) The fifth choice, 'go to sleep', is a verb phrase that means to fall asleep or to doze off.

Although you might feel that you are being put in an awkward situation by this sentence, the best way to answer this question is to think of'man' as referring to both men and women. \n6. This is because the sentence itself can't be interpreted as saying that only men or only women can shower. \n7. So, the right answer to this question is B: shower. \n\n\n### Instructor/Sage:\nHere's a lesson in what one should not do. Answer: B - shower  \n\n\n### Demotivation:\nIn English, there are many words that are used to refer to women, or girls or men or boys and it is important to use the correct word for the correct gender. In this piece of writing, the noun'man' has been used and we should understand that this refers to men only. And though this should be common knowledge, some of us do not use the correct words and that makes it sound extremely awkward and rude - if you were to address a girl as'man' in class, you would be considered to be a bad teacher/lecturer.\nIf you do not know which gender a person belongs to, just refer to them with the pronoun 'they' or 'their'. These words are plural but are used in place of singular nouns.", "answer": "C: dress himself"}

{"text": "The correct option for your response is C: Cafe D: Home for the following reasons.\n\n#### I'm at a restaurant and want a glass of milk\n\nThe sentence is giving information about the subject, telling us that the subject is at a restaurant. Apart from that, the sentence is telling us the subject\u2019s desire to have a glass of milk for his meal but doesn\u2019t tell us the subject\u2019s intention or plan.\n\n#### How do I find out if They serve that?\n\nThe sentence is talking about the subject needing to inform how to find out whether they serve that (Milk). At this point, we still don\u2019t know which they are, we should look at the options. \n\n#### Choices: A: accompaniment to the meal, B: Waitress C: Cafeteria D: Home and E: Menu.\n\n#### A: Accompaniment to meal: -\n\nThe correct answer to this sentence \u201c I'm at a restaurants and want a glass of Milk\u201d would be \u201cI\u2019m Looking at a Waitress\u201d. The answer would not be Accompaniment to the meal.\n\nWe all know the Milk is used as an accompaniment in meal. But the subject is not looking to find out Milk is the accompaniment to meal.\n\n#### B: Waitress: -\n\nThe second choice, the correct answer would be \u201cI\u2019ve look at a Waitress\u201d. A waitress is not involved in the situation.\n\nOne of the reasons why a waitress would be the answer is because she would be more likely to know where the Milk is available.\n\nSince a cafeteria would be a good location where the Milk would be available in this sentence, a waitress would be working in the Cafeteria more often than the cafe.\n\nTherefore, the Waitress would be the last choice.\n\n#### C: Cafeterias: -\n\nCafeteria is the only choice in the options for this sentence as the first and second sentence clearly says that the subject is at the restaurant. \n\n#### D: Home: -\n\nThe third option \u201c Home\u201d Is more often known as the place for where a person lives. It would be more likely for the subject to have Milk at home than a restaurant.\n\n#### E:", "answer": "E: menu"}
{"text": "Answer: C: eye strain\n\n### Justify:C: eye strain. The sentence is asking for what might happen after driving a car. E: car crash implies that you have crashed into another car. This does not imply pain.\n\n### Response 2: Answer: B: backache. Since the car crash might not involve pain, the pain can be a result of driving the car.\n\n### Justification: B: backache: We find the best match for the scenario given by B. The sentence is asking about what might happen after driving and does not specify what might happen if there is a car crash so option E. cannot be chosen as it is irrelevant to the scenario being specified by the sentence.\n\n### Answer: 1.

Yes, and? B. No, and? C. Yes, and? D. No, and? E. Yes, and?\nRationales: a. The answer to the second part of the question is 'No', which is the second option given in the answer choices.\nThis means that the sentence should be rephrased as, \"In addition to the previous question, there is an important part of you that I need to consider: whether or not you can use your laptop as a monitor.\"\nb. The sentence implies that the additional or different part of the question is connected to the whole context of the question, which means it should not be a new question.\nc. Both 'Yes' and 'No' could also be used as the answer to the original question to which the first part of the question referred. But using 'Yes, and?' instead of 'Yes, or?' would make more sense, as 'Yes, and?' would imply that it is a new question.\nd. So, the most appropriate answer is E: 'Yes, and?'\nAnswer: E: 'Yes,and?'\n\n### 6.

C) No, it's not. D) No, you don\u2019t need to.

{"text": "You should read Chapter 3 of the book 'Television Programs'.\n\n### Rationale:\nBooks, like the first four options, do not have chapters on the back. It might seem obvious to you that the speaker is referring to books, but in order to answer correctly we must be sure of the kind of object spoken about.\nSo we must consider all the options, and eliminate the ones that don't make sense, and we only have one option (E) left.\n\nThe sentence asks us to examine different things, but what we are examining, we learn from the third person pronoun 'it'.\n\nThe first three options refer to things, but they are incorrect because, as mentioned above, none of them have chapters on the front.\n\nThe last option (E) is the one that makes sense to answer the question and also to explain why we examine these things as well as the chapters.\n\nBecause there are many things to examine, if we examine the chapters in some books, then we can see what things are. This makes sense.\n\nSo the only option that makes sense is E: see particular program.\n\n### Input:[Why is it that I have to be so quiet in the library?]Choices:  A: it's a place that's very quiet. \nB: because everyone's trying to study. \nC: you're being nosy. D: i want to hear myself read. E: i want my voice to echo.\n\n### Response\n[I'm sorry. I don't want to be quiet. I want to read my book and go on the internet all at the same time.]\n\n### Rationales:\nThe sentence 'Why is it that I' is a question that asks about what, why, or how something works, or what happens, and the meaning of 'it' is the reason why the speaker has to be quiet in a library.\nThe first option, [A: It\u2019s a place that\u2019s very quiet'], is the only answer that is suitable for the sentence.\n\nIt means that a library isn\u2019t loud because it\u2019s a place where people are usually quiet, but it\u2019s still the answer to the question.\n\n## Task\nInput:Do you like listening to the radio?

{"text": "The response must describe the behavior of the people at the party. A: dance B: get drunk C: meet people D: have fun E: having fun\n\n### Instructions:Write your response next.\n\n### Rationale:The first choice, 'party', is a noun, while the last choice, 'fun', is an adjective. Neither of these two options describes the behavior of the people. \nNext, we check option A: dance. Although dancing at a party can be part of fun, it does not entirely define what the people at the party do.\n\nFor the same reason, option B: get drunk is also not the correct answer.\n\nOption C: meet people is suitable, as interacting with other people, learning about new things, and having conversations is definitely a valid part of fun. \nFinally, after checking D: have fun and E: having fun, we can conclude that the last option is the most suitable answer.\n\nAnswer: E: having fun", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

{"text": "I believe it should be A: good health.\n\n### Rationale: 1. The question refers to a benefit of exercise, which is a good health.\n2. Answer D: rest can\u2019t be the answer because rest is when not doing anything. \n3. Answer E: fatigue can\u2019t be the correct answer, because the sentence is asking us about physical benefits of exercises. \n4. While it is possible that exercise can make our physical body fatigued, there must be some other benefits which answer D: rest clearly misses. \n5. So, the only remaining options are Choice A: good health, B: heart attacks, C: relaxation, \n6. And Choice C: relaxation.\n7. Since Choice A: good Health refers to a wide range of benefits, including heart attacks and relaxation, it is a better choice to Choice A: good healtch because the choice is more specifically directed to a benefit of the exercise. \n8.

Battlefields are usually where bullet projectiles are located because battles are fought on battlefields.\n\n# 3. Weapons are used to fight battles; they are not found on battlefields directly.\n\n# 4. Canon is not where the bullet projectiles are found, because cannons are weapons. So, the choice is not canon.\n\n# 5. In the sentence, museum refers to a place where items are stored and displayed.\n\n# 6. Although there can be museums in battlefields, they are not where projectiles are stored. Hence, the answer cannot be museum.\n\n# 7.

The sentence is quite lengthy and requires you to understand what the sentence wants us to say, you need to work with the sentences to identify what the writer is telling us.\n\n2. The subject of the sentence is the action done to the \"murderer\", so in other words the person is caught.\n\n3. This then tells us that the following clause is the consequence of that action.\n\n4. Therefore, we want to find the word which could reasonably be understood as \"consequence\".\n\n5. We can then use that word (e.g. feeling of guilt) as the part of speech required in the blank.\n\n6. As option A: jail time involves imprisonment, we can eliminate this.\n\n7. As option B: fear involves the word \"afraid\", we can also eliminate it as being the correct part of speech required.\n\n8. So, the answer must be C: going to prison.\n\nAnswer: C: going to prison", "answer": "E: feeling of guilt"}

{"text": "> D: shed\n\n### Rationales:\n1. 'Where' indicates that we need the location of the toothpicks.\n2. The first choice (A: mouth) is obviously wrong because it doesn't reflect the location of tooth picks at all.\n3. The next 2 options (B: grocery store and C: constructing models) are both wrong, because although they are all about making/ buying/ selling or storing things, they do not give us the location/ place where the things are kept and/ or where they can be found/ obtained e.g. constructing models are built in a constructing model workshop.\n4. The last choice (E: box) does not give a location at all.\n5. Therefore, the only possible answer that provides a location of farmers' toothpicks is D: shed.\nInput: Why do we put candles in the windows? Choices:  S: to let others know you are open A: for lighting in the dark B: To get a job C: Because we are happy to see candles\n\nAnswer: S: to let others, others know you are open, are open\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Candles are not used to indicate that the house is occupied or that there is a presence in the house. However, candles ARE used to indicate that certain events, businesses or establishments are available for use or to provide light. As we read from the options, it is more than obvious that B, C or D is an answer which must be chosen.\n2. 'Why' signals that more than one reason must be given.\n3. C and D do not answer the question adequately, as it only provides one reason.\n\n4. A is not true. It is true for some old and antique houses, however in most houses, they are not used for lighting.\n5. B is not true. It doesn't indicate we are happy to see them, but indicates we don't have lights available for our windows.\n6. The only answer that satisfactorily answers the question is S: to let others (know you are open).\n\nAnswer: \n```python\ndef solution(s,t):\n    for x in range(len(s)):\n        if x == len(s)+1:", "answer": "A: mouth"}
{"text": "I think you should put it on a shelf.\n\n#### Rationals:\nThe verb 'put' requires that there is a place for something to be put, and the verb 'use' requires that the dictionary is used while it is there. Therefore, a dictionary must be put somewhere while it is being used.\n1. The noun classroom is used to refer to a place that is associated with the process of study, teaching, and learning. While a student is using a dictionary, the dictionary will most likely be placed on their desk.\n2. When you are using a tool at a desk, it is placed on the desk, not on any other surface. Therefore, option A: library will not do.\n3. Option B: Study area will have to be removed as well because a dictionary will not be placed on a study area.\n4. Option D: classroom cannot be used either because 'dictionary' is a countable noun and referring to it without a determiner is ungrammatical.\n\n5. The last 2 options: study area and shelf are grammatically correct. We know from the verb 'put' that it is not ungrammatical to refer to a dictionary without a determiner like the: a, an, or the.

{"text": "They would have fun and do \"enjoyable\" things tonight.\nRationales:1. The entire phrase was yelled out by the rowdy frat boys, which implies that they would have fun \"and\" do something enjoyable.\n2. If the group was planning on \"getting laid\" things, the phrase would not necessarily include an \"and\" in place of their current words.\n3. Next, the first \"enjoy\" option is incorrect because it describes an activity that is done for fun.\n4. Similarly, the second option, \"enjoyable,\" while not the best word choice, is the only one that captures the idea of having a good time.\n5. While \"work\" and \"less\" seem to work, the phrase was meant to indicate pleasure and enjoyment, not labor.\n6. Lastly, both fun and \"enjoying\" are meant for describing things that don't require too much work.\n7. Therefore the only choice that matches these descriptions is Enjoyable.\n\\(CORRECT\\)\n\n### Input:\"The children are having what types of activity today in class?\" Choices:  A. Fun, enjoyable, boring B. Work C. Learning D. Boring, Fun, Enjoyable E.

{"text": "In this situation, the sentence refers to the TV show. However, it does not specifically refer to the TV show itself, but the shows that the TV station broadcasts or airs on TV. Therefore, it is implied that this specific TV show (about ranger) did not air on TV the next day; instead, there was a different TV show (about gardener) which did air on TV.\n\n1. Because \"TV show,\" which is used in the sentence, refers to the shows aired on TV, we can rule out options B: anthology and options D: state parks, which refer to different TV shows altogether.\n2. In order to answer the question we need to figure out what type of shows are normally aired on TV. \n3.

However, we can rule out option A: countrydise because the TV station airs only shows, and not the country itself. \n5. We can also rule out option C: dumb read, because television isn't just about reading, as a whole, but also includes various other activities such as watching movies and listening to music concerts.\n6.

{"text": "Answer: C: candle\nDetailed Rationales: 1) When analyzing the options, it\u2019s helpful to look at the question and determine the parts that can be eliminated. In this sentence, we can easily eliminate the parts that indicate there is more than one light source. 2) We can also determine what the question isn\u2019t asking. In this case, we know it isn\u2019t asking for what type of light source it is, for it isn\u2019t likely to be \u201celectric\u201d after all. Furthermore, we know it isn't asking what kind of decorative source they may be using because this makes no sense at all.\n3) We can begin to answer the question that\u2019s actually asked by analyzing the parts that can\u2019t be ruled out. Given that we know there is only one light source being referred to, it must be a vintage or decorative light source. 4) We know this source doesn\u2019t have a \u201csun\u201d, it doesn\u2019t need one, because the source would be decorative or vintage. We know it isn\u2019t a \u201csky\u201d, it\u2019s not a light source, just the sky. 5) We know it\u2019s not a \u201ccandle\u201d because if this were a candle, they wouldn\u2019t want to \u201clight it\u201d, they would probably just \u201cburn it\". Furthermore, the words \u201cset in\u201d or \u201cdress up\u201d are more commonly associated with a candle as it relates to a candlestick. 6) We know it\u2019 s not a \u201chouse\u201d, it has nothing to do with lighting the house, it\u2019s an actual light, not a source to illuminate a house with. 7) The last option, \u201clamp\u201d, would make sense, as they would actually want to \u201clight\u201d it, which would mean the source is not decorative in the sense that they would want to dress it up. 8) We also know it wouldn\u2019t make sense to dress up a house, the source would have to be some sort of decorative or vintages lamp.\n9) In summary, the only logical answer to this question is C, \u201ccandle,\u201d which is also the most commonly accepted answer.", "answer": "C: candle"}

Looking at the options, we can eliminate A: fearless, because a \"fearless\" animal is one that doesn't fear anything, and the color yellow is used to describe bravery, which is the opposite of fear in most situations.\n3. It would look like we need to eliminate C: courageous, for the same reason. However, we can't fully eliminate the option, because it is also possible to have an animal that is \"fearless, yet brave.\" Therefore, it is possible that courageous is still a suitable answer.\n4. Looking at the next options, we can immediately eliminate B: English carrier, because \"English\" is an adjective, and the answer is looking for a noun, which would be the opposite of \"English carrier.\"\n5. So, we look at D: Brave, E: Achromatic, and realize that Achromatic is the best candidate for the correct answer, as it is an antonym for colorful. Additionally, the answer is looking for some characteristic of a \"color,\" which is an antonym of \"achromatic.\" \n6. Therefore, the answer choice is E: Achromatic. However, a bravery color is not actually \"achromatic,\" we also need to explain why this choice works by modifying the answer to read, \"achromatic bravery.\"", "answer": "A: fearless"}

Looking at the four choices, A: tear up is an option not suitable for answering the question. \n3. The sentence does not ask about the first tears that fall from the newborn's eyes when their eyes open. \n4. Next, the sentence does not ask what the first thing(s) a newborn sees at birth will be. \n5. Next, the sentence also doesn't speak about teary eyes getting glassy like they do when you cry. \n6. Choice B: see light is not a suitable choice either. \n7. The sentence does not say the newborn is happy at the time they open their eyes. \n8. So, choice C: fill with tears is irrelevant in determining the first thing the newborn will see. \n9. Choice D: be happy refers to a feeling or emotion and can't be something the newborn will see upon opening their eyes. \n10. It could also be that the newborn is not happy when they open their eyes for the first time. \n11. So, the only choice that correctly answers the question is A: tear up.\n12.

{"text": "The word'mundane' is very subjective, and often people use it interchangeably with words like'simple' or'regular'. However, it has an exact definition. Dictionary dot com provides the following definition:\n\nmundane \\\u02c8m\u0259n-\u02ccd\u0101n\\ adjective (\u02c8m\u0259n-\u02c8d\u0101n, -\u02c8don) formal : not very impressive, interesting, or strange\n\nThe word \u2018impressionable\u2019 refers to something impressive or something that creates a strong impression in someone\u2019s mind, therefore it cannot substitute for the word boring. The same applies to the concept \u2018arcane\u2019, that means that something can be hard to understand or difficult to figure out, but it\u2019s hardly interesting or intriguing. The word \u2018heavenly\u2019 is one that\u2019s almost synonymous with amazing, but it still doesn\u2019t really address the question of boring. One interesting aspect of the English language is that there are many words that are in the same context and which describe the same concept, but one has a slightly different word order and different emphasis on the main concept. Another example would be the word 'impresario' which describes an impressive person of authority, or someone in charge of impressive events or shows.\n'New', the last of the options provided, does in fact have an excellent definition. When this word is used in the context of boring it describes something boring because it has just been introduced to you recently. An example will be used to better explain this scenario. Let's say that you are going through the dictionary in order to find an interesting or unusual word and you stumble upon the word 'banjaxed'. When you think that there are several words already in the dictionary that convey this meaning you realize that the word was introduced to you the previous week and it already became boring. As stated, 'new' does not have to mean recently acquired knowledge, it can mean recently introduced as well.\nRationales:1. The word mundane already has a definition that is unique, it is often intermingled with the word'regular' but that it is not one and the same thing. Mundane implies that something is boring, as the definition states, \"a person who has never traveled, been to a different country, eaten at a fancy restaurant is a kind of mundane person\". You could substitute the word for boring", "answer": "E: new"}

If David has been hurting for a long time, the next thing he needs is relaxation (Answered 'He hadn't gotten enough in a long time'). In order for him to feel relaxed, he must feel confident that he can rest without hurting himself. However, he may have been hurting himself by doing so (Answered 'and he was in pain').

{"text": "He told the murderer he _was pure evil_\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. The options begin with two answers which are the same as the question word \"pure\". Firstly, the sentence asks for something that can be found before or after the guilty verdict, so option A: after which refers to something that happens later. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n2. Next, the sentence refers to two things that can follow the guilty verdict. It states that one of these is the murderer, who is being judged after the guilty verdict. This eliminates the options C: bad and D: negative from the answer choices.\n3. Finally, the murderer is mentioned as the only person in the question word \"punishable\", which eliminates option E: evil from the answer choices. Therefore, the question word 'pure' refers to a word that refers to murderer as he is \"guilty\". Therefore the sentence is a question asking'murderer is who that is pure what'.\n4. However, since murder is a crime, the sentence is referring to the action of crime. That meaning is the answer C: bad. Therefore, the sentence is an answer of'murderer was bad'.\n5. Hence, the answer of the sentence is C: bad.\n\nInput: What's happening in this movie? Choices: 1. A: A love story 2. B: A crime film 3. C: A musical 4. D: A horror film 5.

Therefore, option A: A couple is incorrect because it is actually a very vague way of saying there was only two.\nOption B: At least six means there is at least 6 types of dinosaurs. How many is option B? 7. There is 7 Types of dinosaurs in option B, but there are 8 in option D. Therefore, option D can't be A. However, 8 might be a little bit too vague since some people would think you mean 80 types of dinosaurs, however, option D is the correct answer due to the fact the only number above and below is 9.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: nine.\nAnswer: D: nine\n\n### Input\nHow much do you weigh? Choices: 54kg A: 54kg B: 540kg C: 54 000kg D: 54 711 A \nRationales\nOption A: 54.0kg is not a whole number. This answer is incorrect because it is not a decimal. You can't have a decimal in a whole number.\nOption B: 54.711kg is not a whole integer as it is a fraction. Therefore, it is incorrect.\nOption C: 54000kg is incorrect because that is the same as the second number.\nOption D: The last four numbers are not accurate.\nOption D is also incorrect because there are not three letters in this answer.\nThe question is asking how much you weigh, not how much something weighs.\nThere is no 3 in option D.\nOption D doesn't say three letters. There is no A in the number and the number has three letters.\nTherefore option D is incorrect.", "answer": "C: despair"}

{"text": "C\n### Rationale:\n1. The sentence tells us that, where you stand in the line, it is cold, and so you need a coat.\n2. The choices consist of different places that require some kind of coats.\n3. Choice A: graph is not one of the places where the sentence takes us to.\n4. Choice B: bank at noontime is one of the places we go to in the sentence - a bank. We could wear a jacket/coat at this place.\n5. Likewise, Choice C: good book, though generally we associate coats with winter, is also one of the places we could go in the sentence.\n6: Choice D: post office is one of the places as well - we can go here to post a letter too.\n7. The last place in the sentence is a bus stop. So, we could not wear a coat there as it is generally a warm place, but at the other places mentioned in the sentence, we do use coats. Hence, D: post office cannot be the answer.\n8. Therefore it follows choice E: bus stop.\nAnswer: E. bus stop\n### Conclusion:\nTASK: \nFRAME : I am looking for a place to post my letter.\nSTRAWMAN : Burn hot\n\n### Input - I have lost my way.

{"text": "### Demostration:\n\nInput: What are you looking at the picture for? Choices:  What: A: for B: in C: to D: at E: from\nRationales: 'What are you looking at the' refers to the picture, and 'the picture' is a thing. We can choose a noun to describe this thing appropriately. \n1. 'For' is misplaced as 'at' or 'on' is required. Hence 'for' can be eliminated.\n2. The preposition 'in' suggests a container in which there are things. So we can pick a suitable noun to refer to the thing in this container.\n3. In the second choice, 'to' is correct.\n4. However, in the third option, 'at' is incorrect.\n5. Hence, the correct answer is B: in.\n\n### Input:'what are they doing at the party?

She wants a warm winter but not the snow. What\u2019s she going to wear on a cold day? Choices:\nA: Shorts B: Sweater D: Jeans C: Sweater E: Long sleeve T-shirt\n\n### Response\n\nRationales:Input:There are many different kinds of snow. Choices: \t\nA: cold water B: dirty water C: ice D: salt E: snow\nRationales:1. When the sentence begins with 'There are...', you know there is going to be a list.2. 'Many different kinds of snow' is too general - it doesn't necessarily require different types of snow. For example, the temperature or the consistency of the snow could be the same as always but it is still referred to as a 'kind' of snow. So,'many different kinds of snow', isn't the answer.\n3. Next, we have 'Cold water'. This is an incorrect answer because cold water is not made up of the individual snow particles. Rather, cold water refers to water which is at a much lower temperature than is usual for regular water - which of course, it's not 'cold'. \n4. The next choice option, 'Dirty water', is also incorrect. Although dirty water contains snow particles, it doesn't contain the type of snow that the question refers to.\n5. Option E:'snow' is correct but it isn't part of a list, so it can't be the answer.\n6.

Choices:  a: top b: bottom c: top and bottom d: first and last e: last and first f: most important g: most significant h: the last\nRationales :1. The question asks about the items on the list at the end, so the term 'last' is needed in our answer.\n2. The term 'last' usually tells us that something is at the end.\n\n- Looking at our options, we find that option A: top is not a 'last' item on the list, so it does not answer the question.\n- Option B: bottom is often used for a 'last' item as well. But, since list is never considered top or bottom, B: bottom is also not suitable as an answer.\n- Option C: top and bottom, however, is used to define the two ends of the list. Thus, our options now reduce to D: first and last (the two extremes) and E: last and first (the initial and ending points).\n- Next, we look at F: first and last (two extremes). Since this answer does not contain the term 'last', it doesn't meet the requirement.\n- Option G: most important and H : most significant also exclude the term 'last', and can't answer the question either, so these are disqualified as well.\n- So we are left with options E and D.\n- Let\u2019s consider E: last and first in further detail. This phrase refers to the initial and concluding points on a list.\n- Since a list is never considered the last or the first, E: last and first doesn\u2019t answer the question. Option E is disqualified.\n- This leaves D: first and last as the correct answer. There are really two items: first and last. First refers to the initial item on a list and last means the penultimate (next to last) item on a list. The last item is the last item on the list.\n\nAnswer: D: first and last\n\n### Instruct:Write a response that appropriately answers the following question.\nInput: I would like to see my doctor next.

The next two choices, \"they lose a lot of time\" and \"there aren't enough customers\" do not support the idea of a different location.\n4. Instead, they show that they should work on Sunday, as there can be a lot of work for them to do, so we cross out those choices.\n5. If an employee stopped cooking early on any day of the week, then that means that they were working in a restaurant that was open early enough to start cooking.

Buses commonly stop in town/city so it would make sense that (option A: town) would be the answer.\n\n### You get this answer by excluding (option B: city,) and (option C: country,) because (option B: city) is an unnecessary word, it is not common to use 'the' 'country' \n\n### 4. and (option C: toilet) just explains the toilet - no use when there is already just the 2 options to choose from.\n\n### Final Answer: A: town\n\n### Rewording the question\n\n**Example:**\n'Where will you probably go to if on a bus?'\n\n### Answer\n\nOption A: town\n\nOption B: city\n\nOption C: toilet\n\nOption D: country\n\n### Input \n\"What would you be most likely to expect to find in a box?\"\n\n### Demostration\nYou would be most likely to expect a candy or cookie.\n\n### Option A: fruit and vegetables\n\n### Option B: candy and", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

{"text": "1. The sentence asks us to provide a noun for'something that the friend said'.\n2. A 'feeble' bull is not the one his friend is referring to.\n3. A 'bullbleep' is also unrelated to the friend's statement, as a 'bullbleep is an exclamation, which is totally different from a statement.\n4. A 'cow' is likely to be something that his friend refers to as 'feeble', not that's 'bull', as the friend referred to the former as a 'feeble' one.\n5. 'Female' refers to a 'bull', instead, to it's opponent, the 'cattle'.\n6. 'Charging prey' could also fit, as to a bull is a prey.\n7. However, 'charging prey' is not necessarily a feeble animal because it depends on the situation.\n8. We can narrow our options by eliminating the 'cow' and 'prey' as unsuitable.\n9. Looking at 'bullbleep', its meaning has already been defined in the sentence.\n10. So, the sentence can be better summarized using the word 'bull' and 'feeble bull'.\n11. Hence, the only suitable answer in the question is 'feeble b'ull' as the statement is about a feeble bull.\n12. We can finally eliminate'male b'ull' and 'charging prey'.\n13.

At the caravan C. In the car, D. In the motel E. In the pool\n  Rationales: 1) We can immediately rule out A. At the beach. This is an incorrect answer because the family didn\u2019t actually holiday at the beach, but at the holiday park they spent their time in the caravan, in the car, or in the pool.\n2) We also rule out B. At the car-van. A holiday park is not the same thing as a caravan.\n3) We reject C. In the caravan. The whole family did not have a great time in the caravan.\n4) At this point the sentence contains the word 'holiday' twice. This shows us that a holiday park is a vacation destination with amenities that provide a fun experience for families.\n5) Therefore, the correct answer is E. In the pool.

In option A: D, we know that only prague could provide the information regarding the city.\n2. We need to determine the reason why prague is necessary in the paragraph.\n3.

Choices:  D: because he likes sports  E: because he needs a luxury vehicle F: because he needs transportation H: because he loves sports G: because he didn\u2019t have a car\nRationales : 1. Too much information. The sentence contains a lot of unnecessary details. \n2. We are only told that John chose the new car, but we don't know why. So, the choices don't need to relate to this information. \n3. We can immediately eliminate H: because he lovensports because it\u2019s not clear why John chose it and it doesn\u2019t have any direct connection to why or why not. \n4. We can also eliminate C: because he needs a LUSHIO. The last word, LUSHIO is not correct, it's missing an H. \n5. Finally, we can eliminate F: because he needs a transportation because although it's true that a car can be used as transportation, transportation is not the why it's chosen. \n6. Next, looking at E: because he needs transportion. Although there might be a logical connection between choosing a car and needing transportation, the information provided is not clear enough to support this hypothesis. We don't know if John needs a car because he needs transportation. It's also possible that he needs transportation because he doesn't have a car. \n7. Eliminating G: because he didn't have a car seems reasonable, but it's a very tenuous connection. If John didn't have a previous car, why did he need this new one. It doesn't seem to make logical sense. 8. Moving on to D: because he likensports, this choice is supported by the fact that cars can be used as transport of sports equipment and they can be used for sports purposes, but we don' sneed it", "answer": "B: going to jail"}
{"text": "We should cross the street\n\n### Justification: \nThe sentence demands the use of a suitable verb, which must be able to reflect the action of helping himself. Since the person is wounded, it's natural to think that in order to help himself he should seek medical care. Hence, the answer has to be either D: doctor himself or E: cross street. However, medical treatment can't be received by the person while he's injured. Rather, it's reasonable to help the person crossing the street to seek proper medical treatment. Hence, I choose E: cross street because although a doctor might help the person, the action of this verb better reflects the action of helping oneself. \nAnother thing that needs to be kept in mind when answering such questions is that it must be the person's action to help himself. That's why in this case I rule out both B: visit relatives and C: chasing himself. Since relatives won't be able to help the person crossing a street, it doesn't make sense for them to visit each other, but rather it just implies the action of one party. Since D: doctor himself is about helping oneself, it can't be used, which leaves us with E: cross street as the only other option.\n\n### Other Instructions: \nWrite a response that appropriately parses the request.\nWriting multiple choice questions\nWriting multiple response questions\n\n### Additional Instructions:", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

None of the choices mention the chicken's desire to get to the other side.\n5. The first, \"Chicken crossed the road because it was on the other side\". This is probably not the answer as the chicken cannot already know where he was. Rather, this could be said of the chicken when it reached the other side.\n6. The second, 'To get cross the road\". This does not indicate the chicken's purpose in crossing the road, rather it indicates the result of the crossing.\n7. So the third choice, 'to get to the other side\u201d gives a suitable answer and the fourth choice 'cage\" cannot be the answer, as this choice doesn't involve crossing the road and only serves to separate the chickens.\n8. In the fifth choice \"chicken wanted to be on other side\" the chicken doesn't even cross the street. It only wants to be on the other.\n9. So the answer can't be that.\n10. In summary, only two of the choices, \"to get over\" and \"to get to\" give an appropriate answer to the question.\n11. But \"to get to\" is the more complete and specific answer, as it clearly indicates the intention of the chicken to reach the other side.\n12. Therefore, the answer must be B: To get to the opposite side.\nAnswer: B : To get to the opposite", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}
{"text": "The question is asking how to better describe the size of the crowd that was at the parade. The options that we will use to determine whether or not an answer makes sense will be small and big. We will know that we have the right answer if it is both small and big. Solitary, small, large aren't the only answers we can choose, however.\n\n\n* The first possible answer is \"it can better be described as field.\" This doesn't really make sense because if the crowd was big it would be hard to describe it as \"field.\" \"Solitary\" is the answer we can chose to add to our other answer.\n\n* One the other hand, \"a small group\" probably isn't how we would describe the crowd either. We have to look at our other responses. \"Small\" is also a thing, therefore it is logical that we will have to check our last possible answer. This is \"solitary\". \"Small\" makes sense with solitary, so we will have our answer.\n\n* Option C: small group. This option doesn't really make any sense. It might be easy to describe the crowd with this line as a small group but the sentence wouldn't make any sense if they were small. \"Small\" can't really coexist with what the question wants.\n\n* Option D: solitude. This option might make sense if the crowd was big, but it wouldn't make sense if they were small either. This option doesn'\n\n* Option E: solitary. Solitary doesn't mean the same meaning as solitary. They say \"alone\" or \"alone with\". \"Solitary\" means \"solitarily\" not \"solitarily.\" Therefore it is false.\n\n* This brings us to our final answer: it can better be described as \"small and big.\" Since you had to look at the sentence multiple times because you might not have caught this the first time, I did put it in bold for you in the answer. \n\nThe reason there were two types of adjectives in the previous instructions is that the question asked for ways to better describe the crowd. Because the crowd was both big and small, the only answer choice that really applies to the crowd is \"both small and big\".\n\n\n### Input : The police officer was quite rude to me.

Choices: A: to wash teeth B: to repair teeth C: to brush teeth D: to remove teeth E: to check teeth\nRationales:\nThe correct answer is C: to brush Teeth\n1. The question is describing a role of the dentist, not a responsibility\n2. To Wash/Clean or Repair Teeth is not a role\n3. To remove is not a role either as it is not what dentists do as per the description\n4. The last sentence says a dentist must take care of the teeth of the patient. The word care is the key word, so the correct answer is to brush.\n\n\n### Input :\nWhen a man sows, he reaps.

In the past this was an advantage to rugs makers and a restriction to those who wanted to buy a rug, because if you bought a rug with a pattern on it, you would have to look for that same rug again whenever the pattern is worn out which could take many years to wear out. Today, most rugs are plain, which saves money, and is a benefit to those who don\u2019t like patterns but have to have rugs. Choices:  A : Today, most rugs have patterns on them. B : Today, all rugs have a pattern on them. C : Today, most rugg makers only have patterns on the rugs they make. D : Before today, rugs were not plain because it cost too much money to make plain rugs. E : Today, rugs could have as many decorations as you wish so long as both the design and the colour suit your room.\nRationales: (1)The information in this sentence states that in the past, all rug should have a pattern in them, not that today all rug should have a pattern. This is not true. (2)This sentence doesn\u2019t mention what happens today, so we can\u2019t assume that it happened yesterday as well which is what the sentence states. Therefore, A is the answer.\nAnswer: A: Today, most rugs do not have a pattern on them\n\n### Input;\n(If you go shopping for the right outfit. You can only buy a dress or a blouse, not both.

Doing his homework refers to helping his father doing his homework. Doing his chore refers to helping his mother doing her chores Catching frogs refers to collecting frogs.\n\n#### Rationale: The task asks us about the tense of the sentence. The question mark suggests that it has tense and it is a mixed tense. So, it would be either a present tense or a past tense. The last sentence suggests that the child helps in completing his chores and that has been done since he was a smart one. And since the sentence says that he could be seen doing the task since he has been a smart one. Hence, the answer has to be past tense and thus present perfect progressive past participle should be used (has helped).\n\nAnswer: D. doing his homework\n\n### Task:You have 15 minutes to prepare a speech.

Buying beer might have become a habit for some person.\n2. Some people prefer beer to other alcoholic drinks and vice versa.\n3. Some people might think that beer has fewer negative consequences than other alcoholic drink.\n\nInput: Though there might be some other reasons also, we can rule out the options B: problems and D: intoxication by our own analysis. The reason being that a person won't buy beer in the midst of a problem.\nRationales \n\n1. Similarly, getting intoxicated only increases the probabilities of having a problem. Thus, it makes no sense to buy beer while having a problem or to buy beer to get intoxicated.\n2. Therefore, we can eliminate the options problem and intoxication.\n\nInput: So, the best choice would be A: to get arrested\nRationales\n1. It is unlikely that you would buy beer to get arrested.\n2. Though it would help solve your 'problem' as it will get you out of your problematic situation, you might only have one problem but there can be many situations you are stuck in.\n3. Furthermore, you're not even supposed to take this extreme action, as you still have a few more problems left to solve.\n4. Therefore, buying beer is not going to solve your 'problem'\n5.

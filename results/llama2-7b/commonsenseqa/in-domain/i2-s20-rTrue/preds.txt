Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:To locate a choker not located in a jewelry box or boutique where would you go?

Below are all the questions that can possibly be asked about an idiom like this. There are no right or correct answers to any of the questions - they are instead open to interpretation. Your job is to use the idiom and your creativity to compose a sentence or short passage that answers all of the questions. Each question is worth one point, and there are nine questions. Note that some questions must answer certain prompts but have the freedom to add anything else they wish, and some require answers to only the prompts listed.<n><n>### Prompt 1: The idiom comes from a passage where it is used incorrectly.

Choices: A: friend B: idol C: mentor person D: role model E: idiom (This is an example of an idiom used incorrectly.)<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. A: friend has nothing to do with the intended meaning of the sentence and is, therefore, not suitable.<n>2. B: idol doesn't work because you worship idols, but you must guide your teacher.<n>3. C: mentor person does not fit because my teacher is my teacher, not a person.<n>4. D: role model does not fit because the sentence talks about a teacher, not a role model.<n>5. The correct and only choice is E: idiom.<n><n>### Answer: E: idiom <n><n>### Demotive:  What do you think when you hear that someone is 'taking an axe to their problem'? Choices: <n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The only sensible choice is B: to try to solve a problem.<n>2.

It can’t be a kitchen, since it’s not like he can pull out some delicacies he cooked himself. He would only get that type of food at a restaurant.<n><n>Both the dining room and the sitting room are very big, which doesn’t fit the answer in this case.

Choices:  A: chicago B: street C: little italy D: food court E: capital cities<n><n>### Response:		<n>Where I would most likely expect to find a pizza parlor is in the food court. <n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Capital cities and Little Italy being two unrelated words, I can immediately eliminate the possibility for those being the answer. <n><n>We now then go on to eliminate B: Street; as that is a place where a restaurant may be, there is not any place that I could specifically expect to find pizza, and furthermore, as the original question asks me to expect, "Where" is definitely not something to expect in a pizza parlor. <n><n>Now that we have eliminated these, we can focus on the more important details of choices, little Italy and Food Court.  <n><n>2. Food Court I assume will generally be a place where food stalls are, and as a result, while there aren't necessarily pizza stalls in restaurants, the whole purpose of the food court is to supply food, and we can also assume that there will be some pizza shop there.<n><n>4. Similarly, the whole purpose of Little Italy is to supply all the things that Italians need and want; as a result, with the original question, it becomes very clear why it is a location where a pizza parlor could be. <n><n>5. As pizzerias are often found in very well known, commonly know places, you would expect to find a pizzaria in these places, which means that it would be very unusual to expect an Italian restaurant in a capital city, therefore, that is the answer.

Option A: 'broadcast' is the only one missing, as the other 4 options only concern with radio, and not what we can do with it.<n>2. A broadcast could potentially be recorded or transmitted (the 'what' of the sentence).<n>3. The word'recording' in A and 'transmitting' in D do not fit the structure of the question, as they are verbs (not what's done to a radio).<n>4. So "The radio is X for B (broadcast)" doesn't fit, leaving us with A: broadcast.<n>5. Option B: 'transmission' is incorrect because it doesn't relate to a radio at all.<n>6.

Choices:  A: walk B: lay down C: working D: moving E: exercise<n><n>### Response:		The sentence is asking us about the thing that the man’s body appreciated. We need to choose the thing that his body appreciated.<n><n>### Rationales<n>1. When we look at option A: walk, it is not what his body appreciated. Option B: lay down, if the body was “constantly lying down” it needs to have appreciated the rest, however, he had been constantly walking. Option C: working, it is not constant. Option D: moving, his body was working the entire day, and thus it cannot be the thing his body appreciated the most. Option E: exercise, if it was the thing his body appreciated it would have remained constant throughout, and it would have been mentioned “exercising” as opposed to exercising in the morning and the evening.<n><n>### Conclusion: The only option that can be answered is E.<n><n>Answer: E. exercise

Choices:  A. a group B. a party C. a team D. a business E. a committee<n>Rationales:1. The sentence initially asks for a suitable nounthe grammatical rules which have the noun or the pronoun as the subject of the verb, then the noun is placed after the conjugated verb.<n>2. Option C cannot be the answer because a business is an entity, whereas we are looking for nouns with the meaning of a team.<n>3. The fourth option. "A committee", is a collective that comprises members called members of a committee, as well as the president and vice-president or chairman of the committee etc.<n>4. Hence, the answer must be: A: a group<n>5. The answer option, "A group", is an entity like a committee that is formed to perform particular functions and activities.<n>6. Hence, the answer options are: A: a group and the answer is "A: a group".<n>7. Therefore, we can deduce that "a group" is the correct answer.<n>8.

Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Who was the head of the branch yelling at? Choices:  A: owner B: foot C: subordinate D: base E: point<n><n>### Response:		<n>>A: owner<n><n>Output:<n><n>### Explanation:<n>`Rationales:`<n>1. The word 'Yelling' means, angry person<n>2. 'Who was the angry person yelling at?' -> 'Who was it angry at?' -> 'Who did it angry at?'.<n>3. That's mean head of branch is angry at `owner`, not 'foot'.<n>4. `foot` is not an example of head of branch.<n>5. `owner` is an example of head of the branch.<n><n>### Input : Which one was broken? Choices:  a: glass b: window c: door d: table e: chair<n><n>### Respons:<n>>c: door<n><n>Output: The door was broken.<n><n>### Excplaination:The first option, 'a': glass, refers to a piece of glass used for windows, which isn't broken. The second option, ith: window, doesn't fit the use of 'was' in the sentence. 'it' is a pronoun and the sentence doesn't require it.<n>The third option, 'c': door, refers to the frame of a door or a panel in the door, which is usually wooden. 'd': table is incorrect because a table doesn't usually have a wooden frame. The fourth option, 'e': chair, refers to a chair with wooden frames, but could also include chairs with other frames if the frame was referred to rather than the chair itself. Thus, the only suitable option is 'c': door.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6.

Choices:  A: tennis racket B: skill C: competition D: tennis court E: legs<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:<n>1.  Tennis means “to play” or “playing” tennis. It's not an answer, it’s something people or things need to be good at playing.<n>2.  "What" means that we’re asking about something that must be there.<n>3.  The question needs an answer that is a noun phrase.<n>4.  The question requires an answer that is something required to be good at tennis/playing tennis.<n>5.  "What" and "to be good at" are already there.<n>6.  We then look for what is required to be good/play tennis.<n>7.  The answer should be something that must be there to be good at tennis, e.g., skill, knowledge, ability, physical features, condition, ability … etc.<n>8.  We can discard option A: tennis racket. A racket is used in tennis. However, it doesn’t answer the question. We need something that is required to be good or play tennis. <n>9.   Option B: skill is the correct answer to this question. It is required to be good in tennis, as it is one of the major contributing factors in performance. <n>10. The rationale for B is given above.<n>11. We can eliminate option C: competition. Competing in a tennis competition is not enough.<n>12. Option D: tennis court should not be there and can be eliminated.<n>13. Option E: legs should not be there and should be eliminated.<n><n>Rules:<n>1.  One should not use “and” or “or” before a singular noun. For example, if you say he is tall or tall, but it is incorrect. He is tall or not tall? It should be, “he is tall” or “he is not tall”. It is not correct to say “He is tall and not tall”.<n>2.  You can use “and” or“or” after a plural noun. <n>  <n>### Input:  The man was tall or tall. Choices:  A tall man. B tall men. C long men. D short men.

Choices: A: death B:coma C: peace D :Forgetfullness E:loss of life Rationales: 1 A: death B:Coma C:peace D:Forgetfullness E :Loss of life.A : death. James is scared of death. Death is the worst fear of any human being.  B:coma C : Peace. It gives out vibes of calmness in the mind and so james is scared of it. D:Forgetfulliness.It makes the mind not to think clearly. James is scared he will not be in peace  E Loss of life This is the main fear of any human being, not living and being alive.  Conclusion: James was scared of his last breath. He wanted to stay alive and he hated the idea that he will be dead any time now<n><n>### Rating & Discussion:<n><n>1. You understand the question well but your structure is a little awkward. For example, you could say "...James was  frightened. He didn't want  this. He was  scared of losing his life." I think you could still include death in the options: death, coma, peace, forgetfulness, loss of life. In the next prompt, you will have the opportunity to expand on your knowledge of comma usage.

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:If you aren't glad, unhappy or gloomy, what illness may you have? Choices:  A: depressed B: downcast C: angry D: unhappy E: sorrowful<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Demonstartion:<n>Rationales:1. The sentence states that if someone isn't feeling happy or unhappy, they may be ill.<n>2. We can eliminate the first 4 options, as they don't imply sadness or unhappiness. <n>3. We can also eliminate option D,as it doesn't match the sentiment of the sentence. Also option C isn't defined as sadness.<n>4. Therefore, the only remaining options are A: depressed and B: downcast <n>5. So, the answer is B.'Downcast'- a feeling of great sadness or unhappines.<n>Answer: B:'Downcast'- a feeling o great sadness or unhappy.<n><n>### Input:'You may be a doctor,' he said to his wife, 'but I'm your husband' Choices: A: your husband B: your spouse C:your husband D: your mate E:Your family<n>Rationales:<n>1. 'He said' is the first verb in the sentence indicating that the sentence is narrative in nature. <n>2. "You may be a doctor" - 'You' may have an action here so use pronouns to fit in and "His wife" is being used here as the pronoun. <n>3. "But I'm your husband" -'my' is being used to fit in here as pronoun because "I'm" is an action and 'husband' is the subject of the sentence. <n>4. "Your doctor" would not be grammatically correct. <n>5. 'Your spouse' - 'Spouse' describes a couple married to each other, which does not fulfil the requirements of the sentence. 6. 'Your husband'- He can call his wife as "You're my beautiful wife".<n>7. 'Your mate' -'Your mate' can not be used because'you are my wife' doesn't fit here. <n>8. "Your family" cannot be used because "You're my ( beautiful/ darling) wife". <n>9. The only option that provides you with complete understanding of the sentence is A: your husband. <n>10. Rationalise and conclude that option A: your husband is the correct answer choice.<n>Answer: A: your husband<n><n>### Input:"A woman came to our office

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

Choices:  A: united states B: sky C: court D: field of flowers E: orchard<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Explain your choice.<n>Bees tend to collect pollen in the middle of flowers and fruits. The sentence is asking where you could find a bee collecting pollen so your answer should be the place of pollen collection or gathering which is in the middle of a flower.<n>The orchard is an example of a place with lots of flowers and fruits for bees.<n>I decided for Orchard since it was more accurate. <n><n>### Explain others' choices.<n>### A. Burn hot <n>Burning hot suggests that it is an extremely high temperature. When you say hot in a place what we mean is there is a high temperature. <n>So the second option is D: court, the question was not where you would find a high temperature but where you will find a bee collect the pollen from a flower, so the second option is not accurate.<n>### B. Sky <n>Bees don’t collect pollen from the sky but from the plants so the option "sky" doesn’t fit the answer.<n>### C.Field of flowers <n>A field consists of many different flowers and the other type would be the orchard.The flower field doesn’t imply that it could be a place where bees would gather pollen. <n>### D. Gas station <n>A gas station does have fuel tanks but no flowers or anything for bees.<n>### E. Unite state or fruit orchard <n>We can not find unite state or fruit orchards in a classroom. Also, "Orchard" would work good because it has the flowers that the bees eat the pollen from.<n>### Choice D<n>The orchard has lots of flowers that bees would gather the pollen from so my answer would be the orchard because it has more flowers than the court.<n><n><n>### Input : What would you do with a shirt in your bag?

He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choices:  A: hosts B: hate C: nose D: hand E: fists<n><n>### Rationales:  <n>1. The sentence tells us that John is trying to do something with his fists, but he does not succeed.<n>2. He will have injured his hands, rather than his 'fists', which he used for punching.<n>2. The last option, "He will be unable to hold his fists", does not suit what the sentence is asking about.<n>2. The term 'hands' means the whole pair: left and right. So the sentence is asking us about what he will injure if he continues punching.<n>3. He will hurt both his left hand and right hand.<n>1. He will be unable to hold either his fist or hand, since he has injured them both.<n>1. Hence, the answer must be 'his hands'.<n>1. Therefore, the answer choice that most fit the sentence is E: hand<n><n>The second option that fit the sentence is C: nose.<n>The sentence uses the expression ‘hostile and ineffectual behavior’. However, it does not refer to the whole hostile and ineffectual behaviour itself. Instead, it refers to the fact that the whole behavior resulted in only blotches, and that John would not be able to continue the behavior.<n>Therefore, the sentence is asking about the ‘behavior’ that John would like to carry on.<n>The first choice, A: hostility fits the structure of the sentence and also answers the question asked<n>The first option, A: hostility. refers to the hostile behavior in which John is involved. It is therefore correct choice that describes hostile and ineffective behaviour.<n><n>The third choice, B: hate. although it refers to ‘John’s emotional reaction to the whole behavior of him injuring his knuckles’ (as it is defined in the book), but it does not answer the question. The question asks us to find the part of his behavior that he will not be able to continue. However, ‘hate is defined [by the book] as an emotion, not a behavior and therefore, it is inappropriate choice to answer the question.<n>The fourth choice, C: nose. however, does not answer the question either. This is because the nose is an organ, not a behavior, and therefore not the part

Choices:  A: buying B: purchase C: overpriced D: way to much E: expensive<n><n>### Response:		D: "way too much" because the word "was" refers to the past.<n><n>### Rationale:1. We use "was" to refer to the past. If you use "were" or "is", then the meaning of the sentence will change. This shows that the sentence asked for something in the past.<n>2. We can rule out choices A: "buying" and choice B: "purchase" because "was" refers to in the past and "buying" and "purchase" are actions that can be done now.<n>3. Options C: "overpriced" and D: "way to much" does not answer the question because "overpriced" means the price is too high, but "way to much" means the quantity of the item is too much.<n>4. Hence, the only choice that answers the question is B: "purchase".<n>5. Therefore, the answer will be B: "price too much".<n><n>### Input:"The sun will rise tomorrow." Answer: tomorrow because "will" means there is a future tense in the sentence.<n><n>### Response:"The sun will rise" is already a future tense. The next sentence will give another clue on what it will rise on so it will be Answer: the next day.<n><n>### Input."The sun was set tomorrow." Answer: the next day because "was" means past tense.<n><n>### "The sun was" already refers to the past.  So, it’s logical to use a past tense answer. The meaning of the sentence is a past tense event  and will happen again in the in the future. Hence, for clues given we answer it to be A: the next day.

"Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

Choices: 1. A: just for fun 2. A: win prizes 3. C: compete 4. D: don’t know why 5. E: compete for fun<n><n>Rationales:  1. The response "just for fun" could be given in the sentence if the first option was "running".<n><n>2. "Just for fun" is not a real answer to the question, but rather a suggestion for what to choose as an answer.<n><n>3. The first option is "running" which refers to a physical activity that has no goal but to burn extra calories and get fit.<n><n>4. Though the option "win prizes" is appropriate, it’s not the answer; it is a part of the answer, but the sentence asks us to choose all of the answer.<n><n>5. The term "compete for fun" should be used, because "playing sports without competition" doesn’t have a goal, meaning that "competing for fun" is a part of the sentence.<n><n>### Input (continued):If there is no competition to win prizes, which of the following is not an appropriate activity? Choices:  a. playing sports  b. win medals  c. have fun  d. get fat  e. play chess<n><n>### Response (Continued):<n>All of the activities that are given in the sentence are appropriate only if there is a competition. "Winning medals" or "winning prizes" is a goal of playing sports. Hence, they can be done, but they are only applicable when there is a competition. Therefore, a is valid, b is not valid, c is valid. <n>D is not valid and e is valid. Hence, the only option that is not suitable in the sentence when there is no competition is d.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A "The chef" B "a chef doesn't do" C "The chef doesn't like to do" D "Does a chef cook dinner" E "a chef is cooking"<n><n>### Rationale:<n>#### 1. The verb "do" is the auxiliary verb in the question. "do" when used wiith the subject, the subject is not included. <n>2. "What" is used to ask for information.<n>3. Therefore "What does the chef do when working in evening" is an interrogative sentence, and has the same word order.<n>4. "Do" is an auxiliary verb, and is the main verb.<n>5. Therefore "Do when working" contains the main verb, and indicates what is the work that we do when we are working.<n>6. "Chef" refers to someone who works in a restaurant or on a ship.<n>7. In fact the chef is working in the evening, so we use "Does that chef" to refer to the chef.<n>8. It means "What does the Chef does when working in the evening" is an interrobatory sentence, the subject is the chef. The answer the subject is the object in a sentence, so we are looking for "when working", which is the answer. <n>9. The subject is a cook, an auxiliary verb isn't required because we have the subject. What cook do when he is working becomes the verbal part.<n>10. Hence,  the answer is E" A chef is cooking".<n>Answer: E" A chef is Cooking"<n><n>## References

Building is incorrect as a building generally doesn't need a 'garage', and a garage isn't a building itself as much as it is an internal room within a building. Tool storage probably has a garage for tools used for car repairs, but this isn't a 'huge expense' and it isn't what is being referred to. Therefore, the answer choice has to be either A: bike or B: car.<n><n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where would you sit in a chair to watch four-legged animals complete?

Choices:  A: kitchen B: child's hand C: street D: toy store E: soccer game<n><n>### Response:		The best place to get a ball is one of two places. The first choice, 'kitchen', is an incorrect answer. A kitchen is a room where food is prepared, not a place where a ball can be obtained. The second choice, 'child's hand', is another incorrect answer. A child's hand is not a source of a ball. The correct answer choice, 'toy store', is a place where balls are typically sold, making it a legitimate option. The last choice,'soccer game', is incorrect as a 'ball' is not necessarily a soccer ball, which this question asked for.<n><n>### Input : What are the benefits of solar power?<n><n>### Rationales :<n>### Demonstraiton <n>Input: Solar power is great because _______ A: it is environmentally friendly B: it is easy to set up C: it is extremely helpful D: it can store power for many reasons E: it can be produced anywhere F: it takes a lot of power to heat water G: it can be very cost efficient<n><n>### Rationale <n>Rationale: C: it is extremely helpfull<n><n>### Ratioca:<n>Rationale 2:A: it is environmentally frendly<n>

Next we rule out option E: on one side of the plate, because the plates are flat.<n>5. The choice D: on one side of plate has an error in it. It should be 'on of side of a plate'. Choice D cannot be the correct choice.<n>6. The phrase 'on one side  of plate' is used correctly only when used as a prepositional phrase, so our answer is B: on one side of **plate**. <n>7.<n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

"Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What does a virus primarily do to a person?

Viruses primarily cause harm to bodies but they don't eat food. Hence, it can be eliminated<n>> 2. Answer B: reproduce. Viruses primarily spread by multiplying in different persons. Hence, it can also be eliminated.<n>> 3. Answer D: make computer malfunction. The viruses don't cause the computer malfunction.<n><n>- Rationale for B and D:<n>`Virus ` itself is an entity that can’t be used in the sentence.<n>`Virus makes computers malfunction.` <n>`Virus` itself doesn’t make computers malfunction. It is the `virii` that make computers malfunction, and as you can see the virii, singular, not the virus (plural) make computers malfunction.<n><n>`Viruses can replicate.`<n>`Virus makes computer malfunction.`<n>`Viruses replicate inside human beings`.<n><n>Here, what we can see here is that the correct answer is `B: infect` as this answer can answer the question correctly and can also be expanded to explain every single bit of the given information.<n><n>### Input :In the UK people wear a wristwatch on their _____ to tell the time.

Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What can happen to you when eating hamburger from someone that you do not know that does not happen when you usually eat a hamburger?

Choices:  A: undestroyable B: unbreakable C: indestructible D: durable E: invisible<n><n>### Response:		The movie has this fragile man (as described in the sentence) doing something he hopes to do.<n>### Instruction and Rationales<n>1. The phrase "his hope" implies that the man is doing something with the intention of achieving something.<n>2. This something relates to the question being answered.<n>3. So the man hoping to do something is a condition for answering the question being asked.<n>4. The question is asking what a person is hoping to be.<n>5. This is asking for a type of person who is a suitable candidate according to the movie description.<n><n>The sentence requires us to identify a suitable type of this man who has qualities the opposite of the man described.<n><n>6. The first type of person, 'undestroyable', is not suitable in this context, as it is not in line with the movie description.<n>7. The second type of person, 'unbreakable', is generally used to refer simply to people's physical toughness or resilience, and is not a suitable type.<n>8. The third type of person, 'indestructible', can be used to refer to objects or materials that are exceptionally tough and resistant to damage or destruction, but it doesn't necessarily refer to people and isn't suitable for the question.<n>9. The fourth type of person, 'durable', is used to refer simply to the ability of objects to resist damage, wear, or corrosion, and isn't suitable.<n>10. The fifth type of person, 'invisible', is not a suitable choice as it can refer to people who are not easily noticeable or who are hard to see in a crowd.<n>11. The only suitable type of person according to the question is 'durable', and 'indestructible' comes closest to being a plausible type. However, durable is more likely to be the intention of the sentence.<n>12. Therefore, the likely answer is D: durable.<n><n>### Demo Response:<n><n>A fragile man in the movie is hoping to find a person opposite him who is [durable]<n><n>### Instructions and Rationales<n><n>#### 1.

Because ‘money’ can be both a noun and a verb and the question does not specify whether it refers to a specific amount or general income, so initially we focus on a specific amount.<n>2. We cannot say 'fifteen cents' since that is a specific amount of money.<n>3. As much as we like the sound of using a 'one' as the answer, we cannot use 1, as that is not a noun.<n>4. We cannot say $100 as that isn't a noun or spelled correctly.<n>5. The answer is not 100 dollars because, although $100 is a large amount of money, it is not more than most salaries, so '$100' fits here.<n>6. There isn't any $1000 in the sentence so B is not an option.<n>7. We can't use 'one thousand' as that isn't spelled correctly.<n>8. The answer is 'one thousand dollars'.<n>Answer: One thousand dollars <n>### Input:"The car needs a lot of gas?" How long does it take to fill up?" Choices: <n><n>### Demostration <n>- The first sentence ask for a noun. <n>- The second one, question ask for question.<n>### Response <n><n>### Input:"How long does it take to install solar panels?"

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where would a ticket help you to get to a different country?

That is why I got one.<n>  As this is a free choice question, there is only one single correct answer. We can eliminate all the answers because they were not the answer mentioned.<n>  The answer is E: bus.<n><n>### Input 2:Where would you go by bus? Choices:  C: on the road E: off the road A: on the run<n>Rationales: C = on road, B = off road = the bus only goes on the road<n>Now, how would you get to a bus station?<n>Eliminate A: on the run as the only option from there is C: on the road.

Therefore, a "gleeful" party is a party with a lot of fun. So, "glee" can indicate "happiness" as fun is linked with happiness.<n>However, "glee" is usually used to talk about _emotion_ rather than _action_. Though we can describe glee as "happiness", we use the term "glee" to describe the emotion that we feel when we get/display happiness.<n><n>Rationales for "someone smoking" - Though we often use the term 'fun' to describe drinking and smoking, the verb fun doesn't actually use the term smoking. We use the verb "smoke" to describe the action of "smoking" which implies that the speaker does not want the answer to have anything to do with "smoking" even though it might be related to fun.<n><n>### Rationales for other options:<n>Option C- stress relief isn't an activity but a way to reduce anxiety which is unrelated to fun.<n><n>Option D- stress relief doesn't even relate to fun which is why it has been omitted.<n><n>Option E- "may laugh" only adds more confusion to the sentence. "laughter" is not a commonly used term to convey fun and there are more suitable terms - "jokes" "pranks" "sarcasm" "funny" - that are used to talk about fun.<n><n>## Demonstration: <n>#### Instruction:Complete the text with the correct preposition.<n><n>```<n>    ___ this year's meeting, _<n>    ___ all ___ will be expected to<n>    ___ our policies of  (1)____.<n>    ___ (2)______<n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

In this context, they are specifically not talking about ingesting food.<n><n>Choice C: go back to Work. <n>Rationals: Option C is a noun meaning an action going back to work. In this context, the words they or they'd is plural, therefore this word does not match.<n><n><n>Choice D: make food.<n><n>Rationals:  Option D is a verb meaning to prepare a meal, which does not make sense in this context, as that is contrary to the meaning of the sentence, in which they wanted to eat at home (rather than prepare a meal).<n><n>Choice E: get food<n>Rationals: The question asked which activity they needed to partake in as a consequence of not having any food in their fridge.

The sentence gives us two pieces of information:<n>3. That we are curious about something and that we cannot leave our house.<n>4. So, the best way to satisfy our curiosity despite us not being able to leave the house is to look at exhibits.<n>5. "Exhibits" are usually found in museums or other such places, and we can look at them remotely too.

The sentence asks why wait times are hard for working people.<n>8. The first option, A: having appointments, refers to booking a time to meet with the doctor.<n>9. This doesn't mean that appointments are inappropriate for working people. <n>10. The third option, C: have time to, doesn't have the "do" needed in the request.<n>11.

The last option, E: impatience, has the "do" in the request, but doesn't mean to wait.<n>13. It means to be easily annoyed.<n>14. Therefore, the only option that is fitting is B: being late.<n>15.

A shopping cart is a possible location to put a bag after someone fills up the bag with clothes.<n>2. A cashier helps with the payment and checking of grocery items that are bought to a customer, not bag after someone fills it.<n>3. A supermarket is a store where we buy household necessities and often clothes and shoes, but it is not related to where someone would get a bag after someone else fills it.<n>4.

A cat ladder allows a cat to move from one place to another on two or more levels.<n>2. A towel can be placed on the furry carpet to be used by the cat to move around without getting its claws stuck on the carpet.<n>3. A cat is used to getting on and off its bed, so it is useful to have a cat bed as a place for the cat to relax and nap in.<n>4. The cat claws can be trimmed back to a reasonable size, thus ensuring that they don't end up stuck to the carpet.<n>5. The last option doesn't really answer the question of what will help the cat not get its claws stuck in a carpet.<n>6. Therefore, the option that answers the question is B: throw a toowel on the carpet.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What chore might a child have to do after breakfast, before getting on the bus? Choices:  A: drop out of school B: ask questions C: enter school D: wash dishes E: read book<n><n>### Response:		The child must do C: enter school before the school bus arrives.<n><n>### Demo:<n>1. The given sentence asks us for a time based activity after breakfast, before school.<n>2. The first thing that comes to mind is the daily routine of the child, and the question is basically looking for tasks.<n>3. Let’s check options, A: drop out of, B: asked questions, C: enter and D: wash dish.<n>4. Option “dropped out of” refers to leaving something, but it doesn’ have to be school.<n>5. So, we can rule it out.<n>6. We also cannot say school as a whole or classroom as a whole as it's just a place where we study.<n>7. Option B: asked questions cannot be an answer as asked question means to ask a question and not do it.<n>8. Therefore “enter” is the only noun phrase that fits the answer.<n>9. So, the answer is C: enter.<n>10. In conclusion, the final answer is C: enter school.<n><n>### Response 2: The job description is too complicated. <n><n>### Demo Answer: <n>Let us break this up into smaller portions.<n><n>The first part of the sentence says that she wants to join.<n><n>Therefore, she is planning to either go to the company's office/site or applying through an online job portal.<n><n>The phrase in bold says that if she has to send her resume every week.

Choices:  A: raise corn B: seed plants C: grow plants D: seed crops E: farm land<n><n>### Response:		B:seed plants<n><n>### Instructions: Read the task carefully and answer the multiple choice question below it.<n>### Demonstator:<n>Input:The farmer chose ____ he could make bird feed___. Choices:  A. plants B. plants that C. plants would D. plants he planted the next year E. plants he planted this year<n>Rationales:<n>1. The phrase "he chose" tells us that the farmer chose from a list of items. However, we know what options he chose. That is birds feed, which is different from what he planted (plants he planted), and he planted them last year (plants he plants again the next year).<n>2. The farmer chose a combination of things, and you could argue that "what" refers to the most basic thing.<n>3. This means you can remove planted plants, and since you can't eat that, you don't have to worry about it.<n>4. Since the sentence specifically states that the farmer chose what would be next year's plants, the only appropriate option is B: plants. <n>5. Finally, only plants would be next year' plants, so none of the other options fit. <n>6. Hence, the answer choice is B: plants.<n>Answer: B Plants<n><n>### Input <n>The boy bought a shirt that was _____.

Choices:  A: confusion B: complications C: riot D: arrest E: protests<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The question is essentially asking you to provide another noun that is synonymous, or similar in meaning, to 'instituting civil action'.<n>2. The terms listed in the multiple choice answer are all acceptable options as they are all synonyms for 'instituting civil actions'. <n>3. The term 'instituting civil actions' asserts that you have the authority or power to institute (or carry out) civil procedures. This power is given in a civil action. Civil actions are court proceedings and they deal with the enforcement of rights, or the protection of an individual or a group's interests in a dispute. In essence, a civil action is a legal means of enforcing some other law or contract.<n>4. So basically, the question is asking us for synonyms for 'enacting laws'.<n>5. But, the terms in the answer are synonyms for 'civil action'. So, answer C is the correct choice.<n>6. Therefore, the answer to the question is C: civil actions.<n>Answer: C: civil actions<n><n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

Answer choice A, 'Ask the student to find their dictonary', is incorrect because the word 'dictionary' appears twice and refers to the same thing each time, so one dictionary should be provided.<n>2. Answer choice B, 'Provide dictionary for them', refers to the same dictionary that should have already been given to the student in answer choice A.<n>3.

One item used to style hair is the curling iron, which usually has the capability to create curls. It typically requires a special place to store or preserve the curling iron when it's not in use. <n><n>### Rationales: 1: C: use - We keep the curling iron around the house so we do not misplace it. <n>2: D: hair salon- We don't usually leave our curling iron in the hair salon so it doesn't get damaged so frequently we keep it in the bathroom that's clean.<n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What does a master carpenter use to put holes in objects? Choices:  A: drill B: learn C: require obedience D: understand E: spoon<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Demonstration:<n>1. The question is worded as follows: "What do (whom)/does (what) a carpenter use to drill holes?"<n>2. The subject of the sentence is the carpenter, so we need a noun to complete the noun phrase 'a carpenter.'<n>3. Option A: drill. A drill is a tool that a carpenter might use to create holes in different media. So, it completes the sentence fully and is the correct option.<n><n>Answer: D: Spread<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input: Who must be there to sign a document? Choices: <n>1. A: The sender, and a witness 2. B: The sender, and two witnesses 3. C: The recipient, and a witness 4. D: The notary <n>5. E: A spy<n><n>Demonstratiion:<n>The structure of the sentence is that which party in terms of the document should sign it. For this reason, we need to look at the document type.<n><n>Looking at the options<n><n>> 1.  The sentence states that the sender or the receiver should be present to sign the document. The other party, a witness, is not necessary for this document.<n><n>> 2.  There is reference to 2 witnesses. So 3 is not an option.<n><n>As stated earlier, we need to look out for document type.<n><n>> 3. Since the sender, or the receiver is not required to sign the document, a witness is also unnecessary.<n><n>> 4. There are two possible options, notary and spy. Now there cannot be a spy because it would be unbelievable if such a person exists. Thus, we remove it from the options and focus on the remaining candidate, notary. We know there is a notary because the previous sentence stated that the document will be notarised and then, the document will be stamped by him. Therefore, we are confident that the answer will be D: The notary.<n><n>> 5. This one will be the spy because it is unnecessary since the document will be notorised.<n><n>> 6. So, the correct option is D, the notary.<n><n>### In

Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank.

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where is a good place to buy moistener? Choices:  A: bathroom B: purse C: drug store D: hand lotion E: water<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>C: Drug store<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>The question asks for a suitable place to get a moistener. The first option, A: bathroom, is not suitable because although you may use the bathroom to get a moisturer, it would not be the most convenient location.<n>The second option, B: purse, is not suitable because it does not have a moistener.<n>The third option, C: drug store, is suitable because it frequently sells moisturizers.<n>The fourth option, D: hand lotion, is not suitable because a hand lotion is not always referred to as a moistener, and the sentence doesn't specifically mention that a hand lotion can be used as a moistener. So, option C: drug store is the answer.<n><n>### Extensions and Questions<n><n>1. The word "moistener" refers to an agent that adds moisture to skin.<n>2. According to the sentence, it is a good place to get it.<n><n>3. The sentence is asking whether a moistener is a good thing to buy; therefore, the correct choice should be the first option, B: drug store.<n><n>4. Option A: bathroom is not suitable because although many people may think that it's a good place to buy it as it offers moisture, the moistener that the question is asking for would usually be a product specifically designed to add moisture to skin, not to rinse off excess water.<n>5. Option B: purse is not suitable because this object does not have any moistener that can be used on the face.<n>6. Option C: Drug store is suitable because it's a place where a wide range of moisturizers are sold.<n>7. Option D: Hand lotion, is not valid because although it may include moisturizer as an ingredient, it is not a substance used to add it to the skin.<n>8. Consequently, the most fitting of all options is B: Drug store, because it is suitable and the one meant by the sentence.<n><n>### Question:<n><n>The first instruction stated that a noun was required to replace "the complex machine". Since "machine" is an adjective, an adjective should be used. The options are: <n>

The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3.

The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank.

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Danny was having fun singing in front of his class.   He has a lot of what? Choices:  A: laughter B: being happy C: glee D: opera E: injuries<n><n>### Response:		A: laughter<n><n>### Output:Danny was having great fun singing in front of class. He has a lot of laughter. He's really having fun.<n><n>### Feedback:In this sentence, we are referring to Danny’s enjoyment while singing, so Danny is having fun “singing”. The reason we use the term, laughter is that it is only appropriate in this scenario. Thus it is a correct match for laughter and, in fact, is the correct answer.<n><n><br><br>

Choices:  A: action B: demonstration C: understanding D: vote E: revolution<n><n>### Response:		B: demonstration<n><n>### Rationale: 1. Because the sentence says that a change in society caused by violent conflict is called a.<n>### Demonstración: Asociado: 1) Acción. Pagina: 245<n>### The sentence says that a change caused by violent conflict is termed a.<n>### 2. An 'action' is a purposeful movement or motion. It connotes an effort to do something, whereas revolution implies complete destruction and overthrow of something (in this case, a given society).<n>### 3. A 'demonstration' can be defined as a public show of support or opposition for something. It requires effort and action and, importantly, implies a more constructive approach.<n>### 4. A 'vote' refers to a formal way of deciding the opinion of a majority on some issue. As such, it is generally more associated with electoral politics.<n>### 5. 'Understanding' is used more as an adjective than a noun here; understanding someone involves a level of comprehension and empathy about them—they are not directly responsible for a violent conflict or change.<n>### 6. A'revolution' is the forcible overthrow of an existing government or political system. Although a revolution could take place after a violent conflict, it is not synonymous with one.<n>### 7. Hence, the only choice that closely fits the meaning of the sentence is 'demonstration'.<n>### The correct term is B: demonstration. <n><n>### Demostración: Asociado 2: Pagina:250  <n>### A demonstration can be defined as a means of communication from one person/group to another which, in the case of this sentence, is a public show of support rather than violence. <n>### 1.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where does someone lay with their leg elevated when it's broken? Choices:  A: spinning wheel B: on a ladder C: hospital bed D: legroom E: grand piano<n><n>### Response:		In this question, ‘lay with’ is a prepositional phrase; ‘with their leg elevated’ is the prepositional complement and ‘when it's broken’ is the complementizer. We can thus answer this question by locating where the prepositional phrase “with their leg elevated” takes place.<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The first option, “spinning wheel”, refers to a mechanical device often used for recreational purposes, not an actual location for the leg, so this option can be eliminated.<n>2. Option B: “on a ladder” does not reflect the context of the sentence when the leg is broken, so it cannot be chosen as the correct answer.<n>3. “Legroom” and “hospital bed” are not suitable choices.<n>4. Therefore, the sentence is asking for a location where a person might lie with a broken leg when it is elevated, so the answer should refer to where the broken leg is actually located.<n><n>### Answer: E: grand piano<n>

Choices:  A: boot B: the desert C: loaf of bread D: foot E: hock<n><n>### Response:		<n>The sentence demands that the phrase 'found on' is modified by a noun phrase. The choice C, loaf of bread; is not correct because a loaf of bread is a food item. The correct answer to the question is D, foot. A and B both are not appropriate choices. Choice E, hock; indicates the rear part of the hock of a hoofed animal. So, it is not the appropriate choice either.<n><n>Input:When my niece said my friend is a cat, I thought _______.

The correct choice is 5. The other choices are not suitable.<n>```<n>Input:The woman has an elegant dress and her eyes _______. Choices 1: are black<n>2: shine<n>3: shoe<n>4: are brown<n>5: are golden<n><n>### Response <n>The sentences demands that the phrase "and her eyes" is modified by an adjective. The choice 2, "shine" is not correct as "eyes" are not able to shine. The other choices are incorrect too.<n>```<n>Input：Where do you get petroleum?

The correct answer is 5. The choice 1, 'from burning petrol'; is not correct as a petrol is not used for burning. The choice 2:'from a fire';, indicates a location for petroleum not its source. The choice 4:' from a burning car', is incorrect due to it's similarity to choice 2. Likewise, it too refers to a source of petroleum.

Choices:  A: inside the book B: oral report C: library D: fileing cabnet E: card catalogue<n><n>### Response:		Answer the question appropriately using the information above.<n>Rationales:1. "He had an index card" means he found the card and returned it somewhere, so it was no longer index. <n>2. "index card" could be the noun in oral report, library, fileing cabnet, card catalogue, etc. After all, the card must have ended up somewhere.<n>3. Only choice B: oral report contains "oral report" which is not used but has the proper word as to what the sentence is looking for.

However the elevator might be unavailable for some reason like a repair or maintenance so it would be a bad idea for the John to get an elevator. If the elevator were available then it would ofcourse be the best answer.<n><n>Answer: A: space shuttles have a much higher risk than elevators. This could have been worded better, but this is a fairly typical example of a multiple choice answer for an engineering technical aptitude test.<n><n>1. Input: John is a human who is a space shuttle due to an accident. Where would he go to the third floor of an apartment building?<n>2. Choices: A: space shipping B: detroit C starks D downtown E elevator<n>3. Rationale: A "space shuttle" is not an option -- It will be an objectionable answer for a number of reasons (perhaps a space shuttle is an elevator) and should always be disregarded in any technical aptitude test. <n>4. As in the example above, the question asks where he would go to the third floor. Option E is the logical answer to the question. <n>5. Though a car is an object, a car is not an elevator and should be disregarded as an answer. <n>6. Option B is a place Detroit should be ruled out for the same reason option A is.<n>7. Option C would be stairs, which is not an appropriate answer to the question presented in the prompt. It states that he would go to the "third floor of his apartment."<n>8. Finally, we have option D. The answer, elevator, is obvious from the context of the prompt. <n>9. Therefore, the true answer is E: elevator.<n><n>Answer: E: elevator<n>

Choice A: Front Door is incorrect because if something is found in the front door, it has to be the front door of the person who has found it. But it’s an exspeciation.<n> <n>3. “Their box” refers to the person who has found the box unlocked and their items are stolen. So, if their box is open, something must really be wrong.<n> <n>4. Choice B: Newspaper is incorrect because no newspaper could be stolen from the same or any home as that of the thief.<n> <n>5. Choice C: Post Office is incorrect because it’s a place to deliver the letters or anything in the mail by hand, but it’s an expeciation.<n> 6.

There are still some little problems to fix but otherwise his thing works.<n>4. He felt like a million bucks because his thing was amazing!!<n>5. He felt sad. He was going to change the world, and then nobody wanted to use his thing.<n>6. He felt sad. His thing was amazing and nobody cared.<n>7. He felt good because he was excited about his idea.<n>8. The other options are not good.<n><n>### The Machine<n><n>Input: The Machine was working, it was producing electricity, but it was not yet producing any power. It was an exciting challenge. The sentence is asking, What was wrong with the machine? <n><n>A: It needed more power. B: It had no electricity. C: It was outdated. D: It was inefficient. E: It was broken.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Input: The machine works and was producing electricity but not the power yet the machine was an exciting challenge in solving. <n><n>This challenge could be referring to the task of solving a task not the challenge itself. Therefor, it is B: It had no electrictity. The machine was producing electriciy but no other power. The exciting challange of solving the problem.<n><n>### Example:<n><n>#### Sentence:<n>"Why do you have to go to school, you aren't smart enough?"<n><n>#### Response:<n>"Ok, that might be true, but I don't care, I go to school because I like it, and because I want a better future.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What is a negative effect to someone other than a spouse when two spouses are getting divorced? Choices:  A: lot of grief B: depression C: no spouse D: lose money E: children suffer<n><n>### Response:		<n>The term 'divorce' here refers to the dissolution of a marriage.<n>Therefore, the word'spouses' refers to the marriage partners.<n>However, the word'spouse' is also used as a noun on its own, denoting a husband or wife.<n>If the sentence were rephrased, eg "How does it effect a spouse when two people divorce?", then it would be clear that the word'spouse', in this context, just means husband or wife.<n>Therefore, A, C, and E are out.<n>Further, the phrase 'divorced couples' refers to the people whose marriage is dissolved.<n>In this case, the phrase 'divided couples' gives away the clue that the word 'counsellors' is being used to mean marriage counsellors.<n>Thus, the phrase 'division' should be replaced by 'couples', giving the answer B: division therapy for children. <n><n>### Input How will you define a triangle? Choices:  Choices:  A. 3 straight points B. A side C. Shapes D. Not triangular E. A single side<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>Both A and B seem possible definitions for a triangle.<n><n>The phrase "defines someone or something" means "represents or identifies someone or something."<n>So, a triangle could mean a triangle, but it could also mean someone who works for a company.<n>It would be better to be more specific and say what the triangle is.<n><n>### Analysis:<n>Letters should be capitalized when referring to specific companies and people.<n>

He loved the idea of going to mars, and reads books about it all the time.   He dreams of being on what? Choices:  A: love B: zoo C: school D: space shuttle E: library<n><n>### Response:		D: space shuttle<n><n>### Rationales:1. The options presented to us are not the only options. We can also use a different noun to describe "James's dream of being on another planet." <n>2. So, from the question, we can infer that the noun should describe something specific, and should also imply something which is far-off. <n>3. "Space shuttle" is a machine which is used for space exploration, so it works here, whereas "zoo" and "library" don't.<n>4. "Love", the first option, is a feeling or emotion. It implies that the feeling described to us should be for another planet, but it doesn't fit the context because it doesn't involve being on another planet. <n>5. Answers "B: zoo" and "C: school" are similar to the first option, and also don't match the context.<n>6. "Space-shuttle", the last option, is a place for going to other planets, which is why it's the correct choice. Hence, the answer according to the context is "D: space-shuttle".<n>7.

Choices:  A: inspiration B: much work C: boredom D: graduate E: degree<n><n>### Response:		Cause Boredom<n><n>### Rationale:<n>**1.**A school is an institution for teaching and learning, where students spend a large part of their childhood.<n>**2.**The phrase 'what you do' indicates that the response should identify what comes after attending school.<n>**3.**'Boredom' is the most apt answer because it is the next thing that a student encounters after attending school. They may be bored, for which there are a range of options, such as day-dreaming, napping, sleeping, watching TV or just staying quiet.<n>**4.**For the same reason 'inspiration' is ruled out as a choice. This is a word used when someone is inspired by someone or something. 'Graduating' is ruled out as it refers to a student completing their formal educations after attaining some academic degree.<n>**5.**Therefore, the only suitable answer is 'C: boredom'.<n><n>**7.**<n>

The input sentence asks what kind of land area is likely to contain the largest number of villagers<n>2. The first answer, rurual area, refers to a region that is mostly located outside of major cities, including fields and woods.<n>3. Although rural areas can contain populations, it is not the best choice, because there can be some remote villages in these areas, but many rural areas are quite isolated, making is unlikely to have a large village.<n>4. The second choice, big city, refers to major urban centers with densely populated cities.<n>5. It is unlikely for a large village to be located within a big city, as cities are usually too busy urban areas to have a large number of villagers who live nearby. <n>6. The third answer, suburb, is a common term that refers to neighborhoods located outside urban centers.<n>7. However,'suburb' is generally used to refer more to an area outside a big city, rather than a remote village, so it doesn't answer the prompt accurately.<n>8. The fourth answer, ohio, refers to the state in the Midwast region in the US. <n>9. 'Ohio' can't answer the question because it is not a specific geographical area, and it is not very likely to house a large village with many residents.<n>10. Finally, 'countryside' is also not a suitable answer, as it doesn't directly provide an answer to the prompt asking for the location containing the largest number of villager.<n>11. Therefore, the only correct answer is the 5th one: BIG CITY. <n>12.

Choices:  A: book B: meeting C: television D: guide E: newspaper<n><n>### Response:		The word 'traditionally' indicates that the question refers to a practice that has been used in the past, and we should look for answers that are old-fashioned. We might think about the ways of obtaining information that used to be common long before the internet, like asking someone to read a book for us, or consulting a dictionary at the library.

We can therefore eliminate A: bushes, C: books, D: heat lamps. Heat lamps provide artificial heat, which is different from sun's heat which is natural heat. Similarly, books cannot regulate body temperature which makes this incorrect. <n><n>The second line tells us that we need to answer the question with a phrase that can replace the phrase in the question. The phrase that must replace the question mark in the question is still hot rocks because even though this phrase is incorrect in this sentence. In other words, "regulate" is a verb phrase which cannot be replaced by a noun. There is no phrase that can replace the question mark. Hence, A: hot rocks must be our answer.<n>Answer: A: rocks<n>  <n>  <n>### Input:Today we'll do a presentation on the company's annual activity report. We need to create an impressive display with what? Choices: A: presentation B: slide Show C: slide presentation D: presentation slide show E: slide show presentation<n><n>### Response B: slide show<n>Rationales: Today’s presentation is on the company’s annual activity report, the display must be impressive, so we must add an appropriate noun to the end of slide show so that it can be an impressive display with, hence, slide show must be our answer. <n><n>### Input The train conductor is the man who operates which is a special type of switch? Choices: A : railB: train C: switch D: tracks E: button<n><n>### Response D: switch<n>Rationales: The sentence asks for a noun to match the blank. It must be a suitable choice that can be used instead of what is in the blank.<n><n>So, we can eliminate option B: rail, option E: button, and option C: switch, because they don't make sense in the sentence. <n><n>Next, we can eliminate option D: tracks because a track is not a type of switch and it is also
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where does a shadow usually appear? Choices:  A: suface of moon B: building C: bridge D: ground E: bright light<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Answers:D <n>**Output:** Shadows are the cast shadows of objects.<n>### Demonstation (Explanation):<n>1. This is a very open-ended question and it leaves a lot of room for interpretation.<n>2. We might want to add a prepositional phrase as well, such as "which appears on the surface of the Moon," for clarification. <n>3. To answer this question we need to think about where shadows usually appear.<n>4. There are many different possible answers to this question. <n>5. These possible answers will depend the circumstances of the question. For example, if it is given in the context of the natural world, then we could add the sun as a possible answer.<n>6. However, if it is given within the context of the built environment, we could add options such as a building or a bridge. <n>7. In the given sentences, there are no mentions of the sun or buildings, which is part of what makes it a good question. The answer should not rely on an outside circumstance, so if we add a mention of the sun or building, then the answer will no longer be correct. <n>8. Therefore, we answer this question by saying that shadows usually appear on the ground because no other answer contains this.<n>9. There is a phrase, "which appears on the ground," but this does not say "Where does a shadow appear," which is what the sentence asks. (Ground can be an answer, but we need to say which)<n>10. A shadow appears on the ground<n><n>### Difficulty:<n>### Hard  <n><n>### Answer:D<n><n>### Input and Instruction:<n><n>### Input<n>Input: Which is longer, a meter or a foot?

Choices:  A: hiding B: accidentally C: expectation D: knowingly E: planned<n><n>### Response:		Choices:  A: planned B: accidentally C is good D: expectation E: hidden<n><n>### Rationales: 1.The sentence implies that something was ruined and George is responsible for this. <n>2.In this sentence the use the word "surprise" doesn't mean shock or scare.<n>3.Then it has the meaning of unexpected something. <n>4.So the word plan could be possible because George doesn't known that he could ruined the surpris by doing the above answer so we should take option D as a correct answer.<n>5.In this question we need to understand the sentence.<n>6.The question is not about "ruined" but "How did George ruin the surprise"? <n>7.So we need to think about how the he ruin the surprise. <n><n>### Answer:  D: expectation<n><n>##### Instruction:<n><n>Input:  There were no signs of fire.

We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where above your kitchen sink could you store canned food?

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3.

Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n><n>### Response:		Scotland<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Instruction talks of a place where a road know as motorway existed<n>2. We have to pick a place that has motorways<n>3. This rules out Europe ( option c) and new jersey (option d)<n>4. Hence, we are left with england and Scotland<n>5. Hence option e is correct because Scotland is known to have motorways<n>6. Option (e) answers the question correctly<n>7. Hence the correct answer is e i.e Scotland<n><n>### Input : Where is a road known as the ring road? Choices:  A London B: Bristol C: Manchester D: Leeds E: Sheffield<n><n>### Response : London<n><n>### Rationale: The instruction talks of the known road as ring road<n><n>### Now, we have to find a road which is called ring road in a certain place.<n><n>### We can rule out Sheffield for having ring road, as Bristol does as well<n><n>### So, we are left England where the ring road is present in London.<n><n>### So option a is the correct answer<n><n>### Rationals: Whenever the instruction mentions a thing or place with respect to particular thing. Then a particular thing means it only is answerable to the instruction.<n><n>### Input  : what part do your teeth need most cleaning? Choices: i) The roof ii) front iii) back iv) gums v) roots<n><n>### Response iii) Back <n><n>### Ratiocination:  When the instruction says "what do your teeth need most" then teeth should be used.<n><n>### When it asks where, it should be a geographical area.<n><n>### Back has nothing to do with front tooth nor a roof.<n><n>### Thus option viii should be selected as the answer.<n><n>### Final Notes:  When the instruction specifies a part with respect to the place it is located, only that part should be used in the answer.

Choices:  A: make friends B: mingle C: meet people D: small talk E: meet new people<n><n>### Response:		Choice C : Meet people  is the correct answer to the above question. <n>### Rationales: 1- Meet is a verb and requires a direct object hence C: meet people is the only feasible choice 2 - meet is also a noun as you can meet a specific person meaning you can meet a relative or someone 3- The sentence structure is a simple clause that has a verb in it so C: meet people  is very much correct. <n>### Answer: Choice C : meet people<n><n>### Input : Where does he usually go to unwind? Choices:  B: party C: home D: school E: library<n><n>### Response : Choice D : school <n><n>### Rational: 1 - The sentence talks about "unwind" that gives you another clue for where he usually goes to because "unwind = relax" 2 - Party is an action verb and therefore it is a suitable answer to the question in option A:  and B:  that are asking where does he usually goes. That is the problem. 3 - He "usually" goes to school. It is not an action word and it describes the situation. So D: go to school <n>is the correct answer. <n>###  Answer : Choice D : School.<n><n>### Input;  Where do we usually go swimming? Choices:  C: the sea D: the river E: swimming pool<n>### Response Choice D :  river is more feasible <n>### Rationale: 1 - The use of the term "usually " suggests that the subject "we" go to certain places "swimminigg". 2 - The sentence also tells you that it refers to the "Sea or river" as it says where we usually "swim". 3 - It is always better to provide a specific answer as it adds more detail to sentences that are vague by nature.<n><n>### Answer : Choice D: river<n><n>### Input Where do you park your car?

THEREFORE HAND is HUMAN<n><n>Rationale: 1. The question is asking which part of a human body the lips are on.<n>2. Our first instinct is to rule out option A: mouth, because that’s not the part of a human being that the lips are on. However, if we look at it carefully, it might be possible to say that the mouth is the lips of the human body.<n>3. Option B: jars and face, is inappropriate because although jars and faces are both objects that we might put our mouth on, it’s not what the question is asking about.<n>4. Option C: Kentucky Fried Chicken, is a food type.<n>5. Option D: hand does fit the structure of the question, but it refers specifically to a hand, not the human body.<n>6. Finally, option E: human is exactly what the question asks for.<n>7. There is no correct sentence that makes sense.<n>8. Therefore the answer is E: human. <n>Answer: E: human.<n><n><n>### Output:<n><n>#### This is my body:<n><n>#### (The human body is on the left and there's a human sitting as an illustration of the whole body below)<n><n>### Body Parts & Body Names (body parts)<n><n>### Instructions: <n><n>### Instructors can provide the text underneath with the headings for students to use.<n><n>### Responses: <n>* <n>  1.

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:If you hit someone while driving what could happen to that person? Choices:  A: deaths B: get arrested C: moving D: using gas E: may die<n><n>### Response:		It could result in deaths<n>Response: It could result in deaths, not deaths. <n><n>### Input-The car ran into someone while driving. <n><n>## Response-It could result in death.<n>Response-It could result in the death.<n><n>### Justification<n>1. The sentence asks about the possible consequences of reckless driving, and the answer must reflect this.<n>2. Option A: death seems to imply that the person will actually die, but that’s not what we’re looking for. Option B: get arrested may suggest that the driver will be punished, but we want to focus on the possible consequences of the driver’s actions.<n>3. Additionally, the sentence suggests that a car was involved; a person is not capable of driving a car, nor is a car capable of driving itself, so the only option that reflects this is option C: moving.<n>4. Option D: using gas implies that the car may suddenly speed up, causing the death or injury of pedestrians, but it doesn’ t relate to the driver him/ herself. <n>5. Option E: may die fails to focus on the driver. <n>6. Therefore, the only option that reflect that the driver had something to do with the death and that it can also involve the driver would be option C: Moving.

The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

In this city.<n>Rationales: The sentence starts with a question "Where do we live?", in which the speaker is asking where do we live? "A. There" is an answer to the question where do we live?, which can't be used. "B. The house" means that we lives in house, it is incorrect. "C. The neighborhood" is about the neighborhood where we live, but it is not exact an answer. "D. In this country" means in this country, we live. "In this city" also means the same, we live in this city, which is correct. So, options B, C, D can't be correct. "A. There" only refers to "there" in "where" which is "A. There" which is incorrect.

"The shark was migrateing between contients", this tells us that the shark is migrating between two places.<n>2. Where the shark was found is also the answer.<n>3. From B to E, A is impossible because a migrating shark would never be found in fresh water.<n>4. Then, B is removed, because the ocean is open and has no boundaries.<n>5. C and E are both locations.<n>6. Finally, the shark was found in a coral reef, so the answer is C: open ocean.<n>Answer: C: open ocean<n>

Choices:  A: university B: college class C: class room D: classroom E: library<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>> *The best answer is College Class. James was a university student. He attends the university because he wants to study. The classes at university classes don't allow us to spend time in the library or at home. The best solution for James was to get to the university, and go to his classes. College classes are the place that he wants to be at, because that's where he should spend time studying for his report.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The instruction explains that we're looking for a location, not a person. So, option A: University doesn't make sense, given that James is a student there who has a report due. Option B: College class is the best match, as classes are where students can spend time studying. Option C: Classroom doesn't work, because James is a student studying elsewhere, not in a classroom. Option D: Classroom might seem like a reasonable choice, but it doesn't fit with the constraints of the question. Option E: Library would make sense for a librarian or other library staff member, but not for James, who is a student who may go to classes with books instead of libraries.<n><n>### Output: James needs to write the report and go to college classes where he can spend most of his time.<n><n>### Notes<n><n>> *It's important to read the question closely before answering, so that you understand the constraints of the situation. This can help you to choose the best answer that fits the situation.

The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What type of water transportation is human powered? Choices:  A: turn away B: let down C: have to sleep D: run E: row boat<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>- C: Rowboat <n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1. "What kind of" immediately indicates that the following answer should refer to transportation that is human powered.<n><n>2. "Human powered" refers to using one's own power rather than an external source for any kind of transportation which implies the vehicle should be human powered as well.<n><n>3. Hence the answer is C: Rowboat.<n><n>4. "Turn away" and "sleep" are not related to the query and the answer in any way.<n><n>5. "Let down" could be used in relation to water transportation but not with just humans in it.<n><n>6. So the options that don't answer the query, are A: "Turn away", B: "Lay down", D: "Run".<n><n>7. The answer is C: "Rowboat".

They buy items in stores.<n>For option C mail orders, the customer doesn’t pay the merchant with money. They place the order or give their order to the staff in the store and they pay for the items they purchase in the store.<n>For option D spend money, customers spend money in the store purchasing items or services.<n>Option E demand satisfaction is related to the sales staff. They don’t demand anything, they fulfill the customers’ demands for items as needed. Therefore, as long as customers are satisfied, they will come back to the store. And the customers are satisfied when the sales staff fulfill their needs.<n>For that reason, the only options that are correct to fit the sentence are B and D.<n>For explanation, option A is incorrect, option C is incorrect, option B is correct, option D is correct, and so option E is correct.<n>Answer: B and D<n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What eastern state is home to a mountain?

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: medicine chest C: armpits D: grocery store E: kitchen<n><n>### Response:		<n>The sentence asks us where you can "buy" deodorant. Deodorant is a product used to keep yourself smell nice and keep you from perspiring or to neutralize body odor. So, we can eliminate option B: medicine chests, and option C: armpits, since neither of them is a place to buy deodorant, and option A: medicine cabinet, since that isn't an available option.<n><n>There are five places you can go to "buy" deoderant, which are (in order):<n><n>  * Option D: grocery stores<n>  * Option E: kitchen<n>  * Option C: drugstores<n>  * Option B: Walmart<n>  * Option A: Walgreens<n><n>However, option D: grocery and option E: kitchen can be eliminated as places to buy deodorant. So, we're left with options A: Walgreens, B: Walmart, and C: drugstore.<n><n>The sentence can be modified by removing the word "but," which means you should replace it with a suitable substitute. We can replace the word "but" with "and."<n><n>You can "buy" (deodorant) at any of the following places:<n>A) (Walgreens)<n>B) (Walmart)<n>C) (drugstore)<n><n>Now, we have three choices. So, we combine each of the choices and we get:<n><n>  * You can buy (deodorant) in (A)Walgreens, (B)Walmart, or (C)drugstore.<n><n>As a final note of importance: it's important to note that option C: drugstore is a redundant choice, since you would buy deoderant at a drugstore.<n><n>You can get rid of option C: drugstore to make another shorter sentence:<n><n>  * Now you can buy (deodorants) at (A) Walgreens, (B Walmart, or (A) drugstores.<n><n><n>### Input : What are the reasons for the decrease in traffic accidents?

C is the place where we expect the food served to be.<n>2. However in the question is given the center, so the option C: "church basement" can't be the correct answer.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>3. At receptions, the bride sits at the head table, the groom sits at the center and the guests are seated in rows toward the back of the reception area. So, the bride and groom are at the front of the room, while the guests are at the rear, forming the corridor.<n><n>### Response to "Explanation"<n><n><n>

Yes, the right answer is B: lie down for bed.<n><n>### Input2: What should I do to make a cake?<n><n>### Response2:<n>The sentence is asking for a verb that can be used to make a cake. There are a number of nouns that we can use in this situation, such as flour, eggs, etc., but we need a verb. So, the answer is A: Add the flour, milk, oil, eggs, sugar, etc.<n><n>### Response<n>1: Include a comma or period before the question mark.<n>    Input: What do you do?

The first word of the phrase is "What" which indicates we have to find the answer for this question.<n>2. Next we need to figure out the purpose for the question since what is asking for.<n>3. In this case, the question is wanting to know what prevents people from getting sleep.<n>4. 4. Looking at the list of options, all of them are a possible reason for not sleeping.<n>5. However, there is only one reason that can fulfil the question, the "restness"<n>6. The word "restlessness" refers to a feeling of constant anxiety caused by being unable to rest easily.<n>7. So, "restlessness is the only answer that accurately answers the question.

The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3.

Choices:  D: William Shakespeare A: Mark Twain B: James Hadley Chase C: Jane Austen D: T.S. Eliot<n>Rationales:1. Option D: William Shakespeare, as given here by the author, is a proper noun or “proper name” which should be used to refer to a person, as in “William Shakespeare.”<n>2. Option B: James Hadley. Chase is a proper name, as it refers to a person, in this case, an author.<n>3. Option A: Mark Twain, given as such is also a proper name, which refers to a person.<n>4. Option C: Jane Austen. This is also a proper name which refers to a person, though it might be better to write it without the apostrophe (i.e., instead of Jane’s, write Jane). This option and option E, T.S. Eliots are similar in the sense that they are the proper name of authors, but they occur in the reverse order, Eliot’s first name appearing before his last. This is known as an open preposition (a preposition that may come before the first word in a noun group). Hence, it might be better to use the more common order of Eliot’s (as in T.S. Eliott or T.S Eliot). <n>5. Option E: T.S. The phrase is incorrect; it has a missing noun. The sentence should read, "What is the name of that author you told me about?"

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:When people want to watch a new move, the often go see it at the?

Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>E<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Where refers to a location or place. The room with many chairs is a different location from where you purchase the ticket.<n>2. The room would likely be a place where a conference takes place or at a conference center.<n>3. Churches hold services and have seats where people can sit and pray or hear sermons.<n>4. Theaters have a large stage where acts are performed, sometimes in front a large audience. These seats are likely the ones facing the same direction.<n>5. Similar to a theatre, the building would be holding a class or holding events. Seating might be arranged for people to sit in the same direction facing in the same way.<n>6. Some large companies have a floor that hosts training sessions or seminars where employees can obtain new skills. They may have seats arranged in the same direction.<n>7. A building would have many floors and many rooms, it would not specify a room.<n><n># Input: What would you do if you forgot your house keys?

Option C is incorrect because there are no two doors, and no key to a third way into the house. Option D is also incorrect because a door lock is not two locks. Option E is incorrect because the way is broken before you open it. The correct answer is option A: call it a loss<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>How would you complete the request or task?<n><n>### Response or Demonstration: <n>A<n><n>### Rationale and/or explanation: <n>You could break into the house in various ways, but only one of them is logical: Call it a loss.

The first sentence has been tried for you.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. “What” asks us to choose one of the options to complete the sentence.<n>2. The first sentence starts with “any “, implying that all of the options can be the right choice to follow “which of the following”.<n>3. Therefore, “anyone” can mean the option “all”.<n>4. So, all of the options can fit this sentence.<n>5. So, it's correct to say, “any of these.”<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: Which of the following is not true about the moon? Choices: 1.It is bigger 2. It does not have its own light 3. It has no atmosphere<n>Rationales: Demonstration: I choose 4. It has no atmosphere. The reason is that it isn't a planet but a natural satellite. Therefore, the sentence doesn't make sense, which is why it is incorrect.<n>1. "Which of the following" initially tells us that we have several possibilities to choose from.<n>2. "Not" indicates that not all of the options are true.<n>3. "True about the moon" implies that the sentence is asking if there's anything true about the moon.<n>4. The list of options is made up of four possible answers to the question.<n>5. "False" means exactly what is said.<n>6. Hence, the answer in this case is 4.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:The window across the street was broken and John felt guilty. He never meant to damage what? Choices:  A: friend's house B: curtains C: space shuttle D: front door E: classroom<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The window across the street that broke is John's neighbour’s house, rather than the object itself. In addition, he is worried about hurting his friend’s feelings. The neighbours house is damaged by John and John doesn’t want to have any regrets about hurting the friend's feelings and damaging the house. Hence, the answer choice is D: front door, neighbour’s house and friend’s feelings.<n><n>### Input<n>The man is very kind, but a bit of a bore. Answer the following questions about him. Choices:  A) His job is dangerous. B) He has a bad habit. C) He is very healthy. D) He is very kind. E) He likes to read. F) He is very health conscious.<n>Rationales:<n>1. He is kind, but he seems to be also a bit boring or maybe even boring.<n>2. He isn't very dangerous, he has a job that is boring. <n>3. He is very kind, but he is also a bit boring.<n>4. He likes to read is not a choice since "answer the following questions about him" in the beginning indicates that our subject is a man.<n>5. He isn't healthy, because he isn't very health conscious. He eats very healthful foods and exercises a lot.<n>6. A man is healthy so we choose D.<n>7. Answer:D.<n><n>### Response<n>The man is very good and kind at his job, but has a habit of being boring.<n><n>### Task 5<n><img src="./assets/images/caps3.jpg" width="600" height="300" />

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:A person notices popcorn, cotton candy on the grass, where is he likely? Choices:  A: soccer game B: fairgrounds C: movie theatre D: countryside E: state park<n><n>### Response:		<n>C: movie theatre because the grass might be the place where people who go to the movies will park their cars. <n>A: soccer game, because most people go to sporting games where you might see cotton candy and popcorn.<n>B: fairgrounds - you'll find popcorn and cotton candy there when it's a seasonal fair.<n>D: countryside - it's easy to believe that a person might find popcorn and/or cotton candy in the countryside.<n>E: state park - because people who go camping might take these types of snack,s with them.<n>Answer:C: movie theatre<n><n>### Input<n>A pizza place and a cereal manufacturer are neighbors. What do they trade? Choices: <n>A: cereal <n>B: pizza <n>C: cereal box<n>D: pizza box<n>E: cereal<n><n>### Rationales<n>F: cereal box, the cereal manufacturer trades its products with its neighbors.<n>A: pizza, the pizza place trades its products with other businesses.<n>B: pizza box the cereal manufacture doesn't need pizza boxes.<n>D: pizza place, the pizza place doesn't need cereal boxes.<n>E: cereals, the cereal munufacturer sells its products to other businesses.<n><n>### Answer<n>cereal box.<n>Answer: F: cereal box

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:In war, your primary method is combat, but your goal is to do what? Choices:  A: conquer opponent B: fight enemy C: join army D: kill E: terrible<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: In war, your primary method of combat is to do what?  Rationales: 1) The correct answer can be determined by breaking down the question into two parts: 'In war, your primary' and'method of combat is to do'. As such,'method of combat' is the independent clause and 'do what' is the dependent clause. <n>2) The first option, 'conquer the opponent', doesn't follow the correct part of speech; 'conquer' is a verb that can't be modified by 'what'.<n>3) The second option, 'fight the enemy', is an example of an appropriate phrase which can complete the sentence.<n>4) Next, the third option, 'join the army', is not a suitable answer because although it conveys the idea of fighting, it doesn't accurately reflect the primary method of combat.<n>5) The next option, 'kill', is not a suitable response either. Though it is true that killing is part of combat, 'kill' isn't the primary method of combat in war, as suggested in the question.<n>6) Hence, the correct response is B: fight the enemy.<n>Answer: A: fight the enemy<n><n>Input:In war, your main aim is to defeat who? Choices: 1. A: the enemy 2. B: the opponent 3. C: the army 4. D. You<n><n>### Response<n>Input:In war your primary method of combat should be ______? Choices:  a. killing the enemy b. Fighting against enemy c. Flying to enemy d. joining army<n><n>### Response <n>The question asks for your primary method of combat. Filling it in with "flying to the enemy" or "being in the army" would not make any sense. The only valid option that can fill in the blank is "Killing enemy", which is the second option to choose from. So, the answer is B.<n><n>Answer: B: killing the enemy<n><n><br><n><n>If you do not completely understand it, please ask. I will answer, but I would suggest asking somebody else too so that your speaking partners have a chance to learn something as well.<n>

Choices:  A: diary B: city C: bible D: graffiti E: labyrinth<n><n>### Response:		<n>**D** Because you only read passages, there is no need to write it there. So you would read a passage and not write it in the labyrinth.

Choices:  A: two feet B: two ears C: horns D: lay eggs E: one head<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Input: What do all humans have on their head? Choices A: two feet, B: two ears, C: horns, D: lay eggs, E: one head<n>Rationales:<n>1. The sentence is asking about the one thing that all humans have on the head.<n>2. The options can be answered by asking a question that starts with an antonym of "all". So, "what animals do not have" will give us all the possible antonyms.<n>3. As horns don't grow on humans, B is wrong.<n>4. So, A is incorrect, too.<n>5. The word "two" in the question means "two of the same thing". Therefore, option C will not be correct as humans do not have horns.<n>6. We will, therefore, choose B: two ears.<n>Answer: B -  two ears<n><n><n>---<n><n># Instruction:<n>Write the letter of the vocabulary term that matches each of the letters in the words below.

Choices:  A: university B: concert C: home D: terminal E: airport<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer B: a concert <br/><n>Explanation: We know that "highly criticized" should refer to a security that is high. But "home" cannot do this. It's not secure. "Terminal" is also wrong. It's also not secure. "University" is not secure. (What school is the most unstable?) "Airport" is insecure.<n><n>### Input :  What should I do to fix up the problem? <br/><n>### Response: <n>(Answer should be (A) or (B) ).

Choices:  A: feel pleasure B: look attractive C: compliments D: interesting experiences E: joy<n><n>### Response:		Makeup is meant to enhance a person’s physical appearance. There are many reasons for doing so, such as finding oneself more attractive and improving one’s self-confidence. However, while the result is often to look more desirable, the process doesn’t always succeed in getting the desired compliments or making for interesting conversations. In many cases, people want to feel good about themselves or present themselves better to others.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>- Choice A: feel pleasure: Makeup is a part of a beauty routine and is not meant to gain pleasure. It is a way for a person to present themselves to the world. Makeup is not about feeling pleasure.<n>- Choice B: look attractive: Makeup is not about getting attention from a particular person. It is to enhance a person's looks and to make them look like they are confident. Makeup is not a form of attractiveness.<n>- Choice C: compliments: Although people may do makeup to look more attractive or to be pleasing, the goal is not necessarily to get compliments. People can get compliments for various reasons, such as their personality, or even their clothes, but makeup is a tool to enhance how they present themselves. Compliments cannot be used to describe the purpose of makeup. <n>- Choice D: interesting experiences: Makeup is not meant to make an experience. People use makeup for different reasons, such as to make themselves feel more confident and to enhance their beauty. Makeup experiences are not a common topic of discussion. There are various interests, but makeup is not one of them.<n>- Choice E: joy: Makeup is not simply about getting joy. People use makeup because of the benefits that it has on them. The only way to explain the purpose of makeup is to say that it enhances the physical appearance of the person wearing it.<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Instructions:A person is putting up pictures of their children.

Choices:  A : it's a what? B : a flasher C: It's a storm D: Lighting E: a big lighting.<n><n>### Rationales: 1: You must understand you need to find noun for "the ship" to answer the question. Hence, the response will be either a noun of "ship", or a noun of a "lightning". That means you don't need to replace "ship" with "lightning" to make your response sentence true.<n>2. "it's" doesn't have a subject, hence you don't need it as it is.<n>3. "lighting" is grammatically incorrect, so you can't use it as a response since it's not grammatically correct.<n>4.  "a flasher" does not answer the question correctly, since we don't want "a" in our response. Moreover, "a flasher" is not the correct way to ask someone who has a flash tattoo.<n>5. The response is either A or B, but not A or C. You can rule out A in the beginning because it is just not the correct noun for "the lightning".<n>6. "D" is a noun phrase, you don't use a noun phrase to write a response. Moreover, it refers to the storm not a "lightning". <n><n>### Response-B : Lightning <n><n>### Explanation: B: lightning <n><n>## Instructions:<n>Instructions:<n>1. Read each sentence.<n>2.

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:James kept a clipboard where he could easily find  it.  Where might he keep it? Choices:  A: shelf B: place of work C: desk D: office supply store E: school<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. "Where" generally refers to a location, so the first part of the sentence already gives an indication that the answer must be in some way related to a place.<n>2. "Might" also indicates that there are a number of potential choices for James to keep his clipboard, and there doesn't have to be a single place where he keeps it.<n>3. So James may have a certain amount of flexibility in his choice of location, though we don't know what that amount is.<n>4. "Keep" may not actually refer to keeping the clipboard, but could also be used as a general term meaning that James probably stores it somewhere.<n>5. After considering all of these potential explanations, we now make a quick check of option A: shelf, but this option is not suitable because shelves are generally used to keep things in a fixed position which isn't possible for the clipboard.<n>6. This option is excluded from consideration. <n>7. Next we check option C: desk, because desks can often hold various kinds of items, and this could include a clipboard.<n>8. However, we can reject this option as well because a desk is often considered to be a more permanent form of storage, and placing a clipboard on a desk may not always be the most practical thing to do.<n>9. Moving on to option D: office supply store, we see that this may be where James buys a clipboard, but it isn't a place where he would be expected to keep it.<n>10. Further, he may not necessarily buy clipboards from this place, and even if he did, it still wouldn't be somewhere where he would keep them.<n>11. As a result, this option is also excluded. <n>12. We then check option E: school because schools often store items that are used in classes, including clipboards.<n>13. However, this option is excluded again because James is not necessarily expected to keep his clipboard at school even though he does use it.<n>14. Lastly, we reach the final option F: place of work.<n>15. A place of work is generally a more permanent form of where one expects an item to be stored, and it fits easily after the word "place", so it works nicely in the sentence.<n>16. Considering all the potential explan

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car.

Choices: A: No B: Yes C: Never D: Not likely E: Not in the picture.<n>Rationales: The picture is a group of people, excluding the respondent.<n>1. The answer given in the picture is a group of three people, one being the respondent, two others being the other option.<n>2. The answer is the teacher, since the teacher is in the same row with the respondent.<n>3. The answer is the sister because the sister is standing very close to the teacher.<n>4. The answer is unlikely the sister because there is a man walking with no shoes behind the teacher.<n><n>###  The picture is showing four people in the picture.<n>5. Therefore, the answer has to be D: Not in the picture or E: Not likely.<n>6. The answer is E: Not likely because the teacher might be in the other row.<n>7. The answer is E.

Choices:  A: house B: den C: family room D: wood E: floor<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The question basically wants us to say where a bed chair should sit, so the answer should be a place where you use it.<n>2. The term family room doesn’t refer to a place, it refers to a person's family. The word 'family' denotes the whole set of people, there is no specific room we can point to as a member's room. Hence, it does not fit the question and can be eliminated as an option.<n>3. Looking at choices B: den and D: wood. Choice B: den is a place where you could sit on a chair, but we don't refer to the chair as the place where you sit on it, and the den is not the place where the bean bag chair sits on.<n>4. So that eliminates choice B: den. 5. The next option, D: wood is not a place to sit where the bean bag chair will be placed.<n>6. So that also eliminates choice D: wood.<n>7. Choice E: floor is a place to sit, however we can't say that it is a place to place a bean bag chair on top of it.<n>8. So, this also should be eliminated.<n>9. So that leaves choice C: family room.<n>10. It refers to a place where everyone in the family sits. It has the ability to hold two people and it has to place something on top of it. A bean bag chair should lie on top off it, so it is the right choice. <n>11. So, the answer is C: family room. 12. The answer is C: family

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Billy's mother tripped over a stuffed animal.  She yelled at him not to leave his things where? Choices:  A: toy store B: hall C: bathroom D: amusement park E: fairgrounds<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>This is so hard, I think the correct answer is B: hall.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>- The sentence asks us where Billy's mother tripped.<n>- In line 1, 'a stuffed animal' refers to the specific toy that Billy's mother trips over, not just any toy or stuffed animal.<n>- This also suggests that Billy's mother didn't trip over too many items, so the answer isn't the 'toy store', where she would have to trip to numerous toys to reach the particular stuffed animal.<n><n>- The sentence indicates that the stuffed animal was placed in Billy's room, so it is most likely in the room rather than some other place in the house.<n><n>- We can eliminate the answer options A: toy store, B: hall, C: bathroom, and D: amusement park, as they are not the correct locations for the stuffed animal. <n><n>- The other answer option, E: fairgrounds, seems too distant a location, and it is not likely the stuffed animal is there, so it cannot be the correct answer. <n>- Option A: hall is the only remaining answer, because we can see that Billy's mother is tripping over a specific stuffed animal and we can also see where she is tripping over the stuffed animal. We can see that the hall, as the location, is a suitable place in which Billy's mother tripe over a stuffed animal, and the only word to describe this place is A: hall. <n>This answer is A: hall.<n><n>Answer: B: hall<n><n>### Input:'Where is the book shop?'

Choices:  A: concert B: opera C: theater D: take class E: television<n><n>### Response:		We will be watching the opera on the show. <n><n>### Demostration:<n>1. The sentence asks which long saga will be shown on tonight's episode. Sagas have to be long, and saga must be in the plural. <n>1. The second option A: concert is not in the plural, as it end with con. Although concerts are generally considered long, a single concert is not a long saga.<n>2. The next option B: opera is not in the plurarl, as its ends in A. Although opera may be considered a long saga, it doesn't fit the plurral structure as a single opera is not a long sage.<n>3. The third option C: theater is a plural word, but theater does not have a long saga. Theater is also used to refer to a specific place or building where plays are performed. <n>4. Similarly, the last option, D: take class, may be used to refer to classes, but, again, it does not have the singular structure required for the question.<n>5. Therefore, options B: opera, C: theater, and D: take class cannot be the correct answer.<n>6. The two remaining options are in the plural, so they are all viable choices.<n>7. However, E: television cannot be the answer as the text does not state why television will be watching. (There may be other ways to answer this question but they are not listed here.) <n>8.

The second sentence is asking for the fuel. <n>    A fuel doesn't come from petrol station.<n><n>3. "Gasoline" means "petrol". It is only a synonym for the word petrol.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:He finally found someone as ugly as him, knowing he wouldn't be the one sticking out was what? Choices:  A: gorgeous B: handsome C: pleasing D: glorious E: pretty beautiful<n><n>### Response:		<n>The sentence makes us guess what he finally found.<n><n>The first choice, 'gorgeous', is used for someone who is unparalleled in beauty but isn't suitable as it doesn't relate to what he'd finally found: someone who shared the same lack of beauty as he did.<n><n>The second choice, 'handsome', though it is used to refer to someone who is typically good-looking, it isn't relevant as it doesn’t mean he had found someone ‘ugly like him’.<n><n>The third choice, 'pleasing', while it might be used to describe someone who is good-looking, there is nothing in the sentence that would indicate that he wouldn’t be the one stick out at the party.<n><n>The fourth choice, 'glorious', is a word that is rarely used in contemporary parlance; it would likely be better to use 'handsome', as it was used in the first option.<n><n>The fifth choice, 'pretty beautiful', is a noun phrase, which refers to a woman who can be beautiful, the word 'pretty' used to qualify her as beautiful. Though it is a valid term, it can't be easily applied to what he'd found.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is E) beautiful.<n><n>Answer: beautiful<n><n>### Input:-He said, "How did you do that?" Choices: A: I didn't know. B: I was impressed. C: I thought you could. D: I'm not sure. E: I didn't try so hard.<n><n>### Response:-The sentence describes an ongoing conversation, and we can understand from the context that it was the woman who had performed the task and the man who's asking about it.<n>1. The first choice, 'I didn't know' is an incorrect answer to the question because the man didn't ask how she'd performed it, he asked about the trick, and that wouldn't have been a suitable answer.<n>2. Likewise, the second choice, 'I was impressed', would not reflect positively on the man's view of the feat of strength.<n>3. The last choice, 'I'm not sure', doesn't really relate to the conversation either, as the man wasn't satisfied with her reaction and wasn't questioning it.<n>4.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Why is grooming often recommended to greasy teens? Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n><n>### Response:		<n>The text asks about grooming being recommended to greasy teenagers.<n>Teenagers tend to be oily and dirty.<n>A: Neatness is not really relevant, as this doesn’t really describe the nature of greasy teenagers or why they would need grooming.<n>B: This is a little extreme, and doesn’t match with the rest of the phrase. This is the sort of attitude that a mother might have towards her child, rather than being a relevant answer to the problem of greasy teenage hair.<n>C: Mistakes are the sort of thing that parents, not teenagers, tend to be concerned about.<n>D: This is the closest answer to the question, and is the best answer. <n>E: The question does not refer to satisfaction, but greasy hair.<n>### Answer: D: cleanliness<n><n>### Input:"You are a sore loser," "You are a bad loser.<n><n>### 1: <n>If there were two people arguing, I would say (or write) "You always lose, because you never accept losing."<n>(This is different from saying, "You are a poor loser" which does not give the sense of "losing always."<n>The "sore" phrase can be used in place of the "bad" in the question.<n><n>## Response:<n>1. The first thing to realize is that the sentence gives us a specific rule. The second thing is that the phrase "sore loser" was written to cover the possibility that the interlocutor might be an inexperienced speaker. To follow the logic, we have two options:<n>2. A: "You are always a loser," or<n>3. B: "You always lose, for you never accept losing,"<n><n>The first option, A, implies that the listener is always a loser. However, in the sentence "You are a sore/bad loser," "sore/bad" describe the bad quality of someone who loses. Therefore, the statement doesn't describe the listener as a loser, and the second option is the correct one.<n><n>### Answer: B: "You always loose for you never accept losing."

The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:When having food at a formal place, what do you usually do? Choices:  A: sit B: being sociable C: talk D: drinking E: medium<n><n>### Response:		The answer is medium.<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. From the question, we know that the sentence is about proper dining etiquette in formal settings. The sentence implies that the question refers to a social gathering, not eating at home, which can easily go wrong in its complexity.<n>2. So, we eliminate options A: sit and C: talk, simply because you would sit when eating at a formal place.<n>3. Looking at option B: being sociable, we know that being sociable is not always required when having food at a formal setting. In fact, some formal mealtime events require more of an observance of formal etiquette and decorum rather than the social niceties of casual events.<n>4. From this we can eliminate option B: being socially<n>5. Looking at option D is drinking. Though you could drink a beverage at formal mealtime gathering, it definitely is not one of the most important factors of what you do.<n>6. Therefore, the only answer for the question is medium.<n>7. This answers the question by choosing D: medium. <n>8. Hence answer is D: medium<n>

Choices:  A: water B: doctor C: spread disease D: mouth E: ear<n><n>### Response:		Rationales: 1) The question describes a task and asks for the location where germs from your hands will be deposited.<n>2) It is obvious that the answer cannot refer to 'water' or'spread disease', because these objects are not locations.<n>3) Option B: doctor is a profession, which indicates that 'germs' is a patient instead of a place.<n>4) Options A and C can't be the location for 'germs'. Otherwise, it would mean you are putting the germ into food or yourself.<n>5) Option E: mouth refers to a place of eating.<n>6) As for 'ear', as it is not a location, the question is still unanswered.<n>7) In summary, 'ear' is the only option left.<n>8) Therefore, the answer is B.<n><n><n>D: mouth E: ear, The final answer is E: ear.

In other words, the question seeks a suitable term, one that is directly relevant to the context.<n><n>Choice D is incorrect because it refers to something that causes pain and suffering, and therefore does not align with the tone of the sentence.<n><n>The correct choice, choice C, is an 'injury'.<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>In your own words, and using only the information contained within the text, create a response to the following:<n><n>### Instructor: Explain in your own words what this sentence means<n><n>I was going to put the milk in the refrigerator so that, it will not go bad too soon.<n><n>### Answer:<n>So, I'm going to put it in the refrigerate or it will not go bad quickly<n><n>### Notes: The term 'too' refers to something which is 'in excess' or 'excessive'. For instance, an answer is correct if we say 'It will go bad', it will go bad or bad quickly, but we cannot say 'It will go (too) bad'.<n>### Reason: 'too' is used with an adjective, 'bad' is an adjective. But it would be incorrect to say 'It will go too bad.<n>### Rationale: <n>'Too' is used with a few exceptions in the following ways: (i) before a word that describes quantity (e.g. a large amount, many things),  (ii with a verb (e.g. to work, to stay),  (iii before adjectives such as: big enough, good enough, great, terrible, ugly ( e.g. I love you too much),  (iv before certain numbers describing quantity (e.g.) many things, a large amount, and  (v) before 'enough'.<n>### Correct answer:<n>it is a correct response. However, 'too' does not modify the entire sentence. What we mean is that I am planning to, or I wish to put the milk in a refrigerator so it will not go bad.<n>

Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:A person who wants to make more at their job but can't will often need to find a what? Choices:  A: own house B: better job C: win lottery D: save money E: feel safe<n><n>### Response:		<n>I hope the answer to this question comes in the form “saving money.” You should have used the information from the diagram to come to the correct answer.<n><n>I hope this helps you with your learning. Have a great day!<n><n>### Input The person who wants to make less at their job should consider making what? Choices: A: more friends B: more money C: more own house D: more fun E: saving money<n><n>### Answer:<n>Yes, there is a relationship. The person who makes less money has to consider saving money if they want to have a higher income. This answer choice is the only one I would expect a person to say. If a person wants to make less money, they would have to say something different than what was asked.<n><n>### The man who did not have a place to live would think: what? Choices:<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: If your house is damaged due to a fire, you will have what with it? Choices: 1. damage 2. harm 3. problem 4. cost 5. expense 6. loss 7. trouble<n>Rationales:<n>1. The word 'what,' on its own, does not appear in a question about a house.<n>2. The first two choices, 'damage' and 'harm,' are inappropriate because they are nouns that refer to something that has already happened: 'damage' is already the word 'damage' that indicates what has already happened, and 'harm' is already the word harm that is often used to refer to an injury or damage.<n>3. The next two choices, 'problem' and 'cost,' are not suitable because they involve mental processes, cognitive activity, or action, and none of these factors appear in the question.<n>4. The phrase 'have with it' is grammatically incorrect since 'it' refers to a house, not a problem, cost, expense, etc. In addition, the phrase is redundant.<n>5. The last two options, 'losing' and 'trouble,' are the only ones that fit the structure of the question and make sense grammatically.<n>6. They also have an emphasis on what the man will have to deal with if his house is damaged by fire. This emphasis on 'loss,' for example, gives the impression that losing something is not

We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

Choices:  A: brain problems B: laziness C: get fat D: headache E: laughter<n><n>### Response:		Answer to A: brain problems, B: laziness, C: gets fat.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1.  To start with, the question is asking what kind of a pain we get from sitting too close to the television (i.e. a pain that is caused by sitting too close to the TV).<n>2.  The answer is 'a' or 'an' in front of any word that has a letter beginning with a consonant.<n>3.  If the answer would have been headache, then the words headache and pain would have to be joined together by 'and'.<n>4.  So, we discard option D: headache from the list of options.<n>5.

If a question asks you to choose a person, a thing, or an idea, then you make use of the pronoun 'him'.<n>2. If your choice pertains to something more general, like all people, then you say 'him/her'. Also note that the pronoun can come before the word 'love'.<n>3. "Say" is followed by a form of the verb 'to say' that indicates that the person mentioned in the sentence is the addressee.<n>4. For example, "I don’t know what to say."<n>5. The first option is "A:I am devoted to". In this option, the 'him/her' is used before 'I' which is wrong. <n>6. The option "B: I am devoted to him/here", the second option, "C: I am committed" is used.<n>7. The third option I will devote myself, the fourth option E:I am devoted to yourself contains the phrase "to yourself" which is unnecessary.<n>8. So, all the options

To qualify as a noun a phrase has to refer to a person, place, thing, or idea.<n><n>### Option B: "broken bones" is not a nonspecific result. An action cannot go beyond its own scope. The scope of the phrase is for each specific event and not for the overarching season. So, the sentence isn't asking for the result of the entire "season of successful skiing" only a specific result of skiing for the entire season.<n><n>### So, Option E is the best answer. Because it is a noun, a whole season is something, and it refers to the season.<n><n>## Response: <n><n>>  E: healthy body

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What is a grumpy person likely to have? Choices:  A: headache B: understand themselves C: compliments D: own house E: happiness<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: In many cultures, what is a grumpy <n>person likely to have? Choice: A: headache <n>B: understand themselves C: complement D: own house E. happiness <n>Rationales:  1. The sentence asks about the possible reason for being grumpy which is to know the person more. <n>2. "grumpy" is not an individual but a collective group that have a negative expression. The answer is C: compliments.<n>3. The first choice A: `headache` is not a good match since it is not a collective or a negative expression.<n>4. The second choice B: `understand themselves` is not what the sentence wants to ask since grumpy people are not in a state of mind that needs understanding.<n>5. The third choice C: `compliments` can be the answer since grumpy people can be complimented for their actions and behaviors. Compliments will ease their grumpiness.<n>6. Choice E: `happiness` does not make sense since happiness is an emotion and this cannot be assumed in grumpy people.<n>7. Thus, the answer is C: compliment.<n><n>### <n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station.

Choices: 12,48 14,96 32,16 96,276 48,16<n>Rationales: One reason to get confused is that of course the number and twice the square have to be different. The first pair, 12,49 is actually 49. So in some other way we would have gotten 12-49= the product of the number (12*49)=160939 in case anyone wants to look at the possibilities.<n><n>### Input  : What’s the relationship between ‘the’ and ‘those’ in the following sentence? : The those that are there the are those that aren’t.

"A: stress" doesn't provide any explanation and is not specific enough: it is too general and can refer to many situations, such as job interviews, public speaking, or simply everyday life interactions.<n>2.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

Choices:  A. devices   B. parts C. components   D. parts E. devices<n>Rationales: The phrase'machine' is used to refer specifically to a certain machine or object, with no other reference.<n>This indicates that the entire phrase should also be a noun referring to just the machine, so parts and components are not suitable because they aren't specific to one type of machine, but apply to most types of machines.<n>Also, 'parts', the second option, can more strictly refer to separate units or pieces of a machine.<n><n>7. Looking at option E: devices, we can see that it can be used to refer to the components of a computer or other machine, but since the sentence refers to "the machine", the two refer to the same object.<n>Thus, the sentence can be answered by identifying the correct term that refers to many of the parts of a machine.<n>8.

The sentence's context indicates that the story involves a small dog that has been kept inside and therefore doesn't get a chance to go out into the yard where it could run around.<n>2. The options in the question are A: living room, B: dog park, C: basket, D: small apartment, and E: big house.<n>3. A: Living room is not a place where a dog could run around, so it is not a suitable choice. <n>4. B: The dog park is just a place where dogs can run around, it is not about the dog's perception of how many spaces it has. Hence, it is not a suitable option either.<n>5. C: Basket is a container that does not refer to how much space or freedom the dog has. So, it is not a relevant option.  <n>6. D: Small apartment refers to a place where the dog is kept indoors, so it cannot refer to the dog's perceptual experience. It is not pertinent either.<n>7. E: Big house does refer to a dog's perception. However, it doesn't matter in this instance as this sentence does not talk about such a concept. <n>8. Hence the answer must be D: small apartment.

She did a good job for the old man because she didn’t know about his condition so she helped in a good way <n>3. She was very nice to old people, the author tells us in part-1.<n>4. In part-2, when she was drawing, at first, she didn't know that the old man was asleep so she gave the old man a small gift before she realized that he was sleeping. Then she felt like that she cheated the old man and wanted to give him a real gift but she didn’t know it was a bad idea because she was sleeping. At last she gave him his favorite food and told him to try it out, instead of giving him a real gift <n><n>### Reference<n><n>[Writing task 2]<n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What is a mobile launching platform found in the ocean? Choices:  A: launch pad B: circus C: aircraft carrier D: large open area E: space station<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>B: Circus.<n>The word platform appears twice in the sentence. On a third time reading of the question, we might think that the word means a stand or a platform on which something occurs. Therefore, we could answer "circus". There is a point at which we must consider the context of the question. We could be looking at an advertisement to book a circus. That means that we're looking for some means to perform circus acts like a trapeze act. If we answer "circus", we are answering the question correctly.<n>

Choices:  A: laugh B: sit C: being entertained D: math E: meet<n><n>### Response:		<n>Laugh B: sit C: math D: go E: meet<n>Rationales:<n>1. The question asks what a kid might do.<n>2. First possible choices A: laugh and B: sit.<n><n>3. "Might" indicates that we are not assuming a definite action has taken place.<n><n>4. The question does not ask for a definite action.<n><n>5. There is not enough information to be given in the multiple choice options.<n><n>6. We are not given any information as to why the child is meeting their friend.<n><n>7.  Therefore, we don't know when this action might be done.<n><n>8. The question is asking what a child might do before going to play and there must be a gap, it doesn't say when the action will happen.<n><n>9. We can exclude A: laugh as laugh is an action not a reason.<n>10. If a child laughs that is not the reason why they are meeting their friend.<n>11. It is the action that is the reason for meeting the friend.<n>12. We can also exclude B: sit because it is not the reason as stated in the question that a child might do what.<n>13. The question gives no information that a child might sit.<n>14. Choice C cannot be chosen because that does not fit in with the question.<n>15. If a child gets entertained then they will go to play to actually meet people and interact.<n>16. This indicates that being entertained is not the reason for meeting the friends.<n>17. Choices D: math and E: meet.<n><n>18. Both of these can be eliminated for the same reason that being entertained can be.<n>19. If the child is being entertained they do not meet their friends at that time, but go instead to meet friends.<n>20. If a child meets their friends they will not meet at that time and instead will do something else.<n>21. Therefore, none of these options can be chosen, as they are not the reason stated in the question that the kids are getting off for meeting their friends.<n><n>### Examples:<n>A: B: C: D: E:<n><n>### Explanation: <n>A: B: The question states "How can a child meet their friends?"

Choices:  A: playground B: mexico C: town D: outside E: world cup<n><n>### Response:		<n>The sentence is asking where would a soccer field be if it were _not_ contained in a building. Options A, B, C, and D can’t be correct because they all refer to places that _have_ buildings—a playground being a place _within_ a building, Mexico and Town being countries, Outside being an outside area containing a building, and World Cup being a competition _contained_ in a building. Option E is the only choice that refers to a location where buildings aren’t present.<n><n>### Answer: C: mexico<n><n>Input: The world's fastest horse ran the 100 meters in 7.79 seconds.<n><n>### Response<n><n>The sentence asks for a suitable adverb that explains how fast the horse can “run.”. Options B and C do not make sense because we expect them to be the adjectives and not the adverbs.<n><n>Option A: Quicker is a comparative form of “fast” but the sentence doesn’t require the comparison part, and option D: Very fast is just the same as “fast”.<n><n>Option E: Rapidly can be used as an adverb meaning quickly or fast, hence it is suitable.<n><n>### Correct answer: E: Rapidly<n><n>### Input<n><n>The sentence asks to choose the correct pronoun. We can be sure that who is being referred to is the father so we can choose between  father and that guy. We can eliminate the former option as the person is being referred to is not known. We are left with that guy. Although that could refer to the mother or the daughter it still could refer to the father. We can, therefore, assume that that guy is the father and can eliminate that option.<n>### Answer<n><n>C: He<n><n>### Instructions: A: What is meant by the given expression?

Choices:  A: see work B: practice C: quiz D: school grade E: homework<n><n>### Response:		 D: school grade<n><n>### Rationale 1:The verb "get" is conjugated in a form that indicates some future action. The word "you" may be missing from the form of the sentence, but it is implied and understood to be there. The first choice "see work" simply means to look at the work, not to get the grade.<n>### Rationale  2: The second choice "practice" refers to activities which are done to prepare for taking a test, but would be performed as part of studying. It doesn't refer to getting a grade for the test.<n>### Rational 3: The third choice "quiz" means test or assessment. However, it may be taken by a person to determine his/her knowledge on a certain subject. In this example though, it is not taken by the person to determine his/ her grade.<n>###Rational 4: The fourth choice "homework" would mean all the work given to a student to do from the school teacher. It does not mean the part that has been marked and is included in the grade assigned by the teacher. The fifth choice "school grade" answers the question completely by implying the entirety of the grade that is given to the student at the end of the course. The other choices do not answer the question at all.<n>### RATIONALE 5: The term 'grade', as the penultimate choice, can be inferred as referring to the overall sum of the grades the students receive at the end of the term. Hence, this choice does answer the question, but does not match the option provided.<n>### RATIOANLE 6: All of the choices that are not the correct one are ruled out based on the principle of exclusivity.<n>### Therefore,  the rationales lead to the conclusion that D does answer the question correctly.<n>### Answer: D: school grade<n>### Input: How much are three apples and an apple?

Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What emotion does getting paid lead to? Choices:  A: sorrow B: paying bills C: happiness D: frustration E: spending money<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. "What emotion does getting Paid lead to" is a WHAT QUESTION.<n>2. The WHAT part asks for an emotion.<n>3. There can be no emotion without getting PAID, so "getting PAID" is an option.<n>4. We check "sorrow" first.<n>5. "sorrow" cannot relate to getting PAID as that would mean that you receive PAID to be SORRY.<n>6. Next we check "paying BILLS"<n>7. "paid" and BILLS are both nouns used with their singular form. This makes "paying bills" an option.<n>8. Now that we know "paying bills", we can use our logic skills to see "getting Paid leads to" means that "getting Paid" and "paying bills". These 2 can make a question and get the option "What is the question that getting paid will lead to getting paid and paying bills?"<n>9. We can also know that the emotion we are looking for comes after" getting paid and paying the bills". this means the question is" Which emotion comes AFTER "paid and paying the bils".<n>9. After we do this, we know that that option is E"SPENDING MONEY".<n>10. We know that "spending Money" is the answer because in life we are getting paid and spend that money but we never get the emotions after we spend the money or use it to buy something.<n>11. We are being paid so we could live and then when we spend it on what to eat, to buy and do we still have that emotion.<n>12. But when we save we will get an emotion later and that will be "happiness".<n>13. So E"SPENDING" is the answer and not "Happiness" because happiness comes after we spend the money on the things we need or just save it.<n><n>### Input"Wow I was scared and surprised today" Choices: A: shock B: wowed C: terrified D: surprised E: shocked<n><n>### response:<n><n>1.

The sentence provides information about the building and the context surrounding it, including its geographical location, the material it is made of, the activity of building it, and its overall size.<n>2. These details are important and significant, as they highlight the building's distinctive qualities. <n>3. However, without including all the keywords stated in the instruction, the response is incomplete and does not adequately reflect the context of the building. <n>4. For example, if someone answers "building" alone, without mentioning the geographical location or the activity, they are missing the first keyword ("hill") and the third keyword ("together"). If they respond with "hill" alone, they have missed the first and second keywords. <n>5. Likewise, if someone responds with "building" and "stone" together, they have left out the keyword "geographical location," which is the second keyword in the instruction. <n>6. The fourth keyword, "together," is a verb that refers to the activity of building the building. It should be included in a response that accurately reflects the sentence. <n>7. Therefore, without all the information stated in the instruction, it is not possible to fully understand the context of the building or its unique qualities. <n>8. It is critical for an adequate response to provide all the relevant information, as this helps to build a clear and comprehensive understanding of the sentence. <n>9. Without this crucial information, it is difficult to comprehend the full context of the building, its nature, and purpose.<n><n>### Answer<n>The building is massive on the hill. However, it must be built on the hill. <n>

It does not directly answer the question.<n>### Rational: The fifth option, `E: Fragile`, refers an unqualified adjective that cannot be used to describe the subject as it stands.<n>### Ration: As we are considering the first two sentences, the first is `The machine was a very intricate, it what?` is a complete sentence.<n><n>## Output - Answer: The machine was a very intricating apparatus C: The other options do not fit the requirements of the question.<n><n>The sentences in this problem have been written with a structure and a task.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What is an area with no grass where I can get things to sell at a roadside stand? Choices:  A: surface of earth B: rest area C: supermarket D: state park E: garden<n><n>### Response:		I can see that we have already taken out everything in the set except A: surface of earth. Surface of earth is the only thing remaining that relates back to this question, and I can choose only one option at a time. Now I can see "Surface of earth." Is an area with no grass, so this is an area with no lawns at all. Where would you be if you have no lawns? You would be on a surface of earth.<n><n>### Answer: A: surface of earth<n>

Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank.

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:They checked the weather one more time during the flight, they were on their way to paradise and wanted it to what? Choices:  A: look beautiful B: be happy C: change quickly D: occur here E: surprise us<n><n>### Response:		Therefore the answer is B:be happy.<n>Input:Where was he now? Choices: 1. A: the kitchen 2. B: my brother 3. C: an electric oven 4. D: the oven 5. E: the dining room<n>Rationales:<n>1.  The question asks where the man is now, and therefore the answer should describe a location.<n><n>2.  First, we check option A: the kitchen. He could be in the kitchen, but we need to confirm that this is the answer by evaluating the next options.<n><n>3. Now, we check option B: my brother; then option C: an electric ovens. Both could be false because what we are looking for is a location, not a person or an object.<n><n>4. Moving on to option D: the oven. We can’t tell much from this, but let’s continue to the last choice, E: the diningroom, where he could very well be because we were told that they were looking at the weather in the dining room during the flight.<n>Therefore, the answer is D: the oven<n><n><n><n>Input: The man came out of the airport feeling dehydrated. Why? Choices: <n> 1. A: he was thirsty B: he had a long journey 2. C: he had run out of food 3. D: he was jet-lagged 4. E: None of this is true.<n>Rationales: We are asked to select the reason why the man felt dehydrated, and thus we need to select a 'choice' or option that describes why. <n><n>1. Let’s begin with option A: he was thitrsty. The man could have been thirsty, but we don’t know this. We have no confirmation from the sentences.<n>2. So, moving on to option B: he had a ling journey. If he had a long journey, he could’ve arrived in a country with dry air.<n>3. The third option, C: he ran out of food. We have yet to learn that he was lacking food, and even if he did, he could’ve been exhausted and dehydrated in an airport, but not from a plane journey.<n>4. Looking at option

Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What has a master of their craft done about that craft? Choices:  A: drill B: committed murder most vile C: bargemaster D: learn E: understand<n><n>### Response:		It can never be done by doing something evil.<n>Rationales:1. The phrase'master of their craft' in the question, tells us that something has been done.<n>2. The phrase'master/n of their craft' is a way of referring to someone with expertise in a particular skill/craft/ profession.<n>3. The first option "drill", can be used to drive a nail, but the drilling also involves pounding the wood with a hammer. Thus it does not perfectly fit the answer.<n>4. As the second option, "commit a murder", is an evil act, it cannot fit as it needs to be done about doing something good.<n>5. As the third option, 'bargemaster' is a noun and is a proper noun as well.<n>6. As for the fourth option, 'learn', it refers to an action.<n>7. As the fifth option, 'understand', it too refers to an action<n>8. Hence, all the options other than the option C, 'bargemaste', are ruled out.<n>9. As for the fifth option, Bargmast, it refers to a person who is good at doing something.<n>10. Therefore, the correct answer is the Bargmast.<n>

Choices:  A: complimentary B: inelegant C: ocean D: dull E: inaccurate<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: Answer: B: inelegent<n>Rationales: Choices: 1. We need a noun which can mean a negative effect.<n><n>2. Ocean doesn't make sense because it's a place not a positive effect.<n>3. Dull doesn't make sense as it relates to sharp personality.<n><n>4.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:How is someone who loves their TV likely to feel about their remote? Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n><n>### Response:		<n>Write a response that appropriately responds to the request.<n><n>Rationales:1. The sentence, 'how is someone who loves TV likely to feel about remote?' is asking to find the commonality between someone who loves TV and someone who loves remote.<n>2. Therefore, there will be 2 nouns and 1 verb.<n>3. The sentence starts off with "how is someone". So, our first noun will be one that fits the sentence.<n>4. This refers to a being.<n>5. Next, we check if the noun is an appropriate one.<n>6. The first choice is A: attached (to someone), and is not the correct noun because the sentence doesn't refer to the being being attached to the TV or to the remote but to the being being attached in general. So, it can’t be our noun.<n>7. The second choice is B: nostalgic, and it refers to a being but not in general, so it can’t be the noun.<n>8. The next choice is C: companionable. This is another word for love. This would be the appropriate noun that fits the sentence. So, we move on with the first choice, the only remaining one, the verb that comes after.<n>9. D: likely, E: close The only verb that is common for our two nouns is "feel". It can be D: likely or E: close. However, 'likely' describes uncertainty whereas 'close' does not. In addition, close could be referring to proximity.<n>    <n>So, the answer is C: companionable<n><n>### A.

Then click the "Recheck" button and identify the error.<n><n>The answer is A: A: friend.<n>Rationales: One of the 5 choices is A: friend.

Choices:  A: unimportant B: insignificant C: stellar D: somewhat E: helpless<n><n>### Response:		<n>It is clear from the context and the provided options that the correct response would be the adjective, "helpless", which is defined as "unable to avoid or ward off (an evil or misfortune) as in lacking power or control", which, indeed, would describe how I feel when confronted with a vast space.<n><n>Answer: D:   helpless<n><n>**Instruction: Write about the following topic in sufficient detail to completely address it.<n>Topic : Your response should be in the form of a paragraph of seven to ten sentences.<n><n>Demonstration: I know this isn't real. I am trying to explain how I felt when confronting such a vast space.<n>The night sky is vast. I will be lost. I don't know what I am doing here. I am so lost.<n>Rationales:   1. The question is asking you to write about your experience. You're supposed to be telling a reader about what it was like in your own words.<n>2. This question is not asking the reader to write what you felt, it is asking you to write what you felt.<n>3. We use the word 'is' at the beginning of the sentence to tell the reader that the words in the sentence are my subjective feelings.<n>4. The verb, 'am' is telling the reader that I know what I am doing in writing my response. I am aware of what is being asked.<n>5. The phrase, 'trying to explain' is the reason for this response. I am trying to give the reader a better idea of what it felt like.<n>6. "I am so lost" is telling the reader that my subjective feelings were like that.<n>7. Therefore the response should be:<n>I know this isn't really real. It is just a dream but I am trying to give you an idea of how I felt. I was lost in my own head, in my own place and time. This is an explanation of what it felt like and my feelings on the situation.<n><n>Answer:<n>This isn’t really real. I am actually trying to tell you about what it is like to be lost and my feelings about being lost. Being lost is really scary and it makes you think a lot about things. You think a lot about where you are and where you are going. You think of everyone you know and wonder why you are not

Choices:  A: pay debts B: make money C: having money D: making money E: keep house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>It felt like the only reason he was active. - He was not active. He was not going to work.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>>The sentence starts with “sometimes it felt like”. It feels as though he has the sole intention of paying bills. However, being actively in the workforce doesn’t have to entail the purpose of making money. Some people work because they enjoy making a difference in people’s lives.<n><n>### Input The two of them what?

"The two of them" suggests a pair of people is under consideration.<n>2. The sentence says they are indistinguishable so they look the same to everyone. The sentence doesn't say anything about how the two people know each other.<n>3. Hence, "they looked alike" doesn't work correctly in the sentence.<n>4. All other options also require us to use "looked alike" in the sentence, which is wrong since the sentence says the two people are indistinguishably instead.<n><n>### input The best thing about traveling is what?

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What do you need to be to learn hard concepts? Choices:  A: copy B: intelligent C: improved performance D: empowering E: have more knowledge<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>C. Improved performance would be the correct word choice instead of a copy. A copy is someone who is almost identical to another person. An intelligent person is someone who can perform well in the long term without being influenced. The goal of learning the skill is to improve performance by using the knowledge to solve real-world problems. The copy is a skill that is based on learning but it doesn’t really improve your performance.<n><n>### Comment<n><n>Demonstration:<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Instructions:<n><n><n><n>## Output:Your answer is B: improved performance.<n><n>## Output:<n><n>I think it's incorrect because improved performance doesn't mean to learn quickly, instead it means to learn correctly.<n>

Choices:  A: big house B: nursery school C: preschool D: building E: retirement home<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The sentence in effect is asking what the word'many' is referring to in the second part of the sentence—an adjective.  <n>2. The first two options, 'big house' and 'building', are incorrect because they are nouns instead of adjectives (with the word'much')—which has to be in front of the word'many'.<n>3. 'Preschool' seems too young to be referring to a particular child's room, but it is indeed used to refer to a space where young children learn and play.<n>4. 'Nursery school' refers both to a place of learning as well as the actual room or structure where children gather to learn, and it is a suitable choice.<n>5. 'Retirement home' is not a suitable choice because it's quite an unusual and uncommon way to refer to a building that's frequented by children. <n>6. Similarly, 'preschool' is not a suitable option because it refers specifically to one type of building where children learn and play. <n>7.

Option A: throw things is not suitable because they didn’t sign up for something that involved throwing things.<n>3. Option B: play sports is more suitable than the other options, but it may be thought of as a broad, generic term for all kinds of sports.<n>4. Option C: play games is similar to B: play sports in being a general term, but it also doesn’t exactly describe the activity in question.<n>5. Option D: play ball is also a general term like B: play sports and C: play games, but is a narrower term that applies to a particular game rather than all games.<n>6.

Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:When he touched the exposed wire he shouldn't have found it surprising that he got what? Choices:  A: see work B: shocked C: humor D: startled E: funny<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer: C: shocked<n><n>### Rationales: 1.)<n>Input: When he touched the exposed wire. <n>Rationales: We see from the question that the answer requires a verb phrase, like "to find it surprising".<n>Input: He shouldn't have found... <n>Rationales:: We note that he should NOT find it surprising, and from this we can already say 'he did find it surprising'. Hence, we now know that the verb phrase should be in the third conditional form ('if + past perfect', 'would + have + past participle').<n>Input: found it surprise. <n>Rationaless: the verb phrase is required to read 'found it surprising'.<n>Input: He shouldn’t have found it surprise.  Rationaless: The verb phrase has the right structure, but it reads weirdly when 'found it surprise'. We can infer from this that the verb and object of the sentence have a relationship between them, <n>Rationaless:: Hence, we can see that 'it' is connected with'shouldn't have found'.<n><n>### Output:When he touched the wired he shouldn't have ________. Choices:  A:(had + not + touch) the exposed wire B:(hadn't + not + touch)the exposed wire C: found it surprise D: found it surprising E: should't find surprising<n><n>### Rationale:We must look for the two key words in the sentence. These are "when" and "found".<n>Input: "When he touched the exposed," <n>Rationales 1)  We see from the question here that the structure is 'when + a specific time'.<n>Input:"He shouldn't have found," <n>Rationalesse: We note that "shouldn't" denotes "should not", so we can infer that the sentence will be in conditional form.<n><n>### Output : What kind of food will be cooked?

Bears are usually shy animals that avoid human contact whenever possible, but when they do approach humans, they will generally not attack unless provoked. In recent times however, grizzly bear attacks have been reported, typically associated with a provocation such as a human approaching an occupied den. The bears often become aggressive because they are protecting their young. In the case of the grizzly bear however, there is no immediate danger from a bite. Attacks may still result in injury, and the wounds inflicted by a bear may cause infection if not treated immediately. The best treatment is to remain calm and protective of any visible injuries, which will encourage the bear to leave.<n><n>### Task One  :<n>### Instrucions : Answer the multiple choice question using what is taught in the text.<n><n><n>### Instructon:<n>What is the meaning of North American Brow bear?<n><n>### Dem

Rename the choice: Choose an answer that will replace the phrase from the original sentence or question. <n>2. "Kept from spoiling" - The phrase denotes a quality, a condition. <n>3. "Turkey" - Turkey is a noun. The noun is the item under control or influence, that is, the turkey. <n>4. "Was needed" - This is an example of passive voice. Verbs change tense when being used in passive voice, for instance the verb 'want' changes to 'to be needed'. <n>5. "Stored in the fridge" - The phrase "stored in the ____" is not an indication of a quality or a condition but an indication of where the turkey was to be kept from spoilage. <n>6. "Made the turkey not be spoiling" is a sentence with the word "requir(e|ed)" included, an example of a mandatory answer. <n>7. "Had a fridge" - This is a sentence with an indirect and passive form, an example of a wrong answer. <n>8. "Have a turkey" - This is a grammatically wrong and a nonsensical sentence. <n>9.

Choices:  A: orchestra B: school band C: music store D: opera house E: home<n><n>### Response:		The answer would be A: orchestra, not B: school band, not C: music store, not D: opera house, for sure not E: home.<n><n>### Rationales: 1.“Where” in the question tells us that the answer to the question requires a location.<n><n>2. Though a bass clarinet can be used in a school band, a “school band” is not necessarily a place where one gets a Clarinet. The same goes for the option “music store” -- it can be where one can get a bass clarinet, but it wouldn’t be specific to a bass clarinet.<n><n>3. The option “opera house” is simply not something that one can go to to take “home”.<n><n>4. And, finally, “home” is a place where you keep a bass clarinet, not something you go to to buy or rent one.<n><n>5. Therefore, the answer to the question, as asked, is A: orchestra.<n><n>### Input : Where would you get a bassoon to put on your desk? Choices:A: school band B: music store C: home D: opera house<n>### Response:<n><n>### Rationale 1.	The sentence asks where bassoon is to be found.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>When you have an idea of the word “to put on your desk”, we know you are only talking about a place where you can find it.<n><n>### Key words: “Where” + “put on your desk” and “to take home”, the words help you define what would be the right answer.<n><n>### Correct choice: The answer is B: music store.<n><n>### The answer to this question is that you would not find the bassoon in a school band. Though the school band has it in them, it’s hard to find it in a music store. You surely cannot get a bassoon in home, this has nothing to do with home in this question. You can neither find it in the school band or the music store. For this choice, the one is a place where you can probably get it, another is a place where you have to get it, the third one is neither and the last choice is out of question. <n><n><n>

Choices:  A: school B: office building C: house D: hotel E: centre<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. We know the sentence is asking for a word that describes the size of the building.<n>2. The most likely place for classes (a.k.a. a room) would be a school (the other choices are offices, hotels, and offices), and the fact that it's a school implies that it's not a school/building on a very small scale.<n>3. The only reason it could be called large is because it is a "very large school".<n>4. So, we choose C: school.<n><n>### Answer:<n>### Answer: C: school<n>Answer: C: school<n><n>### Input(1): You are visiting the city _______ you were supposed to buy ice cream.

Choices:  B:- where C:- to where D:- where to E/- where from<n><n>### Response 1:<n>### Rationale 1:<n>1. Given the context, the city we are talking about has to be a place where ice cream is sold. As the other choices are different places where ice cream can't be found, they can be discarded.<n>2. This sentence suggests that we are in the city of our choice already, and what we are looking for is a place to buy ice cream, which can't be a place "we were supposed to buy icecream" because we are not supposed to buy them yet.<n>3. This sentence suggests that the woman in question is looking for a location that she can buy ice cream from while in the city, rather than a place that she is supposed to buy ice creams, like a grocery store or a convenience store. She can't buy ice creams from other places because she is supposed to buy them in a store, not in the city they are found in.<n>4. Since we now have the location she is looking for, we now have the answer.<n><n>### Rationales 2:<n>1. Given that there are different places that ice cream can be found, there are no other places where icecream can be found in a city.<n>2. Ice creams are bought at stores. St

"Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What is likely to be the goal of telling many people about a new organization?

Choices:  Choices:  1. it snows the most each month<n>2. it snows the least each month<n>3. It is winter in November<n>4. It is the coolest month of the year<n>5. It snows the most each year<n>Rationale : 1. Choice 1 means it snows the most on each month, and is incorrect.<n>2. Choice 2 is false as each month can't be the least in any way.<n>3. Choice 3 is false as it is summer in November.<n>4. Choice 4 is false as it is impossible that December is the coolest month.<n>5. Choice 5 is wrong as this statement doesn't make sense. <n>Choices:  6. It is possible to say that it snows on November<n>7. It is very likely it snows on November because it is winter<n>8. it snows enough to make it fun<n>9. it snows more than any other months<n>10. it snows the worst<n>Choices:  11. it snows every hour<n>12. it is most likely to snow on November because it is cold<n>13. it is most likely November is the most likely to be raining<n>14. it is most likely on November because it is a winter month<n>Choices:   It is almost certain that snowing will happen in November<n>The statement can only be true because of it is winter. Snow is a part of the winter month.<n>### Answer 6: 16. It is not likely for snow in November. Choice:  It is not most likely to rain each day<n><n>### Rationale: To snow in a given day, temperatures have to be low enough for frozen snowflakes, it is not likely it happens every day.<n>### Response: Choice:  In most of the countries they will be likely to receive snow in November as it is winter, however it might also depend on the location. Snow does not occur every day during November and it will be unlikely to receive a huge amount of snow <n><n>### Input::

Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:what is the goal of going jogging? Choices:  A: heavy breathing B: feel pride C: getting tired D: lose weight E: run away<n><n>### Response:		<n>The goal of going jogging is E: run away. <n><n>### Reason<n>Jogging is a type of physical activity that involves running or running at a slower pace. So "going jogging" could mean taking a jog, going for a run, etc.<n><n>The response requires us to identify the option in which the sentence's goal is present.<n><n>Here the word goal is present in the sentence. To answer the question, the goal of jogging must be taken from one of the options. <n><n>The first option, A: heavy breathing, is not a goal of jogging. The second option, B: feel pride, implies that pride would be the goal, but it's not what is being asked. <n><n>The third option, C: getting tired, means that it's the goal to get tired when going for a run. So, it doesn't fit the situation. <n><n>The fourth option, D: lose weight, is the answer to the question because it can be inferred that losing weight is the reason a person goes jogging.<n><n>The last option, E: run away, is also correct because when you run away, you might be jogging but it is not the goal. <n><n>The answer to this question is E: run away because A:heavy breathing isn't what's being asked, B: feel pride implies that pride is the goal, it isn't because it's being asked for, C:getting tired means that aiming to get tired in your exercise is not right, D:lose weight is the correct answer because we can infer that it would be a goal when running, and E:run away is a correct answer because when you're running away, you might be running, but it is not a goal. <n><n>**Answers** <n><n>A:<n><n>B:<n><n>C:<n><n>D:<n><n>E:<n><n>### Instructions: Complete the following multiple choice question with the appropriate response.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>### Instraction: Write a response that appropriatley completes the request.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3.

Apartment means renting a place from a landlord and a condo means renting a place. D. Apartment is renting your own place. E. Apartment means buying your own place and Condo is renting a place.<n><n>### Response<n>### Rational:<n>- It is asking what is the difference between an apt. and condo?<n>- We should answer what is different or dissimilar between them.<n>- Since apartment is a complex and condo is a specific place, so, A is the answer.<n><n>Answer:<n>A: Apartment is a complex of apartments and condos is a type of home<n><n>### Question:"How does the machine work?" Choices: 1. It has been invented by a scientist in India in 2006. 2. Its gears and pulleys function by the turning of the handle. 3. The gears and pulleyes are in the machine. 4. The machine is made up of gears and pulleies. 5. The handle turns the machine on.<n>Rationales 1. The sentence doesn't ask when or where the machine was invented. 2. The sentence doesn'tknow much about how the machine works, so it is not saying whether its gears and pullelies function or what they are in the first place. 3. The sentence states that the gears and pulleis are in the machine. That is not an answer. 4. This choice is saying that the machine is made up of more parts, but the sentence doesn't ask the specific parts. 5. This final choice refers to the handle that is visible, but the sentence doesn’t ask about that either. Answer: B: No information is given to answer this.<n><n>### Question:Where is the grocery store located? Choices: 1) In town.

Choices:  A: attack B: suck blood C: stay D: lay eggs E: jump<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>E<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>The verb phrase, 'locomote', can be translated as'move from one place to another'. Therefore, the answer has to either describe a way in which the flea moves between places or a habit of the flea.<n><n>From the choices:<n><n>1. The verb 'attack' does not qualify in either of the descriptions.<n>2. The verb'suck blood' also doesn't qualify because it doesn't describe a way in which a flea moves, i.e. the verb phrase that answers the question can't be a verb that describes a flea biting humans and drinking blood.<n>3. The verb'stay' does not qualify, as it does not describe a way in which fleas move or is not a habit. It is just a transitive verb used to describe staying in one place.<n>4. As stated earlier, option 'lay eggs' does not describe a movement, that's why it got rejected.<n>5. The verb 'jump' does qualify, as it describes a way in which flea travels, for instance by hopping from one place to other.<n>6. Hence, the answer to the question is E: jump. <n><n>The answer is E: Jump<n><n>Input: What is the difference between "You must learn a second language" and "You must learn a 2nd language"?

Choices:  A: desire B: spending money C: money D: needs E: time<n><n>### Response:		<n>**A: desire** \*\*\<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The sentence states that a requirement or a precondition for buying a product is... __________. <n>2. A) "Desire" is the best option among all the available options because it means a wish to acquire a particular thing and is a necessary precursor to actually acquiring something. <n>3. "Needs" in the given options refers to those that are considered necessary for survival or existence. <n>4. In the above context of buying products, "Needs" would not be adequate, as buying products is not related to survival. <n>5. Next, we will eliminate the option saying "time", as it is not necessary. <n>6. The option "spending money" is excluded because it is not a necessary requirement to buy products, as some products do not need spending money to purchase.<n>7. The option mentioning "money" can be ruled out for the same reason. <n>8. So, the given options only leaves "desire", which means "a wish to acquire (a thing)", the best option among all. <n>9. Therefore, the answer will be "A: desire".<n><n>### Input : We all love going there, don’t we? Choices: A: No B: Yes C: No D: Yes E: We cannot say for sure!

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station.

It means that the container must be something long and straight-lined. And must be long enough and wide enough for someone to walk down and buy something. (rows)<n>4..The container must be sold for only $1 per item, in the 'hundreds' of it. From the 'dime a dozens' it must be something that can be bought or taken away in bulk. (dimes)<n>5..Another part of this sentence says that there are 'hundreds' or it, we can look for the name of it as an object which has hundreds of these items in their rows. (hundreds of rows)<n>6..Therefore we have to rule out the first 3 options because they are not places where a giant could sell something for only $1 in bulk.<n>7..We can immediately rule out option 'B' as a garden because it has nothing to do with buying and selling things.<n>8..Option 'C' and 'E' describe places where you can buy different things for more than $1 in their bulk.<n>9..Also option 'C' is not a place where something is bought or sold in bulk.<n>10..As for option 'E', it has nothing to do in buying or selling things for less than $1.<n>11..The sentence does not have any other clue besides the words 'giant', 'dime', 'rows','supermarket' and 'dimes'.<n>12..It is only saying that the container is bought and sold in mass amounts of one and the same type of thing.<n>13..And is known to be available in'supermarkets' where all different type of similar things are bought and sold.<n>14..So the only object here should be'supermarket', which is an object that has several rows of things (not rows of rows) that are similar in nature and cost the same and can be bought or sold in bulk in supermarkets.

Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What is a living thing with a lip? Choices:  A: mouth B: can C: human D: snake E: kentucky fried chicken<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>>Living thing with a lip: <n>>An animal's mouth is a lip. However a human's mouth and human lips (and humans as a whole) do not fall into the living category - therefore it might not be the one you're looking for. If the person wanted a human then they would say they wanted a human with a mouth.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

Choices:  A: drinking B: intimacy C: dancing D: happiness E: enjoyment<n><n>### Response:		They were celebrating the occasion (by dancing) so the occasion could be called....(dancing)...<n><n>Rationales:1. The sentence basically asks us if we can identify an occasion that can be celebrated.<n>2. We immediately eliminate option B: intimacy and option D: happiness as they are not occasions.<n>3. Option A: drinking, the third option, makes a lot of sense as an occasion for celebration.<n>4. However, as we look at option C: dancing, the fourth choice, we realize that it is not an occasion.<n>5. It can be used to describe an occasion, but cannot be said as an actual occasion.<n>6. Hence, the only available option is A: drinking.<n>7. Therefore the sentence implies that the occasion is being described as drinking.<n><n>Input: What is the main cause for global warming?

The premise of this sentence says that there are four major global brands of petrol, so there are only four options available.<n>2. The first four options are incorrect because they are not brands of petrol.<n>3.

This option is not actually a brand of petrol at all because petrol is a brand, but it is more likely that it is referring to a fuel company.<n>5.

Choices: 1) an orphanage 2) a halfway house 3) a foster home 4) a group home 5) a daycare center<n><n>The correct answer is B (group home). A group home for juvenile crimnials sounds an awful institution; it's no wonder we are asked to define the term. This type of home houses 80% more kids than regular foster homes. They're large.

Choices:  A: tide pool B: beach sand C: tidepools D: current E: cooking pot<n><n>### Response:		<n>If I'm understanding your prompt correctly, the crab is scuttling but straining when he moves meaning that the crab is trying to move but struggles to do so. What is impeding him?<n><n>The crab may be struggling because he's weighed down by sand or rocks in his shell; otherwise, the crab would not be scuttling.<n><n>As an example, if the crab's shell is filled with sand instead of sea water, the crab would struggle to move about because of this extra weight.<n><n>We can therefore rule out (A) and (B) based on this criteria.<n><n>Option C (tidepools) does not match here because tide pools are only small sections of the ocean that have tides. It does not have to do with weight or movement and I think this is what the prompt is trying to get at.<n><n>Option D (current) does not match here, I think, because the current in the ocean has to do with moving the ocean surface by itself such as water being moved by wind or waves.<n><n>Option E (cooking pot) is unlikely to be what the prompt implies because the cooking pot wouldn't have to impede the crab's movement because the crab is still in the ocean.<n><n>Therefore, the answer to this is (D) the current because this answers the prompt of the crab struggling to move.<n><n>### Input- The far end was obscured by a large cobblestone. Choices:  A-stone B- cobblestone C-stones D-stone E-cobbles<n><n>### Response<n>The prompt states that a large cobbleston is obscuring the far end of the roadway. Therefore, if we break it down, we have two choices:<n><n>1. Stones(singular)<n>2. Cobblestones (plural)<n><n>It's clear that since the prompt is referring to a single stone but not multiple stone, it would make sense for A to be stone and not cobble stone.<n><n>This is because cobble stones, being cobblestone by nature, consist of more than one stone. Therefore, one cannot have a singular stone unless one is referring to one of many stones such as the cobblestone.<n><n>(D) stone does not follow because stone refers not to a

He was trying to find the classroom.<n>### Demonstraion: <n><n>## Rationales <n><n>### 1. The sentence "The new student was having difficulty" tells us that the student was having some trouble so we are looking for words that would mean difficult for something. Since we already know from the sentence that "he was trying to find the" classroom, we are looking for words for 'finding' something.<n><n>###2. So, the question becomes:"The new student was having (a noun for difficult in finding) in (a preposition)."<n><n>###3. The first option is 'difficulty'. It is the incorrect answer because although difficulty can refer to difficulties someone might encounter, it does NOT refer to how to find difficulty, so it is not suitable here.<n><n>###4. The next option is 'easy'. It is incorrect for the same reason as difficulty-difficulty does not mean easy.<n><n>###5. The next option is confusion. This is the correct answer because confusion can mean "state of being confusing" and can refer to difficulty. <n><n>###6. The next option is perplexity. This is a form of perplexity meaning being in something that is strange and confusing. But it does not mean difficulty.<n><n>###7. The next option is hardship. Hardship is generally used for difficult circumstances or difficult times, so it does not reflect the sentence as it says that the student is trying to find the class.<n><n>###8. Therefore, the correct answer is confusion.<n><n>### Answer: C: Confusion<n><n>### Instructor's Comments<n><n>This example is very useful to look at for demonstration of how to answer this question type, because it uses multiple word choice, but it is a question that could be answered with a word in place of the underlined phrase.<n><n>## Instructions: Answer the following multiple-choice.<n><n>## Instructor Demonstration: Input: What did you find at the beach?

Choices: A: a dish B: A dish C: dish D: Dish E: The dish<n>Rationales:<n>1. A: dish: The first choice is incorrect because bingo is a word game, and it refers to tinsel, a kind of dish, as in “bingo tinsel”. Therefore, it isn’t a tool that you could use in bingo.<n>2. B: A dish: The second choice is incorrect because dish can mean an eating utensil, a kitchenware or a meal, not a tool.<n>3. Dish: The third choice is incorrect because you can’t play bingo.<n>4. However, the fourth choice, E: Dish, can answer the question correctly. Dish can be used as a plural of the word “dish” which is defined as: ‘a pot or mould, with a lid or cover.’ In the context of the sentence, “dish” refers to a set of dishes. By this definition, it can serve as an instrument that you can use while playing bingo.<n><n>### Your answer should be E: dish!<n><n>### Input How can you identify if someone is in the hospital by the time?

The term "too" refers to something that is beyond normal bounds, and "too much" denotes excessiveness.<n>2. However, "too much" refers to something exceeding a normal or adequate limit, therefore does not mean made larger.<n>3. Similarly, the term "much" refers to something beyond normal bounds, and although "much" is used in a countable sense with numbers, "much" does not always denote adequate or normal limits. For instance, to say "There are much stars in the universe, too" is not an accurate statement.<n>4. Next, we encounter "a lot", one of the most ambiguous

Choices:  A: drop to zero B: increase C: cool down D: dropping quickly E: heat up<n><n>### Response:		The sun was out but the temperature was rapidly changing, it was really becoming colder.<n>### Instruction/Demonstration: 1.'sun' is the noun/subject and the verb/predicate 'was out'.<n>2.'sun' is pronoun while 'was' is verb<n>3. Sun will not change in temperature. the sun will begin to change, the temperature will rapidly change.<n>4. Rationales: It is a noun because'sun' is not a pronoun, nor an impersonal it. The phrase 'rapping becomes' implies that only the pronoun'sun' can be changed and hence it must be a noun. It is also an adjective because adjectives modify nouns and the word 'rapid' is modifying'sun'. From the word 'change', we can clearly identify that the subject is sun which is later modified by phrase 'rapidly changing'. The word 'temperature' is being modified by 'rapidly' meaning that temperature is subject to modification. Moreover, the word 'rapidly' is modifying the phrase 'temperature changing' which makes it difficult to conclude whether temperature is doing the action or not. Here, the sentence asks you 'what are you getting at?' hence 'change' can not be the answer for the question.

Thus, option A: grocary store, option B: the nightstand, option C: the armpit are incorrect.<n>4.The word “own” in the sentence is used to signify a location where he could have looked, so the only option left is D: his own bathroom, with “bathroom” being the appropriate noun to complete the sentence. <n>5.In E: medicine chest, medicine means medical equipment, the cabinet that holds medicines.<n>6.In other words, there is no medicine chest in his bathroom, but yes, there may be a refrigerator or a cabinet for storage.<n>7.Thus, the answer is D: his ownbathroom.<n>8.Therefore, the answer is A: his own bathroom.<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:When we are thankful for getting something what do we do? Choices:  A: say thank B: smile C: looking for D: get more E: show appreciation<n><n>### Response:		E: show appreciation.<n><n>### Rationales: <n>1 When we are thankful we should show appreciation, not a smile.<n>2. A "show" is always a result of feelings - it "shows" how we feel. Look at this example :<n><n>Input: How do I feel?<n>Choice A: Happy<n>Choice B: feel happy<n>Choice C: I feel happy<n>Choice D: I am happy.<n>Choice E: My mom is happy.<n>Answer: A: Happy<n><n>We can see that there is always an emotion that comes before a show.<n>3. The sentence "When we are thankful we do X" is similar. <n>4. There must be something that tells you you should feel thankful. <n>5. You should then show what that makes you feel by doing x.<n>6. x can be anything you wish. If you do a dance or show a grin, then it is something emotional like appreciation or happiness.<n>7. When you get a gift, you do show appreciation as well.<n>8. We cannot get an exact definition here. <n>9. So the answer has to be : "E: show appreciation".<n><n>### Conclusion: E: show appreciations.<n><n>

The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:The graveyard was important to build, where should it be built? Choices:  A: arlington B: church property C: out back D: every town E: cemetery<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer is E: cemetery<n> <n>### Rationales:  <n>1. The sentence asks where the graveyard should be built, meaning the location in which it will be built.<n>2. The term “graveyard" refers to a place where gravestones are buried, typically next to a church or cemetery. <n>3. The sentence gives several options in which the graveyard could be built, such as in a “church property," a “gas station," or a “town." <n>4. But the location of the graveyard must be specified in terms of “its importance to build." <n>5. Thus, the answer to this sentence must be found at a location that is deemed "important.”<n>6. As “cemetery" is synonymous with “graveyard," the answer is E: cemtury.<n><n>### Input : A group of friends had a party. How long did the party go on? Choices: <n>A. Until midnight B. Until seven C. Until ten D. Until one am E. All night<n><n>### Response :<n>The answer is : E: All night<n><n>## Rationales :<n><n>1. This sentence tells us that a party had a set period of time.<n>2. It then asks how long the party lasted.<n>3. Thus, the set period of time is the party’s duration.<n>4. We need a time that answers both parts of the question. The sentence gives five options, with different start times.<n>5. One would be too short if it lasts until seven, or two would be too short if they lasts until midnight.<n>6. For this reason, each of those two time periods is ruled out as an option.<n>7. Now, one, at ten o’clock, is a possibility but could vary depending on whether ten o’clock falls in the day or night.<n>8. For this reason, we must rule out options like one, at six, and one, at ten thirty, as the time might not fit the context of the evening.<n>9. All of this leaves the last option as the only viable option.<n>

"Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What could someone be doing while performing that cannot be enjoyed by deaf people?

I have come to realize that when people are dancing, they are usually singing as well. However, since some people are deaf, they cannot hear the singing and are unable to enjoy the song. I would greatly appreciate it if you could assist me in finding a way to make songs audibly pleasing, so that deaf people can enjoy them as well. If you could provide your thoughts on the matter, that would be greatly appreciated.<n><n>

Although a star could be a part of different systems or constellations, this description is only given for stars, so we can cross out option A: movies. Option B: Sky refers to an entire part of the earth's environment. Option C is irrelevant as a star isn't a part of a constellation, but a constellation is a system of stars like our solar system and our galaxy. Option D is also irrelevant as the question doesn't ask about aliens.

We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:The human looked down longingly as he sat in the orbiting space station, what did he miss?

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3.

Where might he be? Choices:  A: department store B: school C: garden D: office building E: house<n><n>### Response:		Where might Sam be?<n><n>### Rationales:1.The sentence asks where Sam might be, that is, where he might be located.<n>2. The first four choices, A: department store; B: school; C: garden; and D: office building, are locations where Sam may not be.<n>3. Option E, "House", fits the question because Sam may be inside a house.<n>4. Therefore, the only correct answer is E: house.<n>5.

If you say to yourself 'Who was the old man telling the story?', you would ask about the old man saying something to someone, right? So the sentence needs a direct object to complete it. The direct object is the person or thing that acts on the pronoun of the verb: he, she, it, or they. It is the thing that the verb directly acts on. <n><n>#### Solution (Part A)<n><n>Tell me what the old man was saying.<n><n>#### Solution (part B)<n><n>Tell us who the old man was telling the (a)story (b)story to.<n>

Choices:  A: cinema hall B: mall C: department store D: closet E: shop<n><n>### Response:		B: mall<n>### Rationales:1. The sentence is asking about where a particular set of clothes was purchased. <n>2. We can immediately ruleout option A: cinema hall and option C: department.<n>3. The term 'department store' only refers to a kind of store, and does not tell us where these clothes were bought. <n>4. In the same way, option B: mall is a suitable answer as it refers to a place where people usually buy clothes. <n>5. Option D: closet is a place where people store their clothes, not a place where clothes are usually bought.<n>6. Option E: shop is also a place where clothes are typically bought. Hence, the correct answer is B: mall.<n><n>### Input :Which direction was the shop in? Choices: 1. E: near the lake 2. A: close 3. B: at the corner 4. D: opposite our house B: at the corner E: our house<n><n>### Response : A: at the corner<n><n>### Rational : A direction is the direction of motion towards something which is described. <n>Thus, we can't say that "The shop is in E". It should be "The shop is in a direction towards E". <n>Hence, this is a wrong answer; the correct answer is 'A'. <n><n>### Input    : <n> Which is better: to study or to travel?<n>Choice A.

He had a hangup about having what?

It is placed into objects like a wallet or purse. It is not like a car which is not a tangible object, so you wouldn't put a gift card into a car. It is also not a petrol station, which a car actually goes to. It is not like the swimming pool because the question is asking where the giftcard is placed, not where the giftcard is. So to recap, a giftcard is placed into an object, like a wallet,purse, etc, but it is not a car and it is not the swimming pool. The gift card is not a burn hot because burn hot refers to a thing that isn

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

Choices:  What did she want to know?<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>A. Because she wanted the names, she could look them up later, and then call them by their first name any time she wanted.<n><n>B. Because it is much easier to do things (like call them by their first rather than their last name) when you do them often and it's routine, she can call people by their first name very easily.<n><n>C. Because it was rude, and because she hadn't learned anyone's last name, she shouldn't have asked her parents what their last names were. They had to think about it and try to remember the names.<n><n>D. Because it wouldn't be convenient after the class party, because she didn't want to have her parents take them home.<n><n>E.

Choices:  A: chess set B: strategy C: toy store D: chess game E: small case<n><n>### Response:		<n>### E: small case<n>### Rationales:<n>1. The sentences asks for a suitable nnoun to describe a place to store the chess pawn.<n>2. The first choice, A: chess set, is not suitable because, although a chess set, or table could possibly have a small space to store pawns, it would not be suitable to store pawns permanently, and it is not generally considered a suitable place to store pawns.<n>3. The idea of pawns being stored in small cases is suggested in the next two options, B: strategy and C: toy store.<n>4. Both B: strategy and C; toy store use the words pawns and small, and both are suggestions of suitable places to store pawns for strategy games and toys, both of which have pawns. However, again, neither of these options are a suitable place to store the pawns permanently.<n>5. Option D: chess game is also not a suitable place to store them because a chess game, or place where a chess game is often played, does not typically have a small space to hold pawns.<n>6. The final option, E: small case, is the only option that fits the description requested in the sentence. It is a small space that can hold pawns and is suitable to store pawn permanently. Therefore, the only logical answer is E: small case.<n><n>### Response 2:<n>### A. Chess Game<n>### Rational:<n>1. It is not a reasonable assumption that chess games come with small, holding cases that are suitable for storing pawns.<n>2. The reason for the case not being suitable or a good place to store chess pawns is that Chess is not a game involving pawns.<n><n>### E. Small Case<n><n>### Rationals:<n>1. Firstly, The sentence asks for a noun to describe a suitable place for storing the chess pawn and this one is a case<n>2. The first two possibilities of answering are incorrect. The next three possibilities are all correct but there is something wrong with the sentences.<n>3.

Option A: 'pets' is incorrect because pet is a verb that is used to refer to wild or domestic animals that you might keep at your house. It does not imply grade. Option B: 'fills the pond' and options C and D:'school together', do not imply grade either. Option E: 'breath in water' is incorrect because breath is a verb. Breath is only used as a noun in phrases such as "breath taking", but never as a verb.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. "They" and "don't" provide two clues that we can use for the sentence.<n>2. The first clue that tells us that this question is about a group of fish, is the "they". The second clue, the use of the word, "don't," tells us that we are looking for something unusual.<n>3. Both clues work together to direct us towards fish that do something unusual.<n>4. Therefore, the answer must be a noun that is used to describe a fish.<n>5. The only choice that fits the above description is "fish".<n>

Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:If I have a forgiving attitude toward someone, what do they receive? Choices:  A: redemption B: isolation C: absolution D: great relief E: feel better<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales: 1 If I have a forgiving attic toward someone, what do the receive? <n>2. We immediately rule out the incorrect choice, A: redemption.<n>3. "Redemption" doesn't seem to describe a state of getting something.<n>4. "A forgiving attic " is a state of heart or mind.<n>5. The word "receive" describes something we get from someone.<n>6. When we get a state of heart, the only way to get it is through another's act.<n>7. So that means we receive a state of heart.<n>8. Next we look at choice B: isolation. If someone doesn't have a forgiving heart, they might be isolated, but the other doesn't receive anything by forgiving someone with an isolating attitude.<n>9. A forgiving heart is positive, while isolation brings only negatives.<n>10. Therefore, choice C: absolution, is likely to be the correct choice.<n>11. Option C: absolution, refers to complete forgiveness, and when we forgive others, they are forgiven for their wrongdoings. <n>12. Hence, choice C: absolve/forgive is the correct choice as the person forgives another.<n>13. Therefore, the correct answer is C: absolve.<n><n>Answer: C: absolve<n><n>### Instructions:Complete the following sentence.<n><n>### Input:[A: A B: C]<n><n>### Instrument:<n><n>### Demand:  <n><n>### Instagram:<n><n>### Question:<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>### Instructed:<n><n>### Response

Choices:  A: television B: dumpster C: landfill D: fox news E: trashcan<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. Where do you watch garbage? The sentence is asking for a location to put trash. <n>2. A trash can can house garbage, but the sentence states the sentence requires the speaker to watch the garbage.<n>3. Garbage contains the garbage which doesn’t match with the sentence. <n>4. The next option, Dumpster, can be used for storing garbage, but it doesn’ think that’ll be an appropriate response to where do you watch garbage? <n>5. Next option is landfill, which doesn’t match the sentence in any way. <n>6. The lastly, option is fox news, which is used to talk about trash, in politics or the media. <n>7. The sentence is not asking about it.<n>8. So, there are no appropriate choices for this question.<n>9.

He asked the desk assistant if she could tell him the way. (1) How did she respond? (2) What did she ask him for? <n>1.The sentence asks us about the action that the desk assistant took to respond to the man. <n>2.The sentence asks us the action that the desking assistant took that the man.<n>Answer: the action in the response could be the same as the question or different than the question.<n>In this case, it is different. For example, if the question asked how to get somewhere, the response could be by car or by foot.<n><n>### Choices for Input 1: A: I don’t know. B: I don’t think so. C: That’s wrong! D: How could you even ask that? E: You can’t! F: Well that’s interesting!<n><n>### Answer for Input 1:  E: You can’<n>The first choice B: I don't think so is wrong. It would be logical if the desk assistant wasn’t sure if she could tell the man the way, but the sentence did not use ‘if’ so that wouldn’t be correct. The second choice, C: ‘That’s wrong’ is wrong because if she said that, she’d be insulting the man. The third choice, D: ‘How could you even ask that’ is also wrong. That wouldn’t be a good response to the question because it is an insulting question. Therefore, the right answer choice is E: You can’.<n><n>The original response that was generated is shown below:<n><n><img src="./response_question1.jpg" width="700" height="500"><n><n>In the next part, we look at the proper sequence of generating a response.<n><n>## Generating A Response<n>This part defines the task of generating a response to the input response question

Choices:  A: planet B: basin C: submarines D: earth E: pacific<n><n>### Response:		What is needed is information pertaining to a particular ocean, the Atlantic, and not the planet itself. So, B, C, and D can all be rejected as the answer is planet.<n><n>As for E, it is wrong because Atlantic in the question refers to the ocean itself and not to the Pacific. So, the correct answer here is A: planet.<n>Answer: A: planet<n><n>### Input Question: A group of islands is referred to as an archipelago. What does 'group' mean, in this context? Choices: 1. A bunch of islands 2. Many islands 3. An assortment of islands 4. A set of islands 5. An amalgamation of islands<n><n>### Response<n><n>The correct choice is 'A bunch of islands', which correctly defines and clarifies 'group of islands'. The second choice, 'A bunch of islands' is a group, and it is a set of islands. 'Bunch' is a common word that can refer to an arrangement of things. 'Many' can refer to a group of things since the same word is used for people. 'Many' usually refers to a number of things, but it doesn't describe arrangement or quantity. 'An assortment of islands' is a very incorrect answer. An assortment is a grouping of dissimilar things. But 'group of islands' here refers to a setting or setting of islands, which is a common understanding of this expression. A collection of isles may or may not be'similar' to each other. 'Group of islands' doesn't mean a collection of islands. The last choice has also very wrong usage of the word'set'. Set is a word that has very specific meaning in statistics. These words are not interchangeable. The correct choice is option 1. Answer: A: Bunch<n><n>### Input question: Are there three options to the question 'is the question answered correctly, or no'?

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: beaver<n>B: animal<n>C: wooded area<n>D: body of water<n><n>### Response Explanation<n>1. The sentence asks about the feature that a beaver blocks.<n>2. The first word is 'beaver'. We need a corresponding noun to describe the feature that a beavers blocks.<n>3. 'Beaver' is a collective noun that refers to the animal. <n>4. So to write the response, first we need to describe 'beaver' into'specific animal'.<n>5. Then, we need to use a singular noun to describe 'the feature that a beaver blocks'.<n>6. But, 'a feature is indefinite since it is one of something and we cannot specify the type of feature.<n>7. But'specific animal' is an adjective that we can use to describe the animal's characteristics.<n>8. Then, we can make singular noun to describe the 'the feature that a specific animal blocks'.<n>9. 'Body of water' is used as an indefinite noun.<n>10. And 'zoo' is a place that contains animals.<n>11. And 'books' is where we write words or information.<n>12. So the ruling noun is'specific animal'.<n>13. Then, the features that a specific animal blocks are the body of water and zoos.<n>14. Next, we need to combine specific animal and body of water to form one adjective.<n>15. Then, we form one subject and verb to answer the question.<n>16. When writing the noun-forming part after beaver, we can write either beaver or the beaver.<n><n>### Input : When I was little, I wanted to be.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5.

Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station.

'Farm' cannot be an answer to this question because farming is not the purpose of a hotel.<n><n>2.[`Motel` is the correct answer] 'Motel' noun : a small hotel, especially one on a roadside in the US, providing a service for the public on an extended scale. (The) motel noun : a place where you can pay to sleep and have some food and other services.     'The motel industry has grown rapidly since the 1950s because of the spread of the motorways (which have made it possible for people to travel at high speeds).'​(Oxford Dictionary online) <n><n>3.'Town' is wrong option,because John did not stay in a town.<n><n>4.[`Hotel` is a very expensive place. It provides all the facilities like luxuries. Hotels are situated in cities. So, `hotel` is the answer to this question.<n>5. 'City' does not suit the question because the given question says that he did not want to waste money.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

"Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Traders work on the floor of the stock what?

In the sentence, the word anywhere refers to the fact that dog can sit down anywhere (in any location) in the house. Anywhere is a place where a dog can sit. 2. We are looking for a location, so we can immediately discard option A: in the corner of the  porch. 3. Option B: in the side porch can be used to express a location or a direction. So, we need to eliminate the location aspect of it. This option doesn’t answer the question. 4. Looking at option C: in the middle of the  porch, we can eliminate it. Middle can refer to a particular point or location. So, we don’t know if this option includes the center of the porce or the middle of the porce, as in middle part of the porce. Hence, we need to eliminate option too. 5. Looking at option D. in the corner in the porch, corner could be referring to any corner of the porch. So, because we cannot be sure as to which corner is referred to, we need to eliminate this option as well. 6. The last option E. in the center  of the porch refers to the center or middle of the porch.  This is the correct answer as it only describes a location.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Why does she sing so much?

The term "belong" means "to be used in an appropriate manner or place". So, option A: linen closets is incorrect because it does not mean an appropriate place, it could mean any closet, as long as it's a place to store the linen.<n>2. Option B: the kitchen is the appropriate place where we should put them. The term "them" can refer to the cloths.<n>The term "them" here represents cloths. <n>3. So, the answer to the question must be B: kitchen.<n>4. It is followed by option C: on the space. This doesn't make any sense because the space heater is not a place to hang things.<n>5. In option D: fabric store, we have similar language so, the same logic applies.<n>6. Option E: bedroom does not make sense because "bedroom" is inappropriate.<n>7.

Choices:  A: believe in god B: pay bills C: group together D: enjoy themselves E: face each other<n><n>### Response:		<n>The sentence states that people need to find ways of coming together, implying that there are ways to meet with other people. The third option, 'group together' is an activity or action that people perform, as opposed to a state or position. To meet with other people, there has to be an environment, so 'place' or 'location' is more suitable options. The first option, "believe in god" describes a state of having faith in god. While that can be an important way to meet people, it’s not about meeting each other as much as about faith and religion. The sentences talks about finding ways to come together, so something related to people meeting each other is more required. The second option, pay bills, doesn't reflect meeting each other. The fourth option, "enjoy themselves" implies that the people are already together, which isn't what the sentence asks for. 'Face each other', the last option, is another action or activity, which doesn't fit the question either. <n><n>The only option that describes a state of people meeting and not being an action or activity, is 'place'. It's the most suitable word for the answer because meeting people can't depend on an action or activity. It needs a location, so the answer is E: place.

We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What does exercising immediately lead to? Choices:  A: relaxation B: exhaustion C: energetic D: become stronger E: use energy<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: relaxation <n><n>Directions: Input:The last man to cross the finish line is the? Choices:  winner A: loser B: race competitor C: athlete D: prize competitor E: run winner<n>Rationales: In the race scenario, the runners who finish last are usually not counted or considered as part of the competition. Since the finish line is the last place where someone can cross, the last one to cross is not a competitor of the race. So, he isn't a loser or participant of the race, and the correct answer cannot be options A: loser or B: race competitor.<n><n>Next, the question asks for the correct person to describe the winner of the race scenario. This is usually the runner who passed the finish line first. He is also the athlete that took first place in the race competition. Therefore the option C: athlete is correct.<n>Similarly, if there were several runners crossing the finish line at the same time, we would have the option of race competitors, and the one that finished first in terms of time would also be counted as winner of the race in terms of position. So, the answer can't be E: prize competitor.<n>The correct answer therefore is athlete as it is the most suitable choice.<n><n>### Input<n>The last man to cross<n><n>### Response<n>Athlete<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank.

Choices:  A: cupboard B: chocolate C: coffee D: candy bar E: soda pop<n><n>### Response:		<n>There is a lot of energy in a chocolate bar.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The first word in the instruction is "there is a lot of" so we begin with the first letter "T" and move to the last letter "L" so the possible answer choices become TLLE and then LLE, the latter of which matches "a lot of sugar in what" perfectly.<n>2. The first letter after "a lot of" is an "L," so the next possible answer choice that fits is "L" meaning "candy bar" is the most likely answer.<n>3. However, we also look at the word "lot" and see if it's present in any other choice. The word "lot" is in the choices "a lot of sugar", so that's a better word match.<n>4. Next we look for another word match. We see the word "in" in the question, and the choice for "sugar" has it in the same spot, making that a better word match. Then we see the rest of the question and we figure out which choice fits, giving us "C" or candy bar.<n><n>## Difficult Words<n><n>| Word | Definition | Frequency-Word-count |<n>|:-:|:-:|:-:-:||<n>| A lot |  |  |<n>| chocolate |  |  | <n>| sugar |  |  |

Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid<n><n>### Response:		The sentence is asking what affected the school's efforts to change. Hence, the sentence is asking 'why'. Therefore, we can start looking for the 'why' clause. Since we are looking for 'why', the 'effort the school had made to changing' is the subject. The answer can only logically follow the subject. Looking at the options, 'ignore' is not logical since ignoring efforts is not why we would not change. 'Enforce' doesn't work since this answer choice doesn't explain why. 'Authoritarian', 'yerll at', and 'avoid' do not belong in a multiple choice question, they're phrases and not a choice. The last choice is 'yell at'. The 'yell at' explanation follows the logical flow of the sentence. I'm pretty sure. Hence, the answer to the question is 'B'. <n>Answer: B: yell at<n><n>### Input : You can't do it. So why try? Choices:  Choices: A: You will try again B: You will never try again C: You might fail<n><n>### Response : You can't, so why try. So, we can eliminate B. 'You might fail' does not match the logical flow of the question - so, it can be eliminated. What's left is A: You will try. So the answer is A. <n>Answer: A: You will fail<n><n>### Input - The two bosses were locked in a confrontation that the junior staff had to what?

The options do not make sense in relation to this sentence. (Listen to, overhear, witness, and hear) are actions that the staff is doing to learn about the fight - not necessarily a direct result of the fight. I think the correct answer is "D" intercept, which fits the role of a junior member of staff as a direct result of the two boss's argument.<n>Answer: D: Intercept<n><n>### Input- A very long day is coming to what?

Choices:  A: shirt pocket B: calligrapher's hand C: inkwell D: desk drawer E: blotter<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: C: inkwell. <n>The sentence is asking what we used to soak up excess ink from a flop pen.<n>8 options are given, out of which only one answer is correct for the task. The answer that we are looking for is inkwell.<n>The word ‘pen’ in the sentence could be replaced with any pronoun. This sentence can be rephrased to ask “What did flop-pen-washer-soaker people use to absorb ink?” The pronoun in the place of ‘pen’ must be an object. The sentence becomes clearer once the pronoun is added to the picture of the sentence. The sentence now reads as “Who used to soak up ink that fell in your flop-pen-soaker?” The question refers to the tool used to soak up extra ink from a pen. What do people use to absord extra ink from a floop pen. Thus, if we replace ‘pen’ with the pronoun ‘it’ in the original sentence, the sentence becomes “What do people use to soak up in extra ink from an item?” The word ‘item’ will refer to a tool that can absorb ink. The item that we can use to absorb inks extra ink from the floop pen can be an inkwell. The correct answer will be C: inkwell <n>Answer: C:inkwell<n><n>### Instructions: <n>Write a statement that describes the situation and presents a situation that is common in our daily lives<n><n>### Input<n>What is the main advantage of digital photography?

According to the United States Supreme Court, the case was that Catholic Social Services of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia did not need to make foster care placements outside of the same-sex coupled homes. The Philadelphia Department of Human Services also restricted faith-based organizations' services, from Catholic Social Services' foster care services, and the Philadelphia Department of Human Services was supposed to change its policies by following equal policies for all faith-based agencies and allowing the faith-based agency to provide services without involving the city of Philadelphia in the process.

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7.

Among them, the family of the victim did something to him. What was that? Choices:  A: knife wounds B: buy a gun C: bleeding D: jail time E: law suit<n><n>### Response:		The response that best completes the task will demonstrate an understanding of the question and a solid command of the language required. Your response should begin with the first sentence in which you paraphrase and respond to the prompt.<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>1. The prompt tells us that there are several consequences that a certain action can have on the person who did the action. The prompt then focuses us on the consequences of a single event.<n>2. Here we see this through the phrasing at the start: "of stabbing a stranger..." In this phrase, the stabbing is the action, and the stranger is the result, the consequence.<n>3. Once we know that the action is a stranger, the phrase that comes after "the family of the victim did... is to refer to a specific action. <n><n>4. "Did something" sounds ambiguous because it could refer to either the family or to the victim. However, the prompt then narrows down the choice to the family. We can't just decide to use "victim's family" either, as it would result in two actions occurring, which is not what the sentence wants<n>5. We can notice this because the question marks the two choices left and the answer is in the question itself: "... The family..." This means the family took an action.<n>6. The choices for did something are as follows: "... bleeding." We don't have family and victim all together as one action. The victim can't bleed... but the family can.<n>7. Answer A: bleeding is the right choice.<n>8. Answer: A: bleeding<n><n>### Input 1 : The students who didn't study passed by the class without knowing anything about the test.

The task doesn't ask for the meaning of the sentence. It asks for the meaning of the phrase "without knowing anything about the test". <n>2. "Didn't study" does not indicate that the students passed by. It indicates that they didn't study and that there are still other students who have studied for the test. They don't know anything about the test so that's why they don't study. But who

The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where would you see some people doing jumping jacks? Choices:  A: military base B: opera C: water fountain D: bus stop E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n>Because the answer involves people, this isn't a good option. And because "doing jumping jacks" is only performed during exercise, option A: Military Base wouldn't be the best answer. So the correct answer would be C: opera.<n><n>### Input:(There is) a lake in North Carolina. Choices:  A. No lake in North Carolina B: A lot of cactus in North Carolina C: 70's era in North Carolina D: not a lot of ozone in North Carolina E: no fish in North Carolina<n><n>### Response:-<n>This question was about whether North Carolina has a lake (which it does), so this answer isn't an option. But since the question didn't specify which lake, A. No lake in north Carolina is probably the correct answer because it's not a correct answer to question of if North Carolina has a lake or not.<n><n>### Response to answer<n>1. Lake: a large body of water surrounded by land.<n>2. Choice A doesn't make sense because North Carolina definitely has a lake, and they would certainly know that. "There is no lake" is an obvious lie, so they would never answer with that.<n>3. Choice B is also not a logical response because North Carolina does not and has not had anything to do with cactus.<n>4. Choice C is incorrect because it is in the wrong tense. It would be correct to say "70's era", but it should not be, "70's ERA in North Carolina".<n>5. Choice D is incorrect because although it's a "common knowledge" fact that a lot of ozone is in North Carolina, it is not correct because the person is specifically asking if there is a lake in North Carolina, not if there is a lot of ozone there.<n>6. Choice E is incorrect because it's possible North Carolina does not have fish. It is in fact not known if North Carolina has fish or not, so this option would technically be correct, though very unlikely.<n>7. Therefore A. No lake in N. Carolina is the correct answer<n><n>### Instructions:Read the following text to answer the question.<n><n>## The new restaurant was built in a remote town.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5.

Choices:  A: music store B: dance hall C: orchestra D: symphony E: tennessee<n><n>### Response:		D: Symphony<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>1. "Where is there" means that we are looking for a place, not for something like "is playing" or "will be played". That is, the answer must be a place.<n>2. "Fiddle playing" is an act, not a place, so it won't suit the phrase "usually a".<n>3. "Music store" is also an act, and is something people look for in a music store.<n>4. "Dance hall" is a place, but "fiddle playing", is not playing, and a fiddle is only an instrument.<n>5. "Orchestra" is a place, although people with a fiddle in the orchestra may or may not be playing it.<n>6. "Symphony" is probably what you think of when you think of a symphony orchestra.<n>7. Therefore the answer is B: dancehall.<n><n>### Input where is the piano located?<n><n>

Complex is more intense and deeper than simple, which means that complex is more strong than simple. A machine that is simple is easy to explain on the contrast the machine was quite and this complex implies that the machine would be deep in its operations. Machine is an inanimate object that does not possess the ability to think, so the deepness in this machine can only be shown by its operations and weaker than other machines so it is quite a machine to beholds.<n><n>### Feedback: This example describes how to find the correct choice for multiple choice questions. <n>### Difficulty: [Hard]<n>### Skill: [Language]<n>### Feedforward:<n>Congratulations!

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where can meat last a long time? Choices:  A: backery B: ham sandwich C: fridge D: butcher shop E: freezer<n><n>### Response:		The only place that meat is guaranteed to last longer is in the freezer. Incorrect: The B&Q is the place that you should go.<n><n>### Answer: D: Butcher shop<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Input: How much does a ticket cost for the match? Choices: 1: A two pound ticket, as well as 2: a three pound ticket. Choice: No ticket.<n>Rationales: One can infer that the match is a football match.<n>If the ticket price is too high it is not sold out.<n>If the match is between two good teams it is guaranteed to be sold out.<n><n>**Answer: 2**: a three pound<n><n>Input: How are you going to the match? Choices A: bus, B: car, C: by foot, D: by train.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Input: How were you going to make dinner? Rationales: 1 There is only one question mark so this is an interrogative sentence ( a question ). <n>2 This is not an imperative sentence. <n><n>Answer: A: by train.<n>

Choices:  A: empathy B: anxiety C: knowlege D: falling down E: hear things<n><n>### Response:		<n>* A: The answer requires the teacher to tell all the students that listening is the main way they would achieve "knowledge.". However, "empathy" is a mental state. "Anxiety" is a emotion. "Knowledge" and "being" "falling down" are not the same thing as knowledge. Finally "hear things" does not answer the question as hearing things is just a form of listening.<n>* B: "Anxiety" refers to a condition, which can happen without listening. "Falling down" is not an actionable verb.<n>* C: "Knowledge" doesn't refer to just learning, but instead could mean everything one has learn about something or even the act of knowing itself. It can't be the main way "knowledge" would be acquired. Also, "knowledge" is a noun.<n>* D: "Hearing things" is an action, it requires the listeners to hear things.<n>* E: "Empathy" again is a mental state.<n><n>The right answer is C: knowledge<n><n><n>### Instructions:Read the text, then answer the questions.

The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where is a tabby cat likely to be happiest?

The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1.

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:There weren't potatoes but actually a snake in his what? Choices:  A: burlap sack B: hot country C: purse D: pet shops E: deep grass<n><n>### Response:		Demonstration:<n>Rationales:1. "What" at the start of the question asks us to choose the noun for the what in which snake is hiding. <n>2. There is no potato in the paragraph and so cannot be a noun.<n>3. "Hot country" is a noun phrase, but it is used to define "what". "What" is the target of the phrase "hot country".<n>4. "Purse" and "pet shops" are not nouns so they cannot be a "what".<n>5. "Deep grass" is also a noun phrase and it is also an answer for the question "what". The sentence says "the snake hiding deep in the tall grass".<n>6. Therefore, the answer for the question "What" is "Deep grass".<n>The answer: B: Deep grass<n><n>

But the benefits are more.<n><n>### Answer for Question<n>There are number of advantages of social media for students. Firstly, social media has a positive effect to students on their language skills. Language skills can be enhanced when students interact with one another. As students on social media communicate well, they are more likely to use specific words. Then, students have more opportunities to learn new words. So, social media can help students’ language skills. Secondly, social media is helpful for students for communication. Students can use social media to express their opinions and share with other people. Therefore, students can learn to communicate with others who are different from them and learn more people. Meanwhile, students can develop their interpersonal skills. They are more able to collaborate with others, resolve disputes, and appreciate other’s perspectives. In addition, social media is helpful to build students confidence. They are able to share their opinions, interests, experiences, and other things in their life to the world, and their post will be seen by many people and it helps them to build confidence. Finally, social media is useful for students to connect people. Students can make new friends easily through social media. They can form groups through social media and interact with each other. After that, they can have a good relationship with them. Social media can help students to solve many problems.<n>### Summary: This topic is Social Media and its use.<n>The topic is about the use of social media and whether it is beneficial or not.

The word 'food' only refers to food in the context. 'Spending money' is more suitable to describe this activity.<n><n>* The wordwalking is an adjective, which isn't suitable to describe a place.<n><n>* A market is primarily a place for buying and selling goods, so'market' is the most appropriate adjective.<n><n>Response: D: spending money

Choices:  A: fishing camp B: hardware store C: engine D: your spine E: sporting goods store<n><n>### Response:		The sentence is basically asking us what we've caused damage to by throwing a rod, and we can use answer choices to help us figure this out.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. "You" can be eliminated as an answer choice since it is already being used as part of the sentence.<n>2. "Fishing camp" is not correct because this is not something we can damage by throwing a rod.<n>3. "Hardware store" is not correct because a hardware store sells tools, it's not something that is damaged in the same way cars or computers are damaged.<n>4. "Engine" is not correct because it is not something that can be physically thrown out.<n>5. We can eliminate "your spine" as a choice because it doesn't make sense when combined with the remaining answer choices.<n>6. "Sporting goods store", the correct answer, refers to a store where sports equipment can be bought, so the sentence refers to something that has been damaged by throwing a rod while shopping for sports equipment, like tennis rackets and field hockey sticks (which both need handlebars).<n>Answer: Sporting goods store<n><n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5.

Examples include: happiness, courage, and kindness. Some words are abstract nouns by themselves, as in "the courage to face death." Others are concrete nouns, or the "crowds of courageous people" or the "courageous soldiers."<n><n>#### Rationale:<n>1. We understand that the pronoun “they” in the sentence is referring to the concrete nouns (“crowds” and “soldiers”); therefore, in the sentence, ‘courageous’ is an (abstract) noun.<n>2. For this reason, it is called an Abstract (Count) Noun.<n>3. However, if someone says “courage is hard to face death”, this sentence is referring to a person who is courageous (‘cunningly fearless or daring’), or ‘manly courage’.<n>4. The sentence states that "everyone knows that courageous men are not usually cowards”, which makes clear that courage should not be thought of “the kind of courage (or kind of man) who faces death”. <n><n>#### Example:<n><n>> The courageous men always fight for what they believe.<n><n>5. Thus here, "courageous" refers to a type of people rather than an abstraction, which is an adjective.<n>6. Therefore, here, "men" is the Subject, and it means the word "courageous" is the Adjective; and it follows the verb "fight".<n>7. This is referred to as a subject-verb pairing<n><n>7. As we can see, “courage

Choices: A: home B: school C: library D: university<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The word 'usually' tells us that the question refers to a frequently visited location.<n>2. We can immediately rule Out option A: home because if you're going to spend a quiet evening, home would be a location you'd go home to, which doesn't necessarily answer the question.<n>3. Next, we check option B: school. If you're going to be spending a quiet evening, chances are you're doing it in the evenings, meaning'school' doesn't answer the questions.<n>4. We then move on to option C:library, which is indeed a location you'd find quiet during the evenings. However, there's no reason to 'go to' the library unless you have a library card and need to return something, which isn't what the question is asking.<n>5. Next, we look at option D: university. Universities are places where quiet studying generally occurs because people are studying there, but there's no reason for these two friends to get together to study while there are so many other quiet locations that were never mentioned.<n>6. Option E: restaurant can only be answered correctly if there had been a mention that food was going to be shared and that food didn't have to be cooked at home, otherwise this would be the wrong answer to the question.<n>7.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Jackson is a popular city name, but the one with a governor's office is where? Choices:  A: michigan B: wyoming C: mississippi D: tennessee E: mississippi<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationale<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: What are you looking at? Choices: <n>A: the ceiling B: the window C: table D: the wall E: the floor<n>Rationales:<n>1. What is “you” referring to? The pronoun “you”, when used without a subject, could be referring to anyone.<n>2. “At” implies that you are looking at something. Therefore, it’s possible that you are looking at things on the ceiling, on the wall, on the floor, or on the window.<n>3. "Table", the first choice, is a piece of furniture and doesn’t provide sufficient context. <n>4. Similarly, "A: the ceiling" implies that "you" could be looking at things on the wall, but a ceiling doesn’t provide any additional information.<n>5. Next, consider "D: the wall". This answer also fits the question's structure, but still does not provide sufficient context. It's true that the wall is what you can be looking at, but why are you looking at the wall?<n>6. Another option is "E: the floor". This answer could also be correct. However, the word “floor” by itself does not provide sufficient context, and doesn’t adequately specify what we are looking at. So, the answer is ambiguous and could mean any floor in the building.<n>7. The last possibility is "B: the window". The word “window” immediately gives you an idea of what is being referred to. It also follows logically that the "… window", in this context, refers to the objects in the window.<n>8. Therefore the answer is B: the window.<n>Answer: B) the window<n><n>### <n><n>We'll start with a multiple choice question in order to practice answering multiple choice questions.<n>```<n>Which of the following is a preposition?<n>```<n>A.

This sentence could be wrong or this information might be wrong; Eating breakfast in bed can't make me feel "vomiting".<n>Option B: pleasure is also incorrect. If I don't spill breakfast in bed, I feel better about it. I feel better because the bed is a comfortable place for me to eat breakfast, and I can still enjoy the food.<n>Options C: happiness and D: contentment have similar ideas. However, eating breakfast in the bed does not have happiness or contentment. They are the feelings that I have after eating the food in the comfortable bed instead of having happiness.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Blood isn't usually spilled during what sport that doesn't allow the use of hands?

This is  is a position on what? Choices:  A: violin case B: symphony orchestra C: class D: learning to play violin E: music store<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Demostration:<n>1. In the first sentence, 'John just made first violins'. The first violin is the first one John made from scratch. <n>2. Now we have to give a suitable noun position to John's first violin. <n>3. This is to indicate the place where it should be placed or displayed, such as above the fireplace, on the mantlepiece or shelf, or displayed at an exhibit.<n>4. The first position that comes to mind is the violin case. This option would not be accurate because the sentence specifically mentions that the first violin made would not be placed in the violin case, but displayed on the mantlepiec e (or shelf, or exhibit).<n>5. The verb 'play' in the sentence indicates that the first violin is a musical instrument, so option C: Class would not work, as classes deal with non-musical topics.<n>6. Option D is also inappropriate, as it is not related to violins or a special skill needed to play them; option D: learning to play the violin is only learning to play in general.<n>7. As a musical instrument, the violin comes in different sizes, with the larger ones being known as violins in orchestras.<n>8. Hence, to correctly answer the question, we have to look at option E, which is a music store that sells musical instruments.<n>Answer: E. music store<n><n>## Part 2: Reading Comprehension<n><n>### Instructions: A section from the textbook is given below.

B: Oil Producing Company of Eastern Countries<n>3. C: Oil Producing Coalition of Eastern Countries<n>4. D: Organization Producing Coal Producing Countries of the East<n>5. E: Organization for the Producing of the Eastern Countries<n><n>### Choice: The acronym, which is OPEC, can be divided into a noun and a verb, Oil and Producing. Therefore, Choice E: Organization for Producing Coal Produce Countries of East would work if it only omitted the 'E' at the end, which makes it impossible. Choice D: Organization Produce Company Countries of East is a similar type of sentence, the verb was omitted and the verb "produce" was instead of "producing" at the end, but still it is in the wrong form. Choice C: Producing Coalition Countries of the Eastern is even wrong because there are no capital letters before the nouns as it should be. Choice A: Producing Countries of Countries of Eastern is like Choice C because there is no capital letter before the nouns. The same goes for Choice D because the nouns are in this case countries and not the same as the ones in Choice A: Produce Countries of the Countries of Eastern. The only sentence which reflects the correct answer is Choice B: for the Oil Producing Countires of Eastern Countries because the choice contains no words that do not reflect the acronym. The answer to this question is, therefore, Choice B: Organization Producing Countries of East<n>Answer: B: Organization for Produce Eastern Count

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where are floors kept clean for holy purposes?

The first option, ‘A: condition heart’, is false as exercise itself doesn’t condition your heart, it’s what you do while you’re exercising that conditions your heart<n>2. The second option, ‘B: expend energy’, is the correct option. A lot of exercise can help you relieve stress and relieve anxiety by helping you expend energy. Exercise can also be part of a lifestyle that helps you quit drinking or smoking.<n>3. The third choice, ‘D: stretch’, does not accurately describe why exercise is a healthy way of dealing with addictions.<n>4. The fourth choice, ‘C: laugh’, does not help addicts deal with their addictive impulses.<n>5. The fifth answer, ‘E: weigh’, is not a suitable option, as although exercise can sometimes help you feel better by making you weigh less. Exercise does not directly help with addiction, it’s more about the psychological benefits and how exercise helps the health of your body. Exercise can boost your ability to think clearly, improve your mood and even help you sleep better.<n>6. The only correct option according to the text is ‘B: expend’, so choice B is the correct answer.<n><n>Answer: B: expend<n><n>### Instructions:Choose no more than 2 best answers from the following questions to answer the question below.<n><n>### <n><n>###  Answer: B, D<n><n>### Rationale # 1:<n>Input: 1) A pink dress would make a great addition to the wardrobe of 2) A 8 year old girl. Explanation: It shows that the target audience for the dress is 8 year old girl, thus we need to choose B or D as we have not specified a gender.<n><n>### Rational # 2:<n> Input: 1) A green dress might look great on 2) A 13cm model. Explanation: The sentence says 13cm model rather than a model of 13cm.

Choices:  A: downtown area B: container C: ocean floor D: the lost city of atlantis E: high school<n><n>### Response:		Answer the following multiple-choice question and choose the option that best suits the sentence. <n><n>### Rational:<n>7. The question asks for a noun that should fill in the blank. The noun is a place that we get something from.<n>8. 'Lost city of Atlantis' in the response is not a good option because although it is a noun that could be found on an atlas or in the dictionary, it doesn't describe a particular place.<n>9. 'High school', an option, is a place of education, so it would be suitable if it was combined with the right sentence, but it doesn’ t describe a place where we get anything.<n>10. So, there is still a need for another place in the options. <n>11. The fourth option, 'downtown area', is a location in a city where people from the suburbs or suburbs visit to get shopping items, so people will usually return to their original residence after they have completed their purchase.<n>12. The last option of choices, 'the ocean floor', may appear to describe a place where people get things from, but it is not applicable to the sentence because it does not describe a place where people go to get something.<n>13. Therefore, the remaining answer is C: container. <n><n>## Output:Answer the following multiple question.

Where does he live? Choices:  A: fish market B: pet shop C: great outdoors D: river E: little mermaid<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Demonstraion:<n>1. The problematic part of this question is: “lives free”. Blowfish lives free, so 100% correct. But, he “lives on his own”, which means he does not live in a group. That is, he lives alone. <n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. "A blowfish lives free." In this question, we are asked to figure out where in nature a blowfish lives. We know it is a fish. So, we cross off options A: fish market, B: pet shop, D: river, which are not natural environments for fish<n>2. Next, to narrow down the options left, we see that the phrase "live on his own" doesn't really fit there. That is because a fish lives among other fish, or in one's fish tank. So, we cross it out as an option as well. <n>3. So, the only possible answer must be E: Little Mermaid.

Choices:  A: overpopulation B: birth C: presents D: propagation E: fun<n><n>### Response:		The most appropriate answer depends on the context. In this case, it seems like the sentence was likely intended to refer to a new individual as its conclusion and end of the reproduction process. The first choice, "overpopulation" could describe a high population of people, but it isn't the same as a new individual. The second choice, "birth" may refer to the process of reproduction but it doesn't describe anything beyond the reproduction process itself. The third choice, "presents" doesn't make sense. The fourth choice, "propagation" could mean the reproduction of something, but doesn't describe a new individual in the process of reproduction. Finally, the fifth choice, "fun" doesn't relate to reproduction at all. The only choice to complete the sentence is the sixth choice, "new life."<n><n>### Output:How long can human exist?<n><n>### Rationale:<n>"Humans" are typically a group of living beings, so the question should be asking how long human beings can exist. This answer refers to how long people can exist and not how long an individual is able to exist. Therefore, the correct answer is plural "humans". <n><n>The correct response should be "Long enough to die." The sentence talks about how important having good health is and not how long human beings exist, so the second choice, "As long as we are alive" doesn´t satisfy the sentence. Also, "We can exist without knowing it" doesn't satisfy the sentence because the term "existant" refers to something that can be identified, so in this context, "existent" doesn't make much sense. The third and fourth choices are synonyms ("Healthy", "Sound"), so "Healthy enough to die" satisfies the sentence because that means that having good health is enough to die. The last choice is grammatically incorrect, and therefore, doesn't satisfy the correct grammatical structure for this sentence. <n><n>### Instructions:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>### Input<n>Who is the most important person in your life?<n><n>### Response <n>There is more than one correct answer.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:If one sees a fox and is standing in a landlocked, southern state, where is this person? Choices:  A: at the zoo B: south carolina C: hen house D: louisiana E: arkansas<n><n>### Response:		Louisiana.<n><n>### Rationales: 1: The phrase “landlocked, southern state” indicates a state in the southern United States that is completely surrounded by other states and bodies of water (so no coastline), so it has to be in the middle of the USA. 2: The term “south carolina” refers to that state - a southern state in the U.S. - but there are 2 other states (Alabama and Tennessee) that are more south that it. Hence, we can disregard this. 3: The term “louisiana” refers to a state in the southern USA that lies on the gulf of mexico, so it does not fit the requirement for “landlocked” (although it is in the south). 4: The term “arkansas” refers to a state that lies in the Southern US, on the Mississippi river, but the question asked us to find a “landlocked, southern-state”. It is not a “landlocked state”, so we can disregard it. 5: The only state left to choose from is “louisiana” or “Mississippi” because the other two states mentioned (Alabama and Tennessee, respectively) is not part of the south. 6: Looking at “louisiana”. 7:  If you visit the state of “louisiana”, you can see animals in a zoo - which is something only humans can do, so it is safe to say that the person is a human being. 8: The question was about a person’s location, so it would only be reasonable to use the answer for the location - that is, the state of Louisana. 9: The only place where they can be that fit the requirements is Louisiana.<n><n>### Input:-What time is it in Tokyo? -What time is it in Paris?<n><n>### Response:-Paris.<n><n>### Justification: 1. Tokyo is a city in Japan, so the sentence implies that there are several Tokyo’s in the world.<n>2. We cannot use the word 'Tokyo' because of 1.).<n>3. 'Time' = 'hora' in spanish. <n>4. So, "hora en Tokio" = "hora en Tokio"?<n>5. No. <n>6. We have to put what time it is in paris. <n>7. If

The sentence uses the phrase"... built," as the answer would need to have something or somebody build the legs.<n>3. A jail, the first option, is where people are built, not things.<n>4. The internet cafe, the second choice, does not need the legs to be built.<n>5. The blacksmith’s shop is not used to build furniture.<n>6. A building is where furniture is built, especially at a bar, where people like to sit.<n>7. Therefore the answer is E, a building.<n><n>## Solutions:<n>1.

Input: Where can we find an English teacher? Choices: 	A: online B: school C: work D: workshop E: blackboard<n><n>2. Rationales:<n>3.  The sentence uses the phrase “find (someone to)”, so the answer would need to be a place where we could find somebody.<n>4.  We could not find a teacher here.<n>5.  Option A: online, the first choice gives the wrong advice.<n>6.  Option B: school, the second choice, while the place we most likely go to find a teacher, is not applicable to this question “Where”.<n>7.  Option C: work, the third choice, while something that most adults do have, does not provide the same advice as where to go to look for something.<n>8.  Option D: workshop, the fourth choice, is more like a specialized place, not very likely to find a teacher.<n>9.  Option E: blackboard, while a place to study English, does not provide the "where the teacher is found” information.<n>10.  So, the conclusion is that the only choice that fits is E: blackboard.<n>11.  The answer to this question is E. <n><n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What are students trying to do? Choices:  A: study philosophy B: become adult C: ask questions D: further education E: study together<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Response Rationales: <n>**Step 1**: **Check for grammatical and spelling errors in the statement** The statement, "What are students trying to study?" doesn't seem completely grammatically correct, so look for any spelling or grammatical errors that may exist in it.<n><n>**Step 2** **Determine the meaning of the sentence** When determining the meaning, first look at the verbs and identify the subject.<n><n>**Step3** "Students is trying to study"<n><n>**Step 4** **Identify the function of the sentence**<n><n>**Step 5** Now, look at the last step. After identifying the meaning of the sentence, read through what you have written. The sentence here will be in form of a noun (students). **Step 6** "Students trying to study"<n>### Step 7 : **Give the correct word that fits the request**<n>**Step 8** To find the meaning of each choice, look at each word and identify which one has a similar meaning to the sentence.<n><n>**Step9** In this question, we get to know what are students trying to study? So, we need the word that is studying.

Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:1. The correct option is C: tool box.<n>2. This is because the noun screw describes the type of tool that would be used in an activity. This activity entails using the screw as a tool.<n>3. The noun ring cannot be used in this activity.<n>4. Screw refers to a metallic tool having a helical shape, so it cannot be used to fix something.<n>5. There is also another possibility that the nouns screw and ring are not in the preposition phrase "onto something."<n><n>Answer: C: tool box. <n><n>### Instructions:Which of the following is similar? Answer: Choice (d) Choices:  A. A is similar to F. B. A is similar to E. C. A is similar to D. D. A is similar to C.  E. A is similar to B.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Option (a) and (b): "A is similar to F" means that the shape of A is the same as the shape of F.<n>2. In option (a) the noun "shape" modifies the word "A" because it explains how the thing is similar between A and F.<n>3. Option (c) is wrong: the phrase "A is similar to D" is wrong because the shape of D is sharper than the sharpness of A.<n>4. Option (d) is correct because the shape of A and C are similar with the shape of F and B. (E, F, G)<n>5. Hence, the correct answer is (d).<n><n>Answer: D. A is similar with C.<n><n>### Response<n>#### Instructions: <n>```<n>Which of the following sentences is similar with A? Answer: Choice(a) Choices: <n>1.	A. A is like C.<n>2.	B.

Choices:  A: sheath B: sword closet C: collection D: container called scabbard E: museum<n><n>### Response:		<n>A scabbard is a container used to keep swords. Therefore, if we use the term "scabbard" it would make sense because that's where we would find our swords. This fits in with the question: where would you find some sward in your house?

The first sentence informs us that the garage had light sensored and automatic doors, but doesn’t help us answer.<n>2. The second sentence states that the type of house it is, and provides the options, modern, building, townhouse, neighbours house and downtown house.<n>3. If the house has light sensored and automatic door, it’s likely a modern. However, other type of houses can have those too.<n>4. The answer A:  modern is unlikely.<n>5. Thus, it’s likely to be F: downtown.<n>6. So, the answer is C: downtown.  <n><n>Answer: D: downtown. <n>### Output:<n>### Demonsation<n>The garage had modern seniors and automatic doors what type of house was?<n><n>I assume the garage is a house and it was located on the city center.<n><n>### Rationale<n>The original sentence asks for an appropriate choice, which is likely one that the student might come across.<n><n>Answer: B. downtown

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:John was stuck in his house.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What are you hoping to do when listening to an expert speak? Choices:  A: learning B: fatigue C: mercy D: empathy E: anxiety<n><n>### Response:		The experts were offering advice which means that the audience wants to learn.<n>### Rationales: The sentence mentions expert and audience, both of which are defined as two different people.<n>The given information is, experts have information, which means that they possess certain capabilities in a certain range that the audience does not. If a speaker does not have the ability to communicate the relevant information it is likely that the audience might not fully understand the message.<n>These are the only two people presented in the sentence. Hence, the answer "learning" is most likely.<n><n>Answer: Learning<n><n>###  Input: What will we do after dinner today? Choices: <n><n>A: Going home or B: To the movies. <n>### Rational: The instruction mentions after dinner, and dinner is most likely over, indicating the after dinner activity. Additionally, the activity should not include dinner but should include the other activities of the evening. Because dinner has ended, the action needs to occur sometime later in the evening. <n>### Answer: B) Going to the movies.<n><n>### Input : Does your dad play any musical instruments? Choices A: Guitar B: Piano C: Singing D: Drinking wine and having friends, playing guitar. E: Violin.<n><n>### Rational : The answer is D: Drinking wine. <n><n>From the given text, it is clear that the father plays the guitar, and it doesn’t involve the other things with it. It may involve one or many activities, but the answer is the drinking wine. It cannot be the singing option because the option talks about one, but the drinking wine has multiple people involved in the activity, thus, contradicting the idea of drinking wine.<n><n>Answer: D: Drinking wine with friends<n>

'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank.

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:The snake was a cottonmouth.  It was an American, from where? Choices:  A: georgia B: tree C: nature D: under the rocks E: france<n><n>### Response:		D: under the rocks <n><n>### Input<n>Input: Who are you calling? Choices: 1. B: myself 2.C: I 3. A: myself 4. D: I<n><n>### Response<n>Input: A: myself B: I C: myself D: I<n><n><n>### Instructions:<n>Write a response that appropriately answers the question below.<n><n>### Rationales<n> 1. Who are you calling? <n> 2. This is a question asking who the interlocutor is calling.<n>3. "Who" refers to the interlocutor - the person making the call.<n><n>4. "Answer my phone calls" is an instruction to the interlocutor to take action.<n>5. We can immediately rule option A: B: myself. This indicates the interlocutor should answer the call.<n>6. Same reasoning applies to B: I, as this indicates the interlocutor answering the call.<n>7. Option C: myself is a word in the verb phrase "answer my phone calls".<n>8. We need to figure out whether it is the interlocutor being referred or another individual.<n>9. Since all other options are related to answering the call, we can eliminate C: myself.<n>10. Next, we look at option D: I. This is basically saying "answer my call". Hence, this too refers to the interlocuter in the instruction to answer the phone call.<n>11. Therefore, the answer to the interrogative should be D: I. <n>12. Answer: D: I<n>13. So the correct answer is C: myself.<n><n>```<n>Input:  Who are you calling?<n>Answer:  D: I<n>```<n><n>### Instructin:<n>   Write a response that appropriates the question below.<n>```<n>Instructions:  The answer is D: I.

Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:A person takes a seat to watch a movie, where is he? Choices:  A: in cinema B: at the park C: martorell D: jeep E: airplane<n><n>### Response:		<n>1.The sentence asks for a location, where is the person.<n>2. He can't be in A: In cinema because watching movies isn't his main purpose.<n>3. He can't also be in B: at the park because he is sitting to watch a movie in a cinema.<n>4. He can't either be in C: martorell because it isn't a location.<n>5. He can be in D: jeep. because the jeep is a place where someone can sit.<n>6.

Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. There is no check box at the cash register. If there is a box, it would not be used to store checks.<n>2. A desk drawer would not be large enough for the size of a check.<n>3. A pay envelope would be the preferred method of distributing checks.<n>4. Checks are not thrown away.<n>5. They are placed in a box, usually in a reception area.<n>6. "Where does a clerk put them" is referring to a box or reception area/location to hold the check until a recipient comes to collect it.<n>7.

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**Input:** <n>>What is love when everyone feels it?<n><n>**Rationales:**<n><n>1. It is asking what is the meaning the word love when people all feel the same thing.<n>2. The sentence suggests that everyone is feeling something that was previously unknown to be "love" and that because everyone is feeling it that they are not actually feeling love.<n>3. We have two options here where A says 'contagious' which is the feeling that love is contagious in the form of spreading to people you love or through interactions.<n>4. This doesn't quite describe the "feeling when everyone feels it" feeling. This suggests that everyone is feeling love but it isn't 'contagious love' or 'a feeling that love is contrabisous' it means people are feeling love and everyone is feeling the same thing.<n>5. B says 'last forever' which suggest a long feeling of love or an on going feeling of love.<n>6. This doesn't describe it exactly as it suggests everyone is feeling some type of on going love.<n>7. C says 'painful' which doesn't describe the feeling of love everyone is actually feeling.<n>8. D says 'wrong' which does suggest a slight misunderstanding on why everyone is feeling love but not love itself.<n>9. Lastly E says 'blind' which describes the opposite case that we have already concluded as wrong, where everyone is feeling love but they are not understanding the feeling of love.<n>10. This doesn't explain the whole 'everyone keeps feeling it' part which is why B is the best answer to this question.<n>11. The best answer is B: it is last forever.<n>12. <n>>In conclusion it is obvious that people are feeling love and not some other feeling.<n><n>Answer: B: Last forever<n><n>---<n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:The delivery man was delivering a whole crate of shampoo, they went through a lot of it at the what?

Choices:  A: control people B: settle everything C: buy food D: increase power E: kill bill<n><n>### Response:		D: increase power<n><n>The answer is correct if I understand why it is so. The whole question revolves around power and influence. When Johnny wanted to change the argument to resolve it, he tried to maintain his power in the process. Therefore, if we look at it from Johnny's perspective, it's obvious that he's going to try to increase his power to resolve the problem. He is not going to accept defeat, because when the struggle is over, the only thing that changes is his power status. The argument is over and Johnny is now left with no chance to win in the conflict. To change the outcome of the struggle, he will try to change the problem itself.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

Choices:  A: eat ice cream B: have sex C: sit down D: make mistakes E: hear sounds<n><n>### Response:		<n>The first sentence introduces the topic and establishes the action. "Humans" is doing "something." We don't know what that something is, but we can infer that it is related to reproduction. <n>The second sentence suggests the types of behaviors we might expect to see. This is where you can use deduction (to learn something you haven't been told). In most cases, the behaviors will be the opposite of the types of behaviors you encounter when a machine is malfunctioning. <n>In the case of this example, we know that we see people eating ice cream all the time. We see human beings "making mistakes" all the time, but, again, we don't tend to see them "sitting down" or doing things like "hearing sounds." Therefore, the opposite of these behaviors must be the ones we expect when people are actively reproducing. <n><n>The response is:<n><n>1. "Have sex" makes sense because it's the type of activity where something might 'come out' and be passed on to the next person.<n>2. "Make mistakes" is not something we'd expect in this type of activity. We see a lot of people eating ice creams, but that doesn't mean they're reproducing. The only thing that makes sense is "sit down" as an activity.<n><n>Answer: Have sex   Make mistake   Sit down<n>

D. You always go with me. E. He won’t take me.<n><n>### Response : C. You always go with him.<n>### Rationals : 1) The sentence is talking about the situation where He won’t lent him money for his car.<n><n>2) The sentence says "He won’t lend" so we know for sure that the noun "He" will not lend the noun "me".<n><n>3) The rest of the sentence explains the situation and the subject is He and not me. So, it is He that He won't lend not me.<n><n>4) Now, if we look at the options available. We don’t have the word lend or give me in the options. So option (A) you always borrows from him is ruled out as it does not support the context and the sentence.<n><n>5) The next option we rule out is (E)He won’t take me as we can’t really lend people we only lend things and it is incorrect structure.<n>

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car.

Choices:  A: cause spots on leaf B: healthy C: wellness D: ball stopped E: cure<n><n>### Response:		<n>There is no correct answer as it is not even asking if the disease was spreading or not, so option "A" should be there.<n><n>### Output:<n><n>Input: The disease was spreading fast. What were researchers desperatly seeking? Choices: A: cure B: cause spots on the leaf C: healthy D: wellness E: ball stopped<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>The sentence "The disease was spreading...." is a description of a situation, so it's used to give information about what's happening at a specific moment in time. It is not a question, so it doesn't expect a response.<n><n>The question asks about something that "researchers were desperately seeking", or what they were desperately searching for. It does not ask if the disease was spread by a specific thing (like the "Leaf spot disease", which is mentioned in the question). Therefore, it is not asking for an answer that provides specific details about the disease, and can be omitted from the question.<n><n>Therefore, if the sentence had asked: "What was causing the spread of the disease?" the correct response would be "the leaf spots".<n><n>If the sentence asked: "What were researchers desperation seeking?", the correct response would be the correct answer.<n><n>Thus, the correct answer to "What were researchers desparetly seeking?" given the correct sentence structure is answer choice A: "Cause".<n>

Choices:  A: mobile phone B: wristwatch C: briefcase D: office E: desktop<n><n>### Response:		<n>Detailed solution:<n><n>1. "Nowadays" tells us that the question is asking what an ancient gadget was used for in the modern era.<n>2. "People" is a plural pronoun that requires at least two antecedents.<n>3. "have" is a present participle that requires an object (has+P).<n>4. We can use the pronoun 'ones' or 'a' to denote the personified subjects having the object of the sentence. <n>5. So, the sentence requires a singular noun.<n>6. "a tiny calculator" is a singular noun phrase.<n><n>1. Looking at the verbs of the sentence, "to have", "to be" and no other verbs.<n>2. We can conclude that the noun phrase, "a tiny calculator", is the object for the verbs.<n><n>1. We can eliminate the first three sentences because they are not noun phrases and do not reflect the meaning of the sentence.<n><n>1. The rest of the options can be eliminated because they are wrong in meaning.<n><n>1. "a desktop" is not a single machine used to do calculations.<n><n>1. It is a general category name given to a group of computing components or devices such as a keyboard, monitor and mouse.<n><n>1. This is a noun phrase referring to a collective group of devices, so it cannot be the object of the sentence (i.e. the what? in the question).<n><n>1. Likewise, "a briefcase" and "an office" refers to devices that are used to store or carry other things, so they cannot be the object of having a tiny calculator.<n><n>1. Therefore, the correct answer is E: desktop.<n><n>### Answer:<n>E: desktop<n><n><n>### Input:[A]nd they're more advanced and they're less expensive and they're more portable and many companies have them now.[B] They also have more capabilities.[C] If you want one that's cheap, then, yeah, you can buy a simple cell phone.[D] They can also cost a lot of money![E] Some can be like two hundred sixty dollars![]<n><n>### Response:[A]<n><n>### Detailed solution:<n><n>Input: (A)<n>1.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where do you go to meet a friend who lives close to you?

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Demolition:<n>- 'chaos' in the sentence denotes that parents are making a great mess and losing their sense of direction<n>- this usually leads them to yelling in order to get the situation back to a sense of calm and order<n><n>- the verb 'yell' represents the kind of disorderly behavior parents are showing as a result of these difficulties, and it is therefore suitable to represent the 'guide children' parental intention<n><n><n><n>### Input Parents often yell in moments of crisis, what are they trying? Choices: A: guide children B C Control Children D: Vent Anger  E : Care for Children<n><n>Initiation: 1.The verbs "trying" and "yell" are both active verbs, which tells us to look for an active phrase.<n>2. "Moments" is present in the sentence, so "moments of crisis" is a phrase.<n>3. "Moments of crisis" indicates that the situation must be somewhat chaotic and may also involve some kind of emergency or danger.<n>4. Choice A: guide children is not appropriate for the description of a phrase, because it is not related to the situation of a moment of crisis. The phrase is asking us to find a word for an action that parents perform in moments of crisis, so it is not the correct answer.<n>5. Choice B - parents want to control their children, is not the right answer either.<n>6. Choice C - parents try to control their children, also doesn't fit the requirement of the sentence.<n>7. Choice D - "control children" is the phrase we are looking for, so this is the correct answer.

The question requires a more rational feeling than that of anger as anger usually provokes a violent response and that wouldn’t help much with the lawsuit unless it’s an argument to sue a partner or family member.<n>| D: trial | <n>It’s possible that trying and failing to make a point might make the person consider instituting suit. As an example, a person may try to plead the case for a wrongfully closed bakery and get turned away. They could then sue the local government.<n>But this isn’t all the person does, they also have to go to trial, and it’s the trial that this option applies to. <n>| E: court case | <n>This option is correct. The use of case implies that the situation that’s happening is an instance of the problem. <n>Therefore, the correct answer to this question is E: court case.

The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:The family was playing cards, what would be a reason for this?

The questions asks about (what) as a word or a common item. 3. The sentence needs an item that can be eaten for lunch and isn't so specific as to mention a particular type of food or ingredient. 4. The third option, 'bread', isn't really a food that can be eaten, as its texture is quite hard, and it's usually served with other food items on it. 5. The fourth choice, 'burger', is a common food item, but it's not the only thing that can be served for lunch, and it's specific to only hamburgers. 6. The fifth choice, 'chicken', is also eaten for lunch, although it is more commonly found in an open chicken sandwich. 7. The sixth option, 'Bread', is used as an ingredient to add bulk to other food items and can be found in a number of different dishes. 8. The seventh option, 'fish', is used as an item in a number of different cuisines but is less commonly eated for lunch. 9. The eighth option, 'hamburger', is eaten for lunch in many parts of the world, but it's less common or unavailable in some areas. 10. The ninth option, 'hot dog', is a common street food in certain countries and can be added to a bun for lunch. 11. The tenth option, 'ham', is used as an added ingredient in many different types of sandwiches, but it can also be eaten in its own right, and it's not restricted to any particular regional cuisine. 12. The eleventh choice, 'hammock', is an alternative for lunch, as it's used by people who choose to have a picnic or take a break from work.

We need to provide the location of 'the name'.<n>3. We can discard choice A: front of a plane because it is not a place.<n>4. There is no 'person' on top of a tree so option D: beside a person does not refer to a location.<n>5. Choice B: top of a tree means that we write our name at the top of a tree, not on top of a tree. Therefore option B: top of a mountain is incorrect.<n>6. We also can’t write our name on top of a book because it isn’t a place either.<n>7. Therefore option C: top of the tree is the only viable option.<n>8. Hence, option C: top of a tree is correct.<n>

Choices:  A: perfume B: air C: fountain D: swamp E: puddle<n><n>### Response:		<n>* Rationales:*<n>1. Firstly, we don’t know what the woman in the sentence is referring to.<n>2. The first four options, A: pernfome, B: air, C: fountain and D: swamp are not what the woman is referring to.<n>3. 'Spray' in the question is referring to using a spray bottle and the smell is referring to the odour from perfume.<n>4. Now the question is asking what the woman prefers, when she has both options available.<n>5. The first four options are 'A': perfume, 'B': air, 'C': fountain, and 'D': swamp, which are all good perfumes or places to spray perfume, except spraying air with perfume is probably rather senseless.<n>6. So the last option 'E: puddle' is the answer that fits the question and context, as it contains water and is also a good alternative place to spray perfume.<n>7.

Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:They took a break from all the rides to have lunch, while eating hamburger they talked about how they were going to what on the next ride? Choices:  A: heartburn B: have fun C: enjoy D: gas E: food poisoning<n><n>### Response:		Answer: A: heartburn<n><n>### Explanation:<n>From the previous questions, you have learnt how to use the word "which" to replace a pronoun that can be replaced by a pronoun and is followed by a preposition. <n>We can see from the instruction that we have to "reply with a choice of verb that fits the context". The verb we insert fits within the preposition followed by a pronoun. <n>The sentence reads:<n><n>> I want to know where/which are the best hiking trails in the area.<n>This could be interpreted as either where or which. Both "where" and "which" could be pronouns, and both "are" could follow "which" and "where". <n>Therefore, the above example of use "where" would mean which are the hiking trails while the use of "which" would mean where are the hiking tracks. <n><n>### However, there is a little tricky difference between these two usages of "which" in the instruction. The first use of "which" is when you are looking for a specific thing or piece of information. <n>If, from the sentence, the subject could be "best", then that "best" would mean it's referring to the "best" hiking trails or tracks. <n>So, "which" would not need a subject because "best" would already be the subject. Therefore, the sentence would be:<n><n>> Where are the best hikng trails in the area?<n>Thus, following the sentence, you would choose the choice that fits the subject and the context. The context here would be "best".<n><n>In contrast, the case when there is not a subject, it will be "where". <n>You can't have "which" when the subject isn't present. In these instances, the sentence would have been:<n><n>> Where is the best hiking trail in the area?<n>From the above sentences, we have understood how to use the word" which" in a sentence. The sentence structure will be: "Where are [subject]?" <n><n>So, it can be said that from "where", "which" is selected when "best" is the subject and "which" is selected <n>when "best hiking trail" is the subject.<n>Thus, it is important to understand

Choices:  A: pharmacy B: person C: drugstore D: bedroom E: mcdonalds<n><n>### Response:		The only place that fits the need specified by the question is C:drugstore. The sentence explicitly states that the contraceptive device does not need a prescription when purchased: "without a prescription." Therefore, the only place where one can purchase a contraceptive without a prescription is C: drugstore. If it did not require a prescription, one could presumably purchase it outside the drugstore and elsewhere. The sentence also states that the object is a device, implying that it must be man-made, and not an organic body part. Hence, option E: McDonald’s is ruled out. In addition, there is the implication that the purchase will involve an exchange of money for goods or services. Hence, a McDonald’s is not the right answer to the question. The person is not required in option B: person, as it does not require the purchase to be performed by a person alone, and it need not be done by the person who needs the device. Hence, this option can be eliminated. Similarly, option A: pharmacy can be eliminated on the basis that although there is the facility, it is not necessary to perform the purchase there. <n><n>### Demostration:<n>Answer: C: drugstore<n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where do  you park in the parking lot with shopping bags? Choices:  A: amusement park B: urban area C: airport D: shopping malls E: train station<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: A park with shopping bags <n>The sentence could be rewriten as : <n>I always park my bike with shopping bags in the parking lot of the train station.<n><n>1. Where asks for a location.<n>2. You (person) park asks for the action parked which is done in the parking lot.<n>3. Shopping bags is a location too. <n><n>### Input : Where does your father work? Choices: <n>A: on the farm B: in the office C: at the train station D: in the field E: in a factory<n><n>### Response :<n>Answer : C:at the train station<n>The sentence could be written as : My father works in the train station at the city.<n><n>The sentence is in the present tense, so we need to use the present tense for the answer.<n><n>1.Where asks for a place<n>2.The pronouns "your" are used to refer to a specific person/personal pronouns, so we know the person is not the answer. Hence, the answer will be a location<n>3.Father is a personal pronoun and work is a verb, so  the verb should come after the personal pronoun.<n>4.Father works with the pronoun your, so a preposition needed.<n>5.Father works in (the) train station works<n>6.The answer should reflect the verb -work which means the answer should be "in the train station"<n>7."Work" should precede the location "the train station", since "the train station" is a noun and does not take the preposition in.<n>8.The answer is D: a factory.<n><n>### Input  : Where does your mother park the car? Choices:   A: under the garage B: in front of the house C: at the gas station D: across the street E: on the street <n><n>### Response<n>Answer : C: At the gas station<n>The sentence couldbe written as :<n>Your mother parks the car at the gas station when she buys petrol.

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:If you're standing in line and the line isn't moving what might you feel? Choices:  A: order B: queueing up C: wait turn D: fatigue E: anger<n><n>### Response:		It appears that option A: Order is not suitable because the sentence does not ask for an opinion.<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The question asks about an emotion rather than a physical movement or the quality of the process by which we get order.<n><n>2. The expression is also used to describe the social order in which people are considered equal, regardless of their position in society. Therefore, 'order' is too broad in meaning and doesn't fit in the sentence. <n><n>3. Option B: queue is commonly associated with a line of people waiting patiently to purchase products or utilize resources in a timely, orderly fashion. Thus, it is the most probable choice that fits the context of the question. <n><n>4. However, the term 'queueing up' (the formation of a line to purchase or use a service ) does not fit the context of the question and the sentence structure. Since, 'queue' is a noun, and the sentence requires an adjective. Additionally, the first word, 'line', is an adjective as the second,'moving', indicates a physical movement. Hence, the correct answer is option B: queue. <n>5. Option C: wait turn is not suitable because the first two words are a passive form of 'to wait' and thus don't directly answer our question. The word 'line' is not an option as the sentence is about the emotion while taking time to answer. Thus, 'wait turn' doesn't fit the context of the sentence and the structure of the sentence does not match up with the required answer. <n><n>6. Option D: fatigue is not suitable since it is not a feeling or emotion and does not describe the situation where someone stands in line. It is also very broad in meaning and could fit a variety of situations. The sentence and the question are more narrow in scope than the general meaning.<n><n>7. Option E: anger is not suitable, as the question doesn't suggest any reasons for anger or any conditions which cause it. Hence, 'anger' is not the correct answer. <n><n>### Answer:  B: Queue<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following question.<n><n>## Questions Asked:<n><n># What are you doing?

Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:If I wanted to store dirt in my home, where could I put it? Choices:  A: fingernails B: garden C: corner D: computer E: closet<n><n>### Response:		Correct option:- E: closet<n>### Reason:1. The question suggests that the storage solution can’t be found in a place related to dirt.<n>2. Closet is not a place typically related to dirt. That's why it is the right answer.<n>### Choice-A: We wouldn't store dirt in our fingernails, as fingernails are not made for storage and also we don't consider dirt part of our fingernails.<n>### Choicce-B : A garden is a place full of plants and flowers and it can’t be used to store something as toxic as dirt.<n>### Choices-C : It’s not an area with corners, let alone a place filled with dirt.<n>##2. Choices-D: Storage space on computers is small and it won’t be easy to find a suitable place there either.<n>### Choise-E- It is possible to keep dusty clothes in a closet but not dirt as it may cause a health hazard, therefore closet is not a place to put dirt.<n><n>---<n>

Choices:  A: cross street B: milk cow C: lose weight D: step forward E: need food<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The sentence first asks a question- Would, and then answers it with a yes and no question.<n>2. The meaning of the sentence is ‘Will a volunteer do this task?’<n><n>### The four options are:<n><n>### Option A: cross street- <n>this does not suit the given rationale, as <n>### Option B: milk cow- Milk a cow can’t be done by a volunteer so, this also doesn’t suit the context of the given rationale.<n><n>### Option C: lose weight- Volunteer is not a noun to which a verb with ‘will lose weight’ can be applied. So, ‘will lose weight’ doesn’t make sense, the context doesn’t make sense.<n><n>### Next option is E: need food- The last option, E: need food, is a sentence, and doesn’t suit the format of the question.<n><n>## Option D: step forward<n>In the question, the sentence first asks a yes/no question, then the option is a question in the same format.<n>

Choices:  A: actions B: legal C: authentic D: logical E: legitimate<n><n>### Response:		Choices:  A: authentic B: logical C: legitimate D: real E: correct<n><n>Rationales:1. The options beginning with A: and B: are not correct because the sentences beginning with a pronoun (a pronoun is an indefinite pronoun used in place of a noun or a noun phrase) is followed by a verb, not an adjective or noun.<n>2. The sentence is asking us what kind of certificate a handbag will have, we cannot put a noun phrase that doesn't have the required grammatical function in our response.<n>3. This question is not asking about the contents of what the certificate states but about the certificate itself which is the what clause so we need a preposition as a response.<n><n>4. That’s why'real' and 'correct' are not correct answers.<n>5. Finally, the answer is D: legitimate.<n>6. This means the handbag will not have a piece of paper that states the handbag is legitimate.<n>6  - A legitimate handbag is one that is authentic, not a forgery.<n><n>### Input :Why is the earth always spinning?

'A' and 'B' : <n>The answer must state that the earth is always spinning.<n><n>2. 'C' : <n>'Away from the sun' is a prepositional phrase and cannot be used because to answer the question we need a verb phrase for this sentence.<n><n>3. 'D' and 'E' : <n>'By the sun' means that the earth is always facing the sun, i.e. spinning away from the sun. It is the opposite of 'Under the sun' which indicates that the earth is facing away from the sun, i.e. spin-<n>ning away from the sun, hence they are correct.<n><n>The answer to this question is "B".<n><n>### Input Why is it dangerous to play in road?

Choices:  A: nebraska B: new york C: mexico D: home E: utah<n><n>### Response:		Input: Where can I find a steakhous with a view of cornfields? The correct choice is E: utah.<n>Explanation: <n>1. 'Ne' is a prefix meaning 'not', so we can immediately eliminate A: Nebraska. The word 'n'e'raska' means 'not Nebraska'.<n>2. Option 'B: New York ', the second choice refers to 'a town in New York'. The sentence requires an answer that indicates a direction, not a city name.<n>3. Option C: Mexico is used to refer to a country. So, it does not fit the criterion of a direction of a steakhouse.<n>4. Option 'D: home ', while referring to a 'place to rest', it does not convey a direction.<n>5. Option 'E: Utah ', is a US state, and also can mean a place to rest.<n>6. Consequently, option E: Utah is the only choice that corresponds to the information asked.<n>7. Therefore the answer is E: Utah.<n><n>### Input:"I can’t wait for you to get home this evening, we have a lot of catching up to do." Choices:  A. A lot to catch up on  B. A lot catching up  C. A lot to catching up  D. A lot to catch  E. A lot catch<n>Rationales:<n><n>1. First of all, we know it must be 'a lot of catching up'.<n>2. Choice A: a lot to catch up on, can't be the choice. It is not in the correct word order.<n>3. Choice B: a lot catching up, can't be either. It doesn't match the structure required.<n>4. Choice C: a lot to catching up, is also wrong. It doesn't maintain the correct word order. 'to' isn't used in the correct place..<n>5. Choice D: a lot to catch, isn't the chosen structure. To match the grammatical structure of the sentence, 'to' should be used after 'catch'. The word is 'to catch', not 'catch'.<n>6. Choice E: a lot catch, is grammatically correct, but it's not the correct choice either, it is incorrect, as it doesn't convey the idea

The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:How can a person end up stopping standing in  puddle? Choices:  A: move away from B: laying in C: sweating D: movement E: walking out of<n><n>### Response:		E: walking out of<n>### Rationals:<n>1. The question requires that we explain how one can finish standing in a puddle, so it’s asking us to suggest a way to move from a position in a puddled to a position somewhere else.<n><n>### 2. The first word “How,” tells us that it’s going to be a question.<n><n>## Input: I have made the table for you. Choices: A: a little thing B: piece of table C: the table D: some things E: some things<n>Rationals: 1. The verb phrase “made the table,” indicates that we made the entire table, so the answer requires an object that denotes the entire table.<n><n>## Response: C: the table<n>## Rationals: 1.”The table” refers specifically to the entire table, not just a piece of it, so this answer correctly reflects that the entire table was made. 2. Though it’s a table, “made the table” doesn’t refer to pieces of table, so the first option, “a little thing,” can’t be correct. Similarly, “piece of table” is a noun phrase, and we're not looking for a noun phrase. 3. Because “made the table” refers to the entire table, the second option, “the table,” fits perfectly. 4. "some things" refers to items in a table, and "some things" here refer to some pieces of table, it can't be answer. 5. "some things” doesn't refer to the table itself, so it doesn't indicate that we made the entire thing. Therefore, option B: the table is a suitable answer.<n>

'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What would a person do if he or she just woke up?

The sentence asks what people can use to take the lead in small paper games.<n>2. The second choice, 'video game', only seems like it could answer the question, but it simply doesn't fit the sentence right, because while video games are often used to compete, they are not played in small papers.<n>3. The fourth option, 'card game', is a game that can be played in a small paper, so it's not a suitable choice.<n><n>### Rationale 4:<n>4. Next, the fifth choice, 'News article', appears to be the perfect fit for this situation. It is a piece of writing that can be used for people to take the lead when playing a game in a small paper. It includes a lead sentence or headline at the beginning and is appropriate for such a game. Thus, the answer to the question is C: news article.<n>5. Therefore, the correct answer is C: news article<n>

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n><n>### Response:		 A: Wilderness<n><n>### Rationales: 1."Where" initially tells us to think of a place that the subject of the sentence doesn’t go.<n>2. Although a Marmoset is a land mammal and could potentially live in a wilderness, the word choices used give us the impression that this is a place that the speaker of the sentence would not choose to go as well.<n>3. So option D: underground is incorrect as this could potentially be a place the Marmoset could live and also where the speaker could potentially choose to go.<n>4. The other options seem to be very specific, yet not entirely incorrect as they could potentially be places that a Marmoset could live or that a human speaker could choose to go.<n>5. However, for the purposes of the argument, it is enough for the choices to be places that the Marmoset could not live in or that the speaker does not choose to go to.<n>6. And since the speaker of the sentence isn’t a Marmoset, it makes more sense that they would choose to avoid those places where the Marmoset does not typically live or go.<n>7. Therefore the answer is E: Colorado.<n>8. The speaker may choose to visit the Colorado region, as it is a marvelous tourist destination, but it is not a good place for a Marmoset to live, or one that the Marmoset would typically go to.<n><n>### Input : Where do you get most of your energy from?

Choices:  A: building B: office C: library D: table E: bathtub<n><n>### Response:		The bathtub can be referred to as a side chair; it has four legs and is made of ceramic just as the actual chair. So, the bathtub functions as a chair, and hence it can be put in place of the bat.<n><n>### Rationales: 1."I wanted" indicates that I want to use a side chair somewhere; hence I will have it put somewhere. <n>2. "Where," here, indicates that the answer requires a place.

It should also be some kind of a site that is typically associated with sitting down or sitting around. <n>3. The options which can’t answer the given question are: Option A: building because the question asked about a side chair.<n>Option E: bathtub, as the question asked about a bathtub, not a side chair.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:She had a knack for entertaining, everybody told he she had a what? Choices:  A: fun B: talent C: learn about D: intelligence E: recognize<n><n>### Response:		C:learn about, She had a knack for learn about, everybody told he she,She learnt about in class.<n><n>### Demo:<n>Input: She had a knack of what? Choices: A: learning English B: learn English C: learn about D learn English E: speak English<n>Rationales:<n>1. The sentence begins with She and then it says She had a knack, which denotes possession. So She must be possessing a noun.<n>2. The sentence then goes on to say for what.<n>3. A knack can be defined as a natural ability in a person. It can also be referred to as an excellent talent.<n>4. Therefore it should be a noun.<n>5. The question is essentially asking for the noun possessed by the subject of the verb had. But the sentence is too short it only contains an auxiliary word, a subject, and a gerund (learn).<n>6. Looking at the possible answers A: learning English B. learn English these do not form complete sentence.<n>7. So eliminating these choices<n>8. Finally we are left with Choice C: learn about.<n>9. It is referring to how to use a verb that is a gerund. The word learn is a verb which is a gerund here.<n><n>10. Therefore I will input C: learn about into the system.<n>

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Dave put his beer where he could get to it, but it would be off the floor.  Where did he put it? Choices:  A: refrigerator B: closet C: can D: shelf E: soccer game<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Dave put his beers into the cupboard, which he could then grab later.   <n><n>### Question:<n>> What did Dave do?<n>    <n>### Demontration:<n>1. The sentence asks 'where did he put it?', so we can only put a location, not a noun like beer or can.<n>2. The choices available are<n>   1.'refrigerator' : we don't have more than one of these. However, a refrigerator can contain food or drink.<n>   2. 'can' : a can of beer is a beverage. we can't just randomly use it anywhere.<n>   3.'shelf' : we can use the word'shelf' for anything that is placed on it. but in this sentence, shelf was used to refer to where we can put something.<n>   4.'soccer game' : in this context, it is a noun, and we don't know where the noun is so it cannot fit.<n>3. 'Cupboard' : cupboard is a place where we can keep things, that is a place we can put something. so it is correct.<n>   4. Therefore, the answer to the question "What did dave do?' is B: put cups in a cupboard<n><n>### Input : The students were asked to write a report.

The question refers to the type of sound humans make during sleep.<n>2.	All the answer choices refer to something that is done or experienced in humans in relation to sleeping.<n>3.	Humans don’t make any sound during sleep.<n>4.	Hence, the only choice that is correct in this case is D- Dreaming.<n>5.	So, A is a wrong answer.<n>6.	Next, C is not a correct answer, for the simple reason that humans don’t actually snore while sleeping.<n>7.	Again, the letter D is correct.<n>8.	E is also incorrect as we rarely talk during sleep.<n><n>### Answer:<n>Humans Make No sound while sleeping.<n><n>### Raison:<n>1.	The verb in the sentence is “make“.<n>2.	The answer choices are verbs such as “sleep“, “lose”, “relax”, “talk” or “dreame” <n>3.

The preposition “on” in the sentence requires that we identify the noun to be used in place of “on”.<n>2.	The meaning of the sentence suggests that a caravan is usually traveling “On the road”, and that the caravan has some ability to move on the road.<n>3.	The sentence could have been “What does a caravan look like?”, but in this case, we need to identify the noun that the preposition requires.<n>4.	The first option, “sleep”, could not be used here because it does not reflect the correct position of the caravan.<n>5.	Secondly, the option” loss”, could be used properly because the caravan “loses” sleep while on the road.<n>6.	The third option, “lose”, could have been properly used if the sentence said “What does a caravans lose while on the road?”, and not, “What does a caraven do on the

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by many people recently? Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>Several decades ago, when people's expectations in life were low, the atmosphere was clean. So that was the place that people could only find that. With the development and improvement of technology, more and more people begin to be conscious of protecting the environment. They have the feeling that "the world is getting lonelier". Many people begin to find the natural atmosphere pollution-free scenery is becoming more and more rare. Since then, more and more people start to buy air cleaners. They have tried to make use of every possible and possible ways to get cleaner air. They want to spend the rest of their lives in a comfortable and beautiful house surrounded by a clean and fresh air. As many houses in Beijing are newly designed and people buy a lot of cleaners, air could be found in many places: apartment, office, kindergarten, and even in a shopping mall. Therefore, we could find that the place people could find air that has been "breathed by many people recently" is "all over the city".<n><n>### Rationales: <n>1.  The sentence in the instruction asks us to describe a place where we could find air that has "been breathed by many people", but our options are 'house','space shuttle', 'air', 'air shuttle', and'surface of earth'. It is clear that these options do not describe the place.<n><n>2.    In the instruction, it says that we should find a place where we could get air that has been "beathed by many people recently".  We should find a place that has been breathed. Since human breathing is a natural phenomenon, this refers to the atmosphere. Therefore, we can rule out option A: charming that does not refer to the atmosphere and option B: space shuttles that is a craft spacecraft, not referring to the atmosphere. <n><n>3.   Therefore, we can rule the options C: house and D: train station because the question refers to the atmosphere that has been breathed recently and therefore the context that the air came from and the time that the air was breathed are the key factors.<n><n>4.   The options E: surface of earth do not make sense. First, since the question mentions atmospheric air, the option E: surface o earth cannot make sense. Second, we can assume that the air here refers to the earth

Choices:  A: ungulate B: bomber C: body armor D: tank E: hat<n><n>### Response:		<n>Body armor<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. "Protect themselves from a cannon" initially tells us that they need some form of protection to keep themselves safe.<n>2. The implications of "what" suggest that the answer can't be a person (as "what" would be more appropriate for a thing or concept).<n>3. We can immediately rule options A: ungulate and C: body armor. Ungulates aren't used to protect against cannons, and body armor isn't even an appropriate response to the question.<n>4. We also eliminate option E: hat since a hat doesn't offer protection from a cannon.<n>5. We rule out options A: bomber and B: tank since, the questions doesn't provide any context for why one would need "body armor."<n>6. Finally, we can conclude that the intended answer is D: tank.<n>7. Option D: tank is what would be worn to protect oneself from a cannon due to the fact that tanks are able to deflect large projectiles, making them protective against cannons.

Choices:  A: manipulate B: charming C: deceive D: exaggerate E: incompetent<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:<n>1. "to gain her trust the real-estate agent was very polite" - The sentence is a passive one (e.g. in the passive voice "The real-estate agent" is the verb and "was very polite" is the object.<n>2. Therefore, the answer needs to be a verb or a verb phrase that fits into the passive structure, or at least is a form or "to be" (is, are, am, was, were, been, are going to be).<n>3. The first two options, B and C, do not fit the passive structure.<n>4. Option A: "manipulate" may describe how the real-estate agents acted, but it is a transitive verb (e.g. "Sally manipulates her husband with kind gestures", "Sally manipulatives her husband with kind gestuers).<n>5. Option D: "exaggerate" is a word that refers to "to speak with more energy or volume than is natural and intended". It is a transitive verb not a passive verb.<n>6. Only option E, "incompetent", is a passive verb phrase in the passive voice that is of a form "to be" (e.g. I am incompetent, I am getting incompetent, we were incompetent) that describes the agent's behaviour.<n>7. So, the answer is E, "incompentent".<n>Answer: E: incompetence (E: incompentence?)<n><n>### Input - Why did they close the store? Choices: 1. A: the business failed 2. B: the place had burned down 3. C: thieves had robbed the place 4. D: there was heavy rain 5. E: it had lost money<n><n>### Response<n>Rationales: - Input: "why" - The sentence is asking for a reason why the store was closed<n>- Input: "closed the store" -> The store was closed. The sentence is asking for the reason the store was closed. Therefore, the answer should be related to that.<n>- Choice C - The answer describes the consequence of the place having to close -> not relevant.<n>- Choice E - The answer describes an objective circumstance -> not relevant.

"Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What corner areas have lots of windows? Choices:  A: wall B: office C: space shuttle D: front door E: tent<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer would be'space shuttle'.<n>### Rationales:  When a question wants us to describe or list possible outcomes, then it usually specifies which elements are to be included in the list. For example: 'Where are the apples? They went to the following places.'<n>1. From the sentence "lot of windows" we can see that the person is looking for a physical place that has lots of windows rather than lots of apps, which the first option A: wall clearly rules out.<n>2. The second option C: space shuttles is a bit tricky, since it seems to be a correct answer because it has lots of panels that are known as windows in space shuttles.<n>3. But the person probably means windows that are commonly found in houses.<n>4. So, the person probably means that we see lots of windows when we go to space stations like the ISS where astronauts work and live.<n>5. And so the correct answer would be 'Space Shuttle'.<n><n>### Input : Where do they live? Choices: 1. A: aunt B: uncle C: mom D: dad E: grandpa<n>Rationales:<n>1. The question is asking where the child lives. But the child (2nd person singular) is assumed to refer to a specific kid. In this case, it is the child who lives with the grandma (3rd person pronoun).<n>2. So, the correct answer would be A: Aunt<n><n>### Input How do you make ice cream? Choices: <n>1. A: scoop ice cream<n>2. B: make vanilla syrup<n>3. C: mix ingredients<n>4. D: blend sugar<n>5. E: make cream<n><n>### Response <n>The correct answer would D.<n>### Rationals :<n><n>The first and last options are wrong because a syrup is added to ice-cream whereas we are trying to explain how to make ice-cream.<n>Since we are making ice-cream it should be made with the ingredients and mix them together using an electric machine.<n>In the middle, options are correct but a little bit complicated hence the last sentence.<n><n>### Input Where do cars park in the mall?

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1.

Choices:  A: airport B: car C: jewelry store D: garbage can E: laundry room<n><n>### Response:		A: airport<n><n>### Rationale:1. A person would take a large netted bag to an airport, perhaps for putting their luggage into. <n>2. So, there is no reason to choose the word that isn't related to an airport.<n>3. A person would not normally pack their luggage or take a large nettined bag to their airport in this way. <n>4. If you were to use your netted drawstring for the purpose of packing your belongings for the trip to your airport, that would be inappropriate. <n>5. The first choice is C: jewelery store. <n>6. In a jewelry store, you wear your jewelry and you go to take a small bag. You won't be carrying a large drawstring bag. <n>7. Therefore, B: "airport" is the only possible option to the answer to the question.<n><n>## 3.

Loose fit clothing does not meet that standard. When it comes to business attire, our clothing should be well ironed, neat and tidy, and should have no defects. A business t-shirt or jacket combined with black slacks or a skirt would be the most suitable casual clothing worn in an office meeting. <n><n>## 4.

Instead, you're going to burn off the energy you accumulated, either through exercise or by eating food. So, we eliminate this option as well.<n><n>5: Option C: is incorrect too, as being tired is not a consequence of exercising. It's an indication of being too tired to exercise.<n>6: Also, this option does not answer the question.<n><n>7: Next<n><n>7: Next, we look at option D: muscle weakening.

Choices:  A: dry hair B: spreading C: blowing hard D: change direction E: wave wheat<n><n>### Response:		<n>The term, tore, indicates that the wind was spreading over the surface.<n><n>Rationale: 1. The first choice, dry hair, refers to a style of hair. A wind doesn’t dry hair.<n>2. The second choice, spreading, is a suitable choice, as it indicates that the wind was moving in a way that spread it over the surface.<n>3. The third choice, blowing hard, means that the wind was moving fast and continuously. However, since the sentence says that the wind tore off something, the wind clearly wasn’t blowing fast and continuously.<n>4. The fourth choice, change of direction, indicates that the wind direction changed at some point. According to the context, this is incorrect because the sentence states the wind blew in a certain direction, which means that the direction didn’t change.<n>5. The last choice, wave wheat, also doesn’t make sense. Waves are created by sea water that flows back and forth, so a wind can’t be compared to waves of water.<n>6. Therefore, the most suitable answer is B: spreading.

Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:If there is a stale smell in the air coming from the kitchen, what should one check for the source of the smell? Choices:  A: bathroom B: house C: cupboard D: space shuttle E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		What is the source of the smelling? Choices: <n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: I was feeling a little under the weather. Choices:  A&B: 1. A: understated 2. B: overweight 3. C: on the floor 4. D: high temperature 5. E: on a bumpy road<n>Rational: 1. The first four options are all choices that describe the speaker’s condition, but “under” describes the current situation that he is not feeling well.<n>2. Then, “over” means overweight, so it is not suitable.<n>3. Similarly, “out”, another expression that means same as “under”, cannot be suitable because it is the under situation that he is feeling poor.<n>4. “On the floor” does not help answer the question at all, because the speaker is not lying on the floor, as it has nothing to do with the current situation.<n>5. Finally, “high” means high temperature. The speaker in this sentence might be feeling a little sick so that he feels hot. Therefore, option D is the correct choice: “a little under the temperature”.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>### Answer<n>A: B:<n>B:A:<n><n>### Demote:<n><n>### Response<n><n><n>### Answer to question: <n># The sentence is "The question was 'what do you think was the best idea?'.". What do you think was the  best idea? <n><n>### Answer <n># The question was "what do you think was best idea?". The idea is the best among the different answers for a question.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

The question 'Where are the windows in a flight kept?' is asking about the physical location of the windows in the plane.<n>2.  Option 1, 'outside', is incorrect because a plane is not an object that is outside.<n>3.  Option 2, 'in space', is outside the scope of the question and doesn't answer the query.<n>4.  Option 3, 'in the clouds', is not a suitable place for a window.<n>5.  Option 4, 'near the doors', is also incorrect because the doors of a plane are not near the windows.<n>6.

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:How would someone feel after going for run? Choices:  A: working out B: sore C: get tired D: satisfaction E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Instructions:The answer to these questions will depend on the choice of the sentence.<n>### Demonstion:<n><n>### Input<n><n>    I feel:<n>a)  _______ ____<n>After I exercise every day.<n><n>### Response<n><n>    D, satisfied.<n><n>### Input <n>        I think of my mother as:<n>a) ____ when I am in her company or when I think of her.<n><n>###  Response <n>        "in my thoughts"<n><n>### Instution:The answer to each question will depend on your choice.<n><n>### Demo:<n>Input: I think of my mother: <n>Choices: A: as a child with a childB: like a child with a childC: as a child with children D: to be like a child with children E: when I am with my children.<n>Rationales:<n>1. The first option, A, would be correct if one answered that they think of their mother as a child when they were children.<n>2. In the same way, one would think of their mothers as childish whenever they behave childishly.<n>3. The third option, C, would be correct if they would consider their mother to be childish in some other situation than when they or their mother are children.<n>4. This question is about how one sees their mother, and only the first part of the sentence is relevant.<n>5. Hence, the answer has to be either A, which is the correct choice, or E, which can be considered the logical conclusion of the entire sentence.<n>Answer: A: as a Child or B: like a Child<n><n>### Demo<n>Input: We are so glad our parents came <n>Choices:A: when they didB: for coming with usC: even it’s not enoughD: when when they didn’tE: after they came.<n>Rationales<n>1.The first option, A, is inappropriate since it is a statement that describes how one is feeling and doesn’t reflect how they perceive their parents.<n>2. The second option, B, would be more appropriate if describing how one perceives one's parents.<n>3. The sentence explicitly asks how one is feeling about their parents' absence, so the only appropriate answer is C.<n>4. The correct answer here

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8.

Choices:  A: excellent B: fun C: honest D: worthy E: choice<n><n>### Response:		The sentence asks for a suitable adjective word that is positive in meaning and describes Mary.<n><n>### Rationales:1. The first option, "excellent", is a positive adjective, so you could technically say that the sentence is correct.<n>2. However, this sentence cannot be correct, since Mary was indeed a "bad" girl.<n>3. Furthermore, "excellent" does not have a close association with the rest of the sentence, and would be an unusual adjective to use here.<n>4. Hence, it is not a suitable choice.<n><n>### The last choice, 'choice', is not a suitable adjective because it is a noun, and adjectives (including articles) must come before the noun.<n><n>5. So, therefore, the only choice that can be a suitable adjective and matches the tone of the sentence is the second one, 'fun'.<n><n>Answer: F: fun<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where can you see a mammoth in NYC? Choices:  A: refrigerator B: museum exhibit C: prehistoric times D: museum of natural history E: forest<n><n>### Response:		 We usually think of mammoths as being relics of prehistoric times. But a large-scale reconstruction mammoth, called ‘Colossal’, has been on exhibit at New York City’s American Museum of Natural History since 17,500 B.C, with additional large-scale reconstruction exhibits dating to 20,000 B.C. and 12,000 B.,C. In its Hall of North American mammals, Colossal is flanked by other prehistoric animals, such as saber-toothed cats, dire wolves, and giant ground sloths, as it roams the 3,600-square-foot space.<n><n>### Rationales: 1."Where" initializes us to a location.<n>2."You" is the subject.<n>3."See" is a verb indicating an action.<n>4."Mammoth" is the direct object of the action<n>5."In" locates the mammoth (direct object) within a given area.<n><n>Rating: "Very Hard"<n><n>Score:69

Choices:  A: like more B: nodding C: by wearing rings D: concordance E: shake hands<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: by wearing rings B: nodding C nodding D: wearing rings E: shake hands <n><n>The term 'concordance' means agreement/assent, whereas 'nodding' means bobbing one’s head slightly forwards and back again.<n><n>'Nodding' can be used to indicate agreement, and is also used to convey that the person knows the other person. You would nod with your head up, and your eyebrows raised/raised both together.<n><n>'wearing rings' refers to the use of rings as a symbol of marriage.<n><n>'shaking hands' is an act of greeting, in which both the palms of both hands are brought together, touching each other. It is the act of grasping another individual's hand in a way that indicates that you are pleased to see the other person. The right hand is usually used for shaking hands.<n><n>From the options, 'nodding' (option B) can be used to indicate concordance, 'wearing rings' (option D) is out of place,'shake hands' is the only direct answer that can be used. So, our response is E:'shake hands'.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n>Choices are the same as previous instructions<n>Answers are same as previous instructions<n><n>### Insturctions:Choose the option that gives the correct part of speech for the highlighted part of the sentence.

Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:<n> 1. The question asks for how/why the man began to lose his ability to decipher the print, in other words, what did his experience lead to.<n> 2. The third choice, 'Happiness', doesn't describe any significant change to his ability to read, so we can immediately rule it out.<n> 3. We can rule out the second choice,'strain', as reading a lot of print can be difficult or cause strain, but it doesn't necessarily lead to realizing something about reading or cause him to understand the content.<n> 4. The option 'Thoughts' contains the word "thought", but "realized" is what the question asked for. So option C is out.<n> 5. The first option, "Eye strain", doesn't relate to anything he is suffering from but is merely a symptom of eye strain, so this option cannot be correct.<n>6. We know that the author means he is beginning to suffer the symptoms of eye strain so we'll look at the only choice left, 'Realization'.<n>Answer: D: realization<n><n>### Instructions:In a recent study conducted by a popular research institute, a link between high-sugar diets and diabetes was found.<n><n>### Rationale: <n>1.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:To prevent any glare during the big football game he made sure to clean the dust of his what?

The task is to pack or bag, and that's clearly an activity.<n>4. But what can be packed or bagged? The answer to this question is indicated by the use of the term 'food.'<n>5. 'Food' refers to the ingredients used to prepare meals, and 'food' has to be packed or bag before someone can cook it.<n><n>6. So, the phrase, 'Grab a match' fits very well into the structure of the sentence and also reflects the task of the camper, and is indeed the correct answer.<n><n>#### Question:<n>A camper needs to pack or bag before he/she can cook food.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>D : Grab the Match<n><n><n>### Instructions:Following Directions:<n><n><n><n>### Directions:<n>The diagram below shows four stages in the production of an apple pie.<n>1.

"The boy is really tall, <n>isn't he" has two adverbial modifiers and a main clause, The boy is really tall. The sentence is clear but sounds kind of exaggerated. 2. So, the most likely answer is the sentence written without any modifiers. 3. The boy is really tall sounds better than The boy is really tall? 4. When we don't want to ask a question, "isn't he?" is omitted.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Stanley had a dream that was very vivid and scary. He had trouble telling it from what? Choices:  A: reality B: imagination C: dreamworker D: nightmare E: awake<n><n>### Response:		The answer is C: Dreamworker.<n>Input: We had no choice but to buy some new shoes. <n>Choice: A: Buy new shoes B: Have no choice but to buy C: Buy new shoelaces D: Have no choice but E: To buy new shoelaces<n>Rationales:<n><n>#### 1. <n>"We had no (choice but to) buy some new shoes" is the dependent clause in the sentence. It begins with the word "We," which indicates that a group, rather than an individual, chose to buy some new shoels and thus needs a plural verb. "Had to" is the verb in this case. <n><n>It is easy to determine that B, C and E are incorrect since they do not begin with "We."<n><n>Since A is the subject and it is singular, the correct answer is B.<n><n>#### 2. <n>C refers to an object which "does not indicate a place."<n><n>The sentence is talking about an action taking place, as we can see from "buy some new shoels." This action is taking place where?<n><n>The correct answer is A because the action is taking place in a location.<n><n>#### 3. <n>B stands for a place and the sentence wants to describe an action that could be referring to shoes, which are definitely objects, rather than a place.<n><n>The sentence says "we had to" which indicates an imperative mood to describe the action.<n><n>The sentence is not talking about a place because it does not start with "we", which indicates that a plural person is talking about a plural action. Hence, the incorrect answers E, C and D are eliminated.<n><n>Hence, the answer is B, since we are buying some new shoes.<n><n>### Input 3: It was a great idea, although it was not a particularly easy one to see.<n><n>### Response<n><n>The sentence is asking what the idea was and how easy it was to see, rather than which word correctly follows it. <n><n>Since there is no word incorrectly used in the sentence, the answer is 'D: It would be hard to imagine anyone disagreeing with the statement that it was a great idea.'<n><n>Answer: D: It would be hard<n><n>### Instructions<n><n>Below is an instruction that describes the task

Choices:  A: demonstration B: conference C: building D: garage E: mouth<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: A: demonstration<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The sentence asks about a place where a person might live.<n>2. Option A: 'demonstration' is not a place but a demonstration is a place so it is good enough to describe a person's place of living.<n>3. Option B: 'conference' is not a suitable place as we do not stay in a conference.<n>4. 'Building' is the name of a structure. It is not a place where a person could stay because we move from living in a building.<n>5. Option D: 'garage' is not suitable as a living place.<n>6. Option E:'mouth' is an organ. It doesn't fit a person's home.<n>7. Consequently Option A: 'demoonstration' fits the sentence<n><n>### Instructions:Complete the dialogue with the appropriate filler word.<n>> He: How did you feel when you heard the news that your friend was going to marry the person you had thought was the most suitable partner for her? <n>> She: I thought that I was going to.<n>> He: But your friend's new partner isn’t suitable for her at all. <n>> She: When I first heard the news, I felt very shocked, but now I ________.<n>> He: Well, you know, you can't do anything about things like this, can you?<n><n><n>### Response<n>> A: dismayed<n><n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The first question asks how the speaker felt when she first heard the news.<n>2. The answer 'dismayed' is the only choice that reflects these feelings.<n>3. The following question asks how the speaker feels now as a result of the news.<n>4. 'Dismayed' fits here, too, 5. The last question asks what the speaker can do in this situation.<n>6. The only answer that reflects these feelings, 'dismayed', doesn't necessitate doing anything because the situation is out of the speaker's control.<n>7. Therefore the sentence suggests that the speaker feels 'disappointed'.<n><n>### Reference: <n><https://www.english-area.com/question/discussions-and-interviews-multiple-choice

Choices:  C: set table  D: present bill E: eat <n>Rationales:1. It is the last thing that happens when we end the meal.<n>2. We can immediately rule option A: serve food as it can't be a job of waiter as waiter serves food but doesn't end a meal.<n>3. Next option B: eat is not the job of waiter. He doesn't serve food so he can't 'eat' food.<n>4. Next option C: set table. Though waiter do set table at the end of meal. However, 'present bill' is also another job of waiter. As waiter present bill at the end of meals.<n>5. Finally option D: present bill is the response of waiter when end of meal finished.<n>6. Hence, by going though  steps we understand, 'present bill'  is the response of waiters <n>7. So, the answer is D: present bill.<n>Answer: D: present bill<n><n>Input: Do you like music?

"Cooked food is healthy to eat." or "cooking food is healthy" or "cooking foods are healthy"  is a ________ sentence.<n>Choices:<n>A: Yes/No Question B: Yes/No Sentence<n>4. What's the difference between the sentence, "He is going to school.” and the sentence, ”He is going to be school”?<n>A: In the first one,'school' is singular. So, the verb needs to be in the singular form.<n>5. In the second part of the second sentence,'school' is plural.<n>6. So, the verb 'to be' needs to be in

"Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Sally lost her kite because she wasn't careful.

Choices:  Option 1: A: people  B: place  C: nothing D: action <n>Rationales:1. The sentence initially asked: "What is there?"<n>2. The word "there" implies that the rest of the sentence describes the answer.<n>3. So it is an adjective to describe "there".<n>4. "people", the first option, could be describing a place, but not necessarily "there."<n>5. "a place" does not make sense here; this could be anything from a store to a car garage to a house.<n>6. So the word "a place" is not an answer.<n>7. Next is "nothing". "Nothing" is not a place either and so this answer is also incorrect.<n>8. The next option, "action", implies something is happening and it could be action happening "there."<n>9. So this is the correct answer.<n>Answer: Option 1: A; people<n><n>Input:Which is not correct? Choices:  "B" is wrong  "C" is wrong  "D" is wrong  "E" is wrong <n>Rationales:"B" could be "incorrect."<n><n>### Input :How do you get your car serviced?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>1.

The options which are not related that are 1,4,5,6, 7, 8, 9, 10.So, these are the correct options for the question.<n>    6. If the option 1, is asked how can this be done at the service station, the answer is A.<n>    7. So the options which are correct for this question are A and B.<n>    8. The option that is wrong is c.<n>    9. So if the question "How do you get a battery installed in the car?" Is asked for, the options are C, D, F, H, J.<n>    10.

Three fall off.  Now there are X apples."  What is this an example of? Choices:  A: park B: coloring book C: garden center D: math problem E: gravity<n><n>### Response:		C. <n><n>### Instructions : Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>### Instructor:<n>Input: The two trees that John is most familiar with are maple and beech trees.  The trees are in the forest by the stream. He is most familiar with beech trees because A: He has seen them before. B: He can see them from the kitchen window. C: They have a lot of yellow and brown leaves. D: They are a native tree.<n>Rationales:1. We use the word 'familiar' to describe how one 'knows' a thing, but only John 'knows' maple and beech.<n>2. So to get right answer we need to find a word that describes knowing.<n>3. The first thing John knows is "maple and beech". So that should be part of the answer. "Knows" indicates familiarity, that he was familiar with both trees. <n>4. The next part of the question is "they".<n>5. It's plural, not singular so the next noun needs to be plural as well.<n>6. "They have a lot of yellow, brown leaves" is a complete noun phrase so it needs to be plural, so it's not beech.<n>7. "native tree", doesn't make much sense either.<n>8. Only the two options are left: "He can see them from the window" and "They are a native tree."<n>9. So, option D, "native tree" is an incorrect response.<n>10. Since the only other choice left is option B, "He can see them"<n>11. Hence, the answer to the question is B: He can see<n><n>12. The sentence asks us how John knows maple and beech; but the sentence doesn't indicate whether he knows them by seeing, smelling, or touching.<n>13. We can immediately rule option A: saw them before, out.<n>14. Similarly, since maple and beech are not in his close proximity, option C "can see them from the kitchen", needs to be eliminated as well.<n>15. The question doesn't provide any indication as to whether he knows them through smell/touch.<n>16. Now let's discuss the 'window' part of the question.<n>1

'Alcoholic' means that Ben has a problem with alcohol and that he will always be associated with alcohol.  Anything is relative to alcoholism, just like alcohol.<n><n>### *Rationale B: <n>* 2. 'In an accident' means that Ben is always accidentally involved in things. <n><n>### * The question is asking where Ben was or was spending the 8 years in case of someone being in prison.<n>3. It has to be a permanent place that he is in. <n>The option A: prison is a perfect answer because it shows what happens to a convict.<n><n>### Rationale C: <n>* 4. 'Locked up' means someone who doesn't leave home or does it rarely for more than a few days.<n><n>### The answer to where he was must be D: Homeless shelter.<n>* 5. Homelessness is a state in which one does not have enough food and shelter and stays with friends or strangers or without a home for several days or years.<n>* 6.

We can tell we need to know what Sam preferred.<n>2. The sentence is telling us Sam didn't like to be around other people.<n>3. We can see that option A: you is out. <n><n>4. Option B: abbreviation can't be used in this sentence. <n><n>5. Option C: solitude can be used, but it doesn't make sense here. <n><n>6. Hence, the correct answer should be D: loneliness.<n>7.

Choice A: Flight and C: Flight may look similar because both of them have the same number of letters, but the first part is a different type of word than the second part.<n>3. The first part is a verb, which has a "y" ending, while the second part is a noun that has an "i" ending.<n>4. Hence, it seems obvious that these are not the same word.<n>5.

The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5.

The question wants us to understand how John categorizes people when they fail and win.<n>2. The options suggest why John likes competing.<n>3. We can eliminate option C because winners are not losers.<n>4. Option D indicates that wins determine who is competitive so losers are not competitors. <n>5. Option B indicates that winners may be competitive or losers may not be, both are possible. <n>6. Option E is impossible because the phrase “dividing into losers and competitors” gives the idea that to be competitive, you must belong to losing group and to be competitive you don’t belong to losing group. <n>7.

He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. The sentence requires we pick a place that fits the context of the sentence, and that Joe wants the ficus to look good in.<n><n>2. "Family Room" doesn't give a good reason why it would be chosen. If you wanted a ficus to look good, it depends on where you put it and what it's next to.<n><n>3. "Tropical Forest" doesn't fit either, not only because the sentence already mentioned a "Tropical Forest", Joe wouldn't want to display his ficus in that kind of setting.<n><n>4. "Flower Garden" is too literal. Joe is going to a flower garden to buy the plant, not bring it home as a ficus.<n><n>5. "Movie Theater" is way too big, doesn't make sense. Joe probably wouldn't wanna put the ficus in the movie theater.<n><n>6. "Hair Salon" doesn't fit because hair salons don't fit the context of buying a ficus, and it's too literal.<n><n>7. The answer that really fits the best is "Family Room", because this makes the most sense and it is the best choice.<n><n>### Answer: "Family Room"<n><n>### Input:"You can eat bananas anywhere."

The subject is "you", the person who doesn't have to go, so the predicate is "to the supermarket".<n>3. The second conditional will refer to the second reason why you shouldn't go to the supermarket.<n>4.

Meeting new people D. Getting somewhere E. Relocation<n>Rationales:<n>1. "getting somewhere" gives us the task of the sentence, which is to identify a location connected to an action verb (getting).<n>2. The four choices are: disorientation, due to, meeting, and relocation.<n>3. "Due to" is directly related to an action verb ("getting"). However, "due to" can mean "because of" (cause), so it's not the answer.<n>4. "Meeting new people" is a location, but it doesn't fit with the "getting" part of the sentence.<n>5. Choice "relocation" is another location, but it doesn’ t quite fit with “getting”.<n>6. Choice "disorientation" would mean "getting lost", and, according to the sentence, this would be because of "low visibility", which means "getting lost would be due to low visibility".<n>7. So, the correct answer is B. Due to.<n>Answer: B. Due to

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:How might a person address someone who is leaving? Choices:  A: further cause B: wave goodbye C: attempt suicide D: insulting them E: thank god<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is C: attempt suicide.<n><n>The first option, A: further cause, is not appropriate because this verb means to continue something, so it would not apply to a person who is leaving.<n><n>The second option, B: wave goodbye, would be considered an emotional or affectionate act, which is not typically done when someone is leaving.<n><n>Option D: insulting is a highly negative way to address someone, and it may not be the best choice when they are simply leaving.<n><n>The fourth option, E: thank god, is a prayer of gratitude to God for a positive occurrence, but would not be used to address someone who is leaving.<n>The fifth option,<n>is the correct option.<n><n>Answer: C, attempt suicide.<n>

Choices:  A: bite B: lie down C: keep alive D: need to eat E: go to sleep<n><n>### Response:		The answer is most likely to be choice C: Keep alive. <n><n>### Rationales: 1) The first option, 'bite', is a verb that refers to the way that some specific animals act when they are stressed. However, this would not necessarily be the way that all animals behave.<n>2) The second option, 'lie down', is a noun phrase that means to move into a horizontal position. It indicates relaxation, but does not specifically mention the behavior of animals, so it is not the best answer.<n>3) The term 'keep alive', the third choice, is a gerund phrase that means to continue to live, so it would be appropriate as the answer to this question.<n>4) The fourth option, 'need to eat', is a verb that means to require food or a certain amount of food. Although this could be true if an animal is tired, it is not necessarily the appropriate behavior to choose as the correct answer.<n>5) The fifth choice, 'go to sleep', is a verb phrase that means to fall asleep or to doze off. While it would not be inappropriate for an animal to choose to do this, it is not the correct choice for the answer to this particular question.<n>6) Therefore, the best answer is option 3: 'keep alive'.<n>   <n>### Input:Which sentence contains the best simile?

The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:When would you be able to see your reflection in a piece of wood?

Choices:  A: personal B: special C: shiny D: rare E: irregular<n><n>### Response:		The correct response is E: irregular.<n><n>#### Solution: <n><n>The sentence asks for the type of cards, and the first word of the answer should be similar to "a type of". <n><n>We can quickly eliminate the first option, "personal", as the whole premise of the sentence is that it is not personal cards. <n><n>The second option, "special", is an uncommon term used to describe a card in video games, such as "Legendary Pokemon" or "Holographic Pokemon", but it would not be appropriate in this context about a Pokemon card game. <n><n>The third option, "shiny," would not suit the answer either, as although it describes a particular Pokemon card with a specific detail, it does not fit the grammar structure of the sentence's answer. <n><n>The fourth option, "rare," is a common term describing the scarcity of certain items, but it does not provide specific information about the type of cards Bob thought were common and worthless. <n><n>Lastly, the fifth option, "irregular," perfectly fits the structure of the question. It is neither personal nor shiny or rare, and it does not contain any other meaning or context that contradicts the question. <n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is "irregular," and the answer choice that best explains the grammar and meaning of the sentence.<n><n>> If you like this tutorial or would like one done for you, consider dropping me a tip in the Support or the Tip Jar! 🙂<n><n><n><n>* �����������������**Your Support is greatly appreciated!**<n>* 🙏🏽❤️🙏𝟕​​​

Choices:  A: dress herself B: shower C: dress himself D: drink beer E: drive train<n><n>### Response:		B - shower<n><n>### Instructions:An adult man might start his day by getting ready. Write a response that completes the instructions<n><n>### Demand:This is what happens when you want to use'man' to refer to all genders.<n><n>### Explanation: <n>1. The phrase 'an adult man' in the sentence refers to both women and men.<n>2. The phrase then proceeds to say what such a person might do to get ready, namely'shower'.<n>3. This suggests that the person referred to in the sentence may be male or female. <n>4. So to answer the question, you should answer based on the gender of the person you think the sentence is referring to. <n>5. Although you might feel that you are being put in an awkward situation by this sentence, the best way to answer this question is to think of'man' as referring to both men and women. <n>6. This is because the sentence itself can't be interpreted as saying that only men or only women can shower. <n>7. So, the right answer to this question is B: shower. <n><n><n>### Instructor/Sage:<n>Here's a lesson in what one should not do. Answer: B - shower  <n><n><n>### Demotivation:<n>In English, there are many words that are used to refer to women, or girls or men or boys and it is important to use the correct word for the correct gender. In this piece of writing, the noun'man' has been used and we should understand that this refers to men only. And though this should be common knowledge, some of us do not use the correct words and that makes it sound extremely awkward and rude - if you were to address a girl as'man' in class, you would be considered to be a bad teacher/lecturer.<n>If you do not know which gender a person belongs to, just refer to them with the pronoun 'they' or 'their'. These words are plural but are used in place of singular nouns.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:I'm at a restaurant ans want a glass of milk, how do I find out if they serve that? Choices:  A: accompaniment to meal B: waitress C: cafeteria D: home E: menu<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct option for your response is C: Cafe D: Home for the following reasons.<n><n>#### I'm at a restaurant and want a glass of milk<n><n>The sentence is giving information about the subject, telling us that the subject is at a restaurant. Apart from that, the sentence is telling us the subject’s desire to have a glass of milk for his meal but doesn’t tell us the subject’s intention or plan.<n><n>#### How do I find out if They serve that?<n><n>The sentence is talking about the subject needing to inform how to find out whether they serve that (Milk). At this point, we still don’t know which they are, we should look at the options. <n><n>#### Choices: A: accompaniment to the meal, B: Waitress C: Cafeteria D: Home and E: Menu.<n><n>#### A: Accompaniment to meal: -<n><n>The correct answer to this sentence “ I'm at a restaurants and want a glass of Milk” would be “I’m Looking at a Waitress”. The answer would not be Accompaniment to the meal.<n><n>We all know the Milk is used as an accompaniment in meal. But the subject is not looking to find out Milk is the accompaniment to meal.<n><n>#### B: Waitress: -<n><n>The second choice, the correct answer would be “I’ve look at a Waitress”. A waitress is not involved in the situation.<n><n>One of the reasons why a waitress would be the answer is because she would be more likely to know where the Milk is available.<n><n>Since a cafeteria would be a good location where the Milk would be available in this sentence, a waitress would be working in the Cafeteria more often than the cafe.<n><n>Therefore, the Waitress would be the last choice.<n><n>#### C: Cafeterias: -<n><n>Cafeteria is the only choice in the options for this sentence as the first and second sentence clearly says that the subject is at the restaurant. <n><n>#### D: Home: -<n><n>The third option “ Home” Is more often known as the place for where a person lives. It would be more likely for the subject to have Milk at home than a restaurant.<n><n>#### E:

Choices:  A: automobile accidents B: backache C: eye strain D: getting tired E: car crash<n><n>### Response:		Answer: C: eye strain<n><n>### Justify:C: eye strain. The sentence is asking for what might happen after driving a car. E: car crash implies that you have crashed into another car. This does not imply pain.<n><n>### Response 2: Answer: B: backache. Since the car crash might not involve pain, the pain can be a result of driving the car.<n><n>### Justification: B: backache: We find the best match for the scenario given by B. The sentence is asking about what might happen after driving and does not specify what might happen if there is a car crash so option E. cannot be chosen as it is irrelevant to the scenario being specified by the sentence.<n><n>### Answer: 1. Which type of car is the fastest in the world?  Choices: A: Formula 1 B: motor C: Supercars D: Racing car E: Roadster<n>2. Choices: A: formula 1 B: motor car C: supercars D: racing cars E: roadster Answer: A: Formula

Yes, and? B. No, and? C. Yes, and? D. No, and? E. Yes, and?<n>Rationales: a. The answer to the second part of the question is 'No', which is the second option given in the answer choices.<n>This means that the sentence should be rephrased as, "In addition to the previous question, there is an important part of you that I need to consider: whether or not you can use your laptop as a monitor."<n>b. The sentence implies that the additional or different part of the question is connected to the whole context of the question, which means it should not be a new question.<n>c. Both 'Yes' and 'No' could also be used as the answer to the original question to which the first part of the question referred. But using 'Yes, and?' instead of 'Yes, or?' would make more sense, as 'Yes, and?' would imply that it is a new question.<n>d.

It might seem obvious to you that the speaker is referring to books, but in order to answer correctly we must be sure of the kind of object spoken about.<n>So we must consider all the options, and eliminate the ones that don't make sense, and we only have one option (E) left.<n><n>The sentence asks us to examine different things, but what we are examining, we learn from the third person pronoun 'it'.<n><n>The first three options refer to things, but they are incorrect because, as mentioned above, none of them have chapters on the front.<n><n>The last option (E) is the one that makes sense to answer the question and also to explain why we examine these things as well as the chapters.<n><n>Because there are many things to examine, if we examine the chapters in some books, then we can see what things are. This makes sense.<n><n>So the only option that makes sense is E: see particular program.<n><n>### Input:[Why is it that I have to be so quiet in the library?]Choices:  A: it's a place that's very quiet. <n>B: because everyone's trying to study. <n>C: you're being nosy.

'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What is a great, but non-specific, overall benefit of exercise? Choices:  A: good health B: heart attacks C: relaxation D: rest E: fatigue<n><n>### Response:		I believe it should be A: good health.<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The question refers to a benefit of exercise, which is a good health.<n>2. Answer D: rest can’t be the answer because rest is when not doing anything. <n>3. Answer E: fatigue can’t be the correct answer, because the sentence is asking us about physical benefits of exercises. <n>4. While it is possible that exercise can make our physical body fatigued, there must be some other benefits which answer D: rest clearly misses. <n>5. So, the only remaining options are Choice A: good health, B: heart attacks, C: relaxation, <n>6. And Choice C: relaxation.<n>7. Since Choice A: good Health refers to a wide range of benefits, including heart attacks and relaxation, it is a better choice to Choice A: good healtch because the choice is more specifically directed to a benefit of the exercise. <n>8. Therefore the answer is A: good health. <n><n>### Input Choices:  A. How big B. How much C. How often D. How far E. How many<n><n>### Response Choices:  A) How big B) How much C) In spite of D) In the end E) In a word<n><n>### Rationales: Choices A B C D E are all correct.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5.

A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where would you be going if using a parking lot near a roller coaster? Choices:  A: farm B: business district C: car D: amusement park E: urban area<n><n>### Response:		You'd go to a roller coaster. The only suitable answer choice is the third option E: Urban area because that is a general location; it can be used to describe the place near. The first three options can't be used because they are all types of buildings. The fourth and fifth ones are locations that are often near roller coaster. (C: Car and D: Amusement Park) but not always. (D) Amusement Park, the fifth option, is a location that has a roller coaster but it doesn't have to because it is an amusement park. (B) Business district, the fourth option, is a location where there are usually offices, but not a roller coaster because it is a district. The sixth one (A) Farm is not suitable because when it contains a roller coaster it is an amusement or theme park, not a farm. The seventh one (E) Urban area is suitable because it can be used to refer to a place near a roller coater. Answer: E: Urban Area <n>

Choices:  A: battle field B: museum C: weapon D: canon E: tornado<n><n>### Response:		The right choice is C: weapons.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n># 1. The question is directed at a location, not a noun; a battlefield is the answer to the question posed.<n><n># 2. Battlefields are usually where bullet projectiles are located because battles are fought on battlefields.<n><n># 3. Weapons are used to fight battles; they are not found on battlefields directly.<n><n># 4. Canon is not where the bullet projectiles are found, because cannons are weapons. So, the choice is not canon.<n><n># 5. In the sentence, museum refers to a place where items are stored and displayed.<n><n># 6. Although there can be museums in battlefields, they are not where projectiles are stored. Hence, the answer cannot be museum.<n><n># 7. The sentence refers to projectiles, which suggests guns which are referred to as canons.<n><n># 8. Therefore, the right answer is (d) weaapons because they can found in the armory which is where the weapons are kept.<n><n>### In summary, the correct answer is C: weapons.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where would you put a light?

Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What happens to the conscience of someone who has been caught committing a murder? Choices:  A: jail time B: fear C: going to prison D: nothing E: feeling of guilt<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The ________ of someone who has been ________ committing a murder is generally a sense of ________.<n><n>1. The sentence is quite lengthy and requires you to understand what the sentence wants us to say, you need to work with the sentences to identify what the writer is telling us.<n><n>2. The subject of the sentence is the action done to the "murderer", so in other words the person is caught.<n><n>3. This then tells us that the following clause is the consequence of that action.<n><n>4. Therefore, we want to find the word which could reasonably be understood as "consequence".<n><n>5. We can then use that word (e.g. feeling of guilt) as the part of speech required in the blank.<n><n>6. As option A: jail time involves imprisonment, we can eliminate this.<n><n>7. As option B: fear involves the word "afraid", we can also eliminate it as being the correct part of speech required.<n><n>8. So, the answer must be C: going to prison.<n><n>Answer: C: going to prison

Choices:  A: mouth B: grocery store C: constructing models D: shed E: box<n><n>### Response:		<n>> D: shed<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. 'Where' indicates that we need the location of the toothpicks.<n>2. The first choice (A: mouth) is obviously wrong because it doesn't reflect the location of tooth picks at all.<n>3. The next 2 options (B: grocery store and C: constructing models) are both wrong, because although they are all about making/ buying/ selling or storing things, they do not give us the location/ place where the things are kept and/ or where they can be found/ obtained e.g. constructing models are built in a constructing model workshop.<n>4. The last choice (E: box) does not give a location at all.<n>5. Therefore, the only possible answer that provides a location of farmers' toothpicks is D: shed.<n>Input: Why do we put candles in the windows? Choices:  S: to let others know you are open A: for lighting in the dark B: To get a job C: Because we are happy to see candles<n><n>Answer: S: to let others, others know you are open, are open<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. Candles are not used to indicate that the house is occupied or that there is a presence in the house. However, candles ARE used to indicate that certain events, businesses or establishments are available for use or to provide light. As we read from the options, it is more than obvious that B, C or D is an answer which must be chosen.<n>2. 'Why' signals that more than one reason must be given.<n>3. C and D do not answer the question adequately, as it only provides one reason.<n><n>4. A is not true. It is true for some old and antique houses, however in most houses, they are not used for lighting.<n>5. B is not true. It doesn't indicate we are happy to see them, but indicates we don't have lights available for our windows.<n>6. The only answer that satisfactorily answers the question is S: to let others (know you are open).<n><n>Answer: <n>```python<n>def solution(s,t):<n>    for x in range(len(s)):<n>        if x == len(s)+1:<n>

Choices:  A: library B: study area C: table D: classroom E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think you should put it on a shelf.<n><n>#### Rationals:<n>The verb 'put' requires that there is a place for something to be put, and the verb 'use' requires that the dictionary is used while it is there. Therefore, a dictionary must be put somewhere while it is being used.<n>1. The noun classroom is used to refer to a place that is associated with the process of study, teaching, and learning. While a student is using a dictionary, the dictionary will most likely be placed on their desk.<n>2. When you are using a tool at a desk, it is placed on the desk, not on any other surface. Therefore, option A: library will not do.<n>3. Option B: Study area will have to be removed as well because a dictionary will not be placed on a study area.<n>4. Option D: classroom cannot be used either because 'dictionary' is a countable noun and referring to it without a determiner is ungrammatical.<n><n>5. The last 2 options: study area and shelf are grammatically correct. We know from the verb 'put' that it is not ungrammatical to refer to a dictionary without a determiner like the: a, an, or the. So, the answer is E, shelf.<n><n>Answer: E: Shelf<n><n><n>### Input : Which of the following words bests describe the definition of a dingo?<n><n><n>### Deminstration: <n><n>The dingo is an animal of the family Canidae that is native to Australia.

Choices:  A: do enjoy B: get laid C: enjoyable D: work less E: enjoy living<n><n>### Response:		They would have fun and do "enjoyable" things tonight.<n>Rationales:1. The entire phrase was yelled out by the rowdy frat boys, which implies that they would have fun "and" do something enjoyable.<n>2. If the group was planning on "getting laid" things, the phrase would not necessarily include an "and" in place of their current words.<n>3. Next, the first "enjoy" option is incorrect because it describes an activity that is done for fun.<n>4. Similarly, the second option, "enjoyable," while not the best word choice, is the only one that captures the idea of having a good time.<n>5. While "work" and "less" seem to work, the phrase was meant to indicate pleasure and enjoyment, not labor.<n>6. Lastly, both fun and "enjoying" are meant for describing things that don't require too much work.<n>7. Therefore the only choice that matches these descriptions is Enjoyable.<n>\(CORRECT\)<n><n>### Input:"The children are having what types of activity today in class?" Choices:  A. Fun, enjoyable, boring B. Work C. Learning D. Boring, Fun, Enjoyable E. Work, Learning, Fun<n><n>### Response:"They are having both fun and learning today in class."<n>Rationales:  1. "Fun" in the question refers to being excited and happy, so the response would also be describing the children's state rather than their activity.<n>2. "Enjoyable" in the question refers someone or something that brings satisfaction or pleasure, so the response would describe the children having that experience.<n>3. "Boring" in the question refers being dull, so the response would not use that term.<n>4. "Boring, fun, enjoyable" in the question does not match the other parts.<n>5. "Work, learning, fun" in the question is a list of activities, but the response is describing a state.<n><n>### Example 3:<n><n>### Input:(I don't think) she can help with the party. Choice: A.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:The master control for the Tardis is where in the main room?

Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:There was a show on television about a ranger who loved flowers, but the next day it was about a gardener who also loved flowers.  It was a what? Choices:  A: countryside B: anthology C: dull read D: state park E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this situation, the sentence refers to the TV show. However, it does not specifically refer to the TV show itself, but the shows that the TV station broadcasts or airs on TV. Therefore, it is implied that this specific TV show (about ranger) did not air on TV the next day; instead, there was a different TV show (about gardener) which did air on TV.<n><n>1. Because "TV show," which is used in the sentence, refers to the shows aired on TV, we can rule out options B: anthology and options D: state parks, which refer to different TV shows altogether.<n>2. In order to answer the question we need to figure out what type of shows are normally aired on TV. <n>3. The only options that fit this description are option A: countrysides and option E: Surface of earth. <n>4. However, we can rule out option A: countrydise because the TV station airs only shows, and not the country itself. <n>5. We can also rule out option C: dumb read, because television isn't just about reading, as a whole, but also includes various other activities such as watching movies and listening to music concerts.<n>6. Hence, we can conclude that the answer is option B: anthology. It is an on-going TV show which includes a bunch of different tv shows airing in sequence, without necessarily having a main character, which is the case in the TV show.<n>Answer: B. Anthology.<n>

Choices:  A: sun B: sky C: candle D: house E: lamp<n><n>### Response:		Answer: C: candle<n>Detailed Rationales: 1) When analyzing the options, it’s helpful to look at the question and determine the parts that can be eliminated. In this sentence, we can easily eliminate the parts that indicate there is more than one light source. 2) We can also determine what the question isn’t asking. In this case, we know it isn’t asking for what type of light source it is, for it isn’t likely to be “electric” after all. Furthermore, we know it isn't asking what kind of decorative source they may be using because this makes no sense at all.<n>3) We can begin to answer the question that’s actually asked by analyzing the parts that can’t be ruled out. Given that we know there is only one light source being referred to, it must be a vintage or decorative light source. 4) We know this source doesn’t have a “sun”, it doesn’t need one, because the source would be decorative or vintage. We know it isn’t a “sky”, it’s not a light source, just the sky. 5) We know it’s not a “candle” because if this were a candle, they wouldn’t want to “light it”, they would probably just “burn it". Furthermore, the words “set in” or “dress up” are more commonly associated with a candle as it relates to a candlestick. 6) We know it’ s not a “house”, it has nothing to do with lighting the house, it’s an actual light, not a source to illuminate a house with. 7) The last option, “lamp”, would make sense, as they would actually want to “light” it, which would mean the source is not decorative in the sense that they would want to dress it up. 8) We also know it wouldn’t make sense to dress up a house, the source would have to be some sort of decorative or vintages lamp.<n>9) In summary, the only logical answer to this question is C, “candle,” which is also the most commonly accepted answer.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7.

Choices:  A: fearless B: english carrier C: courageous D: brave E: achromatic<n><n>### Response:		A: fearless<n>### Rationales: 1."Is associated with the opposite" is a clear indicator of being a noun that describes characteristics of the color yellow.<n>2. Looking at the options, we can eliminate A: fearless, because a "fearless" animal is one that doesn't fear anything, and the color yellow is used to describe bravery, which is the opposite of fear in most situations.<n>3. It would look like we need to eliminate C: courageous, for the same reason. However, we can't fully eliminate the option, because it is also possible to have an animal that is "fearless, yet brave." Therefore, it is possible that courageous is still a suitable answer.<n>4. Looking at the next options, we can immediately eliminate B: English carrier, because "English" is an adjective, and the answer is looking for a noun, which would be the opposite of "English carrier."<n>5. So, we look at D: Brave, E: Achromatic, and realize that Achromatic is the best candidate for the correct answer, as it is an antonym for colorful. Additionally, the answer is looking for some characteristic of a "color," which is an antonym of "achromatic." <n>6. Therefore, the answer choice is E: Achromatic. However, a bravery color is not actually "achromatic," we also need to explain why this choice works by modifying the answer to read, "achromatic bravery."

Choices:  A: tear up B: see light C: fill with tears D: be happy E: glass over<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: tear up<n><n>### Demostration:<n>1. The sentence asks us to infer what the first thing a newborn sees will be when their eyes open.<n>2. Looking at the four choices, A: tear up is an option not suitable for answering the question. <n>3. The sentence does not ask about the first tears that fall from the newborn's eyes when their eyes open. <n>4. Next, the sentence does not ask what the first thing(s) a newborn sees at birth will be. <n>5. Next, the sentence also doesn't speak about teary eyes getting glassy like they do when you cry. <n>6. Choice B: see light is not a suitable choice either. <n>7. The sentence does not say the newborn is happy at the time they open their eyes. <n>8. So, choice C: fill with tears is irrelevant in determining the first thing the newborn will see. <n>9. Choice D: be happy refers to a feeling or emotion and can't be something the newborn will see upon opening their eyes. <n>10. It could also be that the newborn is not happy when they open their eyes for the first time. <n>11. So, the only choice that correctly answers the question is A: tear up.<n>12. Thus, the answer is A: tear.<n>Answer: A: tear up<n>### Input:Asking for permission can mean that you’re A: begging B: seeking C: looking for D: expecting E: not expecting <n>### Response:Asking for permissions is not begging, seeking, looking for, expecting or not expecting. <n>Asking for permissions means that you ask someone for permission. Thus, the answer would be B: seeking.<n>### Input:Where can i buy these shampoo? Choices: A: chemist B: bathroom C: supermarket D: drugstore E: hair salon<n>### Response:The question asks that what places you could go to buy these shampoos. <n>Now, if you were to translate, you would think "super" means above, so we will translate as above. As we see, it was a small mistake, as we have learned in the article above is that super means supermarket. <n>##

Choices:  A: sophisticated B: imprevist C: arcane D: heavenly E: new<n><n>### Response:		The word'mundane' is very subjective, and often people use it interchangeably with words like'simple' or'regular'. However, it has an exact definition. Dictionary dot com provides the following definition:<n><n>mundane \ˈmən-ˌdān\ adjective (ˈmən-ˈdān, -ˈdon) formal : not very impressive, interesting, or strange<n><n>The word ‘impressionable’ refers to something impressive or something that creates a strong impression in someone’s mind, therefore it cannot substitute for the word boring. The same applies to the concept ‘arcane’, that means that something can be hard to understand or difficult to figure out, but it’s hardly interesting or intriguing. The word ‘heavenly’ is one that’s almost synonymous with amazing, but it still doesn’t really address the question of boring. One interesting aspect of the English language is that there are many words that are in the same context and which describe the same concept, but one has a slightly different word order and different emphasis on the main concept. Another example would be the word 'impresario' which describes an impressive person of authority, or someone in charge of impressive events or shows.<n>'New', the last of the options provided, does in fact have an excellent definition. When this word is used in the context of boring it describes something boring because it has just been introduced to you recently. An example will be used to better explain this scenario. Let's say that you are going through the dictionary in order to find an interesting or unusual word and you stumble upon the word 'banjaxed'. When you think that there are several words already in the dictionary that convey this meaning you realize that the word was introduced to you the previous week and it already became boring. As stated, 'new' does not have to mean recently acquired knowledge, it can mean recently introduced as well.<n>Rationales:1. The word mundane already has a definition that is unique, it is often intermingled with the word'regular' but that it is not one and the same thing. Mundane implies that something is boring, as the definition states, "a person who has never traveled, been to a different country, eaten at a fancy restaurant is a kind of mundane person". You could substitute the word for boring
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:David hurt all over. He was tired, he was shaking, and he was in pain.  He hadn't gotten what he needed in a long time.  He was suffering from what? Choices:  A: addiction B: fatigue C: relaxation D: headaches E: over eating<n><n>### Response:		<n>Covering all the details from 'David hurt all over.' to 'E: over eating.' correctly.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>It can be inferred from the context that David, after a long period of 'being in pain,' feels fatigued (Covered from 'He was tired'). If David has been hurting for a long time, the next thing he needs is relaxation (Answered 'He hadn't gotten enough in a long time'). In order for him to feel relaxed, he must feel confident that he can rest without hurting himself. However, he may have been hurting himself by doing so (Answered 'and he was in pain'). So, now he is suffering from headaches (Covered from the last part) and overeating (Covered from part before 'over eating'). The only correct answer is E: over eating (Covered all the details.)<n><n>### Input 1: Write the correct answer to the question given below.<n><n>Input: What is a group of monkeys called? Choices:  The troop. The band. The group. One The flock.<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answers are: The troop, The band, The group.<n><n>The last choice is incorrect as the noun following a gerund must be a noun, not a verb. (I/We play basketball for a living.)<n><n>### Instructions 2:<n>Input: The answer is A: the troop B: the band C: the group D: the flock E: none of the above<n><n>### Response 2:<n>Answer: C: The group<n><n>### Explalantion<n><n>The context of "What is a group of monkey's called?" suggests that there should be a plural response. Because "A: the troop" is referring to a group of monkeys that doesn't need a plural, "The troop" is chosen as the wrong answer for this exercise. <n>The most common way to form such noun plurals does not involve the use of "s". ("Group of monkeys" would be "a group of monkeys.") So, option C: "the group" is chosen most likely.<n><n>### Input<n>

Choices:  A: wrong B: death of C: bad D: negative E: evil<n><n>### Response:		He told the murderer he _was pure evil_<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>1. The options begin with two answers which are the same as the question word "pure". Firstly, the sentence asks for something that can be found before or after the guilty verdict, so option A: after which refers to something that happens later. Therefore, this option is not correct.<n>2. Next, the sentence refers to two things that can follow the guilty verdict. It states that one of these is the murderer, who is being judged after the guilty verdict. This eliminates the options C: bad and D: negative from the answer choices.<n>3. Finally, the murderer is mentioned as the only person in the question word "punishable", which eliminates option E: evil from the answer choices. Therefore, the question word 'pure' refers to a word that refers to murderer as he is "guilty". Therefore the sentence is a question asking'murderer is who that is pure what'.<n>4. However, since murder is a crime, the sentence is referring to the action of crime. That meaning is the answer C: bad. Therefore, the sentence is an answer of'murderer was bad'.<n>5. Hence, the answer of the sentence is C: bad.<n><n>Input: What's happening in this movie? Choices: 1. A: A love story 2. B: A crime film 3. C: A musical 4. D: A horror film 5.

This is because, the statement is all about the goods but the last noun is'refrigeration'. But, C: refrigerate refers to refrigerators or a place to keep food and goods cold. The next choice is the D: cargo ship. This doesn't answer the statement as it is about the long sea journey, but cargo ship comes before many containers of goods and then the choice (after) unloaded by a long sea journey.<n>The next choice is B: Port.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where are seats most likely bleachers?

Choices:  a. shoes b. Shoes c. sho 2. d. shoe 3. e. shoe's<n>### Response: C, shoes is the plural for shoes<n>### Response is not correct. The plural of shoe is still shoes or sho's.<n>### Input is the same as one we've already looked at.<n>### The correct answer is shoes, not sho.<n>### The next answer, sho, is incorrect because the second 'o' is in the wrong place.<n>### The last answer, sho's, is incorrect because it combines a plural form (shoes) and a possessive. Even though possessives can be formed with apostrophes, this is just wrong.<n>### The only correct answer is shoes.<n>### The plural form of shoe is still "shoes" even though it is not written the same way it is spoken.<n>### I recommend adding this answer in the future as a reference for the plural of'shoes' can be very difficult.<n>

Choices:  A: vegetables B: market C: doctor D: train station E: bookstore<n><n>### Response:		The answer is C: doctor<n><n><n>Rationales:<n>1. Reading is an action and has no direction.<n>2. "Your" refers to "YOU" so it is also second person singular<n>3. "Reading Magazines" and "Waiting for a Vehicle on Rails" are both activities of the sentence subject<n>4. "On Rails" is not the direction of a vehicle but is a location.<n>5. It is not the magazines that you are reading<n>6. You are reading the magazines if you are waiting on a vehicle on rails at the same time (same location).<n>7. "Your" is used for the location (in this case the location is the doctor) therefore making the answer correct.<n>8. Answer: Dr. John Doe 9. If You are reading the magiznes while waiting for a vehicle and you are in a doctor's office then the answer is C: Doctors Office<n>9. If you are reading the magaznes while waiting for a bus and you are on the bus then the answer is B: on the bus.  <n><n>### Input :  What is the result of addition of 2, 4, 6, and 8? Choices: 1 A: add 6 B: add 8 C: add 2 D: add 4 E: add 4<n><n>### Response : The answer is D: add 4.<n><n><n>Rationaleses:<n>1. Add 2, add 4, add 6, add 8<n>2. The steps involved are adding, add 2, adding 4, add 5, adding 2<n>3. What is the result is not asking what is the addition to 2, 4 and 6<n>4. When 2 is added to 4 then the result is 6<n>5. When 2 is then added to 6,then the result is 8<n>6. So you can see that by adding 2, 4,6, 8 you get 14 or 2, 4 8<n>7. So when you add it all it is 14<n>8. Answer: D: add 4<n>9.

This would make sense if option A was 'two', but it is not. Because if there were two types then there would be nothing else. Therefore, option A: A couple is incorrect because it is actually a very vague way of saying there was only two.<n>Option B: At least six means there is at least 6 types of dinosaurs. How many is option B? 7. There is 7 Types of dinosaurs in option B, but there are 8 in option D. Therefore, option D can't be A.

Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What happens when you take a shower after going for a run? Choices:  A: feeling refreshed B: becoming tired C: restlessness D: leg cramps E: sweating<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>### For Choice A: "Feeling refreshed" describes a negative sensation: tired, not refreshed. The statement of the question is contradicting: "after going for a run, you ___ in a shower" The word "refreshed" is negative.<n><n>### The question is asking what one will be feeling after a shower. (We assume they have gone for a run) In such a case, the feeling will be refreshed.<n><n>### Hence A, B,C and D can be ruled out easily.<n><n>The option E, describes the positive sensation which one obtains after showering after a long run. Hence the option E will be the right answer.<n><n>### Answer: E: sweating<n>

Choices:  A: graph B: bank at noon C: good book D: post office E: bus stop<n><n>### Response:		<n>C<n>### Rationale:<n>1. The sentence tells us that, where you stand in the line, it is cold, and so you need a coat.<n>2. The choices consist of different places that require some kind of coats.<n>3. Choice A: graph is not one of the places where the sentence takes us to.<n>4. Choice B: bank at noontime is one of the places we go to in the sentence - a bank. We could wear a jacket/coat at this place.<n>5. Likewise, Choice C: good book, though generally we associate coats with winter, is also one of the places we could go in the sentence.<n>6: Choice D: post office is one of the places as well - we can go here to post a letter too.<n>7. The last place in the sentence is a bus stop. So, we could not wear a coat there as it is generally a warm place, but at the other places mentioned in the sentence, we do use coats. Hence, D: post office cannot be the answer.<n>8. Therefore it follows choice E: bus stop.<n>Answer: E. bus stop<n>### Conclusion:<n>TASK: <n>FRAME : I am looking for a place to post my letter.<n>STRAWMAN : Burn hot<n><n>### Input - I have lost my way.

Choices:  What: A: for B: in C: to D: at E: from<n>Rationales: 'What are you looking at the' refers to the picture, and 'the picture' is a thing. We can choose a noun to describe this thing appropriately. <n>1. 'For' is misplaced as 'at' or 'on' is required. Hence 'for' can be eliminated.<n>2. The preposition 'in' suggests a container in which there are things. So we can pick a suitable noun to refer to the thing in this container.<n>3. In the second choice, 'to' is correct.<n>4. However, in the third option, 'at' is incorrect.<n>5. Hence, the correct answer is B: in.<n><n>### Input:'what are they doing at the party?

Choices: 	<n>A: cold water B: dirty water C: ice D: salt E: snow<n>Rationales:1. When the sentence begins with 'There are...', you know there is going to be a list.2. 'Many different kinds of snow' is too general - it doesn't necessarily require different types of snow. For example, the temperature or the consistency of the snow could be the same as always but it is still referred to as a 'kind' of snow. So,'many different kinds of snow', isn't the answer.<n>3. Next, we have 'Cold water'. This is an incorrect answer because cold water is not made up of the individual snow particles. Rather, cold water refers to water which is at a much lower temperature than is usual for regular water - which of course, it's not 'cold'. <n>4. The next choice option, 'Dirty water', is also incorrect. Although dirty water contains snow particles, it doesn't contain the type of snow that the question refers to.<n>5. Option E:'snow' is correct but it isn't part of a list, so it can't be the answer.<n>6. So, the only option that can fit the structure is B: ice.<n>Hence, the answer is B. ice.<n><n>Answer: B. ice<n><n>### Instructions:Answer following multiple choice questions using one

Choices:  a: top b: bottom c: top and bottom d: first and last e: last and first f: most important g: most significant h: the last<n>Rationales :1. The question asks about the items on the list at the end, so the term 'last' is needed in our answer.<n>2. The term 'last' usually tells us that something is at the end.<n><n>- Looking at our options, we find that option A: top is not a 'last' item on the list, so it does not answer the question.<n>- Option B: bottom is often used for a 'last' item as well. But, since list is never considered top or bottom, B: bottom is also not suitable as an answer.<n>- Option C: top and bottom, however, is used to define the two ends of the list. Thus, our options now reduce to D: first and last (the two extremes) and E: last and first (the initial and ending points).<n>- Next, we look at F: first and last (two extremes). Since this answer does not contain the term 'last', it doesn't meet the requirement.<n>- Option G: most important and H : most significant also exclude the term 'last', and can't answer the question either, so these are disqualified as well.<n>- So we are left with options E and D.<n>- Let’s consider E: last and first in further detail. This phrase refers to the initial and concluding points on a list.<n>- Since a list is never considered the last or the first, E: last and first doesn’t answer the question. Option E is disqualified.<n>- This leaves D: first and last as the correct answer. There are really two items: first and last. First refers to the initial item on a list and last means the penultimate (next to last) item on a list. The last item is the last item on the list.<n><n>Answer: D: first and last<n><n>### Instruct:Write a response that appropriately answers the following question.<n>Input: I would like to see my doctor next.

Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1.

Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where in your home would you store birth control pills near your toothpaste? Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: chemist's shop C: kitchen D: drug store E: bedroom<n><n>### Response:		D: Drugstore<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Here the word "your" refers to the student, so the student refers to his/her home in this context.<n><n>2. Although there might be a medicine cabinet in a home, you don't generally store birth control pills, as well as toothpaste, and even in the same cabinet.<n>Because there doesn’t need to be a drug store in a home, we remove the option B: chemist’s shop.<n>3. Toothpaste belongs in the bathroom, so we must discard the option C: kitchen.<n>4. We remove the option D: drugstore because a drugstore provides the same medications that are in the medicine cabinet and does not store birth control pills.<n><n>5. Therefore, we are left with option E: bedroom.<n>6. Bedroom is the only choice which reflects the usage of storing medication in a different room as it is not used for oral care.<n><n>### Input :Why do they close this restaurant's kitchen early on Sunday? Choices:  Tiffany:  A: It's not convenient. B: They lose a lot of time. C: There aren't enough customers. D: Employees can't stop cooking even when it's time to close. E: All of the above.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. We cross out Choice Tiffany and her choices with Choice Tiffany.<n>2. Here, "it's not convenient" means "it's not in the right location" or convenient for them to work, which means they should go somewhere else.<n>3. The next two choices, "they lose a lot of time" and "there aren't enough customers" do not support the idea of a different location.<n>4. Instead, they show that they should work on Sunday, as there can be a lot of work for them to do, so we cross out those choices.<n>5. If an employee stopped cooking early on any day of the week, then that means that they were working in a restaurant that was open early enough to start cooking. In this case, however, the restaurant is still open and can cook all evening long, so even if employees stopped cooking early on Sunday, they would still have enough time to prepare for a dinner rush, if

Choices:  A: city B: downtown C: own house D: bar E: shopping center<n><n>### Response:		D: bar<n><n>### Rational: 1. The question asks where you would be able to find places to buy/eat things of different types. This could be done in a town (option A: city). <n><n>### Demand: 2. But the question also asks for'many different types' of things, therefore there needs to be'many' of each and so it is not possible in the town.<n><n>### 3. The word 'downtown' is also used for city-centers.

The word 'if' in the sentence tells us that 'when on a bus' it is likely that a person will go to the toilets.<n>2. As the question is also about the toilet, most buses will have to stop at a bus station.<n>3. Buses commonly stop in town/city so it would make sense that (option A: town) would be the answer.<n><n>### You get this answer by excluding (option B: city,) and (option C: country,) because (option B: city) is an unnecessary word, it is not common to use 'the' 'country' <n><n>### 4. and (option C: toilet) just explains the toilet - no use when there is already just the 2 options to choose from.<n><n>### Final Answer: A: town<n><n>### Rewording the question<n><n>**Example:**<n>'Where will you probably go to if on a bus?'<n><n>### Answer<n><n>Option A: town<n><n>Option B: city<n><n>Option C: toilet<n><n>Option D: country<n><n>### Input <n>"What would you be most likely to expect to find in a box?"<n><n>### Demostration<n>You would be most likely to expect a candy or cookie.<n><n>### Option A: fruit and vegetables<n><n>### Option B: candy and

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:He called bull when his friend said a bull can be what? Choices:  A: feeble B: bullbleep C: cow D: female E: charging prey<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The sentence asks us to provide a noun for'something that the friend said'.<n>2. A 'feeble' bull is not the one his friend is referring to.<n>3. A 'bullbleep' is also unrelated to the friend's statement, as a 'bullbleep is an exclamation, which is totally different from a statement.<n>4. A 'cow' is likely to be something that his friend refers to as 'feeble', not that's 'bull', as the friend referred to the former as a 'feeble' one.<n>5. 'Female' refers to a 'bull', instead, to it's opponent, the 'cattle'.<n>6. 'Charging prey' could also fit, as to a bull is a prey.<n>7. However, 'charging prey' is not necessarily a feeble animal because it depends on the situation.<n>8. We can narrow our options by eliminating the 'cow' and 'prey' as unsuitable.<n>9. Looking at 'bullbleep', its meaning has already been defined in the sentence.<n>10. So, the sentence can be better summarized using the word 'bull' and 'feeble bull'.<n>11. Hence, the only suitable answer in the question is 'feeble b'ull' as the statement is about a feeble bull.<n>12. We can finally eliminate'male b'ull' and 'charging prey'.<n>13. The answer to the question is 'feeeble b'ull'.<n><n>Answer: Feeble b'ull

Where did he drive? Choices:  A: great granddad's house B: family picture book C: brother's house D: family tree E: family reunion<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is D:  family tree. He drove his niece to his brother's house. <n><n>### Input 1: The family all had a great time at the holiday park. Choices:  A. At the beach B. At the caravan C. In the car, D. In the motel E. In the pool<n>  Rationales: 1) We can immediately rule out A. At the beach. This is an incorrect answer because the family didn’t actually holiday at the beach, but at the holiday park they spent their time in the caravan, in the car, or in the pool.<n>2) We also rule out B. At the car-van. A holiday park is not the same thing as a caravan.<n>3) We reject C. In the caravan. The whole family did not have a great time in the caravan.<n>4) At this point the sentence contains the word 'holiday' twice. This shows us that a holiday park is a vacation destination with amenities that provide a fun experience for families.<n>5) Therefore, the correct answer is E. In the pool. It is only in the pool that the family had a great time.<n><n>### Response 1: The correct answer is E.  The family had a great time in the pool.<n><n>### Input : "Diane and Robert visited a famous museum." Choices:  A, C, B, and D <n>Rationales: The question asks "Who" "Which" or "What" is used more often? In this sentence, the answer is "which" because it modifies the following adjective "famous" by turning it into an attributive adjective. <n>The words "which" and "that" are both used to refer to a specific noun such as "museum" or "carnival". The difference is that "which" is used with restrictive phrases while "that" is used with nonrestrictive phrases. <n><n>##

"Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What is something that you feel when you go to the opera?

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1.

Choices:  A: office building B: schoolroom C: library D: bedroom E: gym<n><n>### Response:		I would find the desk in a schoolroom because the desks are situated in rooms where the students are taught. It's not commonly found in gyms, bedrooms, offices, and libraries.<n><n>### Input::What is the most common use of an electric fan? Choices:  I. Air conditioning II. Cooling III. Heating IV. Heating and cooling<n>Rationales: I. Air conditioning is used to cool down a room (an air-conditioned environment is a comfortable temperature), so it’s not an option.<n>2. Cooling- A fan is used to cool down an interior space. Heating is used to warm up an area. However, a fan can also be used in cold weather or an air conditioned room, to blow air onto your face or other parts of your body and cool yourself down. So, this doesn't necessarily help determine the most common use.<n>3. Heating- A fan cools down an area in winter, but it cannot be used to heat.<n>4. Heating and cool- Heaters are better at heating, but a fan can be used to cool down a space, as well as in a cool environment.<n>Answer: III. Heating IV: Heating and cooling.<n>

Choices:  A: free time B: pleasure C: get divorced D: legal fees E: being lonely<n><n>### Response:		The lawyers and their legal fees.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The sentence asks about the cost of the divorce, which had a cost.<n>2. The first choice, "free time” would be unsuitable because the question asks about what the lawyers and the couples cost is referring to. <n>2. Next choice, "pleasure” would also be an unsuitable choice because it isn't a cost of divorce.<n>3. The next choice, “Get divorced” would also be an incorrect choice because it lacks the correct cost to go with the divorce.<n>4. The last choice, "legal fees” is a correct option that costs. <n>5. Therefore, the only correct answer to the question would be "“the lawyers and the legal fees”.<n>6. Hence, the answer would be B: Legal Fees.<n>Answer: B, Legal fees

Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: community C: building D: prague E: every city<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>C:<n>```<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1. "Where" in option A: residential neighborhood tells us that the answer should be a place.<n>2. Since a school is a physical building where children learn, the correct answers would be a building.<n>3. Option B: community doesn’t have to be correct.<n>4. Though option C: building seems to be correct the first time, we've to choose the correct option after the correction.<n>5. Thus, if there is an option such as a house in a building, it denotes that a particular house is built in an area, but it's not a general answer<n>6. So, we can choose this as the correct answer.<n>7. After correction, we can clearly see that a school is a building.<n>8. So, we can clearly choose the correct answer as C: building.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>1. In option A: D, we know that only prague could provide the information regarding the city.<n>2. We need to determine the reason why prague is necessary in the paragraph.<n>3. Since prague is one city that provides an example of what the author is talking about, the correct answer includes prague.<n>4. Therefore we choose E: every city(the paragraph talks about pragues as specific examples of what we're talking abut but not abput pragues alone.)<n><n>### Conclusion: It is recommended that you read the above description thoroughly.<n><n>### Note:<n><n>1.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Bob is in a dressing room.  He's putting on waterproof trunks and goggles.  What sort of facility is he most likely visiting? Choices:  A: swimming pool B: actors and actresses C: fancy restaurant. D: gym E: theatre<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The dressing room is clearly a facility where something is accomplished or prepared, so the correct answer would be B - Actors and Actresses.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>The instruction asks for the facility type where Bob is most likely visiting, but the answer is not directly provided nor even implied. <n>So, in order to determine the type of facility to use, I have to look at the type of activity he is performing:  putting on waterproof trunk and goggles  because this indicates that he is probably going to go swimming.<n>However, he does not have any place with him where it is possible/logical to swim. This is why he would have to go to a facility where such an activity could be accomplished.<n>Looking at options A, B, and C: the first option, swimming pool, can be ruled out because not only this activity is not applicable to dressing room (he can't swim), but also there is no reason to visit a swimming<n>pool when the weather is sunny.<n>The second option, actors and actresses, can be ruled out as well, because it<n>neither clearly expresses an activity that can be performed.<n>However, option D: gym can be ruled out as it is another place where people perform<n>various activities. The next and only viable option would be option E: theatre, <n>because it is a place that has all the above-mentioned things, and that is also<n>probably the place of where he is most likely visiting because swimming, swim<n>trunks, swim goggles, all can be found in a swimming pool.<n><n>## Other Ways to Express Yourself:<n><n>### Examples of Writing Task 1 questions in which you can choose one of a number of topics<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Write an introductory paragraph using all sentences and transition words correctly.<n>Explain the relationship between three of the most popular drinks sold in your country. <n><n>### Expert's Answer:<n><n>All the three drinks, namely, Coffee, Tea and Sugary Beverage, are consumed by majority of people. <n>The drinks come in a variety of types and flavors.<n>Also, coffee, Tea and Sugar Beverage are often found in most homes.

Choices:  A: supermarket B: kitchen cupboard C: table D: flea market E: dishwasher<n><n>### Response:		<n>What he had bought in the weekend were the collector items, but he sold all of them that day, from the plate to the rare collector item he had bought for the weekend.<n><n>### Input :He wanted to sell it to the butcher in a what? Choices: A: sale B: barter C: trade D: flea E: car-boot<n><n>### Demostration:<n>This question requires an understanding of the meanings of all the options.<n><n>What does this "it" refer to? According to the information supplied, it is the butcher that would like to buy one of the horses.<n><n>What does "it" refer to in the question? What are the possible answers to question? All the choices, A through E, could make sense but not necessarily together.<n>However, only answers A and B make sense because "it" cannot refer to the barter, the trade, the car-boot or even the sale. It would refer to neither "flea", "dishwasher" nor "the table".<n><n>### Analysis: Since it can only refer to the one option, A: sale and B: barter, it must be either A: sale or B: barter. <n><n>### The sentence is trying to clarify if the sale is a sale of the horse itself or of all the collector items.<n><n>### The horse is what it is, and will not appreciate a mention of the collector items and will likely bolt away as soon as anybody mentions "sale".<n><n>### It therefore seems logical to assume that the sale is of the collector items, and the butcher who is interested in one of the horses will like to buy the collector items instead.<n><n>### So, the sentence is trying to find out from the man selling the horse and collector items with how many horses does the man intend to sell. <n><n>## Demo<n>Therefore, the sentence implies that if the man were to sell collector items, he will do so in what and not in the other three options.<n><n>### Analysis :If the horse is being sold at the sale stall, then it can only refer to A: sale stall.<n><n>### A: sale stall is the only possible answer because no other choice can be correct because it refers to a "sale".<n> <n> <n>

Choices:  D: because he likes sports  E: because he needs a luxury vehicle F: because he needs transportation H: because he loves sports G: because he didn’t have a car<n>Rationales : 1. Too much information. The sentence contains a lot of unnecessary details. <n>2. We are only told that John chose the new car, but we don't know why. So, the choices don't need to relate to this information. <n>3. We can immediately eliminate H: because he lovensports because it’s not clear why John chose it and it doesn’t have any direct connection to why or why not. <n>4. We can also eliminate C: because he needs a LUSHIO. The last word, LUSHIO is not correct, it's missing an H. <n>5. Finally, we can eliminate F: because he needs a transportation because although it's true that a car can be used as transportation, transportation is not the why it's chosen. <n>6. Next, looking at E: because he needs transportion. Although there might be a logical connection between choosing a car and needing transportation, the information provided is not clear enough to support this hypothesis. We don't know if John needs a car because he needs transportation. It's also possible that he needs transportation because he doesn't have a car. <n>7. Eliminating G: because he didn't have a car seems reasonable, but it's a very tenuous connection. If John didn't have a previous car, why did he need this new one. It doesn't seem to make logical sense. 8.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:A person is alone in the woods and wounded, what should he do? Choices:  A: amount to nothing B: visit relatives C: charming D: doctor himself E: cross street<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>We should cross the street<n><n>### Justification: <n>The sentence demands the use of a suitable verb, which must be able to reflect the action of helping himself. Since the person is wounded, it's natural to think that in order to help himself he should seek medical care. Hence, the answer has to be either D: doctor himself or E: cross street. However, medical treatment can't be received by the person while he's injured. Rather, it's reasonable to help the person crossing the street to seek proper medical treatment. Hence, I choose E: cross street because although a doctor might help the person, the action of this verb better reflects the action of helping oneself. <n>Another thing that needs to be kept in mind when answering such questions is that it must be the person's action to help himself. That's why in this case I rule out both B: visit relatives and C: chasing himself. Since relatives won't be able to help the person crossing a street, it doesn't make sense for them to visit each other, but rather it just implies the action of one party. Since D: doctor himself is about helping oneself, it can't be used, which leaves us with E: cross street as the only other option.<n><n>### Other Instructions: <n>Write a response that appropriately parses the request.<n>Writing multiple choice questions<n>Writing multiple response questions<n><n>### Additional Instructions:

There's nothing in the answer choices that is not a location.<n>3. We need a place where wine is stored, so none of the others are a suitable answer.<n>4. Looking at option "B": basement, we know wine is stored in basements. But basements also house many things that don't have to do with wine. So, basement doesn't answer our question.<n>5. The church is a big building used to worship and for social events, but it isn't where wine is stored. So, the church isn't a suitable choice.<n>6. We can eliminate "D: church" too because it's not a suitable answer.<n>7. Option "C: art show" is a location but it isn't used for storing wine. So, "C: art show isn't the answer to the question.<n>8. We come to the last option E: Bar. It's a place where one goes to have a drink. So, the bar fits the question correctly.

We must choose one of these. So, 'by what' doesn't answer the above question, it might answer another type of question, but no type of question which the instruction asks.<n>2. The word used in the question is 'how' and not 'how'. The instruction uses the word 'How do', and the question uses the verb 'asks'.<n>3. So, the answer has to be a method. <n>3.

The choices in the options express a transportation options like 'bus', 'car', 'train', and 'plane'. But, 'What' is not in the group.<n>5.

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

Choices:  A: pocket B: shower C: chemist D: drug store E: shaving kit<n><n>### Response:		The person would store the double edged razor in a shower<n><n>### Rationales<n>The question is asking the most likely place of storage for a double edged razor.<n>1. The answer must be either A, B, or D. Choices A, B, and C are not where double edged razors are likely to be stored. Choose B, C, or D<n>2. The question mentions a “double edged razor”, this refers to razors equipped with two blades, one of the blades being at the top. The question asks about the most likely place for this type of razor to be stored, and not any other type of razor.<n>3. Razors with one blade are stored in pockets because of their size, so this answer is not a possible answer.<n>4. This type of razor is more likely to be stored in a shower, so this is the answer.<n>5. Choices E and any other answers do not fit.<n>6. Choice B: shower, D: drug store<n><n>### Response<n><n>### Rationale<n>The question asks “Where have you slept on a train?”<n><n>The question specifically states that the noun 'train' is the context. The word 'where' signals that we need a location, therefore we can rule out options A,C, and D, because they are not locations. Choices B and E are locations. B: bed is a place where you sleep. Thus, the answer choice is B: bed.

The sentence refers specifically to the noun ‘bed’, which can denote a general bed, or the specific side of a specific bed or place to rest<n>2. 'Left' and 'Right' are adverbs modifying 'the side of the bed' and cannot be correct answers because the sentence does not mention any bed, left, right, center, midway, or middle<n>3. The only two options which can be inferred from the context are 'center', the area of a bed in the middle, or'middle'.

One possible meaning of "what" is "in which place".<n>3. Therefore, the question is asking about the place in which the anemone are.<n>4. "in lake or river, or the like" or "in waterways and ponds" are possible meanings for "what".<n>5. So, this sentence asks where the anemone is in.<n>6. So, we now need to identify what lake the author is talking about.<n>7. "The author is using the word 'anemone' here, so it is not talking about a state in the US, but instead about a different kind of state.<n>8.

Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What would happen to you if you are not good at playing violin? Choices:  A: happiness B: relaxation C: create music D: sadness E: loud noises<n><n>### Response:		C: create music<n><n>Rationales: What would happen to you if not good playing violin:<n><n>1. Happiness and relaxation are positive feelings. If you are not good at a musical instrument you might feel happy or relaxed.<n>2. Loud noise, sadness and unhappiness are negative feelings. If you are bad at an instrument, you won’t hear loud noises.<n>3.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5.

Choices:  A: accomplish B: make progress C: stop arguing D: do business E: concert<n><n>### Response:		D: do business<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. As the question is asking about “a feat” to do, it means that we need to choose an option that reflects our ability to do something.<n>2. The choice B: make progress cannot be chosen, as it does not express our capability to do the action, only it indicates that something has already been done and that more progress has achieved.<n>3. Choice C: stop arguing implies that we have achieved stopping the argument, so it does not work here.<n>4. The option A: accomplish is too broad and not specific enough to do something.<n>5. Choice E: concert also tells us that we have already finished something, which doesn’t match the question.<n>6., The only option that is suitable to our needs for this sentence is the choice D: do business, as this matches our desire to successfully reach an agreement in the end.<n><n>### Input:"You did a great job on that project!" said Bill.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8.

Choices:  A: fire B: solar energy C: sun D: house E: coal or wood<n><n>### Response:		<n>Option A: fire: The question describes a situation where Dan outfitted his house with ways to use the oldest heat source on earth. The oldest heat source on earth would therefore have to be fire or wood. So it couldn’t have been solar energy because it wasn’t the oldest source on earth.<n><n>Option B: solar energy: Here the question describes Dan’s house, a place where it is normally warm due to fire; and a heat source, which doesn’t have to be the oldest one because it has been outfitted to use the oldest heat. So, it might not necessarily be the earliest, but Dan did, out of preference, use fire or wood.<n>Option C: sun: The old heat source describes Dan’s house which has been outfitted with a heat source, which should come from sun because in order to warm up the house, you have to utilize the sun in some way.<n><n>Option D: house: So, the question talks about the warmest place within earth, which is the house. So the house isn’t actually the answer to the question because in the question it states that Dan outfitted his. Then, in order to warm the house, he utilizes fire or wood. Which means sun isn’t the answer to the question.<n>Option E: coal or wood: As fire and wood are also the options, then you cannot rule out coal or wood. The whole reason of outfitting his house was because it’s warm so fire or wood would be more warm. However, it has to be the oldest heat source which is fire or wood.<n><n>Rationales:<n>1) Option A is incorrect because we have to utilize the heat which is fire or wood and not sun (solar energy) because it isn’t the oldest source which is fire or sun.<n>2) Option B is incorrect because it is the heat source which is fire, which isn’t the second oldest source which is wood or coal.<n>3) Option C is correct because Dan outfitted his, so the second oldest heat source, which is wood or fire has to be included.<n>4) Option D is incorrect because his house is a part of earth which is the question and fire or wood is the heat source.<n>5) Option E is incorrect because the oldest heat source which was already stated is fire or wood. You can’t include coal because according to the question it is out

So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:What would cause someone to use invitro for reproducing? Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n><n>### Response:		<n>In most cases when people reproduce, they do it with an expectation of producing an offspring. But in some cases, people reproduce through invitro such as when someone experiences infertility. The child produced through invitro is often referred to as "IVF baby" which is different from an offspring. <n><n>### Input Choice:<n>The answer to this question is an invitro which is the cause for having an offspring.  The invitro is when you create babies in a laboratory. It results in a child because it is the cause for having a baby. <n><n>However, the choice that answers the most is “infertility” because it causes people to use an invitro.<n><n>### Input choice:<n>A child produced through the IVF process is not an offspring as stated in the choices but rather it is an invitro that is being used for reproducing. <n><n>**Why is the child not an offspring, it is an invitrio because it is the cause of a reproduced offspring**.<n><n>### Expand the response<n>The answer is given by the choice D:larger family as the result of reproduction. <n>Explain why you need an IVF:<n><n>The children produced through the use of the invitro technology is not an offspring but an invitro. In the questions it states that invitros are created in a laboratory for reproduced offspring which means it is the cause of producing an offspring for the family who has this procedure.  If a family wants more family members to help them in the future or because they cannot have children that is why they use an invitro such as the choice D:largrer family.  So the question is not whether the children produced through the use IVF are offspring or invitros. It is whether an invitro is the cause or the result of reproduction that the question is referring to.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n><n>### Response:		The place in the picture is most likely a bus<n>### Rationales:<n>#### A. The word “water fountain” stands for a fountain of water and is not related to people standing in line; however, water fountain can also mean the place where people stand in line, such as a drinking fountain. Because “the water fountain” refers to a particular place, it is the main clause of the sentence that includes the answer.<n><n>#### B. The word “military” refers to armed forces. People in military lines stand in the military base but not near the road. People that stand in line near the road are likely to be the passenger in the picture, the student group at a bus stop.<n><n>#### C. The word “apartment” is a particular place where people live, and does not refer to a waiting place that people stand in for a long time;  “fire” and “house” make the answer “fire station” which is the wrong answer.<n><n>#### D. The word “firehouse” means a station where a fire department is located and does not refer to people waiting in line near a road. In addition, firefighters wait inside the fire station for a call of fire and do not stand outside.<n><n>#### E.The word “bus stop” means the station where people gather for the purpose of taking buses, and fits well into the sentence.<n><n>### Answer: E: bus stop<n>Input: Can dogs be inside classrooms?

The second option, “No,” is too vague and does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support its claim.<n><n>####<n>C. The third option, “No,” also lacks specificity in answering the question and fails to support its claim. There are specific types of classrooms, such as kindergarden, university student rooms, but also school classrooms, so there is a chance that dogs can be inside a classroom.<n><n>####<n>D. The last option, “Yes,” provides a more specific answer and supports its claim with specific examples:<n>In the past, dogs were only seen in the wild or in farming areas

Since she’s not good at dancing, the instructor teaches and helps her improve in the skill which is how bad the dancer is.<n><n>### #2<n>Instructions:<n>Write down your question in your own way and then find out an answer.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:If a student was about to graduate, they would no longer be attending what?

The option that describes that will be an answer which describes a setting or environment that is no longer attended.<n><n>The correct answer is E: school; since it is only when you graduate that you exit school, it doesn't make sense to choose other options.

Choices:  A: guilty conscience B: fear C: go free D: problems E: find god<n><n>### Response:		A: guilty conscience<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: Why did the chicken cross the road?<n>Choices:  A: To get to the other side B: A pun C: Cage D: For the eggs E: Chicken wanted to be on the other side.<n>Rationales:<n>1. "Why did" indicates that you want the answer to reflect the chicken's intention.<n>2. "The chicken crossed the road" in the sentence indicates that we already know the chicken crossed the road. We want to find out why the chicken crossed the street.<n>3. So we need an answer that explains the chicken's intentions before crossing the street.<n>4. None of the choices mention the chicken's desire to get to the other side.<n>5. The first, "Chicken crossed the road because it was on the other side". This is probably not the answer as the chicken cannot already know where he was. Rather, this could be said of the chicken when it reached the other side.<n>6. The second, 'To get cross the road". This does not indicate the chicken's purpose in crossing the road, rather it indicates the result of the crossing.<n>7. So the third choice, 'to get to the other side” gives a suitable answer and the fourth choice 'cage" cannot be the answer, as this choice doesn't involve crossing the road and only serves to separate the chickens.<n>8. In the fifth choice "chicken wanted to be on other side" the chicken doesn't even cross the street. It only wants to be on the other.<n>9. So the answer can't be that.<n>10. In summary, only two of the choices, "to get over" and "to get to" give an appropriate answer to the question.<n>11. But "to get to" is the more complete and specific answer, as it clearly indicates the intention of the chicken to reach the other side.<n>12. Therefore, the answer must be B: To get to the opposite side.<n>Answer: B : To get to the opposite<n>

It can better be described as what? Choices:  A: field B: alone C: small group D: solitude E: solitary<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The question is asking how to better describe the size of the crowd that was at the parade. The options that we will use to determine whether or not an answer makes sense will be small and big. We will know that we have the right answer if it is both small and big. Solitary, small, large aren't the only answers we can choose, however.<n><n><n>* The first possible answer is "it can better be described as field." This doesn't really make sense because if the crowd was big it would be hard to describe it as "field." "Solitary" is the answer we can chose to add to our other answer.<n><n>* One the other hand, "a small group" probably isn't how we would describe the crowd either. We have to look at our other responses. "Small" is also a thing, therefore it is logical that we will have to check our last possible answer. This is "solitary". "Small" makes sense with solitary, so we will have our answer.<n><n>* Option C: small group. This option doesn't really make any sense. It might be easy to describe the crowd with this line as a small group but the sentence wouldn't make any sense if they were small. "Small" can't really coexist with what the question wants.<n><n>* Option D: solitude. This option might make sense if the crowd was big, but it wouldn't make sense if they were small either. This option doesn'<n><n>* Option E: solitary. Solitary doesn't mean the same meaning as solitary. They say "alone" or "alone with". "Solitary" means "solitarily" not "solitarily." Therefore it is false.<n><n>* This brings us to our final answer: it can better be described as "small and big." Since you had to look at the sentence multiple times because you might not have caught this the first time, I did put it in bold for you in the answer. <n><n>The reason there were two types of adjectives in the previous instructions is that the question asked for ways to better describe the crowd. Because the crowd was both big and small, the only answer choice that really applies to the crowd is "both small and big".<n><n><n>### Input : The police officer was quite rude to me.

A multiple ruler would certainly be found in a drawer, so there is the answer of A: multiple ruler.<n><n>### Input : Where could you find multiple rulers that owned by different people?<n><n>### Response : A: multiple ruler<n><n>### Instructions:Which of these two statements from the text is not true?<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: In the past, all rugs would had to have had a pattern on them to be considered a rug. In the past this was an advantage to rugs makers and a restriction to those who wanted to buy a rug, because if you bought a rug with a pattern on it, you would have to look for that same rug again whenever the pattern is worn out which could take many years to wear out. Today, most rugs are plain, which saves money, and is a benefit to those who don’t like patterns but have to have rugs. Choices:  A : Today, most rugs have patterns on them. B : Today, all rugs have a pattern on them. C : Today, most rugg makers only have patterns on the rugs they make. D : Before today, rugs were not plain because it cost too much money to make plain rugs. E : Today, rugs could have as many decorations as you wish so long as both the design and the colour suit your room.<n>Rationales: (1)The information in this sentence states that in the past, all rug should have a pattern in them, not that today all rug should have a pattern. This is not true. (2)This sentence doesn’t mention what happens today, so we can’t assume that it happened yesterday as well which is what the sentence states. Therefore, A is the answer.<n>Answer: A: Today, most rugs do not have a pattern on them<n><n>### Input;<n>(If you go shopping for the right outfit. You can only buy a dress or a blouse, not both. You don't need to buy both, the point is that if you go shopping for an outfit, you can either buy a dress or a shirt, not both.)<n>(If you go to visit a friend, you can only eat chinese food or spaghetti, not both

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Rationales: 1. The sentence asks for a suitable noun to describe the complexity of the machine. <n>2. The first option, 'box', is not suitable because although a box could possibly contain complex things, it is not complex in itself.<n>3. The second option, 'apparatus', refers to a complex piece of equipment or machinery, making it a suitable choice.<n>4. The term 'appliance', the third option, is generally used to refer to devices that perform specific tasks, usually in a household setting, but it doesn’t necessarily imply complexity.<n>5. 'Wash dishes', the fourth choice, is a verb phrase and doesn't fit the structure of the sentence.<n>6. The last option, 'implement', is used to refer to tools or instruments that are meant for a particular purpose, but it doesn’t necessarily denote complexity.<n>7. Therefore, the only choice that fits the sentence correctly and reflects the complexity of the machine is 'apparatus'. <n>8. Hence, the answer is B: apparatus.<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Rationales: 1. "Where" initially tells us that the answer requires a location.<n>2. The question is basically asking where petrol is usually acquired.<n>3. So, it is a place where petrol is typically available.<n>4. We can immediately rule out option A: burn hot and option C: burn hot, as they are not locations.<n>5. Next we check option B: fuel tank. Though a fuel tank does contain petrol, it’s not a place where you can get petrol. So, this option doesn't answer the question.<n>6. Looking at option D: car. We put petrol in the car, but we do not get petrol from a car. So, this option can’t answer the question either.<n>7. Finally, we look at option E: gas station. A gas station is indeed a location where we go to get petrol.<n>8. Therefore, the answer is E: gas station.<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>### Input:Where could you put some olives to prevent them from getting nearby food wet?

Catching frogs<n><n>Input:The boy was a smart one, He could often be seen- Choices:  A Doing odd jobs B Doing his chores  C Doing his home work D Help him with his studies<n><n>#### Rationales: Doing odd jobs refers to completing the most difficult task first. Doing his homework refers to helping his father doing his homework. Doing his chore refers to helping his mother doing her chores Catching frogs refers to collecting frogs.<n><n>#### Rationale: The task asks us about the tense of the sentence. The question mark suggests that it has tense and it is a mixed tense. So, it would be either a present tense or a past tense. The last sentence suggests that the child helps in completing his chores and that has been done since he was a smart one. And since the sentence says that he could be seen doing the task since he has been a smart one. Hence, the answer has to be past tense and thus present perfect progressive past participle should be used (has helped).<n><n>Answer: D. doing his homework<n><n>### Task:You have 15 minutes to prepare a speech.

Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: The sentence says, why might someone want to buy beer? We should be able to determine the most likely reason why people might want to buy beer.<n>Input: The question asks about the probable motive behind a beer purchase, rather than the consequences of drinking beer itself.<n>Rationales: It is obvious that the person is buying beer for their happiness.<n>Input: There could be several reasons why someone might buy beer.<n>Rationales<n><n>1. Buying beer might have become a habit for some person.<n>2. Some people prefer beer to other alcoholic drinks and vice versa.<n>3. Some people might think that beer has fewer negative consequences than other alcoholic drink.<n><n>Input: Though there might be some other reasons also, we can rule out the options B: problems and D: intoxication by our own analysis. The reason being that a person won't buy beer in the midst of a problem.<n>Rationales <n><n>1. Similarly, getting intoxicated only increases the probabilities of having a problem. Thus, it makes no sense to buy beer while having a problem or to buy beer to get intoxicated.<n>2. Therefore, we can eliminate the options problem and intoxication.<n><n>Input: So, the best choice would be A: to get arrested<n>Rationales<n>1. It is unlikely that you would buy beer to get arrested.<n>2. Though it would help solve your 'problem' as it will get you out of your problematic situation, you might only have one problem but there can be many situations you are stuck in.<n>3. Furthermore, you're not even supposed to take this extreme action, as you still have a few more problems left to solve.<n>4. Therefore, buying beer is not going to solve your 'problem'<n>5. Thus, the sentence A: you might want to get arrested makes sense.<n>Answer: A: to get arrested

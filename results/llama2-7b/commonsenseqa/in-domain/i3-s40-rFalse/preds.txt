She blushed, blotted her face, and wrote on.<n><n>The first question I decided to use a dictionary when stuck to search for the word "sacred", since the dictionary contained the definition "dedicated to or bound up with a deity". However, in my understanding "sacred" relates to being set apart for religious purposes or the belief that something is set apart for rituals or being "set apart". I concluded that the poem was set apart for religious purpose. The second line is: "to make life sweet". But the writer is not talking about making "life" sweet, but she is talking about making "the end meet" which means making one's life less difficult or troublesome.<n><n>**Output:** I believe you will find you're thinking is correct.

Tom describes his plan for a study of the economic system of a newly emergent nation. The study will provide the knowledge necessary to devise a long-range plan to help the country achieve self-sufficiency. Because a nation cannot become self-sufficient on its own, the newly established political authority approached Tom to see what might be done.<n><n>You may use this passage as many times as necessary to answer the questions. Use it a maximum of five times. <n><n>> Tom was thinking about his project for several days. Some of his friends said that his project was absurd and his approach to what he studied was the wrong one. He did not agree. To him a person should take a serious and realistic approach in this work. He agreed that one should not be self-serving, egotistic, and superficial.<n>> <n>> Tom thought to himself: “No person of integrity and courage is going to let himself be affected by such remarks. People need to see his way clearly, and he will not be afraid to tell them what they will have to know” (Carr, Brennan, and Degges 23).<n>> <n>> On the other hand, since he was a researcher, Tom told them “The time has come to take a long, hard look at this economy. It is not that this economy is the cause of our problems. The fact is, that we face a lot of problems”<n><n>###### Question 1: What kind of project did Tom study?<n><n>Answer: A: Economics<n><n>###### Question #2: Tom wrote the following after he was approached by the government to provide expert work. What was the purpose of his project?<n><n>Answer: B: Tom's project will provide the knowledge required to create a long-range plan for self-sufficiency<n><n>###### Question#3. Tom was criticized for his work. How did he respond to their comments?<n><n>Answer: D: Tom disagreed, saying “one needs a serious and realistic attitude in this work”. He also said a person should not be superficial.<n><n>###### Question.#4: What did Tom say to those who were criticizing his work

In everyday speech you probably don't make that much of a distinction, and a lot of people use those words interchangeably all the time.  As a writer, you need to follow the rule of thumb that says to use "that" as a restrictive or defining clause, and use "which" as a non-restrictive clause or phrase.  You can use the following examples as guidelines in these situations.<n><n>Which dog is barking?<n><n>  The dog who is barking is my brother's.<n><n>Which shirt is mine?<n>  All of the shirts were blue, but the one on the right was mine.<n>Which is the oldest of the girls?<n>  They're all girls who are in the same family.<n><n>***<n>

"Due to my experience, skill, and competence, I am a very reliable engineer. My experience and competence are well suited to this problem, and I should be qualified to solve it. I believe that my engineering skills should be applied to solving the problem and developing a solution."<n><n>2."Due to my experience and competence, I see this is an issue that requires careful calculation and testing through simulation or experimentation, but my experience is not suited to it. My experience is limited to certain special cases. I would not be in a good position to apply my skills to this problem. My skills should be reassigned toward a more suitable problem."<n><n>3.

Are they thinking of “engineer” in relation to the project?). We also need to see if they are considering the problem at the highest level (i.e. will this person’s skills and experience solve the problem), and if so, if they consider that solving the problem is something that the person writing it should do. The last thing we need to determine is whether or not they consider how their skills would apply.<n><n>If (1) is written by a reliable engineer, they think the word “reliable” is the

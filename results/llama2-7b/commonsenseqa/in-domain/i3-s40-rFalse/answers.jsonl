{"text": "I think that my response would contain a lot of words in an attempt to correctly address each of the questions the instructor asks, while still remaining succinct. I believe my response will be approximately the same length as the instructions above. My response, then, will consist of the sentences above, as well as the required response for each of the sentence-questions above.\n\n### Input for Response:\n\nThe first sentence of my response should be that my response has everything the instructor asks for in the first sentence. I chose the words \"very good\", because this is an open task, and I feel most comfortable addressing the task at its core. The second sentence of my response will be exactly as directed by the question: \"Everybody has some sort of what?\". This sentence is where I believe we will be focusing the bulk of the sentence-questions, as this is where the task will seemingly come into focus. The second sentence should be approximately 60% of the total length of my response. The third sentence of my response would be the first question given. The question in question would be that: \"high quality for the money he (John) spent, but the chair (John's new chair) fell apart from what?\" The response we want here is of course the answer to this question, namely that the chair fell apart because of what? Of course it's the instructor's job to determine the correct answer, so I won't include the answer here. After coming up with an answer to the question \"what caused the chair to literally fall apart?\" you can find the correct answer below in the answer field. The third question of my response to this instruction might not be the best answer, but it probably would help you narrow down the options. The reason for this, is that I would choose to answer \"C\" (medium) in my response. The reason for this is that it stands out more than the other choices, I felt that this particular choice was also the most likely choice in the question. The fourth choice in my response would simply be the last sentence that was input to the response. Again, this sentence will be approximately 60 % of the entire total response. This response follows this structure, and does follow the instruction.", "answer": "C: closer"}

{"text": "My response would be the answer was E: unfeeling.\n\n#### Solution:\nThe first instruction asks what John did to make the death of the corpse more thorough. One can come up with possible answers, one of which is \"careful\". However, careful is defined so that one can apply a high level of thoughtfulness or caution. This definition doesn't necessarily explain what is meant by \"thorough\" and doesn't say anything about what a thorough approach would be. It only tells one what to do. This is a deficiency in the instruction. It does not tell one what kind of examination would be thorough. \"Careful\" would just be a kind of examination that could be thorough or not. This instruction tells one to perform a task, but does not tell one what the desired outcome should be.\n\nThe second instruction asks what we express by using our creativity. This is a much more specific question in comparison to the first. It also helps that this second instruction provides the user with some direction by giving specific examples of actions. This instruction provides the user with more instruction and is appropriate in that it can be a good prompt for developing the response that describes it.\n\nThe third instruction asks about an action that can happen to a chair. It doesn't give direction on how that chair might be built to avoid that action from happening. This action could describe a faulty design that makes the chair cheaply manufactured and easy to break. All the instruction says, is that the quality \"bad,\" is too vague, and is not useful in a response. Given all this, it is easier to come up with a response that describes the cause of death, expresses creativity, and describes how one uses their creativity after reading this instruction.", "answer": "C: being mean"}

Although crummy is spelled differently than the above word, the two can be interpreted as  synonyms.  The user did not say \"cheap\".  A synonym is a word that describes the same or a similar concept as another word.  Therefore, this answer is incorrect as crummy would not describe any of the statements.\n\n### C: cheap\n\nCheap is another word that means poor and unworthy; but is that quality what John wants when he expects high quality for the price?  The answer is no, he does not want poor or unworthy.

This is left to the user to come up with.\n\n### E: poor workmanshp\n\nThe word poor workmanship is not a word.

{"text": "The answer choices for the first question are \"through\". \"Thorough\" and \"thoroughly\" mean doing something conscientiously, completely, and without mistake, paying attention to detail. \"Perfunctory\" means doing something to fulfill a duty with a minimum of effort, care, or concern. \"Miss\" or \"misses\" means to not notice something when it is present, to fail to discover its presence, or to fail to use or take into consideration its presence. The second question's choices are all types of creativity. \"Craftsman of art\" and \"art\" mean a person who designs or makes things, especially in a traditional manner.  The third choice is related to the second but has a different word order. \"Poor workmanship\" or \"workmanship of poor quality\" is a phrase that means poor-quality craftsmanship. A \"boom microphone\" is one with a large or loudspeaker at one end and whose direction is changed by the placement of the other end.

{"text": "The movie had a musical score and the songs were Bollywood songs.\n\n### Input-Output:\nPuzzle.\n```\nMike's best friend is Jeff\nJeff's favorite author is Mark Twain.\nMark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\nHuckleberry Finn was written by Huckleberry Finn (not the real name of the author).\nHuckleberry Finns favorite food is pizza.\nJeff doesn't like pizza.\nMike doesn't like either pizza or Huckleberry Finn\nThis is a classic example of a chain of implication. It can be solved using what?\n```\n### Response 1:\nThe chain of implication can solved by using the process of elimination. We have to assume that Mike has good taste about movies because we know he likes a classic like Huckleberry Finn, in fact, he must like it a lot. We have to assume Jeff, since he has good taste in movies, has good taste in food, and his favorite author must have good taste in food too. So Mark twain should like pizza, and since his favorite food is pizza he must like pizza. Since Mark Twain is Jeff's favorite author, he must, also, like pizza. Mike likes pizza, but he does not like Huckleberry, and the chain of implication ends.\n\n### Response 2:\nOne could use the rules of the syllogism to solve the chain of implication. One could use deductive reasoning. One could use valid reasoning. In logical terms, this kind of reasoning is called the \u201cprinciple of universal generalization.\u201d If we can find one individual (or set of individuals) that exhibits a certain kind of behavior, it follows that all individuals (or a member of a class) will possess the same behavior. We know that Jeff does not like pizza, therefore the other individuals in the chain do not like pizza because if Jeff\u2019s favorite movie is good, so is the other movies he likes.", "answer": "C: musical"}

{"text": "**A: The first thing to realize is that the person is wounded and is probably bleeding. If he is bleeding, he must stop the bleeding before he can worry about anything else.\n\n**The best way for him to do this is to first apply pressure to the wound for about five minutes to slow the blood flow and then wrap gauze or a clean dressing securely around it. Don\u2019t try to remove your cloth if the bleeding starts again, that may damage important blood vessels.\n\n**Second, he should find shelter from the weather. If the weather is foul and the wound is bad, he should use all of his energy on treating it before worrying about anything else.\nAfter these two tasks have been completed, the hiker may consider looking for help. Though looking for help sounds like an easy task, sometimes doing this is complicated and even dangerous if other walkers are on the same trail or if help is not nearby. If the person\u2019s strength permits, he should consider building a fire to keep warm. Even if there is little to cook, a fire can be used to dry clothes. In cold weather he may be better off without clothes but without food.\n**Some people are fortunate enough to come across a house during their walk but a house might just be the last thing they want to encounter. It is often better to stay outside than to enter a home unless it is safe to do so.\n\n**Finally, the only thing that might help him more would be to find help. He should try to find a stream or a lake and not a puddle in the middle of woods. If no water is found, some other type of shelter or protection from the weather should be sought out. \n**It may not always be possible to find help, in which case he can try to sleep to regain lost energy.**\n\n**In conclusion, the hiker should be sure to take care of himself before taking care of anybody or anything else. This will ensure the survival of his body and if he is found, possibly his mind.\n\n**Best Regards.**", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

{"text": "**Answer:** C\n\n### Instructions:\n\nSay something to the effect that the best way of buying products is to compare them and be careful and thorough, and that desire or need doesn't necessarily bring the best results.  Be sure to describe what you mean by 'buying to fit the time you are living in'.  Be sure to give examples of both good and bad products.\n\n### Input\n\n#### Response\n\nI know you've bought clothes that didn't take you past lunch that day or shoes that were too heavy for you at work.  Those purchases can be disappointing.  I've heard of the 90 day guarantee that some stores use to guarantee satisfaction by the customer.  Maybe that would make it better for you to compare two sets of products before buying, but that would take a lot of planning.  I've known many people that have been satisfied with what they buy, so I know it's possible.  I think you need to do your homework before buying to make sure you get the quality or price that you want.  Be sure to check out every store that sells the product so that you know the pros and cons of each place to get what you want.  Some things can be cheaper, but don't cut corners on the things that you spend the most money on -- maybe you will lose money in the long run?  Buying something so that it will fit the kind of person you are is important.  I see some companies making a lot of money on things based on fads, or trends, but you will know when you buy something and have used it for a while if you really like it or not.  That's the time when you are comfortable enough to know whether you made your decision well or not.  You might go back more often to a restaurant that you enjoyed, but you probably wouldn't drive a car that you weren't comfortable with.  A car that you didn't feel good driving could give you stress in the end.  Sometimes it may take a lot longer to make up for the extra money a more expensive product costs, but I know a guy that bought a house based on the reputation of the carpenter that put it together.

Each is different, the first is closest to the question, because of the order. The second is a different word, but still closer in meaning - as opposed to the third and forth.  I have seen 'perfunctory', but not 'thoughtful'.  I have seen 'complete', but not 'thorough'.\n\nI think the difference in word order here could have been caused by an error in the transcription. There was one 'what' in both of the previous sentences, and that is the only word which appears for the same term twice in a row.  I think a likely cause could have been typing too fast (or too inaccurately), and ending up with different order than intended. Perhaps even different words than intended,  especially if the author wrote 'everybody' instead of 'anybody' and the transcriptionist took the author's spelling choices rather than correcting them with 'anybody'.\n\nSometimes 'thoughtful' is thoughtful enough, but 'thorough' is not nearly as thoughtful as 'careful'.  \"He did as he was required to do, but he was hasty enough that he didn't catch everything\" is in a different order, with different tone, than \"Everything went by so fast that he didn't notice everything he was expected to notice\".\n```", "answer": "C: opera"}

{"text": "Plug it into what? Choices: A: computer B: outlet C: socket D: extension cord E: bathhouse door\n\nThe correct answer is option B.\n\n### Explanation:\nThis is an example of a shortened form of an instruction. An abbreviated instruction that is written in English has a shortened form of a main idea, but the same information is still there. For example, the task is for you to write correctly and in the shortest way possible. A shortened form of an abbreviated sentence describes a shortened form of instruction, which means you put a shortened form of the main idea. The shortened form of the abbreviated sentence is not exactly the same as the shortened form of the instruction. The question to solve is that the shortened form of an English sentence is not the same as the shortended form of an abbreviate sentence. The shortened form o an abbreviated sentence is a shortened form of English sentence, for example, the shortened form of \u201cJohn was thoughtful.\u201d is an abbreviated sentence. The shortened version of the English sentence is \u201cJohn was thoughtful\u201d and the shortened form of this abbreviated sentence is \u201cJohn was thorough.\u201d The abbreviated sentence is the same as the English sentence but the shortened form of it is not the same, because the English sentence is \u201cthoughtful\u201d but the shortened version is \u201cthorough.\u201d\n\n### Input/Output:\nThe input is an abbreviated English sentence, the input is \u201cEverybody has some sort of what to express himself, it\u2019s the best way to express yourself.\u201d The output is the shortened version of the input sentence that is \u201cEverybody has a form of creativity.

{"text": "The crab was strained because he had gone from a tidepool to a beach, which was a much larger area, and was having difficulty scuttling.\n\n#### What's the Problem?\nThe problem here is that the crab is moving from a very small place to a much larger place, and is having trouble scuttling because, like John saying that he had performed a perfunctory inspection of the corpse, when looking at the larger area, the crab is looking in a perfunctory way. The crab, while moving in what is an adequate way, is having trouble moving more because of the fact that it's inadequate in a much larger area than the tide pool previously; it's performing, but isn't doing so adequately.\n\n#### What do you do?\nThe crab's being stuck here because it's not used to moving in a much larger area, like the tidepool, as it's used to moving much smaller areas. The best solution is to make the crab change it's scuttling from being adequate to being more adequate. To do this, you can either move it out of the tidepool, or move the crab to a beach that has much smaller tidepools.\n\n#### Is it a good solution?\nIt is an adequate solution, given the context. You could also have said the crab wasn't moving, but the context was implying the crab was moving, thus forcing a response of what would move the crab.", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

{"text": "We would not take advantage of our retail stores if there were other available options for us. It should be clear that the car comes with one storage cabinet (trunk). While there are ways to pack the car to get the maximum cargo space, there are times that a shopping bag does not allow the storage of another item into it. This is because it is too big, or has no way of holding up the other item or items. We would want to avoid the roof at all costs, and we should avoid placing it into the trunk because of the potential for theft. I would recommend that we place the shopping bags on the floor of the backseat. They should be on their side so that the shape of the bag does what? There will be room to put another item or two into the back of our vehicle. This, however, is not ideal because it might cause discomfort in the person riding in the back of the car, especially if it is a child.\n\n### Inputs:  What would we need from the kitchen to start cooking dinner? Choices:  Canned green beans Canned stewed tomatoes Canned black beans Canned mushrooms Canned corn Canned spinach\n\n### Response\nCanned green beans, canned stewed tomatoes, canned corn, and canned mushrooms are vegetables. It seems as though they are already going to be available. It probably took some time to decide on making chili, and there is no way for your cook to find out exactly when you are making this dish. Even if he or she did, there may not be enough notice to take the rest of that food from the pantry. I understand that there are canned black beans, canned spinach, but I do not think they are necessary for a chili dinner. Your mother needs to make a choice if she wants to make this dish for dinner this evening.

While others are talking, we're formulating what we're going to say next, or thinking about a good comeback.  At a party, have you ever noticed that two to four people all begin talking at the same time, even though nobody is raising their voice?  This is probably happening because they're all trying to talk with the same purpose.  They all want to be listened to, and they start vying with each other.  The people doing the best job of listening aren't trying to be heard.  People who listen the best have a few qualities in common.  They  don't interrupt the person who's speaking, but they do ask questions, and they use body language that says they're actively listening.  Then, after you've finished talking, they summarize your conversation in their own words, just to make sure they understood it.

{"text": "The best answer is E. That is, if a person is popular and people often come to the person,  that person cares about and is concerned about what other people think of how they seem/ what they've done and how they appear.\n\n### Commentary: To write an appropriate answer, you need know the definition of popularity. I also suggest looking closely at the context of the sentence, particularly the phrase, \"a lot of people.\"  What comes after that phrase? I think you might find a bit of a clue there.\n\n### Input to the Response:  In a sentence, which of these is correct, \"I am not used to get\" or \"I am not used gets\"? Choices:  A:\"I am not used to getting\" B:\"I am not used getting\" C:\"I am not used get\" D:\"I am not used gets\" E: \"I am not used getting.\"\n\n### Comment:  \"get\" is the 3rd person singular form of the present tense of get.  That is, there is only one \"get\", so get can not be used as the subject of the clause.  The clause used by John above is in a passive voice with the \"get\" used as a verb, and that is why he said that he was used \"getting\", which is not grammatically incorrect.\n\n----\n### Input to Response: Which of the following sentences is correct?

D: I never get a rides.\n\n### Explanation:  \nThe answer is \"A: I never get rides.\" That sentence is technically incorrect.  The question was not posed to indicate which of the sentences is correct.

Static variable- it is the global variable for that class. Class has only 1 static variable.\n\n* Method\n\n     : Method is defined for a single instance which can be invoked using the class name\n\n\n* Comments\n\n     :Java provide a tool \"Comment\" to explain your program code.\n     Ex: \n\n         /*\n          * This will be the comment for this program.\n          * We can comment an whole line or a part of the line. \n          * You can even comment a single character. \n          * 1 comment line = 2 comment character\n          */\n         \n          public static void main(String[] args)\n\n* Data type\n\n     :  Data type describes the kind of information your program can store \n        and use. Integer is a 32-bit number that can be either positive, \n        negative, or zero. \n        String is a variable that can hold text of any length, and \n        char holds a single character of text like an A.\n\n* Primitive data type:\n\n     : A basic data type that cannot be implicitly widened to hold values of another type\n\n        Integer:  A numeric data type that can represent integers with negative values.", "answer": "B: office"}

My experience and competence are well suited to this problem, and I should be qualified to solve it. I believe that my engineering skills should be applied to solving the problem and developing a solution.\"\n\n2.\"Due to my experience and competence, I see this is an issue that requires careful calculation and testing through simulation or experimentation, but my experience is not suited to it. My experience is limited to certain special cases. I would not be in a good position to apply my skills to this problem. My skills should be reassigned toward a more suitable problem.\"\n\n3. \"Due to the nature of the problem, I can provide a suitable solution without drawing on my engineering skills.

(1) Explanation:\n\nEvery time we see the \u201creliable engineer\u201d statement, we must consider all the things in it. We can determine if the person writing it understands what a reliable engineer is (do they know the definition of a reliable engineer? Is \u201creliable\u201d the most important thing to them? Are they thinking of \u201cengineer\u201d in relation to the project?). We also need to see if they are considering the problem at the highest level (i.e. will this person\u2019s skills and experience solve the problem), and if so, if they consider that solving the problem is something that the person writing it should do. The last thing we need to determine is whether or not they consider how their skills would apply.\n\nIf (1) is written by a reliable engineer, they think the word \u201creliable\u201d is the", "answer": "E: library"}

Although the machine is intricate it is not intended to be used for eating.  B: apparatus makes more sense to the question.  It seems like the author is describing a new piece of machinery that is used for a specific task.  The word \u201cwash\u201d and the word \u201cdishes\u201d are not in the question.\n\nQuestion 2:\nThe correct answer if A: hiding. The sentence states that the answer is \"how\", not \"why\".  The answer cannot be \"expectation\" because expectation is part of the question. In order to correctly answer whether the answer is \"experience\", the author would need to know what the surprise was. Hiding seems to be the best answer because it takes away surprise and it is intentional.  \"Experience\" implies that we already know what the surprise was, which is false, \"hiding\" seems to be an indication that we do not know what the surprise is. The phrase \"George ruined the\" doesn't provide enough information to answer this.  D: knowingly is incorrect because if you are deliberately trying to not disappoint someone, it is not surprising. When a person does not attempt to avoid disappointing someone, there is usually some type explanation as to why the person ruined the surprise.\n\nQuestion 3:\nThe correct answer for questions 3 is \"D: iron\". Again a question about the question.  No \"pen\" are made out of rubber or leather. \"Cotton\" does not make sense because it is not a type of material. It has some kind of fiber.  B: platinum is incorrect because if you write on a blank sheet of paper then you would be writing on a paper made out of plastic. If you were to write on", "answer": "D: knowingly"}

The program allows the user to enter only one option and returns only one option, which is 'apparatus'.\n\nSecond example: Again, in this program, the user enters his name. The program has chosen all the names which begin with 'H' and returns the name only if it contains, 'H'.\n\nThird example: In this program the user is asked to take two inputs, one is food and the another one is place. Based on the user input, the program returns the list of options to the user. For ex: If user input 'fish' and 'pavilion', the program will return 'fish pavilion' as option.\n\nFourth example: In this program user is asked to input the food and the dog is also asked to eat the same. If the food is 'pork chop', the dog will be very hungry to eat the chop. The dog will eat the pork chop. Then, in the program, the user is allowed to input 'yes' or 'No', in which the user should input 'yes' the program returns the dog is eaten the pork chop and if the user should input 'No' that also, it will return the dog is not eaten the porkchop.", "answer": "B: friend's house"}

The user will start with the most common word in most dictionaries, which is \"the.\" The machine will then use a \"random word generator\" to generate a random word from the dictionary. The machine will then ask the user if the user would like to guess if this word is the start of a famous quote. If after 10 tries, the user guesses what the randomly selected word is, he wins. The player may have at most 10 guesses. \n\n### Example:The user starts with \"the\". The machine generates \"thereof\" and asks the user if he would like to make a guess.\n\nGuess: \"t\" \nAnswer: No, there is no 't' in \"thereof\"\nGuess: \"r\" \nAnswer: Yes, there is a 'r' in \"thereof\". The word \"there\" may be a start of a quote?\nGuess: \"e\" \nAnswer:  Yes, \"there\" is a start of a quote. The word \"the\" may be a part of a quote?\n\n### Example 2:The user starts with a blank.

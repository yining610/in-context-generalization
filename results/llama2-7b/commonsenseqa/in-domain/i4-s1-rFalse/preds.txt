In order to do the exercise, you must first figure out the month in question and then convert that back to English (i.e. June is actually the third month). To figure out the month, use the table below to convert the number to a letter (e.g. 7 = F and 12 = J). For an abbreviated list, see the following code: months = {1: "Jan", 2: "Feb", 3: "Mar", 4: "Apr", 5: "May", 6: "Jun", 7: "Jul", 8: "Aug", 9: "Sep", 10: "Oct", 11: "Nov", 12: "Dec"} Note that the month number 7 doesn't exist but may be useful in converting to the next month.<n><n><n><n>Months of the Year                        |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |  6   |  7   |  8   |  9   |  10   |  11   |  12    <n>--------------------------------------- | --- | --- |

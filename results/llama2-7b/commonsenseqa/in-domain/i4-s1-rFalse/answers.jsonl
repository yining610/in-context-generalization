The program is also designed to give clues that can guide a user. If a user succeeds, they should get an alert as well as get redirected to a login screen. If a user fails, he should be given a chance to try again. Every choice on the screen should be related in a way that the program is working. For the main code, there are some conditional statements that need to verify if the input is an int or not. For this scenario, I'll have to test if the input is an integer, which is 0 - 9. If it is, it should be used. If it isn't, an alert is to be displayed and not executed. For the first case, there's a function that is being called on every scenario: showLogin(). This function needs to be tested whether it's working or not. To reach the case where the function executes, three conditions need to be verified. The first one is the inputted pin. If the inputted pin is not a working one, an invalid pin should be returned which results to a fail. If the inputted PIN is a working PIN, a \"Login successful\" alert should be displayed. For the testing, I'll have a conditional statement:\n\n```\n    console.log(\"Invalid PIN (please try again): \" + p);\n    if (validateP", "answer": "C: prepare to go"}

A chord is a group of two or more notes that are played at the same time. The word cord is also written chord and has many different meanings. Answers given to this question include hardware retails such as Home Depot, clothing stores like JC Penney, sporting goods stores like Nike, department stores such as Macy\u2019s, and electronic shops like Best Buy. But chords or cords can also be used in music to produce certain sounds. Chords can also be written as two or more notes that sound pleasing to the ear such as C major.\n\nIn the response given, the student attempted to give an answer that they thought made most sense. The response chosen was about music stores and other locations that retail musical products such as musical instruments.

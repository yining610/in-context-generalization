The second option, \"head\", does not make any grammatical sense as a possible answer because the word \"head\" is not used as a noun in English.\n3.) Similarly, \"sick person\" is not an appropriate answer because it does not provide any additional information about who is typically contracting illnesses beyond saying it's a sick person. Moreover, someone who is sick or unwell is likely visiting a hospital or doctor's office to be treated, not contracting illnesses.\n4.) The remaining options are less likely to be correct, but their likeliness increases if you focus on the question's second half: \"contracts illness\". \n5.)

As we can see in the options of question E: front entrance, F: front entrance, C: anterior entrance, and B: main entrance, these are all references to the front entrance of a building. 4. As shown in option D: current entrance, this suggests that the front entrance has been named the current entrance as it is the main entrance that is used. 5. Thus, we can eliminate options C-F and find that the remaining options D: current entrance and B: main entrance refer to the front entrance of the building. 6. Eliminating options D: current entrance, the question is asking which entrance you would use to enter the building, if you do not wish to use the front entrance.\n7.

The sentence doesn't specify who the \"one playing the cello\" will include, meaning the sentence can't be answered by the person's answer to the question.\n4. This indicates that the answer is the group's and not the person's.\n5. The rest of the sentence is about a \"group of musicians\", which means a group of people playing music, therefore the answer is the musicians, not the person playing the cello. Thus, the final answer is A: ocean.\n\nInput:  Which of the following foods are included in the Mediterranean diet? Choices:  a) bread and butter b) seafoods, c) olives 1. The question refers to a diet, specifically a Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes certain foods.\n2. Foods in the diet are indicated by'mediterranean diet', hence the sentence can be paraphrased to \"Which foods are in the Mediterranean Diet?\"\n3. The word 'and' is used in the question, hence the answer is more than one type of food, rather than one.\n4. The list of foods given, 'bread and butter','seafoods', and 'olives' are all in the Mediterranean region, making them appropriate foods for the diet.\n5. Of the options,'seafoods' is a food group in the Mediterranean, and hence, a suitable answer. Thus, in the end, the final answer is C: seafoods.", "answer": "B: symphony"}

Therefore, options A: reality, B: imagination, and C: dreamworker cannot be correct.\n3) Hence, the best answer is D: nightmare, and the listener would say that he 'couldn't tell it from what', nightmare. \nSo the final answer should be D: nightmare", "answer": "A: reality"}
{"idx": 98, "text": "1. The question asks a person lived in my what. \n2. So the correct form would be 'where', meaning the question is asking about the location that the person lived in.1. Therefore, options A: demonstration and B: conference are not suitable as these are not places. 2. 'Building' might appear to be a suitable option as a building is a structure where people live or work. But 'building' does not refer to an inhabitable place, so the question would have to be rephrased.2 Therefore, 'building' is not a suitable option.3. Option 'garage' is not a suitable answer as a garage is not where someone lives. 4. Option E: mouth would not be suitable as it's incorrect grammatically.5. Thus, the correct option for this question is C: Building since it is a place. \nSo the final answer should be C: Building\n\nInput: I am going to do what to the what in the what? Choices:A: make fun of people B: put them on the ground C: draw them D: throw them at the sky E: look at them\nOutput:1.The question is asking what the person will be doing.2. So the only action that needs to be taken is the part in bold, 'to'. \n3. This part is followed by adjectives that describe the other parts of the sentence.4. As such, the question is asking what action the person will be taking on the what.5. With this clarity regarding the structure of the question, eliminating the options becomes easy.6. Option A: make fun of people is about people, not what. 7. Option B: put them on ground is about the ground and not what. 8. Option D: throw them at sky, is about what and not people.9. Option E: look at them is about looking at people, rather than the what they will be doing.10.Thus, the correct answer is option C: draw them because 'draw' is an action that can be taken on the what, to be draw something.11.So the final answer is C: draw them\n\nInput: Who are you?

The geese will be taking a trip, from one location to another.\n2) Thus, if somebody is going in a car, then they can transport the geese. If one is taking a train, then they cannot. \n3) The same applies to guards and ultralights, and hence, option A does not represent the process.\n4) In a group, one cannot distinguish how one goes from one place to another. Thus, option E does not represent the process either.\n5) However, if a group of geese flies together from one place to another, then that fulfills the process.

{"idx": 114, "text": "1. The question tells us the woman was sick, and so she was presumably missing the event due to illness.\n2. The answer has to do, obviously, with missing out on something, so we eliminate A: resting, as that would not be a consequence of missing the event, and B: sleeping more, as that would only indicate that she may have been sleeping more because of her illness (rather than missing the event).\n3. The question is asking whether she missed out on something for a non-illness related reason - for example, if she was simply resting or sleeping for health, it would not necessarily be because of the event.\n4. Similarly, C: bed sores is not the correct answer because bed sores, while commonly associated with sleeping in bed, do not necessarily indicate a reluctancy to attend an event.\n5. This leaves us with D: missing out and E: comfort as the only viable options.\n6. As we see, D: missing out is not a good answer, as it stands in contrast to the question, which specifies that she is sick and so missing the event.\n7. However, E: comfort would be a very good answer, as it states that she was missing something important, which she would have been otherwise, given her sickness and general unhappiness about not being able to attend.\n8. Since comfort makes perfect sense as an answer, it stands as the correct one.\nSo the final conclusion is E: Comfort", "answer": "D: missing out"}

This means that John, like many other athletes, was _wanting to_ or _intending to_ divide people into winner categories.\n1. The word 'want' in the statement _'John wanted to divide people into winner categories'_ carries a more nuanced sense of intention than 'willing to' or 'going to' which is why it is used in the question rather than the other options.\n2. There isn't one category here - there are multiple. Hence, we can eliminate As (single word), Bs (plural but has 'or') and Ds (uses 'about to').\n3.

{"idx": 170, "text": "To answer this question, it's important to understand the context of the question which talks about \"buying\" Christmas presents, instead of the word itself. This implies that one is already planning to buy Christmas presents, so the option A: happiness is incorrect since happiness does not stop one from doing something. \n\nNext, it's importantly to note that \"people buy gifts to make other people happy\" to the point that \"gifting is almost a requirement during Christmas\" (Merriam Webster). To rephrase this, if one does not buy presents they will be unhappy and will receive complaints or blame. This indicates that A: happiness and D: relief have the right answer, but since A: happiness can still allow one to buy presents, it's not really a valid option. \n\nHence, the correct answer is D: relief.\nSo the final answers are D: relief\n\nInput: What is the best title for a film about the rise of a country leader? Choices: 1. The Fresh Prince of Jordan 2. American King 3. The Prince Who Saved Jordan 4. The King of Jordan 5. The Rise of Jordan\nOutput: The first question asks about a title for a fictional film centered around the rise and success of a leader.  The term 'rise to fame' is a common usage for an individual's success. \n\nNext question asks about the best fictional title about the rise of a Jordanian king, which is specific to place. It's clear that the first choice can't be the best, as the only one about a Jordanian king, it's inappropriate to use the same term for the fictional title. Hence, the other choices can be narrowed down based on whether they're about a Jordanian king. \n\nIf a title is about a Jordanian king it will contain the word 'Jordan' in it. The word 'Jordanian' describes an inhabitant of Jordan. If two words in a title are separated by 'and' it's more likely to signify a combination of the two topics than to mean one of them. Ex. \"Jordan and King\" and \"King and Jordan\" cannot work unless one part of it is fictional.

We are left with 2 options, A: family room and B: tropical forest. \n6.  In a family room (option A), a plant would look good in such a place.  So A will be the answer.\n\nSo the correct answer is A: family room", "answer": "A: family room"}
{"idx": 178, "text": "1.'Due to' fits with the correct grammatical structure. This is the result after some experimentation and testing. \n2. No other sentence pattern is viable. \n3. 'Due to low visibility' refers to 'low visibility causing...'. \n4. 'Meeting new people' does not match with the grammatical structure of the sentence either. \n5. 'Due to' occurs at the beginning of the sentence. Hence, the word 'low' is an adverb modifying the verb 'due to'. \nHence, the correct answer is E: relocation \nSo the final answer 5 is E: relocation\n\nInput:A common use for a carpenter's handplane is making what? Choices:A: bicycles B: furniture C: tobacco D: wood E: woodworking tools F: furniture\nOutput: 1.)'Carpenter's handplane' indicates that this handplane is a tool which is used by a carpenter to make furniture. \n2. Carpenters do not use handplanes to make bicycles, tobacco, wood, woodworking tools, and furniture. \n3. Thus the word 'furniture' is the only suitable option. \n4.

Looking at all the options, we can see that only A: further cause and B: wave goodbye are possible responses at this point in time.

Option C: attempt suicide is equally incorrect because leaving is done with little worry for death, and we are told that our protagonist is leaving as well.

Choices:  a. a carpet cleaner b. a mechanic c. a grease monkey d. an automotive salesperson e. an auto body repairman\nOutput: We can conclude that the correct option was a. a carpet cleaning for a living based on the following reasons:\n1. The term 'a person who..' suggests that this is a job which anyone can do, so the job options ought to be equally possible.\n2. The term carpet cleaner implies that cleaning carpets is the main job occupation, so it could not mean carpet cleaner/mechanic or mechanic/carpet cleaner.\n3. The only job that fits both the constraints is B. automotive salesperson as their work involves cleaning carpets as well as selling motor vehicle insurance.\nThus, the final answer based on the above information was indeed a. a carpet technician.\n\n# Construct a method to the function to solve the above problem in this chapter.

{"idx": 194, "text": "1) The question is asking which modes of transportation allow/enable people to travel distances by themselves.  \n2) The modal verb is used at the end to indicate the action of travel.\n3) A helicopter can of course transport people, albeit with extra charges. But when we consider the modes of transportation that are regular and most utilized, it is not a real option.\n4) While there are places where one could own a car, they are mostly in rural and non-urban areas. In a city or urban context, cars do not enable or permit people to travel alone.\n5) Speaking words and believing in God do not typically transport us from place to place in a way we can easily use.\n6) Thus, people can only dance together in pairs or small groups. Dance alone to reach a specific destination isn't possible hence cannot be an option.

So these types of tennis shoes are likely to have laces up the side (left or right) of the foot. \n6) Lastly, the shoes could also be worn on the right foot, if they are loosely fitted trainers (not dress shoes). \nSo, when all factors are taken in consideration, the final answer is a very safe choice of B: wedding as it has a high chance of being correct.\nSo the final answers is B: wedding", "answer": "A: wedding"}

The first option'salon' means the same thing as barber shop (it's the same word). \n4. Hence, there's no need to assess option B, C, or E. \n5. Now, all the options are thus related to hair, hence, all can work as answers to the question (symbolically as a place where woman's hair is found). \n6.

Choices: 1 A: go to the fabric shop and find the original fabric 2 B: replace the fabric with fabric found at home 3 C: replace the fabric with new fabric 4 D: remove from a fabric the original fabric and use that fabric 5 E: all the above choices\nOutput: 1 The word 'order' refers to what the seamstress is working on rather than an order or request from a customer. 2. The options 'go to the fabric shop' and'replace the fabric with fabric at home' are not plausible, as the question refers to the original fabric, which must be replaced if not available to be used for clothing. 3. Similarly, we rule out options C and E, as they imply that the new fabric can always be replaced with used fabric obtained from customers. 4. Option D is not a suitable answer either, as fabric cannot be removed from fabric due to the way it's usually constructed. 5. The options B, C, and E can work as options for what the seamstresses does when a customer makes a difference to an order, while option A, which refers to the original fabric and its origin, does not. 6. Based on the above, A is the most plausible answer, referring to the original fabric being the one that's removed from the garment. \nSo", "answer": "A: hair salon"}

Choices: A: park B: garden C: beach D: hospital E: store\nOutput: It is a fact that \"man on a bike\" is about to marry his girlfriend, according to the given scenario.\n\"His girlfriend\" is also referred to as \"she.\" Since the word \"ride\" was used before the word \"to,\" one can speculate that the question asks about the place that the couple is going on their wedding trip.\nAs such, we can eliminate the first six options \"park, \"garden, \"beach, \"hospital, \"park, \"and \"store,\" as they are not likely candidates for the couple's trip.\nThe last three options \"garden, \"mall, and \"beach\" are then possible choices. However, it is unlikely that the couple would go to the beach on their wedding trip, as it might be rainy or cloudy.\nIt is also unlikely that they would go to a mall as it is too mundane and ordinary", "answer": "E: front door"}

{"idx": 282, "text": "1.[1]: The question is asking what the guys in a party seemed to do. It doesn't say much else. \n2.[2]: This suggests that Jimmy didn't like going the party since it was either a 'party' or 'going party' that Jimmy didn't. Given this, one cannot use the expression 'it seemed like the guys there' or use 'the guys there' and ask 'what seemed like' as the question has already used the words 'did' and'seemed'. Instead, one should focus on the whole expression of 'party' and understand the meaning of'seemed to do'. This is done and we focus on the second part of the sentence; hence, using the expression 'were' and 'what'. \n3.[3]: This then results in asking 'what guys seems to do?'. \n4.[4]: This would mean asking 'what seems like guys did?', which is redundant with [2] (since guys are the one being referred to). Hence, this expression could be dropped. This is confirmed by [5], where 'like' is dropped. \n5. Now, we focus solely on the last part of the sentence which involves understanding'seemed' and asking 'What they seemed to do?', ie the answer. \n6.[5] suggests that the guys seemed to do two things; 'dance' and 'have fun'. \n7.[6] is redundant and thus incorrect.\n8.[7], [8], [9] and [10] suggest that 'having fun', 'dance' and maybe 'drunk' is what the guy does. \n9.[9] is incorrect since one can have fun, dance, have drunk or do anything, but the question is asking what the guy does which suggests that, 'having fun', is not correct as 'having fun' cannot be said as 'does fun'. \n10.[10] is incorrect since we have already covered the concept of 'drunk' but 'party' was not included.

Now when it comes to answering a night owl that's a 'what' at sunrise, the 'what' could be either'morning person' or 'early bird' and both can be plausible options.\n4.

But people believed that 20-24 was the best age for both if they wanted to be successful in terms of both personal and financial life. 2) In the past, marriage and business were considered best at daytime. This means that early in the morning or during the afternoon is the best time to get married and start a business, especially back then. 3) Daytime is also associated with the concept of success, as people are more active and productive during the day. 4) As a result, getting married or starting a business during the day, particularly early in the morning or in the afternoon, is considered the best strategy.\nSo the Final Answer is A:NIGHT and B:BUSINESS", "answer": "C: lark"}

Since the answer must necessarily be one of the choices offered by the question, it can be said that the answer is not an object, but a set or category of objects. One of these categories is a piece, so we can eliminate option A.\n3. We can assume that since the question limits the answer to a single piece, puzzle box will have to contain more than just 1 piece, since we know a box is a container of various pieces.

The term 'jail time' here refers not to the duration of time the person will be kept in jail, but specifically 'the amount of time a person is kept in jail for the crime'. As such, 'jail time' is a time-based punishment, not the place where a person will be kept in prison.\n5. 'Fear' also doesn't answer the question, as while fear after committing such a crime is highly likely, it does not refer specifically to the location where the person is kept.\n6.

The second option, 'happy' would make the perceiver happy but does not suggest that the perceiver is scared.\n3. The third option, 'dangerous' hints at the possibility of someone being afraid of the dangerous person but is not explicit about it, so this is a plausible answer.\n4. The fourth option,'strange' implies the idea of fear when combined with the hint of'scared of', so this is also plausible and thus safe to assume.\n5. The fifth option, 'weird', although a possible answer, is not relevant since it does not suggest a fear-related outcome. \n6. Taking the above into account, choices A: human, B: happy, C: dangerous and D: strange are potential answers, but the final one, C: dangerous, is the only one that can clearly convey the correct idea since it suggests both the possibility of a person's fear and the likelihood that such a person would be perceived as scary by others.\nSo the final answers is C: dangerous\n\nInput: What are the reasons for this?

The first option, 'do enjoy', is grammatically incorrect (to enjoy doing something, not to do something and 'enjoy it doing'). \n4. The second option, 'get laid', implies something sexual. If so, then the option is too explicit and unappropriate. If not, then the option could potentially be correct, but would depend on the specific context of the party and activities of the frat boys. \n5. The third option, 'enjoyable', is similar in meaning to 'do what tonight', but is still too generic to be an appropriate answer. \n6. The fourth option, 'work less', can be eliminated because it does not fit into the 'party' context.\n7. The final option, 'enjoying living', could potentially fit with the context of a 'wild party' and therefore could be an option, but it is grammatically incorrect and lacks specificity (in what enjoyment?).

Choices: 1. playing with the blanket 2. sniffing underneath the blanket 3. looking for the mattress 4. jumping over the blanket 5. hiding inside the blanket \nOutput: 1.) We need to determine what the cat is looking for when she is sniffing the blanket. If she were to sniff under the blanket, she would know what was under the blanket. \n2. If she were to look for the mattress, she would know that there was no mattress to start with. \n3.) Since the newborn is placed in the crib for its first time, we can eliminate the mattress. \n4.) If the cat hides, she would know the blanket is over her. If the cat jumps over the blanket, the newborn will be scared since she can see what the cat sees. \n5.) We are concerned about hiding under the blankets.

Option 'C: thanks God' means saying a prayer of gratitude for a positive change which is contradictory to the meaning of this question. So in order to get the answer, we can rule out C.\n5. As we discussed in step 2, the next option, D: experiences, is also incorrect as it refers to negative experiences in contrast to what is being asked for here.\n6.

As there is an implication here that one is waiting for transportation to arrive, a book store is probably not an option. \n4. A newsstand would serve a purpose here as one could possibly be waiting for their transportation to arrive, but it would not offer a specific type of magazine for reading. \n5.

Combinig together the implications of the question, one can eliminate A: train station since one must be waiting for the transportation on rails to not arrive.\n7. One can only read magazines while not waiting for transportation to (arrive) arrive, therefore, the correct answer is C-\n8. Since the correct answer is B, one can deduce that one is waiting for their transport to arrive while reading a magazine in a bookstore, which is D.\nSo the final answers is C: bookstore and then D: bookstore \n\nInput:Who would you see walking up the sidewalk if he or she where on their way to a library? Choices: 1. A: a dog 2. B: a student 3. C: a bus driver 4. D: a librarian 5. E: a pedestrian 6. None of the above because the man or woman isn't actually going to the library.\nOutput: 1: The question is asking who one might see if they were on the street heading toward a library. The first choice, A: a dog, would not be someone heading for the library since dogs typically do not read.\n2: B: a student \u2013 It is a reasonable assumption that a man or a woman heading to the library would be either a student or someone else with library resources (such as a librarian). But if someone is heading to the library, it means that they are going there to utilize the resources. Hence, choosing B could be a plausible answer.\n3: C: A bus driver", "answer": "A: train station"}
{"idx": 442, "text": "1.) The question is asking about what the policemen did to traffic, so the focus should be more on their actions rather than their intentions. \n2.) The choices that are given all describe actions that the police may have taken to deal with traffic, so the correct answer should be one that matches one of these actions. \n3.) The choices that are not actions, like B: direct traffic, should therefore be eliminated from the possible answer choices. \n4.) The answer choices have 4 options - A, B, C and E. \n5.) The first choice, A: hurry along, does not directly state any action that the policemen took, but rather describes their general purpose of getting the traffic moving. \n6.) To answer the question, we need to determine what exactly the policemen did, so we should pick one of the other choices. \n7.) The second choice, B: direct traffic, is an action, but we can eliminate it as it simply states what the policemen were doing, and does not relate to the question of actions taken to clear the scene of an accident. \n8.) The third choice, C: help, is also an action, and if combined with our previously obtained information regarding the policemen's purpose of clearing the scene of an accident, it would fit perfectly. \n9.) The last choice, E: corner thief, is an unusual choice in this scenario and therefore, can be excluded from the list of options.\n10.) With our combined information, we can deduce that the correct answer choice here is C: help. \nSo the final answer will be C: help\n\nInput: What do you always tell your friends the weather would do after 5:00PM or 11:00PM?

{"idx": 502, "text": "1: This question is a type of multiple choice with single-word answers. The question asks us to select the word that describes the type of movie the narrator is talking about.\n2. This means, we have to select the words that are both relevant to the plot of the movie and can be used to describe the movie's type. \n3. We can eliminate all the words which are not relevant (\"napster\" is not a movie type as there are no movies on this site and \"record\" is not a type of dance). \n4. We can also eliminate all words that cannot be used to describe the type of movie. For example, we cannot use \"jukebox\" because the narrator does not say that there is a jukebox in the movie; similarly, we cannot use \"recording\" because the narrator says the song had many a dance, which means that there were probably many dances, not many recordings. \n5. Hence, the correct answer should be a word that could be used both to describe a particular scene in the movie and also to describe the overall tone or type of the movie.\n6. A word that fits these criteria is \"dance\" as a dance refers to both a particular scene in the plot of a movie (such as a choreography) as well as an overall type of movie (such as a musical). \n7.

However, pubs are often frequented by people during afternoons or evenings, not mornings (the preferred time for most bachelor parties in western society). \n3", "answer": "C: musical"}

Choice A: wrong, is a word and not a location, so we can eliminate that option. 6. Choice D: negative or evil as these aren't locations either. 7. To choose A: death of would make sense, but we can see it doesn't fit the hint since the murderer is not currently dead and hasn't been killed. 8. Hence, the correct answer is the word B: church, since in the context of the question it's likely that the murderer was sent to jail upon the guilty verdict and a church is the place where one goes to confess a sin.

{"idx": 510, "text": "1 and 2. The word 'billionaire' refers to an extremely wealthy person, generally exceeding the billion dollar figure. This makes us think that such a person is only going to make a big donation to a large scale location or building, and not necessarily to a small organization or private location.\n3. The statement 'allowing them to... a new science' means that this donation had made the construction of the science building possible.\n4. Now, science buildings are generally made for the purpose of learning, research, and sometimes even commercial activity, such as in medical labs. \n5. The question is specifically asking about a donation to the college's previous location. This hints that the science building, though it is in the college's current location, was built from funds previously provided by the donor.\n6. Hence, the correct answer must be a building that the donor donated money for in the past. \n7. The second option, A: fraternity is not a building, but rather a separate location of people, that are usually connected to a particular college. It is not the proper location for a science building. \n8. Similarly, the third option, B: bank, is not a typical location for a science building, though sometimes banks also house such buildings, it is a very unlikely option overall. \n9. The fourth option, C: big town is not a location for a science building either. This hints more towards a different type of place that typically involves human interaction, such as a city. \n10.

A person will have been working during his college days to pay the tuition fees and other related expenses, which is not a desirable option here. Additionally, education cannot be considered as work all the time. If a person dedicates his whole life to work to pay his tuition fees, it is not a healthy lifestyle.

So, this cannot be the right answer either.\n7.

So he did not behave very seriously or solemnly. \n2. He was thought of as a serious man but he spoke like a clown, so he did not act very serious or solemn.\n3. He was thought of in a serious way, but the funeral was not solemn, as he acted like a clown. \n4. His cheerfulness made people uncomfortable (it violated social rules about funerals). It was not a straightforward way to speak at a funeral, as he did not follow the social rules. \n5. He did not speak as seriously as was expected, being a clown is not a serious act.\n\n\n6. Combination: he did not act as seriously as people expected, he acted as a clown, the people expected him to be serious\n7. There is confusion on how to speak at funerals. People expected a serious funeral, but this was a clown's funeral.\n8. He was not serious, not compete because he was funny, not somber, because he was a funeral.\n\n\n9.

From the given options, curiosity and wonder are both positive while fear is negative and excitement tends to go either way.\n4. Interestingly enough, we also have two options that share the same word. Thus, to eliminate the possibility of being confused we need to keep in mind that \"new\" and \"seeing\" are synonyms and to use our synonym knowledge on the above options. \n5.

'Human' is incorrect as it is a broad term that captures all the human body parts, including the 'hand', which was already discarded.\n6. Hence, the only remaining viable answer is \\strong{'mouth'} as it is the most likely part of the human body where 'lips' would be found.\nSo the final answers is mouth\n\nInput: Are you looking to buy a car that is fast in what manner? Choices: A: fuel efficiency B: braking C: air conditioning D: stylish e: all of them\nOutput: The question is asking about 'fast', in which case, we are looking for the factor or attribute that most likely affects or contributes to a car's speed.\n\n1. Fuel efficiency is not related to speed, so we can eliminate \\strong{B: braking} from the list.\n2. Similarly, air conditioning has no bearing on the speed of a car, so it is also not the correct answer.\n3. Stylish also has no direct relation to speed, so it too is discarded.\n4. Hence, the final set of answers is limited to \\strong{D: stylish e: air conditioning}\n5. However, among the narrowed set of options, air conditioning is the only one that stands out. Cars with air conditioning may be considered'stylish' if they are equipped with an attractive design. This means that air conditioning is the correct answer to the question because it affects the speed in a subtle manner.\nSo the final Answer is air conditioning", "answer": "A: mouth"}

We then can eliminate A: deaths and C: moving as the consequence is yet to be reached. \n2. This leaves us with only three options-B: get arrested, D: using gas, and E: may die. The term'may' is a 'not certain' word. Hence, option E: may die is out. \n3. The two remaining options are B: get arrested and D: using gas. B: get arrested indicates immediate action post the 'hit' so the vehicle could be immediately be arrested. However, using gas does not indicate immediately stopping the vehicle so this cannot be the intended consequence of being 'hit' while driving and the correct option is D: using gas.\nSo the final correct answer is D: using gas", "answer": "E: may die"}

Although salted water can also be bland, because the context indicates adding more ingredients, the answer is B: water.\n5. It's not necessary for the meal to contain salt to be bland, but salt would make it taste better. Hence, the other options of A: supermarket, B: water, C: cellars and D: soup are incorrect.\n6.

The question tells us that one might not like the weather when they are on vacation and that they would either try new things or go inside. Since the question does not provide additional details, we can eliminate the other options. \n2' Go indoor' does not seem to imply that one would go inside, rather that one would try new things by going indoors. Thus, this option can be removed. \n3' Go outdoor' refers to doing activities while outdoors, which is not likely to solve the problem of a poor weather since indoors and going home are more direct solutions to trying new things. Thus, this option is also eliminated. \n4' Stay inside' indicates staying indoors in one's room. This solution is also direct and likely to be less time consuming than finding something new to try or going outdoors, thus this option is eliminated as well. \n5' Go home' indicates that one would return home in their original state - with the same clothes and belongings as when they left", "answer": "D: staying there"}

This water form is generally found in smaller bodies of still water or lakes, where rivers meet the ocean. \n3.

The choices contain various elements of the question, including 'have to sleep', 'run', 'let down', etc.\n3. Thus, the choices A and E do not mention 'human powered', hence can be eliminated.\n4.

Loneliness is defined as the state of being alone and feeling a lack of companionship. In other words, loneliness is a feeling of disconnection and isolation. \n5) Using the above definition, it is easy to eliminate the first three options: meet people, make people laugh and socialise. \n6) Why? 'Socializing' will not necessarily help one overcome loneliness and it can still be lonely even if one is surrounded by people. In fact, socializing requires one to interact with others to form bonds and connections. To be social simply means that one is interacting with others.\n7) Similarly, meeting new people or making the people around one laugh does not necessarily make one feel more connected or less lonely. In many cases, people may remain lonely even if they meet new people or make those around them laugh.\n8) The answer to this question is therefore E: liquor, as liquor is not only a fun activity but also a useful one in the face of lonesomeness. Liquor, which can be alcoholic or non-alcoholic, can relax one, ease anxiety, make one feel better and boost emotional well-being. \n9) In other words, to combat loneliness, one can engage in the activity of drinking any type of alcoholic drink. \n10) This would not only be an enjoyable and pleasant experience but also a useful one.\nSo the final answers is: E: liquor\n\nInput: What activity can be completed on weekends?

The first sentence of the question is talking about a commercial facility where fabric is cut and customized. There are many types of such facilities where fabric is cut, such as clothing stores, curtain shops, fabric stores, sewing rooms, and so on. Thus the second part of the question is about \"where fabric is cut to order\". This means looking for a specific place where fabric is cut to specific measurements or requirements, such as a tailor shop. Given that the question is not referring to the place where fabric is cut but the place where it is cut to order, the second part of the answer must be the place where fabric is customized or custom-made based on the specific measurements or requirements - a tailor shop. The first part of the question is asking about a commercial facility where the fabric might be purchased, which could be a clothing store, a fabric store, a fabric shop, or a hardware store. Thus, the correct response must be a place where the fabric is cut, but where it is not necessarily cut by a tailor, even though it may be cut to order.\n\n## Question 2\n\n## 2.

So now it's important to take a closer look at the remaining answer choices to determine which one is correct.\n3) Considering the choices are A, B, C, and E, it's clear that A: revealing information, needs to be eliminated since it's not a suitable answer.\n4) Moving to choice B, a company could be going public to prevent being ridiculed so we can eliminate this choice as well.\n5) At this point, we are left with C: problems and E: telling all. When a company is experiencing problems, the CEO may find it necessary to go public to disclose the problems to stakeholders and shareholders to maintain trust. \n6) In comparison, when a company is experiencing success, it may choose to go public to celebrate and tell all, hence the choice E: telling all is a suitable answer.\nSo the correct answer is E: telling all.", "answer": "D: more funding"}

The question is asking for a place/location that can offer the best of both world the world 2.) The best of both worlds is usually an idiom that refers to having the most positive aspects of two separate entities 3.) Therefore, the options we have to choose from are not enough to get the 'best' of both worlds as both theaters, convenience stores, bookstores, restaurants and coffee shops do have pros and cons. 4.) Hence, the question could refer to going to a place with multiple shops in order to get the best of both world (ie. restaurants). 5.)

In English we use Coffin for the outer box or case which can be made of any material - but which always contains the Casket that is actually used for the corpse. Choices:  A.: coffin B.: Casket C.: Casket D.: coffin E: Coffin\nOutput:\n\nThe correct answer is coffin. A casket and coffin are two terms used to describe the same thing \u2013 the container that holds a deceased body before and during the funeral service.\n\nThe term \"coffin\" is often preferred by family members, while \"casket\" is typically used by funeral directors.\nIn some parts of the UK, \"coffin\" refers to the complete set that comprises the body, the pall, the outer covers (or \"cloths\"), the interior and the lid (or \"lidcover\"). A coffin can also refer to only the interior or the pall.\nIn the United States, a coffin typically refers to the exterior case, although the term \"coffin interior\" also exists to refer to the inside of a coffin.\nThe main distinction between the two terms is how they are viewed by different religious beliefs. In the Catholic tradition, the term \"coffins\" is forbidden, as referring to them is seen as temptation to sin and encourages the belief of being buried in a coffin. In Protestant traditions, there is no such belief, making use of the word less restricted.\nEven though \"casket\" has become the more modern term in the United States, \"coffin\u201d remains a commonly-used term for both the container and any part of it.\nBased on the definition of the word \"coffin,\" the term \"casket\" is not used.\nCoffin \u2013 A \"coffin\" (or \"coffin box\") is a receptacle for holding the dead body in the most secure and safe manner.\nCoffin, by definition, is a box used to hold a dead body for a", "answer": "B: wedding party"}
{"idx": 774, "text": "1) The question asks the user if they have ever been to KFC.\n2) This option cannot be true because, according to the description \"who serves chicken\", KFC is a place where you can get chicken. Therefore, if a customer has never been to KFC, they have not been to a place that serves chicken. Therefore, the sentence \"I have never been to KFC\" cannot be true.\n3) This option cannot be the answer because the customer can say \"I have never been served chicken at KFC\" without eating the chicken. Therefore if they had been served chicken at a fast food restaurant, they could have said \"I have been served chicken at McDonald's or Burger King\".\n4) This option cannot be correct because serving chicken in a plate or bowl is not the same as serving chicken at KFC that is one of the world\u2019s most recognized chicken restaurants.\n5) One of the definitions of freeze is \"to make solid like an object in a freezer\". Freezing something does not have the implication of serving it, like saying \"I have been served ice cream\". 6) The definition of oven is a place with hot air. If something is being cooked in an oven in KFC or another restaurant, this activity is a part of the work that KFC does. Ovens are not places used to consume chicken like KFC is. Therefore, this option cannot be the answer. From the above explanation, it can be concluded that the correct answer is E: oven.\nSo the final choice is E: oven\n\nInput: Where can a carpenter make a cake?

{"idx": 778, "text": "1 What is the question asking? The answer is a state of being in which someone finds it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep at night, i.e. insomnia.\n2. Therefore, the factors that contribute to insomnia are nightmares and restlessness. Nightmares are frightening dreams or very bad dreams that cause a lot of anxiety, while restlessness is a very uncomfortable condition where someone feels itchy and unable to settle, usually due to nerves or anxiety.\n3. 'Have restlessness' is not an option since it doesn't apply to the term'restlessness', but instead refers to the term 'have'. This leaves us with only three options to consider. 'Have nightmares' and 'have dreams' simply don't make sense since dreams and nightmares don't cause insomnia. \n4. The correct option is thus, B: restlessness as it is the most appropriate factor that contributes to insomnia.\nSo the final correct answer is B: restlessness\n\nInput: What's a type of building used to hold people's body while deceased?

This question asks about a building(structure) where deceased(body of dead) individuals are kept and preserved. \n2. C: catacomb(s) and D: mausoleums are NOT options. 3. 'Hold people's body while dead' makes no sense either. 4. E: urn is NOT an option since an urn is simply a container used for holding cremation ashes. \n5. 'Cemetery' is a large, open area that is used as a location for burying or interring a dead body. However, a cemetery is not a building and therefore, does not qualify as an answer. \n6. Hence, B and E are not suitable as answers either. \n7.

This answer is more commonly known as the 'edge' that people compete for. A common sporting example is in Tennis when you see a 'game, set, and match'.\n3) In some cases, like in sports, competing against someone can involve building 'friendship' and 'chemistry' with them, which can be regarded as part of 'the good game'. This, however, is not a likely answer.\n4) Another reason for competing against someone is to show 'rivalry'. It is common in all forms of sports and other competitions, as well, where there is often a healthy rivalry between two or more players, which is not the answer.\n5) In some cases, it may not be a matter of 'competing against someone' but merely 'competing' against someone. This can be done as'sport', to earn a 'game/win' over opponents. However, it is not a likely answer either.\n6) The only remaining answer is \"to discover their skills.\" This is a likely answer because it is the most obvious one and is also more understandable.\nSo the final choice is A: edge", "answer": "A: edge"}

C: Beach - Sand (the majority of which comes from the land) covers only part of the beach and contributes to a very small percentage of the ocean surface.\n3. D: Surface of earth - The ocean covers three-quarters only of the earth's surface which is a lot more different than the question.\n4. E: Rivers - Rivers do not cover the earth, let alone any three-quarters of the water in the oceans. \n5.

Your heart beats to pump blood for your whole central and peripheral nervous system. It is known as an electrical signaling mechanism.\n3.The food you eat goes through your stomach, where it gets mixed up with acid to form digestive gastric juice, which is further digested in this process.\n4.

However, it should be realized that this option does not mention anyone being given \"ticket number to the fan\". So, clearly that option is wrong. 3) Choice C: \"People enter the games for free, so no tickets need to be issued\". is unlikely due to the cost of stadiums and the large number of seats that must have assigned seats. 4) Choice D sounds reasonable if one were to ignore the mention of tickets, however, the choice does not make sense if the point of buying tickets is to allow people to get in: \"people write their name and their seat on paper, and bring the paper with the to the gate and the person hands this paper to the reader who scans it to let them in\" sounds strange. 5", "answer": "D: theater"}

The audience sits in groups facing the stage. In a conference theater, the audience sits in rows and faces the stage like a theater. This means that the correct answer to the question is 'conference theater'.\n2) Building is not the correct answer. If you look at the question, you will see that it is asking about a place where there is a room and where the audience sits in groups to look at the center. This means that there is a stage, and the audience sits around him or her. This can be thought of as a theater, but not a building.\n3) The term 'lot' does not mean a place where a lot of things are sold. This is a figure of speech that means 'a large number of'. For example, people say, 'I have a lot of money. They want to make a lot of money, or they have a lot of food. This is a figure that describes large quantities.\n4) Now we think of what is the most appropriate answer to the question. The word 'church' means 'a place of worship'. Many churches are built, but they are not used for this purpose. Churches can be used for special occasions, but they are not primarily places of worship. However, the term 'floor' in the question refers to an entire space without any furniture, so you could not sit in this space facing a large number of things.\nSo the final answers is B: conference theater\n\n##### Input: A person who is waiting in an airport if this person is the owner of an item.

{"idx": 806, "text": "1.* The term ball indicates that the context of the question refers to a game or sport scenario where one may be required to run after a ball.\n2. The option B: have legs is irrelevant as it does not answer the question. Legs are a part of the body whereas the question refers to the need of running and ball. Hence, this option is disregarded.\n3. The option C: skip is also disregarded. Skipping is another form of running, however, cannot be called as a 'running after' in the context of the question. It also refers to a form of exercise to stay fit which is not the need here. This is not the need of the player hence will not help him/her to run after a ball properly, which answers the need of the question indirectly\n4. The option D: not fat also is out of context of the question. Since, we need to 'run after' the ball, but a fat person may not be able to do so well as much as a thin person will, this option can be eliminated too.\n5. Hence, the possible options left are E: look first and A: get tired. \n6. The option A: get tired is incorrect for two reasons:\n7. First, A: get tired implies that you may not be able to run after the ball. But, what is needed here is that we don't want to get tired, we want to get going. Hence can be ruled out.\n8. Second, the option gives a negative sign of ability, but the given context is the need for a player to 'run after the ball', a positive sign. This would answer the need of the question.\n9.

The second option,B: he's just a stray dog is not suitable because the question asks where did the DOG come from but we are referring to a MAN not a dog.\n3. The third option,C: he's coming home doesn't fit either. First of all, the word 'home' isn't defined; it could mean the dog's house, his owner's house, etc. Thus, it is not enough to just say, C: he's coming back.\n4.

While playing football, you will feel elated and excited. Hence, exhilaration is a valid answer.\n\n4)  'pain' means 'physical discomfort caused by disease, damage, or physical injury'. Injuries are common in football, causing physical discomfort and pain. Such injuries could lead to death as well, but only a negligible percentage of deaths are caused by playing football.

No\nOutput: 1) When a group of people are coming up with options, the first step might be to brainstorm.2) The term 'brainstorm' is associated with coming up with ideas and finding solutions, which is indeed a part of decision-making. 3) While brainstorming might not always precede the actual decision-making, it is often associated with decision-making and creative thinking. 4) The use of the term \"is coming up with options\" implies that the group members might potentially be looking at the options at hand and thinking through the options. 5) Finally, the use of the phrase \"they are coming up with\" indicates that the group as a whole might be working towards a common goal or objective or brainstorming for something, which suggests that the group is actually brainstorming. 6) Thus, based on the phrasing and context, the answer to this question would be 'Yes'. \n7) So the final answer is 1: Yes.", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

While in a store or market, one is looking for food or food-related items, such as pasta, cheese, and other Italian specialty products, where one would most likely find a pizzeriaria or an Italian restaurant is in an area with a high Italian population. This could be a district within a city, a capital city known for its Italian heritage, or somewhere where there is a significant Italian population in general. In other words, the best answers are B: street, C: little italy and E: capital cities as they would represent areas where one could find a pizzeriac'ia\nHence, the correct answer is (B) street, (C) little italy and (E) capital cities\n\nInput:  Why do people in some provinces take longer to cross the street than others?  Choices:  A) because of the weather B) it's their habit  C) the pavement is slippery  D) because they are not used to the rush  E) the sidewalks aren't wide enough\nOutput:1. The question asks why it takes longer for people in some provinces to cross the street than in other provinces. 2. The word 'provinces' refers to individual regions or states in Canada, so the question is asking about the relative time it takes for people in different provinces to cross the street at major intersections. 3. The only possible answer that makes sense is D), as the other options do not directly mention provinces. 4. Although A) could be considered, it only describes people who are out in the weather and does not mention specific provinces or regions. 5. C) is not related to the question as the sidewalks could theoretically be slippery in any province, no matter how long a person takes to cross the street. 6. B) is a general statement that does not provide a specific explanation for the difference in crossing times. 7. E) is not possible as the question refers to major intersections and it would not be plausible for sidewalks to be too narrow in some provinces to allow for safe crossing. 8. The correct answer is D), as it is the only option that directly answers the question and provides a specific explanation for the variation in crossing times between", "answer": "D: food court"}

{"idx": 31, "text": "1) The word choice reveals that the answer involves 'writing'.\n2) Hence, the options that only involve writing are A: write an essays and B: summarize main points.\n3) Option B is discarded as'summarize' doesn't directly involve writing.\n4) This leaves one to choose between A and D.\n5) A is initially a plausible answer, as 'essay' is a writing. However, an essay is often a long piece of writing.\n6) Therefore, to write an essay, we require information/ideas that can be expanded upon. Essays often need some base materials before they can be written. Hence, option A is discarded.\n7) It's left to look at D 'to have main points' information. If the information is the main points, what is needed next is the summary.

Choices:  (A) Eat on a porch. (B) Eat in the garden. (C) Eat in a backyard. (D) Eat outside. (E) Eat away from the kitchen.\nOutput: 1-The phrase 'outdoor area' tells us that the person wants to eat outside. Not on a porch or in a dinning room.\n2-We can eliminate \"Eat in a backyard\" and \"Eat in a garden\" because they are also outdoor areas.\n3-What is not an outdoor area is \"Eat outside\". This rule tells us that \"Eat outside\" cannot be the answer.\n4-The correct answer is (C): \"Eat in a Backyard\" because it is the only answer that is an \"outdoor area\".\nSo the correct answer is C: Eat in the backyard\n\nInput: I am giving you instructions on how to get to the place you need to be, why do you need my instructions?

The options provided are: A: one material often used for recycling, B: ripped, C: wet with water, D: one dimensional, and E: crumple\n3. One could potentially leave a piece of paper outside for recycling purposes, but that would not affect its appearance or structure.\n4. Tearing a piece of paper could result in it looking a bit differently because the tear may involve cutting a part of it or stretching it.\n5. Leaving a piece of paper near a water source may result in it getting wet and therefore, waterlogged.\n6. A piece of paper can be flat, folded, or wrinkled, but it is one dimensional.\n7. Crumpling a paper makes it more folded and three dimensional, not two dimensional.\n8. Combining these pieces of information, option D: one dimensional is the most suitable because it is least altered after being left outside compared to the other options. \n9. B: ripped and E: crumples would require more changes to the piece of paper compared to its original composition. \n10. C: waterlogged and A: one material often for recycling involve more extensive changes to the item.\n11.

{"idx": 39, "text": "1 The question is asking about the president who is also the leader of a particular institution.\n2 As shown in the options, the only institution the president may lead would be the government. Hence, only D: corporation is not a suitable answer as corporations come under government.\n3 The phrase 'leader of a particular institution' in the question suggests that the president of a country is an institution for that country, as the country functions (or is) the institution that is led by the president. The president may not be considered a leader of a particular institution, as he is instead a part of the institution leading it. Also, the president is a part of the government, and governments are institutions, so this eliminates B: white house as answer also. \n4 The president may be considered as the leader of other institutions, such as the army and the judiciary, but these are the institutions that are under the control of the president. Therefore, these come under the president, and thus do not answer the question directly.\nThe only institution (amongst the given options) where the president may be considered as a leader, is the government. \nThus, the answer to the question is either E: government or C: government (Echoing the statement - president of a country is a government institution), implying the latter is the correct answer\n\nInput: When using a laptop the battery dies when it goes from what place?

Hence it cannot be the place where the battery dies as the battery dies while the laptop switches from a power source to another.\n4 The second option B: home or office could not be possible as the battery switches location whenever the device is used outside of home or office. So it can't be the case that the laptop is used outside of home and office simultaneously.\n5 The third option C: Away from power source is not a location.

For example, if a person wanted to know if they can earn money by playing the lottery, they would be most likely to choose that option.\n3.  Once the most plausible actions are selected and their associated outcomes are compared, the plausible answer stands out.\n4.  As in this case, a possible activity,'stand in line', is not related to how a person can earn money as it pertains to waiting in line to buy products or services. We would then discard this choice by looking at the other ones that remain. \n5.  The other remaining activities, 'play the lottery', 'apply for a job', 'take care of proposals' and 'pass a course' make for plausible choices as they all pertain to what a person can do to earn money. Of these activities, we can eliminate 'pass a course' and 'take care of proposels' as those actions do not pertain to immediate earning of money. \nSo the final answer in this case would be (A) apply for job\n\nInput: What do you do if you want a drink during the rain.

'Cut' is a figurative way of saying separated or removed; cut scares refer to the emotional impact of said separation or removal over the years. \n4. Joining may be inferred as a past activity, but one should not be joined to a cut scares. \n5. Paste is a thing used to rejoin/paste things together, which is contrary to what was asked. \n6. Similarly, stitch is too specific as a form of joining to cover an emotional wound. \n7. Heal might be used to cover it, but it does not seem like healing the cut scars is the question's focus or desired action, as it's asking about the future. \n8. 'Eats' is a future action and could suggest a possible meaning when combined with the terms 'cut' and'scars', however it has a distinct meaning. \n9.

It only applies to countries as a whole. So we can eliminate this option immediately.\n2: Death rate is a factor that affects how fast the population is getting smaller, but not the number of people living within a household. So this one doesn't fit either.\n3:Migration patterns involve moving between countries, not within the same country. So this one is also ruled out.\n4: Fertility is the rate at which people get pregnant, but this rate can be controlled by each individual person.

So, the man would have to prepare/groom himself so that he can impress the job recruiters and managers.\n3.The term 'before a job interview' refers to the fact that the man has to portray his character during the job interview.\n4.In essence, the man aims to look/be presented like/portray himself as a competent/capable/appropriate candidate for the job.\n5.Hence, grooming to look good, beauty or handsomeness would not portray the desired image of the man.\n6.In the same vein, grooming to look neat or tidy would also fall short of the man's objective of portraying himself as a suitable candidate.\n7.Grooming to impress or portray oneself as a beauty/handsome person is another option. However, this is irrelevant as the job hunting revolves around finding a suitable job that the man can excel in and thus, being a beauty or handsome person would not help to land him the job.\n8.

It asks, to learn(one must have) the right book(a book that helps one learn). \n3-Even though all of the options mention books in some way, only B: become knowledgeable could have this meaning, whereas the other options do not use books as tools of improvement. Hence, B: become knowledgeable is the best option. \n4-The second sentence gives us another example of what one needs. It states that, to work efficiently, one must have tools(requirements a worker needs to perform an operation/task efficiently). \n5-Of the options listed, only D: persistence is related to tools, hence it is not the option. To persist means to be persistent or to maintain enthusiasm or dedication in spite of obstacles. Hence, this option should not be chosen. \n6-The third sentence gives us another example. It asks what is necessary to have more knowledge. It asks that one needs to have knowledge, not knowledge of another topic. The only option that fits this description is A: improve yourself because you will gain knowledge of your profession by learning the right book.

Choices: 1: Tank\n2: Gas Can\n3: Fuel Tank\n4: Tanks\n5: Fuel\nOutput: 1.) Here the context of the sentence is very important. When we see the term \"gas,\" we interpret that it is not for human consumption (since it is for a \"car\") but it is for combustion in a motor vehicle. Once we know this, we can easily reject the option 4.\n\n2.) The option that we must eliminate is #3 since it is not a word. We may have been tempted to reject #5 since the term \"gas\" is not commonly used for fuel. However, the term \"gas\" has been widely used in connection with both car tanks and fuel; therefore, we may not reject the term without looking at the context. Since the context of the sentence does not indicate that a person would fill up with fuel, we may conclude that \"gas\" in this particular sentence refers to the vehicle's tank. This leaves the only plausible answer as #1 - \"a tank.\" 3.) So, in conclusion, the final answer would be A: Tank\n\nInput: In which direction will the train move from its current location?

Hence, the answer given in the hint is incorrect as it says \"to me\" when it should say \"to you\" (see 10 above). \n13.

Accidents are certainly unfortunate but they certainly do not refer to repercussions for violating timeline requirements.\n5) Also, car accidents could result from a car not being moved during the allotted time but this is not the intended meaning of the question.\n6) The third option, C, refers to driving. Driving is certainly a possible cause for any car that stops from moving during a timeline period but again, it's not the implied meaning of the question.

The question is asking why this person's favorite thing is 'cactus'. \n2.) The word'reason' denotes the explanation for why someone likes cactus, hence is a noun. \n3.)

This option can be eliminated for two reasons: first, the question states that the person doesn't usually eat a hamburgers so they wouldn't be used to the effects of hamburgers and therefore, shouldn't experience heartburn. Second, and more importantly, heartburn is not one of the possible outcomes of this specific situation. Even if people are not used to hamburgers, and hence experience heartburn, this does not mean that they didn't eat them, rather they should eat too much of them and get food poisoning.

This is the correct answer since it is the only outcome specified in the question that could happen when eating hamburgesr and is not the case for the other options. 6: The fifth answer option is E: have fun.

The clothes might be old, but they could be newer. If they are new, then they're not really forgotten. \n5. An attic or box are potential locations for forgotten or older items, so we can eliminate these options. \n6. If we think of the phrase 'clothes up where', it is a more appropriate place to ask for the closet. So the final answer is E: closet\n\nInput:A man was putting the lawn mower away where? Choices: A: backyard B: attic C: shed D: closet E\nOutput: 1)The question asks about a man putting the lawn mowers away. 2) The words'man was putting' indicates that the mower is already used. Furthermore, it would imply that the lawn mower has to be put away. 3) The last word of the sentence is 'backyard' which has a clue that lawn mowers are used in gardens. 4) The word 'away' would imply that the laund mowers are not in it's designated place, which is likely the backyard 5) So according to the hints, the correct answer is A: backyard.\n\nInput: He was going to buy lamps where? Choices:A: hardware store B: attic C D: bookstore\nOutput\n1. The question refers to a man who is going to buy lamps.\n2.

Hence, this option can be eliminated as well.\n4 The fourth option, D:'carpenter's shop,' is likely a more appropriate option. Carpenters often use levels to construct items such as shelves or furniture, and they may likely own a level. This option stands as a potential answer until the other options are evaluated.\n5 The last option, E'video game,' is not relevant since a level in a video game does not apply to the real-life construction task at hand. Additionally, video games do not actually have levels, as they are mostly based on virtual space. \n6 After assessing all the options, it's clear that D: carpenter\u2019s shop is the only one which fulfills the criteria required.

If there happened to be a specific veldt place of lions, for example a 'Lion Veldt', then this could be the most likely place to reside for lions, but this seems unlikely.\n7.

Since the option 'B: magazine' seems plausible thus far, other options are eliminated based on the answer 'A's lack of reference to dancing.\n9. However, 'A: advertisement' has an option that states'stuck inside the ad'. Hence it could be a valid answer as well. \n10. The above analysis eliminates D: webpage and E: bus, so the only option remaining is A: advertisement.\nSo the final answers A: advertisement\n\nInput: What can be found under a hat? Choices:  A.

Choices: 1. A: high school B: college\n2.  C: hospital D: grocery store E: gym\nOutput: 1) A, high school is an academic institution and as such has no road toll fees.\n2 ) B, college, though it has some road toll fees, is not something a person spends too much time in as their day-to-day activities, such as traveling to and from class, take place off-campus.\n3 ) D, grocery store, has no toll fees as there is no road associated with grocery shopping.\n4)E, gym, can have toll fees if they are located on a tollway, but even if there are no road toll feeds in the area, there are no guarantees that a person could spend their entire day just going to the gym, and if they did, that person would be using toll roads to get there and back home. Furthermore, going to the gym is not something one does every day of the week and therefore the amount of time spent going to and from the gym is not comparable to the amount of time spent traveling to and from and office.\n5) This leaves us with Choice C, hospital, as it is the only one of the options that is associated with long toll road hours.", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}

It's very relevant to consider how equipment is bought. Hence, it is unlikely that 'dick's sporting goods' or'sears' are options as participants are expected to source sports gear independently from themselves.\n4. So, B: sporting event and E: sporting goods stores can be eliminated as options.\n5. The rest of the remaining options are all possible answers, given the context of the question.\n6. Option D: mall stands out in particular, given its context and the fact that it is a place where sports gear is sold.\n7.

There are many elements that could impede a crab's movement: tide pool(A), beach sand(B), tidepools(C), current(D), and cooking pot(E).\n3. In addition, the verb'strained' may suggest a struggle or exertion.\n4. We know that crabs can burrow through soft sand. So, the only element that could possibly impede a crab is tide pool(A). This element is a hole filled with sea water(we can assume that it is filled as the crab is scuttling in it).\n5. So, the crab is moving through a tide pool and since he is straining, it is safe to assume he is struggling to move through it.\n6. Hence, the answer is A: tide pool as it is the only one that satisfies all the criteria(and could also make sense given that a crab would normally be found in that location).\nSo the final answer Is A: tide pool\n\nInput: What did the farmer say to the little boy in the cabbage patch?

{"idx": 627, "text": "1. When we get something, we typically express gratitude towards whoever gave it to us by saying 'thank you', smiling, or both.\n2. 'Looking for' does not describe the act of expressing gratitude, hence eliminates option C. \n3. Option D cannot be correct as we cannot get something on behalf of someone else, and 'get more' does not always imply gratitude. \n4. 'Showing appreciation' is a passive verb and does not show how and when we express gratitude. Therefore, option E cannot be correct. \n5. Together, this information suggests option B: say thank, is the correct option as the only other one that fits all the criteria. \n\nSo the final answer to this question is B: say thank", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}

Smog B: Blending 3. Nitrogen 4. Carbon Dioxide E: Polluted C: Mist D: Oxygen D2: NO\nOutput: 1 - The option states 'when you mix gases to create a gaseous mixture'. This essentially means that the word to be searched should involve mixing. None of the other options include this. 2 - The mix of the gases referred to is also referred to as gas. 3 - 'Carbon Dioxide' does not refer to 'to create a gaseous' mix. 4 - 'Smog' does not refer to mixing; it rather refers to the adjective meaning dirty. So it can be excluded. 5- The option 'Air' refers to the name of a specific gas mixture. 6 - The last option 'NO' is the chemical formula used to refer to nitrogen dioxide and not a verb to mix things. 7- We have to match the word in brackets to the name of the gas mixture. We know that it is a word referring to mixing gases and a gas mixture. 'Blending' is a verb that means bringing together to form a mixture, making it the word that should be searched. 8- The full phrase is'mix different gases to create/make a new gas mixture'. We do not need to search a word that has the word 'create' in it since it is implied. By applying all these rules, the correct answer will be 'Blending'\nSo, the correct option is Blending\n\n Input: What are some tools for measuring how close a team is to completing a task?

The answer to the question is'shortness of breath', as the riddle implies that the person is jogging all day (or for a significant amount of time), which causes them to have trouble getting air into their lungs. \n3.) This means that the question is focused on the effects of jogging (hence the reference to it in the question) rather than the actual activity of jogging itself. \n4.) It's easy to think that this is a question about socks, and though socks can definitely provide protection for feet during jogging, the correct answer is'shortness of the breath, because jogging causes this as an effect.\nSo the final answers are :D: shortness of breath", "answer": "E: blisters"}

Happiness is a matter of opinion, so it's hard to say a parent's duty is to ensure happiness for their children.\n6. Children should be cared for by a parent and a child must be attended to at school.\n7.

Choices:  (A) discount B) new C) seasonal D) markdown E) buy 1 get 1 free\nOutput: 1.,2. The first item to be sold before/during Holiday is called a 'Discount'. \n2. A discount can be of any kind, but the item discounted is always a different product than the one being purchased (ie. the discounted item is usually related to a seasonal clothing or a holiday). \n3. A seasonal item is not sold before a holiday. The item is sold because it is related to that particular season. It can be sold any time before or after the holiday. The only exception is when a seasonal item is also a holiday special (like Christmas trees), but the main focus of the seasonal item needs to be the season, not the holiday. \n4. It is unlikely for the store to buy an item just for the holiday. If it did, it would be unrepresentative of the store's regular items.\n5. Marketing holiday items that match an upcoming holiday is more of an exception than a frequent practice. \n6. Buy 1 get 1 is more common for special deals that encourage a buyer to purchase an item by including another item for free.\n7.

If we look into the rest of the options, we see the first three options do not refer to a place that the people mentioned may use. For example, A: play chess, though the place where children may play chess is a physical location, is not where the children have the option to hide.\n4. As we have established that the children have the option of hiding in a new location, the rest of the options are not relevant because they refer to familiar locations.\n5. The conclusion to be drawn is that E: gettable is the most suitable answer.\nSo the final Answer is E: Gettable", "answer": "C: wrong house"}

{"idx": 663, "text": "1.'Host' can have several meanings, but in this case, it refers to a large group of people attending an event or gathering such as a party or concert. \n2. To oppose this meaning of 'host', one would need to use an appropriate word that means the opposite of a large group or gathering. \n3. One could take two words from 'host' and negate them to create a similar sentence structure, e.g.'single guest' or'small guest'. \n4. Alternatively, one can simply negate the word 'large' to obtain the correct answer, e.g. few people. \n5. Another potential option would be choosing a word that refers to an individual, such as'several people.' However,'several people' doesn't refer specifically to a large crowd. \n6. We could also use the word 'individual', but 'individual' and 'few people' sound too similar and both refer to a small number of individuals. \n7. Overall, the best answer would be few people to oppose the meaning of large crowd in 'host'.\nSo the final answer us is A: few people\n\nInput: Where is the closest place to store vegetables and fowls? Choices: 1.A: supermarket 2.B: farm 3.C: grocery store 4.D: store 5.E: warehouse\nOutput:\n1. We want a place to store vegetables.\n2. The word \"fowls\" contains an animal plural and therefor it is not applicable, therefore option C: grocery store because it contains the singular \"store\". We can ignore option D and option E as they do not contain the word \"store\".\n3. The two last options are options A: supermarket and option B: farm. Supermarket contains vegetables so that option is inapplicable, but farms are the places for plants, they are a place where fowls live, so this makes option B (4): Farm an applicable one.\n4. The first part of the sentence implies that there is \"a\" farm to store fowls, and the last part mentions \"the\" place to store fowls.\n5. The sentence is asking what is the \"closest\" farm to a supermarket therefore we can rule out", "answer": "A: few people"}

Hence, the options that would logically result from such a scenario would either be problems or deflation, not not noticeable, eat cake or economic instability. \n3. These are the only options that remain after assessing all the others. \n4. Eat cake and economic instability can likely be discarded. \n5. Hence, the only two remaining options are problems and deflation that should be compared and contrasted in a further step. \n6. The option that is the most specific and logically makes more sense as one of the consequences of a failure in fighting inflation is 'problems' since inflation can cause problems for businesses, companies etc. that can lead to them closing and people out of jobs. \n7. Deflation, on the other hand, is not specific enough in the sense that it doesn't point to any potential problems that would arise but rather aims to avoid inflation altogether, which makes it less plausible as a potential consequence after considering all the other options. \n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: problems, with the choice of words and phrases used in the question hinting to the direction to take.\nSo the final answers is A: problems", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

Choices: A: checking B: credit card C: debit card D: both B & C E: none of the above\nOutput: 1) The term 'wallet' is a type of personal storage case for carrying money, credit cards, and a few other important items.\n\n2) As a noun, 'wallet' refers to the contents stored within such as cash, credit cards, etc. and NOT the physical fold-out case.\n\n3) If you own a wallet but no checking account, then you could still use a wallet, but your choice to be without a checking account would prohibit you from using a checkbook (since you do not have an account for checks to draw from).\n\n4) However, since checks were invented prior to credit cards, they are now used less frequently and credit cards are more popular today. Therefore, since using a checkbook would be a more ancient method of payment, the choice that you would have if you don't have a checkbook would be to use your credit card.\n\n5) Therefore, the final choice, that you could use your wallet if you didn't have a check book and you could use your wallets if you didn't need one or the other, the final answer is D\n\nInput: You can purchase a CD player, radio or tape recorder.

However, they are now told that they need a 'what'. Looking at the options, what makes sense if there are'massive bears' around? C: a massive bear is a logical fit as the what would be 'a massive bear' which is what the kids need to avoid as they may be considered prey.

Number 423 is a product of 3 * 141, so dividing 423 by the product of its divisors (3 * 14,0 = 42) gives 4 remainder 0, so 4 is an option. \n4. Since 9 * 6 = 63, 962 = 63 * 15, so 9 is an option. 661 is divisible by 96, so 661 * 6 = 3966. \n5. Let us first check options with 3 * 5 and eliminate: 5 is prime, so we get options with an even divisor as 2 * 5. But 423 = 6 * 41, already an even product of primes. \n6. Since 221 is divisible by both 4 and 6, and 4 and 6 prime numbers, therefore, 661 = 6 * 6 * 15, 6 is still an option. \n7.

We know that the option A: strength, stands for the physical side of a person, and not the intelligence or mind side. Thus, we eliminate it. \n3. The option B: brain, can be considered because it's a term related to intelligence however, if a person is disabled physically but has a strong brain, he could still lead a normal life and do most regular activities. Thus, we eliminate this option too. \n4. We have to keep in mind the fact that a person is disabled not because of his ability, but because of a physical issue, such as a birth defect or a physical injury. This means that we need to consider the possibility of a nonfunctional body, not limited to a certain skill or specific task. Hence, we discard both options D: qualification and E: competence because these options refer closely to a specific ability or skill, not to a physical disability in general. \n5. Now, we come to the only other option left - option C: potential, which refers to the possibility for something to happen or be done; thus in our context, it refers to the possibility of recovering or improving the body. \n6. But how can we say that a person disabled from birth can improve his potential? This is because 'potential\" can refer to both negative and positive potential.

{"idx": 807, "text": "1) The question asks about an area where there are airplanes but do not seem to be in use. \n2) Therefore, the location of unused airplanes is a 'graveyard'. \n3) None of the other locations could be considered, since an aircraft carrier lacks airplanes, planes in use cannot be in the sky as they are in motion, and a plane crash means that the planes are crashed in the sky and hence, inaccessible. \n4) Lastly, the word 'war' is ambiguous, as it does not provide any information about the location of the airplanes, but rather mentions that they are 'not being used' and hence, the correct answer is C: sky.\n\nInput: What do you see as you go down the street, even in a big traffic jam? Choices: 1. A: bustle 2. B: a lot of activity 3. C: a crowd 4. D: a crowd of people 5. E: traffic\nOutput: 1 The question asks about the level of activity in a traffic jam when walking down the street (traffic jams are typically seen when walking down the street in a city). \n2. 'Bustle' is not a valid term for a busy place within a crowded city, hence it can be eliminated. \n3. A 'crowd' is a crowd of people, so the activity in this case is people and not cars. \n4. 'a crowd of people' can be eliminated as it's saying the same as the previous option 'crowd', i.e. a large number of people. Hence, one would be more likely to see a large number of people in a crowd, rather than a large number of cars stuck in a jam.\n5. The word 'traffic' gives information about the level of traffic and not the level of activity around it. Hence, it can be eliminated since it's an indirect indication of the level of activity.\n6. Combination of all the above information, leads to the conclusion that the correct answer is B, i.e. 'a lot of activity'. \n\nInput: What is in a cage if it contains an alligator and a bird?

C: a hardware store 4. D: a sewing room E: a fabric store\nOutput: 2. Fabric is not sold at 'a book store', since bookstores usually sell books, not fabric. Thus, it is not the place to buy fabric.\n3. It is not 'a hardware store' since hardware stores sell tools for repair and maintenance and hence, they will not have fabric.\n4. 'A sewing room' is a place where one might store a bit of fabric and may make clothing or quilts, but it is not the place where one purchases fabric, hence it is not the right place to buy fabric. \n5.

A month would be too long a time for an alcoholic addict to avoid alcohol.\n3) The third option, C, states a duration that is only longer than a week. If the addict only had to avoid alcohol for a week, then he would continue drinking after a week.\n4) The fourth option, D, is the correct choice.

Forgiving attitude means that the person is free from the mistake they have committed and does not have to face any penalty/consequence for it. \n3.

However, it's important to consider the context of the question and read the options carefully. \n5. In this context, the answer could be any of the options A, B or D. Hence we need to eliminate other options. \n6. Option 'B' mentions'shame' as an aspect of isolation. Hence it is not relevant as the answer cannot include both relief and shame. \n7.

'Differences' refers to what or whom one or more things or people are distinct from. \n3. Hence 'like' and 'unlike' will be used to refer to one's or more things or people that are the same and the same ones or more things that are not the same, respectively. \n4. This is because 'like' denotes that multiple things or people are the same, while 'unlike' refers to each of them not being the same. \n5. Combining all of this information, the options that can be narrowed down are between A/D and B/C. \n6. Both D and B contain the same word, 'differences', as the clue 'differences' that we already established. \n7.

{"idx": 903, "text": "The question asked about the location of Polar Nights half-marathons. This refers to northern cities where the sun hardly sets in winter-time. This is in correlation with the polar nights and polar regions. So the question can be rephrased as \"Where are polar nights most widely experienced in summer\"?\nFurther, we can note a distinct difference between the word'marathon' and'marathons'. Marathons, singular, refers to a single long-distance running race, whereas marathons, plural, refers to a running race that involves two or more people.\nBased on this, our options can be categorised as:\n1. 'polar nights half marathon': This refers to where one would experience 'polar nights' in half-marathons (plural). \n2. 'polar night half marathon': This term refers to where the 'polar nights\u2019 are experienced through a single long-distance marathon. \n3. 'polar night marathon': This one is incorrect because the plural form is not used correctly. \n4. 'polar night runs': The term 'runs' doesn't refer to marathons. Moreover, 'running' and 'running races' can be used interchangeably. So'marathons' should refer to two or more persons instead of races.\n\nBased on the above, the only correct phrase is 'polar nights marathons'. Polar nights marathoons, however, can only be in two cities: Troms\u00f8 and Nome. Nome is in Alaska, whereas Troms\u00f8 falls in the city of Norway. Hence our options can be narrowed down to 'Norway' or 'Nome'.\nMoreover, Troms\u00f8 falls within the Lapland region, which is colloquially referred to a Norway's 'North'. This means that Troms\u00f8 can also be considered part of Norway. So we have the following options to decide from:\n1. Northern region: This refers to the northern region of Norway. However, the phrase 'Northern Norway' is incorrect because the northern region of Norway is considered the Lapland region, as stated above. \n2. Lapland: This refers to the Lapland region within Norway but can be interchanged with Norway. \n3. Norway: This", "answer": "C: troms\u00f8"}

Hence, standing is an option for the man to move (since he can't run). \n4) Therefore, the man can move only by standing. \n5) Stand is a very broad answer, hence it is essential to narrow down the possible options to those that specifically reference \"standing still\". \n6) 'Walking' doesn't specifically mention'standing still'. 'Walking quickly' doesn't specifically mean walking without standing. \n7) 'Walking slowly' doesn't specifically say 'without standing'. \n8) Finally, note that 'walking' is not an option. \n9) We see that we can confidently eliminate all the options, except E: standing still.

As the body of water can be found in lakes, pond, and swimming and aquarium pools but NOT on children\u2019s pools, children's pool is out.\n4. Lake is not a type of water (there are lakes and there are also oceans, for example), therefore we can eliminate it as an answer.\n5. Swimming Pools is another option that makes it seem like a possible answer, as the word \"shallow\" appears in its name; however we have to consider that swimming pools cannot be located in lakes or ponds. Therefore, we will eliminate this option as an answer.\n6. We have now eliminated all but two choices: pond and aquarium.\n7. A pond is a body of water, so if a pond is typically considered to be shallow, it could be considered an option. But wait! Do not ponds typically have deep parts? Yes, they do. They may only consider areas that are normally covered in a few feet of water to be considered shallow, or they may mean that it is not very deep at all, so this is still a possibility as an answer.\n8.

The banjo has been around for a long time and has origins in the Caribbean. This is only an option if the question did not say that the banjo was famous in the US. So we now have the following to go with:\n2. Banjo is mostly famous in the US. We also know that the Caribbean is probably the first to discover this thing. This basically eliminates all the answers but'music store' and'music shop'\n3. While it's possible that the music in the Carribean is so great that is it more famous than in the US, it's more obvious that the music store is more popular and more famous in the US. That's because we've already established that music store and shop are equally the only two places where the banjo is famous.\n4.

Choices:  O: walking A: bus B: car C: foot D: train E: subway\nOutput: 1 ) One way of assessing which is not a form of trasportation is to ask if it is mentioned in the list of other forms of transportation (walking, bus, train, and subway) given in the first question. This shows that bikes are not mentioned and therefore, must be a form of transportation on their own.\n2) The term 'transportation' is used to refer to the transporting of objects or people.

A 'green drink' could also refer to a drink infused with wheat grass, which is known for its health benefits. \n5. We can eliminate the other options because:\na. A health club is not the place where athletes would go after exercising, as they'd need a place that's close to them, or preferably within their training facilities.\nb.

A 'fitness centre' or 'gymnasium' is not a suitable place to get a 'green drink'. The word 'fitness' refers to physical activity and exercise done to improve overall strength, endurance, and/or well-being. Thus, a gymnasium or fitness centre is not the ideal place to get a 'hydrating' drink after exercise. \nd.

However, it is not the place to give a presentation. As it stands, there is insufficient information to determine if this option is valid choice for this question. \n   - B: garage, and C: building are both places where one would give a presentation. Given that the question is specifically about \"show how to do\" work, the appropriate location for a presentation would be in a place associated with the \"how to do work\" topic. Hence, the first option, C: building, is a valid answer.\n   - D: barn is a building where one might find tools for \"how to do\" work. On the other hand, a synagogue is a place for community worship, not a showcase for an example of \"how to do\" as indicated by the phrase \"gave a good hands-on\" in the question. Therefore, D: barn would not be an acceptable answer, and only the first option, C building, holds valid.\n3) As we have already identified the only location suitable for presenting the \"how to\" show, only the first part, A: demonstration is an option; the second phrase \"good hands on\" could be referring to a successful presentation, and the term \"hands on\" would make sense in the context of a demonstration for a good presentation. \nSo the final answer would be C: building\n\nInput: At what can you go in order to ask for help about to the problems?

A: Compliments is not an emotion and cannot go with the person asking the question. It is also out of place because a grumpy person seems likely to be the opposite of what they desire.\n4.

{"idx": 64, "text": "1. The question asks where fungus would grow and not be disturbrd by sunlight.\n2. Since fungus needs something to grow on. It should be in a damp area which means indoor and underneath the surface of the ground.\n3. In manhattan, it has been very hot and dry for a few months, with little rain, and little chance for damp areas to grow.\n4. While there may be a damp area underneath fallen trees, it's likely that the sunlight would still seep through and reach these areas in some way. \n5. The term 'grocer' means a type of retailer that sells food or other edibles, which implies that fungus would not be able to grow freely in a grocery store as there would be sunlight in the area.\n6. 'Fallen tree' could possibly be used as another place, however, sunlight could still seep into the area through the cracks and gaps between the logs and tree trunks. \n7. Hence, in conclusion, the answer remains E: 'fallen tree'. \n8. The fallen tree implies that an old tree may have fallen due to storms or other causes, creating a hole in the ground, creating a dark and damp area where fungus could prosper and grow without sunlight affecting it.\nSo the final answe is E: fallen tree", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

{"idx": 92, "text": "The question asks about a person who is likely to participate in something after getting drunk. The key to this question is to recognize the word'something', because this indicates that the correct answer should be a certain type of behaviour, rather than simply 'drinking'. \n2. Considering the two choices that involve vomiting, we must determine which of the two is a more likely behaviour after getting drunk. \n3. If someone is violent after getting drunk, they would likely throw objects or attack others, and this behaviour is more likely to occur in bars or nightclubs. Therefore, the correct answer is clearly A: violence as it's more likely to happen in a bar than in a house. \n4. On the other hand, getting drunk people usually try to avoid vomiting as it's embarrassing and often leads to fights or confrontations. Hence, there's little reason for them to fall down if they're drunk in a house as most people can manage their balance and walk steadily.  \n5.

Finally, the remaining choices A: dog'so mouth, C: garage & D: ouble can be eliminated from the options by looking at each one closely. It turns out that A: dog's mouith doesn't make too much sense in the context, as the question directly states that cats 785 tearing things apart, not dogs. 5. Likewise, choice D: trouble is not an acceptable answer, as it's not clear what type of trouble a cat might get into. It's either associated with trouble in general or with a specific situation, so it's not as specific as one might expect.\n6. After looking at all the options carefully, it turns out that choice C: garage is the correct answer since it fits the criteria. Cats often seek out small spaces to get into when they're damaging or tearing things apart. In the garage, there might be small items such as boxes or bags that cats could get into and tear around. The garage also provides opportunities for cats to go to the great outdoors, since it's typically close to outside, and the cat could accidentally slip away while engaging in its usual ripping behavior.\nThus, the final answer is C: garage", "answer": "D: trouble"}

It is important to note that a bicycle is a means of transport with pedals that is not on rail tracks. This option is also incorrect.\n3. A woman is in an airplane (i.e., flying). An airplane is a wheeled craft that is not on rail or tracks. Hence, option E is incorrect as well.\n4. Incorrect. Option B is incorrect because of the reason mentioned in point 2 above.\n5. Cars that are on rail tracks or tracks are known as suburban rail cars. In this case, the question excludes trains from the choice set. Hence, the correct answer is D: car.\nSo the final choice is D: car\n\nInput: Which of the following is not a car? Choices: A: sedan B: suv C:", "answer": "D: outside"}
{"idx": 144, "text": "1. The question provides a few examples of possible scenarios including a comatose state (C: playing uno) and death (B: death) after a plane jump.\n2. The correct option must follow all the given scenarios and be the most realistic one of them all.\n3. Hence, A: injury and D: coma are discarded as an option since they do not follow the rest of the possible scenarios.\n4. Coma is a temporary, sleep-like condition that can occur due to severe injury or illness. Thus, C: playing uno is another likely scenario that fits the question as can be seen in the given examples.\n5. Combining all that we\u2019ve discussed, death (B: death), coma (C: playing uno), and injury (A: injury) are realistic possibilities. \n6. Even if there is an injury or death after a high altitude plunge, it may not immediately occur upon landing. Instead, it could take a while for someone to lose consciousness while descending.

D: windows\n5. E: door\nOutput: 1)The question asks about a painting at an art gallery, and asks the correct answer to be the item being looked at in that painting.\n2)The painting being looked at should be a realistic scene, as this is clearly what is being depicted in that painting. It cannot be an abstract painting, an abstract artist, or paintings at a gallery.\n3)Pictures in galleries can either be hung or propped up, and should be looking at a realistic scene.\n4)The paintings in a gallery could also be looking at another person looking at them, which would provide an ironic situation. The question requires a realistic environment, and an ironic situation would not fit that.\n5)A person is also not allowed to look directly at the door, as this could provide another ironic scene. A person cannot look at an item directly, and should be looking indirectly at it.\n6)Combining these details, the correct answer must be a painting at an art festival, and should be looking directly", "answer": "E: falling down"}
{"idx": 148, "text": "1.) The question asks about a possible grade one might get regarding one's performance on a test. \n2.) It doesn't specify an actual test such as a midterm or final, so the term 'test' is ambiguous and the given choices should not be seen as an exhaustive list if one performed well on only one particular type of test. \n3.) An 'A' grade in formal education in the USA refers to A plus in other countries, so it would be wrong to assume that a student receives a grade of'see work' based on a good performance on a test. Hence, the term 'grade' is defined as a letter or numerical value based on a performance on either an in-class assignment, homework, midterm or final exam. \n4.) The term 'homework' is a plural of the word 'homework' and doesn't make sense. Hence, D: 'homework' cannot be the correct answer. \n5.) Since the term 'practice' is singular and doesn't make contextual sense here, this would also eliminate choice B. \n6.) The term 'quiz' is similar to 'practice' in that both refer to specific exercises which doesn't fit the question since it mentions grades received on tests. \n7.) Since the'school grade' term refers to a value letter or number based on an exam, the answer is C: grade. \n\nSo the final answer from this questions is C: grade\n\nInput: If one is using a calculator, would that be a what?

A person in the forest could be doing any number of things, not just catching a fox.\n4. The first option, \u201cA: Tennessee,\u201d is not a place but only a state, so we can eliminate that. \n5. The third option, \u201cC: grassy field,\u201d could potentially be a plausible answer if the fox was indeed caught in a field. However, with the mention of catching a fox, it's more likely that the fox would be caught in a forested area, as foxes are usually associated with forest animals.\n6. The fourth option, \u201cD: The forrest,\u201d is only a specific place in the question, so again, it's not the correct answer.\n7.

A fox could potentially be caught anywhere in the country, not just \u201cEngland.\u201d This could be true for other countries as well, making it an inaccurate answer. \n8.

Happiness, in particular, is one's general and most frequent emotion when receiving money. \n4. Hence, happiness is the answer that best fits the question. \n5. Paying bills, as the question indicates, is not the correct answer.  \n6.Frustration is another feeling related to bills that might occur after paying them. However, even though one may feel frustrated at the end of the day, this emotion in itself is not directly related to getting paid. \n7.

The subject 'Bob' implies that the action (running) was also carried out by Bob.\n2. 'From' can only be the start of a sentence in this context, implying that Bob started his journey at the corner store.\n3. The preposition 'from' is followed by a gerund phrase (verbing noun), further confirming that the action of running began at the corner store. \n4. 'To get home' implies that the journey eventually reached its destination: the home of Bob.\n5. We can conclude that Bob ran from the corner store to get home. \n6. The options do not make sense if Bob didn't carry out the running part of the journey.\n7. Option A: 'a bed of nails' is implausible, as barefoot running on a nail bed would not result in foot pain.\n8. Option B: 'town' doesn't make sense either, since town implies a larger place with the implication of more roads and paths to consider.\n9.

But again, there is no specific reference to the new discovery in this option, so it is excluded.\nc)Discomfort: This could potentially work, since the new discovery might cause discomfort or awkwardness between parties, and continuing the conversation could alleviate that. But again, there remains no direct link between the discovery and the conversation, so it is not the correct answer.\nd)Misunderstanding: This might work, given that the new discovery could result in a misunderstanding between the two parties. The misunderstanding could then be resolved by continuing the conversation and clarifying the situation. But again, in the end, there is not enough evidence to definitively link the discovery with the ongoing conversation.\ne)Learning: This option stands out as a possibility, which is supported by the context of the question, since the discovery would seem to have resulted in new information acquired by the two parties.

The options we're given are sellers of groceries: \n- baker - specializes in making bread/cakes.\n- butcher - specializes in selling meats.\n- fruit - sells fruits and vegetables.\n- dairy - sells milk, cheese, etc.\n- greengrocer sells vegetables.\n- general merchant - a seller of any kind of food.\n3. Option A: baker does sell bread, but that's not a grocery item normally sold at supermarkets and grocery stores. Bread is generally sold at bakeries or at the homes of bakers.\n4. Options B: butcher and C: fruit both sell meats and fruits respectively, but they are not the store or establishment where we go to purchase items like these. Butchers sell meat, and fruits and vegetables are not generally sold in butcher shops. We can eliminate B and C.\n5. Option D: dairy sells items such as milk and cheese, but these items are not typically bought as grocer", "answer": "D: field"}

The correct answer will be a place where a person can play squash: squash is a game that requires a squash court. We cannot eliminate these options: \n- a squash court is a place where the friend came from (answer D), but it is not the place where the other person waited (answer C);\n- a pool is a body of water and cannot be squash (answer A); \n- a park (answer E) is a possible place where squash could be played, but it is not a place where squash could have been pre-arranged; \n- a fitness centre (answer B) could have been one of the squash court's nearby facilities, but not the place where the friend will come to.\n3. From the evidence, the only possible answer would be the \"rich person's house\" (answer C).\nThis house would be where squash is pre-arranged, the squash court is built inside the house, and the friend would have come directly to the squash court.\n4. Even if the friend has thought that the waiting place was the other one (answer E), it would be unnecessary because the friend had no idea of the squash court existence, and the friend would never use the fitness center (since it is different from the squash sport). \n5. The friend could consider himself as going to the public park (answer E) instead of getting directly to squash because he is already there.\nIn this case, the friend could have arrived at the public park instead of the squash court. \n\nThe most sensible and only possible answer would be answer C: 'the rich person's house'\nSo the final answer to this set of questions is choice C: rich person's home", "answer": "D: park"}

Hence, as none of the options give us clarity, D: likely becomes a strong candidate.\n4. This option is eliminated because it gives us a feeling of being likely to be close. However, what we're being asked is how they feel. Thus, D is ruled out and we have a plausible option to work with.\n5. As our other options have already been disqualified, E: Close is the only option left which is quite plausible. It can refer to both feelings and actions.

Behind the cabinet: Since pantry, kitchen, and shelf do not involve canned goods, cabinet is the only valid option.\nb. Behind the panty: As a place to store canned goods is referred to as a pantry, it stands as a valid option. However, one might misinterpret the question, considering that \"canned goods\" and \"pantry\" are both mentioned.\nc. Behind the kitchen: Canned goods are usually kept in a kitchen, but here there are too many words so one can misinterpret the question.\nd. Behind the cupboards: The word \"cupboards\" here is not valid; it either needs to be singular (\"cupboard\") or plural (\"cupboards\" or \"cupboards\").\ne. Behind the shelves: The word \"shelf\" is plural and refers to a shelf as a surface or a rack, so this does not apply.\n7.

Oil gets used up too Much\nOutput: 1.'Tires and bumps can damage' is not a suitable answer since damage usually means to create the same effect or do irreversible harm to things, but a bump on a road, though they might be bad for cars, are generally not harmful. \n2.'Cars have to work hard' can be eliminated as a suitable answer too since there are many other reasons for bumps on a road being bad than cars having to work hard.\n3. 'Brake pads wear out' can be eliminated too as it's also not the main cause. \n4. 'Cars require more maintenance' could also be eliminated as a valid answer since there are many other factors at play other than requiring more maintenance.\n5. 'Fights with other drivers' is not a good suitable answer either. \n6. 'Oil gets used up too much' while not an invalid answer could be disregarded as it's not a main factor.\n\nBy carefully reasoning", "answer": "B: intelligent"}

And the correct answer to that question was B: being annoyed, which stands as a hint for us to go with the next possible option.\n2.) The current question is asking for a description of what was happening in the situation of the queue at the grocory store. The answer should therefore describe something happening in the queue at the grocer's store. \n3.) Delays in queue means that all was not as it should be in the system, which is not what we are looking for, so we can eliminate that.\n4.) Same goes for being annoyed in the queue - it describes one's emotions, like one being annoyed when someone is standing in a queue somewhere and people in front are loud, and we can eliminate it because it is not what is happening in the system, but in fact emotion itself.\n5.) The next option, B: being annoyed does describe what was happening to the children, so it stands as the next possible answer, but we should not assume anything at this stage.\n6.) The final or remaining option is the one standing as the correct answer to the previous question.

{"idx": 320, "text": "1 The question asks about the playroom of a child who is spoiled, meaning the child is rich, spoilt and bratty. \n2 It is unlikely that a small child would have a room as big as even a typical house, let alone one massive even by comparison. \n3 The child is probably still too young to attend school, so not a preschool student. \n4 A building often encompasses a nursery school, preschool and other facilities. Children would not spend most of their playtime in the building, hence such a location is not what the question is hinting at. \n5 The building the child resides would be large, but not that large, so C: preschool is likely. \n6 Some buildings might contain retirement homes, but if this child is spoiled, it is probably a massive house the child lives in. \n7 When looking for an answer that fits the clue of'many rooms' in the child's massive house, option B: nursery would make sense as there would be numerous rooms in a nursery. \n8 Combining all information, the final answer is B : nursery\n\nInput:A business has decided to stop doing what?

Therefore, the correct answer should be one that will keep the turkey fresh. \n3. For example, the freezer keeps things cold enough to prevent spoiling. Hence, the answer should most likely be A: refrigeratoe as it is a place or thing that keeps things cold enough for it not to spoil.\n4. Also, the turkey needed to be put in a location where there is no danger of it spoiling as indicated by the phrase 'keep'. Hence, the fridge/refrigerator would seem more fitting. Also, to answer the question, we needed to keep the turkey refrigerated. But keep and refrigerated may be interchanged and thus, a refrigerator was used over refrigerations.\nSo the final, correct answer is A: refrigerater", "answer": "B: fridge"}

{"idx": 348, "text": "In order to answer the question correctly, it must be considered as a whole. It must be looked at as to what could be taken away and what should be kept intact.\n1. The use of 'to take home' suggests a place which is not 'home' itself.\n2. 'operatic' implies that an operatic clarinet is required.\n3. The use of 'opera house' suggests that the question asks about operatic clarinets and that they are to be purchased at the opera house.\n4. This answer however, is incorrect as the instrument referred to is the bass clarinet and not the 'operatic clarinet'.\n5. Therefore, looking at the question as a complete sentence, it should be inferred that it asks for the location to buy an instrument of the kind used in opera.\n6. The use of 'bass' clues in the listener to the fact that the instrument could be the bass clarinet. This is indeed the case for both the 'bass' in the operatic context and the bass clarinet in general.\n7. Therefore, the only answer option that makes sense is the choice 'A: orchestra'\nSo the final answer would be A: orchestra\n\nInput: What kind of a boat is this in the lake?

The options in the choice list are things one feels depending on how the person one's playing with behaves. \n3. Thus, it is important to note that an outcome is not a feeling. \n4. In this question, the outcome we are looking for is the feeling one becomes after playing aggressively. It is thus imperative to eliminate answer choices where the outcome is a feeling. Hence, B (Laughter), E (Happiness), and D (Fun) can be discarded.\n5. It is also logical that C (Injury) cannot be the correct answer as an injury to oneself is not likely if one is playing with a partner who is playing too aggressive.\n6. Thus, the only remaining option is A (Hunger). Hunger is something we feel when we have eaten very little for a long time. Therefore, the statement makes sense when we consider that a person playing aggressively plays for a long time and burns a lot of energy. Hence option A (Hunger) is the correct answer as this is the only feeling we can logically get from a person playing aggressive.\nSo the final Answer it is A: Hunger as its only logical as a person playing aggressiveness burns a lot of calories and energy and they will most likely feel hungry.\n\nInput: Are you a musician if you write music?

The options in the select list have this quality as well.\n\n3) As such, the options which have this attribute of writing music or not writing music can be eliminated, leaving us only with Yes and No.\n\n4) If one is writing music, it goes without saying that the musician is a composer. However, one does not have to be a composer to be a musician. One just needs to be associated with the profession of music and thus the correct answer is No.\n\nSo the final answer it is No\n\nInput: When you play a good match, are you a good player?

They have more to do with the context of sharing, rather than specific people. \n4: Option A is only relevant if we are talking about two people, as it would describe the connection between finger and skin, rather than between skin and the other factors. \n5: Option B refers to someone\u2019s own health, not to who they share it with. \n6: Option C describes a relationship with a particular person. Although this is a plausible answer, not all relationships between two people are equal or have the same context. \n7: Only Option E describes the relationship of two people as equal or having the same context. The statement \"may share\" suggests that the relationship is possibly equal or similar.

This option is implying that the person actually did die if they were not acting dead. 5) 'Die' is a possibility, but not the only option since the question does not explicitly state that it is a person falling from a mountain that will usually lead to death. 6) 'Rush' seems like a reasonable answer, but does not specifically fit the given circumstances. Therefore, as much as rushing downhill would likely lead to injury.

So therefore the place where one should usually store items like these are in a cellar or refig. \n2. A shelf is not related to storing food. \n3. A cupboard is a generic box with shelves, similar to a refrigerator/cellar, but could also be used for other things, like storing towels, clothes, etc. Thus, it's not a suitable option.\n4. A grocery store does not contain farm produce. \n5. Hence B: cellar or C: refrigerators are the correct options. \n6. So the final answer is B or C: refridgerator/cellar.\n\nInput: Where did you place your pencil while I was teaching you multiplication? Choices: A: desk B: window C: door D: chair E: stair railing\nOutput: 1.'stair railing' refers to steps of a staircase, so the correct option is E: stair raial\n2. The words 'place' or 'placement' refer to where something is positioned in space. To make a good deduction one needs to know a few more details about the problem.\n3. Multiplication is a concept of maths or mathematics not something that is 'being taught to you'.\n4. In a classroom, the desk or chair can only be used for one student at a time, making them a less-likely choice.\n5. Window, means opening in a building, from which one would take in light. Thus, E: stair rail, means the position of the pencil on the steps of a stair.\n6. In the staircase, the steps are the stair railing and the stair railing or staircase itself is not necessarily a good place to put a pencil to use. Thus E: stair raiing.\nSo the final ans\nAnswer:\nstair raial", "answer": "E: grocery store"}

As per the definition of a beauty salon: a shop that provides beauty or health treatments such as haircuts and styling, manicures, and pedicures, it's safe to assume that the answer would be a place that provides beauty or health services.\n1. The question asks what could there be in a 'beauty' salon. But the choices don't specify only those 'beauty' services which can be categorised under beauty salon.\n2. The term city, while relevant, doesn't match the intended scope.\n3. Similarly strip malls consist of different shops that sell various products such as food, clothing etc. A beauty shop is a specific shop which provides only beauty or health services, not a place where one can buy multiple items.\n4. The term clerk is not associated with any specific workplace setting or type of work and therefore is irrelevant.\n5.

{"idx": 620, "text": "First of all, this question needs more context. What spray is this referring to? Is it a perfume or a hygiene? It could be anything. \n2. Now, to get the correct answer, we need to understand the word'sooner'. It means quicker, sooner or faster than. Based on it, the woman would prefer to do something quicker than what she doesn't like, which is perfume. \n3. Next, we need to understand what the woman DOES NOT like, which is perfumes. \n4. To get the correct answer, based on everything above, we need to take the sentence'she'd sooner just spary herself with water than the smell of perfume' and swap the words 'perfume' with another type of smell she does not like. \n5. Hence, option A: perfume can be negated to option E: puddles by adding 'the smell of'.\n6. Option C: air is neither more pleasant or more accessible than swamp or puddles.\n7. Options B: air and E: puddlers are also negated by adding 'the smells of'.\n8.

There are several steps and actions one can take to get good grades and each of the chosen answers provides a different aspect of the process.\n3. The first answer, 'feel proud,' describes a feeling of satisfaction, but doesn\u2019t specifically say what one did to achieve it. It doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that one got good grades.\n4. The second answer, 'try to learn,' is a good option as it suggests that one is actively taking steps to obtain better grades.\n5. The third answer, 'need assistance,' indicates that one needs help in achieving good grades and might not be able to take adequate steps on one\u2019s own. For example, a person who experiences learning difficulties may need tutoring or special classes to receive the instruction they need and support to understand the material.\n6. The fourth answer, 'thank god,' is a religious statement not related to the question, and so it\u2019s not appropriate.\n7. The last answer,'read alot,' provides one way of getting good grades by reading about whatever subject is covered in the class.

Choices: 1. A: wallet A: grocery 2. B: library C: purse 3. C: park D: bedroom\nOutput: 1.] INPUT => A1. The question asks where your wallet is probably if you forget the grocery. \n2. A library, a park, a bedroom, and a purse are all places where your wallet isn't likely to be. \n3. Your wallet is most likely in your home's purse, where you usually keep it. \n4. There is no possibility that the grocery will hold your wallet, so that's not an option. \n5. However, a library might seem like a plausible option since it's a place of learning, where you may have left your wallet in a study cubicle to be forgotten.\n6. A park is not relevant in this context since it's not an indoor space where one would typically leave their wallet. \n7. A bedroom, on the other hand, is a place where one might store and retrieve their valuables like a laptop or cell phone, but not a wallet which is more practical to keep in a wallet, hence the incorrectness of this option.\n8. Thus, the correct option is B: library, where one may have left their wallet if they were looking for a book.\nSo the final option is B: library\n\nInput: Why is your heart healthy if your eating vegetables and nuts?

In our context, however, since we are looking for a parking lot, we can only eliminate this option. 4: The third option, C, refers to airports and is an equally unsuitable solution. \n5: The forth option, D, refers to shopping malls. This is a plausible answer, given that shopping malls are large, enclosed areas where numerous vendors sell their goods, often accompanied by food and entertainment. \n6: The fifth option, E, refers to the area surrounding a train station. This is a plausable answer. \n7: Comparing all the options, we can conclude that D: shopping mall is the correct answer.

{"idx": 708, "text": "1) The question starts out by mentioning a cannon. The cannon is a specialized weapon used in warfare, so the question will be about warfare. \n2) The mention of overkill could be used to describe a situation involving excessive force. This could be referring to a situation where one uses excessive force to solve a problem, or it could be referring to a specific weapon used to solve a problem, such as a gun or a knife. Hence, the use of overkill could imply using a weapon of excessive force. \n3) Based on the information above, the best answer choice to shoot at is body armor. Body armor is typically worn by military and law enforcement personnel to protect against bullets and other projectiles. It would be an appropriate target for overkill because using a cannon to shoot at body armor would be excessive force.  Note that other options such as ungulate, bomber, kill people, or animal can be eliminated as they are not specific body armor. \n4) Body armor would be appropriate if James was shooting at a target like someone who is wearing body armor to protect against bullets(a return to the question's word'seeking lunch). If he was shooting at ungulate, bomber or animal then it would be inappropriate as the question was about something that wears body armor.\nHence the final answer will be B: body armor.", "answer": "B: ungulate"}

The question also mentions that a steakhouse is a restaurant that serves steak, and that home is also a possibility.\n3. With this information, we can eliminate Mexico as they do not have cornfields.\n4. We could also eliminate Utah and home as they refer to different locations.\n5. Taking the rest together, we can confidently deduce that Nebraska refers to a place where there are cornfields, and is a steakhouse to boot, making the question ambiguous since we do not know which steakhouse specifically to refer to. \n6.

Choices for the verb to move away from are as follows: (1) move a way from the puddle (WRONG - There is in no \"A\" or \"P\" in the word puddling). (2)Moving away from the puddling (WRONG - \"puddling\" is not a verb).\n5. Choices for the the verb to lay are as follows: a. laying = adjective (there is no a as the 6th letter in puddll). b. lay on = verb (there is no E as the 5th letter in puddl).\n6. Choices for the verbs to sweat or to movement have no reason as this question is already written as in what a way a person could end up stopping standing in puddle.

Therefore, the answer appears to be between choices A: grief and E: happiness, since these options directly reference abandonment or a divorce - although there is still no single concrete answer that fits these situations perfectly.\nSo the final correct answer is E: Happiness\n\nInput: Name a type of item that can be used in several industries?

{"idx": 792, "text": "1)The question is asking about the ability to entertain or to be entertaining, either oneself or for others. This is a talent or a skill that many people have, not just one person in particular. It requires the ability to interact with others in a manner that entertains and to be able to relate to a wide variety of people. \n2)The key clue in the question is the term \"knack for entertaining.\" A knack is a natural ability to do something. By this definition, everyone does not have a knack for entertainment, since not everyone has the natural ability to do it well or make it enjoyable. The term \"everyone said\" indicates that this knack was recognized in her by others and that it was a notable skill that she possessed.\n3)Talent is an aptitude or capacity for doing something very well. People generally have only one or two talents, such as music, art, or acting. Some people are very talented athletes or athletes who excel at multiple sports.\n4)The question states that everybody said she had a knack for it, implying that not everyone had that same knack, or ability, for entertaining. Thus, the correct choice is B: talent. This is the key in arriving at the answer, remember to include this information\nSo the final answer should only be B: talent", "answer": "B: talent"}
{"idx": 796, "text": "1:The question was, \"Dave put his beet where he could get to, but it would be of the floor\"\n2. To answer a question about where something is put we have to analyse the meaning of the phrase.\n3. In this case, we can identify the key word 'it' in this question. It's not specified what the object is or where it is, thus, it's the object in question.\n4. The answer options are either a place where one can get to or a place where one can't. \n5. Based on this, we understand the answer options have to meet both of these possible scenarios, which will ensure the object in question (beer) can be retrieved.\n6. Answer options that do not meet both will be eliminated. \n7. The first option,'refrigerator' is a place to get to the beer from but would not be a suitable place for the beer to be as it is already on the floor. \n8. The 'closet' refers to a place where one could not get to (from the floor) the beer, thus, this is also eliminated.\n9. The same is applied to the option, 'can'.\n10. This leaves us with two options:'shelf' and'soccer game'.\n11. 'Soccer game' cannot be a place to retrieve beer from the floor, thus we are immediately eliminated.\n12. Based on this assessment, we come to the conclusion that'shelf' is the correct answer as it is a place where one can access the beer from the floor.\nSo the final outcome is C:'shelf'.\n\nInput:I want all the information that doesn't fit in his computer case.

All the answers start with a room, but computer cases do not go into rooms or drawers. This makes them excluded.\n3. Thus, D: Everything else is the correct answer.\n\nInput: Where I did and where I am Choices:  A  B  C  D  E", "answer": "D: shelf"}

A person in charge of a task or project is supposed to have the required knowledge, so another person with existing knowledge would not be necessary.\n5) The fourth choice D: take charge should be eliminated as well as we cannot tell if someone needs to take the charge themselves or if they are in charge already.\n6) The final choice E: boss is the correct answer. A person in charge looks for people who take charge and who are bosses.\nSo the final is answer is E: boss\n\nInput:Which of the following is correct when people are making something for sale?

We can eliminate options A and B because people do not buy things that are easy or cheap just simply because they are. A product should be functional, easy, or affordable to use.\n3. We can also eliminate B because it refers to 'what people buy'. Hence, we are not looking at what people buy, but rather what to do in order to make something.\n4. The second option, E: People buy something that is easy to use should be eliminated. This may be true for some, but in general, people do not purchase products solely because they are easy to use. Even though this may be a factor in buying, it's not a deciding point. The correct answer is thus E. \n5. The third option, option D: which has been sold many times is also not correct, as people do not necessarily buy something that has been sold many times, more so if it is something", "answer": "C: have knowledge"}

Choices: \tA: he got an allergic reaction to some nuts B: it was very cold C: he was getting dressed D: it needed to be repaired E: it was a custom\nOutput: The first thing we need to focus on is what are clothes used for. clothes, especially ones made from material are used to protect the body against cold and other harmful conditions. Then we ask ourselves, when is it cold in the area? The 2nd thing we see in the question is that it is a little snowy and it is cold in the morning and evening. The 3rd thing is the answer of the question is about a robe. In that robe there is a sleeve which covers the hand which can indicate cold weather. The 4th and final thing we see is that even in hot weather one can wear a robe to protect them against the cold weather. The answer is C: he was getting dresses, he was about to go outside. so his robe is covering his hand which can indicate coldness. So from this question we can learn that clothes are used for protection and the only thing which gives protection against the cold is warm clothes. So the correct answer is C: it is getting dresses\nSo the final answer were C: he was getting done in a robe means protecting his hand which is always bare.\n\nInput: Which are the animals that can be used to measure the size of a fish?

It also would not be audible and present all over a room. \n5: Dreaming could be heard by people close to the person dreaming or by themselves, but it is not audible for people who do not share a room or know the person personally. \n6: Talking is a verbal form of communication and not necessarily associated with going to sleep. 7: Based on the above information, the human sound made when going to sleep is most likely dreaming.\nSo the final option is D: dreaming\n\nInput: When taking a short cut what sound does a human make?\nChoices:  A: a short sound B: a long sound C: a happy sound D: a sad sound E: a loud sound\nOutput: 1 The question asks about a human sound when taking a short cut. \n2: Although short sounds are shorter in length, a short cut is the other way around. \n3: A happy sound is not necessarily the sound that a human makes when taking a short cut, as one can be happy either when taking a short cut (if the short cut saves time or is easier) or when not taking one. \n4: A sad sound is also a human sound, but again, it is not necessarily made when taking a short cut as one may be sad about taking a long route or not saving time, not a short route. 5: A loud is a human sound but not necessarily made when taking an easy short cut. 6: A long sound is a possible option, but it could also indicate a route that a person is taking when taking a short cut instead. \n7: Based on the information above, the best answer should be a short sound as that indicates that the route taken is shorter.\nSo the final final answer is A: a short sound", "answer": "C: snoring"}
{"idx": 816, "text": "1) The question requires us to identify which of the choices is the opposite of a 'village'. \n2. The most basic definition of a 'villge' is a cluster of buildings housing a small community of people (e.g. a town or township). \n3. Therefore, the choices that do not meet this criterion include E: 'tribe' and B: 'africa', as they don't house an urban community of people. \n4. On the other hand, options A: 'rural area' and D: 'big city' could possibly fall into this category. However, we must evaluate whether these options are the antithesis of 'village' by conducting a logical analysis of the information provided about them. \n5. Analyzing the options, it's apparent that A: 'rural village' means a remote settlement located away from cities, towns, and other built-up areas. In contrast, a village is usually located within a city or near it. Thus, it's clear A: (rural area) is not the opposite of a village. \n6. Similarly, D: (big city) is not the opposite. A village is a small residential community located in a rural area or near a city. Hence, there's no logical connection between big cities and the term 'village'.\n7. This leaves A: 'rural' and D: 'city' as the only plausible options. However, we can evaluate whether A: 'rural-city' is the intended inverse of village by further scrutinizing the meanings of each word in context. \n8. Analyzing each word in turn, we can see that A: 'rur' means rural, and that A: 'city' implies living in a town or city. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 'city'. The word 'village' describes a small residential community set within a large urban area, which is quite the opposite of 'city'.\nSo the final answer it's D: city\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions to the best of your ability.\n\n\n### Question 1\n\n\n### Answer:A\n\n\n# Question 2\n\n\n### A\n\n### B\n\n\n### C\n\n### D\n\n\n###", "answer": "D: big city"}

Choices: A: The best place to leave your bicycle B: No dogs or horses, however, cats are welcome C: No motorcycles or bicycles D: No children allowed E: No trespassing\nOutput: 1 'Sign on the roof' means roof. 2. So \"No dogs or horses, however cats are welcome\" means no cats are allowed. 3.

Each of these places have a distinct function of their own, which differs from place to place. 3. Hence, any of these places can be tagged as 'important', hence the given choice.

So the answer is Town hall. \n\nInput: Your friend", "answer": "C: lake"}

Hence, A: charming is eliminated because that is not a location or place.\n4. Hence, B: space shuttles is also eliminated because that is referring to an aircraft, not 'a place(where one can find air that has been recently breathed by many people).'\n5. The house does not appear to be a place where one might find many people breathe in recent air, because houses are relatively small and not as large in area as the surface of the Earth, so they are also eliminated.\n6. While the train station does seem like a likely location because it's often crowded and populated (with many people), it's still not enough to determine it as the exact 'place' mentioned in question because the information clearly states that'many can recently breathe,' meaning a lot of people, rather than just a few.\n7.

Options which include 'understand' could be potential answers. But if Mark wants to know the truth, he may not necessarily understand it. We can remove these options.\n4. Other options which include 'are there' and 'between' do not specify what truth is, so we can remove them as well.\n5. Thus, we have the potential answers:\n- Mark wanted to *know* the truth.\n-Mark didn't want to *existing* in ignorance, as he wanted to know the truth rather than remain ignorant.\n-Mark wanted to not *be* in-between, as he wanted to be sure there was truth rather than assume it would be in-between ignorance and truth.\n6. Option 'D: in-between' is the only option to have a chance of being correct as 'between' is a possibility due to negative connotation and 'existing' is removed by rule 2 in this question.\n7.

{"idx": 868, "text": "1) The question asks about a house that has little water in the air, which would make it feel dry. \n2) The first step is to identify the root cause of this - the main problem is that not enough water is present in the air. \n3) One can correct this using a humidifier (option A), which is a tool that creates and adds humidity in the air. 4) However, a humidifier wouldn't work well if one's house has an insufficient surface of earth, which could lead to unstable humidity levels (option C). \n5) Therefore, the best option would be to address the larger problem by turning on the sprinkler/lake nearby (option D, since lakes and rivers are connected underground water). \n6) This will ensure an increase in humidity of both the skating rink and the surface of the earth. \n7) Burning down the house to the ground is not an effective solution as it completely destroys the house. \n8) Burning down the skating rink, though, will result in the lakes of the area to lose water. \n9) So burning down one's skating rink is the only remaining option.\nSo the final solution is option 7 with C,D", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

While a horse could eat grass to obtain energy, the term 'dominated' is a metaphor for horses being physically tough or able to handle a difficult situation. \n4. While a horse could drink coffee, the word 'playing' could refer to the popular game of show-jumping. \n5. Thus, 'kept in stables' is the only answer that is a realistic description of what horses would do to get energy. \n6. Additionally, keeping horses in stables means keeping them in a building where horses are kept. \n7. A horse's usual habitat is not in a building. This means that horses are not normally kept in stables. They live on grasslands or the wild(returning to the key words 'get energy). \n8. Furthermore, stables are generally associated with horses, while grasslands aren't. \n9. Hence, to get maximum energy, a horse keeps itself in its natural habitat, the grasslands. \n10. As such, horses do not 'drink coffee' to get energy, do not play show-jumping, and do not eat grass to get energy. 11. 'eat grass' is not an activity, and not an energy-producing exercise.12.

'Beauty School', as you may have guessed is a location of a school and is incorrect.\n13. 'Hair Gallery' is a location to sell hair-related products and can be eliminated. \n14.

{"idx": 948, "text": "1: The question is asking what we use to hold together loose documents. \n2: The term 'loose papers' refers to any document or object lying without an enclosure or container. \n3: 'Binding' refers to the process of putting together or keeping documents together to form a book or document. 4: To bound is to keep documents together. 5: Bound documents can be held together with a binding spine. 6: Binding spines are the most common way to hold books and documents together.(Binder spine is a plastic film strip with a plastic ring at each end that serves as a spine for documents and hardback books. It holds the document's pages together and also enables the book to be kept open without the need to be tied or attached to anything. ) 7: The choice 'faithful' is not related to the question. It means truthful. 8: The choices 'packaged', 'loyal', and 'compact' may appear to be close to each other, so we must evaluate them separately. As 'packaged' refers to any item wrapped for transport or storage, this option does not apply to documents held together with a spine. \n\n9. Loyal or faithful refers to strong unwavering support or allegiance and doesn't suggest keeping documents together without a spine. 10. A 'compact' may also suggest a spinal form, but a compact also refers to something of small size. 11. Since 'compact' relates to small size, it does not suggest something like a binder spine. \n12. Hence, with the given details, the question is asking us to find a solution to a binding problem, so the answer must be the binding spine. \nSo the final answer of the question is B: bound\n\nInput: If it is a flat object, what do you usually do with it? Choices:  a: turn it over b: move to the next option c: give to a friend d: look for a paper clip\nOutput: 1a: the question asks us to find a solution for a problem regarding a flat object. 2. The statement, 'it is a flat object' implies that we are holding onto something flat and looking for a solution. 3. The first option 'turn it over' suggests that the object is a sheet or plate,", "answer": "C: bound"}
{"idx": 952, "text": "1: The first option is 'obtaining information'. This is not a natural process, rather, it stands as an incomplete sentence or verb.\n2: The second option, 'exchange of ideas', is a correct and natural language sentence, describing a natural process that happens in a brainstorming session\n3: The third option,'sharing information', is also a correct and natural language word choice. This can mean sharing your own ideas or sharing what others have said. \n4: The fourth option, 'conversation', could potentially be correct, but it excludes the act of gathering information. It essentially just says that a lot of talking took place. \n5: The last option, 'gathering information', is the only option that mentions the act of gathering - or obtaining - information. \n6: After evaluating all the choices, we can conclude that option 2 is the correct answer since it is the most appropriate and natural choice. \nSo the final answer for this problem is C: sharing information\n\nInput:What is something you have done more than once in a year? Choices: 1. Dry your own clothes 2. Buy a new computer 3. Take a shower 4. Buy lunch 5. Eat dinner with family\nOutput: 6. It is important to note that the prompt refers to something that one has done in a particular year, hence indicating a specific event. \n7. All four options (1, 2, 3, 4) can occur during the same year, since they are all natural occurrences that people do in a year. \n8. However, only option 5 stands as a unique event that would occur in a year, indicating that one 'eats dinner with family' multiple times per year. \n9.

{"idx": 956, "text": "1.\"Where can you see a Mammoth in NYC?\" suggests that you can find a Mammoth in a place that is not just the past. Thus, the question is not about prehistoric times.\n2. \"in museum exhibit\" is a grammatically correct sentence. If you can see it as a museum exhibit, its means  you aren't looking for a Mammoth in the city of NY. It means a Mammoth is in a place that is a museum at some point in time. If it is a mammoth in the past, its has got to be a museum of natural history.\n3. A mammoth in NY is not in the forest. Thus, this is not a suitable option either.\n4.\"Prehistoric Times\" refers to a time before the past. If you are trying to find a place to see a mammoth, you can eliminate it because you can only see it in the past.\n5.\"Mammoth\" is a type of animal. If you are going to see a mammal, you have to go to the Mammalian exhibit.\n6. The remaining option, \"E: Forest\", is the correct answer, because it is where you can actually experience a Mammoth.\nSo the final Answer is E: Forest\n\nInput:What is a place where the population is over 15,000? Choices: A: New York B: Chicago C: Toronto D: Miami E: Vancouver\nOutput: First, we check whether the answer is a city or a state.\n1.

According to the 2010 census, Miami has a population of 417,000, and Vancouver's population is 603,502.\n2. It is clear that only Toronto and Miami have population below 15,0\n3. Therefore, Toronto is the correct answer because it is a place where a population is below 15,500. Toronto has population: 2,615,060, and the question asks for a place, not a city.\nSo the final choice is C: Toronto\n\nInput: Where can you find the Grand Central Terminal?

E: Shake Hands & F: by wearing rings), as the only thing that needs to be said in order to be an agreement is just saying \"yes\".\n5) Hence the correct option is F: By Wearing Rings. \nSo the final answer to the question is F: By Wereing Rings\n\nInput:What about eating out?Choices:  A: restaurant B: cafeteria C: picnic D: school E: library\nOutput: \n1. A: The first choice, A: restaurant, is not about eating out. It is a place where you can eat and drink.\n2. B: cafeterias are places that serve meals. So while they are used to eat out, they are not a place where you can just go and eat.\n3. C: A picnic is an informal meal eaten outdoors. But, picnics are usually planned events.

Choices: 1. C: on the train 2. A: at a bookstore 3. B: at a park 4. C: in an Einstein museum\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about 'travel'. So option A: at a book store doesn't make sense because traveling to a book store is not considered traveling.\n2: The next option, B: at a park, could initially seem plausible but it's important that we consider the option as a whole. While we are travelling, we are most likely reading a biography of a famous person. \n3: A famous person is unlikely to be located in a park. As such, the next viable option is C: in an Einsteing museum.

Further, neither \"sailing boats\" nor \"binge drinking\" involve questioning authority. Therefore, in this case, the correct answer should be \"sailing in a boat\" for the following reasons:\n6) The activity is taking place in a liquid, which suggests the person is on the water.\n7) Sailing in a boat has a past tense form \u2013 \"sailing in\". Therefore, it is an activity or a hobby.\n8) The term \"sail\" refers to the large surface used to move through the liquid. If this was not taken into consideration, \"sailing\" would become a different verb (such as \"sailing towards the coast\").\n9) The last option, A: sail boats, is an active phrase implying that it is the subject of the sentence and so matches best with \"people engaged in\".\nSo the final answer should be B: sail boats\n\n# https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3068", "answer": "A: sail boats"}

The options have all similarities, and so, the correct answer is 3) C. They have Spanish as an official  language because both countries have Spanish as an official country language. Option A, B, and D are incorrect.  3.) Option C: \"They have Spanish as an official LANGUAGE\" because they are Latin American countries, Spain is part of Latin America, the former colonies of this area are all Spanish.

A church may be a place to purchase wine, but this does not qualify since it would be sacramental wine which would be distributed in bulk. \n5. A basement does not specifically pertain to the location where one can buy wine, and a typical basement will not be able to provide individual glasses. \n6.

While this is not explicitly stated, it is implied that the activity of playing soccer will lead to 'getting tired'. 3. The options A: excitement, B: fatigue, C: anger and E: getting tired are not suitable as none of these result from a long term engagement in soccer. 4. The correct answer thus is D: hurting. Hurt is a synonym for 'getting tired'. While a person may indeed become excited, fatigued or even angry while playing soccer, these emotions are indicative of a shorter engagement. The fact that they are part of a longer sequence indicates that a long term engagement would be accompanied by a resultant hurting as indicated by option D.\nSo the final answe is D: hurting \n\nInput: Where does this place start? Choices: 1. A: the center 2. B: the east 3. C: at the edge 4. D: here 5. E: here \nOutput: 1 - The given center of the place is indeed at the edge of where the place begins. 2. The given term 'edge' implies a place that is at the border of a bigger place. Hence, the correct answer is 4: here. 3. The given 'at the edge' can be viewed as synonymous with 'here' thus making option 4, here, also a correct option. Since we have already eliminated option 2, B: the east and option 3, C: at the edge, we can discard these options. 4. Option E: here is not a suitable choice because it indicates a vague location while we need a place. Thus, the only suitable one is option 4: here.

Choices: A: outside B: in C: far D: somewhere else\nOutput: 1: The question asks about where Chloe lives which is far away from other parts of Chloe's city. 2: \"Outside\" refers to an outside place, which is not the same as a place far away from other parts within the same city. 3: The word \"inside\" does not seem to have a relationship with a city. 4: Hence, the answer must be in the city, but not in places far away from other parts. 5: \"Far\" refers to a distance. It can also refer to a place that is far from other parts within the city. 6: The answer has nothing to do with the \"other parts\" of the city. 7: Since, from the context, the city's other parts refer to the city itself, hence, the answer would be D: somewhere else. 8: \"Somewhere else\" does not refer to places within a city, so the answer must not be somewhere else within the same city as Chloe. 9: \"Some other place\" is a vague option and hence it cannot be the answer.

{"idx": 29, "text": "1.\"Joe suffered many consequences\" means that Joe underwent a number of adverse repercussions in his life. \n2. This suggests that something severe happened to him. \n3. A clue for the solution can be found at line 3 of the question :\"...a stranger to death\". This indicates that the person who died was a perfect stranger to Joe. \n4. If Joe stabbed a complete stranger to death, it is likely that there would be a lawsuit involved. (The murder of a complete stranger is punishable by the law and Joe, due to his actions, would very well be considered the culprit) \n5. Hence, due to Joe's actions of killing a complete stranger, there would be a law suit against him.\n6. Looking at the choices :   Only A&E contain suitable punishment \n7. 'Knife wounds' is not a punishment since it doesn't involve litigation, so we can eliminate A&E. \n8. Similarly, 'buy a gun' is not a punitive action, so we can eliminate E. \n9. 'bleeding' is also not a suitable choice since it pertains to Joe's health, not the consequences he suffered. This is further proven correct by looking at the fact that bleeding did not follow the punishment of killing a complete stranger. \n10. By eliminating C&F and looking at the clues, we get a better idea of what the options boil down to : E. Joe's parents' death.

Choices: A: london B: new jersey C: las vegas D: rio\nOutput: 1: The question asks about a city's zoo where a very famous man in an animal outfit is working as a babon. \n 2: Based on the question, it does not say whether this man is a real babon or just dressed as a babon, so we can eliminate C: las vegas since this guy is a human wearing animal clothes. \n 3: If in the zoo they have animal outfits, they would also have a babon. Hence they would not have a man in babon outfits who is a famous animal in the zoo(contradictory).

E: beans is a reference to the type of food commonly referred to as 'beans' and this is not a place, not even a food.\n3.) Options B: west and C: solar system do not seem to be relevant places where one can lay in sun. Options A: in the basmemnt and D: beach can both be considered as potential answers. However it's worth noting that not many people will refer to the basment as a suitable place to lay out in the sun, as it's mainly used to store things.\n4.) It's important to remember the meaning of 'great' in the question; it's being used to mean, suitable, appropriate, sufficient; this also includes 'good'. Hence, a place can be 'great' if it's suitable to meet the condition specified in the question.\n5.) Beach being the first choice out of A: in the basmenst or D: beach would not be considered great because it can get hot at the beach and because it's also used to swim, which could potentially be viewed as an additional condition.

If one has an eating disorder, but doesn't lose weight but still gains energy, health, loose skin and beauty, then the conclusion is either incorrect (if 'gaining benefits' and 'losing weight' are not concomitant), or it should include a disclaimer of \"within specified limits\" (if one isn't concerned about the weight gain's limits).\n4) Based on the above, the answer is A: increased energy, C: loose skin and B: healthier. To select one of the remaining statements that is not implied by the provided answers, 'loose skin' is eliminated because it is an explicit benefit but 'healthier' is not necessarily included.\nSo the final answers are;\n(1) A: increased energy (reasonable answer/benefit)\n(2) B: healthier (reasonable answer/implied benefit)\n(3) C: loose skin (implied benefit)\nSo, the final correct answer is A: increased Energy/ B: Healthier/ C: Loose Skin\n\nInput: What should be done about a leak?

Choices: A: cheap B: costly C: free D: affordable E: high-value\nOutput: 1: 'Price' is a key component in the word \"value\". Hence D: affordable is the correct option.\n2. Option A: cheap is a valid but non-precise answer, since many things can be \"very inexpensive\", but we know we were asked to pick the least expensive option. We can eliminate cheap, and only keep the options that are cheaper than the rest: the words 'affordable' and 'free'.\n3. Similarly, only option D: affordable has value as a word: a combination of both 'expensive' and 'cheaper'. For the sake of completeness, the phrase \"very inexpensive\" (like 'cheap') is still another option to describe something that is very close in price to free. But we can remove this option too.\n4. However, the phrase \"very affordable\" (like D: affordable) is not a combination of both 'price' and 'cheaper' which leaves D as the only appropriate response. So D would always indicate an item of a low cost, hence making B: costly and C: free less accurate options.\n5.

'Theatres' could potentially be a response to boredom as watching movies is something done in theatres, but again, it's not a likely answer as boredom isn't really associated with watching movies that typically.\n4.

'Work' does, in fact, have a common connotation with boredom (boredom often occurs at work) and could thus easily be interpreted as a negative response. \n6.

{"idx": 173, "text": "1.'add line to' in the question is an idiomatic phrase, meaning it refers to adding something, such as a line, to something else. \n2. A bus stop is defined as a site for waiting for buses.\n3. In the context of receiving mail, it is not a phrase used to describe the process of adding a line to a message.\n4. Similarly, a graph does not refer to adding a line to something else.\n5. The word 'line' in the question probably refers to a telephone line, cable line, or power line, since these are the types of lines that most people would typically draw on a diagram or map.\n6. A play in the context of 'adding a line to' is likely a line of dialogue that has been added to the script or written text of a stage or audio performance. This does not correlate with the phrase from the question.\n7. The phrase from the question does refer to adding a line of written text to something else, for example, adding a line below an existing text or diagram.\n8. The term 'grass' is a natural growth of plants above the soil rather than something that is written or drawn somewhere.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is E: play  for the reason that it most closely fits with the phrase 'add line to', which means that we want to add a line of written text with the play.\nSo the final ans is E: play\n\nInput: An aerospace engineer is responsible designing which of the following?

Choices: A: wheels B: handle C: blade D: ground E: direction\nOutput: 1) Plow is a farm tool that is a form of equipment 2) It includes a handle, a blade and wheel. It's an object, hence the question asks about what makes something an object. \n\n3) The key phrase ''a plow'', refers to object of the plow (e.g. handle, blade). \n\n4) The word ''a'', indicates something that makes an object an actual object, that is, the ''handle'' in the sentence ''A plow has a handle;''. ''a'' in combination with ''handle '' could either be used to refer to a handle is an object, or as an example of a handle. Hence, neither ''wheels'', ''ground'' nor ''direction'' make a plow a p\nSo the final answer to our question is the ''handle''.\n\nInput: What is a reason to attend a funeral?

Choices: 1. A: liar 2. B: optimist 3. C: critic 4. D: logician 5. E: doubting Thomas\nOutput: What a tricky question. \n1. We all know what a liar is. To qualify as a liar you must believe what you are saying. \n2. Similarly, if one cannot believe something, one has to be an optimist. (Remember, a pessimist is someone who believes the worst will happen). \n3. If a person is a critic, then they will find faults in everything and would probably not believe much. \n4. If he is a logician, he will only use logic to make sense of the statements. \n5. One can be a doubting Thomas, but only for something that is impossible to believe, like the existence of a zebra in the middle of the Sahara wilderness.\n6.

But the term is \"cast net\" and not \"rod\" as per the question. So there's a mismatch. This is a hint that we are not in a fishing context.\n4. Based on the context, we need to look for damage done to a vehicle.\n5. Even if one has thrown a cast net out of anger and has thrown it on the ground, the question does not mention that. \n6. Also, the wording is \"If you've thrown you've ____ done damage to\". So here \"YOU\" will be the agent. This means the damage can't be the fish.\n7. So the \"rod\" could be a fishing rod(or a similar fishing accessory). Still, the context is not fishing. Hence, we eliminate A: fishing camp.\n8. The same applies to B: hardware store.\n9.

A bar is not relevant since bars are primarily places to drink alcohol.\n4. A casino is similar to a bar since it is also a place to drink, however, this does not quite match the question either.\n5.

It is used to measure lengths rather than areas and so is not suitable here.\n\n2: A square is also a shape and so it also does not serve the purpose of calculating area.\n\n3: Formula is in the form of an equation to solve a problem. It does not calculate an area as such and hence, it is not relevant here.\n\n4: A tape measure is used to measure a length as such but its measures cannot be used to calculate the room's area. So this is also not relevant here.\n5: The calculator, on the other hand, is a machine used to solve problems pertaining to calculation of different types. It thus might be relevant here.\nHowever, it can be seen here that the", "answer": "E: family room"}

Choices:  a: camera B: cell phone C: fax machine D: computer E: typewriter\nOutput:\n1. The question asks whether one 'takes pictures after using the telephine'. \n2. The phrase 'after using' doesn't refer to taking a phone call, but rather referring to the fact that we would take a picture after using the telephone. \n3. The telephone is a device that transmits information. Hence, the device for taking pictures refers to a camera as the only possible option.\n4. As a result, options A: camera, B: cell phone, C: fax machine, D: computer, and E: typewriter are irrelevant to this question and hence have to be eliminated.\n5. Combining all this information, the correct answer is C: camera, it refers to the fact that we take pictures after using the camera.\nSo the final correct answer is C:camera\n\nInput: A place having to decide whether to take advantage of a free concert.

Choices: 1: A: bring it to the vet for vaccination 2: B: let it out of the store 3: C: feed it 4: D: put it in a pet crate 5: E: give it a bath \nOutput: 1:The first option refers only to the vet, not the dog owner, and the latter has nothing to do with grocery shopping, so it is not correct.\n2:The second option does not require leaving a dog out of the store and therefore, cannot be used.\n3:The third option refers to feeding a dog, which is not required in order to take care of dogs in grocery stores. \n4:The fourth option involves putting the dog in a crate, which may or not need to take place in the store.

{"idx": 369, "text": "1.The question says students are trying to do something. \n2. To answer this question, we should identify what kind of activity students are trying to do. \n3. Students can be doing multiple things at the same time. For example, while studying philosophy they might also be drinking coffee. Or while furthering their education they can also be asking philosophical questions. \n4. Hence, instead of focusing on an exact act, we should analyse the broader category of activities students engage in. \n5. The options given are \"study philosophy,\" \"become adult,\" \"ask questions\" and \"further education.\" All of these options indicate a type of activity, but they do not necessarily involve both studying and furthering education together. \n6. Hence, we can eliminate \"study philosophy,\" as this is not a two part activity and \"further education,\" as this is a subset of studying. \n7. The two remaining options, \"become adult\" and \"ask questions\" are both single-part activities. Hence, even though a student might be asking questions while in further education, they cannot both do these simultaneously, implying these are not the correct answers. \n8. Similarly, although a student might want to further their education while they are studying, they can only study while they are studying, implying the answer cannot be \"become an adult.\" \n9.

As a result, i.e cannot be used if the description of the Robin is not part of the context. 3. the word 'of' and 'if' in the question are used to compare something to something else. \n4. Hence, e.g: means 'for example' or 'for illustration', as described in the Cambridge Dictionary, and the first and second options are plausible. 5.

Choices:  I: house II: factory III: school IV: hospital V: shop\nOutput: 1:'Carver' is a noun describing someone who carves wood, stone, or another such material.\n2.The correct answer must be in some type of building as that's where one usually uses tools to carve.\n3. Since a hospital specializes in healthcare, and a shop is a place where one goes to find things to buy, neither option is suitable. \n4. A school is a place to acquire knowledge, not a place to carve. The same reasoning applies to a factory.\n5. A house can either be your home or someone else's, but as 'house' is a pronoun, the question's context can't be referring to someone's home.\n6. 'House' may also refer to a place where people play games or have parties, but a carver is not likely to work in such a space.\n7.

{"idx": 381, "text": "1.. The garage had light sensing and automatic doors. What kind of house might it have? \n2. The question asks about the type of house that might have these features(automatic doors and light sensors).\n3. The first option, modern house, refers to a new and modern house, but does not answer the question directly as it does not specify if the house would have features like automatic doors and light sensors.\n4. Building refers to a generic term for a structure that could include a house with automatic doors or light sensors, but again does not answer the question specifically. \n5. Townhouse sounds like a good option, but it means a separate house, not a single house. Hence, it would be wrong to assume that a townhouse has automatic doors or light sensing, as this implies that there are multiple houses within the same building which is incorrect. \n6. Neighbors is a noun implying that it needs to be a single house with automatic doors and light sensing, but also noting that it is a generic term not indicating that a specific house has these features.\n7. Downtown refers to an area. It is unlikely that there would be individual light sensors and automatic door sensors throughout an entire downtown, so this is also not the answer.\n8. Therefore, we can rule out these options. A possible answer is therefore C: townhouse, which is a single house with features like automatic doors and sensing.\nSo the final choice is C: townhouse.\n\nInput: When you ride bikes in an office park, where do you go?

Thus, the location could be in any of the five answer options(A-E). \n3: Since the bike could be ridden on the street within the office park boundary, one option might be A: street.\n\n4: However, one might reasonably also want the parking lots in an office building as this is where one would have a place to leave one's bike.

The only disadvantage is the lack of privacy and security at this location. 3 : People in dormitories or student-housing can put things in closets and drawers 4 : Closets are often built to hold clothes and other personal belongings, while drawers are common in kitchen cabinets 5 : Therefore, people use trashcans, rooms, or closets to store belongings\nSo the final answeris C:closets\n\nInput:How long did it take to deliver the dress?

The Empire State Building is not underground; therefore, the option \"underground\" is not a possible answer. Likewise, \"huge\" and \"tall\" are not possible answers since they refer to a building's height. Similarly, \"small\" and \"low\" would not be suitable answers as they refer to a building being small and low.\n3) Therefore, the only suitable options are \"high\" and \"huge\".

We can then combine information from one option together to eliminate them. For example, the answer for A may be 'wood' or 'paper'. We can eliminate the paper, since paper is a material that is made of cellulose and other plant fibers. Hence, from here onwards, A is wood. \n3) Cardboard is a material that is used for packaging and containers. It's mainly a paper-based material, so we can disregard it for now. \n\n4) The other choices may be a combination of what is already said, and eliminating ones that are not applicable. For this example we would need to eliminate the materials that are not applicable. Metal is a natural material; it's usually found in iron, copper, gold, silver, and alloys.

{"idx": 449, "text": "1: The question ask us to define what Love is. It's a tricky question as its wording is pretty vague. \n2: Love is an abstract word that's subjective and can't be defined with just one word or a list of words that fit the description. \n3: The options are A, B and C, all which are not good definitions of Love as they give a literal meaning to the abstract word. \n4: Thus Love does not have a finite meaning or a conclusion which makes it indefinable. \n5: Hence, Love cannot be defined as it's an undefined state of mind or feeling of something or someone.  \n6: Thus we could say \"Love is infinite in possibilities and depth\", but that's an abstract definition which doesn't really satisfy the requirements of the question. \n7: The last option \"Love is blind\", is also not a suitable answer as by definition Love does not have to be blind(to the contrary, some say Love is blind and others disagree with this point of view). \n8: After carefully examining all the possible options and the definition question, the correct answer is \"Love is Infinite\". The answer could also be \"Love is Infinte possibilities and depth\", as there is no problem with the wording if we take \"infinite\" in its literal sense(as the question is vague, there is no correct answer which could be wrong or right) \nSo the final answer could be any of these two: A) Love is Infinite or B) Love is Infinite possibilities and depth\n\nInput: Why are some people so nice on the job?

{"idx": 457, "text": "The first option, A: call 9,11 is incorrect because you don't call 911 for a party, but instead you call them only in case of emergency. Next, the second option, B: enjoy yourself, may seem appropriate because you do indeed enjoy yourself at a party, but you don't necessarily get drunk in the process. You can enjoy yourself without having to get drunk. The third option,C: get drunk, is definitely an option and would be the most likely answer for many people, however, it doesn't seem quite right within the context of the question. The party being discussed is a teenage party and getting drunk is not an appropriate activity for a teenager.\nThus the final answer is:\nD: have a good time.\n\nInput: what do people do when they know it\u2019s time to leave? Choices: 1. A: go to another place 2. B: eat something 3. C: talk to other people 4. D: meet with new people 5. E: listen to music\nOutput: The first option 'go to another place' is an appropriate option when you find yourself in a situation where you should leave. Talking, listening to music, eating and meeting new people are all different types of activities, however they would not necessarily be what one does when 'it is time to leave'.\nThe second option 'eat something' is a possible option. As you are about to leave, you could have a quick meal before you go. This would not mean that you have arrived at your next destination, only that you have eaten.\nThe third choice 'talk to other people' could potentially work. If one has arrived at a destination or is at a gathering, one might choose to befriend someone or listen to what they are saying.\nThe fourth choice'meet with new people' also works. You can meet with new people when you are at a destination or a gathering and decide to have some pleasant conversation with them.\nFinally, the last option 'listen to music' could also be an appropriate option. However, this choice could possibly be misconstrued. The meaning should be interpreted as 'listening to music', rather than playing a music CD or a radio CD, to show that one is about to leave.\nThus the correct answer as per the hints:", "answer": "C: get drunk"}

The first option, does not include shampoo, i.e. \"The delivery man was deliver(ing) a whole crate of perfume\". So we can exclude it.\n4. The second option, motel, is a place where people stay, so it's not the place that's meant by the question.\n5. The next option, hotel, is a place where you can get a place to stay (a room or two or more) where you can get other facilities like food and cleaning from the staff.\n6. Next up is the fourth option, hair salon. This option can be eliminated as well, because hair salons do not sell shampoo so buying shampoo there would not make sense.\n7. The last option, motel, also refers to a place where you can stay overnight, so it doesn't make sense for the question either.\n\n8. Combining all of the above, only one option left - hair saloon. This is a place where hair stylists cut and style hair, so hair salons would definitely use shampoo and would need a whole crate of it.\n9.

Since the term 'normally' is being used in conjunction with the term'say', it implies that a cat can say many different things, and isn't limited to one common trait. 2. Since the last five letters in the question ('say) and 'lives' )start from the same word 'live', it means that we should probably only consider answers that begin with 'live'. 3. When eliminating options, since cats cannot use a fork, and a cat cannot drink water and live many years at the same time, these options cannot be the answers. 4. When evaluating the potential answer candidates, cat cannot be king, since cats are not royalty, nor can cat say hello, since cats are typically known for meowing. This leaves options C. 5. Eliminating option B is easy because seeing king would be an abnormal trait. Option E can be eliminated since cats don't typically live as long as humans, but live years is a much smaller number, hence cats likely don't say 'live many years'. 6. Option A is incorrect because since cats usually only use a few words, it is very unlikely for cats to say hello. 7.

Speech that is not natural or understandable. \n\n5.) Combining all the information above, we can conclude that, out of the given options, option E is most likely to happen to someone who is intoxicated. \n\n6.) Option D is not possible because the question specifies that speech is most likely to become more incoherent after the person becomes more drunk.\n\n7.) Option A is not possible as the question gives a very strong indication that speech becomes more incoherent due to inebriation.\n\n8.) Option C is not possible either.

We are looking for the action that is performed first in opening a computer before you work on any of the other choices. 2.) This option C: click is suitable as clicking has to be the one performed first in computer use. 3.) In fact, we should be able to perform this function as soon as the computer is turned on after the first step (as per the question). 4.) As a result, C: click is the first option available. 5.) Hence, we can be certain that this is one of the options. 6.) However, other options available are still possible. So, we need to verify the other alternatives. 7.)

{"idx": 573, "text": "1: The question asks the location of a place where one would need to stand in a line and have a coat with them to guard against the cold weather.\n2: The clues provided in the question point to a location where one waits on a long line. This is one of those places.\n3: A good or 'good' book is something one would take with them when they are busy reading it. Therefore, the clue 'good book' points to a location that is more suitable for a reading place or the library, and thus, these two are ineligible.\n4: A bad 'book' isn't what one would want to take with them, so 'the book' should be referring to the bad book.\n5: The Bank at noon can be an option of being a place on the bank. However, one wouldn't need a coat to protect them from the cold while they're on the bank. Thus, this location is ruled out.\n6: 'Between Noon' can mean the afternoon or 'between'  Noons. Since the question suggests to stand in a line which may extend to the afternoon, the Bank could well be an option. Thus, eliminating this option.\n7: Since the Bank option is out, the only option left is the last one 'Post Office'.\nSo the final answer if the correct answer is E: Post Office.\n\nInput: How would you describe a place where people can buy vegetables, fruit, milk, and cheese?

It is crucial to look carefully at the question and the provided options to find the most probable answer.\n3. One important tip to remember is that park includes parks. We should therefore try out more options for park with fewer words.\n4. From here, we can narrow down our search to bus stop, corner, store front, and trash can.\n5. Even though all the options seem possible, we eliminate bus stop and corner because they do not include the entire city.\n6. Even though store front could be a possible location for trash can, it is easier to find trash cans in public areas than private areas as seen with bus stops and corner.\n7. Finally, remembering the keywords, park, and trash can, we can choose E: store front as our final answer as we can typically find trash cans there.\nSo the final correct answer is E: store front", "answer": "C: corner"}
{"idx": 581, "text": "1: The question about places where John would avoid. 2. John loves animals, he hates animal abuses, and he would be careful about the places he should never go. \n3. The phrase 'he would be careful about places' indicates that John is most likely trying to stay away from places likely to contain such animal abuses. This could mean that he wants to avoid places where such abuses are easily seen. \n4. The first place that comes to mind is probably a pet store. Most people don't usually go to the pet store to abuse their animals, but some do and there are probably enough pet stores for John to possibly find one that may have an animal abuser in it. The second option, parking lots, is also a potential place for animal abuse, as people may take their animals and walk them there. \n5. The third option, woodlands, is not a place where animal abuse would be done, as it's used for growing animals and such. It's important to remember the word'most'. 'Most', used in the question, means all the times an action is done, the most successful times will be considered. If we consider the times that animals are cared for in a woodland, while it would be the most common time animal care would be done, that's not what the question was concerned with. \n6. The fourth option is North America, but this too, does not seem to be a place where animals would be abused. North America is a whole continent, with many different locations across many varying countries - and while animal abuse may occur in some of these locations, it doesn't mean that it would happen in every town and city where it can be found. We can thus safely eliminate this option from consideration. \n7. After carefully evaluating all the other options, the most suitable answer would most likely be option E: the park, as it's an area well known for animal lovers, and thus, the least likely place where animal abuse might occur. \nSo the final answer  is E: the park\n\nInput: What are shelf, closet, drawer, bookcase and desk?

Moving cars (like driving vehicles) on the road entails driving a transportation vehicle such as a car and other modes of transport such as a bus or a train on a specific route through the road to move the vehicle from one location to another.\n3. Moving cars can include, getting tired (from driving a long distance to the next location) or even accidents (which can happen while driving) but these aspects are not entailed or essential in the question.\n4. The question seems to refer to a route or route taken by vehicles in which case, we can eliminate options C, D and E as none of them pertain to travel.\n5. The third option (A: drive), is incorrect because the question seems to be asking about the route of car movement rather than whether the car is moving or not.\n6. Option (B: road), means the path of movement to a destination so could entail car movement. Although a road may also be in reference to the path on which cars can move, it is not essential.\n7.

By \"pay money/lose money/or save money\", the meaning here is that when women buy a product in a store, they end up either saving money or losing it (based on their initial budget/cost of the product).\n3. Since the question only asks for a verb that is used to make a woman feel they have saved or lost money, other options (D: go shopping and E: pay money) cannot be eliminated.\n4.

We know that a word can be pronounced fast or slow in more than one way, i.e. in different ways. \n3. \"fruit and rule\" are words that are pronounced fast or slow.\n4. Since both are pronounced fast or slowly, there is nothing out of the ordinary.\n5. \"pig and gig\" have different ways of being pronounced when fast/slow. \n6.

{"idx": 685, "text": "1. What we first want to do in a coding interview is understand what the question is asking us to identify. In this particular case, the question is asking about the result of institutting, or taking, civil action.\n2. Taking action is synonymous to doing something. In the context of this question, it means taking it to court.\n3. This is a fairly straightforward question that can be answered quickly with the knowledge of the specific terms being used.\n4. After understanding the question, the options seem fairly standard. The term \"bad feelings\" seems out of place as feeling bad would not be the result of institutoting civil action. In this case, we can eliminate this option as there is no indication that bad feelings would result.\n5. The term \"hurt feelings\" might be a possibility, but once again, it would not be caused by instituting civil action. Furthermore, it makes no mention of taking it to court. Thus we can also eliminate this option.\n6. When we think of going to court, it's more common to describe it as a \"going to court ACTION\" and not \"going to court feelings\". Therefore, we can also eliminate this term.\n7. Coming back to our original choice, we can now quickly narrow down the options and get to the correct one. \n8. Civil action is usually meant to involve taking it to court, so B: confusion does not make any sense as the answer.\n9.

For instance, some people may feel sleepy when they go to the opera for a good reason! \n3) Additionally, the 'you' refers to only one person as the description makes it clear that they are there for a specific reason (to attend the show), not other people in general.\n4) Therefore, the correct answer is C: boredom since a single person may not get sleepy for attending it but would more likely be bored.\nSo the final answe is C: boredness\n\nInput:How can a person find a hotel room? Choices:  Sleep early  A: Look in a guidebook B: Ask a salesperson C: Go online D: Follow the signs E: Look for a directory\nOutput: 1.) The question gives clues about the location or activity with 'a hotel room'. This can be used as an indication that the person may not be physically going to the 'hotel' to find a room, but rather on the web or even with a book/guidebook/app. This is because they are only asked how they can 'find' a hotel room, not stay in one. \n2.) Hence, the correct answer needs to demonstrate how they can virtually 'find' a hotel online. \n3.) A clue about the room type to look for, such as a'single' or 'double' room could indicate that the person may need to make a reservation before arrival. \n4.) The word 'look' in the question can refer to physically searching for a guide or online room booking site (guide book website). A guide may give more information about the booking process and sites that need to be used. \n5.) After evaluating all these clues, it's clear that the person should first look for 'online' hotel room bookings.

This implies that the desk is frequently used. It is possible to have a desk in a private home or workplace, but this choice also implies that it is used frequently and by professionals.\n\n3.  The following choices do not fit the description and should be eliminated:\n   3.1. Bedroom. A bedroom would not have a desk of the type described in the question.\n   3.2. Library.

{"idx": 701, "text": "1. The question asks what an obvious place might be for celebrating. \n2. We are given that people celebrate by going to places. This means that any physical space they go to to celebrate is an obvious answer. \n3. In other words, any place where people go can be considered possible; it's the place itself that would determine whether it's obvious. \n4. Looking at the available choices, we see that the only place where people might go are A: state park, B: opera, E: park, and D: carnival where people could ride rides. \n5. Although the term 'carnival' refers to a festive gathering, it is not an obvious place to go as it cannot be taken literally.\n6. Out of the other choices, the only one that makes sense is B: opera. While not many people would go to the opera to celebrate, people can still go there for celebratory purposes. \n7. Moreover, it can be argued that the opera is an obvious place to go to celebrate as it's a famous theater, hence well-known and not likely to be forgotten. \n8. With this in mind, the correct answer is that the obvious place to go is B: opera.\nSo the final answe is B: operaa\n\n\nInput:  What's an obvious place to go, but not a place where people go? Choices:   A: opera B: park C: state park D: library E: movie theater F: church\nOutput:\n1. The question asks is what an obvious place people can go, but are not frequently found in.\n2. An obvious place that people can go is a place that has been advertised or is well-known among people. Therefore, it must be easy to recognize from past exposure.\n3. In contrast, less obvious places are unfamiliar to people and may be confused with other places.\n4.

We can immediately eliminate B: Pleasure for being less realistic than the other two options, as well as due to the previous answer's hint that it doesn't apply to everyone. This leaves us with C: Get divorced, which seems to answer the question, given the term 'lawyers and their.' \n3: Returning to the question, we see that the term 'what' can only refer to a plural object, so the correct answer must also be plural.

It is evident that an act of suicide leads to sorrow, but sorrow is not an outcome. Scars is an outcome, as it is the result of an action. This leaves us with three options.\n3. Out of these, misery and kill yourself do not fit the question as they describe the outcome and the result of the action is inevitable.\n4. Thus, sorrow and scars are the best available options and out of these sorrow is a more probable outcome than scars.\n5. It is not plausible that simply being born might lead to scars. This eliminates option B.\n6. Similarly, it is also possible for success to lead to sorrow. This eliminates option D.\n7. As a result, option C is the correct response.

Choices: 1. police station 2. house 3. farm 4. park 5. airport\n\nOutput: Riding a horse is used in the context of riding horses during a police operation. It does not mean that the rider is simply walking on the horse, which would be inaccurate. In fact, the context implies that the rider is on a duty, which would be on a horse.\n\n6. The question asks where one could be as a police officer when riding a horse, which narrows down our possibilities.\n7. From this, we know that the only possible locations are the park, house, park and airport.\n8. The word 'house' refers to one's residence and is not a location, which eliminates this as an option.\n9. 'Park' can be a location as well as an activity. In this case, it is an activity; hence it is to be considered irrelevant. So Park is eliminated as well.\n10. 'Airport' is too a specific word referring to an airfield. It can not be interpreted as a location.\n11. Similarly, 'Park' is again eliminated by the same argument.\n12. With this out, 'H", "answer": "E: kill yourself"}

Common purposes generally include religious and cultural services, recreation, and shopping. However, these activities are not done in schools. Additionally, when referring to a school in a community, it typically refers to the school as a structure within the community, not the community as a whole.

However, it is not necessary to choose a location in a town or city, and the options are not necessarily limited to specific countries.

{"idx": 741, "text": "1.) This question appears to be asking about an activity that someone does at the moment of hearing a joke, and then possibly during their conversation with friends. \n2.) If someone is chuckling at the moment of hearing the joke and they continue to do so at the moment of their conversation with friends, that's obviously one way for someone to respond.  It's however important to note that this is not the only way. \n3.) Therefore, based on this, the answer choices should also include those that describe other possible ways for someone to respond.\n4.) This also indicates that the question is not about where a person hears or tells a joke (and therefore all choices that describe locations do not apply). It's also about one single event that describes what one does immediately upon hearing a joke (returning to the question, and to the clue 'hear').  \n5.) The first alternative, A: giggle, is clearly not describing what a person does immediately upon hearing a jokes.  Even if someone has a good sense of humor, he/she does not instantly start giggling as soon as he/she hears a joke.  Even if he/she starts giggling as a reaction to the joke in the next moment(s), it's not about what one does when he/she first hears the joke.  Consequently, A: giggle cannot be the answer. \n6.) B: lie is also not describing what a person would do immediately upon hearing a joe.  In most cases, it's obvious that he/she does not lie as soon he/she hears the joke(returning to the \"question\", the word \"hear\" was deliberately chosen because clearly, one can't tell a joke unless he/she first tells the joke to be read or heard, hence the use of the word \"hear\").  Even if he/ she lies in the next moment, this is also unrelated to what one is supposed to do/react to immediately after one first hears a joke, so also, this cannot be the answer.\n7.) C : laughing is not an appropriate response for hearing jokes either.  He/she will likely laugh at some point after having heard the joke, but not at the moment one has just heard the joke.  Therefore, C laughing cannot be the answer", "answer": "C: laughing"}

To 'cash in' means to 'profit from' or'make money from', and this implies a commercial transaction. We can narrow down the possibilities more precisely by recalling that the artist knew that this was not just any fan, but a fandom, implying a group of many people. \n3. Choice A: Selling out refers to selling out to the public, which is inappropriate in this context as the artist is supposed to be reassuring the fans that they are not selling out.\n4. Choice B: Happy refers to positive emotions, a different meaning than the question is looking for.\n5. Choice C: Fishing means to wait for (i.e. 'to hang on to') something (i.e. fame), and is not a plausible action for an artist in this context.\n6. Choice D: Receiving payments refers to receiving money from somewhere, which could be used to 'cash in', but is different than getting paid, which means getting paid for selling something. \n7. Choice E: getting paid refers to getting paid for some sort of work, which is not what the artist would do after selling out.\n8. After accounting for all this, the only possible answer is D: receiving money, as the artist would get paid (i.e. get money) for the fame (i.e. money) that they sold, in the process of selling out (i.e. making money).\nSo the final answer could be D: receiving money\n\nInput: Too much fuzz will be seen for this season, is this to be long a style?

However, because the question does not specify any of these details, it is unhelpful to use this information in determining the answer.\n5.) D: burning yourself would not be a result of causing damage to anyone else's property. This is an event that occurs after damage has been done. Therefore, the answer should be eliminated.\n6.)

There is not anything that tells us exactly where the light comes from and with candles not always being lit, this is still plausible.

However, the term theatres is commonly understood to mean a place that shows movies, which is a different context entirely. Hence, the first choice should be eliminated.\n3 The second option can, at first, seem to be a likely choice. A health department is indeed a place where one can get medical checkup, and it is in these establishments that pamphlets regarding diseased and ails can be found. However, the question is not asking about a medical checkup. It is only asking about pamphlets, whose existence is independent of a checkup. Thus, we eliminate choice C.\n4 The third option can also be eliminated on the basis that the term drawer refers to a compartment that can potentially contain things. However, choice D also provides us with a possibility that the pamphlets are being kept in a drawer. There is no guarantee that the pamphlets would necessarily keep themselves together in a drawer, nor is there any guarantee that a drawer would even exist. This possibility makes choice D unreliable.\n5 The fourth option is the only remaining choice. It is likely that pamphlets would be placed in a library.

There are several types of columns in buildings, like pillars, walls, and floors. For example, the Colosseum in Rome is famous for its vast array of columns. Additionally, an architectural style called \"column-and-lintel\" is characterized by its columns supporting a large overhang at the top. Roman architecture is a popular style of building with columns, which has stood the test of time, making it an option of the correct answer.\n4.) The White House refers specifically to the United States' most famous building, the Washington D.C.-based government office.\n5.) A spreadsheet is a table consisting of rows and columns containing data, which can be used to calculate arithmetic and mathematical functions. However, the question is asking about making columns of numbers and not making a spreadsheet. Hence, this excludes this choice from possible answers. The same goes for bridge, as bridges can consist of columns to support them, but not necessarily as a type of mathematical function or calculation.\n6.) The Pantheon, a Roman monument constructed over 1,900 years ago, is a remarkable edifice that features columns. However, the mention of columns is vague and could also refer to any other columns in other Roman buildings. Also, the question asks not for columns but numbers, and the pantheon is a place, not a piece of mathematics.\n7.) Therefore, the choice that satisfies all the criteria is B: Roman architecture as it contains columns which make sense in the question.\nSo the final decision is B: Roman architecture\n\nInput: What do you call a room where you use a computer?

The investigator sent the gun evidence to the police station, which is why the correct answer is D: crime scene.\n2. A drawer, back to the owner, and crime scene are all possible locations where a gun could be sent.\n3. However, the sentence specifically mentions \"where\" the investigator sent the gun, implying that he sent it (or is sending it) to a specific physical location, and not to a drawer, back to its owner, or crime scene. Thus, the other locations can be eliminated as possible answers.\n4. The police station and crime scene are the only remaining options, and it becomes clear that the investigator sent the evidence to the police station when he referred to the crime scene as \"where\" he sent it. Thus, the correct choice is D: crime scene, which is the place where the evidence was taken/sent to.\n5. A holster is not a possible choice because it's a place where a gun is stored rather than sent.\n6. A back is not a possible choice, as it's a section at the back of something rather than a place where a gun could be.\n7. Finally, a drawer is also not a possible choice, since it's a location that stores items, not necessarily where they are sent.\nSo the final answers is D: Crime scene\n\nInput: Where do the iguanas typically remain after molting?

It's unclear if zoos would permit fish to live in the same environment as iguanas, but the presence of fish at the aquarium makes that the likely answer choice. \n4. Additionally, it's unlikely that the iguanas are transported from the forest to the aquarium, so the aquarium is the most likely answer choice, as seen in the third sentence.", "answer": "C: police station"}

The second option, i.e. rooms with square shape, similarly is an option to eliminate because rooms with square shape can have doors and windows.\n5. The third option, i.e, rooms with flowers, is also an option to eliminate since flowers can be seen in rooms but not the rooms mentioned.\n6. Combination of all the above 4 steps, i.e. doors and windows is an option to eliminate since all rooms face the outside (outdoors).

The minimum age to become an adult is 18 years (considering the question to be asking at what age one is too big for a couch), while the maximum age to become an adult in law is 20 years. If an adult can\u2019t still fit in a child seat/couch then one must be over 18 years old or over 20 years of age. \n3- 18 years old and above. In this case, a crib is intended to be a child\u2019s sleeping area in his/her youngest years, rather than any seat which might have other functions.

This choice describes the act of people who are models, specifically in terms of their purpose. When compared to the fourth option, this choice seems more reasonable than the latter as it directly answers the question and is more focused on this particular action.\n6) Finally, the fourth option, D, 'pay bills' is unrelated to the question.

{"idx": 905, "text": "1) The question asks about a connection that could have caused James to be delayed. \n2) A connection refers to a link or pathway and may involve physical or digital networks.\n3) Combining this information with 'couple' of hours, we know that the connection in question might be physical. \n4) If it were digital, James could have possibly finished his work on time. \n5) Since an airport connection is most likely a physical one, then it could cause a delay. However, 'couple hours' is unlikely to involve that long a delay. \n6) In a computer network, a delay cannot cause this level of delay. \n7) The last option, love, is impossible as the question doesn't reference any love that may cause a delay.\n8) Thus, the correct answer to the question is C: airport as it's the only option that fits the scenario described.\nSo the final answers is C: airport", "answer": "B: airport"}

Choices:  Happier poor A: Poor but happy B: Rich as a king C: Dirt poor D: Filthy rich E: Rolling in money\nOutput:The question is asking us what better phrase can describe 'having no or almost no money'. \n1. The phrase 'poor yet happy' means being happy even when one has little financial or material wealth. However, this is not the phrase in question.\n2. The phrase 'rich as a king' is a clich\u00e9 that means having a large sum of money. \n3. The phrase 'dirt poor' often refers to suffering from poverty, but it can also mean being frugal or living an impoverished lifestyle. \n4. The phrase 'filthy rich' refers to someone being very wealthy. However, this phrase is used in a negative sense, and therefore it is not suitable for the question, as it is asking for a positive phrase.\n5. The phrase 'rolling in money' is a literary term that means being filthy rich. It can be used either in a positive or a negative sense. But in this context, it means wealthy.\n6. Hence, the answer is B: Rich as a King as the phrase suggests the opposite. \nSo the final result turns out to be A:", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}

A. horse B. donkey and E. donkey are the correct choice, as rabbit and horse are animals, while rat and rabbit are animals.\n3) We need to find an animal that can run that can be found in the question.\n4) B. rat and C. fox can not run, since they are mammals, and they can not be used, as they are animals of different categories\n5) The third step is to find any animal that is considered a mammal that can be used.

Option D: indian ocean is not the answer since the indian ocean is on the south-east side of India, and it is not where one would expect to find sharks. \n5. Option E: gulf of Mexico is not the answer since it is a bay located near the country of Honduras, and therefore not a place where one would expect to see sharks. \n6.

Choices: A: police B: coach C: general D: runner E: captain\nOutput: 1- The question is asking who is responsible, or in charge of the 'baton relay'. This means looking for a person who is in charge of the relay. \n2. Option A: police is not the correct answer since they are responsible for traffic and law enforcement. \n3. An option D: runner is not the correct answer either since runners just run on their own and are not in command of anyone. \n4- The other remaining options are B: coach,C: general and E: captain. \n5. However, we can eliminate C: general, as a general is only the leader of an army and does not have control over their actions in a relay. \n6. We can also eliminate E: captain due to a captain only being the leader of a vessel and not having control over the actions within the relay. \n7. Hence, the right answer to the question is still between C: coach and B: captain. \n8. A baton is a military weapon and a'relay' may refer to an army.

'fear' is not an option either as it relates to fearing the consequences of one's action, not a motivation to confess it in the first place.\n4.'go free' relates with being free from trouble and not a reason to confess.\n5. 'problems' is only a possibility if the person does not feel confident about being caught, however, this is not the main reason here.\n6.

{"idx": 937, "text": "1.\\ The term \"crowd(s)\" is a collective noun which refers to a group of people.\n2. In order to answer the question, one must consider the relationship between a \"crowd\" and the concept of \"big\".\n3. A \"crowd\" is not the same as just \"big\". A \"crowd\", or a group of people, cannot in and of itself be \"big\" or \"small\" as that depends on other factors such as the number of people.\n4. Hence, it is not possible for a \"crowd (a group of people)\" to be \"big\" or to be \"small\".\n5. \"Alone\", \"small group\", and \"solitude\" are all individual-based concepts, which focuses on the number of people which are present.\n6. In this case, the crowd which was not as big as the crowd in the previous question can be described as \"small group\", as compared to the number of people in the previous question.\n7. Finally, based on the clues in the previous question and the definitions of the terms, the answer is \"small group\".\nSo the final answer in is E: small group because the crowd is definitely not \"alone\", it is definitely a crowded group.

Learning is not a verb if the phrase uses it like this: How to be learned? So here learning is a verb.

Choices:  A) impressed B) flabbergasted C) dismayed D) humbled E) struck\nOutput: The word 'dumb' means stupid so we can eliminate B, C and D. Since B doesn't match to the clue, C doesn't make much sense, and D isn't a verb which means that this word describes what happens \n when you are ___. Hence, the phrase is 'when you are struck'. A, E, F cannot be correct since these phrases are in the dictionary. This leaves us with A, E, and F.\nBased on prior knowledge about the phrase 'dumb-struck' which means stunned or surprised by someone or something, the best interpretation is of the answer E, which correctly describes a 'dumbstruck person'.\n So the final answer will be: E When you are striking.\n\nInput: You will have to wait awhile in a line for a bus. Choices:  A ) an aisle (B) a line (C) a rack (D) a wait (E) a lane\nOutput: The phrase 'a while' is a long period of time and a bus stop is often where you will find a long line of people waiting for a bus. And in some countries they queue in lines. We only need to look beyond the literal meaning of the phrase. If we interpret 'a while' as 'a long period of time', bus stops will not apply, since they are always temporary for about 5/10 minutes.

The question asks where stairs are located next to a settees, so we rule out that stairs may not be located in a kitchen, bathroom, or front door.\n3.) One can not just walk into a house and look through rooms, only the living-room. We also don't take into consideration the fact that a settee could be located in multiple rooms of a house.\n4.) A staircase is most likely located in a hallway, which may be linked to as many or more places such as the living-room(which may be called as a drawing-room), bathroom, kitchen, bed room etc. as it may include a hallway. \n5.) Bedrooms will likely include only bed or a settee. \n6.) Bedrooms are often small and in need of having to walk into another room to use the living-room(or drawing-room), bath room and kitchen.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the stairs are linked to all five different places, but the settee is found in the bed room.\nSince options D, H, I, B and C, are all wrong, the final answer is E.\n\nInput:Who could take", "answer": "C: office"}

Hence, the location must be a place that is not wet and could be a place in the kitchen for storing dry food items. \n3. As such, the closest choice(eaten, pizza) can be eliminated as olive will not be eaten. This is because oil is a non-edible ingredient(unless mixed with other liquid and turned into an edible cocktail), which is not needed in a pizza or food dish.\n4. After using common sense, choices D: pizza E; refrigerator, and C: jar are not plausible as well. \n5. This leaves us with choices A: eaten or B: glasses. \n6. B: glasses makes less sense than A: eaten as even though glasses can be considered a dry food item, its wetness comes from the water content of its make(glasses are mostly filled with water). As a result, the correct answer hence is B: eaten.\nSo the final question is B: eaten", "answer": "C: jar"}

The police at the airport can assist at the security check, hence C: security check is eliminated. 3.) Also, an airport in this modern era generally does not permit a private car to enter, hence we eliminate option D: parking garage. \n4.) We are left with the taxi stand at airport, option B: taxi stand can help you but the probability of getting lost at an airport is very low, so this is also discarded.

After all, being forgiving is a sacrifice, not something to be celebrated and rejoiced over. We have to remember that it costs us something, so being forgiving should not result in \"newfound freedom.\"\n5. That leaves the final option, E: goodheart. Although we cannot say this is the only option, this name for the hidden force does seem to best describe what occurs when we forgive.

The option that stands out the most when assessing all the options as a whole is, C: sober(one is drinking, therefore is not sober). The reason being that is does not make sense to get drunk if you only have a single beer, but, if you want intoxication then you might want to buy more than a single beer, where B: problems, D: intoxications, & E: pleasure, do not make sense as an answer here. Hence, the answer, when combined with the question would be 'C: sober', which makes the most sense. So the final answer is C: sober", "answer": "E: pleasure"}
{"idx": 985, "text": "1st: The wording of this question is important as it is worded 'Danny hated helping' (past tense) indicating that Danny is not currently doing something (so A & B is eliminated).\n2nd: We can further eliminate B, since helping brings \"good feelings\" so C is obviously not the answer either.\n3rd: 2. Since the question is worded '...bring...' and not \"brings\". The question cannot be answered with just another 'brings'. For example \"satisfaction\" (which is a noun) or \"feelings\" (which is a plural) which is the answer here.\n\nSo the final answer here is E: feel good about yourself but to make it correct you must be sure that Danny hates helping people when this was the previous thing he did and he is currently not helping someone for that reason.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question by selecting the correct response below.\n\nInput: A book is in which?

{"idx": 993, "text": "1- The question asks about a 'thing' that was supposed to be examined, and what the'she' considered about it.\n2- The thing could be any object, and 'to learn about' is a verb that could relate to a thing.\n3- The word 'complex' is unspecific, and is in the same category as 'eat cake,' 'buy,' 'interests,' and 'learn': all irrelevant words.\n4- \"To examine\" means just \"to look\" in the dictionary. So the option which makes sense is that she 'looks' at the thing, hence 'B: buy' is incorrect here.\n5- After eliminating the irrelevant options (eat cake, buy, interests, complex, and learn about), the only option left is D: complex.\nSo, the final answer is D-complex\n\nInput:He told her to put what on to make something for their tea party?

{"idx": 997, "text": "1) The human is someone you share your life with, so if you wish to be around each other you would go to someone's house or place of work.\n2) A: place of work may be a place where this person already is.\n3) C: friend's place of residence is more often referred to as a friend's home rather than house.\n4) E: deep thought is a verb phrase and does not refer to a location. \n5) B: office is not a home nor a place of residence but a workplace.\n6) Returning to item 1, we can therefore conclude that the question is asking where each can have each other's company at someone's house or someone's place of work. \n7) All the other options thus fail to fulfil this requirement and are therefore not correct. \n8) Since both home and work are locations, a person may have a friend's home and work by working in the friend's home and having their friend at their place of work.\n9) The idea of having someone at your place of work can also be possible since it's entirely up to the person where they decide to go to work at. \n10) So from the choices offered, the options that fit the bill best are A: place of work and B: friend's home.\n11) But since more than one option can work, we then must consider the possibility of having them share time at both places, or at one place, in which case A: place of work, B: friend's house, and C: workplace are all correct ones.\nSo the final answers are A: place of employment B: friend's place, and C: work\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions.

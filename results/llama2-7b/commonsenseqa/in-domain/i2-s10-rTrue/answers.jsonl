We know that the famous places mentioned in the question are in cities.\n4. The first option, J: Boston (a place), can be ruled out because 'famous', as used here, does not describe anything that is inherently famous.\n5. This leaves us with the rest of the options. All of the rest of the options have been used as descriptors of places.\nIn order to solve this further, look at the place where the famous place is used. For example - New Haven has already been used as a description of the place, so we know - A: Boston, B: Chicago, C: San Francisco, D: Atlanta, E: New Haven. In one of the options, \"famous\" has been used as an adjective to describe the place name - in New Haven in our case. So, we can rule out - A, B, D, and E.\n6.

The second option, 'falling down,' can only be confused for'staying down,' but the question doesn't suggest'staying down.' \n5.'staying down' could also be interpreted as 'falling down,' hence eliminated.\n6.

Against B. Against C. Forsen D. Forward E. Against\nOutput: \"anti\" means the opposite or against. To find the definition of \"anti,\" we need to understand what is being defined, not just redefine it.\n\nThe prefix \"anti\" is defined in a general dictionary as: 1) in place of; in the stead of: 2) contrary to; opposed to.\n\nSince both meaning A and B are opposite definitions, they are incorrect.\n\nMeaning C, D, and E are not appropriate as they are generalizations rather than specific definitions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.

Please check the following choices.  [A] because it's very hot to eat [B] because it gets moldy very quickly [C] only a knife can slice it neatly [D] because the skin is very hard [E] because the cut needs protection from a knife\nOutput: 1). The question asks about why one requires a knife to slice a pineapple. \n2). Since a pineapple is fruit, the question is likely about the 'fleshy' portion of a pineapple. Let us now find the correct answer by assessing the answer choices: \n3). Answer choices A and D are false. Although pineapples are sliced with knifes, this does not answer the question about why one uses a knife, since this can happen for several reasons other than not knowing the answer in the context of this question. \n4). Answer choice B is true. It is quite possible for pineapples to mold quickly. \n5). Answer choice C is therefore true since pineapples need knives to slice it neatly. \n6).

After analyzing the options, it's clear that C:stress is not an appropriate answer. While we can clean for hours without feeling stress(it's not a life threatening activity),we can also get stressed because the work is overwhelming or requires hard mental effort. \n\n4. D: boredom is a suitable answer in some cases. One can get bored while doing housework, however it's not always the case as we can get absorbed in the task. \n\n5. B: not bored is the simplest way to state the fact that one might get bored while doing hours of housework. \n\n6. Since A: anger & E: nervousness both fall under negative states of mental & emotional health, we can eliminate them. \n\n7. On analyzing all the options, it can be seen that A: anger & F: anxiety are the most suitable options. Anxiety is a form of stress after all. \n\n8. B: not boring is also acceptable. However, in most cases housework is mundane, routine house chores and usually gets over in an hour or two. We seldom get bored doing housework and thus C: Stress is incorrect. \n\n9.

It simply means it can be observed by 'when you do what'. 3. In order to test this information, let's evaluate each of the choices. \n4. Option A: 'Go to church' is a location, but the question doesn't state you should go to church to observe spirituality changing lives. \n5. Option B: 'Appear in court'. The question specifically states 'when you do what', not 'when you appear in court'. This option doesn't qualify. \n6. Option C: 'Watch soap operas'. This again refers to an activity rather than to a place, so it doesn't match the question. \n7. Option D: 'Paying attention'. This fits the bill.

The clue, the store sells items designed especially for children, indicates the need to locate a place dealing in children's goods, such as toys. Hence, the correct answer is C: a toy store.\n2. The reason the speaker'says no' to shopping is probably because she is aware that the store does not sell children's items, so the choices are ineffective since they do not point to a suitable place.\n3. The clue, \"the store sells items designed specifically for children\", indicates the need to locate the exact opposite, that is, a shop that does not sell items designed specifically for children.

Accordingly, the chair can be folded up and stored. \n2.\"Planning not to use it\" means that the chair will not be used immediately after being bought, or at all unless there is a specific occasion. \n3.\"Large doors\" implies having a door that is both wide and tall. A typical door would suffice. \n4.\"You do not have any large (wide/tall) doors in your house\" means that the homeowner does not have any doors comparable to the door used in the illustration. As such, it will be impractical to simply store the chair at the wide/tall door's location. \n5. We can eliminate \"B\" as the term \"Roof\" means a top-most layer of something, and a \"Folding Chair\" does not usually have a roof. \n6. We can eliminate \"C\" too, as a beach is typically not associated with \"closet\". \n7. Finally, there's no place for the chair to physically fold up since \"closet\" means a place for your clothes and \"garage\" means a place for vehicles. The chair's legs will be placed in a tight space and so, would folding it be practical? \n8. We can identify the only remaining choice as E:Garage.

Choices: 1) A: cotton swab B) a small brush C) a mouthwash D) a band to keep your gums wet E) an eyedropper\nOutput: 1) The question asks what a doctor uses at the end of a clean toothbrush to prevent your teeth from getting sore. \n2) We know that a toothbrush is used for cleaning teeth and not for applying protective measures. \n3) Moreover, the doctor should use some kind of protective measure to prevent you from bleeding when brushing, therefore it should not be a brush. \n4) Hence, the options B and C can be eliminated as they are brushes. \n5) Additionally, the option E is irrelevant since it is a tool used for taking medicine and not for applying protecting agents. \n6) Thus, only choice D can be the correct answer as it is a band used to make gums wet and therefore make them less prone to irritation \nSo the final answer for the question is: E: an eyedropper", "answer": "E: big house"}

'Over to': here is an idiom referring to moving/travelling/going toward somewhere. \n4. 'Fairgrounds': the answer does not refer to having food at fairs but is a noun referring to 'grounds where fairs are held'. \n5. 'Picnic': is a word for an informal dinner outdoors. \n6. 'Friend's house': This does not make sense as a person wouldn't expect to have food prepared by someone else if he were bringing it himself.\n7. 'Table': Table is a generic term, is not describing a specific location and therefore, does not provide an answer to the question.\n8.

However, they are not sushi restaurants.\n- Option D (atlantic ocean) is not related to the question at all which means that this option is incorrect/not suitable.\nIt's then necessary to figure out whether the person in the question is Sam or if the place is a sushi restaurant. Luckily, we read that Sam \"ordered a blowfish\". What we should then find out is which sushi restaurant this is.\nAfter analyzing the words: \"at\" and \"restaurant\", we can conclude this is referring to an actual restaurant where people go to dine out in. It looks like we're going to have to guess one of the options from before that's a sushi restaurant and also matches our logic. Out of the options provided, C (fish market) fits the bill since some fish markets sell sushies.

A: stomach empty 2. B: apple cider 3. C: more apples 4. D: less apples 5. E: nothing\nOutput: 1) The question implies that you ate an apple because it's empty, but since we've been told that eating an apple makes you hungry and thus, still gives you a sense of being empty, we can infer that the apple won't magically make you feel full, even if you ate it. Hence, the answer is 1) Stomach empty\n2) Apple cider can potentially be the answer since the dictionary definition of apple cider does state that it consists of the juice of the apple, along with the pulp.

This implies that the store is open during certain hours of the day. \n2: The next clue is the use of adjectives to describe the hours \"Monday to Friday\". This indicates that there may be some breaks in between the business hours. \n3: The phrase \"10h to midnight B: 5h\" also suggests that the store is always open every day, which eliminates options C and D. \n4: Therefore, the only remaining options are A, B, and F. \n5: The correct final answer is F: all days(24 hours) because the question has mentioned that the store is open to public(everyone); hence, there is no need for time constraint.\nSo the final result is \" all days (24 h)\"", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

Receiving a certain amount could bring relief and happiness, but this is a positive, not a negative emotion. \nB: paying bills - The answer could have been paying bills. This would be relevant if you got paid and had to pay someone else using that money. However, if we are talking about getting paid, there is no obligation to do this.

When you want something, and then you either don't get it, or if you get it, you don't get the value you wanted out of it, you feel frustrated. So you could imagine frustration when getting paid.

{"text": "1) The question is asking about a massive building that is not constructed well.\n2) The question isn't referring to buildings that are not well-constructed at all, but rather to the possibility that they may be unable to support their own weight.\n3) The first option, A, would be the most obvious choice if one were referring to a building's structural integrity in general.\n4) However, this would not be the intended choice because a massive building that is \"insubstantial\" would likely also be unable to support its own weight.\n5) Similarly, the second option, B, is similar in its implication that a building may not be able to support its own weight and therefore also ineligible as a valid answer.\n6) On the other hand, the third option C, being \"dwarf\" is a building that is very small, inadequate to the weight, it can not support more its own weight; it is constructed properly, the building is good, it is not insignificant. \n7) Therefore, the correct answer to this question is E:  \"good\".", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}
{"text": "1: The question is asking about the type of home sought by a household that moved out of the city. \n2: The term'master bedroom' refers to a large bedroom or sleeping space reserved for the most important members of the household. This usually refers to the owner or head of the home and their spouse or partner. \n3: The first option, 'large house', is not relevant because it does not reference a specific room. \n4: The second option,'suburban home', could potentially be the correct answer. Homes in suburban areas are often characterized by spacious lawns and ample room for private gardens. These features allow for the possibility of a large bedroom, a feature that is relevant to our question. \n5: Considering the importance of the term'master' in the question and the second option,'suburb' may seem like potential correct answer, this requires us to take a closer look at each of the other remaining options. 6: Combining this information with our assessment of the options, the third option, 'big house', is the only plausible answer. This does not specify a specific room, but simply refers to a large home. The term'master bed', which is a common feature in large homes, is still relevant, and 'house' is also mentioned in the question. \n7: Finally, the fourth option, 'old house' is not relevant because it simply refers to a house of previous age(not the kind of home of interest), so we can eliminate it from consideration. 8: Based on our assessment of all the options, the most logical answer is 'big house', which refers to a home with sufficient space to accommodate a large bedroom. \nSo the final answer here is B: big house\n\nInput: A large cage is placed near large glass doors, What is the purpose?

{"text": "1: The statement \"While chatting with friends\" suggests that the conversation was happening in person and over the phone.\n2: The other terms that stand out in this sentence are \"discover\" and \"talking.\" The second suggests that discovering something new while talking with friends is quite unlikely in a person's normal daily conversation.\n3. The other terms that stand in contrast to the others are \"agreement\" and \"misunderstanding,\" which can make continue a conversation more likely.\n4. This means that the likely responses are B: to fill their times or E: to learn about.\n5. Since continuing the conversation is unlikely if it is simply an agreement or misunderstanding, the best response is E: to learn about, as it describes a situation when people decide to continue the conversation because there is interest in learning more.\nSo the final answers is E: to be interested in learning more", "answer": "E: learning about"}
{"text": "1 The question asked about what Janet was feeling in her dying moments before her body stopped responding. \n2. Sleeping longer, stopping breathing and death are all possible indications of dying from injuries. As long as one's heart is still beating, the body functions, breathes, and is alive. \n3. The correct answer is given by the word 'change of color' because once the body dies, it will not continue to function on its own. The body's color will change with the blood's oxygen, therefore revealing the body's lifeless state. \n4. If one is in pain from the injuries or is tired due to the long wait, sleeping longer could also be an indication of one's life ending. \n5. If someone is getting colder, it means that their body has stopped responding and is moving in the direction towards death, just like in the case of someone who is getting cold.\n6. Hence, the correct answer for the question would be the word 'change of colour'.\nSo the final answer will be 5: change of color", "answer": "B: getting cold"}

Therefore, the correct answer to the question is a form which means 'to be made extra strong'. As an indication of this, 'flimsy' is the only answer which does not use the words strong or extra.

The last stop of any bus network is the end station (where a bus usually ends its route).\nSecondly, we ask what the destination or final stop of a bus is.\nLooking at the first answer, A: Central Square, we find the information we need to answer the second question.

Thus, this places the answer in a more likely 'indoor' space. The same can be applied for options B and C: they refer to 'living room' and 'tennis court' respectively. \n3) The other options, D and E, are outdoor spaces and hence can be excluded.  \n4) The last option, D, refers to a specific tennis court. \n5) Thus, the correct answer for the given set of choices is C: tennis court. \nSo the final answer to the question is C: tennis court\n\nInput: What do you do if no one is at your home?

'Having money', on the other hand, can simply mean having wealth already at hand rather than having to earn the money through work first. \n4) 'Making money' and 'having money' can both be suitable options depending on one's perspective. While one could argue that making more money to then spend it on household goods is making the house, in this context it refers to the idea of having money available at hand to pay bills rather than actually creating the necessities through one's work. \n5) 'Keep house' refers more to one's household rather than one's profession. It does not refer to making money, which makes it an irrelevant answer.\n6) Combining all the information above, we see that the only reasonable answer is B: make money as'make money' and 'happen' share a similar meaning of \"create something through efforts\", which is what being able to pay blls refers to in this case.\nSo the final answers is B: make money\n\nInput: What would you do, if you heard a knock at the door and didn't answer?

Alcohol cannot only be consumed indoors and is therefore not a suitable option.\n6.'Neighbor's house' can potentially mean a place where Jimmy can get beer.

Copy: One with a photographic memory or one who can memorize easily would be able to easily grasp hard concepts. \n5. Since we need at least moderate intelligence and photographic memory to achieve this, both A: 'intelligent' and B: 'copy' can be incorrect answers. \n6.

B: infommercial is not a suitable answer either. The term 'infomercial' refers to a sales pitch, and although the 'pitch' could be broadcast on television, this means that it is being given by the person selling (i.e. the seller) rather than the buyer.\n3.

The musical instrument is typically played in an orchestra or some kind of band, like school band, music store, opera. \n3) If one uses only the text, it's logical to pick A: orchestra, since one gets the bass clarinet there, which was asked for in the question. \n4) While A: orchestra sounds as a correct answer, on second thought, a woodwind instrument, like a clarinet, is not typically played in an orphan, so we can eliminate choice A: orchestra.\n5) The next reasonable choice would be the place to get a clarinet is a music store, but clarinet and bass clarinet are different types of clarinet. \n6) The next reasonable place to get a bass clarinet is the opera, but clarinet is not a part of an opera band. \n7) Combining all the aforementioned information, the only suitable choice would be D: opera house, since a woodwind instrument is played in an opera.

So A: Australia and B: Brazil were considered but eliminated 4) Based on the wording of the question, E: France was also considered to be a plausible answer. \n5) As an ancient rock formation is likely to be an historical feature, it does not necessarily matter whether the country is modern, rich, or even rich in terms of their historical heritage. It makes sense for the person to visit France because it is a country rich in history. \n6) Hence, we can conclude the answer is, E: France\n\nSo the final", "answer": "C: building"}

The question is \"What is likely to be a goal of telling many people...\" which means it's asking which of the goals listed might be the reason why many people would want to get word of a new organization. Since the question is about a goal, it's logical that we would want to choose the goal that will satisfy that question.\n2. If the goal of telling many is \"to accomplish\" then the end result could mean reaching the goal itself or the goal being done and the person is happy about it. However, since the question is asking about a \"goal\", in this case specifically, the word \"goal\" implies that the outcome is not just reaching a goal but also showing it, in this case the way to accomplish it. So accomplishing the goal includes showing it off and it's this aspect that tells us it is \"learning about\" and it is the last option provided in the choices.\n3. A: accomplish - we can eliminate this since we've already decided it is accomplishing and that accomplishing includes \"learning about\".\n4.

We can immediately eliminate the first option C: go somewhere - it involves traveling somewhere which requires curiosity.\n4. We can also eliminate the fifth option E: see the favorite show since that typically requires interest and curiosity.\n5. Next, examine the second and third options. These involve viewing into a reflective surface like a mirror, which does not require much curiosity to be enjoyed. Therefore, we can eliminate these options as well.\n6. Lastly, we are left with three options: examining thing, staring at someone/something and hearing news.\n7. The first option, examining thing, does not require much curiosity since you're actively observing something rather than watching a passive film. It doesn't require much curiosity to be done, thus it's a wrong answer.\n8. We can discard the second option, staring at someone or something, since that doesn't require much focus or attention, so it can be completed with little curiosity. It's also not a type of film that one would typically watch at a movie theater.\n9. Therefore, we are left with the third option: hear news.

It is a type of depressive disorder defined by low mood, which is a symptom of stress rather than a cause of stress. \n3. The third option, B: heart attacks, is also not the effect of stress but rather, the symptom of stress. Similarly, it is not the cause of stress.\n4.

The last remaining options are thus E: headache and D: hair loss. Both involve stress and hair loss is a plausible effect of stress, \n7. However, the fact that the options were presented in a logical order makes us evaluate option E: headache first. \n8. Although hair loss may indicate stress, some people have hair loss due to other causes. Therefore, hair loss is not the effect of stress \n9. while headaches can be an effect of stress. Thus, option E: headache is the correct answer as it is the only one among the remaining options that is the effect of stress. \n10. When this option is eliminated, the remaining choice is option D: hair loss. While hair loss can be an effect of psychological stress, it is not the only one and, in turn, not a definitive effect.

'Property' is a location that can range in size from a yard to a neighbourhood, and therefore, one can't conclude that it could be considered as 'tiny'.\n6. The only option left with is 'yards'. So, considering the answer's correct placement and all the rules mentioned above, the correct answer would be A: farmland.\nSo the final Answer is\nA - Farmland\n\nInput: At what type of store would you buy items such as handmade jewelry and pottery? Choices: \nA: flea market B: pawn shop C: antique shop D: craft store E: mall\nOutput: It would be easy for many, but in this particular case, a lot of factors would have to be considered.\n1. The term \"handmade jewelry\" does not seem to make it a flea market. Flea markets usually consist of items that are found in homes and are either damaged, or otherwise unusable.\n\n2. Pawn shops typically also sell used and sometimes damaged/broken items, but they are not necessarily handmade.\n\n3. Antique shops could be an option, but would it really be practical to buy handmade items here?\n\n4. Craft stores are often filled with items that are available anywhere in stores like Walmart, Target, etc. They typically sell mass produced items and usually do not carry any items which are handmade.\n\n5. Malls are definitely not a place where one could find such an item, as they typically contain many of", "answer": "C: city"}

The first option, 'A: That she was tired', the girl never got to the end of the evening. And, it is not a discovery, but just a fact that has not been discussed yet.\n2. The second option, 'B: That she was too thin', states that she realized that she was not very thin. However, this answer doesn't indicate what she discovered after trying out all the buttons.\n3. The third option, 'C: That she was not tall', isn't even a real option; the character wasn\u2019t trying to discover that she was not tall.\n4. The fourth option, 'D: That she was in the big building', could seem like a plausible answer, but it doesn\u2019t indicate what she discovered. The question explicitly asks what she discovered.\n5.

He could put his balls 'in motion' again when he woke up, but not when he was sleeping. 4. Thus, the correct choice is D: \"in motion\" was the last state of rest before James woke up, and it'll be the first state of motion afterwards. 5.

{"text": "1.'At home' is a clue that the answer should be something that the person did not go to regularly.

B: vacation can be taken at any place but again doesn't answer the question, because the place is not frequent. \n4. C: idle can refer to any activity at home, but we need more clues to determine what exactly 'idle' refers to.\n5. D: apartment doesn't make sense either, especially since the person was uncomfortable. The house is the opposite of an apartment, which is generally considered more comfortable. Additionally, an apartment is not a place that one would be afraid to go to.\n6. E: neighborhood is too broad of an area to be able to pinpoint exactly where the person was uncomfiortable. \n7. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is not in ANY of the aforementioned options. \n8. The answer must, at the very least, involve going outside. Since the person didn't go where ever outside, we know that 'outside' is a key word. \n9. It must involve a place that is generally assumed to be safer, comfortable, and reliable. 10.

A basement would likely be able to provide for both of these things, hence the first step is to plug in water first to boil. \n4. Plugging an RV to cook food would not occur at a school. An RV is not for living. Even if it was, it would only bring one to a location where the RV is plugged in. \n5. He would not plug into the building as it's not an office. John must be somewhere open to walk around in order to get back to the location from which the RV started. \n6. Lastly, rest areas are used to relax and rest, not to plug in an RV. \n7.

If the shore was a fishing town, then it must have moved away from it's location as a fishing place and hence it is no longer a fishing town. We are then left with only the shore. \n5) When the shore was a fishery town, there wasn't much of a tourist population in the towns as it was known as a fishing town. The shops also must have served or sold fishing equipment and supplies, the opposite of being a tourist place. The only places that would sell things to tourists would be nearby resorts, so our answer is either C: ocean or resort. \n6) Ocean is a stretch, the shore was a shoreline on an ocean, the ocean might also be an option, but the ocean itself isn't a locality the way the shore is, it would be better to pick C: resort. \n7) The answer is C: resort.\nSo the final Answer is C: resort", "answer": "A: seaside town"}

Looking at the 5 locations, river/stream is not relevant since it's more of a way to get access to fish- rather than the location itself. \n4. Lake is the only body of water in a location where it would be possible to fish as a fisherman. \n5. Dock is a place by the water where boats are docked; again, the question doesn't explicitly specify that the fisherman in question is going by boat. \n6. Fishing shop is not where one would go if they were a fisherman. 7. Therefore, in summary, lake is the only appropriate answer and correct.\nSo the final answers is C: lake\n\nInput: Where do you go if you read books?

After attending a speech, he might listen to it in his car, his desk, his living room, his office, etc. But in order for this to answer the question, we need to be more specific and state the location where it seems most likely he attended the speech. \n3.) Thus, the choices are limited to C: high school, D: somewhere, and E: theater. \n4.) Jan could easily go to high school in order to attend an event. Also, he could be any location, but it isn't explicitly stated. Finally, he could be attending the event in the theater as it seems more likely than the latter two options.\n5.)

A: rain B: rainbow C: white chickens D: chickens E: white fences\nOutput: 1) The question is asking what a red wheelbarrow represents. \n2) In order to answer the question, one needs to consider both what words are used and also which words are not used. \n3) For example, a \"rainbow\" and \"rain\" are not used in the line \"The red wheelbarrow glared...\", and thus cannot be a suitable answer since they are not used in the lyrics. \n4) Similarly, white chickens and white fences are also not mentioned in the song, however, if we had more context about the red wheelbarrow we could have chosen any of these words for the red wheelbarrow as they are used in the other half of the phrase, as the wheelbarrow glared, not the fences. \n5) Using all this context, we can eliminate all the answers that do not contain any of the words used in the sentence such as A: rain, B: rainbow, C: white chickened, and D: chickens. \n6) Thus, the correct option is E: white fences as red wheelbarrow glares at white fences. Now there is no ambiguity in terms of the location since white fences can only be found in the country.", "answer": "B: high school"}

D: let him try 5. E: play with him often\nOutput: 1) Since the parent wouldn't like to keep the child from trying to eat a rock, since it's dangerous. Hence, the parent wouldn't give such an instruction. 2) Cooking meals has nothing to do with stopping the child from eating rocks. 3) Giving him toys might do the trick, but also might not. 4) Letting the child try has nothing to do with solving the problem. Letting the child try means we would let the child eat the rock. 5) Playing with the child every day is not the reason of the child's eating habit of rocks.

{"text": "The question asks which piece of technology was cutting edge in earlier times while nowadays it is considered smart. \n2. Based on the wording of the question, we can eliminate the options that are contemporary: A: mobile phone, B: wristwatch, and C: briefcase.\n3. Looking at these options, it seems probable that the correct answer would be either D: office or E: desktop. People could have had smart ones in offices as smartphones didn't exist in earlier times, therefore office would fit the description. The same could also be said of a desktop as they were used in early systems which could have been considered cutting edge. \n4. However, these options also become impossible to choose when considering the other available options. \n5. Both D: office and E: desktop involve a place while the other options - A: mobile phone,  B: wristwatch and C: briefcase - don't involve such reference points. \n6.

Similarly, the term 'bus station' does not match the context. There is no need for public transportation in a friend's house and there are no buses in a neighbor's house.\n5.) At school could also be a potential answer because this is typically the venue for meetings and class-related activities, but it refers to a place to go to in order to study rather than to meet a friend.\n6.)

Choices: \ud83c\udd95 A: eat B: cry C: touch D: sleep E: think\nOutput: 1) The question asks how a person would be holding his/her hands while deciding what to answer. 2) The term 'eat' does not match since it is not a physical activity related to the question. \n3) The term 'cry' may refer to a person crying in the middle of answering a question but that would be unusual and strange. Hence, can be eliminated as well. \n4) The term 'touch' does not match since the question uses 'trying' to decide.

Thus, we can eliminate this option as well. 8) 'think' is a potential answer. It may be said that it's possible to think while deciding what to do or how to answer but the term 'think' does not describe a specific physical action. \n9) Hence, the only remaining option, E: think, is the correct one.\nSo the final answered is E: think\n\nInput", "answer": "D: neighbor's house"}

However, based on the first sentence of this question, we can eliminate the sailboat and paddleboat options since those vessels do, in fact, require helms. \n3. A'ship' is a large vehicle used by the navy or military. We can eliminate the'ship' option since a helm is not a part of a ship. \n4. In the same way, a'motorboat' is a boat with a motor on it, not a sail. We can eliminate the motor option. \n5.

Choices: 1. A: the one who invented them 2. B: an animal with a painful tooth 3. C: a word with an oddly painful sound 4. D: a word that has painful connotations\nOutput: 1: A: I disagree. This may have been the most painful word in the past because they were used to control and hurt people, but now the word'spur', and associated items, refer to sports competitions like jockeys or cyclists, which involve racing. These competitions and items promote speed, efficiency, and teamwork. They also inspire people to work hard to improve their lives. In conclusion, while the word \"spur\" is undoubtedly an uncomfortable word to hear, in the contemporary context, I believe that the word no longer incites negative feelings. \n2. B: I do not think an animal with a \"painful tooth\" will result in the worst pain ever. First, a painful tooth (or painful spot in general), will only cause pain if one is biting it or it becomes infected. However, a person feeling like they are on the wrong side of a spur (which is shaped like a knife) can suffer the worst emotional and mental distress one can experience.  Second, to answer this question, I must first explain what spurs are. They are curved blades attached to the spurs of horses. The sharp spurs are usually driven into the sides and lower flank of the horse in order to make it move faster. Although the intention differs in many places, spurring a horse with one's feet remains a popular and enjoyable sport", "answer": "B: buzz"}

{"text": "1.\u201cGreat joy \u201d is what the woman expressed, and this joy cannot be sadness, bad time, or sorrow. \n2. Therefore, the only thing it can be is happiness or joy.\n3. Since the sentence contains an adjective phrase \u201cgreat joy\u201d, we know that the answer is a compound word and not a phrase.\n4. The phrase \u201cDespite that this was a great joy \u201d means that the joy she felt could\u2019ve been any other emotion, for example, a bad time.\n5. Therefore, we can cross out the compound word happiness and the word great, since they would not fit into the sentence. \n6. After removing those two things, the phrase becomes \u201cDespite this was a joy \u201c, and therefore the answer would be either \u201cjoy\u201d or \u201cthis\u201d.\n7. Since joy cannot possibly be an \u201cthis\u201d in this sentence, the correct answer is \u201cjoy\u201d.\nThus the correct answer is a: joy\n\nInput:What did the girl look into?

Hence, it is not the most likely answer.\nUpon evaluating the previous options, the sixth option, D Idaho is the most likely answer as the only options that can not be located in a city, and hence have the most plausibility as the most likely answer. \n\nThus, the final answer is D Idaho\n\nInput: The shops which are located on the Main Street are in the center of the city, where the business area is located.

{"text": "1. The question is about what John has to watch them do, so it's important to understand who John is and what he is doing to understand the correct answer.\n2. John is studying animals, thus by definition, he is a student. He would most likely be spending time studying and observing animals in a laboratory setting, typically.\n3. Animals do not bathe in the lab and would generally not die of cancer in the lab.\n4. Animals may exhibit behaviors like dying of cancer or copulating outside of the lab, but this is irrelevant to the question.\n5. Hence, it is safe to eliminate answer choices A: bathe, B: bite, C: die of cancer, and D: obesity.\n6. Answer choice E: copulate can be used to correctly answer this question, as John is watching animals and has to watch their copulating behavior. \nSo the final answer here is D: Copulate\n\nInput: What was John\u2019s job? Choices:  1. A: Engineer  2. B: Cook  3. C: Waiter  4. D: Pilot  5. E: Police Officer\nOutput: 1: 1. We are looking for John's job. From the options provided, we see that two options are careers (i.e., Engineer, etc.) and three are jobs (i.e., cook, waiter, pilot etc.).  Hence the correct option here is 1: Engineer.\n2: From the choices, we can first understand that the careers which end with 'er' are engineering and surgeon, and the jobs which end with 'er(cook). Since engineering is a job which ends with the spelling of 'er'.

However, both B: air and C: fountain refer to air, with the latter option, also being a water fountain. Both of these options thus need exclusion, thus we're left with D: swamp.\n5.

Choices: \n\nA: trunk\nB: kitchen\nC: basement\nD: garage\nE: attic\n\nOutput: \nI. The question asks about putting laundry in a place. It is therefore not talking about the act of doing laundry but about the kind of place where we could hang or lay our laundry down to dry. \n2. Using the term \"has no other choice\" narrows down the options to D: garage which is an ideal place to wash laundry while avoiding exposure to elements, as mentioned in the hint: \"no other choice\". \n3. Hence garage stands as the best answer.\n\nSo the final answer: D: garage<br>\n\nInput:Where is the grocery store that was the talk of the town?

{"text": "1.'Heifer' can be replaced by cow. \"Heifer is a young cow (female bovine cattle) between one and two years of age that has not yet given birth to a calf.\". Since the word cow is used and there is no mention of cow milk, the animal here is most likely a dairy cow. \n2.\"out east\" means going east, which is the opposite to the west. \n3. As mentioned above, the word East is synonymous with directions. Thus, the question can be best answered by determining what the word East signifies. The question states two words, out and east, hence the phrase 'out east', to which east can be replaced with a place name. \n4. As a result, the question is asking us to identify a place on the East coast of the United States. \n5. The word 'cow' or 'heifer' can often be used interchangeably with the word 'cattle' as mentioned in the answer to part 1. \n6. The last phrase in this section states \"Where is a place we might end\"? This is indicative that a specific place name (city or state) is required to complete the answer. A place name on the East coast of United States that can fit is most likely New-York or, if we take into account the'might', then Massachusetts. \n7. Finally, since the question is asking about the East coast of the US, Texas, New Hampshire, County fair or Dairy farm are unlikely to be suitable options. \n8. Therefore, we can deduce that the most likely answer choice is B: Dairy Farm since New-York was omitted, but otherwise it would have been the answer.\nSo the final is B: Dairty Farm\n\nInput: My daughter's getting her ears pierced at what kind of establishment?

A movie theater is not a place for ear piercing.", "answer": "A: new hampshire"}

Choices: 1. At the grocery store 2. The first hour you enter the library 3. The first two hours you enter the grocery store, or 4. The newspaper will never go on sale 5. The first hour after the news has been delivered\nOutput:\n1. The first choice, A: at the grocery store, is a place to find newspapers, so it is excluded.\n2. The second choice, B: the first hour you enter the public library, isn't a time but a day, so it is exluded.\n3. The third choice, C; the first two hours you enter a grocery store, isn't the best time either since it doesn't answer when's the best time is.\n4. The fourth choice, D: newspaper will never go on sales, isn't excluded since it's a possible answer.\n5. The fifth choice, E: the first hour after the news is delivered, is a time frame, not a location, so it is excludes.\n6.

{"text": "1 and 2. We know that a capybara is usually found in the rainforest and cannot be found in a toy store or a zoo. \n3. We are only concerned about captive monkeys, not other animals. The term 'capybara' only refers to monkeys.\n\n4. The answer might seem to be in the great outdoors from observing the hint since some places in the great outdoosrs have monkeys, like zoos. \n5. This hint only tells us that a captive monkey could indeed be out in the great outdoored, but says nothing about whether it's in the same area as the captive monkey.\n6. Furthermore, it could refer to the great outdoors within the monkey's habitat, which might contain other monkeys. \n\n7. Hence, we eliminate A: rain forest and all the other options, since they are not related to any animals in the great outdooors and may not be the answer.\n8. After considering multiple options, we realize that B: tree tops is the only one that could pass the criteria. A monkey in a tree could be found outdoors as well, but we don't want other animals outside the monkey's species, and the tree is a different location.\n9. Thus, the correct option is B: tree tops.

Thus, we can conclude that we may not see other colors in car tires if they happen to be that color. However, this does not mean it wouldn't be possible to. \n7: It may be possible for blue car tire to exist because", "answer": "D: zoological gardens"}

D: smile E: nodded\nOutput:1. Question asks how to be polite. 2. Politeness can be defined in many ways, but 'using proper manners' is a direct description of that, akin to 'being polite' 3. 'Give respect' is also indirectly related to proper manners 4. Nodding is not necessarily polite. You may be not agreeing with someone, but not be able to say it through voice or body language. This is unlike use of proper manners, where you agree with the person's viewpoint or act accordingly. 5. 'Using proper manners' thus, is the correct choice. 6. 'Listen' isn't always needed to be polite. And the other options are also not necessarily required to be politeness.

If the people want to travel through/visit countryside and beach areas (which can be developed), the choice would be between B: united states + A: countrysides.\nBut both B: united states and A: countrysideroute do not fit in the question as they were on the countryside. \n4. Combining all this information, we can deduce that D: atlas is most likely the correct answer since it's the only option that fits in the question and the hint.

Yes, because the question doesn't state any specific location apart from'stray dog.' \nb) Animal shelter? Yes, because this is a place that provides or works with animals. It could potentially contain cats or dogs of any size. \nc) Georgia? No, we cannot infer that this is a location to get a dog based on the given information. \nd) Pet shop? No, they typically sell dogs to families who can afford them, rather than offering stray dogs. \ne) Dog show? No, we can't say for certain that a dog show is a place to get a strayed small puppy or rescue a dog from an animal shelter if needed. \n3) There are only two options in this question where it can be assumed that a dog is being offered or taken away from them: living room & animal shelter.\n4) Given the context of the question and the other possibilities that are not likely to contain any stray dogs, the two remaining options are the most plausible. \n5) Living room isn't a place where animals live, and stray dogs are usually not taken to a living room, so we can exclude it from consideration.\n6) Taking the remaining option, the animal shelter is the most plausible answer. It provides shelter to animals and could house stray dogs if found.

{"text": "1st option is dirt. \n2nd option is fingernails. \n3rd option is garden. \n4th option is corner. \n5th option is computer. \n6th option is closet. \n\nDirt (can also be called soil) grows from things, such as, vegetable seeds. So, when a plant grows, it releases seeds and the seed grows into dirt.\n\nWhen storing soil, one needs to keep it in a container with water, sunlight and the nutrients it needs to grow. The nutrients that each type of plant needs vary. Therefore, the plant would depend on these nutrients at different times. For example, when a carrot is growing, it receives nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. But, as the carrot matures, its ability to receive these nutrients diminishes.\n\nThe container needs to have holes so that air is free in and out. The hole must also allow water to pass in and out. To prevent loss of water, one must cover the container with a cover. These covers, usually clear plastic, are called bell jars.\n\nThe purpose of covering the containers with bell jars is to keep bugs off. The bell jar would also help one's house from getting infested. The jar helps the soil stay moist, but it also stops harmful germs from being inside the soil. In particular, the bell jar prevents snails and other insects from coming near the soil.\n\nAll these reasons are why garden soil need to be stored in a bell jar. Bell jars come in all different sizes. The size that best fits one's plant is determined by the size of one's plant. For a carrot, one would use a bell jar that's about 14 inches high. Bell jars that are smaller are used for peas and other small plants. Bell jars that don't fit can crush the plant. A good size bell jar can prevent this problem from happening.\n\nSo the final answer that follows the question is B: garden.\n\nInput:Is a shoe store a clothing store?

{"text": "1: The question is asking what one uses to print things. To answer this question, one should first consider the word 'ink'. To print something, we use an ink (that is, one type of print medium). Ink is then delivered by a printer to the paper, which is inserted into the printer. \n2. Hence, the correct answer is E: printer. The word 'ink' is related to the printer, as it needs to be loaded into the printer's ink-cartridge in order to do its job.\n\nSame for another example:\n\nInput: What do you see on the first floor? Choices: 1: door 2: pink 3: flower vase 4: stairs 5: window\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about the first floor of a building, thus one must be looking down from the floor. \n2) As stairs leads from floor to floor, one sees them on a floor, but not on the first floor as stairs are not on the first floor of a house. Hence, the correct option is 4: stairs\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question as the above.\n\nInput: Do you need to go to the grocery to buy some flour? Choices:  a) yes b) no c) vegetables d) bread e) eggs\nOutput: 1). A flour is a grain flour and is a baking ingredient and not vegetables. Hence the correct answer should be \u201cno\".\n2. Grocery is a store and not a vegetables. Hence the right answer is \u201ce\u201d\n3. There is nothing named \u201cbread\u201d in the options and hence we should choose \u201cd\u201d\n4. The fourth option is a egg in the grocery store. hence we will choose \"d\"\nSo the final answer will be \u201cd\u201d", "answer": "E: printer"}
{"text": "1. The question asks us to identify the animal that doesn't go to Colorado, and thus doesn't go underground. \n2. 'Marmosets' are small monkeys, so the options that they don't usually go to are colorado, wilderness, underground. \n3. Colorado is not an option of where they don't usually travel since it is too large for a marmoset to travel to. \n4. 'Underground' is also disqualified since these monkeys do not travel to the underground like other species can. \n5. 'Wilderness' describes the places that aren't accessible for marmosets, but they don't usually stay in such locations for long periods. \n6. Hence, the only remaining option is B: dictionary as it can be assumed that marmosets don't usually travel to such locations, but would visit if they ever needed to. Thus, dictionaries are not a suitable habitat for marmosets, which is why no marmoset has been found in one before. \nSo the final answer could be A: dictionary.\nThe correct answer however is B: dictionary", "answer": "D: underground"}

If the murderer is a 'THEM' i.e the person to whom the statement is directed, then it makes no sense.\n\n2. E) The question says 'The police do not know who is doing this.' This means that it is the 'They' who dont know who the murderers are i.e Police here means the 'THEY'. But the murderers are 'THEM'. Hence answer choice E is incorrect.\n\n3. D) The question says 'THEY said nobody knows' where 'THEY' is the murderers. 'Nobody' means the people who are present in the room and are not the murderers. So this is clearly invalid.\n\n4.

The list of possibles \u201chad a fun\u201d is improbable because she would have only one talent, not several kinds.\n8. \u201cwas talented [for]\u201d is a sentence fragment and indicates that she would have only a single talent.\n9. Knack is also the name of a special ability as well as a hand tool, so the singular is also used to indicate a single talent.\n10.

Thus, a person who is greedy may not be qualified to work on a project as they might be motivated to prioritize their own needs over that of the project.\n4) On the other hand, a 'worry' is someone who feels stress or anxiety, so this individual might be more sensitive to the needs of the project and could be appropriate for working on a project.\n5) A 'knowledgeable' person generally refers to an individual who has a deep understanding of a specific subject. In the context of projects, this might be a desirable quality in a project manager.\n6) An 'individual who takes charge', on the other hand, is someone who is proactive and assertive, taking charge of tasks and responsibilities and actively driving progress.\n7) 'Boss' could seem like a good option at first, but it's most likely just that the person is managing a project, which is also a project to manage. \n8) The correct answer must be a choice that includes a personality characteristic that is related to project management and not specific to another job.\n9) After carefully considering all the options, the only one left that meets all these requirements is 'individual with knowledge'.

We know that rural areas are areas that are not cities, so we can eliminate that choice.\n5. The second choice (B: africa) is not opposite to a village, so we can eliminate A: rural area and B: africa as well.\n6. The third choice (C: ohio) must be the opposite of a village because a village is a small settlement and Ohio is a state; therefore we choose (C) ohio as our opposite of a village. Now, we go to our next choice (D: big city), which is the same as the second choice (B:africa).\n7. By excluding both those two choices, we are left with our final and only remaining answer as (D: Big City).\n8.

This stands as a more viable option compared to 'oceans'. \n3. The only inland body of water in the answer choices is D: bathe in. Although this could technically be an ocean, the term 'ocean' does not apply here, since 'oceans' are bodies of water that lie entirely within earth's boundaries while 'bathe in' refers to a body of water that is not the ocean.\n4. The fourth answer, 'the childrens pool' does not apply here because 'childrens pool' is a type of swimming pool meant for children only, it is not used by the locals on the aforementioned location.\n5. Finally, we are left with A: swimming pool and C: lake. Swimming pools do not fall under the answer choice of 'ocean' and lake does not refer to the inland lake that we are required to identify.

Choices: \nA: hardware store B: pharmacy C: office supply store D: market E: grocery store\nOutput:  The question asks us to identify a situation in which we would be able to find an object that could measure time. We would use one of these objects to show us the passing of time through seconds, minutes, hours, or days, depending on the object. The information provided suggests a clock is the best option, but we need to consider the other object options in the question,\n\n1. A hardware store offers clocks for sale, hence it is an option. If we had to find the time using a clock, we can find it here. And since clocks measure a fixed amount of time, it's a useful item.\n2. Pharmacy would only sell medications, hence not an option for our context.\n3. Office supply stores have various supplies, accessories, toiletries, etc. However, they do not sell or sell inexpensive clocks.\n4. Markets offer a wide variety of products, but not usually clocks.\n5. Grocery stores mostly offer food and other non-electronic items, so they are not an option here since our time measurement device here is electronic.", "answer": "C: inspiration"}

But since the question doesn't talk about any such museum or mention a shuttle, we can eliminate this option\n* The place doesn't have a door, so we can also eliminate the door option.\n* Also, there is no mention of any type of tent, so we can eliminate that too.\nLastly, we can eliminate any option that isn't a \"corner area\", such as a desk or bedroom.\nTherefore, the most logical option in this case is B: office.\nSo the final answers is B: office", "answer": "B: office"}
{"text": "1) The question asks about a large netted bag that one would carry to a certain place. It's important to keep the question's hint in mind, which reads as 'to a sort of place.' \n2) A) Airports are transit locations where people would typically carry a lot of necessary belongings. Thus, A: airport is a plausible location to which one would carry such a large netted drawing bag. \n3) In contrast, people do not usually carry a netted drawing bag when traveling via car. Also, a jewelry store would never be given such a bag either. \n4) The only remaining options (B/C) are both good guesses.

Who is your current vegetarian choice? ___? Choices: 1: A: Tofu 2: B: Bok choy 3: C: Tofu 4: D: Tofu 5: E: Tofu\nOutput: 1): One does not wish to be a vegetable when one commits violence (the answer given by the candidate). Hence, the vegetarian choice is not the candidate who has committed violence. It is important to note that the question does not ask about the candidate who *is* a vegetarian or who *has* committed violence.\n2): Tofu is the second vegetable in the first vegetarian vegetable sequence. Hence, the chosen vegetable must be tofu.\n3): The answer is bok choy, as the third vegetable in the series refers to it.\n4): The answer is Tofu (it is the fourth element in the sequence of vegetables).\n5): The answer is tofu (it is the last element in the vegetable sequence).\nHence, the answer is tofu as the second vegetable in an order of vegetables tofu and bok choy.\nSo the final input is A.\n\nInput:I'm 21 years old so", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

A yellow sign attached to the vehicle's front door does not necessarily mean it is an ambulance: therefore option B is incorrect.\n4. A police siren on top of an ambulance cannot be used as a sign: this is a sound which is unlikely to be seen as a sign: therefore option C is incorrect.\n5. An ambulance's colour can be white (like options D & E): however both options are incorrect as we do not know if the sign is the vehicle colour or not.

{"text": "1. The question asks about procreation or reproduction. If a person is attempting procreation or reproducing, it signifies that they have succeeded.\n2. The options are A: celebrate and B: have a party. Option A: celebrate does not fit the bill. One does not celebrate if they are reproducing. The sentence 'Hence, we can eliminate the idea of celebrating when one is attempting to reproduce.'supports our understanding.\n3. Option B: have a party also does not fit the bill because the meaning of 'have a party' is a different from procreation or reproducation. For example, one can have a party celebrating their birthday and have a baby at the same time, but there is no correlation or correlation between the two events. Therefore, option B: have a party does not fit the bill as it's clearly a different meaning than what was being asked for in the question.\n4, Option C: have crowd goes mad does not fit because it's different than success.\n5. Option D: create success is the only option that can be considered as success depends on the person's perspective that they have created themselves but it's not about the success of success itself. Hence, option D: create success does not fit as well.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is E: reproduce itself.

The cabin allows people to slow down and go to sleep and does not serve to slow down the airplane in the event of an emergency, since it can't speed up in the event of a crash, because crash means the plane has exploded in the air or on the ground.\n5. To carry people and not carry luggage implies the plane is carrying people, which is why A was eliminated.\n6. As an additional clue, the question includes the word \"live\" in the options list. Even though people can slow down, it is incorrect to say that the cabin is a place where people can live. The cabin serves as a place where passengers can slow down; it's not a home or place of residence.", "answer": "D: carry people"}
{"text": "After evaluating all the choices, we can conclude that 'class/school/college dorm' and 'backpack' are possible answers. The question asked where a binder can be bought, and both dorm and backpack, the places that a student can get the supplies he/she needs, can be considered as classrooms, since all students who attend classrooms need supplies such as binders, pens, notebooks, backpacks, etc. Therefore, for students in a classroom, buying a binder is a logical choice, hence we can assume that dorm and backpack both can be answers.\nOn the other hand, 'office supply store' is unlikely to represent a good answer. 'Office' is a distinct place from a classroom, as office workers' work environments are different from those of students, and supplies used by office workers are different from students too. 'Office supply store' is also not the only place where office workers can buy supplies, other places such as supermarkets and even hardware stores can sell them as well. Even though office workers can buy office supplies at a hardware store too, such a scenario cannot be reasonably assumed from the question provided us to answer, which is where you can buy a binder. So office supplies store cannot be assumed an answer.\n\nSince 'class/school/dorm' does not need to be the entire answer to a question, it can be eliminated. That leaves backpack as the possible answer. Backpack is the only remaining option that has classroom and dorm as factors, which would also include college to some degree. However, a college dorm is not always a place where students buy binders, hence we can eliminate this option as well. With no other remaining options, the only answer is 'backpack'.\nSo the final answer will be 'backpack'.\n\nInput:What is the difference between a computer keyboard and a computer mouse?

'Everything you touch' doesn't refer to a collection, and 'you touch' means to pick up/feel/touch.\n5.

Choices: 1. The air is cleaner 2. They don't release harmful gases 3. They have a longer lifespan 4. They provide renewable energy when fossil fuels run out 5. They reduce the need to import fuel from oil-producing countries\nOutput: 1, 2, 3, 5 are not correct because:\n\n1) A station is a location; we need to answer about the advantages of solar stations, not about the advantages of solar power.\n\n2) Solar power stations do release harmful gases, including Co2.\n\n3) Solar power stations have not been running for long enough to know their actual lifespan.\n\n4) Solar power stations provide energy, not renewable energy.\n\nSo the final answer the station gives us is 4) They reduce the need to imports fuel from oil producing countries, because solar power stations are not directly competing with oil for global markets. Instead, they're working towards reducing the global need for oil from producing countries.\n\nInput: What did John F. Kennedy do after winning the election to be president?\nOutput: I.

Since the response required is one specific option i.e. own house, then any other option would not be a suitable one to choose from. \n3) The reason for choice 'own house' as a response is to note that one will not'simply open up' a house. Opening up to a house implies that one will have to build a house from scratch. So it is unlikely that one would choose to go to a house and simply open up.\n4) Hence the choice of 'own house' is eliminated.\n5) Now, let's look at the rest of the options. \n6) Option A)'more rice', does not have a definite answer. If one has more rice then one can obviously choose to 'open' more rice. However, the option cannot be ruled out easily. \n7) Option B) 'warm coat' does not seem like a good respond to the scenario. As pointed out by one before, 'opening' something implies it has to be built or set up. But with 'warm coat' what is being opened is already a garment. Hence not suitable.\n8) Option C) 'light up' means to illuminate something. However, one does not 'open' a light, rather one just 'turns it on' and 'lights it up.' Hence not suitable.\n9) One final option left is option D)'read book'. In the scenario, an individual does relax by simply opening a book.

Choices: 1. A: breakfast 2. B: lunch 3. C: dinner 4. D: supper 5. E: tea\nOutput: 1.) The question asks about the most common time to eat a meal; hence, the question is related to time. \n2.) Since the second option, A: breakfast, is a meal, this option is possible. However, meals are usually eaten based on how much or little time one has during the day, so we can eliminate breakfast as it's usually eaten earlier in the day. \n3.) A: dinner is one of the major meals. So it makes perfect sense to answer this question.\n4.) B: lunch could be a meal that's eaten just after work. Hence it's possible.\n5.) C: supper is similar to dinner, just a little later in the day. However the latter phrase is usually used in countries other than the US, so we can eliminate supper.\n6.)

{"text": "1.'To agree' indicates assent or acceptance to an idea or statement. \n2. 'Like' is used in the social sense as in, 'I like that color dress'. The word 'like' may mean approval or a good opinion, but more often is used metaphorically, e.g.\"I don't like this song\", \"I like hamburgers with cheese\". \n3. 'Nodding' means the movement of the head up and down, especially in answer to an interlocutor.\n4. 'By wearing rings' doesn't mean agreement.\n5. 'Concordance' isn't a word people commonly use.\n6. 'Shake hands' is used in the sense of assenting, but the sentence does not indicate that this is a common way to agree. Further, it suggests that shaking hands, of itself, would be a way to indicate agreement.\n7. The sentences are not grammatically correct.\n8. The sentences are not coherent sentences.\n9. Therefore, the only answer choices that mean the same thing are Options A and Option B.\n10. In fact, \"I agree\" is a short and clear way of \"I agree with you.\"\n11.

In some cases, it's possible to see people at the gym to \"check\" their fitness etc. \n3. However, the question doesn't make much sense because the answer \"no\" or \"yes\" wouldn't change any thing in a gym. So the question is most likely trying to say whether someone was overdressed/underdressed or otherwise uncomfortable when at the gym. \n4. The correct answer is C: yes as it answers to why some one would feel uncomfortable i.e. uncomfortable due to overdressed/underdressed.\nThus the final answer is C: yes", "answer": "C: bite"}

However, since we asked for zoos, these other animal-related locales would not count as seeing animals, so we can eliminate B: workplace.\n5. Many cities have zoos or wildlife refuges, which makes seeing animals pretty common in northeastern cities. C: sky does not count, as it's not a place and does not have animals.\n6. It's not easy to see animals in New York City (except for rats, pigeons, and maybe squirrels!). D: New York City is a bad place to look for animals. It has no zoos.\n7.

{"text": "1-  The question mentions \"do\" which means humans do not need money to do what they are asked to do. When humans feel motivated to do something which can earn them money they should do it. Money is a necessity and people without money usually feel uncomfortable and unwell and have to struggle.

Humans get sick only if they are uncomfortable and living with uncomfortable conditions and they need money to get better.\n2- When humans feel loved or are in love with someone  then they can overcome all their troubles and live a long healthy life because they feel happy and comfortable. They fall in love and are happy. \n3- They have to work hard to earn money to overcome difficulties and live a happy life.\n4- So Option C and D may seem correct however when we analyze these two options we can conclude that A and B are only part of this statement they are the base for the complete statement so option c and d are totally wrong. \n5- Option A is also wrong because humans don't live forever they die after that. The question's statement mentions humans so humans can only give money as humans can work to earn money.\n6- Option B also does not complete the statement. Motivation is important but its not the only requirement for earning money. After all when humans eat or sleep they are also motivated but they are doing unproductive work. So option b is also wrong.\n7- Now coming to option E is the correct answer because it completes the whole statement and is the most correct option. Option E has all the details mentioned in the question's statement.

{"text": "1: The question asks about placing grapes just before moving through the checkout point. The question then suggests the possibility of the grapes being placed in the mouth, the grocery cart, the supermarket, the fruit basket, or the fruit market. \n2: The phrase 'just before' signifies the imminence of the checkout process. This can be assumed to mean 'prior' to the checkout process unless any other wording explicitly contradicts this. \n3: Given that this situation involves going through a checkout process at a supermarket, it can be safely assumed that the supermarket is the one containing the fruit basket. The grapes cannot be placed in the face(mouth) as it isn't possible to check out while still containing the item in your mouth. The fruit market will not have grapes in it, so that can also be ignored as an option. \n4: The remaining choice is C: supermarket.\n5: In summary, the correct answer is C: supermarket as it meets the constraints of the situation: the supermarket is the place just before the checkout point, it contains the fruit basket which the grapes can be placed in before leaving the premises, and the option of placement in the mouth is ruled out as the person cannot be engaged in the checkout process while still holding the grapes.\nSo the correct answer is C supermarket\n\nInput:What's a place you can't see but know it exists?

The term 'draw' is often associated with pull, attraction, magnetism, a sense of calling(ex. his room 'draws' him there), etc, which can also mean that he is often lured into that room and spends a lot of time there. \n5. All these clues together imply that the room he likes the most is the kitchen. \n6.

The last two options are not plausible because it's not like they will see a 'chicago' or 'capital city'.\n2: Since we have seen the other obvious answer options which were 'little italy,' we can safely eliminate them.\n3: Therefore, we will be looking for the correct answer. \n4: After the elimination of C: Little Italy, we see the best fitting option to be 'chicago'. \n5: This is because 'chicago' is a famous pizzeria chain in the U.S where people would go for a pizzeria treat while'shopping'.

The question is asking where they left'something' which could be assumed to be a can of food rather than a can of soup. Additionally, we could infer that left 'over' meant leftovers.\n2.: The rest of the choices make the incorrect, plausible options. The food for pets and paper towels were not needed.

Choices:  A. The bus ride B. A bus C. To ride D. Bus service E. To walk\nOutput: When I was young, I used to take a bus to the park, but now I walk.  A. The correct answer is A. The reason for walking to the park rather than taking a bus is because I am older therefore, walking is a preference for my age.  The bus is not necessarily more accessible as I can still use it but simply the walk is one I prefer to do.  B. A bus is not a preferred mode of transportation and therefore, it cannot be a reason for walking to the other end.  C. To ride is merely an action word and it cannot be the answer since it includes actions such as playing, eating, or talking.  D. Bus service has the same issue as A bus, as one can never just ride a bus service alone, it's an action word.  E.

The first choice, A: walk, is a part of a broader action referred to as \u201cwhat during the day\u201d here. The phrase \u201cwhat during the day,\u201d in general, refers to a part of daily routine or activities that are performed throughout the day.

The second choice, B: lay down, is referring to a resting position such as lying down or sitting down. Hence, it is not the right answer as it refers to resting not travelling or moving around.\n\n4. The third choice, C: working, is part of an activity or routine that is usually associated with daily work or tasks. However, we already know from the beginning of the sentence that this person chose to not continue with his daily routine. Hence, choice C: working would also be eliminated.\n\n5. The fourth choice, D: moving, as a verb, refers to traveling or moving from one location to another. In the context of the sentence, it is unlikely to mean to move to different part of the same location or to travel for short distances, but it's more likely that it refers to travelling between locations.

A verb is the action being performed, here in this case, it means expressing myself in a written form. So, our option needs to have a verb that fits this purpose. This means that an option that has a verb that is synonymous with 'to express oneself in a written form' should be the correct choice, since the clued phrase is 'to share something in my head I write an essay'. 3 The final answer therefore is B: write an essay.\nSo the final option is B: write an essentialy to avoid the second question\n\nInput: If we do nothing about climate change, how long will it take for Earth to overheat?

Since 'do nothing about climate change' is synonymous to 'do not make any effort to reduce carbon emissions', we can assume that the answer will be in the form of a number of years 'to do nothing' (syn. not making any effort), since we are evaluating the period for which climate change will get worse given a lack of action. 2. The first option indicates that global warming will be a result of only human intervention. Hence, it can be eliminated. 3. The second option indicates that global warmihg is a result of both natural and human interventions, so it has the possibility of correctness. 4. The third option indicates that global warmin is a result of only natural intervent,s since human interventions are not considered in its assessment. Given this information, only D: 16 years can be considered as having the same characteristics as the clue, since it states that global warming will get worse over 16 years due to only natural interventions. 5.

Looking at the options, we can see that A: stressful includes driving stressed(tensed), C: fun has nothing to do with the question asked. Hence, only options 'B: dangerous, D: illegal, E: deadly are options that can lead to accidents. \n3. B: dangerous includes reckless driving, so too can D: illegal. However, E: deadly involves getting into an accident, like a head-on collision, therefore is not the same thing as reckless driving.\n4. D: illegal is not driving but a type of driving that may lead to accidents. Therefore, D: illegal cannot be the most likely answer.\n5. To evaluate the other options, D: illegal could potentially lead to accidents, however, it does not specify how and only includes reckless driving as the factor that causes accidents in E: deadly. Hence D: illegal only works if it is combined with reckless driving, making B: dangerous a good alternative to D: illegal option.  B: dangerous has the inclusion of reckless driving, the main point of the question asked and therefore, is the best answer to the question, 'What kind of the driving leads most to accidnets?'

While a doctor's job is to provide medical care,'repair' is not a service but describes what may be done to keep something in working order. However, the question asks about someone paying for a service. \n4. A 'hospital' is a place. This means one would normally go to a 'hospital' instead of paying for a 'hospital'. \n5. Grocery stores sell food and other items to be consumed immediately. Therefore, it would be strange to pay for these", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

Choices: A. in the closet B. in the bathroom C. underneath a bedroom D. in the hallway E. inside the kitchen F. inside the living room\nOutput: \nThe question asks for the location of the largest wardrobe. From the options, we can eliminate the locations in the closet, bathroom and a bedroom, since those are the locations of a smaller wardrobe.\nFurther, it would be strange to put the wardrobe inside the kitchen or living room. Hence, the locations underneath a bed or inside a hallway are the only two locations that fit the bill.\nThe location under a bed is often the location of a dressing table or the smallest wardrobe, unlike the answer given, which indicates a larger wardrobe. Hence, C: in the hallway is the correct answer.\nSo the answer in the question is F: inside of the kitchen\n\nOutput: What is inside a shirt pocket? Choices: A: keys. B: small money C: small change D: small credit card E: small receipt F: nothing important at all\nThe question asks about what is inside the pocket of a shirt with a list of choices that follow. Each of the answer choices provided is valid. However, the choice of a small change, a small credit card, a small receipt, and or nothing important at all are the most likely choices to be found in such a pocket. Thus, the combination of two of these choices would be the most common response. Hence, for the shirt pocket, A: keys and B: small money is the most common response.", "answer": "E: neatness"}

Choices: 1. A: yes 2. B: no 3. C: sometimes 4. D: rarely 5. E: never\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking if something becoming dirty requires it to be washed, so option A: yes, is the only answer since there might be other causes of it becoming dirty that don't involve it being washed.\n2.) The second answer, B: no, can be ruled out because the question is asking about something becoming dirty in the first place, so if something doesn't become dirty, it doesn't need to be washed.\n3.) The third answer, C: sometimes, may at first seem like the correct answer, but upon further thought, considering the context given that anything that gets dirty must be washed, the correct answer is actually B: no since sometimes it isn't necessary to wash and dry things that have become dirty. \n4.)

{"text": "1: The question asks where to throw a rock into a river, and the options are: mountains, countryside, bridge, mountain range, and earth.\n2. The surface of the earth is not a specific place, but a more general concept. It would be less likely to throw something on a mountain range, but it is still a place where you can throw something. Therefore, it is not a suitable choice.\n3. The mountains and countryside are locations of a more general kind, but not specific enough places for the question at hand.\n4. A bridge is something you would cross to get to a river, but it is not exactly the river itself, so it is also not a suitable choice. \n5. Hence, the correct answer is D: mountain range as it's a general location that allows for throwing a rock into a river.\nSo the final answers is D: mountain range.\n\nInput:Where can you learn music in an instrument?

Ignoring this scenario is not a good solution since it can lead to the person not answering at all or, at worst, giving a wrong answer.\n3. By looking nervous, one risks making the question-asker misunderstand the person being asked which may not be the correct answer.\n4.

Hence, ''metro station'' is not a valid answer.\n5-The ''fairgrounds'' do not contain any sporting events but are for events like crafts and art shows which are held at the fair. Hence the ''fairgrounds' are also excluded. \n6-Finally, the ''amusement park'' is defined as an organized collection of rides or attractions for public entertainment, typically operated for profit.

This is the tricky part:\n4) There are two options: D: small  and E: terrible. \n5)'small' could refer to a quantity of decorations, the amount of decorations, the size of the decorations, or the cost per decoration(it costs very little per decoration). \n6) 'tough' is not a location and doesn't make sense to be used.\n7) The decoration is for halloween and the decoration had been made smaller so it wasn't as scary, yet they did a good job. 'completely terrible' or 'horrible' would not make sense; therefore, the sentence reads as follows: \n8) They had completely done a good job because they did a good job with scary decorations by making them little(the size of the decorations).\n9) Hence, the sentence is 8. The decorations are completely good, and that's why 'completely a certain type of halloween decoration' would imply that they're terribly bad and that's not correct. \n10) Therefore, there were only two options: D:small- the decorations were small, and E: terrible- The decorations are terrible.\n11) But the sentence is 8, so D should be eliminated.\n12) The last option, E- terrible is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are A,E: They had done a great job by making them completely terrible, or terrible.\n\nInput: He is a real hero by saving people during the flooding.

Choices:  A. meat B. vegetables C. fruits D. pasta E. nuts\nOutput: 1 - If you have meat, it was a meat-related product that you're eating. However, the vegetables and fruits options are not food but plant products, therefore those options are eliminated. \n2- If you had pasta, it would be eaten from a plate, but that doesn't really make sense and is most likely not an option. Plus, pasta isn't served a a dinner plate, so pasta should be eliminated. \n3- From the remaining options, we can rule out fruits since it doesn't make sense to eat the fruit from a plate. The correct answer therefore is A: meat. \nSo the answer is: A: meat", "answer": "E: feelings"}

{"text": "1) The question asks about something James needed a garage for. A garage provides a place for storing vehicles (and other things) like cars, trucks, motorbikes, etc. Thus, option C: building is the appropriate choice\n2) Option B: downtown refers to a city center, hence is not a place of interest here since the question asks about a place to store vehicles. B: downtown, is therefore eliminated, leaving four options remaining\n3) Options A: bikes and D: tool storage can be eliminated immediately because option A would be irrelevant in this context since we're not looking for somewhere to store bikes. Also, option D: tools implies a similar thing but with tools instead of cars and, as a result, option A remains.\n4) Option E: car is an obvious choice here since it's an automatic choice for garages.

Choices: 1. Look at cactus garden\n2. Eat at the buffet\n3. Go to bathroom\n4. Watch seals\n5. Visit the primates\nOutput: 1) The zoo may exhibit a wide range of wildlife, including kangaroos. However, it is important to note that the question specifically asks about a way to avoid the kangaroo exhibit, not simply to avoid being in the zoo. So we can eliminate the answer choice that involves the zoo as a whole as an answer.\n2) The other options do not really address or provide a solution to the question at hand. A visit to the cactus garden will offer no help in dodging the kangaroo.\n3) The choice, to go to the bathroom, has a reasonable explanation but it is still unlikely that it would be a viable solution for avoiding the kangaroos. Therefore the answer is incorrect.\n4) Similarly, visiting the seals may seem appropriate, the same argument for it is not a realistic solution to the problem. \n5) If one avoids the kangaroo, then it is unlikely they will be required to watch any primates. This is why the answer choice involving the primates as an avoidance strategy is invalid.\nSo on the basis of above we can eliminate all answer choice expect A) Look at cactus gardens.\nTherefore the final answer is A: Look at cactus Garden\n\nInput: Where", "answer": "E: embarrassment"}

The first possibility is incorrect as a gift is given regardless of there being a celebration or not.\n2.) The second possibility is incorrect as a celebration does not need to be prevented.\n3.) The third possibility is incorrect as a personal gift is not intended to gain attention from a celebrity, but to express your love to your loved one. Similarly, the fourth possibility is incorrect as it is not a personal gift but an award offered to a celebrity due to their contribution to a cause or effort. \n4.) As such, the remaining possibilities are D and E.\n5.) The question hints towards an indication to express one's love, giving us two options of D and E. Though, there is a plausible possibility, B, which could be a gift for a celebration where it serves as a gesture to celebrate the important day. \n6.)

{"text": "1 This question is asking about the most likely feeling of the husband if his wife asks him to stop being married to/with her.  \n2 To determine the answer, we first check the definitions of the emotions given in the choices.  \n3 'Happiness', 'pleasure', and 'happy' all mean the same: feelings of joy(usually temporary).  \n4 'Grief' and 'grief' also mean the same but rather a feeling of sadness after the loss of a loved one, usually caused by a painful event. So it cannot be either of these.  \n5 'Feeling of isolation' suggests a feeling of loneliness. So, this option is not the correct answer either.  \n6 'Being married' can mean many things: getting married, being married, staying married, staying married with someone, etc. In addition, the question states \"with her\", further indicating that the marriage is currently ongoing. Hence, it is most likely that the feelings of the husband will have to do with the ongoing marriage.  \n7 Therefore, the correct answer is 'feeling of being with her' (the only option left for 'being married'). This means that in light of an ongoing marriage, if his wife asks him suddenly to stop being with her, she would hurt him, so the most likely feeling is disappointment with friends, as they represent the most positive thing in his life since wife can also be a disappointment.  \n8 However, this does not mean that 'feeling of grief' is not true, but rather, it is possible that he would feel both feelings together, and if it is only one of these feelings, it must not be 'feeling with her'.\nSo the final answer in this case is B: disappointment\nInput: Why are we not allowed to touch the cash at the grocery?

And if we don't touch our cash, how are we going to pay for goods at the grocery store", "answer": "D: grief"}

By reading and interpreting the hint, we note that this person is unwilling to learn even if the task is made interesting, important or fun. \n2. Since the person isn't particularly interested in learning, they wouldn't mind if the process was less demanding and less time consuming. That is, it would be better to make it less challenging and more casual, or something more to the point. \n3. Since the question refers to some sort of education or learning activity, and the person wants it to be easier, simpler and less time consuming, it can only be a process that's already existing in schools or universities, e.g. taking tests or exams. \n4. The first 2 options do not refer to any pre-determined academic process so they can be eliminated. \n5. As far as the remaining 3 options, while they are related to learning and education, they're actually referring to the type of the education or the atmosphere related to it. So they're not necessarily preferred by someone who doesn't like learning. \n6. The last 2 options, C and E, refer to the type of the atmosphere. A person would prefer either something more joyous or one that was free from stress or pressure. And both of these options rely on the person's emotional well-being rather than his/her willingness to learn.\n7.

One of the ways in which adults entertain children is through storytelling. Since adults aren't children, a story is interesting to them. 3. All other answer choices involve places where children would naturally want to go. 4. One might initially be tempted to pick the fourth answer, as children don't want to attend adult functions like dinners or go to adult-oriented places like toy stores. However, this answer choice is incorrect because these are situations in which children are often invited along anyway. In addition, the last answer choice, 'dinner' can be confusing since it doesn't specify that the dining experience is for children. It's possible the question is intended to assess people's understanding of the expression 'dinner for children' as a child-friendly meal. In this case, a child-friendly dinner may be a type of dinner that is appropriate for children to attend, but it's not the answer to this question since it's not a 'place' that children wouldn't find interesting. 5.

However, travel to a different country doesn't require a ticket only for entry into a stadium. Hence, this option cannot be the correct answer. \n6.

Choices:  Choices: A: yes B: no C: definitely D: maybe E: maybe not\nOutput: 1 No, we can't take away grown up to understand that the children won't be able to go to the playground.\n\n2. The first two options, A: yes and C: definitely, are obvious and out of scope.\n\n3. We must eliminate the answer choice A: yes. If the answer is yes, then the question would instead be, \u2018Can grown-ups go to the playground with their children?\u2019 which doesn't make grammatical sense at all.\n\n4. The third and fourth choice, D: maybe and E: maybe not, could possibly seem like the correct answer. But what exactly does this choice mean? Does it mean that grown-ups might be able to go to playground with their children due to maybe circumstances or they can\u2019t because of maybe circumstances?\n\n5. To fully understand what \u2018maybe\u2019 in the question means, think about it this way: The question asks whether the children can go to playground without a grown-up. If the answer is maybe, then it is possible that they might be able to without a grown-up, but it is also possible that they cannot.\n\n6. The final answer choice, B: no, stands out as a clear possibility as it is the only option that offers definite clarity regarding the situation presented in the question. \n\nSo the final answers B: no\n\nInput: Can we open an invitation?

{"text": "1: The phrase 'go forth' has positive connotations, as in 'to move forward or ahead'. 'This' can be taken to refer back to 'go forward' to mean a continuance of the action rather than the reverse. Thus we can discard option B: backwards as its inversed meaning. \n2. Option D: back and tally-back may at first seem like the most appropriate option, having both a similar structure as forward(D: back and) and being a contradictory of it, but the use of the term 'tally back' isn't specific enough, it could refer to a count of anything or a recount, as in \"tallying back\". Hence, D: back and must be discarded as D: back and means to move backwards. \n3. Option C: back and could at first seem like the correct choice with its reference to going back. However, it is a synonym of D: back and, and thus excluded. \n4. Options A: reverse and E: tally-back could also seem like plausible answer choices with their uses of the the synonym back. However, both use the similar structure to move forward(A: reverse/E: tally-back) rather than back, as the saying implies. \n5. Option B: backwards is still another possibility, but it must be discarded as an answer choice for the same reason above(D: back and). \n6. That leaves us with two options: A: reverse and B: reverse. A: reverse is a popular slang way to express 'go backward'. B: reverse, however, doesn't make any sense in the given context as it means 'go backward' AND'make an opposite' OR 'do the exact opposite to'. It's evident from the phrase \"was to go forward also this\" which indicates an attempt to describe a positive action as two contrasting positive actions. Hence B: reverse, even though it seems plausible at first, is excluded as an answer choice, since it contradicts the idea that goes backward can possibly be a positive. \n7. Thus, option A: reverse is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are A: reverse, D: back and\n\nInput: The two types of books that we love the most are hardcover and paperback.

{"text": "1) 'Lindy' is a boy. \n2) The term 'where' in the question is a prepositional question, which implies that it would take a place as an answer. \n3) The question then asks us about the place Lindy would not go to. \n4) There are many places to which Lindy can go. He can go to offices, old people's homes, parks, etc. \n5) However, the choice only lists a couple of those. \n6) Since Lindy would only go to places like old people's homes and college, he can not go to offices. \n7) Furthermore, because Lindy is a child, he most likely goes to a school or a park (as old people and college do not fit the bill). \n8) Since he does not go to either school or park, he can only go to an old people's homes or a college. \n9) However, if Lindy's age is not specified as 'in his senior years' or 'old', then he most likely goes to offices, which would disqualify all the other places of going. So, even though Lindy lives with his children after he is married, he does not prefer his children's company. He wants to go to park or college, if he is young. \n10) So, since no other place but a \"park'or college\" makes sense at this point, only Park or College is an answer. \n11) However, in general, \"college\" sounds like a place that Lindy is not going to. Therefore, the correct answer is \"Park.\"\nSo the final answer park\n\nInput:What is the name of this type?\n1) Choices:  A. the man with the black umbrella B. a black umbrella C. black D. with the black\n2)Output:A.

{"text": "1.'Why might a person go' indicates that there are reasons one would go and the question is asking the rationale why one might do that. \n2. There are different reasons one might go to get counsel. \n3. Based on that, the answer is either because one may have been offered counseling or they need counseling or want it for different reasons. \n4. Answer choices A, B, and C are not suitable as they are phrased in negative forms (to not be heard, not to receive gifts, and not to understand themselves). These mean that people don;t go for the reasons listed or do things specifically to avoid or not receive them.\n5 answer choice D is also not an adequate answer because it does not explain why one might go to get the 'good things in life'(which is not offered or available through counselling); rather, it is indicating something that a person may receive or be provided with as they go for counselling. \n6. The final answer options, A: to be heard, and B: receive gifts, could plausibly be answers that a person may receive as a result of getting counselling. 7.

Choices: 1) A: In a dog house 2) B: In a chicken house 3) C: In a horse house 4) D: In a cage 5) E: On a farm\nOutput:The question is about a rabbit in a cage on a farm. Firstly, we consider all cages as options.\n1. The term dog house defines caged animals, as it is where dogs are brought to stay when outside their owners\u2019 home. So dog house is an option.\n2. The term chicken house implies a cage where chickens are kept. So, chicken house is an option. \n3. The term horse house has no relation to being kept in a cage. So it is removed.\n4. The term cage is a literal interpretation of the question and hence, option 4 is to be kept in a cage on the farm.\n5. The term a farm has been mentioned in the question as a location where the rabbit could live. Hence, there is no significance if the rabbit lives on a farm or not.\n\nCombining all the above and evaluating all the options together, the rabbit in a caged could be living on the farm, either in the dog house or the chicken house or the cage. All the options except for the cage, do not make any sense.\n\n1. Hence, the correct", "answer": "E: may laugh"}

Similarly, options B: raise, D: build, and E: fix cannot be correct answer choices as the sequence of actions would have to start with either B: raise, D.build, or E: fix before starting with A: make.\n5.

The other choices are incorrect since they are untrue or illogical (a gentleman living in the men's room is an unlikely situation). \n4. Since, we do not know if he lives in a palace or a big house, both options are viable. \n5. In the choice 'a big house', the adjective 'big' is used to describe the house and the house is living but not a person, which means it does not fit the context. \n6. In the choice \"a palace\", the adjective 'big', is used to compare the house and the house being compared is the palace, which means palace is bigger than house. \n7. Thus, the correct choice can only be \"a palace\". So the correct answer is A: palace", "answer": "B: big house"}

Hence, the place where clothes are made could be a tailor shop(option A: tailor shop), or a clothing store(option C: clothing store).\n4) However, clothing stores usually don't make the clothes sold.\n5) Therefore, tailor shops are a more likely location where someone, in this case someone who made something, may get a bag.\n6) Hence, the correct answer is A: tailor shop, where tailors would get a bag to store clothes.\nSo the final and only answer is A: tailors", "answer": "C: shopping mall"}

Also,'surface of earth', does not fit the context as almost all cannot live on earth's'surface' or its'surface of earth'. Further, when the words, 'all people' in the context 'all people' reside in an apartment, it can be inferred that option,'surface of Earth', is out of context. Hence,'surface of the Earth' is also eliminated as an option in the question.\n5th: When the words 'almost all people live' are combined with the context of the'residency' of 'apartment' 'inhabitants', it can be inferred there is only one option that 'all' 'people' 'live'in' which would be 'a car show'. Therefore, option 'd' is the best answer.\nSo the final answered is D: car show\n\n# [5] \ud83c\udfaf\ud83e\udde0\n\n# Multiple Choice Question:", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

There are only 2 possible combinations that satisfy the above-mentioned conditions: (a) a container, a rose bush.(b) a rose bush, a container\n\n6. This leaves us with only containers and rose bushing to choose from.\n7. So the correct answer is B garden center since it is the best place for someone looking to buy or rent a container for their rose bush.\nSo the final is B: garden center\n\n### Instruction:\n\nInput: Where would you find a snake? Choices: A: water B: field C: forest D: cave E: rock\nOutput: The question asks where a person can find a snake. We should consider what types of places could contain a snake, as it would not be possible to see a small snake in a field or a cave if the person is standing on top of the field or on the outskirts of the cave.\n\nA snake is found on land and it cannot live underwater, so the person cannot find a snake while wandering around in the water.\nA cave could be a natural place where snakes might live, but it would be harder for a person to spot a snake there. The forest is the most plausible option since in real life, one could spot a snake while hiking in the woods or visiting a zoo. Thus, the correct place is (D) Forest. \n\n### Instructions:\n\nInput:Where might you find a horse? Choices: A. Water B. Field C. Forest D. Garden E. Cave\nOutput: We know that a horse is an animal that lives on land.\nHence it is not possible to find the horse in water. It is also not possible to find a horse in the forest.\nIn the field, the possibilities are more. The possibilities of finding the horse are more in the garden than with the field. So, we can narrow it down to garden. \n\n## 12.\n\n![](../assets/images/problem_images/12.png", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

If you're interested in buying something but unfortunately it is already sold, one needs more money (and time) to buy it again from the person who first sold it. \n2.Credit is not required because you will have already bought the item by the time you are trying to buy it again. \n3.'Time' - there is no time limit on you being able to buy the same thing again. \n4.'Money' - You only need more money if you can't buy that particular object in the first place.\n5.'More money' - You are already trying to buy the object in the first place, so already have the money needed for it.\n6.'Work' - Unless someone was 'working' on the previous buy, there is little or no work required\nSo the final answer in this question is E: work\n\n\nInput: When are you driving a bus?

However, a vote might affect society, but as it occurs in the democracy, it is not a violent conflict.\n3. In addition, an understanding is to identify what problem is the main issue that the society is suffering on.\n4. An action is not an agreement for discussion the problem in the society.\n5. A revolution is aimed at killing people and it may not be a solution for a peaceful society. This fact must be considered as well.\n6. Thus, the only option that may be used in order to change society is an action.\n7.  A violent conflict does not refer to a person's point of view as a violent conflict needs to be a violent conflict and it cannot be a civil conflict since it is a conflict between people, not two different parties, but two different countries.\n8.

However, the veldt is not relevant here since lions do not typically live on it. \n4. However, the second option, B: ocean, appears to fit, as oceans are found all over the world and lions are found in many different regions. However, since the ocean has been ruled out as a possible place that lions live, we can eliminate it. \n5. The third option,C: savannah, is a savannah is a large, rolling plain, and lions are commonly found in such areas. Hence, the choice seems relevant. However, as the question has already excluded B: ocean as an option, we know that D: africa is not the answer since Africa is not a place where lions are likely to live. \n6. Now, as D: africa is ruled out, we must look at the remaining choices. The fourth option E: jungle appears to be a possible answer since lions are commonly found there. However, the fifth and final option E: jungles is a plural for jungle or junglee and since a singular is preferred in the question, we can only eliminate it. \n7.

A sporting goods store is the most likely to have sports equipment, including equipment required for recreational activities or sports championships.\nSo the final answers are E: sporting goods\n\n\n\n\nInput: When are most participants likely to need sporting equipment? Choices: A: during a mall  B: during an event  C: in a store  D: during a shop event  E: sports event\nOutput:  The correct answer will be sporting event.", "answer": "B: sporting event"}
{"text": "The question requires us to identify what the mother places the wrapping paper of the last gift she wrapped under.\n\n1.The first option is A: department store, which is incorrect because they don't sell wrapping paper products.\n\n2. The second choice, B: fancier fur is not relevant since they do not wrap gifts.\n\n3. The third option, D: christmas tree, does not make any sense because \"the mother\" is the gift-wrapping person, not the one who put the tree up.\n\n4. The fourth option, E: christmas stockings, is not relevant to the context of the question. Furthermore, a Christmas stocking is usually hung on the fireplace or over a door, not placed under anything.\n\n5. After analyzing all the information, the one that best fits the context is C: specialty store. A specialty store is a type of retail outlet that sells specifically designed or specialized products. Since wrapping paper is considered a specialized product, this makes D: christmas tree wrong. Likewise, E: christmas stuffing cannot be correct because wrapping paper is not considered a type of wrapping item.\n\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is C:specialty store.\n\nSo the final answer for the above question is C:specialty shop\n\nInput: My friend bought me a what for Christmas as an act of kindness to cheer me up?

{"text": "1: As per the context, it is important that the cabin was small and hence unavailable, which means that the options A: villa, C: hall, D: palace, E: hotel are all eliminated as these would not be the smaller options.\n2: Choice B: spacecraft cannot be the answer as the options are limited to cabin, hall, palace, hotel.\n3: This leaves us with cabins and B: spacecraft is thus eliminated.\n4: Choice E: hotel may seem like the most natural fit, however space craft is also a type of aircraft, which is related to the cabin and thus can also be counted as a type of aircraft. Additionally, A: villa becomes the next most plausible answer.\n5: Finally, given the information, Choice B: space craft is the closest in meaning to a space craft.

Choices:  S: Cash  T: Credit card U: Debit card V: Gift card  B: Check W: Paypal\nOutput: 1:'Cash' is money and thus invalid payment option. C: Credit card,D: Debit card are indeed payment options. \n2: The second option is A: Check. A check is a draft of a payment of money and is hence not a form of payment. It cannot be used as valid payment option.\n3: T: Credit card is not a valid payment option when considering the answer choice.\n4: V: Gift card is a payment option.\n5: U: Debit card is a payment option\n6: Hence B: Check and V: Gift card are rejected as choice for answer. \n7: So, the only valid payment options are C: Credit card and D: Debit card.

This means we can eliminate C: college room.\n3. 'College kids', not 'college kid' means that more than one person can fit, which would mean using the plural 'apartments' instead of singular 'apartment' \n4.

The term `social activism' suggests that one must act within society on behalf of a group or cause if there is to be change in society.

The first option, `riots', refers to violent disruptive activities which do not seem like the kind of activity that will bring about societal changes. Hence we can eliminate it. \n4. The second option, `vote', refers to casting choices in elections to gain certain control over power which seems like the kind of systemic activity that is required to be carried out on behalf of a cause to bring about the change desired. This is a plausible answer but still needs to be evaluated against the other options. \n5. The third option, `change yourself', implies that one should be the person to change and bring about the desired societal change from within a group due to one's own efforts. This is not likely to be the answer and hence should be eliminated.\n6. The fourth option, `change clothes', is unlikely to achieve social change. If one's sole goal was to change society and make changes then it would probably be better to wear clothing that is more in sync with a certain cause rather than trying to change society directly. \n7.

{"text": "1) After reading the question, one can conclude that it asks about Southern institutions in which slaves perform labor.\n2) The term 'institution' refers to an arrangement or plan for doing something. In a similar way, the  'plantation' is a large agricultural property where a chief produces agricultural products like cotton, etc. Slaves are used in the plantation to perform labors. Hence, the term 'plantation' can qualify as an institution where slaves perform labor.\n3) The term 'ancient rome' has nothing to do with plantations and slavery, hence, this choice is eliminated.\n4) The term 'history book' may also be eliminated since it relates to books and not plantations, hence not qualifying as an institution where slaves do labor.\n5) The term 'poor countries' is not an institution as well, hence, this choice too is eliminated.\n6) Hence, we end up finding that the final answer is E 'plantation'.\nSo the final answer Planteation\n\nInput: What can cause damage to a ship? Choices: 1. A: sledgehammors 2. B: volcanoes 3. C: metoroids 4. D: lightning 5. E: tornadoes\nOutput: 1:  The word'ship' refers to a boat/vessel that can be used for travelling.\n2:  The word'meteoroid' is a piece of rock and metal in space, which is not related to ships. Hence, this can be eliminated.\n3:'meteoroid' also refers to a mass of particles, which is again not related to a ship.\n4: The word 'lightning' may be associated with ships, but is generally used to signify electric lightning, which is not related here as the word 'lightning' has never appeared in the question.\n5: The word 'tornadoe' is not a ship and hence not suitable.\nThus we are left with only option C  where a meteoroid may cause damage to a ship.\nSo the final answe is C: Meteoroids\n\nInput: What is the purpose of a tarp?

{"text": "1.. The question asks about the primary duty of a parent. \n2. One would be hard pressed to find a parent who is not in the happiness of their children and also takes care of them. Hence A: speak freely and B: happiness of a\nchild are both reasonable options. \n3. However, there are two key things to remember when analyzing A and B. \n4. If you choose option A: speak freely, it means that the primary duty of the parent is \"to speak freely\" which doesn't seem to make much sense. \n5. Likewise, if you choose option B: happiness of a, it doesn't tell the reader(parent) what their primary duty is, it just states it. \n6. Also, D: control children, which refers to a parent(s) \"control\" or care\" a child isn't a reasonable option for a primary duty because parents are supposed to take care of their children, not control them. \n7. Furthering this logic, E: School children, means having responsibility for a child who attends school and are under school supervision. \n8. Even though E: School children would be an option for a primary duty since it involves taking care of a child, it isn't the parent's primary duty as they are already school children, and it's up to schools to \"control\" or \"care\" for them. \n9. This means that parents do take care of their children by providing for them, which relates to both A: speak freely(providing for them) and B: happiness of children(taking care of them). Hence, A and B are a good choice. \n10. However, we can't overlook how well B does fit this question and so it stands as the better choice. \n11.

{"text": "1)The question asks for the location where a graveyard would be built. \n2)A 'graveyard' is any of many places where the bodies of people are buried. As such, an option such as arlington, which is the name of a battleground where U.S. soldiers died in the Civil War, doesn't really make sense as a location.\n3)Similarly, a 'church property' is the property that churches use, which could include anything from church buildings to the parking lots around those buildings. A church cemetery is not an essential part of church property, so it's also not necessarily indicative of where a graveyard should be built.\n4)It's fairly safe to assume that 'out back' refers to the area around someone's home that can be used for various purposes and could potentially include the area where a cemetery would be built. As such, it's possible to eliminate D: every town as a potential answer.\n5)Option E: cemetery is the only option remaining that includes the words 'cemetery' and 'graveyard' as well as other features that make it possible to correctly determine a specific location. The term 'cemetery' refers to an area where people are buried, while 'graveyard,' as mentioned above, is a generic term that includes this in its definition. As such, both terms can be used interchangeably. So, for the correct answer, it's possible that a graveyard would not be just anywhere but would be built specifically in C: every town's cemetery.\nSo the final answers are C: every town' what it means is the name of town and C: every town' is the location.\n\n\n\n```python\ndef read():\n    lines=get_lines()\n    question_line=lines[0]\n    #print(question_line)\n    #print(lines)\n    lines=get1(\"The graveyard was.....................

This word choice could indicate an improvement in mood or state of being from feeling exhausted.\n8) Combining the information above, the correct answer seems to be E: feel better, as it seems to be the appropriate word form after reading the sentence.\nSo the final answers are E: feel better\n\nOutput: How are we if we are driving into town and need gas?

Choices:  J: applied hot wet towel W: removed staple from it H: put ice pack on it M: gave it ice C: used hot towel\nOutput: 1) J: Applying hot wet towel could reduce any swelling, inflammation or burning sensation. It's plausible that a sore wrist would apply hot wet towel \n2) Removing staple: The body can react to a staple by trying to push it back out. If the staple has been removed, the body may not need to try to keep the staple back in, thereby reducing swelling for the sore wrist. Could be an explanation.\n3) Hot towel: It's plausibly that a sore wirst could have a towel on it or near it, to keep it as toasty on the sore wrist as possible.\n4) Ice pack: A sore wrist could potentially cool itself with the use of an ice pack. So it's plausible.\n5) Gave it ice: A sore wirst could potentially have some ice on it or near it to keep it feeling cooler or reduce burning.

There are four options: A: board a ship, B: shout at/across a room, C: smile at, D: cross a street or feel happy. \n3. Boarding a ship is not a place and therefore, not an option. \n4.

Smiling at someone from across a room can sometimes draw attention but as mentioned above, it's not always guaranteed and may lead to other difficulties. \n6. Crossing a street in any direction won't necessarily make a person look at you. Moreover, this option doesn't indicate that they're in a room, where the question specifically asks. \n7. Feeling happy is not a direct method to draw another person's attention(e.g. by raising energy levels). \n8.

This is a pun in which the \"card players\" are actually fish because \"shallow waters\" is a place where they are very easy to catch. For example, fishermen go to the \"backwaters\" to catch them, but they like to catch the \"big ones\" in \"deep waters\".\nThe fourth choice is \"D: poker game\" because poker is one of the most well known games where players sit and count cards. Even though they might do it for a large amount of cards, they are only \"staking their all on one card\". Poker card rooms are very \"hot\" places so people take breaks for smoke and drinks. Because they want \"poker eyes\", they like the light to be \"right\" to help them read the cards' faces, even though they should be \"lights out\".\nThe fifth choice is \"E: card shark\" because card sharks are very tricky with card counting and like to use \"the art of bluffing\" to fool their opponents.

Garage. - Department stores are general merchandise stores that sell a wide variety of products at high prices. - Discount stores, like stores such as Walmart or Home Depot, sell products at lower prices than department stores.  - Thrift stores, like Goodwill or charity resale stores, sell used or gently used products at low or \"no\" cost. - Garage sales are private sales, in which an individual or family sells their unwanted items, products, or collectibles.  - Garages are used to store cars. So a 'garage' sale, in this sense, can be considered a 'low-cost' good deal, since it is a private sale where people sell things that they don't use, or don't want.  \nThus, based on the above information, the choices which make a good deal are 'thrift store' and 'garage sale'. - The 'best' good deal is a very subjective matter, dependent on how badly one wants/needs the said good. Thus, I will leave this answer blank.\n\nInput: Which fruit could be used for baking", "answer": "A: math book"}

The question has made it clear that the context is about a person who is in a room alone without anyone's presence and all other options are possible. \n2.) Since option (5) refers to something that can be done, it can thus be further narrowed down to actionable options. \n3.) Option (1) refers to asking for help. However, doing nothing is an option in this scenario.  Option (1) thus cancels out.  Likewise, option (2) refers to the act of waiting. However, just thinking and doing something are also options.

B: cemetary is also incorrect as it does not apply to the general population and is instead focused on a specific type of individuals.\n6. A: construction site might be a location where excavation sometimes happens, but not every time.\n7.

Also, the word 'above' is already used in comparison to'skills' so it cannot be used again while talking about 'the position'.\n6-'Higher position' fits well because it is not associated with speed. However, it may get mixed up with 'position' in the answer that is 'the position of higher position'.\n7- 'Skill' is related to performance as the question talks about 'competiton'. If the context is related to performance then it is 'advantage' but if it is related to relative positioning it is'superiority'.\n\n8-'Skill' has 2 forms - adjective and noun. Adjective is superior but its context requires noun form as used in'skill in performance'. \n9-After comprehension of #7, it leads to'superiority' as compared to others.\n10-'Determination' and 'the upper hand' are inappapropriate as per question description because of being an adjective and not a noun form.

Hence we need to eliminate this from the list of possible answers.\n3) Compliments is also eliminated, since we don't know if the person would receive compliments or not. Also, compliments is not necessarily the reason why a lot of people would surround someone. \n4) Popularity is also eliminated, as although a lot of people may approach a popular person on social media, this doesn't necessarily mean that they do approach a lot of people. \n5) Being understood is not the reason why a lot will approach a person, since being understood is a skill that can be learnt gradually and cannot be associated directly with the person's identity (i.e. they're not born with it or something). Hence we can eliminate it. \n6) Now, what does understanding oneself have in common with a lot of people approaching? One is likely to be understood (maybe) only because they understand themselves. Hence if you had to choose between a lot of people approaching, and understanding themselves, it would be pretty obvious. \n7) Moreover, the only answer we have left is care about, which can only be eliminated when we compare all the available choices in the list with the question's hint. \n8) From this, we can conclude that the correct answer is A: care about.\n\nSo the final answer will be A: care about", "answer": "D: popularity"}
{"text": "1.'Satisfied' being an adjective will always describe a noun. So the word 'person' being the noun should be considered. \n2. Since the context demands someone to feel happy or satisfied, it's safe to assume that it might be a place where a satisfied person can be.\n3. One would certainly like to be happy, and thus, feel satisfied. \n4. Hence, one can board a ship, go shopping, cross the street, or feel happy or satisfied. \n5. However, feeling happy or satisfied is sufficient alone to answer the question and hence, one cannot shout at them. \n6. We hence eliminate 'A', 'E', and 'D'. \n7. Since 'B' implies one can board a ship and go grocery shopping, but only 'C' stands out as the only location where one can cross the street.\n8. If one is boarding a ship or going grocery shopping or crossing the street, they would generally feel happy, hence making the context redundant.\n9.

Hence, 'police' or 'bartender' will not be possible answers to the question. 3.The 'Chief' may be the answer as in a police station, a police chief might be on duty. 4.In addition, a 'police officer', who is often called a patrolman or a watchman, is a person that stands guard and does not necessarily have to belong to law enforcement.\n5.It is thus reasonable to assume that a 'police station' is either a place where a 'patrolman' patrols, or a place where law enforcement agents perform administrative duties as well as patrol, or it's a place where a 'watchman' stands at the door and keeps an", "answer": "D: feel happy"}

Therefore, it should be possible to find a word that defines grouping of fishes.\nThe first option, A: pets does not group fishes together, so we can eliminate that.  \nThe second option, B: fills the ponds and the third option, C: attempt to fly are not suitable as the question doesn't ask 'do what?' rather 'get grades', which is usually related to students so we can eliminate them.  \nThe last option, D: school together, can be considered as fishes do gather, but it's not specified that they get grades or sit in desks as mentioned in the question, so we can eliminate.  \nHence, we can determine that fish school together can be an answer to the question.\nSo the final option here is E: breath in water which denotes the fact that the fishes breathe in water which gives them a way to communicate with each other.", "answer": "D: school together"}
{"text": "The question asks a person who's interested in finding some airplanes that aren't currently in use as aircrafts. \n1. Hence, these airplanes would probably have been decommissioned as not fit for use in modern wars. \n2. A 'war' and an 'aircraft carrier' as locations are, obviously, unfit for this purpose. \n3. 'Graveyard' and 'crash' are both unlikely locations where aircrafts would be kept for safekeeping or inspection. Most airplanes crash for one reason or another, or are sold out or dismantled. \n4. Thus, B: aircraft carrier and E: crash cannot be correct answers. \n5. The question states 'not being used as aircrafts', which implies that these airplanes could still be used in some other way than usual. They could possibly be used by the government or military, for instance, to fly spies or perform test flights for future upgrades. \n6. Another reason could be due to an unreasonably high price for such aircrafts and the market for military planes is a pretty small one with a handful of serious bidders, so it's unlikely for people to get these off-the-market jets for a low cost. A'market' is an unsuitable option to keep decommissioned aircrafts from wartime.\n7. Thus, the likeliest option would be C: sky. Airplanes typically take off and land from the air, so it makes a lot of sense to keep them there for safekeeping.\n8. 'Sky' is the likeliest option given the information above, and the fact that the question was very specific in the way it phrased the question. The correct answer is C: sky.\nSo the final conclusion is C: sky\n\nInput: If one is playing a musical instrument, which object is between them?

This word can be eliminated because it is not the correct word since, from the context, beer itself is not harmful to human health, so it wouldn't fit with that meaning, as it would be unrepresentative. \n4 The word D: intoxicating means'stimulated by the consumption of alcohol to the point of being drunk.'

Choices: A: shower B: wake up C: wake up and shower D E: dress\nOutput: 1 The given question says, 'What was the first thing you do in the morning, that is to say, wake up,' so A: shower must be eliminated because showering is a non-necessary activity that one often does in the morning. \n2 The given statement 'In the beginning, what was...' indicates that 'you' woke up and that this specific event is what the question is referring to, so B: wake up is the appropriate answer. \n3 C: Wake up and shower does not match the first sentence and wake up is the correct answer. \n4 D: dress makes no sense since wake up is the important aspect of the statement 'In the beginning,' and dress does not match the first statement, so it must also be eliminated.\n5 E: dress is the incorrect option because dressing has nothing to do with what you did in the first sentence and is mentioned as unnecessary, so the only appropriate option is B: wake up. \nSo finally, the", "answer": "E: harmful"}
{"text": "1)The question asks about the place where a beaver leaves.\n2)Because the word 'leaves' is in the present tense, in which the verb 'leaves' refers to action in progress, one beaver cannot leave many places, but must leave one place. The implication is that a beaver must leave a specific area to go from one location to another. \n3)Eliminating D: british colmbia: 1)british columbia is a geographic location, not a place and therefore not a suitable answer for the problem. 2)British columbia cannot apply to the question because the question already provided a plausible location of its beaver, \"the ocean\".\n4)Eliminating E: zoo: 1) Zoo implies that there is an enclosure in which a beaver lives.  This is also referred to as \"caged\".  A caged beaver cannot leave its confinement, so it is incorrect to say that \"a beaver\" leaves \"the zoo\". \n5)Eliminating C: body of water: 1)Body of water implies that there is a body of water where a beaver lives. This is also referred to \"caged\" or \"enclosed\".  A caged or enclosed beaver cannot leave its aquatic confinement, so a beaver cannot leave its body of water because they are caged. \n6)Eliminating A: wooded area: 1)Wooded area does not provide any location to which a beaver can leave from, and is therefore unsuitable.\n7)Eliminating B: the ocean: 1)the ocean implies that the beaver is going for a swim.

{"text": "1: The question asks about an object you do not need. \n2: A: If you do not need something (be it a person, place, or thing), you are still generally satisfied with it. So, you do not perceive it as something you do not need, hence, you cannot describe it as 'unnecessary'. Therefore, we can eliminate 'unnecessary' as this option does not provide an accurate description of something which has been described as not needing to be present. \n3: B: If the object doesn't need to be present, it means it is not required to function and, hence, it becomes superfluous.\n4: Since'superfluous' means there's no requirement for it in place or function, it can be interpreted as'something that is not necessary and is therefore unnecessary' which makes 'unnecessary' a sufficient interpretation. \n5: So, by using'sufficient', we are referring to an object with a level of utility that renders it unnecessary for other objects. Since, by definition, something that is sufficient does not need to be replaced or substituted by another object, it cannot be referred to as'superfluous' which is rendered redundant by the utility of another object. Moreover, utility here doesn't just refer to its usage, but also its presence. \n6: Hence, a sufficient object can be both physically and functionally present to fulfill its utility/ requirement, but if it is not needed within the function, then it can be referred to as 'unnecessary', rather than'superfluous'. \n7: So, by combining all the above information, we can conclude that an object can be called 'unnecessary' and'superfluous' since these adjectives define a level of existence and utility of an object. Moreover, the objects that are'superfluous' are defined as not useful within the function of another and are subsequently called 'unnecessary', which eliminates options B & C. \n8: Hence, we can conclude that 'unnecessary' is the correct answer.

Option, 'E: had good voice' may seem like it fits, as it indicates that the person has a specific talent and ability to sing. However, it does nothing to tell us where or how the singing occurs.\n6. After considering all the options, the correct answer is D: inhale, as it is one of the few plausible options that could indicate where the singing occurs. Additionally, it does so by relating the singing to a physical sensation, implying that singing is done in one specific location.\nSo the final  answer is D: inhaling\n\nInput: Why do parents call in sick?

B: The second option indicates that parents could call in sick from home, but this does not uniquely point to the fact that they are not in the office.\n3. C: The third option suggests that they call in sick at the hospital, but there are other possibilities for calling in sick that do not necessitate a hospital visit.\n4. D: The fourth option indicates specifically that they would call in sick at the doctor or doctor's office, but this could still occur in various places.\n5.

The second hint is that the question refers to a way, which makes sense if it was a plural form, meaning more than one way.\n3. Therefore, only the first three answer choices are valid options  meaning it is A, B or C.\nA - Believe in God\nB - Pay Bills\nC - Group Together\n4. Eliminate A - Believe in God option as it has a religious connotation which is irrelevant to the question and does not imply meeting.\n5.

A: cupboard refers to a store where one can purchase items in 'a lot of sugar'. However, this is not the context of the question since the context specifies that the item fits in one's hand. The same applies to B: chocolate, C: coffee, and E: soda pop, none of which fit within the context of the question.\n3) Option D, candy bar is likely the appropriate answer since it fits the description of being a hand-held item containing a lot of sugar.

Additionally, the context of this question does not specify whether the 'toy' is a car, a new car, or even something that a child might play with, like a Barbie. As such, it is insufficiently specific to be a valid answer.\n3. The context of the question specifically states that it is about new cars, toys, and trash bins. \n4. 'New cars' already implies that the 'car' is new, and thus Option 2, car, could be removed due to its redundancy.\n5. 'Toys' and 'new cars' both imply that they require money to acquire, so removing them is unnecessary, but 'trash bins', on the other hand, don't require money to get, being free things.\nThat leaves only 'none of those' as a valid option.\n\nSo the answer is 4: None of the above\n\nInput: Where", "answer": "D: candy bar"}

This means that to be ranked on a bell curve, a contestant should:\n1. get higher scores -> Since contestants are scored based on their performance in the competition, contestants with higher scores will be ranked higher.\n2. get lower scores -> Since contestants would rank based on their scores, high scores will result in higher placement and low scores will result in lower placement.\n3. get perfect scores -> Since perfect scores would result in a perfect score, it would be the highest score possible based on their performance.\n4. get very well -> Since very well would result in good scores, it would be ranked based on the good score results and therefore get ranked as well.\nBased on this, it can be concluded that the highest ranking score in this case would be A: get perfect scores.\nSo the final correct answer is A: to get perfect scores\n\nInput: A person who is not a carpenter and is in a kitchen can work as a __________.

These states also have New (as in New England) in their formal description. Thus, the dog would be found in one of these three states.\n\nIn North America, the dog is most likely to be found in New Mexico. New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern part of the US, and that is also where the majority of Americans live. Hence, the dog is probably found in this place.\nAlthough New England is located along the coast of North America, most Americans live inland. Therefore, the dog would be less likely to be found here than in New Mexico. Moreover, New England is not a country. Thus, E: denmark is wrong.\nSince New Hampshire is located between the borders of Maine and Vermont, the dog might actually be found here if it managed to cross the border. However, according to the question, the dog is lost, which means it is not in control of its situation.

'House' as a store could be a furniture shop, a hardware store, or any number of different stores where you can find flooring but it would not fit the given requirement.\n\n'House' as in'store' could be a furniture store or an outlet that sells home decor, but that still leaves us with a wide range of possibilities. The man could be at a furniture or home design outlet looking for flooring, but there could equally be a house supply store or hardware store where he finds flooring as well.\n\nThe term 'E: kitchen' does not specifically point to a store either and could also be either a furniture store specializing in kitchen items or just a kitchen-centric outlet.\n\nThe last and only remaining term is 'home depot'. This store is one of the most famous home improvement outlets with a very wide variety of products, including flooring. This places it as the answer to the question and the final answer is home depot \nSo the final answer in correct answer is home depot", "answer": "D: home depot"}

B: at the store C. C: at the garage D. D: at the beach E. E: at the office\nOutput: 1.) The question states that one won't have sufficient time to complete a specific task because they're simultaneously walking on the street and listening to music. 2.) In the options, the beach, garage and office are all possible locations for music related activities where one could simultaneously walk and listen to music. Hence, any of these 3 locations could be the possible answer to the question in the context of the statement. 3.) Choice E. the office, can be ruled out because of the word'street'. Music listens are often outdoors or at a club, so the office is not a plausible location choice. 4.) Since an office is not a suitable location choice, we can now discard the option of choice D, the beach and the garage are still both in the running. 5.) Choice B, the store is no longer viable, as it is one of the locations listed in the options. Hence it's a possible location to simultaneously walk, listen to music and not have enough time to complete other related tasks. 6.) Choice A, 'in the market' stands as the correct answer, as the market is a possible location where one could walk, listen to music, and then be in need of doing other tasks, but not have sufficient time to accomplish them.\nSo the final outcome is A. A: in a market\n\nInput: How is the weather like after you've cleaned the dust on the window? Choices: 1. A: sunny 2. B: windy 3. C: cold 4. D: dry 5.

{"text": "1: The question asks about a location that a certain snake would like to live in, but does not indicate what type of snake. Thus, the snake's preferences are not limited to a specific breed or type, and any given snake should be able to choose any one of the locations according to the question, assuming they are open to the given weather.\n2. Since a snake's 'typical' habitat is ground rather than water, all the locations listed except for E: garden of eded should be considered.\n3. As the answer choices have all been considered and eliminated, one can logically assume that the correct answer must be that the snake would want to live in New Mexico. It is one of the only options that can accommodate both humid and sunny weather, and also allows snakes to live on the ground. Also, according to the question, as long as the snake is warmed, it'll feel comfortable wherever it is.\nSo the final choice is C: white house and not necessarily the snake.\n\nInput: What type of shirt would be a great choice for a b-movie star to wear? Choices: 1. A: Tucked-in or B: untucked C: White D: Black E: Pink F: Patterned 2. A: Tuckeded/untucked \u2013 since the term \u2018b-movie star\u2019 implies a non-serious film, a white shirt that is untucked would fit perfectly. Additionally, as a \u2018b-movie star,\u2019 one is likely to have a non-serious attitude that aligns with the idea that a white shirt untucked is okay, even if it doesn\u2019t quite match up with the typical standard for untucked shirts which are usually not white.\n3. C: White \u2013 this would work perfectly if a b-movie star needed a white shirt while at the same time wanting an affordable option.\n4. F: Patterned \u2013 since b-movies are often cheap to make, it only makes sense that the shirts they wear are cheap as well. If a b-movie star wants a patterned shirt, they can easily go with something that looks like a band-aid.\n5. E: Pink \u2013 many people associate b-movies with the color pink.

{"text": "1. The man who sets the cup on the table does not need anything to do it. He is already at the table, and all he must do is set the cup down on the table.\n2. He likewise lacks the 'what' he needed to put on, as he didn't need anything to balance the cup.\n3. The answer thus has to be a word that would be an 'objective complement', 'tenacity' standing as the least plausible option.\n4. We then turn to 'hands', but since the man did not have enough for the object, meaning he didn't have too much, 'coaster' may be a suitable option. But this is incorrect as well, as 'coaster' does not balance an object, it rather allows it balanced.\n5. We then move on to'skill', but this can also mean that someone has enough'skill' to balance the cup and use the table as an 'objective complement'. But this is not the case.\n6. The answer thus has a more'subjectively' correct definition.\n7. Finally, the word, 'breaking', is the correct answer. It may not specifically be an 'objective subject' in this case, but it does not need to and can still qualify as a suitable option. The cup was broken, requiring the man to utilize whatever he had in order to do it.\nSo the final option is E: breaking", "answer": "D: skill"}

{"text": "1\"Which entrance would you\" means \"which one of the entrances\", \"would you use\" means \"would you use\". \n2. Thus, the question is asking which of the entrances described the user would choose to enter. Therefore the option C: \"anterior\" or \"front\" must be considered. The other options A: side; B: Main; D: \"current\" and E: Front have nothing to do with the user's decision. \n3. Also, option C: anteiror front is singular because it's a single building not multiple buildings - so we cant use the plural noun \"entrance\"\n4. Also, it's not clear what \"do not want to\" means (or maybe it's meant that the user only wants to use one of the two specified entrances). \n5. So far, only option A: \"side\" - \"at the side\" can have multiple entrances (it refers to a region) and thus \"entrance\" would need to be plural.\n6. So we could eliminate A, C: \"front\" & C: \"anterior\". \n7. The user doesn't specify not wanting to use only one out of 3 entrances (using option B: \"main\" would require using 2 entrances by using the main and then the back entrance). \n8. As the user asked about not wanting to use the back entrace, all we have to ask is what entrance do we use if we don't want t use a backend entrance. \n9.

The options given are 'park','make time for','receive instructions', 'take money' and 'leave work.'\n5. If the man ran to all these places, his kingpin would receive information about all the activities the man was pursuing, this would be the opposite of keeping his identity private, which means a 'dealer.'\n6.

The first letter of every word in the question has to be added to spell out the answer correctly.\n6. Hence, if the answer starts with CM(Currency Meter), the last four letters spell out the word, 'currency.'\n7. The other options mentioned are types of currency so that's why a cash or coins would not be the correct answer.\n8. So if the ticket was not money per se, but a type of currency, this would be a form of an entrance ticket.\n9. In that case, the man likely received a \"fair pass\" or \"admission pass.\"\n10. However, it is important to consider that the man may have received more than one ticket and not a single type. The fair may have had special categories or levels that allowed more than just one person to be awarded a single ticket.\n11. Therefore, the correct term for the ticket would be 'fair pass.'\n\nSo the final", "answer": "D: take money"}

After eliminating unreasonable options like Disneyland, the most likely places are either Snow, windowsill or Street. Because he went outside, option A is eliminated. 3. The hot surface is from the sun, option B is eliminated. 4. The word 'heat' gives me the idea that we are dealing with a very sunny place and that the street probably has no shade. Thus, it should be either the windowsill or'street' as 'the sun' is not on the windowsill itself. 5. One would expect bare feet to walk most likely on the ground on a sunny day. 6. Street is not a location, hence eliminated. 7. From the information given, we can deduce that it's very sunny out, so it stands to reason that wearing socks or footwear won't make a difference. 8.

In terms of rushing to work, C: heartburn could potentially be correct; however, heartburn can also refer to other things, including eating too much.\n5.

The fifth option, D: ontario, refers to a city in Canada, and not the lake or region. Even though the place name is in the list of options, it cannot be said to be a 'lake or river', it is more of a city. Thus, we can eliminate this option as well.\n6. Finally, the last option, E: lake or river, is vague and ambiguous because it leaves open the possibility that a beaver's dam could build in a lake or river, but could also build in a pond.\n7. There are two possible interpretations of the question which lead to different possibilities: a lake or river or a pond.\n8. After narrowing down the plausible answers, we can see that lake and river can be eliminated, so now we need to figure out which pond is more likely.\n9. A lake or river doesn't give any clue as to the type of dam the beaver would be building, nor it doesn't give a reason for why a beaver would build this dam.\n10. Pond on the other hand gives a reason. The lake/river is the one that gives the beaver food, so the beaver will naturally build a dam near it so that they won't be eaten by the predators they need to cross.\n11. Given the information in the question and the answer options given, the correct answer is E: lake or river with a special focus on pond.\nSo the final answers is E: lake or rivers with emphasis on ponds.\n\nInput:What is the result of multiplying one and a half by 10?

Choices:  a) asleep b) tired c) sleepy d) tired of sleeping e) tireless\nOutput: 1: The question asks in which way one would be if they were the fastest runner.\n2: The first answer choice, 'a) asleep'. does not apply as sleeping is not relevant to being the fastest runner. \n3: The second answer choice, 'b) tired'. is the correct answer as 'tired' means one is weary from the physical activity. \n4: The third answer choice 'c) sleepy'. also relates to the question but does not stand out as clearly as 'tired'.\n5: The fourth answer choice, 'd) tired of sleeping'. is not relevant but does not conflict with 'tired'. \n6: The last answer choice, 'e) tireless'. is quite inappropriate and does not stand out from the others. Therefore, the first choice, 'b) sleepy', stands out as the most probable answer.

Hence, not every city near the coast is also a coastal city.  \n6) In coastal areas, there is more seafood than in cities inland. Hence, coastal restaurants would have more seafood than other restaurants.  \n7) New york is a coastal city, hence, we might find seafood restaurants in new york. However, it would not be the only coastal city in the world  to offer seafood restaurants. Hence, B: coastal cities is not a sufficient answer.  \n8) Boston might be a city on the coast, but it is not as easy to identify as a coastal city in the question, since it includes other types of places as well, hence it can be excluded.", "answer": "C: city"}

While these options may include news, they also involve other forms of media - television, newspapers, emails, and websites. However, the focus is on advertisements, not news per se.\n3. The first option, 'television' could potentially work except for the fact that it's more focused on the act of watching the news vs. reading it. It may be possible to do both, but the emphasis is on reading, hence we can eliminate this option A: television.\n4. The second option, 'bus' is a form of mass transportation and may transport people to or from a market, but could also transport people to or from work, school, or other locations where a bus may not be involved with the news.\n5. 'Emails' would not be a suitable answer since they would not involve the reading of news articles. \n6. The fourth option, C: email, could be a place/venue where one might receive an email advertisement, but it's not a place where a person reads an article. \n7. The fifth option, E: la ville, is the French equivalent to the phrase 'the city' and could be used as an advertising medium or on a website. However, it would not be a place where one reads news articles and thus, is not a suitable answer.\n8. The sixth option, 'web page', is a suitable answer since it's a place where one reads articles online and it involves advertisements as well. \n9.

{"text": "Answer: C, \"Improved health\". The question asks what is a good result of running(or generally jogging). To jog is to move in a quick, light way, especially in preparation for running or as a form of exercise. In short, running. The first answer \"Insect Repellent\" is contradictory to the context of the question. Being bitten by insects is the opposite of being healthy(or not being bitten). The fourth answer \"Being Tired\" is contrary to the action of running to exercise. Hence, the answers \"Insect Repellant\" and \"Being Tired\", are incorrect. \"SHin Splints\" cannot be an answer since it's the pain in the front(front of calf muscles) of the lower leg that can affect people who exercise. It's not something you would want in a result of runing.\n\nOutput: Answer: D, \"Improved Health\". The question asks what jogging result is good. The answers that are not good results of jogging is insect repellent(can be opposite result of running), shin splints(happens if something went wrong during your run), and tiredness(happens after your run). So we can say that the correct answer is: \"improved health\". (We don't have answer to heart attack and being tired because that's not the correct answer)\n\nInput: Are there any vegetables available at a grocery store? Choices:  Incorrect A: yes B: no C: tomatoes D: carrots E: corn\nOutput: Answers: A, Incorrect and B, No. Let's tackle the question based on the structure and context. We see the question is asking whether or not vegetables are available in a grocery store. Looking at the context, we can say that vegetables can be purchased or acquired through buying. In this case, a grocery store is a viable option for acquiring vegetables as this is specifically where food products are purchased. Therefore, grocery stores can sell vegetables.\nWe can also consider other options like:\n\n* Fruits - Fruit products are also usually available in grocery stores that sell food products\n* A butcher - A butcher typically sells meat products like beef, poultry, or pork, but can sometimes", "answer": "C: improved health"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking, \"Sometimes fighting inflation...\" since 'fighting inflation' is what is done. The phrase is \"I don't know if fighting inflation is even necessary,\" so the question isn't \"what is fighting inflation\"\n2) The term 'inflation' refers to an increase in the general price level of goods and services. A drop in price or deflation is referred to as the reverse.\n3) \"Because it is so negligble\" refers to 'not worth bothering about'\n4) \"inflation\" is what is happening. What is happening also refers to 'fighting inflatation' because it's done to lower inflation. Hence, the correct answer is A: economic instability and not D: rising interest rates. \nSo the final answer Economic instability\n\nInput: A place for a celebration has a party like atmosphere. What does this mean? Choices: \tA: A party atmosphere doesn't exist\tB: The place will give you a drink\tC: the party atmosphere is like a mood\tD: The place is for celebrating parties\tE: The party will be memorable\nOutput: 1: The word 'atmosphere' indicates a'mood or feeling'\n2: The word 'atmospere' is used when a restaurant is decorated to make a 'party atmosphere', hence the answer is D: A place for celebration has a party atmosphere\nSo the final answer A place for celebration\n\nInput: A to B takes five hours.

'Thought' can't be associated with learning by yourself as we would think things through as an individual. There's therefore no reason to support a 'yes' for thought, either. 4. Thus, A: exposure only fits the criteria for answering a 'yes' or 'no' question. If a person chooses to'study' alone, that means they do not expose themselves to others who might help them learn.\n5.

It is not about what category he actually is in so the term losers is not an option. \n\n4.}The term might win is not an option either as it refers to something that may or may not happen whereas \"to win\" doesn't leave any room for guessing. \n\n5.}Therefore only the words winners and losers are left which we can evaluate by looking for which word seems like it fits with the overall context of the sentence.\n\n6.}By checking the context we can conclude that John liked being able to categorize people (in his preferred fashion) as winners or losers.\n\nSo the final answer from the above step is\n\nA:winners and losers\n\n7.}From the above we also know that the category losers is the one which we should eliminate.

{"text": "1 The question is asking the reasons that might prevent someone from purchasing Christmas presents.\n2. Based on the clues, several options may seem like potential answers. For instance, option A, 'happiness,' could seem like a plausible answer, but the idea of not purchasing Christmas presents as a result of happiness does not make sense since a person's level of happiness or sadness does not directly impact their ability to make purchases.\n3. Further, option D,'relief,' is not the answer either, as it's unlikely that a person would not purchase Christmas presents because they felt relieved.\n4. Finally, option E, 'exhilaration,' could seem like a feasible answer, but the use of the word 'exhilaration' implies that the person is experiencing feelings of excitement or exhilaration from purchasing Christmas presents, which is also implied in option C,'stress.'\nThus, options A, B, D, and E, seem incorrect, leaving only options C,'stress,' and option B, 'lack of money.'\n\n5. The correct answer is option B, 'lack o money,' as the question specifically asks about preventing someone from purchasing Christmas gifts and the statement in option B implies that a lack of money could prevent someone from buiying Christmas presents.

The word 'family' indicates that the fruit will most likely be in a household. \n4. The word'movie' indicates that the plant will not be in an outdoor garden but inside a house. \n5. The word 'theater' means a room for the viewing of movies which is not suitable for the ficus, so eliminate it.\n6. The room that has the necessary sunshine and fits all the other requirements is the 'family room'.

It is obvious from the sentence that the location is most suitable for telephone booths is a place where there is an abundance of people.\n3. In a city, there are lots of people.\n4. That is why the correct place with the most telephone boots is a city.\nSo the final ansewer is C: london\n\nInput:What is a place that you go to and where you live are the same thing? Choices:  B: airport C: street D: city E: bank\nOutput: 1)The word 'and' in the sentence tells us that 'go to' and 'live' share the same thing(the location).\n2.

Choices:  C: table tennis D: racquetball E: tennis F: badminton G: ping pong\nOutput: 1.) The question asks for a sport beside the one being played(squash(D is the correct answer))\n2. Squash is played indoor which limits the other playable sport choice to only four indoor sports.\n3. The remaining four choices are tennis(F),Bademinton(G), Ping Pong(C), Table tennis(E)\n4. The word 'play' in the sentence can also be interpreted as 'do', which is more accurate in the context of playing a sport.\n5. Hence the question's intent is to find a sport a participant can play outside squash courts if he has a game of squash.\n6. If that is the case, then the player must do tennis as tennis(F) is the only sport played outdoors, and squash is played only indoors(D).\n7.

The third option is inappropriate. 3 Option D could be a suitable option. But the word 'takes \" in option D refers to foot spas/pedicure.

{"text": "1.'Lacking immortality' suggests one cannot achieve eternal life, which means one can die or become mortal.\n2. Immortality is a state of never dying, so 'die' would be a contradiction. Hence, the correct answer would be either 'Dead' or 'Can die'.  3. 'Immortality' is an enduring, abiding feature of eternal life. The word'mortal' can also mean 'pertaining to or limited to life or death', but it also can mean'short lived'. So 'Mortal' is a very ambiguous answer.\n4. 'Can die' is the correct answer here. It implies that immortality is something that someone can achieve, which is true. There is a potential for ending immortality so therefore, one can die.  5. 'Will one day' cannot be answered directly. It doesn't specifically address the options since something related to 'will one day' is true (it is the future) \n6. 'A: kick the bucket' is a figure of speech, meaning death.  Kicking the bucket refers to the practice of drowning someone in a bucket of water. Kicking the bucket doesn't make sense in the context of an immortal person since he/she won't die, let alone drown.  So 'A: kick the bukcet' isn't relevant nor appropriate.\n7. 'B: dead' means that you're already dead (as the name suggests).  Since immortality refers to achieving the supernatural ability of never dying, Dead cannot be considered an end.  8. 'Can die' refers to dying or the state of dying. The word 'can' does not specifically mean 'can be achieved'. It's unclear what \"Can not die' means if it isn't 'immortal'. So, the question remains ambiguous. \nSo, the final answer is E: Can die\n\nInput: Which term does not apply to a person's height? Choices: 1. A: tall 2. B: short 3. C: little 4. D: shortest 5.

{"text": "1, The question is asking what enables people to transport themselves. 2, Since the question is asking about people (using the 2nd person), the option that should be picked is one that pertains to people, and not objects. 3, Options A: helicopter, B: own cars, C: speak words, D: believe in god are all people, and hence, are all plausible. It's important to note that all these four options do not require transportation (as they don't require people to transport themselves), and hence, we can eliminate these options. 4, The final option we are left with is E: dance together. The term 'dance' is used in conjunction with the term 'together' which is what brings the people together. Furthermore, 'together' implies that the people are not alone - they are together (in this case dancing), which means that they are not able to transport themselves. Hence, dance is a suitable option as it prevents the people from transporting themselves as they are together, dancing(together). Thus, the final answer is E: dance together", "answer": "B: own cars"}
{"text": "1) The question asks where one must wear a white shoe to be appropriate. \n2) Options B and C are incorrect since one needs to wear a white shoe only for tennis or for a wedding, respectively. \n3) Similarly, one can not wear a white shoe while in the house.

However, based on the hint in the question 'white shoe' suggests tennis is not the answer. \n5) Based on this information, the most likely answer is E: wedding, since a white shoe is worn to a wedding for either the bride or the groom. \nSo the final answer should be E: wedding\n\nInput: Where is a car's radiator located? Choices: 1. The radiator refers to the engine room. This implies that A, 'under the front seat', B, 'at the front' and D, 'behind the backseat' aren't suitable. \n2. Next, let's look at the remaining options. C: 'under the hood' means the interior of the car and not the engine. \n3. Therefore, C must be ruled out since cars' engines are located 'under the hood', as opposed to the engine itself which is 'under the seat'. \n4. This leaves us with A: 'under the front seat' or B: 'at the front' as the only options that are suitable. \n5. However, since the engine is located 'under the hose', the correct answer is that the radiator is 'at the front' of the car, given that the front of the car is facing where the engine is. \nSo the correct answer to this question is B: 'at the Front'\nThe final answer is B: at the Front\n\nInput: Where does the shoe go? Choices:  D: left foot E; right D: shopping store E: shoe rack\nOutput: 1: The question says where does the shoe go, implying that a left foot or right foot doesn't go anywhere, since they are parts of our bodies.

Hence cannot be correct.\n4) The third and fourth options, C and D, are locations, but neither of these are mentioned in the question and hence cannot be correct.\n5) The question specifically mentions 'the cabin' and 'the window'. It further states that the fox is visible from the window. This implies that the fox can be clearly seen from indoors and not necessarily from outside.\n6) The fifth option, E, is a picture that depicts a fox outside a cabin. But the question does not ask for such a picture, only for where the fox can actually be seen. Hence, even though this option gives a visual clue, it cannot be chosen as a valid answer.\n7) Based on this information, the only plausible answer is E: picture since the fox can only be seen from the cabin if it is from a picture depicting the fox outside the cabin.\nSo the final (incorrect) answer is E: picture\n\nInput: What is a word that can be made from the last two letters of a word 'apple'? Choices: A: papp B: apple C: pell D: pape E: leppel\nOutput: 1: Based on the clues in the question, we can eliminate options A and C (since 'leppel' does not exist as a word).\n2: We can cross out option 'D': pape since it's a combination of two words and not just the two letters from the last word of 'apple'.\n3: The options E and D are a reversal of letters from each other, hence they're not similar words from alternate words.\n4: Option E seems to have an extra letter at the end of it.\n5: The word pell refers to a ball.

Instead, the term competing itself implies competing.\n2) Moreover, 'arguing', 'debating', 'winning/losing', and'stress' are related to competitions, but this does not relate to specifically competing.\n4) We can narrow it down to a debate if people compete while debating something.\n6) In a debate, people can disagree with each other and enter into a debate, which does not constitute winning or losing though.\n5) Since people can argue during both a debate and in competition, we can eliminate 'arguing' again.\n7) The phrase 'in a competition' suggests people who are competing or compete at something. People do not compete with others by winning/losing or becoming stressed over something.\n8) A tense moment does not necessarily mean a person entered into a state of stress either.\n9) Hence, the only remaining answer is 'debate'. Since competitions and debates go hand in hand, people might enter into a debate while competing in something.\n10) We, therefore, conclude that the final answer must be C: debate.\n\n\n<br>\nThe input has been read and is available [here](assets/instructions.txt)", "answer": "C: argument"}

When this is combined with the condition of the question, that is, we must choose where something always takes place, we can eliminate the options 'Canada' and 'North Pole' (because they would need to be there to exist)\n\n3. We can also eliminate'surface of earth' since snow is a naturally occurring condition of earth that has been an ongoing phenomenon throughout earth's geological history. \n\n4. Next, we can eliminate 'africa' because it is not known to always have snow in its region. \n\n5. Hence, 'Roof' stands out as a viable option to satisfy the condition of not needing current weather occurrences. However, when combined with the term always, 'Roof' cannot be the right choice. If ever snow stops existing on the surface of the earth, it can't persist on a roof. \n\n6.

The Martian is on the Red Planet (the correct pronunciation for the planet), hence, the answer could be anywhere on the Martian surface. \n3. Since the Mars surface is divided into two halves, the two hemispheres (northern and southern), we need to consider this point in particular before choosing the correct answer. \n4. If we consider both hemispheres together, the Martian surface looks like a sphere, or like a ball. This means that the \"Indian Ocean\" is on the Mars surface but not in the center (for obvious reasons).\n5. Therefore, we can discard all the options that contain \"Earth\" (B, D, and E). \n6. We cannot find the Indian Ocean in any of \"Asia\"'s geographical countries (nor B,D, or E) as they are all located on planet Earth.\n7.

If the answer is b = Growth is slowin' down, it would mean that competition is high and therefore, in fact, growth may not be slowing down but is still rapid. It would be the opposite for b = Growth going too fast. It's unlikely in that case that the banking industry is so fast-growing that other competitors are getting too few opportunities or unable to catch up, which would lead to the increase in competition mentioned. \n3We can, thus, eliminate b) Growth slowin' down since the other option of b) Growth going too fa is not likely true. We can next try to eliminate d) Competition is lowerin'\n4d) Competition is lessenin' would not suggest competition decreasing but rather, increasing. Hence, it can be eliminated as well. \n5The remaining choice is", "answer": "B: get laid"}

For example, an anthology of short stories, novels, recipes, or photographs would all be viable answers. \n\n`C) dull read`: This could be any material that is not exciting or captivating. This includes things like essays, memoirs, and reference materials. \n\n`E) surface of earth`: This could mean any location or space, for example, 'the surface of the Earth' or the'surface of Mars'.

Choices: A: motorcar. B: horse cart. C: speedometer. D: gasoline station. E: stop watch\nOutput: 1: The question asks for a place someone in a hurry would go to. 2. 'Motorcar' is not a destination, but a vehicle, so we can cross it out. A 'Motorcar is a vehicle with an internal combustion engine and is driven by electricity'.\n3. The word 'hurry' is used only in the context of rushing to a destination and so a place to go would be a 'Horsecart' because it is a vehicle for a rider to ride in and is driven by an animal that is not an 'electricity engine'.\n4. The word 'Speedometer' is used to measure the speed of the vehicle. So a'speedometer' is not a place to go when someone is in a hurry and hence, does not answer the question of being in a hurry, if one has a speedometer.\n5. 'Gasonline station' is the place where one goes to fill up the tank of a car.\n6. The word 'Stopwatch' is used to measure time. So a'stopwatch' cannot be considered a place one would go to. \n7.

The second choice B: room, is a place, but not one in which furniture would be put 'above' something. \n4.)

It should be noted that this question is worded as \u2018forever\u2019 which might possibly be inferred as a reference to the Kentucky Derby which is an annual event. However, it is still possible that the question is just worded that way for emphasis.\n3. The only two horses to achieve what the question is asking is Secretariat (who has won all three races) and this is how we know that option E: triple crown is incorrect.\n4. The question is asking one way of commemorating a horse forever, not several. Although, it is possible to commemorate a horse in several ways, only one way might fit the requirements and that option is D: painting.\n5. However, option D: painting is not one way to commemorate a racehorse(we are commemorating one horse of many and not the entire race).\n6. An option with only one viable way to meet the requirement is preferable than an option that can be applied in multiple ways.\n7.

{"text": "1: The question asks about a cupboard where after being dried, the mug can be returned. \n2. After the question 'where do I put my coffee' the next word is'mug'. A cupboard is a good place to put mugs as they are mostly used to keep crockeries.\n3. Further, if there was any doubt about placement, the word 'after' in a question can help us distinguish between a 'put' that we can be doing in an arbitrary place(for example when we dry the mug we don't start thinking about putting the mug away so the 'after' can be ignored) and 'after' that has to be done 'after' something specific has been done. \n4. So 'putting the mug away after drying' only makes sense if we know there's a place where we can put the mugs away, since 'after' implies a necessity which is only fulfilled if after the mug is dried.\n5.

The building looks like its been abandoned, has no electricity and is not in a good condition. The options are \"Apartment building\", \"Skyscraper\", \"House\", \"Shopping mall\" and \"Office\".\nThe picture clearly says Apartment building, so answer option cannot be any other options.\n\nIf we see answer \"Skyscraper\",\"House\",\"Shopping mall\",\"Office\".\n\nSkyscrapers are tall buildings.\n\nHouse is house.\n\nShopping malls are centers where you can buy things and are not buildings.

{"text": "The question asked about an effect other than a spouse suffering when a couple divorced. \n1. The answer would not only have to affect the person who is not a spouse, but the effect would also have to be negative. \n2. Choice A, being grief, causes a negative reaction since it's the opposite of happiness. On the other hand, choice B, being depression, is a negative reaction with a negative emotion, so it's a potential answer. \n3. Choice C, being a lack of a spouse, is a neutral reaction that doesn't have any negative or positive association. \n4. Choices D and E both refer to children suffering which doesn't only affect the children themselves but the parents, so we can eliminate these. \n5. Since there are already two negative answers, it's reasonable to eliminate any more. \n6. Hence, A: lot of griev is the only positive answer. \nSo the final answer then is A: lot of grieve.\n\nInput: The bartender is pouring what in a cocktail shaker?

{"text": "1.'What he loved' refers to James, and 'all the time' refers to his interests. Given there is a book about Mars: this can only refer to the idea of being on Mars.\n2. Since 'books' in terms of literature, must refer to a genre. He does not always read these books, just sometimes.\n3. Therefore, the correct answer must be somewhere that he goes regularly. The idea of mars is not a location.\n4. 'The library' also does not really fit this context, since the location does not have a name.\n5. Given 'zoo', we can exclude it from our list.\n6.

{"text": "1. Given that the question deals with'storing a small notepad', we can infer the type of notepad to be of a smaller size, and not bulky. Hence, the answer choice would most likely be B: meeting or A: back pocket. \n2. Based on the question, both B: meeting and A: back pocket are in the 'personal space' of the person. It refers to a place that can be brought along at all times, such as a wallet, purse, keychain, etc. \n3. A'meeting' typically takes place indoors in a space with walls, which means that a back pocket is not a relevant answer choice given that a back pocket is inside a pair of trousers. \n4. A 'drug store' is a commercial venue that deals in pharmaceuticals, medicines, etc but does not involve storing a small notepad in the personal space of a person, therefore, ruled out. \n5. A 'home' could refer to housing or one's personal space. Since the question is dealing with storing a small notepada in one's personal space, 'home' is ruled out.\n6. A'school' involves studying and is not related to storing a small notepard in the personal space of the person. So it's ruled out.\n7. Based on the above, the answer is C: drug store given that the location is commercial and can store the small notepad.

We must then analyze the options and choose one that best fits the bill.\n2) The first option, A:'get angry' does not exactly show us the exact results of reading a newspaper when it comes to local news, so we can eliminate A: get angry \n3) The second option, B:'concern' is not exactly a direct'result' or output that reading a newspaper gives us, but is rather a feeling that can be created by local news. For example, one may feel concerned about the direction the city is headed after reading the newspaper.\n4) The third option, C:'worry' is not an emotion that is necessarily brought about by reading the newspaper. In other words, one could worry about certain issues without reading the newspaper, so we can eliminate C: Worry\n5) The fourth option, D:'Education' has to do with gaining knowledge that might come out of reading the newspaper, but this isn't a direct result that reading the newspaper gives us, and hence we can eliminate D:'education\n6) The fifth and final option, E:'Learning about the world,' is similar to D and C in that it refers to knowledge gained from reading the newspaper, but it doesn't refer to a particular feeling or emotion that one experiences, so we can rule E: Learning About The World.\n7) When we combine the reasons above, we see that the answer must be what results from reading a newspaper, and that it is, in fact, concern' that results from reading the newspaper.\n8) That being said, we can conclude that the correct answer is, 'concern,' since this best matches what results from reading a local newspaper.\nSo the final answe is C: concern\n\nInput: Read newspapers for how much money: 10.

To buy books on different subject areas, one will go to a bookstore, which is a place one would use to buy books. Here, \"buy\" is used as a verb to indicate the action of purchasing. \n3. Hence if one is asked, \"Where would one go to buy books on the subject, one would search in a bookstore. \n4. Books on the subject of healthcare can be found in any bookstore, since books on the subject of anything is available. \n5.

On closer inspection, both buildings and bridges can be seen as potential locations for the appearance of shadows if they are illuminated appropriately. \n6. Even though building and bridges can both be considered potential locations for shadows, buildings seem to better fit the idea of a 'place' compared to a bridge, as they refer to a physical structure and not just a temporary arrangement of materials. \n7. The third option C: bridge, can now be eliminated as it is not a building. \n8. Eliminating options 6 and 5, it is clear that a building seems to be the best answer in this case as it is a long-lasting structure used for various purposes. \n9. After weighing the evidence collected, the correct answer in this case is B: building as it represents the location where one can generally expect to see shadows.\nSo the final answe r is B: building\n\nInput:What is a winding road called in English?

This means looking for an answer that describes a way in which George intentionally or unintentionally thwarted the surprise.\n2) Choice A: hiding is incorrect, as hiding would be a cover-up rather than an act that could be considered ruining the surprise.\n3) Choice C: the expectation of the surprise is not an act that ruins a surprise, but rather reveals it, so that's not the answer either.\n4) Choice D: knowledge of the surprise is not necessary to ruin the surprise, so that doesn't apply either.\n5) Choice E: planning, on the other hand, would be relevant if it was done maliciously or accidentally, perhaps by informing someone else of the surprise or by inadvertently revealing it. Since it's up to the person with the surprise to determine whether or not George knowingly ruined the surprise, it's impossible to definitively say if it was accidental or deliberate, but it's highly likely that George knowingly ruined it.\n6) Taking everything into consideration, the most likely answer would be D: knowingly. George likely meant to ruin the surprise and did so knowingly. Therefore, the correct answer is D: knowing.\nSo the final is D: knowingly\n\nInput:When the ticker tape starts, do you expect it to be in color? Choices:  (1) No  (2) Yes\nOutput: The question asks how one would expect the ticker tape to look like.

{"text": "1: The question asks about where fish spend the majority of the time. It is possible to tell which answer would be correct because it is in the options where it mentions that fish are in water a significant amount of time. Hence, water will mostly contain the fish as it would the majority of another option.\n2: Bodies of water are large bodies, for example, seas, oceans, rivers, lakes, etc. They all are different. Hence, 'body of water' excludes lake superior as there are only two options that can be considered water for the fish.  \n3: The lake is one of those options. Hence, one must look at the other options. If one does not include the other options in the consideration, it may choose lake superior incorrectly. \n4: The other option in the options that comes to mind is the ocean. The question asks where the largest body of water is. Hence, lake superior is excluded as the ocean is the largest body of water.\n5: Another option is water in general. But, the question clearly mentions water in specific. Hence, this option is not correct.\n6: It excludes toilet because this option includes a toilet. A fish cannot spend a majority of its time in a toilet because it is underwater, an answer that is already in the answer options.\n7: The other option in that area would be aquarium. But, one could not spend the vast majority of the time in an aquarium as it is not a body of water.\n8: Combining all the points, the best answer would need to be D: aquarium as that could be considered a body of water.   \nSo the final answer, with the greatest certainty, is D: aquarium\n\nInput: What is the common theme among the three?

Choices: 1. What's up? 2. How about that? 3. I wonder why? 4. I guess so 5. Did you see that?\nOutput: 1.) 'What's up' is a phrase used to ask how someone has been doing recently and is a formal way to ask a question.\n2.) 'How about that' is a phrase that can be used in both formal and informal contexts to convey a positive statement or reaction and does not directly ask a question.\n3.) 'I wonder why' is a question that is used to seek an explanation or explanation for something and is a formal way of asking questions.\n4.) 'I guess so' is a phrase used as a vague response, which does not directly ask questions.\n5.) 'Did you see that' is a phrase used in both formal and casual contexts as a way of expressing surprise or excitement about something and does not directly asking a question.\n6.)

{"text": "1) The first step is to understand what the strategic gold reserve is and what the key attributes are before attempting to answer the question. Here, the'strategic gold reserve' refers to the physical gold held by a central bank primarily for use in international transactions. \n2) Therefore, any storage location could be an answer to the question, as gold is not normally stored in a treasure chest and is not 'jewelery'. However, there are only 5 choices, so 5 places need to be looked at. \n3) Of these 5 locations; 2 must be in the US, and we are told the value is a 'Gold Bullion'. The gold must be in a vault, not jewelery, and so we narrow it down to the locations that meet these requirements, which leaves us with choices; B: fort knox, C: church. \n4) We eliminate 'jewelery store' as we know the gold is already at a bullion level, and 'jewelery' is not gold. So we are left with 2 options, B: fort knox and C: church. 5) Now, church and fort knox fit all the other requirements, but there must be one that only fits the requirement of being a national US military storage and not an army storage, so we eliminate B: fort knox because it is also a military storage. \n6) So finally, we come back to C: church as it is the only option that has only met the criteria of a national US military storage, so the correct answer is C: church. 7) Now that the questioner has this information, the question becomes, why is the gold stored in a church and not a vault? \nSo the final answer, as requested, is C: church", "answer": "B: fort knox"}

The question then asks how one might determine if more than a quarter of a population regards itself as \"very religious.\"\n3. One option is to look at the percent of \"very religious\" people in a given sample compared to the population of that sample. If a sample had 33% of the population identifying with \"very religious\" then the sample would have a higher percent of \"very religious people\" than the population as a whole. \n4. Thus, if the population as a whole is 32% \"very religious,\" then a sample with 32% or more must be greater than 32% \"religious.\"\n[5] Another way of answering is to consider what happens if we look at a sample with slightly less than 32% of people identifying as \"very religious.\" If a sample had 26% of the population identifing as \"very religious,\" for example, then more than a quarter of this smaller population would need to be 26% in order", "answer": "D: kind"}

However, excitement and boredom can also be a possible answer, since these feelings are possible outcomes of visiting new places.\n4/ This question asks specifically for the emotion/feeling felt. Wonder is a type of awe that is an action (awe-ing/wonder-ing). Fear is an emotion/feeling. Curiosity, excitement, and boredom can all be emotions/feelings.

The third option, cellars, doesn't make any sense. It involves underground basements rather than liquid meals. \n4. The fourth option, soup, doesn't make much sense either. While one might use pepper and salt in soup, soup is a type of broth while pepper and salt are meals, hence the incorrectness of this option. \n5.

Continents often overlap marine territories such as the open ocean, gulf of mexico, etc.\n6. We are looking for a specific place to understand and analyze the migration of shark. \n7. The best option that seems to fit all of these requirements is \"The coral reef\". \n8. Although they can find a shark in a television program, a gulf of mexico etc, then we still need to know where they found this particular shark. \n9.

Choices: A: lobster B: cheese cake C: cocktail D: spaghetti E: ice cream\nOutput:\n1) We are looking whether we will be eating something or not.\n2) The key idea can be understood from the question is-\"take a trip to the Bahama is going to eat\".

{"text": "1: The word 'grape' makes it clear that the item has to be a fruit, not vegetables. \n2: Chopping indicates that the item has to make use of the cutting feature, not just slicing. \n3: The wording 'chopped up' suggests that chop should mean to cut into pieces. \n4: The question says which ONE chopping action is required, which would rule out multiple choppings. \n5: Given these points, one has to chop the grape once to get the actual fruit and can then put that fruit in an usable form by placing them in one of the baskets mentioned. Hence, the correct answer would be any one of the four baskets. \n6: We need to take into account that the question includes the specific fruit type grape to eliminate the fruits cocktail and wine. \n7: The specific mention of chopping implies that the action has to be carried out by the one using the question, not something done externally. \n8: Combined with the previous points, this eliminates A, B and C. \n9: The word 'one' as the plural form of 'you' suggests that it has to be ONE grape chopping action that the question refers to and NOT multiple actions. Hence, the wording also eliminates 1 grape as not feasible.\n10: This leaves only 2 basket choices, D and E. However, the question also mentions a grape in the baskets. The grape being mentioned in the baskets suggests that they are either basket containing just one fruit, like grapes or fruits in an assembled form. This cancels out one of the choices. \n11: Finally, the word choice can be ruled out by noticing that D has been mentioned twice, including the previous answer. This excludes all fruit cocktail baskets. 12: Similarly, only the fruit basket and fruit cocktail would have wine if the choice was given but it has not been, so the fruit cocktail basket has been eliminated. \n13: A fruit cocktail basket as the final answer also has to be combined with the fruit basket, since it is a variation of the same which excludes E since it already includes all the items mentioned. \n14: After evaluating all", "answer": "D: fruit cocktail"}

Choices:  A. grocery stores are open at lunchtime B. people often buy food for brunch C. people often eat brunch at stores D. they go to church to get groceries E. churches often have food giveaways\nOutput: 1 The question asks why people go into a grocer after church. 2 Church is open on Sundays and Mondays because that is the day of worship for the church. 3 Going into a grocery after church is a bad idea. Therefore, we can eliminate B (because they don't go to a grocery store to buy food after worship.) and E (because Church doesn't often give gift cards.) 4 A (Grocery stores are open over lunchtime) and D (church goers are often brunch) are plausible answers. 5 A (Because grocery stores are often open over lunchtime. 6 A (because grocery stores are usually open over lunchtime.)

{"text": "1) The question mentions'steakhouse', which implies a restaurant serving steak. Rereading the question reveals that the 'best steakhouse' is not in its original region, that it's 'outside the South'. \n2) We then consider the term 'outside the South' which implies anywhere except the region of the original steakhouse. Therefore, one can conclude that James visited an area where the original steakhouse is not located.\n3) Also, as far as the term 'best' is concerned, it can be understood from the context that 'best' means it is not in the South but somewhere else, hence it must be considered outside of the South.\n4) Additionally, there is a hint in the question that the term 'outside' should be used to mean a geographically remote location rather than 'outside' the South to mean 'inside the South but at a distance'. \n5) Hence, James visited Florida.\nSo the final option is E: florida", "answer": "D: michigan"}
{"text": "1.) The sentence is written as 'Utensils are useful during dinner, but not during the night.' So the answer is only one where utensils are not used during night time, or more specifically 'at night.' Thus, B: closet and C: drawer are eliminated since both involve utensils being stored at night, i.e., during their regular daytime hours.\n\n3.) D: dinner. Dinner is clearly the relevant activity, as seen from the sentence \"Utensils are also useful during dinner, but they are not so common to carry around throughout the day.\" \n4.) At this point, it seems like there is a high probability that all the answers are relevant, but we need to make sure that A: backpack and E: cupboard are also eliminated since these answers are given as incorrect, contradicting the previous inference that all the options might work. These two wrong answers are also irrelevant and don't make sense with the sentence context. If utensils were useful at night, there would be high probability that they would be carried. So, by elimination, A: backpack and 5.) E: cupboard are eliminated.\n\n6.) E: cupboard. It's possible to eat dinner at night and take utensils out, but then there would be risk of dropping the utensils and losing the dinner food. So, it's a logical impossibility since the dinner would then be a no-show. Therefore, utensils would be better stored in a cupboard. \n\nFinally, the correct answer is E: cupboard since this is the only correct answer left and is also given as an incorrect answer, in other words, the most uncommon, hence the best possible answer.\nSo the final answers is E: cupboard", "answer": "D: dinner"}

Have to sleep refers to having to sleep (which is a verb and not a noun)\n5. Row boat is a type of boat used by humans to traverse. Thus, it is human powered in this sense\n6.

B: pay merchands with money, C: spend money, D: demand satisfaction, describe actions taken in stores, however, the other one (B), viz.

{"text": "1.) Explanation for the answer- The question asks \"What is a useful activity to undertake when experiencing lonelieness?\" or what can you do or what should you do.\n2.) The first option \"A: meet people\" gives no insight on what to do specifically and also does not explain how to deal with loneliness. \n3. Hence eliminating this.\n4.) The second option \"B: meet friend\" could be correct as it can be considered a useful activity by some but is not specific enough to be considered the correct answer.\n5.) The three remaining options given include \"C: make people laugh\", \"D: socialize\" and \"E: liquor\". It is important to note that \"socialize\" does not necessarily have to imply getting tipsy. \"socialize\" can just mean meeting or spending time with people.\n6.) However, the other two options, \"C: make people laught\" and \"E: alcohol\" seem more useful to deal with lonelieness than others.\n7.) Thus, by considering these 3 options, it is evident that \"D: socialize and E: liquor\"are the correct options. As we can infer from this option, you can meet and/or socialize with people who may be of a different mindset and thus may provide you some new information to understand that helps you deal with loneliness or it may be that you may just get a bit drunk with your friends.\nSo the final answe is D: socialize and E : liquor\n\nInput: Which is the most useful way to spend money with the least hassle?

New York and Los Angeles are specific cities (C) and Washington DC and Seattle can be cities (A), so we cannot eliminate A or E.\n2.) Now we consider B: New York. New York is located in New York. So we need to look into the next option (which is C)\n3.) And we can notice that Seattle is also located in Washington (which is C) and so are Spokane, Olympia and Puyallup (all these options are on Bing Maps). These four cities can be a part of one state, which would be Washington (which answers the second choice)\n4.) At this point, we only have states are the remaining options\n5.)

A: hospital 2. B: store 3. C: home 4. D: post office 5. E: university\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about the place where one can find an office. Let's look at each option. 2) 'Hospital' is a place of healthcare, so we can eliminate the option containing 'home'. 3) 'University' is a place of learning. People attend university to learn skills. Hence, it does not fit here. 4) Post office is not an organization of offices. One can find offices in an office building. So we eliminate this option too. 5) If you think of a'store' you may think of a place where people will meet. People will also meet at an office. So, the option which says'store' needs to have more information. 6) 'Home' is the fourth option. It does not fit the bill, though.

{"text": "1) The question is asking what prevents someone from getting sleep, which suggests a situation where one does not fall asleep or cannot stay asleep.\n2) The first option, A. relax, is not an option as it doesn't actually prevent one from sleeping but rather helps to promote sleep.\n3) The second option, B. dreams, is not an option either since dreaming refers to the activity of imagining things during sleep, not the prevention of it.\n4) The third option, C. have nightmares, could be a potential option, but it does not always prevent someone from falling asleep in the first place but only disturbs their sleep once they do fall asleep.\n5) The fourth option, D. restlessness, could be a potentially suitable option as it prevents one from getting sleep by disrupting their resting period. However, this refers to an emotional state resulting from physical restlessness, which might not always occur as a result of sleep deprivation.\n6) The fifth option, E. snore, is not relevant since snoring does not necessarily prevent one from getting sleep, as it can be a symptom of sleep deprivation or just an annoying habit, rather than a cause of it.\n7) Hence, after evaluating all options we can narrow it down to either the second option B. dreams or the fourth option D. restlessness. \n8) After further evaluation, the correct choice to make would be D: restlessness. Restlessness is the state of feeling unable to relax or keep still as a result of being uncomfortable, anxious, or excited. \n9) This state may occur due to emotional or physical reasons. For the most part, a state resulting from emotional reasons is not related or similar to that due to physical reasons.\n10) Sleeping problems are related to sleep and resting, whereas physical restlessness is due to the lack of physical comfort and/or the fear of things that trigger the cause of restlessness.\n11) However, sometimes, restlessness may be a combination of emotional and physical reasons; which is why restlessness is not included in any one of the other four options.\n12) Thus, restlessness is the correct option because it's a state that is caused by emotional or physical reasons and prevents one from getting sleep", "answer": "D: restlessness"}

The only option that describes the correct feeling is E: owning, as the owner of something is someone who is 'pleased' to find he 'owns' it.  \n4. Therefore, the correct answer is E: owning.\nSo the final is E: owning\n\nInput: Did you hear about John's house? It had so many bedroom windows that the owner had to hire a whole extra maid to clean all the windows in the daytime.  Which of the following jobs are the maid doing according to the story? Choices:  a: washing glasses b: polishing mirrors c: cleaning blinds d: wiping the floor e: wiping the window\nOutput: 1) The correct answer to the question follows one of the following two rules. \n2) Option A: 'hired a whole extra maid' - Rule 1 - The question asks about a maid that the house owner 'hired extra' to clean the windows in the day time, meaning that she's already hired, thus is already a maid, i.e. cleaning her job and has just moved jobs, therefore it's Rule 2. \n3) Option B: 'extra maid'. This does not make sense because extra here means added extra, i.e. excess or additional, unlike the literal definition of 'extra'. Therefore rule 2 is ruled out. \n4) Option C: 'whole extra maid' is very similar to the term 'whole extra', meaning not just additional, but excessive and also not applicable since it's not mentioned earlier in the story so it's unlikely that this is exactly what the maid is meant to be doing. Similarly options D: 'whole extra' and E: 'extra whole' are neither mentioned nor stated in the question so it stands out as irrelevant", "answer": "D: agony"}
{"text": "1: As the question asks what kind of thing is being looked for when competing against another person. The meaning of the phrase 'to compete against' has several potential meanings depending on the context, but the most common would be to gain an advantage over another person.\n2. The choice A: edge, does not make sense as an advantage gained in a competitive situation is generally regarded as a positive factor. No option for edge could be found in the other four alternatives.\n3. Choice B: desire to win is not desirable in a competition, as it would simply describe a motive to win. In order to assess the other choices, keep in mind this information.\n4. Choice C: friendship does not make sense in a competition scenario, as one would generally not be competing against a friend. Keep this fact in mind to rule out potential answers that sound plausible at first, but are ultimately not applicable to the real world scenario.\n5. Choice D: rivalry is a potential answer that sounds plausible, as some people might view another person as a rival and seek to gain an advantage over them. However, it's important to realize that in most competitive settings, one would not be directly competing against someone in close proximity, which rules out D as a potential answer.\n6. Therefore, after eliminating all the incorrect options, it becomes clear that the only appropriate choice is E: skill. In the context of competition, developing one's skills is essential in distinguishing oneself from others, regardless of whether one is competing against a friend, enemy, or rival.\nSo the final choice is E: skill\n\nInput: Why is it bad that one is wearing a yellow ball point cap\nwhile making a trip to a hotel?

{"text": "1.'Three quarters of' is used as an antonym to 'one quarter of' in the question, hence the answer must be the exact opposite of 'one quarter of'.\n2.'One quarter of the ocean' refers to the area covered by the ocean. Since we're referring to a large area, the correct answer can be from A-E.\n3. From the choices A-E, the correct answer has to either be B-C or E. \nThis is because choices D-E aren't covered by water. Hence, these have to be eliminated.\n4. We know from the previous point that choices A-B and options D-E are not relevant, hence we are left with choices A-C, but there is still ambiguity.\n5. A can be eliminated because it's referred to waterfalls, not the ocean, and B can be eliminated because the answer doesn't have to be part of the exact area covered by the ocean, it just has to be a quarter of it.\n6. This leaves us with 2 possible choices: C or E.\n7. From the remaining options C and E, it can be deduced that E has to be the correct answer because it's the only answer that is not covered by land, and refers to the river. The ocean and river are often conflated because of their association with water, hence the correct answer is E: river\nSo the final answer should be E: river\n\nInput: What is the name of the book that describes what a person can do to change their health for the better?

It's also not possible for the book to discuss all forms of exercise, it can only suggest one that you can start with.\n6. It then has to be for beginners since there are varying levels of difficulty in exercise, starting from no exercise at all to very advanced levels.\n7.

Among the given choices, the options 'bathroom', 'conference' do not seem to be directly related to watching a new movie as expected in the question.\n3.) The option 'town' is not correct because the phrase 'go see' indicates that it's a form of movement, not a place, where one can watch a new movie, in the 'theater'.\n4.) Similarly, the option 'theater' could be correct because a theater is indeed a place where one can watch a movie. However, it is usually a dedicated place or one where they usually offer a wide variety of plays or events.\n5.) Thus, to deduce the right option from the given choices, we have to eliminate other misleading options. \n6.) From what has been discussed so far, option 'E: train station' seems to be the correct choice as the option gives the context of being inside the theater to which one is able to go and watch a new movie.\n7.)

{"text": "1. The question asks where you would buy a ticket to sit is a room with a lot chairs facing the same directions. \n2. Chairs are common items in a room. Hence, the room refers to a living room(a small room on an apartment, used for relaxing). \n3. Theater and church have pews, which resemble chairs, but they may be confusing to someone who wants to sit in a room. Hence they have been discarded. \n4. The term conference means a meeting of people to discuss something important, to solve a problem or to reach an agreement (Oxford). \n5. This meaning does not resemble the question's question to sit in a room's answer. Hence conference is eliminated. \n6. A theater can accommodate a lot of chairs, but a theater is not a room, hence it too is eliminated. 7.  A building can also accommodate a lot of seats, but again, it is not a room, therefore, it can also be discarded. \n8. Floor can also have numerous chairs, but not facing the same direction. Therefore, it is also eliminated. \n9. Lastly, the answer is C: building because building has many rooms(even though the question didn't ask for it to be specific, a room and not a building) and can have a lot of chairs with chairs facing the same way.  This is because there might be multiple rooms in a building and every room has been made individually. As a result only a building answer can suffice.\nSo the final Answer is C: building\n\n\n\nInput: If you are looking for a place to sit in front of a room with a lot people sitting in desks, where would you go?

{"text": "1, The question asked us to find out the colors of the keys.\n2, The first option A: front pocket is not an option because there exist other colors like red, green, blue, etc. In other words, 'black and white' are not enough to identify an object of a specific color in your pocket, and there might be other items as well, like red and blue keys, etc.\n3, Therefore, the second option B: cabinet is not correct (because the cabinet may contain black or brown keys). \n4, The third option C: purse can also not be correct according to the fact that there are various types of keys and it's more than sure that these keys are not purse keys. \n5, We need more information to answer the question.

Plug, knobs, and switches would not be the right answers, because they do not turn on and off a lamp.\n3. The key answer does not make sense, because keys usually belong to locks, which have been made out of metal.\n4. Lamp keys also might be made of metal, but that is not the requirement. \n5.

{"text": "1. First, let's consider what the question asks: for a laundry room. A laundry room is a place where an individual, usually a person from a household, could wash their clothes or linens. \n2. Next, let's consider the given options. \n3. The first option 'A: house' is not relevant because a house usually includes a laundry area where one could wash their clothes and linens.\n4. The second option 'B: hotel' might seem like a potential answer at first, but it cannot be one since only staff could clean/wash hotel clothes. That is, a hotel would have a washroom or laundry room where it's staff could wash the hotel's bed sets, towels etc. which makes it inaccessible to the public so its not in accordance with the question that the laundry room should be used by staff only.   \n5. The third option 'C: green house' is misleading since its primary purpose is to house plants, not clothes. We can further determine that this option is inaccurate by referring to its name 'green house', which is an established common name for such establishments.\n6. The fourth option 'D: college' cannot be correct because we can refer to the word 'college' is a term for a specific educational institution that educates students at university,and not the laundry room specifically. Hence, it's not a place where you could find this room alone, nor is it a staff-only laundry room.\n7. The last option 'E: dorm' is the only option that fits since a dorm is a student hall in which students of a college live. Also, according to 'college', staff/lecturers can also work/live in these. That way, it seems that a college dorm may have/become staff-only laundries. It's easy to determine that the answer is 'E: dorm'.\nSo the final answer in this case is E: dorm", "answer": "B: hotel"}

Choices: 1) A: iron plate B: steel plate C: iron bar D: 3/4-inch steel pipe\nOutput: Option A (10) is the strongest for construction with regards to strength and durability. Steel is composed of iron (a strong magnetic metal) and is reinforced by a carbon composition to make what people consider to be the strongest metal and the most used metal for construction. The second strongest is option B (002) which is steel pipe, also because of its composition. These metals are made up of iron and are reinforced by a combination of a small amount of carbon content. While option A (100) is more used for construction than iron plate, because it is a cheaper, more economical material, it is not as tough as iron plate and steel pipes. Option C (0001) is iron. While it is commonly used in construction because it is one of the strongest metals in existence, one would not use it to build a house or a structure. Iron is tough but not structurally strong. Option D (0000) would be 3/4-inch steel pipe, but this would need to be reinforced or constructed to have strength, durability and to be useful in construction. Option E (000011001) is not a metal.

Symphony refers to a large orchestra performance with a conductor. It includes symphonic instruments. However, it doesn't mention brass and string instruments specifically. It might be a good option initially, but let's see if we can find any other viable options.\n3. The next option, B:band, includes instruments such as the trumpet and clarinet but not the violin or viola. The fact that it's playing music in a group suggests that it wouldn't be playing them as individuals, therefore it's unlikely to be the correct option.\n4. Similarly, C:create music refers to someone creating music alone or with others(other musician/s) but doesn't mention brash and string instruments which are part of the question's question.\n5. E: string quartet is a group made up of two violins, a viola, and a cello. The string instruments are all mentioned, but a violin isn't mentioned and thus is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n6. Looking at the other options to determine what they mean leads to D: orchestra. The word'symphony' is used in the sense of a large orchestra performance, so 'orchestra' most likely means the same thing. \n7. The correct answer is therefore D: orchestra.\nSo the final is D: orchestra\n\nInput: What does a 6-5 win in baseball mean?

Choices:  a. the entrance b. the exit c. the middle park area d. the grass e. the playground\nOutput: 1 The question asks about a location in a park where one is engaged in a picnic.\n2 It's important to remember to specify if the picnic is being done for a group or on a personal level. If only one person is picnicking, it should be considered a personal event and hence we'll exclude the answers that refer to being in a group.\n3 To identify a location in the park, we can first determine whether it's a personal or group activity by analyzing the word 'Picnic'. \n4 If it's a personal event, the only location that will work will be the 'entrance' to the park. This is because the person is entering the park where the picnic is to be held and there is no need to specify the 'exit' or'middle' of the park since there is no need to be on each of these parts during the picnic.\n5 If the picnic is a group activity, it would refer to the 'entrance' and 'exit' to the park, as there will be multiple", "answer": "B: wine press"}

Since a ticket is a document or piece of paper that certifies admission to a given place, it would not be practical to purchase it from a business that has nothing to do with tickets, such as McDonald's. Tickets could only be bought from businesses that sell tickets or related products. Hence, we can eliminate A: McDonald's.  \n3.

Therefore, we can eliminate B: restaurants since it doesn't make sense for bars to sell food.\n4. On the other hand, pubs/bars are meant to serve drinks, typically alcoholic, and thus the possibility that they'd also sell alcohol becomes more plausible.\n5. Moving on, in a park seems to be a possible option since it's a relatively open public space where alcohol, and also safety glasses, are usually found, however these would still be of the typical variety.\n6.

B: In the same vein, one could argue that since an adullt is already expected to pay bills, they are not expected to do so. \n4. But there are several reasons why we should not eliminate \"B: own property\" and \"C: pay bills\" from the options. Firstly, in certain cultures, adults are expected to own property (e.g. land, vehicles, appliances, etc). Secondly, adults are expected and required to pay bills. This is done by making payments to utility firms through one's bank or cash transactions. Hence, \"B: own property and \"C: pay bill\" should not be eliminated as incorrect  options for the question asks which adult people or typically expected to do usually. From a combined perspective, adults typically expect to own property and pay bills, although it is only adults who are expected to do these. \n5. D: Smoking and E: talk to each adult are not actions nor actions of adults. Instead, these are habits often associated with adults and the choices of \"Smoking\" and \"Talking to each adult\" should be eliminated.\n6: After we eliminate the remaining incorrect options, the only choice that remains is \"A: shake hands\" which means that adults are usually expected to have to shake hands as being an adult often involves interacting with other people.\n7: So the final answer is A: shake hands", "answer": "C: pay bills"}
{"text": "1 This question asks if the option of 'getting in line' is the best choice. 2 We must look at what 'getting in line' gets one in the end. \n3 The 4 options given are: 4 A: Being Ordered - When people get in line, they are often ordered by the person taking their place in line. They cannot choose where they stand. 5 B: Less Confusion - When people get in different lines, there may be confusion as to which line they are supposed to be in. It is also possible that people in different lines may get disordered and disruptive. 6 C: Boredom - When people stand in a long line, they tend to get bored. They can talk to the people next to them or look at things around them but they still must stand in line. 7 D: Standing in Line - When people choose 'Standing in Line' as their option, they stand in line to wait until it is their turn. While in line, they do not get disrupted by other factors and it is the same queue for everyone. 8 E: Have to wait for - When people get in a line, they wait to get their turn in whatever is on offer in that particular line. This could be a coffee shop, a restaurant, or a doctor's office. 9 Based on the information above, we can conclude that: 10 A: Being Ordered is the least desirable option of all the listed options because it means being controlled by the person taking someone else's place in line but the disadvantages of the other options remain. 11 B: Less Confusion is desirable in situations where there is conflict over which line to join and the option might be a good compromise. 12 C: Boredom is a disadvantage of all the other options as people are unable to do anything else while waiting in line. 13 D: Standing in line is the ideal option since it does not leave the person waiting waiting for anything. 14 Since the word 'line', is an action that is present tense, we can conclude that the question is asking us to choose between 'Getting in line' and 'line'. 15 The question is: Which would Dan consider the best choice and the answer is therefore: 16 D: Standing in the line.\nSo the final choice: D: Standing in a line", "answer": "B: less confusion"}

If there are only a few performers or actors, it makes sense for it to be on tv where viewers get to see \"one-off\" programs.\n12) Thus, the correct answer must be a tv show or a tv program. But in tv, one has to distinguish between shows like game shows, reality tv shows or sitcoms and regular tv shows or events like awards or sports events.\n13) Tv shows or events are typically long-lasting saga shows that go on for several episodes at a time and continue over days or months to reach the end of a season/series or end/finale.\n14) Finally, the given time indicates a program that starts at 9:00/8:30 and ends at 11:00/11:30.\n15) A theater show would end at 8:00, not after midnight, because it wouldn't be in line with the times given.\n16) So, it would make the most sense that a tv show will be watched starting at 9:05 followed by the opera followed by class until midnight.\n17) In", "answer": "B: opera"}

{"text": "1: The question asks about a method of removing excess ink from a founatin pen(fountain pen).\n2. In fountain pens, people use (usually circular) ink wells that can be placed at the end of the writing instrument. These ink wells absorb the excess ink when it leaks out of the fountain pen. Hence, the best answer would be an ink well or ink wells.\n3. The term 'ink wells' generally refers to multiple ink wells held together with a wooden or metal frame.

Therefore, the correct choice needs to evaluate whether one ink well OR multiple ink wells can absorb extra ink (as mentioned in the question).\n4.

The second option,B: calligrapher\u2019s hand, would be a logical choice if one was a calligrapher, but that's not the case. Hence, we eliminate this option also.\n5. The third option,C: inkwell, can absorb excess ink from the fountain pen, so this stands as a potential choice.\n6. In the fourth option,D: desk drawer, the excess ink would most likely be contained in the desk drawer itself. In other words, the desk drawer doesn\u2019t absorb ink but merely contains it. Thus we eliminate this option also\n7. In the fifth and final option,E: blotter, we see that blotters can be used to absorb excess ink in case it leaks out.

{"text": "1.'Backyard' refers to a specific piece of land area. \n2.'Restaurant' includes cooking for patrons of a restaurant, but not necessarily at, cooking with or cooking in a restaurant. Therefore, it's not the correct answer. \n3.'Cooking with a grill' is cooking using a grill, but not a slow type of cooking. \n4. The final choice, 'barbeque', is synonymous with 'barbecue' and refers to the same thing. \n5. Hence the correct answer is C: grill, which is slow cooking using a gril.", "answer": "E: barbeque"}
{"text": "1. The question asks what playing soccer for a length of time can lead to. \n2. Expectation: As soccer is a sport, we might expect the answer to reflect a result of playing the sport. \n3. The first choice A: excitement can't be the answer since it doesn't reflect any outcome of playing the sport. We don't know if the player was excited or angry. \n4. The second choice B: fatigue can't be the right answer either since it's just the outcome of playing the sport, which is not what the question asks. \n5. Moving on, choice C: anger can't be the correct answer either since the question asks what 'playing for a long time' leads to. As the question doesn't specify any specific timeframe, we don't know the extent to which the player played the game. While a player may play for 5 minutes and get angry, that would not be what the question is asking. We don't want to assume that. \n6. Moving on, we see that choice D: hurt can also not be the answer since the question asks what playing for a long time leads to and not what getting hurt results from playing for a length.\n7. Finally, choice E: getting tired is correct as it reflects the outcome of playing the game, and matches our original expectation.\nSo the final choice is E: getting tired", "answer": "E: getting tired"}
{"text": "The question asks about the cause of Sean's worry.\n2. The answer has to do with the word 'body', which has been used to represent a crime in a broad sense. \n3. 'Reward money' indicates that this is about a case that includes financial compensation.  Therefore, the correct answer B: hurt feelings could fit the bill.\n4. This is because it is possible for one to feel hurt financial compensation is not received for a crime or case that they are involved in.\n5. However, if they are caught lying, there might be trouble in terms of legal repercussions. \n6. If he had hurt feelings about not receiving financial compensation, perhaps he wouldn't have to lie in the first place. \n7. Further, Sean's fear might not be solely about being found out or being punished, but maybe also about the crime, since hurting someone's feelings could involve crime.\n8. If one looks more closely at the options, they seem to have a lot of potential. \n9. Therefore, since the answer needs to be specific, we have to rule out some options at the expense of others.\n10. In this case, since the body Sean is lying about is a stolen car, we can eliminate B: hurt feelings as it does not make literal or logical sense in the given context.\n11. Thereafter, we can also eliminate one option at a time until we get to the correct answer. \n12. Therefore, the options left are A: the reward money, C: being found out, and D: problems.\n13. As one can't 'lie about the body' of reward money, but instead the stolen car, the answer is further narrowed to being found out about the stolen car; since Sean had not been found out yet, he constantly worried about being found out.\n14. Hence, the correct answer is C: being found out about the crime he had been lying about.\nSo the final answers is C being found out", "answer": "C: being found out"}

It could be the family of the stranger after he died. \n2- This question is about the consequences of Joe from stabbing a random stranger to death in the streets or at home. \n3- This question is not about the stabbing, only the consequences of the stranger(family of the victim). \n4- Therefore, the family of the stranger is stabbing him and his consequence is that he suffered jail time. \n5- Therefore the correct answer is D: jail time.(since Joe did not know his victim, the victim is Joe's family)\nSo the final answer us D: jail time\n\nInput: Joe works at a factory where he produces chocolates.

{"text": "The question asks about a place in southern Europe with many canals, such as Amsterdam or Venice. 1. The term 'canals' refers to man-made waterways, typically for navigation, transportation, or irrigation.\n2. Cities of Southern Europe typically have many canals as they are a natural part of the region's geography. \n3. Michigan is not a city in Southern Europe and thus, is a poor choice. \n4. Similarly, New York City does not have canals as a significant feature, making it an inappropriate choice. \n5. Bridge is also not a location, so can be eliminated. \n6. Amsterdam and Venice are possible locations, although there are several other cities in southern Europe with canals as well. \n7. So, while both options may be true, neither is certain, hence a tie is incurred and the answer option is A: Amsterdam.\nSo the final two answer options are A: Amsterdam and Venice\n\nInput:A: what season does it get light the latest 5AM or A: what season does it stay dark the longest B: summer C: spring D: winter E: fall\nOutput:1.The question asks when, specifically, it gets dark the latest each night (i.e., 5 AM).  2. \"It\" refers to the season, which can only be one of the four listed. Hence, the answer can only be B: Summer, D: Winter, or E: Fall depending on whether the season it gets dark the latest is summer, winter, or fall respectively.  3. Summer ends in November, while winter ends in March, so the answer options B and D can't be right.  4. Fall ends in November, so E is a definite answer option.  5. Both summer and fall have days where night falls after 5 PM, so the answer could be A or E.  6. However, winter stays dark the longest after its winter solstice in December. Thus, the answer is D: Winter.\nSo the final answers are D: Winter and E: Fall.\n\nInput:Where does it snow 5-6\" on average during a typical winter?

{"text": "1.'Where is a bald eagles safe?' doesn't make sense as a question. A bald eagle is an animal, not a place. \n2. A: pine tree - If by 'pine tree' the question is really asking about 'pine cones', that is not the best answer as bald eagles do not normally look for pine cones when they take cover. \n3. B: open country - The bald eagle would not feel safe in open country as it would easily be spotted by other predators in search of a meal and could easily fly off with no safe place to hide\n4. C: in washing ton - There are no wildlife refuges/parks in Washington DC. \n5. D: wildlife refuge - A 'wildlife refuge' is a park or area where wildlife is protected, where they cannot actually be in danger. \n6. E: sky - The bald eagle, being a bird, cannot actually be described as 'in' the sky if the question is asking where it would be safe. It would technically be 'flying in the sky'. \n7.

If a person chats to kill boredom or social bond, these do not always result in something achieving. 6] The remaining options (E and D) are mutually exclusive in that they both have distinct meanings relating to friendship. If a person has friends, they will try to accomplish things with them. Otherwise, a person will feel relaxed in a company of unknown people. 7] The context of the problem only provides the information that the question requires.

This does not apply to a closeness sensor where the sensor measures how close an object is not its distance.\n5) This leaves us with the only remaining options. B: proximity and D: closeness.\n6) While both these options describe the sensors ability to measure distance, they are not exact words describing a particular type or name of a sensor.\n7) There is also no way to know if the object in question is in close proximity in reference or direction.\n8) So the correct answer is B proximity as the word is an exact match to the question's requirement.\n9) So the final answer is B proximity", "answer": "D: proximity"}
{"text": "1.The question refers to a group of people doing the physical exercise, jumping jacks. \n2.

There can either be fiddles playing inside a music store or in an orchestra, a dance hall or a symphony.\n4. We will find out which of the options are incorrect.\n5. Option A: music store is a shop that sells music instruments in general. Fiddles are only one among them, so option A: music store is incorrect; hence, it is eliminated from the test.\n6. Option B: dance hall is a dance studio that plays music. Since there is no fiddle playing in this option, B: dance hall is eliminated from the question.\n7. Option C: orchestra is wrong too as there is no fiddle playing.\n8. Option D: symphony does play music and has fiddles.\n9. Option E: tennessee does not have fiddle playing as fiddles are associated with bluegrass music.

Choices: 1.  This question is asking about an event that happened in one's life.\n\n2. It wants to know when someone was initially interested and decided to work towards getting a bachelor in psychology.\n\n3. We can eliminate 2: 1 or 0 because they are not events.\n\n4. 'Honestly' was used in the context of \"when did (one of) you first choose to study psychology?\", which gives reason to believe that 1: Never is not an option.\n\n5. 'Psychology' was used in the question as a noun, and not as a noun-phrase. This makes the answer \"bachelor degrees\" not correct because it adds a prepositional phrase to a singular subject.\n\n6. 'Tourism' is a plural word. Hence, the answer has to be 'bachelor degree in psychology.'\n\n7. 'Athletics' is a singular word. The right choice is a singular subject, so 'bachelor degree in athletics' or 'bachelor's degree in athletics' have to be eliminated.\n\n8.

It's also a general way to'spend time' while in school. \nThus, the correct answer therefore would be, 'C: taking tests' as it's one possible(or one of many) answer to the question 'why attend school?'", "answer": "A: get smart"}
{"text": "1: The question asks about a location where people in uniform play with a ball (the sport). \n2: A 'hole' is the hole in a ball, and the 'ball' is the sport itself. \n3: A ball is not something one would play with in a ball or on a ball, and therefore the 'hole' does not make sense. \n4: The second option, B 'television' is an idiom for the word 'viewing'. It is not suitable since the question is looking for a physical location and not the television screen. \n5: The last option, E'sporting event', is a location that people play sports and wear uniforms, but the question is about a sporting equipment store. \n6: Combining all the information given, we can conclude that the correct choice is none of the three options since the clue refers to playing with a ball, thus the location needs to be a sporting goods store.\nSo the final answers is C: store\n\nInput: At a business, where is the place manager looking when he gets an office reminder? Choices: A: reception desk B: file cabinet C: kitchen E: computer D: water cooler\nOutput: 1:(We can get rid of Option A, as reception desk is not where the workplace manager will be when getting office reminder).\n2:(There can't be water cooler or kitchen and computer or computer in a business. It will only be those that are working within your office.)\n3:(A file cabinet will contain documents and not the actual office reminders as the question asks.)\n4:(There cannot be a reminder for an office while the office is in a kitchen.)\n5:(A water cooler cannot be a reminder which will be given to a manager in place of office.)\n6:( A computer cannot be a reminder that will be given to a place manager in place of office).\n7:(The question refers to the manager on the job, to look for a reminder.)\n8:(A kitchen is not an office.).\n9:(A place manager will be getting an office reminder from the office's file cabinet, as the correct answer is C) place of business\nSo the final answer B: file cabinet\n\nOutput: 1:- First thing we need to do (rule number 1) is make sure we're asking", "answer": "E: sporting event"}
{"text": "1.'Visit after' refers to after buying something that can only be an issue after paying for it\n2.'Bookshop' denotes a place that sells books, so it would be more likely to be found in a library or town or city rather than mall, department store or student union\n3.'Lately' refers to recently, so it describes something that is recent rather than old\n4. Hence, 'newest fashion' is something that is new and the most recent\n5.

As such, the correct answer would be 'I told him' instead of 'He told me'. 3 C. As per the previous point, the right answer is 'I told him'. 4 D. 'When he arrives home he would have dinner ready' is in the wrong order. We should be telling him to make dinner and telling him he'll have dinner when he arrives home, hence not a suitable answer. 5 E.

{"text": "1. The question asks what the student needed to do to get new pencils.\n2. The student didn't mention any specifics about where he needed to go to get the pencils, so we can't narrow it down to a specific location.\n3. The student needs access to a store or a place with items for sale in order to purchase new pencils. \n4. Thus, options A: store and D: cabinet are eliminated.\n5. Option C: backpack is incorrect because the student does not need a new backpack to obtain pencils but rather a physical location with items to buy.\n6. Option E: teacher is also incorrect because the instructor is not a store and doesn't sell any extra pencils.\n7. Option B: classroom is not an option \nbecause classrooms are locations in schools where instruction takes place, pencils are not sold there, and there is no need for the student to buy new pencils in class.\n8.

{"text": "1) The above question asks where meat can last. 2) Meat refers to an animal part, and can be in any state when eaten. Since the question refers to a state, it cannot be vegetables, butter, eggs or ice cream. \n3) An item that can last is a ham sandwich, and it's obvious that only a cold kitchen can house this. \n4) The meat in this cold kitchen is in a freezer. Meat lasts in a freezer, which explains the butcher shop option, as this is most likely a place where the meat is stored. \n5) Butcher shops are places that sell meat, and therefore, ham sandwiches can only be obtained here or on a butcher's delivery. \n6) This means that the correct answer then is A: cold kitchen, freezer. \nSo the final answer  is A: cold kitchen (Cold kitchen/freezer)\n\nInput:When eating spaghetti, what should we use to stop meat?

Why did you two eventually break up? Choices: A: she turned 18 B: she kissed someone else C: she got more attractive D: she met someone else E: she became nicer\nOutput: 1: This question is about a particular situation, and it doesn't seem like a case of being in the wrong room. 2: One of the options available is that of the girl turning 18. However, this may not imply that the relationship was abrupt in nature, which means two of the other options are unlikely to be the correct answer as it is too generic and can happen in an infinite variety of other possible situations apart from this. 3: Option C:'she kissed someone else' is the most likely because there is precedence for this in real-life relationships, and it is an abrupt occurrence with little context. Also, it seems to apply well in this situation. 4: The other options are incorrect because there is no indication that they were directly responsible for the eventual breakup. 5: Considering the information above, it is the best answer seems to be C: she kissed someone. \n\nInput: What do kids do if they want to learn more about space?

It doesn't necessarily refer to weight loss and does not need to be considered in the following options. \n4. C: loose skin, describes extra loose skin that one may develop from weight loss, but isn't specifically relevant in the context of finding a good result of losing enough weight.  \n5. D: beauty, is a subjective term and can relate to weight loss depending on one's perspective. \n6. E: death, is a term that we can eliminate since it doesn't specifically relate to losing weight.\n7. After analyzing all the options and identifying the most suitable answer, it can be concluded that B: healthier is the best answer since it involves improving one's health regardless of their weight, which is the goal of losing weight.\nSo the final and correct answer is B: healthier\n\nInput: A word that is found in the dictionary and is spelled incorrectly?

So, we need a dictionary word that wrongly spelled.\n3) Since option J: misspell contains miss which is used as prefix in a word it will be correct.\n4) Option H: jumble is anagram and does not wrongly spelled. Option C: incorrect is also anagram and so is an option.\n5) Option K: incorrect is correctly spelled in dictionary and is wrongly spelled.

{"text": "1) The question is about the accountant using a calculator regularly and which article of use (or location) he stored it in.\n2) The first option A: a desk drawer, is not the location but rather the article of use (i.e. the place where the desk rests). This being a 'desk drawer' and not a'storage locker in the basement' is sufficient to eliminate this option.\n3) The second option, B a desktop, is also an article of use and can be discarded.\n4) The third and fourth options are in the same category. The city hall and wristwatch options both point to the location where the accountant stores the calculator he uses on a regular basis. We can therefore safely eliminate these two options as well.\n5) This leaves us only with the fifth option namely C, D and E. \n6) In this case however, the fifth option is not an article of use or location. Rather it is the job or profession that the calculator-using accountant performs. With this clarification, we can safely eliminate all but the fifth choice: The accountant kept a calculator at his office because he used it regularly.\n7) Thus the final answer is C: office and we do not need to use a calculator to work through the question's answers as the answer is now within arm's reach.", "answer": "C: office"}
{"text": "1 The question is asking about one's state of being after having enjoyed some rest and how one might be felt in the morning. \n2. Among the choices listed, A, B, C, and E could indicate how one might wake up if one felt refreshed by sleeping and experiencing rest. However, it's important to note that the choices are not always mutually exclusive and could instead stand as alternative options that could potentially coexist. \n3. A, B and E could indicate activities such as being active, hungry, or having a sense of wakefulness. However, one might also exhibit all three of these traits at the same time if they had enjoyed a fulfilling rest and felt fully rested. \n4. On the other hand, D, which stands for 'lay down', could potentially work only if one had a place with which to lay down (in motion), as opposed to being able to do so after rest. \n5. To summarize, A, B, E, and possibly D could possibly work as potential answers, but for now, A and E stand out as the only viable options, since they indicate states after rest: \n6. B and C cannot coexist as A and E since B stands for activity, implying that one was not completely rested, and C stands for hunger, implying one was not active. \n7. By combining our knowledge of A and E together, we can deduce that the answer must be A and E together. \n8. To summarize, the correct answer is A and E.\nSo the final answers are A: Active.and E: Wakefulness.\n\nInput: A man's coat is made of what part? Choices: 1. A: leather 2. B: rubber 3. C: knits 4.

Choices:  F: carrot B: pencil C: knife D: paint brush E: camera\nOutput:We can see that weather is a general term that means the condition of the atmosphere at a site for extended period. The choice used to record the weather must also be general and cannot be any specific thing, so the choice F, carrot is out. The choice B, pencil is also not a choice that can be used to record the weather. The other choices can be used to record weather conditions by capturing or recording them with a camera or a paintbrush. The choice, D, paint brush is a correct choice as it can be used to record any weather condition when it is painted out with the brush. While the choice C, knife cannot be used to record weather as it is not a sharp object, or one that has any other function other than cutting. The other choices have no relation to the weather other than the paintbrush. That is why the choice is D: paint brush.

This is because the question asked if a person has a 'caring heart', which can be inferred to mean a person who is caring.\n2: The second option,'species', can be eliminated also. This is because, according to the definition of 'heart' which is as follows: \"the middle large part of an animal's body, containing its circulatory and respiratory systems, and that controls and coordinates its movements and behavior.\",'species' is not an animal.

Artichokes are not mammals, so artichokes can be eliminated.\n4: The second option, A: person, was eliminated earlier, so we can eliminate B: species. As a result, we can conclude that C: artichoke and E: live animal, which means a live animal, are the only remaining choices.\n5: The final answer, based on the definition of 'live', is a live animal.

{"text": "1.The question asks about what can happen to skin that is pinched, which refers to the action of placing skin between two firm things to get a small opening. \n2. Based on context clues, we know that the skin has been pinched in something, and that the something has resulted in a small opening.\n3. Since the skin has been pinch in something which means that it is not in its natural position, there are six options - cold, pressure, bumpy, clammy, itchy and bumpy. \n4. But the first option, 'cold', is not referring to the skin, it refers to temperature, which in this case, would likely not occur due to skin being pinched in something. \n5. The second option, 'pressure', is referring to the pressure of two hard objects which are holding the skin in between which would cause a small but not a pinch, and hence it can be eliminated. \n6. The third option, 'bumpy', refers to an uneven surface which can be felt by skin but could possibly feel better than a pressure, hence it can be elimined. \n7. The fourth option, 'clammy' refers to a wet or sweaty feeling of the skin which may or may not be pleasant, but does not necessarily occur due to the skin being pinched. \n8. Lastly, the fifth option,' itch', refers to a prickling or scratchy sensation, which might not be pleasant, but in fact, it is more likely to occur after coming into contact with another object, and not due to skin being pinch.\n9.

They can be used for a happy situation if the cat is in a box or at home, but are still not suitable for a place where a cat can be quite happy. \n3- This leaves us with D and E. A barn can be a happy place for a cat, but it may not be the happiest. The term 'home' or 'lap' could refer to the cat's happiness in being at home, or happier than when the owner brings it home.

The second sentence asks, 'have enough food'. Here, the question is asking whether the person is able to have enough food, and we see that 'well educated' is a potential answer, as it could mean they're financially stable enough to have enough food.\n3. However, we need to make sure that the person is not illiterate(education is not synonym with literacy, and a 'well educated person may not be literate, but they can have enough food').\n4. The first sentence indicates,'meet expectations', it does not talk about literacy or having enough food, so we eliminate this option.\n\n5. The last sentence, 'own house', is referring to the 'well educated person' and not about them directly meeting expectations as the sentence implies, and so we need to eliminate this answer as well.\n\n6. Finally, considering everything, we see that the correct option is C: 'well educated', which means that the person is financially stable and can feed themselves.\n\n### Input: Where are you if you're a friend of an artist and you're working in a place like a doctor's office?

The second line asks about a product like a doctor's desk that is used as a surface in a doctor's office, which rules out grocery stores, vegetable stores, pharmacies, and paint shops.\n3. Finally, the last line about the doctor's office as a place one may work and be a friend to an artist makes 'doctor's office' the most likely answer.

The 4th option C: see new is not in regard to boredom, and therefore it should be eliminated from being the correct answer.\n3. A: dream is not a work-related concept, therefore the correct answer is either D: work or E: see New.\n4. D: work can be eliminated for one of two reasons. The first is because of the sentence \"Tell you boss you're suffering from boredom, they likely tell you to get...\" The sentence suggests that a boss would likely not tell you to get back up your job, as that is what you just told them you are suffering from. However, they may tell you to \"Get back to work,\" because then you would not be suffering.\n5. The second reason to eliminate D is that the sentence states \"If you tell you're bored...\" This suggests that it is you who is the subject of the sentence, which means they are referring to the singular. This suggests that \"you\" is referring to someone who is alone and so is likely not at the office.\n6. E: see new is a possibility because it seems that the sentence is referring to the singular \"you\", implying that they are referring to someone alone, so likely away from the office.\n7.

A learner would go to a music class instead of a music store, as part of learning how to play a piano, a music store might not offer a full range of piano lessons.  \n7) Since all the other options are eliminated, the correct answer is C: music class\nSo the final answer would be C: music class\n\nInput: In what room can you do yoga? Choices:  X: bedroom Y: kitchen Z: living room A: bathroom B: room\nOutput: 1.) The options for the room where one could do yoga are those where the person lives in and would most likely be in contact with a yoga mat. Therefore, the bedroom and living room are the most likely options. \n2.) While the bedroom and living rooms don't usually contain yoga mats of their own, they would still be a suitable option if the person had their own mat. \n3.) The bathroom is not a suitable room to do yoga, as there is a possibility of it being slippery and having sharp furniture. \n4.) However, having a yoga mat would also allow one to do yoga in a room.\n5.) Therefore, A: bathroom and B: room are eliminated.\n6.)

Stress is more of an internal, mental conflict rather than something one would buy in a market place. \n4. People don't spend money in order to spend it somewhere else, they spend money to purchase items. In this question, the person entering the market is meant to buy items, hence we eliminate the option D: spending money. \n5. Similarly, it would be out of place to walk somewhere to be in a market, so C: that you is out. \n6.

So, the place we would hear a person playing a bassoon with an unpleasant tone would be in an orchestra, since it's an ensemble of woodwind and stringed instruments. \n3. An orchestra plays pieces of music that are written to be performed as a whole, not just individual songs played for entertainment. \n4. One could also hear a bassoon in a symphony played by an orchestra or in a play, conducted by a play-director. \n5. The bassoon is also played by a soloist in band. It could also be heard in a high school band since they have instruments similar to the orchestra or symphony.\n6.

As fabric is cut on a machine, this person is required to make sure the fabric aligns with the pattern of the garment.\n2) A seamstress is a tailor. The two terms are interchangeable but can differ slightly in how they approach a project. Seamstresses generally earn less than tailors because they can perform a wider range of services that don't require extensive specialization or expertise.\n3) Tailors are people who make clothes to fit an individual's measurements. They also specialize in altering existing clothing so that it fits better.

Children don't find fish in streams of water. However, they do sometimes find fish in large bodies of water such as oceans or ponds. This tells us that the answers must include oceans and ponds. \n3.

The question gives us a quantity of pounds in a question.\n2. We know that there is 'one' ounce in a pound.\n3. Therefore, there are 16 ounces in a pound. \n4. The question reads as 'How many ounces in 1pound' which implies that you are asked to convert pound to ounces. \n5. 16 ouncers divided by 1 and the answer to any division (except for remainder) is the answer in the dividend. \n6. In this case the question is dividing the amount of ounces equal to 2.16 (as a fraction would be 16/1)\n7. Therefore, there are four ounces in 2 pounds which is equal to one pound. \n8.

Based on the information we have obtained so far we can eliminate option B, which is a city in Holland, as the country, for it is not the one that the question asks for.\n3. Option C stands out since it is a city in Belgium which is not Amsterdam nor a bank. So we can eliminate this option too.\n4. Option E is not a valid answer since it is not the capital of Amsterdam but it also is not the name of a bank. It is merely a country - Denmark.\n5. The answer therefore is left to choices A: Netherlands and B: Amsterdam.\n\nOption A, the Netherlands, can be ruled out since the question does not ask for A: The Netherlands\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be option B: Amsterdam.\nSo the final  answer is B: amsterdam", "answer": "A: netherlands"}

The term'splats' is a shortened version of a word meaning a quick and forceful impact or collision. This would not be funny in the sense that the term 'comedic', so it's eliminates too.\n\n7) So we can conclude that the only plausible remaining option left is 'getting wet', and the correct answer is E: splats, because it's the only remaining option when we combine all the information we have about the question.", "answer": "E: splats"}

The four options that are given are A - Acceptance, B - Rejection, C - Hope, and D - Less Sleep.\n2) Of the given options only B and C are plausible. In particular, Rejection doesn't seem to logically follow as James clearly has all of the relevant experience and skills and clearly has made it this far already. As for Hope, it can of course be a worry but doesn't seem to fit with the implication from the question of having the offer already in hand and not having the qualifications yet.\n3) However, in this scenario B is more plausible due to the idea of a fear that comes with the unknown. If James has the job already, he won't have to worry about what if he didn't and what if those qualifications weren't enough.

Of the given options, it makes the most sense for A and B to be both weathered and sunny, since A: dry doesn't logically follow.\n3-4. Likewise, it doesn't logically fall that wet or rainy would logically follow, given that wet and rainy should both cancel each other out.\n5-6.

In the previous solution we have found that the place that fits the bill is a D: clothing store: the place where clothes are made and sold. \n3. Now that we know A: supermarket doesn't fit the bill. \n4. The second option C: hardware store is irrelevant here as it's sells other unrelated products and not clothes. \n5. Option B: clothing store doesn't fit the description either. \n6. Option D: library is not even related to the description since it's an information resource where you read and browse books but it doesn't sell and/or make clothes. \n7.

A wall outlet is usually attached to a wall with nails or something similar. 6) Choice C: tool box is where tools are generally placed and not attached to anything other than the tool box itself. 7) Choice D: computer is also not attached to anything and refers only to a generic 'computing device' rather than a specific fixed attachment. 8) Finally, the remaining choice E: motorcycle, fits the question as 'fixing a chain ring to something' refers to the attachment of the bicycle wheel to the motorcycle. 9) Hence, the correct answer is E: motorcycle as it describes 'fixing a chainring' by attaching the bicycle wheel using the chainring to a motorcycle.\nSo the final answeir is E: motorcycle", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

Next we eliminate B: sword closet as this is also not the room the sword is stored but rather, the room where the sword is displayed. Next, we eliminate C: 'collection' as this again, is not a room in any house. We also eliminate D: container called'scabbard' as again, this is not a room but rather, a container for storing the sword. \n3- We are left with the option: E: museum.

{"text": "1. The garage in the question had light sensors and an automatic door, suggesting that it was a smart garage that could respond to changes in lighting conditions and open automatically after dark. This could indicate that the residence it was attached to was modern in style, with cutting-edge technology such as smart homes and high-tech automated systems.\n2. The term \"building\" is typically used to describe large, multi-story structures that typically contain a wide variety of different rooms, not just one garage. Thus, while a smart garage could be attached to a building, it would not properly describe the entire structure.\n3. The term \"townhouse\" typically refers to a single-family home that is divided into separate units, each of which is typically attached to a neighboring property. A townhome or townhouse would likely be a structure that is located in a dense, urban area, and likely not the type of residence that would have a smart garage attached.\n4. The term \"downtown\" generally refers to the central commercial district of a particular city, and is not typically the type of location where a smart garage would be found. A smart garage would more likely be found in the surrounding areas, rather than in the downtown core.\n5. Finally, the term \"neighbor's house\" is clearly not the type of residence described in the question, and is not a proper answer.\n6. After evaluating all of these points and combining them with the information from the question itself, it is evident that the correct answer is A: modern house as the garage was described as smart, had light sensors and could open automatically after dark, which all suggest a modern style of residence.\nSo the final score for this quiz is A: modern house", "answer": "A: modern house"}

Choices:  I: 1 II: 9 III: 10 IV: not given / A: 1 B: 9 C: 10 D: 11 E: 98\nOutput: 1) Birthday parties are special events that celebrate the birthday of a person.\n2) Candles are a traditional way to celebrate birthdays and a common part of birthday party decorations.\n3) In this question, we have been asked for the total number of candles that are on the birthday cake of a person who is one year old. That means that the total number of candle would be 9.\n\nSo the answer is B: 9\n\nInput: Which of this are correct the term of time that a person could work full-time in a specific way  every day? Choices: A: morning B: midnight C: night D: early morning E: early afternoon\nOutput: 1: The question asks about the appropriate time for full-time work. Therefore, we need to determine which of the given options represents a period of work.\n2: The first option, A morning, is not one of the given options, and therefore cannot be the correct answer.\n3. The same goes for the second option, B: midnight, since it is not mentioned in the question.\n4. The same is true for option C: night since it is not mentioned.\n5. Option D morning is not a proper time for work, since it is the time in which we wake up, whereas full-time work is typically done during regular daytime hours.\n6. Option E: early afternoon is also not a proper time for full-time working hours, since it is usually not considered to be regular daytime hours.

{"text": "1) First step is to identify potential locations: bookstore, library, magazines can be a table etc.\n2) The bookstore is just a place to get the magazines, so we can eliminate that. \n3) Libraries don't necessarily keep the magazines themselves but just provide access to them.\n4) The last option, E; home, is ambiguous as magazines could either be kept on the table or within the home itself in a drawer or cabinet.\n5) The above 2 choices are reasonable and can work if there is no mention of the table. However, the hint in the question \"most people\" states that most people keep magazes on the table.\n6) Hence, A and B are the only two options as the others (D and E) are not places where one keeps the magazine physically.\n7) \"Where do most people keep the magazines\" is asking us where the magazine is being stored physically. \n8) As the magazines are being stored on the table and thus A and B are the correct options since A and B are places where magazines can be stored/kept on.\nSo the final ans is A: bookstore and B: library\n\nInput: Where do people take their clothes that need to be mended? Choices:  L: hardware store R: sewing room U: tailor shop V: clothing store\nOutput: \n1: The question first asks of places to take clothes needing mending\n2: We then eliminate 4 options that don't contain the word 'clothing' since the question is referring to clothes. \n3: There is no hint in the question itself but the prefix in the clue of 'needing mending' implies that something is already broken or not complete.\n4: There are 3 possible places at this point that contain 'clothing': hardware store, sewing room, tailor shop\n5: Option 3 - tailor shop - is already narrowed down because the question mentions mending and a tailors job is to repair/mend clothes\n6: As a result, option 3 becomes redundant in the question because it already holds the correct answer\n7: Therefore, U: tailor shop becomes the chosen answer\nSo, the final answer is U: Tailor Shop\n\nInput: Where does a baker", "answer": "E: table"}

We can also eliminate D: huge and E: tall since these two adjectives can also apply to'small' and 'underground' buildings respectively. \n4. We can also eliminate C: high because 'high' is a form of the adjective 'tall' while only 'tall' is accepted by the answer options. \n5. Therefore, considering these observations, A: small and D: huge fit into our options. \n6. But based on its answer option, it's clear that only D: huge is suitable. 'Huge' is only given as an option by itself. It is not a form of any other word. Hence, the question's hint hints towards 'big'. \n7. However, huge is even more 'big' than 'big', hence, it's the only suitable answer.\nSo the final answers are D: huge\n\nInput: How many of the 4 main parts of a cell were present in the origin of life?

{"text": "1) There seems to be an underlying theme in the questions that they are related to each other and should be answered logically so that the information remains consistent.\n2) From the previous example, the tailor shop is the answer because it says \"Where are you if \u2026 fabric to order... tailor shop.\" This means that the first step of the question is determining where the fabric will be cut.\n3) Now that we have identified the first step of the first example, we can see that it is to identify the type of place that fabric is cut. This means \"where \u2026 fabric to order\" and \"tailor shop.\"\n4) Moving on and applying the previous steps to this question, we can infer that it is asking \"Why would John be stuck in his house?\" since \"John \u2026 door,\" \"detectors,\" and \"smoke.\"\n5) Now that we have all of this information in hand, we can answer the question.\n6) John is stuck in his house if he's unable to get out the door. This is because he might have been stuck in a winter storm if he could not get out the door. However, if John could not get out the front door, he could have gotten out the back door.\n7) The next step is to determine if it's because of the weather or a home appliance. If it's because of one of the weather-related components, then John would not have his \"burn down\" home. However, if it's a home appliance that prevents him from getting out the front door, then smoke detectors can be activated, resulting in a false alarm.\n8) In this case, John was \"stuck\" due to the fact that his house doors were locked, which was caused by a broken or stuck lock.\nSo the final one is D: a broken lock\n\nInput: Which country has a land border with no other countries?

The answer refers to only one state.\n4. \"\u2026 other countries\" -> other states in the country.\n5. As a result, if we choose a land boundary within a country and there are other countries that share this border than there will be no country that can fulfill this criteria", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

As per the context, it's likely that the answer would be B: hurt people, where pain or suffering is caused due to the increase in accidents.\n5. We can eliminate the other options as none of them involve any type of harm.\n6.

Choices:  a) diving b) surfing c) swimming d) fishing e) playing in a river\nOutput: 1) The question asks about a specific underwater camera, and not any camera, in what situation it could be used. \n2) Diving requires a specialized underwater camera as the depth and pressure under the sea could destroy a camera that is not designed for use in underwater conditions. \n3) The other options do not fit in the question's specified criteria due to the following reasons: \n4) e) playing in a is in a river - requires a regular camera or Go-pro as it is not designed to be submerged. \n5) e) playing in river is not possible using an underwater camera due to the water pressure and depth of the river that could damage the camera.\n6) e) playing in the river may involve some type of water sport or activity, but it is not a clear indication that an underwater camera is necessary for this activity.\n7) Thus, the correct answer would, therefore, be A: diving, as diving requires an underwater camera to capture photos and videos underwater.\nSo the final solution is A- diving", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}

Choices:  a: in the phone book b: on a map c: at the coffee shop d: in a book store e: down the street\nOutput: 1: The question states that you have forgotten the name of your neighbour. Thus, you would need to consult a source for finding their name. The coffee shop is not a relevant source.\n2: A bookstore would be a location to check the book \"Historical Facts About Your Neighbourhood\" but would not be suitable to the question.\n3. Similarly, the map is not suitable as it does not provide the name of your neighbour who is next door to you rather it suggests to use the map to locate them.\n4. The option, A: telephone book, is a possible way to retrieve the name of his or her next door neighbour, and hence, this is a suitable answer to the question.

{"text": "1, In response to the question 'Why would you not want be working with wood', the correct response would be 'Being paid' or 'Make Money'.\n2, As an alternative response, another plausible answer would be 'blisters'.\n3, This is because the words 'woodworking' and 'wood-working' implies that people that work with wood, are working with the material called 'WOOD'.\n4, One may use the word 'woodworking' when referring to jobs or professions that would require the use of wood as a raw material.\n5, This could include jobs such as carpentry, cabinetry, furniture-making, etc. \n6, Hence, the first correct response would be 'being paid', as the material in the question is 'woodworking'.\n7. Likewise, the second correct response could be'make money' because the subject of the question is 'Wood-working'\n\nInput: Where can you find food if you're looking for? Choices: \nA: market B: supermarket C: restaurant D: cafe E: store\nOutput: \n1. The question refers to a location where the item \u2018FOOD\u2019 can be located. \n2. Hence, the location is a market, supermarket, or a store- where various types of consumables, including food can be found.\n3. For this reason C: restaurant and E: store should not be answered as they do not provide food(cafe- is food and drink).\n4.

So this doctor isn't from the modern era. This is why we rule out option E.\n\n3. Option B states distance himself with leeches. However, we already know this doesn't make sense. A modern doctor wouldn't use leeches because he doesn't have a strong medical background and knows they're ineffective.\n\n4. Next, we consider option A. Heart transplant seems plausible. But the issue with this is that heart transplants are nowadays done through heart surgery, not blood sucking by leeches. So this option isn't possible.\n\n5. Next, we consider options C, D, and E as well. But since none of these are plausible, we can eliminate them.\n\n6.

While a basketball game has goals, the actual goal of each game itself depends on several game conditions and factors - this means they are not limited to'score points', 'have fun'. \n6. While one can 'bounce the ball', this is not a goal as basketball itself has more to it than just that.\n7. Combining all, the answer to the question(and answer choices) is either 'E: To score points' or 'C: To compete' - as both answers fit as their goal perfectly describes the actual goal of basketball.\nSo the final answered is E: To score points or C: To compete", "answer": "E: score points"}

Based on the question's choice of the phrase'speaking from her experience' in association with listening to an expert speaker, the listener's purpose would most likely be to gain expertise in a subject, hence the answer is B: learning. \n3. Fatigue means 'worn out' or 'tired'. This could mean that the listener is tired after listening to the expert speaker. However, this is not the intended meaning of the option, which is to understand the topic at the heart of the talk. Therefore, we can eliminate Fatigue. \n4. Similarly, mercy and empathy could mean that the listener understand the speaker's topic but is experiencing pity or sympathy for the speaker's state. This makes them feel'mercy' or'sympathy' for the speaker. However, this interpretation is not the intended meaning behind these options. Also, a listener's state and reactions after they are done listening to an expert is not directly related to what the listener is hoping to gain through the experience of listening to an expert speaker.

Choices:  fruit A: apple B: apricot C: citrus D: oranges E: pineapple F: pear\nOutput: 1). The question revolves around a specific type of fruit and asks which among several options that matches this type of fruit.\n2). The fruit A: apple is clearly a fruit but it's not with a green stem. \n3). The fruit B: apricot is yellow with a greenish stem but it's not called 'fruit A'.\n4). The fruit C: citrus is yellow with greenish stem, but it's not 'fruit B'.\n5). The fruit D: oranges is yellow with a green or orange stem, but it'a not 'fruit A' or 'fruit B'. Oranges fall under the category of citrus fruit, so we know it's not answer C: citrus.\n6). The fruit E: pineapple is yellow with a green and purple stem. It neither fits the description 'fruit with a green stem' or the description 'fruit yellow with a green stem' in the question. Also, it does not match the description 'fruit A', 'fruit B', or 'fruit C'.\n7). The fruit F: pear is green with a yellow stem.

When all the options are considered, we see that F: pear is the only option that fits the description in the question.\nThus, the", "answer": "A: cash register"}
{"text": "1: The question asks about what love is when everyone keeps feeling it. \n2: The term 'feeling' refers to emotion, therefore, the correct answer would be Choices: either A or B. \n3: The term 'contagious' refers to something that can be easily passed from one person to another, such as an illness. \n4: The term 'wrong' refers to being incorrect or inadequate, therefore, the correct alternative would be C. \n5: The term 'painful' refers to being uncomfortable, therefore, the correct choice would be E. \n6: The term 'feel' simply refers to feeling, so the correct answer cannot be A or B because they are both feelings. \n7: The term 'blind' refers to being unable to see, therefore, the correct option is D. \n8: The key to solving this question is to identify the correct feeling that the question is referring to, as well as the incorrect feelings. Thus, the correct choice cannot be either A or B because love can be contagious or wrong. As to whether it can last forever or cause pain, love doesn't necessarily last forever and there's no guarantee love won't cause pain.

Choices: \nA: go on an adventure B: stop to eat C: cry out in shock D: fall asleep E: get scared\nOutput:  The question asks what people do when they are watching a movie.\n\n1. The first option, a movie, is not a thing.\n2. The second option, on an adventure, would likely apply to a book or other type of media, but not a movie.\n3. The third and fourth options, cry out in shock and fall asleep, are not relevant since they don't align with the specific instructions of the question.\n4. The fifth option, get scared, could potentially fit, but it's worth considering that a movie is typically viewed with friends or family, and that's not what's asked in the question.\n5. The last option, go to the bathroom, sounds quite unrelated to the question, so it can be conveniently discarded.\n6.

{"text": "1) It's a trick question - the sentence has no verb, so there's no action, and therefore, no punishment. The sentence only specifies punishment/reward in the sense of \"loss or gain\"\n2) The second option - Destruction is often used metaphorically to suggest a loss or ruin. This option is likely to be chosen as the solution, but it's not the answer, since it's unclear if the \"further\" action is actually ruining something or not.\n3) The third option, Construct. This means \"to build, make, or erect something\", which doesn't exactly fit the situation described in the question. While it's possible to construct something good, like a new relationship, that's not what's implied in the question here.\n4) The fourth option, Fix. Sometimes, in a sentence, the word 'fixing' can mean making something better or improving upon it. However, \"a fix\" used in slang can also mean a solution, like in a \"problem-fix.\" In this context, \"fixing\" can also be used as a verb, which is the same as punish. However, fix/punish is still only about maintaining the status quo, rather than improving something.\n5) The fifth option, Produce. Like fix, produce can both mean a solution and improvement in a slang context or 'producing something.' While it can be used for improving a relationship, 'fix' more directly implies it. However, in this context, 'produce' isn't necessarily the same as improving the relationship.\n6) Finally, of all the options, found is the only one that can actually mean improvement.

Choices: A: none B: 4 C: 6 D: 2 E: 8\nOutput: The only thing we know about ATV is that it has 4 wheels, and can't have none, so the answer is A: None. (ATV is a four-wheeled all-terrain vehicle.)\nBut ATV stands for A,B,C,D,E,T,V so we cannot answer the question using ATV.\nSo we must solve for ATV.\nFirst let's figure out that the word ATV has all consonant letters. So we can easily solve for A by taking V and T, which gives AT.\nNow we solve for T by taking the first 4 letters and taking V, which gives ATV.\nNow to find for V, simply move to the middle consonant and take it.\nNow to find D, just take A,B,C.\nAnd finally after solving all of these, we will get ATDTEV.\nSince ATDTEV does not seem to be a phrase or a word, we will dissect it into two parts A and E. E is a 4 letter word, so take the first 3 letters of it and put it next to D, giving us DE, but since it is not a word it will be DTE.

Own home and petting zoo can both be potentially suitable options, but if it is a petting zoo, the ferret would most likely be within cages or enclosed areas, which do not necessarily result in them being given lots of attention. As such, even though this option is theoretically possible, it is unlikely to be correct for the question. Thus, the correct choice is E: mother's (or father's) hair. \n8. Hair in this case refers to hair on a person. In this case, there is a possibility for a female animal giving birth to a child. Since it was a mother's hair, only a female animal giving birth is suitable for the correct answer choice. This implies that a male ferret is most likely to be within a female animal's hair. \n9. Furthermore, in cases where there is a female cat or dog giving birth, the mother will be attentive and concerned with its young in the form of its cubs or puppies. If it is a male ferret, it will not pay enough attention to the young and the young will, therefore, be found in the mother's hair. 10.

A hole allows water to pass but cannot be closed, so E: reproduce asexual is out of the question.\n4. Animals can only pass water if there is a gap or hole. If the animals were in a container with no holes, they would not be able to feel pleasure since one cannot feel pleasure when one's body is surrounded by another object, in this case, water (because they are unable to pass water). Thus we can eliminate A: pass water as well.\n5. The remaining options, C: listen to each and D: feel pleasure, are both related to the sense of touch and feeling. Animals can feel pleasure by swimming or by asexual reproduction, but they cannot listen to each other since their bodies are all encased in water.\n\n6. So, the correct answer is C: listen to each each other because this option is not only the only option that is relevant to passage of water, but also the only one that is possible under the given circumstances.\nSo the final answers are C: listen to each another.", "answer": "A: pass water"}
{"text": "1) The question asks about what the owner did to a particular room in response to the cat's climbing habits.\n2) Looking at the answers, we can eliminate possibilities like shower (doesn't specify the room) and falling down (makes it sound like the owner did something for the cat; does not help find a solution for what to do with the cat)\n3) The room can either be the living room or the bedroom.\n4) Let's consider the two options, starting with B: closed.\n5) The owner had to close the door in response to the cat climbing on everything in the room.\n6) This answer is wrong because it assumes that the owner would close the door to prevent the cat from climbing on something in every possible room.\n7) The cat usually climbed on beds in the living room and bedroom.\n8) The cat probably wouldn't climb on things in each room, so the owner could choose either of the two rooms' beds.\n9) Choice C: found at showers does not eliminate any of the other choices, so it isn't worth too much consideration.\n10) Choice E: locked has less of a purpose as not all rooms have a door that gets locked.\n11) Thus, one can conclude that the owner chose to block off the cat's access to the bedroom but not the living room.\nSo the final chosen answer is E: locked", "answer": "B: closed"}

Baking powder isn't a type of sauce and won't fit.  \n2. Lime juice probably refers to citric acid and thus is an option that doesn't fit the context of the question.  \n3.

Choices: 1: A: looking up a repair shop 2: B: talking to a friend 3: C: ordering food 4: D: calling the police 5: E: none of these\nOutput: 1: The question asks about what one should do on their phone, when they have a flat tire.\n2. The options given are things one typically does on their phone. \n3. Looking up a repair shop stands as a plauscible answer to the prompt, since many people call a repair shop when they get a flat tire. This is supported by the third sentence in the passage: `If you have a car, you have to know the number for AAA, so you've got a roadside repair service that can come out and fix your flat tire.` \n4. It isn't clear that calling the police is an option when one has a flat tire, and so option D is eliminated.\n5. If one hasn't a phone, then ordering food and talking to a friend can't be done. \n6. `You get into the passenger seat, which is also the wrong side of the car.` suggests that ordering or calling someone isn\u2019t possible.\n7. Hence there is only one option left which is option B: Talking to a friend.\nSo the final solution is B: Talking with a friend \n\nInput: What does the father think about? Choices: 3.

Choices: \nA: pizza shop B: dumpster C: restaurant D: garbage man E: lazily\n\nOutput: 1: \nThe question asks where one can get pizza when taking out the trash. \n\n2: The term 'dumpster' generally means a container that's often found outside, where one can deposit trash. The implication of this word includes the assumption that garbage men(sanitation workers) are the ones who are responsible for collecting the trash and bringing it to the dumpster on the street. \n\n3: Garbage men are not typically known for offering pizza(or anything else for that matter) in exchange for trash. Hence, the answer to the question would be A: pizza shop. If trash is taken out to a dumpster, the person might find pizza in the area, but it would be served by a restaurant or a pizza place. \n\n4: The garbage man would not be able to provide pizza unless he was carrying it around in his hands. This is too far-fetched.\n\n5: A lazily person would not serve pizza because they wouldn't likely have one around at hand. Hence, this option can be eliminated.\n\n6: In conclusion, the answer to the original question is A: pizza shop because it", "answer": "C: london"}

{"text": "1 The question asks about the type of treatment a person should be given in applying to a job. 2.

The option 'equal opportunity', given the situation, is not possible until after the job applicant has been considered for job selection. 4. The option 'critical thinker' does not fit, as a critical thinker is an intellectual, someone who displays the ability to think, critically.

According to this context, John is a person who cares a lot about animals. \n2)  The question is then asking for a context/location (here referred to as 'place' for simplicity) where John might avoid going. \n3)  Hence the places where John might avoid going can be considered as a subset of the places that he would likely avoid going.\n4)  John cares a lot about his animals and avoid going to places where he suspects animal abuse might take place. \n5)  Places where one might suspect animal abuse can likely include parking lots, pet stores, or woodlands. \n6)  It is possible for John to go to a woodland and not suspect animal abuse. \n7)  Similarly possible is going a parking lot or pet store without suspecting animal abuse.  Hence the parking lot and the pet store could potentially be places that John goes to, but not necessarily. \n8)  Given all this information, the place that John can avoid going would be any place he suspects there might be animal abuse, which would include woodlands, parking lots, or pet stores.  (The possibility of going to a pet store not resulting in any suspicion of animal abuse is very unlikely, and most likely would be ruled out immediately.) \n9)  The most likely place John would avoid going to would be a woodland (as woodlands have the highest possibility of animal abuse with the least possibility for non-abuse), so woodland would be the correct answer choice.  \n\nSo, the final answer is Woodland.\n\nInput: Your shoes will get wet if there isn't an umbrella in the yard.

{"text": "1 The question is asking what would one tell Ali to do if he bumped into someone while walking. \n2. Since the question mentions 'he bumps into you', the other person can be seen as the one who is walking instead.\n3. Hence, we can eliminate D: sell products, as it refers to the idea of selling products while being on your feet, not while walking.\n4. E: speed up is also not applicable, as this could be seen as pushing someone.\n5. The first option in line, A: work hard, is not a good answer as work is not relevant to the given situation.\n6. The second option in line, B: slow down, is also not valid as it could be seen as pushing the other person as well.\n7. The third option in line, C: wear shoes, is not relevant to the situation as well.\n8. The last option, D: slow down, is definitely an option to consider, and stands as a plausiable answer until we assess the rest of the options.\n9. Now, the fourth option in line, E: slow up, seems like another good option and stands as a potential candidate as well.\n10. To reach a decision, we have to think about the different meanings of both A and B. If we take a moment to consider them, we see that A: work hard does not make sense in this context because it could be interpreted as pushing someone out of the way or trying to achieve something in a haphazard manner. \n11. On the other hand, B: slow down is a better option as it would mean taking a slower, more controlled approach to walking. The use of the word 'into you' implies that the person walking has enough room on the ground to move around, but is instead bumping into another person. \n12. There's no need for speeding up, since this would be dangerous and could cause an accident. 13. Using these reasoning, we can conclude that the correct answer is B.'slow down.\nSo the final answe ris B: slow down\n\nInput:If your listening music and someone come to the room,what will you do?

Cuddling is a possibility, if she is next to another person. This doesn't seem to fit since they aren't next to each other.\n5.

B. going to church. C. on their way home from work. D. going sightseeing. E. going to a wedding.\nOutput:  (Answer choices: E) 1. The context of the statement reveals that the person carrying the bundle is heading to a wedding. The fact that they are carrying clothing may be relevant to the fact they have a new outfit to wear. \n2. Church:  Going to church doesn't give a good reason for carrying a bundle of clothes. Perhaps it makes sense for going for brunch but not going for sightseeing.\n3. To be heading for brunch is not reasonable. Sightseeing could also be an option for this, but this should make the wedding venue a requirement.\n4. To be heading home from work is not probable, as the event being held is a wedding.\n5. To be going for a wedding fits well because the bundle of clothes can be worn by the person during the event.\n6. There are many other ways to be going for a weddings that can be considered.

The options are in the order that they'll get darker, night before afternoon, and night before day, which in most parts of the world can be narrowed down to B: day time and D: afternoon. \n\n4. \"She thought that she had been had been home at night\" is the same as saying that she thought that she had been at home during night(darker in the day) and early morning(darker in the night). \n\n5. Night time seems to be the most likely answer, so we can eliminate the time in which she was awake. \n\n6. The answer must be the early part of the afternoon because it indicates that when we say the only time she can leave is at night, it must be 9 PM instead of Midnight. \n\n7.

{"text": "1) The question is asking about an expectation associated with one being \"competent\" in their school work. Let's focus on what word's prefixes to \"competent\". By definition, \"competent\" means having an appropriate level of knowledge or expertise to do something rightly or effectively. Now combine this definition with \"school work\", we see that this expectation is most likely talking about expectations associated with school assignments or tests.\n2) If we now analyze the options offered, we can discard choices A, D and E as they simply do not fit in nor can they reasonably be considered \"expected results\" of competency. This leaves us with choices B, C and F.\n3) Let's examine what choices B and C signify. Choice B \"passing grade\" is typically the expected results of \"competency\" as in it's the standard \"successful\" outcome.\n4) Similar to choice B, choice C also signifies an expected result of \"competency\", in this case, the academic \"challenge\", or \"opportunity\" to learn.\n5) Lastly, choice F \"avoid pain\" is not an academic outcome of competency. This is an emotion or psychological response to failure to demonstrate the expected result of the work.\n6) After considering all of these elements, one can conclude that the correct answer here is choice B: passing grade, as it's the expected result which best fits the structure of this question.\nSo the final and correct answer is B:Passing grade\n\nInput: Which of the following would you eat at a dinner party?

{"text": "The question asks about a situation where there were not enough chairs for everyone, leading to a possible delay. \n\n1. The first option, 'Bookstore', deals with buying and selling books, so it's not relevant to the question as it doesn't mention a delay.\n\n2. The second option, 'Building', can potentially involve delays, but this depends on the specific building. For example, a bank building might have a waiting room where customers can wait, but this would be due to waiting to be seen by an employee rather than related to waiting for a chair. Hence, this particular option is not relevant to the context.\n\n3. The third option, 'Meeting', could potentially cover meetings where people are waiting for a meeting, but these generally involve an agenda and discussion, and are not as closely related to waiting for a specific chair.\n\n4. The fourth option, 'Office', could potentially involve waiting around an office, but this would depend on the office and the nature of the waiting.\n\n5. The fifth option, 'Coffeehouse', is a place where people might go to wait for a friend or relative, but this is not necessarily about waiting for a specific chair, and the situation does not explicitly have to do with them being late for a meeting.\n\n6. Thus, we can conclude that out of all the options available, it is most likely that the final choice would be the sixth one \u2013 'Coffeehouse'. The coffeehouse is a public space where people can wait for their friends or relatives and is thus the most closely related to scenarios in which people might be waiting for a specific chair due to a lack of available seats.\nSo the final option is E: coffeehouse\n\n    Instructions: answer the following multiple choice question, then select the best answer.\n1. What is the most likely place where one can't wait? Choices: A: bus station B: doctor's office C: post office D: waiting room E: coffee shop\nA. The question asks for a place where one can's wait. Since waiting usually implies that something is being done, the place where something else is being done cannot be used as a waiting place.

{"text": "The question asks about the kind of word you can use to combine two words. The word 'preposition' refers to the place where the words are related to each other in a sentence.\n1. The type of word that combines two words is the \u2018conjunction\u2019.\n2. The conjunctions include words such as 'and', 'but', and 'before'. Other conjunctions may have different names(such as correlative conjunctions).\n3. Adjectives modify or describe a noun, so they can't 'combine' two words.\n4. Interjections are words of excitement such as 'yeah', 'oops', or 'wow', that can't serve as a conjunction between words.\n5. Articles(such as 'a' or 'the') describe nouns, so they can be used only once to describe a noun, unlike conjunctions that usually connect 2 words in a sentence.\n6. Hence, the only word that combines words and is called a 'conjunction', is conjunction.\nSo the final answers is C: conjunction\n\nInput: What time would you use to eat a meal for a formal occasion?

This would imply that you can only find a school in a specific community and not in the city as a whole.\n7) Therefore, C: every city is the most suitable answer.

You could even disregard 'dissipate' and leave 'flown' and say the 'flown' because the money has been left with whoever the customer was and this option is the only one which mentions flown. \n4) The option E is incorrect because there is no such word. 5) What happens to money after a person uses it? \nIt becomes disbursed or spent or used up. \n6) The answer is D: fall out. Because this choice can be interpreted in a wide variety of possible ways. The question says'money after he or she has USED THE LAST OF IT.' Therefore it can be interpreted in many ways, but the word 'used' is a verb that is in present continuous tense. So this suggests that the money is still 'used'. So he or she USED the last of it, still now their money is used. So if it is no longer 'used' in the sense of being physically present or in possession what is it used for, it is 'used' for other purposes. 'Used' is an action word, the action has not ended. If the money has been physically taken away from the person he still has it 'used' in his head or in his memory to recollect the use. It is still being used, not physically spent, because it is not spent but used. So the question means 'after he or she has used(past tense) the last of it.' \nThe flowing out of money does not suggest the money has gone out, but in which direction would that direction be? Towards which way would the money flow? Towards his head to be still 'used' by him. Towards his memory where he can recollect his previous experiences, the money is still being used. We are not talking about disintegration like other forms of disintegration or disintegration in other words. The money has not disintegrated, it is only 'used' like an old song, used like a book or book, these types of expressions.

While eating and shopping can definitely take place in such a location, it cannot be said to have a variety of items which is required by the question. 6 Hence, we can eliminate B. 7 Similarly, the third option, C, is the owner's own house.

A 'cinema' is more likely to hold a single screening, so not an option. A 'party' would take the form of a social gathering, such as a birthday, anniversary, etc. but would be more intimate than this gathering described. The term 'opera' would suggest a formal, ritzy event with lots of people, but is too formal for this context. Performers at a stage would likely be entertainers at a festival, and that wouldn't necessarily coincide with this kind of gathering which seems to be a relaxed one.

Choices: 1: They were too loose 2: They were stiff and heavy 3: They were too tight 4: They were unattractive\nOutput: In the sentence, there is a hint in the question itself which tells us what was wrong with the woman\u2019s new seams. It says the seams were wrong. This basically narrows down the choices and leaves only one logical answer choice. \n\n\n1.\"These seams were too stiff, and heavy, so we can eliminate the option (2). \n2.\"These seams could also be too tight, or unattractive, but if that was the case, they would most likely be too tight or unattractive. And hence, we can eliminate (3) and (4). \n3.The only option left is (1). We don't have a clue of what is wrong, but the sentence mentions the woman's new jacket, so we can assume that there must be something wrong with the jacket. \n4.Now, that the wrong-ness of the seams is a given, the remaining option is: they were too loose. This makes sense, as if the seams are excessively loose, they won\u2019t be able to hold the garment together. And this choice is correct as well. \nSo the final answer, and thus the correct", "answer": "B: magazines"}
{"text": "This is the multiple choice question as I mentioned earlier...\n\nInput:When one has multiple pots for heating cooking fuel, it means that they also have a ______. Choices:  A. microwave oven B. fireplace C. gas stove D. toaster E. blender\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to consider what's missing given that they have a multiple pots.\n2) We know that a pot, by definition, is intended for heating food on a cooking stove.\n3) A microwave in itself can't do much for heating and cooking, so we can eliminate choices A and B.\n4) Choice C, a gas stove, has to be a possibility but it's not entirely obvious due its ambiguity. While stoves can use gas, other cooking appliances with a gas stove use it only to ignite the fuel. We need to further define the question to eliminate other ambiguity.\n5) It isn't clear where the fuel in these pots comes from, and not all homeowners have their own tanks.\n6) Choice D, a toaster because it could toast/heat bread, is unhelpful since the question does not require toast.\n7) Because of these points, the answer is left as E, a blender, since it can blend/heat food.\n8) After considering all the options, we have identified choice E as more likely. Thus, the answer is E, a blender because it can heat food as required.\nSo the final is correct answer is E, a Blender\n\nInput: When one visits a car dealership, they want an opportunity for __________.

The first three options, A: work in life, B: speak to people, and C: everywhere do not involve a way of earning or making money.\n4. The last two options, D: sitting ideal and E: care for people, are valid ways of earning money, but would not seem to involve God.\n5. Thus, the correct response is to be found somewhere between the second and third options. The second option includes \"do work in life,\" which can be a way to earn money.\n6.

{"text": "1.\"What is the result of an action\" is a question asking about the consequences of an action (e.g. performing a certain task, initiating a conflict, etc.) \n2. \"Civil\" refers to the public sphere so the options with a public connotation must be considered such as  public action (option C) and public interaction (option E).\n3. Hence, from the remaining options and considering that one might hurt their feelings when they are going to court, we can eliminate the first two options. \n4. The third and fourth options refer to feelings and therefore it's possible for one to hurt their feelings when acting (option C) or acting on their feelings (option D). However, while one might feel hurt physically or emotionally after going to court, we cannot assume the same for eating sandwiches. \n5. This leaves us with 5 possible answers. However, a few might be redundant in the remaining context. These redundant answers can be eliminated by checking for synonyms which will narrow down the possible answers to only two: \n6. Thus,  \"confusion\" and \"hurt feelings\" would be possible answers. \n7. To get the correct answer, we need to assess the synonyms: confusion and hurt. \"Confusion\" can be replaced by \"disarray\". While both \"disarray\" and \"hurt\" are used to hurt feelings, \"disarray\" refers not only to hurt feelings but also to damage, destruction, or any act of negligence. Hence, option D would be incorrect. \n8. Similarly, while \"hurt\" can be used to hurt feelings, it can also be used to hurt or harm someone's body. Hence, option E would be incorrect. 9. Therefore, the remaining answer which doesn't cause physical or emotional harm to any person nor causes any act of negligent destruction etc., would be \n10.

{"text": "1. The question requires us to identify a place where a desk normally occupied would be found. 2. The only places relevant to the question that may allow a desk to be occupied are an office building, a library and a schoolroom. 3. The term 'young' suggests that the person using the desk is a student who attends school, so we can eliminate 'D: bedroom' as not appropriate for the question's context. 4. Therefore, options 'A: office building' and 'C: library' are the only viable choices left, but the question asks where a desk normally used.5. It's not uncommon to find office buildings equipped with desks, but office buildings in general are rarely empty and not solely inhabited by a young person.

In a library, most desks are occupied by librarians, not students who would use the library to do their assignments, so it would not be appropriate for the context. 1+3+6=10=False.

Choices: A: office B: classroom C: hallway D: kitchen E: bedroom\nOutput\uff1a1. We can start answering the question by removing obviously incorrect options: B: classroom, D: kitchen E: hallway. 2. It's clear that in a classroom the long room isn't likely to be divided into two and neither are an office or a bedroom (unless the room is long enough to appear to be divided, even though it isn't). 3. Therefore, we can eliminate these four options. 4. The most obvious potential answer is C: hallway as even the name indicates that the word 'hall' suggests a large, long room divided into two segments. 5. However, C: hallway requires us to know that a hallway is long enough to be considered a room (whereas a doorway or other smaller space wouldn't necessarily be considered a room to begin with). 6.

Aside from singing and dancing, create art is the only job activity that's categorically creative and would be considered a full-time job. Therefore, create art stands as the most likely choice. Seeming similar, express yourself and write are not full-time activities as the phrasing would suggest and therefore, would be relatively less likely to be employed as one's full time job.\n3. Writing would be included as a full-time job activity but only if the person expressing 'themselves' was solely a writer. This is unlikely, however, as writing likely involves varying other skills and would need to be combined with another job to be considered a full-timer.\n4. The only choice that is almost an exception to the rule is sew. As a medium for creativity, sewing is very similar to the art form of create art. However, sewing is not considered as a profession, let alone a full-time job profession due to its noncreative connotations. Therefore, the closest reasonable choice is create art.\nSo the final answers are A: sew and C: express yourself\n\nInput:The last person standing in an office is likely to be  what? Choices: 1.

Since the doctor cannot be present, and there is no one to administer medical treatment to the injured person, the question does not allow for that option.\n\n5)The choice 'E: cross street' is incorrect because this is a scenario describing someone who is in the outdoors, injured, and far from human contact. 'crossing a street' is an action that would only be possible in a city where the injured person would be able to seek human assistance, and therefore is not a plausible solution. As such, the injured person will be forced to visit relatives because there is no other choice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is E: visit relatives", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}
{"text": "1) We can eliminate options A, B and E which are not possible at the site of the resturant (Space Needle). 2) We can also eliminate D because people typically do not eat clothing in these types of establishments.\n3) Now if we consider options C, D and E there are two options that sound like plausible answers, these are C and E. \n4) Option C has an Indian resturant  as the answer, this is the place where John would go to get the food. \n5) Option E also sounds like a plausible anwser because it implies that Indian people may eat here. \n6) However, when we consider the context of the question we could instead conclude that the location in the question, the Space Needle, is not a reservation.\n7) This means that the correct answer is probably option C since we have eliminated all other plausible answers and the answer in the question mentions the food rather than the Indian person. \nSo the final answer option is C: Curry\n\nInput:  where do you go if your looking for your old toy if it is not in the toy bin it is in an  area with drawers?\n Choices:  A. store B. shelf C. attic D. cabinet\n Output:\n1. In the answer there is an emphasis on finding an 'old toy'. The phrase 'old toy' implies that there is another type of toy, hence, not A: Store.\n2. In the answer, it is implied that if the toy is missing from the 'toy bin', then it is in 'an area with drawers'. \n3. This implies drawers are in the area and are not A: Store. This eliminates the store. \n4. Option B: Shelf implies drawers, and we can eliminate this option as well.\n5. Option C: Attic implies that there are drawers in an area, hence not option C either.\n6. We can conclude that the correct answer is D: cabinet as it implies that there are draws in an object. \nSo the answer is D: CABINET", "answer": "C: curry"}

Therefore, \"torso'' is an incorrect option. \nD: \"road\" is an inanimate part of the environment, and can be used in order to 'fall on'' in order to avoid injury, which is what the question states. \nE: \"body\" is an inanimate element of the human body, however it could potentially be used to avoid injury. This means 'fall on'' but does not indicate a choice of 'fall on'' that would not take the hit; for this reason, \"body\" is incorrect.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: body.\nSo the final answers are : A. leg, B.

{"text": "1.) The question asks about a pair of items- a hairbrush and bandages- which will be bought together. \n2.) The term 'bandage' refers to a kind of medicine and hence the question is asking about a place where bandages are sold/ bought. \n3.) The word 'buy' is used which implies purchase (as opposed to rent). \n4.) The word 'a' indicates an item or two that may be bought in a single location so 'you can buy a hairbrush [and] bandages along with.......'. \n5.) Hence combining all the above information, a place where one can buy a hairbrich and bandages is a drugstore. \n6.) Hospital is a place where sick people are taken for treatment while bedroom is a place where one sleeps (which is unrelated to bandages). \n7.) Car is a moving vehicle and house is a dwelling or a residence in general. Hence neither of these options makes any sense in this context. \n8.) Finally, Drugstore is the only applicable answer. \n9.) Since our intention was to identify a place where bandages may be bought, the correct answer therefore, is drugstore.\nSo the final answers is D: drugstore", "answer": "A: drugstore"}
{"text": "1 The question is asking about the place where a restaurant would put a candle that has been lit. \n2. There are three options that could possibly be true and work according to the question. These options are A: dimly lit rooms, B: kitchen, and D: table.\n3. The first option, C: Wall is not a place where a restaurant would normally have a candle and it could only serve as a possible location if there were a mural of a wall that had a candle burning or was covered in a candle-themed d\u00e9cor.\n4. The second option, A: dimly lit restaurant room, is not an appropriate place to have a candle burning since dimly lit rooms are not conducive to having candles because the candle will most likely burn down more rapidly in a dark surrounding.\n5. A kitchen, on the other hand, is a perfect location for burning a candle. Kitchens typically have a stove and other cooking appliances that emit heat, smoke, and odors, which can make it difficult for a candle to burn for a prolonged amount of time. However, this option is not correct since it can be both a place and a thing that's an appliance. We only need to concern ourselves with the places option.\n6. The final option is D: table. Since a table is a place, it could be where the restaurant would put the candle, provided that it is on the table and the lighting conditions are good.\nThus, by combining all the information, we can conclude that the correct answer is D: table. A table is the only option that meets all the mentioned criteria, making it the top answer that is the restaurant would most likely put the candle in.\nSo the final answers is D: table\n\nInput: Where is it if someone is looking for a job?

{"text": "1. The question is looking for a source of milk as opposed to a type of animal that produces milk.\n2. The options A: supermarket and B: pig don't seem to fit the criteria since they aren't animals that produce milk. \n3. The option C: cow is a type of animal that can produce milk(like the question), but it's not necessarily a source of milk since there could be other cows or animals producing milk.\n4. Hence, the choice D: refrigerators is the closest as it represents a place where milk could be stored in bulk quantities. 5. Another option is E: store where one could find the same refrigerators containing milk.\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is E: store.\nSo the final answers are E: store\n\n\nInput: What color is green? Choices:  a: yellow b:brown C:green.D:white E: blue\nOutput: \nFirst let us know that the question here is about color.\n1. The option A : yellow is not the right one, since it's neither color\n2. Option B : brown is a type of color, which means it should be a candidate for the correct answer.\n3. The option c : green is also a type of color, but not an answer\n4. The option D:white is also a type of colour and is neither a fit for the question.\n5. The option E: blue is also a type of a color which is not relevant as well.\n6. After considering all the options and evaluating their suitability, it is clear that the right answer for the question is B:brown\n\nSo the right answer to the question is B: brown", "answer": "C: cow"}
{"text": "1.) Society cannot exist without numbers. \n2.) The word 'rise' could mean 'increase in number' \n3.) The first option, A, stands out as a possibility because population often increases in a specific space such as a country or city. \n4.) A population is a collective group of people, and one could assume the group of people is defined by the location of the population. \n5.) Hence, if numbers are essential to society, and they rise only in specific spaces, the specific space should be a populated area. \n6.) The other spaces mentioned, government and group of people, are not relevant as they do not increase in number. \n7.) To conclude, the correct answer is population to rise. \nSo the final answer are A:population\n\nInput: To get to the top of the mountain you need to be strong and have a positive sense of self.  Which type of climbing requires skill and technique? Choices: 1. A: Bouldering 2. B: Climbing 3. C: Mountaineering 4. D: Scramble 5. E: Cable-guided\nOutput: 1) To get to the top, you need to be strong 2) The word 'Skill and technique' 3) To succeed on a climb, you need to be physically strong, have good hand-eye coordination, and know some basic climbing movements and tactics. 4) The climbing terms climbing and mountaineering refer to the kind of climbing used in competitions and on mountains. 5) This isn't what the question is asking.\n6) Scrambling requires using both hands and feet and is similar to scaling a mountain.\n7) It requires skill and technique.\n8) Climbing is a type of scrambling, hence also requires skill and technique. \n9) The question has already eliminated mountaineering.\n10) Now, we need to compare only scrambling and climbing.\n11) 'Climbing' is more specific than'scrambling' and could answer the question.\n12) Therefore, the correct answer is A: Climbing\nSo the final answer A: Climbing", "answer": "B: populated area"}

{"text": "1.) The question is asking about a place where one could find a help, and it also hints towards it being a place where transport is usually available. It could be a railway station or an airport, but an ordinary home or office isn't included in the options. 2.) Option D: street is irrelevant since one doesn't necessarily need to get there on a bus, and street and city are basically the same thing. 3.) B: lottery ticket indicates that it's about a station where people purchase lottery tickets. However, this is irrelevant as this question is specifically about help, not about purchasing things in general or specifically about buying lottery tickets. 4.) A: city centre is vague and could be interpreted as a lot of different locations, from streets to government or private buildings. Hence, it's best to eliminate it from consideration. 5.) Option C:maps could refer to a map to help one reach a destination on a bus, or it could simply be a map of the actual area the bus station is located in. If it's the latter, this is a better selection because the idea is not to find transport and a map can help one find the station and navigate it to reach its destination. However, as the question doesn't provide any clues it's necessary to eliminate D: street E: a busy city since these aren't the precise options the question is looking for. 6.) After the previous information, the logical conclusion that remains is C: maps is the best answer out of the choices. \nSo the final answer in this question is C: maps\n\nInput:In the USA, who owns the majority of the railroads? Answer Choices:A) private railway firms B) private people C) private industries D) corporations E) government 7.) The question asks about railroads but doesn't directly mention the USA. Thus we can deduce that the question is geographically general in scope and not specific to the USA. According to an article by the World Bank, the private sector was in control of 63.9% of the rail industry in 1999 and 63.6% in 2004. If anything the percentage of private ownership is decreasing. 8.)

{"text": "1: The question asks how a person might help someone who is not able to speak \"coherently\".\n2: The word \"coherent\" connotes someone who is articulate and speaks well so the correct response must be related to speaking coherently.\n3: \"Sign Language\" may seem like the correct answer initially, but is actually incoherent since it involves signs (not words) and the ability to comprehend and speak words.\n4: \"Complete sentence\" could also be an initially plausible response. However, a complete sentence would imply that it is a complete thought and is articulate so it wouldn't be helpful to someone who is \"not able to speak coherent\", implying incoherent.\n5: \"Drink tea\" is not possible as it does not have any relation to coherent speaking and drinking tea is just an activity anyone can engage themselves in. Therefore, it may not be helpful either.\n6: \"Feel angry\" is not possible either. Anger refers to a feeling, not a state. Anger only occurs for a period of time and could be harmful to someone who is not able articulate clearly with words - the objective of this question.\n7: \"Crossstreet\" is not a thing at all. \n8: \"Complete sentence\" is not a valid answer either.\n9: As per the above answers, we see that the correct option is \"Drink tea\" as it may not be a direct \"help\" to anyone who is not able to articulate well but since this is a social activity and one can just talk normally, it would be less of a burden, compared to other options.\nSo the final solution is D: drink tea\n\nInput: On a very hot day, why would a person have to make sure they are hydrated?

{"text": "1.) The question asks about what may/may not happen to people who are models. \n2.) People who are models are usually referred to as models. \n3.) The fourth line of the clue hints that this scenario involves 'appearance', and so option E, which mentions appearances, has become the only relevant option from the beginning.\n4.) Option A is irrelevant since no description is given about the appearances of people who are models.\n5.) Both B and C are irrelevant since they don't mention anything about how the people behave or 'appear'.\n6.) Option D is irrelevant as it does not mention anything about the appearance or behavior of people who are models, and \n7.)

A: building B: hospital C: farm D: boat E: train\nOutput: 1) The question asks the reader about where doctors live; hence, A building and B hospital are irrelevant; these are places where doctors work.\n2) Option C, farm, is also irrelevant; doctors do not usually live on farms, nor have anything to do with farming.\n3) Option D, E boat, is also irrelevant; boats are not where people usually live.\n4) Option A, B: hospital, is also irrelevant; hospitals are where doctors work but never where doctors live, as doctors cannot just stay in a hospital for their entire lives.\n5) So the only remaining option is A: building, as doctors would typically work in hospitals, and then stay in buildings where are they can be in more familiar surroundings with their families and friends.\nSo the final correct answer is A: building\n\n\n### Instruction:Write the logic, or explain your answer, in clear English.

Fire is the oldest heat (or fuel) source on Earth, so the answer is B: fire.\n2) Even though the Dan is outfitting his house with fire, he is not going to use a fireplace. This indicates that the fuel used to make fire will be something like wood or coal, which are the oldest materials known to be on Earth.\n3) The solar and sun are also options, but Dan is using fire, so we can eliminate these options from the answer. We are not talking about solar or sun energy, and the word \"outfitted\" indicates that Dan is also not using solar panels to cover his house.\n4) We are not talking about any type of energy or source, but a specific heat source. The fuel used is coal or wood by the Dan is outfitted so we know that he is cooking the fuel (otherwise, he would be using solar energy or sun energy, not coal or wood). Hence, the correct answer is E: coal or wood.\nSo the finals answer is E: coal and wood\n\nInput:Where are you when on vacation you enjoy the natural beauty of the land? Choices: B A: beach C: mountains E: woods D: riverside\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking where one enjoys the natural beauty of the area while on vacation. \n2.) While beach and riverside could both be described as vacation spots, this question doesn't give any indication that we're not talking about a specific vacation that one takes to a beach/seaside.\n3.) Combining the above information with the options available, the correct answer would have to be C: mountains since one can enjoy the natural beauty of an area by visiting the mountain sites, but not the other way around.\nSo the correct answer is C: mountains\n\nInput:What is the smallest room in a house?

The question asks where one would go if one wanted access to an art museum.\n2. The answer is not A the book depository since that's a location to deposit old books. \n3. The answer is not B the church since a church does not offer free access to an artwork. \n4. The answer is not C the library since a library does not offer free access, but rather loans books for a fee to read.\n5.  The answer is not D the bank since banks don't generally offer free access to artwork.\n6. The answer finally found is E the gallery, since 'gallery' is defined as 1a a place where art and pictures are displayed for the public, so we can conclude that if one wants to have free access to artwork, one should go to a gallery. \nSo the final answer gallery\n\nInput: It is not unheard of to see young children go to the where?

{"text": "1/4\nThe fourth answer choice is incorrect.  As the question states, James was delayed for a couple hours because he had a \"connection,\" meaning that he had to make a stop, and his flight was changed or delayed.  This means that James did not \"arrive in Las Vegas\" when he was delayed, because he was making a connection between flights. To find the correct answer, we must determine where James had to make his connection. While he may have made a connection to his final destination, he would not have arrived at \"Las Vegas\" if he had.  Therefore, our options are A, B, or C.\n2/4\nEven though \"Wall\" may seem like it could connect to many of our options, it is not appropriate. The answer choices are either for an \"airport\" or \"company\" for the connection.  They do not have to do with walls at all. \n3/4\nEven if you know \"Love\" isn't the correct answer, you can still get it right if you know why it's not the correct answer.  We can rule out \"love\" because it would not be something someone would be delayed for, so the connection has nothing to do with love.  By knowing this, we also know that it cannot connect to any other answer choice. \n4/4\nWhen it comes to reading these problems, it is important to work logically.  For example, \"James was delayed for a few hours because he had to make a connection.  Where is the most likely place for his connection?\"\nInstead of reading this question and thinking \"love\", you can ask \"Why was he delayed?\"  This way, we can narrow our options to locations where he is likely to make a connection and then eliminate the rest.\nSo the final answers are\nA:company\nC:airport\n\nInput:In what situation would a shopper place a phone call on his or her cell phone during business hours?

Permanence (i.e., permanence) is the opposite of ephemerality, according to the dictionary.\n3:The second option, B: ephemera, is a synonym for the keyword given, and is therefore incorrect. Ephemeral is the keyword desired by the question, as can be inferred from the word 'ephemeral' in the question.\n4:The third option, C: long-living, is not a negative variant of the keyword given, and does not apply as an answer.\n5:The last option, D: fleeting, is an appropriate negative option and can be chosen as an appropriate answer.\n6:Accordingly, the correct answer is D: fleeting as it is a proper negative option for the keyword given.\nSo the final word for describing that will last only a shrt time would be 'fleeting'.\n\n## Problem 1.2.1\n\nInput:'He is very busy today.'

Choices: \tA: in the field B: around lunch break C: outside the factory D: in the bathroom E: on the side of the road\nOutput: 1:The question is asking about a location where an employee would typically eat lunch between work breaks, in accordance with the term 'on a worker's luch break'.\n2:The term 'factory' refers to a space where workers are employed to do specific tasks, hence working at a factory involves being in this space.\n3:The options C: outside the factory, D: in the bathrooom, & E: on the side on the road, are all incorrect because these locations are not typically associated with the place where an employee eats lunch.\n4:Hence, the correct answer is A: in the field. This location, often a farming area close to the actual factory, is where workers would typically eat lunch during their work breaks due to the convenience and proximity to the factory.\nSo the final  answer is A: in field:", "answer": "E: school"}
{"text": "1. The question asks where one might be able to view sharks in a tunnel. \n2. To simplify, the question can be re-worded as \"Where can I see a tunnel of sharks?\" \n3. The first three options all make little sense since they don't involve viewing sharks in a tunnel, so these can be eliminated. \n4. The last two options, D: indian ocean and E: gulf of medee, involve viewing tunnels of sharks, and thus stand to be valid answer choices. \n5. However, D: indian Ocean is not relevant since it's a vast ocean body and not where one would necessarily go to observe sharks in a tunnel as hinted in the question. \n6. In addition, E: gulf of Mexico is not an ocean body; instead it's a wide open body of water and not where one would typically see tunnel of sharks. \nHence, the best answer is still C: pacific ocean, since it's the type of place where one would expect to find tunnel of sharks.\nSo the final answers is C: pacific ocean", "answer": "B: sea world"}
{"text": "1. The question is asked to a witness who has seen a murder and is asked why the murderer confessed.\n2. The answer can't be based on a question (or lack thereof) as 'confess' can be answered positively or negatively.\n3. The murderer's motivation is less important than the person they confess the crime to. \n4. Hence, the murderer will most likely confess to'save himself' to a'someone other than a psychologist' (or in simpler words, to someone outside the court).\n5. From the given options, we notice that 'to a psychologist' is the only one that can't be ruled out to be correct. Hence, answer D lies with: to a psychologist.\nSo the final ans. is D: to a psychologist\n\nInput: Where do you need to go if you want to buy a boat? Choices: A: ocean B: ship C: yacht D: ocean harbor E: ship shop\nOutput: \nWhen buying a boat,'ship' stores are relevant as they can sell or rent out boats. \nShips are either at harbors(sea ports) or at ship stores. Hence if you ask someone who sells boats the question to buy a boat, they will suggest you 'go to a ship store'. \nSince both A: or C: are irrelevant, the only remaining options are B: and D:.\nHowever, D(ship harbor) cannot be ruled out, but neither can B(ocean). If an ocean store is possible, then so can harbors.\n4. Hence, based on the remaining options, B(ocean) is the only one that is relevant, so 'B' stands as the correct answer.\nSo the final answr is B: ocean\n\nInput: What would you do with an empty bag?

{"text": "1.\"The crowd wasn't big\" refers to \"it\" in \"crowd\", so \"it\" is singular.\n2. Even though it's one large crowd, the word \"crowd\" when used without preposition is just a crowd.\n3. A field is a large open area without boundaries and is often used to refer to vast spaces occupied by a large number of entities without a specific organization, hence a large group of things is a field. Hence, the best fit is option C: small group.\n4. As much as the singular \"crowd\" can refer to a group or small group, the singular \"is\" is always taken to mean 'is' referring to number. So, the singular \"crowds\" can only be \"alone\" (option B: alone)\n5. None of the other options can refer to the singular \"crowdon't\", thus the correct answer is option B: alone.\n\nInput:  What is unique about people who visit the park after work? Choices: 1. The park visitors work in the mornings.\n2. All park visitors are married.\n3. People who visit the park in the mornings are the only visitors.\n4. People who visit the mornings are only single. \nOutput: 1) Option 1 is the only one referring to people who visit the park in/after work. \n2) Option 2 is inappropriate because it refers to all park visitors.\n3) Option 3 also doesn't fit since people who visit the park at mornings could include both married and single people.\n4) The last option is in fact the best fit since it refers to people who visit the mornnings and are single, thus the correct answer is 3: people who visit the park are only single.", "answer": "C: small group"}
{"text": "1:The first statement is 'When clothes get mouldy or mildewy, they probably can't be rinsed.' Therefore, we can eliminate all of the options except for A: hang in closets.\n2. The statement is saying that we are to hang clothes, not clothing items. Clothing items include items like shoes. We need to look at a single item of clothing, like a T-shirt, in this case, so we can eliminate both clothing store and sewing room. Furthermore, 'become soiled' does not make sense as soiled clothing, unless it's extremely mouldy or milky, needs to be hand-washed.\n3. Therefore, the answer is A: hang in closett or B: air out.\nSo the final answers are A: hang in clossett and B: air out.", "answer": "E: air out"}

Walking on a road is a correct path while driving on a road is incorrect and can be considered as a bad response. 2 B: move to a local town is the correct response as it indicates moving elsewhere rather than on the road. 3 C: return to the previous street is incorrect, because returning to a previous street means walking on the current road and you were trying to find a way to a destination. 4 D: call for directions is correct, as it indicates the use of maps, which is the opposite of what the riddle is asking. \n\nInput: What will you do if the road does not go on the right way?

Moreover, his decision to stop competing may stem from him losing frequently.\n\n4: The fourth option, 'dying', is unrelated and thus can be eliminated. \n\n5: Similarly, the final option, 'quitting', is relevant and suggests that James may have felt as though he had no other choice.\n\n6: Considering the remaining options, quitting best describes James' situation and reason for stopping competing. It indicates that he may have felt as though the competition was no longer fun and he couldn't handle its demanding nature anymore.

Choices: A: at a store B: in her studio C: at carpentry shop D: in her living room E: on her patio\nOutput:1) In this question, we're told that an Artist cuts wood and also displays her artwork and is able to do so because she made boxes. We're also told that she cuts the wood in her studio (i.e. \"in her\" studio) and also at a store (i.e. outside of her studio). Hence, she cuts the wood outside of her studio at a store.2) A more specific answer is \"in a store\" (option A) or \"in a carpenter's shop\" (option C).3) However, we can now rule out option D as it pertains to where she displays her art, and thus her display is done in her studio (option C). Additionally, we can rule out option E as well since her studio is not used to make the boxes (only cut the wood) which means it is not the place in which she displays her artwork. So, from the two most specific questions, we can thus conclude that it is answered with option C: at a carpenter' shop.\n\nInput:In a grocery store, what is near the toothpaste? Choices: A.

Based on those definitions good Karma should be the correct answer. \n4) Since we know that the correct answer is good Karma, I'm now considering what the rest of the options mean. Good Karma is associated with the positive feelings of happiness and fulfillion, and so we must eliminate answers which aren't associated with the same feelings. \n5) The first answer, A: nice feeling is not associated with the same feelings and so is therefore not the correct answer. 6) The second answer, B: good Karma is associated with happiness and fulfilment and so is the correct answer, however the only answer we are considering is good karma which means choice B: good Karma should be selected. \nSo the final answer B: good Karma\n\nInput: How far can a 7-inch piece of cotton cloth cover? Choices: 1. B 5 inches 2. C 16 inches 3. D 25 inches 4. E 31 inches 5. F 20 inches\nOutput: 1.) There's no point in considering 1, 5, or 6 since they all cover less than 7 inches. 2.) Even though 2 covers more than 7 inches, it only covers 16, so we can eliminate that option. \n3.) The same logic that eliminates answer 2 can be applied to answer 3, however answer 3 covers more than the question asks.\n4.) The question specifically asks for an option that covers a 7-inch length, hence 4 should be considered a possibility. \n5.)

Option D, take notes, has two 'o's whereas the original has one. 6.) Option E, scribble, has two 'b's whereas the original does not. 7.)

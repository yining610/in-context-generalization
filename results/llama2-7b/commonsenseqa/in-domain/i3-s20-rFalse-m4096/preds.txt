So the answer is a part of a name and `gas station` sounds more suitable to me.<n><n><n>* the question asks the name of an entity, so we do not need the complete answers or names from the phrases, we just need to know only what is it called. therefore, we will know the answer after we see it used again. `Bedroom` sounds more suitable to use there.<n><n>* the question is about what is called in a certain place. Thus we only get the second part of the question, `wildlife refuge`. Here `story book` also sounds logical as it could be a part of that kind of book<n><n>* here we are given the word `toy store` as a whole, so the answer is more logical to be `Toy Store`<n><n>* now, we are asked the name of a place and we are given only its second form.  We do not need to know the complete phrase, because its only about the name.<n><n><n>### 4.<n>* I will be careful here too, since they only give us the second half of some of the phrases, so for instance in this case they give us `Countryside`, so the answer is the first part of this phrase and the second is `Great outdoors`. <n><n>### 5.<n>* The answer is the last word of the second phrase, So I will only give the answer as a whole ( the name of the place). <n><n>

This time we have a more complex problem on our hands; as 'c' = car which is not in the list passed into the function.<n><n>Now the code then checks for a letter 'd'. Again we have a simple problem. 'd='doctor is in the list. <n><n>Then, we come across a list which is not empty.  'e' = elephant.<n>The code then proceeds to see if there are any more in the list.<n><n>We come up against the next letter 'f'. It is not in the list and is not in the next string. Therefore it is not in the list that we pass into the function.

It takes a lot of effort and time to write clean and working code: be sure to also take the time to write clean and clear explanation of your code.<n><n>Comment: What have you tried so far? This site doesn't work the way it used to, so if you've tried something and haven't been able to get it to work, then post a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) example.

If the options are in the code, then we know it is a multiple choice question. However, if the options are stored as String objects, we may have problems due to strings containing embedded line breaks, as the example `Option 2: 4` shows to us. We can get around this by using a regular expression.<n><n>The basic instruction to check if the question is multiple choice is:<n><n>```<n>if (choice!= 0) {<n>    // do something<n>}<n>```<n><n>The code would then compare the input to the last variable we set `choice[0]` to. If `choice` was a String rather than something like a number array, we need to use the Regular Expression Pattern `\d+(?=\d+)` which matches any number followed by a space followed by another number. We should then make sure that the

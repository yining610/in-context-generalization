Choices:  **A: have more fun** B: have a better time **C: give it all away** D: throw a celebration E: buy something really cool\n\nAnswer: C: give it all away\n\n### **Instruction:**You made the right decision to use a smaller word for the answer to \"A\" in the first part and \"C\" in the second part, to prevent confusion. Here's how we made that happen, and why it makes a big difference to success:\n   1. The first part has \"a\" and the second part has \"b\", and they always end in the letter \"e\". That is, the word always ends with an \"e\". Make sure this \"e\" is small in size to prevent misreading. This example has shown it correctly with the boldface \"e\" so all questions should look like this.\n   1. The last letter of each word in the answer is always the same. The last letter of a is c and the last letter of b is e. The last letter is the right letter to highlight and make smaller in size. As such, you should always highlight and make smaller in-size the letter where \"a\" and \"b\" meet with the matching \"e\".\n   1. A good example is below where \"e\" becomes \"eh\", where the \"h\" is not important to the last letter of \"b\", but makes the word smaller and more clearly indicates it's the last letter.\n   1. We have made our sample look like in the \"above format\" with the \"e size 8\" and \"a-b-e size 12\", so readjusting your font in-size can help you make your own answers look like we do.\n\n### **Output:**\n\n   1.

{"text": "#### Correct answer\n\n* The Answer is (C): change yourself - if you look at your answer choices, one of them means to change the world or society. So changing your personal life, like your interests in things, could very well have a trickle down effect on society, but you aren't forcing them onto other people.\n\n#### Incorrect answer\n\n* The answer is not either (A) or (E) because those choices mean that you are not actually taking any action yourself to change something about society, whether it's violent in the case of a riot or non-violent in the case of social activism. You are simply advocating for certain actions to be taken by society without taking any yourself.  By advocating for change, you would also need to be someone who could be actively involved in bringing about change but the test states that you just have to start with your person life to make impact.\n* If you want to change society, you need to start from inside your person life, meaning doing things to be change yourself, or changing your mind-set (this seems to be what they meant more by the word change yourself).\n\n### Demands:\n* Use commas to split sentences.\n* Be sure to write the number after the letter (example: A: 1st answer, B: 2nd answer, etc.)\n* Ensure your answers match the correct question.", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

They are the people, who in this case never get out of bed", "answer": "D: wakefulness"}

{"text": "* Response One\nTo attend school for twelve years and do something meaningful is not a bad idea. This is according to [Harris](https://www.pexels.com/@jules-harris-343318) who is an authority in the field of career development, she said: Too many students enter the working world with very little direction in terms of life skills. One thing I see again and again is that people are stuck doing things that they'd never want to do, and for no reason other that they have no idea they have options.\n\n* Response Two\nI would prefer being a graduate since it means that you are through and you are ready to face the challenges of the real world, as [John](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/author/jonathan-hornibrook/) said, being a graduate means you have the experience and skills and knowledge to move smoothly into the workforce.\n\n* Response Three\nThe right thing for me to do is to become a graduate. As [Paul](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwixrJzE-IzlAhVO8qQKHV0HBGUQFjASegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thequint.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw1sE8v37RKZL7RwFo-KwvM) said, to graduate means to go through the 12 years of education and you have the credentials required to prove that you are ready to tackle any new challenge that comes your way in all spheres of the social, economic, political, and even the educational arenas. Graduating is no child's play, it's not all about the papers you carry home after sitting through those boring classes but rather about how ready you are to live your life. I\u2019m not ready to begin life yet.\n\n* Response Four\nIf I do the following to get ready to attend university, I will be able to graduate from high school.

We are not looking for a word, we are not looking at which one is next to the closest option. We are looking for the answer that is not in any of the options.\n\n### Question:\nAlice was at work for the first 8 hours of her day.  In those 8 hours she was on the clock for how many minutes?\nAnswer: 2\n\n### Inputs:\n```\nThe first two inputs are 5 and 8 and are the total minutes required for Alice to be working that day. Therefore, you always know the total minutes after which you can subtract in order to get the exact number of minutes. \n```\n\n### Response\n  If you answer correctly it will show how many minutes and seconds you had before leaving work. Otherwise show how much more time you will need.\n\n  This problem takes care of rounding issues. A person on the clock may work for 5 minutes and 43 seconds\n  in a year (if they are on the clock 2/3 of their working days a year)\n\n### Question 2:\n\nThe second question is much like the first. It begins with an input then asks a question for the answer with an 8-hour-day.\n\nIn the second question you are always looking for the smallest number that is in less than the other input.\n\nNotice a small change. I changed the question to, \"How much less hours will Alice have\" instead of seconds.\n### Instruction 2:\n\n### The instruction above would be the same.\n\n### Response 2:\n\nYou can tell because you don't know how long Alice worked so you can't answer, \"How much less\"\n\n### Question #3\n\nNotice the question is similar to question #2. However, this takes care of minutes and hours. All that is needed is what is the total minutes?\n\nIn this question, you must subtract the previous number of minutes to get the actual number of minutes available.

{"text": "He was scared of death\n\n### Input\nWhat was your most rewarding job?\n\n### Response\nMy most rewarding job was the job as a boss in a corporation.  Because I was boss, I could decide which job was best assigned to my employees and I could give instructions to them.  The thing I liked about being the boss the most was that I had all the authority.  My most difficult job was being a boss.  I felt a lot of pressure because I had to do everything perfectly. My job as a boss also had many responsibilities.  And I liked the responsibility.  But because of all the job responsibilities,  I also had to work hard.\n\n### Input What was your least rewarding job?\n### Response My least rewarding job was at the movie studio because even though I was a camera man, I didn't really get to do a lot.  I like taking photos and was so excited when the job was first offered to me, because I could take pictures and they would be great and that the people involved with the movie would be happy.  But when I first started I found there was too much paperwork and no one was happy with me until I got used to the job and started taking good pictures.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How was your job at the movie studio different from your job as a boss?\n\n### Answer:\n1. The main problem about my boss job is that the people working for me did not want to be bossed.    They were upset at my first efforts and there were complaints about me that I had to deal with.    They did not appreciate my efforts because they wanted to do things the way they had always done and not change.  They wanted me to get them jobs and to decide where they were going to work and what job they were going to do.  I found that it was difficult to be the boss and make all the decisions.  I had to make decisions that satisfied them.    I found this a difficult job.    I found that I had too many responsibilities and had to make decisions about the lives of the people working for me.  I had to consider the complaints, too.  I thought I did an excellent job.    Also, I did not like to do the paperwork and I was not good at it.", "answer": "A: death"}

See DeepL in your settings or read this [tutorial on using DeepL as an AWK tokenizer](./tutorial-DeepL.md).\n- The correct spacing: For example, you can capitalize the first letter of the sentences, do not space \"the\" (only if it is two words) and use a period after an exclamation mark. There is no need to use an exclamation mark after the question. A full stop is ok, or just space it like this: \"A period is space if you have a dot. An exclamation is space if you have an exclamation\", or you can delete the period in this sentence.\n- The correct spelling: Use a translation to do a first step spelling correction. You should also look at how to deal with tricky word/tokens like those with umlauts.\n\nZoe's Sample Response\n\n### Now review the solution sample with the given input (in the [instruction](#Instruction)).

Jake said he felt he could do it because he liked to live by a certain rule. Sara wanted to help but Jake didn't know anything was wrong so she asked one more time. He answered that he had a goal to save everything anyway, so if he was poorer, it wouldn't matter. Sara felt the conversation was getting long-winded and was worried about Jake as she didn't understand what to do next. Then Sara realized Jake's reply that he had nothing valuable to him so she could just give him ashe a gift. She was shocked to hear this, so she asked a question about what he wanted. Jake explained that he liked to be generous with what he has and that he didn't mind being poor if he was helping other. He suggested that she should ask a question to Jake that would take away some time, such as whether Jake had any spare coins or change or what if he had nothing valuable left. Jake assured her that he would never leave his family in distress and offered her an opportunity in return for the gift if he didn't have anything valuable left. She asked Jake what do you typically do if you are on a date. Jake answered that he loves going out with his partner and they sit together and talk about every little thing or share something interesting and try not to eat too much. Sara was surprised because the discussion was a great idea and she asked again about the next. Jake said he has no problem but she insisted he answer because if they were dating, she could help take care of any problems. Jake said he didn't want any help, though he could have some more. He liked to be independent and free but he would do anything anyone asked for. Jake also told that his mother tried to give him gifts for the birthday every week, but she couldn't stop herself. Sara asked if he took the advice. Jake said that he would if she didn't mind but she was very generous so he appreciated it. He said he was waiting for the gift before opening the door but didn't know what type of gift it was because no one had told him yet. He had never met", "answer": "A: sit"}

He decided to find the missing element by looking at the table element and analyzing the pattern. He found that element B was missing in the problem. The next day, he realized he messed up and there was element D missing. What other element could have been missed? Explain your solution\n\n### Inputs\nAlex worked on a problem. There is an element A missing in the problem. He then found 7/10 and 5/6 of the element. He then moved on to the next part, which states that C = 1/B + B/A. He realized part C was missing and there was only 6/5 of part A. He then realized that there is only 5/6 of element B since the original element is 1 B then you take every sixth of that number and add it up. After adding up all the numbers, Alex realized they add up to 4/5 of element A. He realized this because element A is 7/10, C/D is 11/13, B/A = 6/5. Explain the process.\n\n### Response\nI realized there is only 5 elements and that 5 elements is 1/2 of B. I added the number and realized D is missing.

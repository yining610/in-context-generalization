A word can look like an action or it can look like an object.  Either way, I create a set of words to check for these types of words.  I store the words in an array for later checking for the presence of these words.  This array is populated if the string contains an action word (a, an, am), the possessive's, a 'd' or 'ed' suffix.  To prevent errors, I also check for negative words, like 'won't' and 'didn't. \n\nThen I create another set of words that would be verbs, which include 'is', 'are', 'was', etc. and store them in their own array.\n\nFinally, I iterate and take the action words in the first array, do a word search on the current string using those action words.  If a word exists, I check to see if it's possessive or an action word.  The possessive words we simply treat as a normal word, so we keep searching to see if the possession is direct or indirect.  If it's indirect the's' will not be capitalized when searching the direct form.  The action words are added to the correct set if they are found and the search for an indirect action word is terminated. \n\nThis is also where the checking for the negative words occurs, after the indirect word is checked for validity.  If the indirect word is valid, then the current word must be the possession and we terminate the search.  If it'e not valid, then we search again after all the negative words are eliminated.\n\nThe second step is checking for the verb.  We iterate through the verb array and do a search for the words.  These verbs are already in lower case and if", "answer": "B: friend's house"}

Each keyword should be an edge in the graph. You can check if the parent is null, the value is not set in levelOrder(parent) and the value is not null, the edge(start, parent) has non null value in the graph and use that value to traverse right and left, the parent node is null in the graph or not set in levelOrder function or not null in the graph.\n\n#### Instruments:\n1.

Choices: \nA: illiterate B; knowledgable\nC: own house D; have enough food\nE: meet expectations\n\nOutput:C\n\n\n\n\nThe question asks you to write a script. In order to do this, you need some information about the script that Python understands. \nThis information is stored in a file called __init__.py__ which must exist at the root (top) of the folder for each module. \n\nLet's make a simple script file to demonstrate some of the information it contains and use relative paths to import modules. \n\nIn the root folder of our project, start a new file called __init__. \n\n```python\nimport random\nimport sys\nprint('Hello {}'.format(sys.argv[1]))\n```\n\nThe __init__.py file exists as a file only in projects that contain Python scripts. If there is no __init__.py file present at the root of a project, the OS will treat it as a directory instead. \n\nThe __init__ file should contain a blank line at the beginning to indicate it should not be interpreted as Python code.\n\nYou can see the difference by navigating to the folder containing the project. For Windows, you can use the Windows Explorer File Manager or Command Line. Mac has a Finder and a Terminal. For Linux, navigating with the Command Line is common. \n\nWhen viewing the folder through the Command Line, type cd then the folder name. When navigating through the Explorer, Right Click the folder and go to Properties to view the Shortcut.\n\nIf there is a __init__.py file, it's usually easy to tell by the icon in the folder. \n\nIn both cases, the icon to the right of the file name indicates it's a file.\n\nMac, Linux and Windows all show a file icon.\n\nWindows also shows a folder or blank icon depending on if the folder contains other files.\n\nThe blank icon will indicate the __init__.py file contains a script.\n\nThe file icon will show an icon indicating the __init__.py is a folder, which is not a usual default behavior. This is a warning that there may be problems in using it in future files (though it won't hinder the project development now).", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}

{"idx": 469, "text": "B\n\n#### **Explanation:**\n\n\n\nFor this problem statement, the input is a concerto for a clarinet. The output from the user will be either an orchestra or a jazz band. As is given with the word concerto, it is clear that there will be a string ensemble or band as backing instrument. For this a jazz band is probably the most likely option since the word clarinet is not part of classical music and thus you probably wouldn't want a classical group behind you.\n\n\n\n#### **Hints:**\n\nYou can use the function 'type' to perform data analysis on the input. You can use string.split to separate or break up a string. You can use 'contains' to see if a given substring or set of characters is part of a string. You should use the function'reduce' to take the input and split it into a dictionary where you have the main key as the word clarinet. To do this you will need to create the dictionary with input and then perform a for loop which will give you each of the possible words that you may choose from to perform. \n\n\n#### **Solution:**\n\n```python\n  from collections import Counter\n \n  input = \"B\"\n \n  mainKey = 'clarinet'\n \n  result = counter[mainKey]\n \n  if result:\n    result = result.split() #split the dictionary into an array to use the output\n    result.sort() #sort the output based on frequency \n  else:\n    result = Counter(mainKey)\n    result = result__ #copy the dictionary object into the output\n    result = result_.sort() #sort the dictionary object by frequency\n \n  output = \" \".join(result) #join the resulting dictionary into a string", "answer": "B: orchestra"}

It would be returned if the first character was not capital.\n\n\nInput:def\nOutput: -1\n\n### Examples:\n\ndef, -1\nabcdef, -1\n\n\n# Instructions:\n\nGiven a tree, print all possible paths from root to leaf starting from root then printing each node that occurs between each step.\n\nInput:\n\n7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6\n\nOutput:\n\n7, 4, 2, 6\n\n\n### Step1:\nWe define the empty function, and use that to initialize the recursive function. The empty function, in this case will just return nothing. \n\n### Step2:\nThe recursive function defines that the user does nothing to the function, since they have the value of 1 passed to them. The empty function will be used to return nothing, and the node 1 will have to be printed with an empty result. This will be necessary because the path will continue being printed. \n\n## #  Instructions:\nGiven a string, find index of the first character where character is the string in reverse.For example, if the string is 5555, returns 4 since 5 is the first character that occurs in reverse.\n\nInput: 5555\nOutput: 4\n\n\n### Hint:\n\n1) Print a 1 so it is the first character, it will not be printed, and it will not occur in reverse.\n\n2) Print the rest of the characters", "answer": "C: california"}

There is 6 different cases to consider. First, the user input will be compared to each possible answer. Then, based on the answer, the program outputs a greeting. If the input is not in any of the possibilities, the program will print \"other,\" which is the only wrong answer.

If I used strings and ifs, my solution would take up 20% of the space it currently was because Python is very picky on how it handles strings.\n\nIt is much more efficient to write out each case by hand than to have extra ifs to check in strings.\n<hr><br>\n<hr>\n\n```python\ndef program(s):\n    if \"middle\" in  s:\n        return A\n    elif \"palace\"in  s:\n        if \"palce\" in  s or \"place\" in v:\n            return B\n        else:\n            print(\"other\")\n    elif \"dictionary\"in s or \"pots\"in s or \"apartment\"in s:\n        return C\n    elif all(i in s for i in [\"middle\",\"palace\",\"dictionary\",\"pots", "answer": "E: apartment"}

We can get the option and the count then count the `Option` by `for` of each word in the `List`.\n\nThis logic will not work for the choice C in the code below.\n\n```java\nOption option = null;\nString splitString = null;\nfor (int i = 0; i < answer.length; i++) {\n    if (option!= null && option.equals(answer[i])) {\n        //We continue with the second loop\n        //We count each option count of words.\n        continue;\n    }\n    \n    splitString=answer[i].split(\" \")[0];\n    option = option + \" \" + splitString; // option \"meet people\", \"friend\", \"socialize\", \"liquor\"\n}\n\nint counter = 0;\nString[] split = option.split(\" \");\nfor (String str :  split) {\n    counter++;\n}\nSystem.out.println(option[option.length-1])\n```\nBut if we continue with the second loop, it will not count for the choice C that is the option is not matched with current option.\n\n#### B.\n`Split` function with `", "answer": "D: socialize"}

An IPO occurs when a company wants to sell pieces of itself in the form of stocks. By creating more stocks or shares, a lot more money can be obtained. But, this means a lot more money can also be at risk. Another thing to note is that many people tend to think that the public will buy into a stock that makes a lot of profit. But, this is not entirely true, because the public, or the \u201cinvestors\u201d, tend to take into consideration the information about a stock and how well the company is doing financially before purchasing such, and not just the fact that it is a good investment. I feel like this can be especially dangerous especially since it seems like more and more, stock trading is becoming a trend for many young people in the hopes of creating a quick fortune.\n\n\n## Instructions: Answer 2 questions with 1.2 pages of text each.\n\n\n\n### 2nd Question\nThe second question is asking if a company who is looking to become public, can they do so without revealing certain information that they do not want to be revealed. I believe the answer to this question is no. Going public, especially through an IPO, means that more information about your company can be easily obtained by just the public alone. However, many companies do not want to be made known of the specific strategies, or details of their business that could put them at a disadvantage if it leaked to potential competitors.\n\n\n\n\n## How to cite this file:\n\n<pre>\n&lt;i&gt;Instructions:Answer the following multiple answer question.</i> <em>input:</em> <i>Which one of the following is correct?</i> <em>output:</em> <c>A</c> <i>output:</i> <c>B</c> (continued...)\n</pre>", "answer": "D: more funding"}

For this case, we can see that Question and UserInfo are case classes, if in our implementation we want to get data from a case class, and we use it other place, so we must import it, below you can find the import statement:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.util._\nimport scala.collection.immutable._\nimport scala.language.implicitConversions\nimport scala.util.control._\nimport scala.annotation._\nimport scala.util.~>\nimport scala.reflect._\nimport scala.scalajs.js\nimport scalaz._\nimport scalaz._,scalaz.syntax._\n```\nthen in the following code, we will use the Question and UserInfo case classes, \n\n```scala\n case class Question(name:String, answers:String, userInfo: UserInfo)\n \n val q1 = Question(\"What?\", \"relax, dream, or have nightmare\", userInfo(\"John\",26))\n \n import scala.util.control~>\n // this will import the question and userinfo case class\n // case class and other case classes like the question and userInfo require implicit conversions\n // from case class and to case class, we cannot convert case class to another class if they are defined in different class, \n // for example, you cannot convert java.util.List to case class UserInfo if UserInfo is in another class\n // so we need to use implicit conversions, for more information see the implicit conversions in scala document\n\n// we use the case class userInfo to represent a set of users who used the app, \n// in this implementation it used to store name and age, \n// we can see that the import statement has two", "answer": "D: restlessness"}

{"idx": 975, "text": "Who\nExplanation: A: builders B. Driver C. Driver D. Architect E: Driver\n\n### Answer:\nBuilders\n\n\n### Instruction:Choose the correct answer among the following answer option.\n\n\n\nFor a building, we must make sure that they are safe and strong enough to hold.\nIf we are designing a building, we must consider many points such as the weight of bricks, concrete, plastic and many more. If we are building the building, we must first decide whether it will be a one-story or a two-story or high-rise building (depending upon how many stories the building will have).\n\n\n### Answer :\nAns:\nFirstly, we need to decide whether we are making one or two-storey building or high-rise buildings (depending upon how high the building is). Building with many storeys can have the option of a staircase or an elevator. If we are making high-rise buildings, we must consider the building's structure since they are very tall and thus, more important to be sturdy.\n\nWe should also keep in mind what material that will be used to build the building such as bricks, clay, stones, wood and many more.\n\n### Instructions:Choose the correct option.\n\n\n### Ans:\nAns:\n\n\n### Description:Which one of the following is used to control buildings? Choices:  a. stairs b. screws c. bolts d. none of above\n\n\n### Choose the correct answer:There is a building with four stairs which each stair consists of 14 steps and 25 centres of rotation. There are 739 steps and 1,150 centres of rotation.What is the total number of steps and centres of rotation that will be needed to control building? Choices: a. 1,154 b. 1,149 c. 1,469 d. 1,549\n\n\n### Answers:\nAns:Ans: Option D. 1,559. If you divide the value of no of stairs(739) by 14 it will be 52. Similarly you can calculate the value", "answer": "C: architect"}

Then assign a \"default value\" to those variable so that as you solve each step, you make sure you give it the correct answer the \"input\" variable gives, and the same answer the \"output\" variable gives. This helps by making sure every step you take is a step forward. If the \"default value\" and the end \"output\" aren't equal, then you've not solved the puzzle yet, and you have to try again.\n\nI have to assume from the beginning that the \"default value\" variable is set to the same answer the \"Output\" variable gives. That way every puzzle I've ever solved and will ever solve will work the same way I have solved it. Just in case. I can always go through and debug it at a later point to make sure if I am doing it correctly.\n\n**Step1:** Create an \"input\" and an \"output\" variable. Both give the same variable at the same time, they are just a way to keep track so that by the end we match the input with the output.\n**Step2:** Set up an \"default value\" variable. Like so input:110 output:220 default:33\n**Step3:**", "answer": "B: welcome change"}

Check if a 2-digit number is even or odd\n 2. Find the sum of 2 integers using recursion\n 3. Find a sum of digits in a 2-digits integer (eg. 123 becomes 1+2 = 3)\n 4. The longest length of a word after removing consecutive vowels\n \n \n \n### Input:\nIn this task, each input will consist of a 2-digit integer. \nFor example, '05' should be parsed into '05'.\nYou'll be provided with a total of 75 inputs.\n\n\n### Output:\nFor each of the 2-digit integer input, you will provide the sum for odd or even numbers.\nYou will provide the sum using recursion. \n\nExample:\n\nInput: 06\nOdd / Even: 6\n\nRecursion is where you can call a function and return a value. For example, if you add one to the previous return value and return that value instead of returning nothing, you can create a recursion.\n\nFor this exercise, you would use tail call recursion to solve the problem. Tail call recursion is a way to recursively call a procedure. It will pass the return address to the callee instead of the return value and that's why this solution works.\n\nIn this problem, you will be given a 2-digit string and your function would simply be a sum and you will return a sum for even or odd.\n\n### Recursion:\nIn general, a recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. \nA tail recursive call will execute the callee without storing it in a separate variable.\nThe tail recursive function returns itself as an argument, which is then converted to a value using the function's return statement. This converts the recursive call into a normal, non-tail-recursive call, so it doesn't use up memory and doesn't require a stack frame for each call.\n\n### Example:\nThis method uses recursive function to determine if a 2-bit integer is", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

Coffee shops would imply that\npeople are spending time at the coffee shop everyday but that they are not staying for over a period of\n6 hours. The coffee shop can't be the right option because then there would be no need for a person to\nget off of the coffee shop and go home to the family.\n\nSolar system is not the right choice because there can't be anything in the solar system that could\naccurately be the seating. Solar system is used to represent the universe in general.\n\n\nSpace shuttle would imply that the plane would have to take off from the same place each time.

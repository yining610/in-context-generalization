Choices:  A: picnic B: friend's house C: table D: space shuttle E: fairgrounds<n>Output:		The answer should be 'D'.<n><n><n><n>### Solution:<n><n><n>```java<n>    String word = "gettogether";<n>    if (word.startsWith("g") && word.endsWith( "ing ")){<n>        System.out.println("A");<n>        return A;<n>    }<n>    if (word == "friends"){<n>        System.out.println("C");<n>        return C;<n>    }<n>     <n>```<n><n>Answer: Here's how I do it:<n><n>The first step is determining which words look suspect and whether they are words at all.  A word can look like an action or it can look like an object.  Either way, I create a set of words to check for these types of words.  I store the words in an array for later checking for the presence of these words.  This array is populated if the string contains an action word (a, an, am), the possessive's, a 'd' or 'ed' suffix.  To prevent errors, I also check for negative words, like 'won't' and 'didn't. <n><n>Then I create another set of words that would be verbs, which include 'is', 'are', 'was', etc. and store them in their own array.<n><n>Finally, I iterate and take the action words in the first array, do a word search on the current string using those action words.  If a word exists, I check to see if it's possessive or an action word.  The possessive words we simply treat as a normal word, so we keep searching to see if the possession is direct or indirect.  If it's indirect the's' will not be capitalized when searching the direct form.  The action words are added to the correct set if they are found and the search for an indirect action word is terminated. <n><n>This is also where the checking for the negative words occurs, after the indirect word is checked for validity.  If the indirect word is valid, then the current word must be the possession and we terminate the search.  If it'e not valid, then we search again after all the negative words are eliminated.<n><n>The second step is checking for the verb.  We iterate through the verb array and do a search for the words.  These verbs are already in lower case and if

The question contains over 10000 words, this should be sufficient hint that this question involves very little search.<n><n>#### Instruction 3:The question contains a large amount of keywords containing many synonyms and some are misspelt. So it is possible that an algorithm used for the solution would give up with time complexity or a keyword match based algorithm would fail. Therefore, you are to find the best matching answer from a list of answer choices generated from all the keywords that are likely to be used in solving the question.<n><n><n>#### Instruction:Write your code in Python on the website. Your code should consist of two classes:<n><n>```<n>class Node<n>  attr:string<n>  parent:Node | null<n>  left:Node | null | Parent<n>  right:Node | null | parent<n>  level:int<n><n>class MyGraph<n>  nodes:Array<Node><n>  edges:Array<int[]><n>```<n><n>Your code should implement the following functions.<n><n>```<n>  function addEdge(start,end,weight:int):void<n>  function levelOrder(start:Node):Array<Node><n>```<n><n>#### Instructions on solving question: <n><n>You should implement a breadth-first search in levelOrder and then create a graph on the fly from the keyword matching set. Each keyword should be an edge in the graph. You can check if the parent is null, the value is not set in levelOrder(parent) and the value is not null, the edge(start, parent) has non null value in the graph and use that value to traverse right and left, the parent node is null in the graph or not set in levelOrder function or not null in the graph.<n><n>#### Instruments:<n>1.

Choices: <n>A: illiterate B; knowledgable<n>C: own house D; have enough food<n>E: meet expectations<n><n>Output:C<n><n><n><n><n>The question asks you to write a script. In order to do this, you need some information about the script that Python understands. <n>This information is stored in a file called __init__.py__ which must exist at the root (top) of the folder for each module. <n><n>Let's make a simple script file to demonstrate some of the information it contains and use relative paths to import modules. <n><n>In the root folder of our project, start a new file called __init__. <n><n>```python<n>import random<n>import sys<n>print('Hello {}'.format(sys.argv[1]))<n>```<n><n>The __init__.py file exists as a file only in projects that contain Python scripts. If there is no __init__.py file present at the root of a project, the OS will treat it as a directory instead. <n><n>The __init__ file should contain a blank line at the beginning to indicate it should not be interpreted as Python code.<n><n>You can see the difference by navigating to the folder containing the project. For Windows, you can use the Windows Explorer File Manager or Command Line. Mac has a Finder and a Terminal. For Linux, navigating with the Command Line is common. <n><n>When viewing the folder through the Command Line, type cd then the folder name. When navigating through the Explorer, Right Click the folder and go to Properties to view the Shortcut.<n><n>If there is a __init__.py file, it's usually easy to tell by the icon in the folder. <n><n>In both cases, the icon to the right of the file name indicates it's a file.<n><n>Mac, Linux and Windows all show a file icon.<n><n>Windows also shows a folder or blank icon depending on if the folder contains other files.<n><n>The blank icon will indicate the __init__.py file contains a script.<n><n>The file icon will show an icon indicating the __init__.py is a folder, which is not a usual default behavior. This is a warning that there may be problems in using it in future files (though it won't hinder the project development now).<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:A musician is most likely to perform a concerto for clarinet with what type of group? Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n>Output:		B<n><n>#### **Explanation:**<n><n><n><n>For this problem statement, the input is a concerto for a clarinet. The output from the user will be either an orchestra or a jazz band. As is given with the word concerto, it is clear that there will be a string ensemble or band as backing instrument. For this a jazz band is probably the most likely option since the word clarinet is not part of classical music and thus you probably wouldn't want a classical group behind you.<n><n><n><n>#### **Hints:**<n><n>You can use the function 'type' to perform data analysis on the input. You can use string.split to separate or break up a string. You can use 'contains' to see if a given substring or set of characters is part of a string. You should use the function'reduce' to take the input and split it into a dictionary where you have the main key as the word clarinet. To do this you will need to create the dictionary with input and then perform a for loop which will give you each of the possible words that you may choose from to perform. <n><n><n>#### **Solution:**<n><n>```python<n>  from collections import Counter<n> <n>  input = "B"<n> <n>  mainKey = 'clarinet'<n> <n>  result = counter[mainKey]<n> <n>  if result:<n>    result = result.split() #split the dictionary into an array to use the output<n>    result.sort() #sort the output based on frequency <n>  else:<n>    result = Counter(mainKey)<n>    result = result__ #copy the dictionary object into the output<n>    result = result_.sort() #sort the dictionary object by frequency<n> <n>  output = " ".join(result) #join the resulting dictionary into a string

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Why would a company be going public? Choices:  A: revealing information B: being ridiculed C: problems D: more funding E: telling all<n>Output:		A  B  C  D  E <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions with 1.5 to 2 pages of text.<n><n><n>Answer: <n>## The first 3 questions are the same, so I only answered the first one to cut down the total.<n><n><n>### First Question<n>The first question requires us to think about the financial implications of a business going public. An IPO occurs when a company wants to sell pieces of itself in the form of stocks. By creating more stocks or shares, a lot more money can be obtained. But, this means a lot more money can also be at risk. Another thing to note is that many people tend to think that the public will buy into a stock that makes a lot of profit. But, this is not entirely true, because the public, or the “investors”, tend to take into consideration the information about a stock and how well the company is doing financially before purchasing such, and not just the fact that it is a good investment. I feel like this can be especially dangerous especially since it seems like more and more, stock trading is becoming a trend for many young people in the hopes of creating a quick fortune.<n><n><n>## Instructions: Answer 2 questions with 1.2 pages of text each.<n><n><n><n>### 2nd Question<n>The second question is asking if a company who is looking to become public, can they do so without revealing certain information that they do not want to be revealed. I believe the answer to this question is no. Going public, especially through an IPO, means that more information about your company can be easily obtained by just the public alone. However, many companies do not want to be made known of the specific strategies, or details of their business that could put them at a disadvantage if it leaked to potential competitors.<n><n><n><n><n>## How to cite this file:<n><n><pre><n>&lt;i&gt;Instructions:Answer the following multiple answer question.</i> <em>input:</em> <i>Which one of the following is correct?</i> <em>output:</em> <c>A</c> <i>output:</i> <c>B</c> (continued...)<n></pre><n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:What prevents someone from getting sleep at night? Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n>Output:		C, answer: d.<n><n><n>For this question, you can consider multiple-choice questions by changing it to a case class.<n><n>```scala<n>case class Question(name: String,answers: String,userInfo: UserInfo) extends Serializable<n>val question1 = Question("What", "relax, dreams, have nightmares, restlessness or snore", UserInfo("John", 26))<n>```<n><n>#### Code Explanation:<n><n>Firstly, you need import case class, because in scala case classes require implicit conversions from case classes and to case classes, so we cannot do implicit conversions to case classes in other classes. For this case, we can see that Question and UserInfo are case classes, if in our implementation we want to get data from a case class, and we use it other place, so we must import it, below you can find the import statement:<n><n>```scala<n>import scala.util._<n>import scala.collection.immutable._<n>import scala.language.implicitConversions<n>import scala.util.control._<n>import scala.annotation._<n>import scala.util.~><n>import scala.reflect._<n>import scala.scalajs.js<n>import scalaz._<n>import scalaz._,scalaz.syntax._<n>```<n>then in the following code, we will use the Question and UserInfo case classes, <n><n>```scala<n> case class Question(name:String, answers:String, userInfo: UserInfo)<n> <n> val q1 = Question("What?", "relax, dream, or have nightmare", userInfo("John",26))<n> <n> import scala.util.control~><n> // this will import the question and userinfo case class<n> // case class and other case classes like the question and userInfo require implicit conversions<n> // from case class and to case class, we cannot convert case class to another class if they are defined in different class, <n> // for example, you cannot convert java.util.List to case class UserInfo if UserInfo is in another class<n> // so we need to use implicit conversions, for more information see the implicit conversions in scala document<n><n>// we use the case class userInfo to represent a set of users who used the app, <n>// in this implementation it used to store name and age, <n>// we can see that the import statement has two

Then assign a "default value" to those variable so that as you solve each step, you make sure you give it the correct answer the "input" variable gives, and the same answer the "output" variable gives. This helps by making sure every step you take is a step forward. If the "default value" and the end "output" aren't equal, then you've not solved the puzzle yet, and you have to try again.<n><n>I have to assume from the beginning that the "default value" variable is set to the same answer the "Output" variable gives. That way every puzzle I've ever solved and will ever solve will work the same way I have solved it. Just in case. I can always go through and debug it at a later point to make sure if I am doing it correctly.<n><n>**Step1:** Create an "input" and an "output" variable. Both give the same variable at the same time, they are just a way to keep track so that by the end we match the input with the output.<n>**Step2:** Set up an "default value" variable. Like so input:110 output:220 default:33<n>**Step3:** <n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:What often happens after a long day of traveling? Choices:  A: sickness B: motion sickness C: relocation D: jet lag E: fatigue<n>Output:		A<n>### Code description:<n>### Explanation:<n><n> <n> <n> ### Instruction:Answer my Python assignment<n> ### Note:<n> Write a code for this 4 instruction.<n> 1. Check if a 2-digit number is even or odd<n> 2. Find the sum of 2 integers using recursion<n> 3. Find a sum of digits in a 2-digits integer (eg. 123 becomes 1+2 = 3)<n> 4. The longest length of a word after removing consecutive vowels<n> <n> <n> <n>### Input:<n>In this task, each input will consist of a 2-digit integer. <n>For example, '05' should be parsed into '05'.<n>You'll be provided with a total of 75 inputs.<n><n><n>### Output:<n>For each of the 2-digit integer input, you will provide the sum for odd or even numbers.<n>You will provide the sum using recursion. <n><n>Example:<n><n>Input: 06<n>Odd / Even: 6<n><n>Recursion is where you can call a function and return a value. For example, if you add one to the previous return value and return that value instead of returning nothing, you can create a recursion.<n><n>For this exercise, you would use tail call recursion to solve the problem. Tail call recursion is a way to recursively call a procedure. It will pass the return address to the callee instead of the return value and that's why this solution works.<n><n>In this problem, you will be given a 2-digit string and your function would simply be a sum and you will return a sum for even or odd.<n><n>### Recursion:<n>In general, a recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. <n>A tail recursive call will execute the callee without storing it in a separate variable.<n>The tail recursive function returns itself as an argument, which is then converted to a value using the function's return statement. This converts the recursive call into a normal, non-tail-recursive call, so it doesn't use up memory and doesn't require a stack frame for each call.<n><n>### Example:<n>This method uses recursive function to determine if a 2-bit integer is

Choices:  A: train station B: bookstore C: newsstand D: waiting room E: airport<n>Output:		A: train station<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>#### Option:<n><n>There are more choices here the waiting room is the closest choice to this question however this is not the correct answer. I think its more likely that this kind of magazine is a read in a waiting room or a waiting station or a airport. Therefore i think the answer is: A: train station ( waiting station ), however this is just a logical argument and might not really satisfy your logic that the magazine gets to be read somewhere other than train station <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below in detail.<n><n>Input:A magazine where while waiting for bus/train station. Choices:  A train B public bus C private bus D subway E None of the above<n>Output: A train<n><n>#### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question below<n><n>Input:A book where while waiting for school bus to arrive? Choices A: train station B public school C private school D subway E train station <n>Output: private school<n><n>#### Explanaton:<n><n>In the first question we discussed that train station seemed to be an option however this time around since we dont have the same answer train station is not an option. Furthermore, since we are speaking in terms of school buses and waiting for school buses i dont think trains are what would be read on. I believe the answer is private school even though the question is confusing and in my opinion a lot of people might think it is C.<n><n>#### Explanatation:<n><n>Since the book belongs to a school, the correct answer to the second question is private school. Since the answer to the second question and the 3rd question are very similar, i will briefly explain why i think the 3rd question is correct ( and similar to the 2nd question ) and why i think the 4th question is wrong.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

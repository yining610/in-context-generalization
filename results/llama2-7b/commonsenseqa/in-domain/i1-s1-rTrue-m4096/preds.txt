Choices:  A: pretty flowers. B: hen house C: natural habitat D: storybook E: dense forest<n>Output:		<n>1. The fox walked from the City into the Forest, What was it looking for?<n>2. The context of the question indicates that the fox was walking from the city into the Forest.<n>3. Option B: Hen House: A henhouse is not a forest and would be a strange location for a fox to find flowers.<n>4. Option C: Natural Habitat. It is unlikely that the fox would go in search of food in its natural habitat and would be unlikely to find flowers there.<n>5. Option D: Storybook: This is a reference to a child's book and is outside the scope of the question.<n>6. To answer the question, we need to consider option C, and it is clear that the "dense forest" is the natural habitat of the fox.<n>7. There is thus a much higher chance of the fox encountering flowers in the forest. The correct answer is C: dense forest<n><n><n><n><n>

However, not all blotters are absorbent when wet, it is important to check the store's information to avoid buying a blotter that might not work. Ink blotter paper is a popular choice among calligraphers because it is an inexpensive way to absorb ink without needing water or a damp surface area.

Choices:  A: backyard B: restaurant C: crockpot D: neighbor's house E: barbeque<n>Output:		1 The question is asking what is it called when you slow cook using a grill. 2 This is asking what word is used to describe the act of cooking slowly using a grill.<n>3 Option A: backyard. It would describe the activity where the grilling is done in someone’s backyard. There is no mention of how this cooking is done. It is safe to answer that option A is the correct answer.<n>4 Option B: restaurant. This would be correct for a restaurant that has an eatery where they do outdoor grilling.<n>5 Option C: crockpot. Crockpots are usually used for slow cooking food and so this may not adequately describe the act of cookery with a grill. It appears likely that this is the correct answer, but I can't be sure of it.<n>6 Option D: neighbor's home. This can refer to cooking done in your neighbor’s backyard, but it would also be used if you were describing someone who slow cooked their meat in their neighbor’s home, but I believe the best answer for this question is B: restaurant.<n>7 Option E: Barbecue. This would be an acceptable answer under any of the circumstances because all of these things are used for cooking. This could potentially be a correct answer, but I believe other answers are more likely.<n><n>---<n><n>### Instruction: The following questions are asked using Google Translate.<n><n>1.

Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

Choices:  A: in the basement B: west C: solar system D: beach E: beans<n>Output:		1: The question is asking what is a great place to lie in the sun. 2. Let's consider all the choices individually. 3. Choice A: in the basements. There is not any sunlight in basements so it is not a great place to lie. 4. Choice B: West. The West has mostly land so there is not so much place for you to sunbathe. 5. Choice C: solar system. The solar system is also not a great place to sunbathe because there are planets that face a very harsh environment. Furthermore, no known planet in our solar system receives sunlight at all times. 6. Choice D: beach. Beach is great place to lye because there is lots of sunlight and sand. 7. Choice E: Beans. We can not call beans as a great place in the sun. Beans absorb water so do not have enough sun and we can not call them as a great place in sunlight.

As an obvious choice, the correct answer would be one of those reasons: getting smart, boredom, colds and flu, and taking tests.<n>2: The question does not ask for reasons not to attend school, so we need not consider answer choices C: colds and E: spend time.<n>3: The question does not specifically call out any particular reason as "good", so we cannot rule out answer choice B: boredom.<n>4: The sentence "After considering all the options, we see that A: getting smart is the only reason that can be considered a 'good' one." states that answer choice A: getting smart is a good reason for attendance, not that it is the only good one. Therefore, no other answer can be the correct answer.<n>5: After considering all the given choices, the correct answer would therefore be B: boredom - a good reason to attend a school.<n><n>### Test your model<n>```<n>input: A: Getting smart is a good reason to attend college C: Getting smart is the only reason to attend college D: Good idea if you were to attend college E: Good idea as long as you attended college.<n>input: A: Take these tests B: Go to college C: Do a better job C: Get a better education<n>input: A: Earn more money B: Enjoy learning C: Learn more advanced math concepts<n>output: 1. The first sentence is asking whether A: earning more money or B: doing a better job is a good reason for a person to attend college. We know that the question does not specify whether earning more money is a good reason or a bad reason, and therefore, we cannot exclude answer choice B.<n>2. The second sentence is asking whether C: getting a better education or D: doing a better jobis a good reason for a student to attend college. Here, the first sentence had already excluded answer choice C: getting a better job. This fact rules out option C and leaves us with the option that C: getting a better idea is the best answer.<n>3. The third sentence is similar to the second sentence and can be answered with the same logic. The option A: get smart is the best answer.

Choices:  a: get water b: get petrol c: get electricity d: none e: get oil <n>Output: 1) The question is asking what option would be the best, if any.<n>2) We then need to evaluate each of the options.<n>3) Option A: "get water" would not be the best solution, because it may not be possible to get drinkable water.<n>4) Option B "get petrol" would not be the optimal choice because it would have to be paid for.<n>5) Option C "Get electricity" is an example of something that is not a choice between options, but more of a general answer. Electricity is something that is available in houses and we can get it from our utility companies, there is no other option where we would get electricity other than from an electric company.<n>6) Option D "None" is not the best option, because we should always try to get the best option if there is one.<n>7) Option E: "Get oil" is the best option if there was no other option. "Get oil" means that we would either get oil to use in our homes, or
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:The man went to clown college, he had always want to run away with the what?

Choices:  A: factory B: construction site C: engine D: insides of skyscraper's walls E: shops<n>Output:		1. The question is about a workman who had tripped over a rod while building somewhere.<n>2. The question does not specify the context of work for the workman. We can only make assumptions through various possibilities.<n>3. Option "A: Factory" is the only one where we can assume that the workman was on site.<n>4. Option "B: Construction Site" would suggest the workman was at a construction site, but in most cases construction sites do not include any piping systems or plumbing, so this is not suitable as a choice.<n>5. Option "C: Engine" is not suitable as it doesn't specify if the engine is onsite or not. We can also say that "D:Insides of Skyscraper's Walls" are also unlikely places where plumbing is kept and this is a less likely option by the nature of skyscraper construction material.<n>6. Option "E: Shops" could be an unlikely option if we think about the location of plumbing within a shop. They might not have any piping system if they don't have a cash register or restroom to use.<n>7. We would be left with option "C: Engine" as the only possible choice where the workman could have tripped over a rod.<n>So the final answers is C: Engine<n><n>Input: How can you use water for a small kitchen project? Choices: 1. Heat to 38°C or boil and let cool<n>2. Heat to 60°C<n>3. Heat to 80°C<n>4. Heat to over 100°C<n>5. Put in bucket of water to heat by absorption<n>Output: In this case, the instructions don’t provide any other information about what the “small kitchen project” would be.<n>1. We could use water for a small project involving heating. However, this is not a safe process as we could get scalded or be burned due to high temperatures involved in the process.<n>2. We could use water in a way where the process involves temperatures of 60 degrees C. However, this is still risky as we might get burned due to the water being heated too high.<n>3. We could use water by using temperatures of 80 degrees C. This is still risky

Choices:  A: store B: classroom C: backpack D: cabinet E: teacher<n>Output:		1 The question is where a student would go to get some new pencil.<n>2. We consider each of the options.<n>3. Choice A: store. A student usually buys his or her new school supplies, such as pencils, in a store.<n>4. Choice B: classroom. In a classroom setting, teachers usually keep a box or shelf in a corner where students can get new pencils.<n>5. Choice C: backpack. Students normally keep a pencil case or a tube which keeps some pencils in it. A student might need new pencils in his backpack if he needs to use those pencils in class.<n>6. Choice D: cabinet. If the student belongs to a school that has a cabinet with pencils, he would get the pencils from the cabinet.<n>7. Choice E: teacher. The teacher can also give a student a new pencil if he runs out of pencils.<n>8. After taking into account all the available options, we conclude that Choice A: The store is the sole choice that indicates where a student will go to get new pencils as the store is the only place where he can buy them.<n>So the final Answer is A: Store<n><n>Input:The boy’s house is located on the east street.

We would now consider the different choices as below;<n>3. Option A. North/South. We should not say North or South because that is an ambiguous term without further context or description.<n>4. Option E. North/Was West. That may mean the boy is moving from one house to a house that used to be his house.<n>5. Option B: East/West. We should not say East or West because they are ambiguous terms without further context or description, though we can say that he is moving away from his old house.<n>6. Option C:  East: The boy is moving from one place, i.e. (old) house on the east street to another place, that is (new)  house (on the same street) on the east street

Choices: A. Smelling B. Tasting C. Hearing D. Touching<n>Output: 1). We consider each option.<n>2). Option A. Smelling. The sense of smell can potentially let you know when you are running low on toilet paper if your sense of smell is heightened enough.<n>3). Option B. Tasting. Tasting requires that something physically touches your tongue. The toilet paper cannot literally "run out" since it does not change it consistency like water might. Touching is not an option since something would have to physically touch you (and it wouldn't be a scent)<n>4). Option C. Hearing. There is no indication that hearing can let you know that you are out of toilet roll.<n>5). Option D. Touching. Like toilet paper not actually running out, the paper itself is not tactile, and it does not make a sound.<n><n>Input: Which animal eats, sleeps, and lives in the same location as people? Choices

Choices:  A: desk drawer B: desktop C: office D: wristwatch E: city hall<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where the accountant kept a calculator regular, which means the accountant uses a calculator regularly.<n>2) We then consider each of five given options.<n>3) Option A: "desk drawer". In a desk drawer, we find various common supplies such as pens, staplers, and maybe another calculator, but most probably it does not contain drinking water.<n>4) Option B: "desktop". The desktop is actually a flat surface above the drawers on which we can find a wristwatch, pens, staplers and other items but not drinking water.<n>5) Option C: "office". If the accountant's office is a large company, there are many office buildings around. But if the accountant's work is like a bookkeeper, there might be only one accounting office and maybe only one desk in the office. But it is almost impossible to find clean drinking water in a working office environment.<n>6) Option D: "wristwatch" may be used by some but may not be used by all. And it is also not the main focus point of the question.<n>7) Option E: "city hall" The "city" we are talking here is not geographical city where are all the common supplies and there are many buildings with many desks. But it is more like a virtual city in social media, an electronic bulletin board where lots of people gather together to share their stuff. Therefore, it is improbable that the accountant uses a city hall to keep his or her calculator.<n>8) After considering all the options we see that the only place where the accountant may keep a calculator regularly is "office" because there a lot of desks where we can place a calculator regular for use. Hence the correct answer is C: office<n><n>Input: Why would he not look at the weather before buying some strawberries when he could easily tell how the rest of the crop was? Choices: 1.

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n>Output:		1._In the choices, C_ is the correct answer because the text describes the pinch as being something “a lot of people hate.” The word ‘clammy’ is the antonym of ‘comfortable’ (the word used to describe pinching with your hands).<n>2._To decide the answer, think about this question: why do people hate a lot of things? The obvious word missing when you think about hating is _uncomfortable_. Therefore, the phrase ‘feel clammy’ is the most likely answer.<n>3._The other options (which involve skin getting hot or cold or itching) are not as common. Most people don't feel hot skin when they get pinched either consciously or subconsciously.<n>4._Therefore, the best answer is C_Clammy_.<n><n>Input: Can one person be bored if they are in a room with 160 people? Choices: A: Yes B: No<n>Output:1._Yes_ is the correct answer as the text itself says, A person could experience boredom in a room of that size.<n>2._If everyone in the room is playing Tetris at full blast, then they aren't actually bored, so the room can't be boring. That's not the case at a job interview.<n>3._It may be true that the room is dull, or plain, but those are all relative descriptions. It's possible to think a room is boring when it isn't boring to everyone else in the room.<n>4._When trying to determine whether 160 people could be bored in a room, the answer is Yes.<n><n>Input: How many people do the majority of people like?

Option  B: home. A cat is happiest when it has a place to call its own, and being at home is its natural habitat.<n>5. Option  C: alley. This option refers to the place where a cat may live, but it also needs to consider that in an alley, it might be easy to get away from predators compared to being in its home.<n>6. Option  D: lap. This is where a cat may happily be while being picked up by its owner, but it is not its happiest place to be.<n>7. Option  E: barn. A barn is where the cat might be housed, but the question asks where the cat would be happiest, so it should not be the final answer.<n>8.

This can cause a cactii cacti to lose leaves, so the option can be considered correct.<n>4. Option c) frost. This can cause cactii cactii to lose the leaves, so it also fits the question, making the option correct.<n>5. Option d) touch. This is a common misconception of cactii cactoids, but cactii cactuses do not lose leaves if they are touched unless they are broken. So, this option does not fit into the question, making it

There are multiple options that could fit.<n>3. Option B: hot country.<n>The question asks about a snake found in his what, and if we consider hot climate, then it might be reasonable to assume that it was a type of constricting snake. One example of such a type is a boa constrictor, whose body structure includes pits called "thermo pits," which emit heat that can raise the snake's body temperature to 100° F or hotter. Therefore, the possibility that the snake was found in a hot country is not ruled out.<n>4. Option C: purse. If he is a boy, then perhaps he was holding a snake in a purse or other small container.<n>5. Option E: deep grass. While a deep grass area does not seem particularly hazardous for a snake to be wandering around in, it is possible that the person holding the snake was in a deep grass area, and the snake was not found in the snake's natural habitat. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out.<n><n>6. After considering all the given options, we can conclude that option B, hot country, is the most likely answer.<n>So the final conclusion is B: hot country. <n>

Choices:  a: restaurant C: home b: shelter kitten d: dog park E: pizza shop<n>Output: 1, You are rescuing a cat, not a dog, so dog park must be eliminated.<n>2, The shelter is ruled out because a cat is nowhere near a shelter.<n>3, The restaurant is ruled out because restaurants don't typically offer stray cats for adoption.<n>4, The pizza shop will obviously be eliminated because pizza shops don't typically find stray cats in their vicinity.<n>5, The home option remains, but your home might not have stray cats available for you to adopt or rescue.<n>6, Based on the answer to #1, restaurants are out of the picture.<n>7, Similarly, the shelter is out of contention because you didn't adopt or rescue him from a shelter.<n>8, The home choice is the only one left (as long as you do not live in a shelter), and it is the best option to be accepted, so you do not need to go any further.<n><n>Input: How many beans are in a pod?

Option B: control events: This choice suggests that the people in class could control events or actions by using their minds, which is an improbable scenario as the mind is not capable of directly controlling the physical world.<n>4. Option C: talk to each and other: this would require the use of the mouth and vocal cords and may lead to increased brain activity, but it is unlikely that the brain would be engaged in a particularly meaningful or intelligent way.<n>5. Option D: think creatively: This choice suggests that thinking creatively would engage the brain in a meaningful and intelligent way.<n>6. Option E: dress themselves: this choice is less likely to engage the brain in any meaningful way as it is a simple and non-creative task.<n>7. Overall, the answer can be inferred from the context of the question and the information given, which leads to conclusion that option D: think creatively would be the most likely answer.<n>8. The activity mentioned in the question can be achieved through different ways, out of which thinking creatively is more likely to engage the mind to a meaningful extent.<n>9. Considering the context, options A, C and E are wrong, as they are unlikely to engage the mind in a meaningful way and option B cannot be concluded with sufficient evidence, leading to conclusion that option D, think creatively should be selected as the right answer.<n><n>Input: If you are planning a night away from home with friends, which of the following would be essential?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If you've thrown a rod you've done damage to what? Choices:  A: fishing camp B: hardware store C: engine D: your spine E: sporting goods store<n>Output:		11. A rod is a component of an engine and if it has been damaged, the engine can no longer function properly.<n>22. Your spine is not actually used by hardware stores or fishing camps, so the wording of the question is not clear on what it actually refers to.<n>33. A sporting goods store is someplace where you would be able to purchase equipment to use for sports. While a damaged rod might allow you to play golf, this is not the main focus of the question.<n>44. The fishing camp might be a place where you can purchase sport fishing equipment.<n>55. Hardware stores are typically places where you can purchase tools and equipment to repair your home.<n>66. The engine is the main focus of the issue.<n>77. So the correct answer would be answer D: "engine", as the rod is a component of the engine and this is where it has been damaged.<n>Input: What animal is always hungry? Choices: 11. cat B: lion 2: camel C: elephant D: monkey 34. deer 45. dog 56. rabbit 67. cow 78. goat 99. horse 1010. hippo 1111. pig<n>Output: This question is ambiguous because it does not specify how "always" is defined.<n><n>The following answer represents the most common use of "always" in context. I can think of many more creative ways for a person to always be hungry (e.g, being in a coma). Therefore, the answer should not be A: cat.<n>7. This answer does seem more likely, but there are several scenarios where I might be able to define when I am considered to be constantly hungry (exercise, strenuous job, etc.).<n>8. B: lion is correct as they are always hungry, no matter where in the world they are on the food chain.<n>9. C: elephant is again correct, as elephants in the wild do generally eat all day, every day. <n>10. D: monkey is incorrect as they are always eating, but not always hungry.<n>11. Deer are in the same situation as the monkey, as they are always eaten,

Choices:  A: boat B: ocean C: pond D: end of line E: ocean<n>Output:		1: The question is asking where kids may find fish in their backyard.<n>2: We consider each of the given option.<n>3: Option A: boats. The fish are located in the ocean, not in the boat.<n>4: Option B: ocean. The fishes do not appear in the backyard they are actually found in the oceans.<n>5: Option C: pond. In most cases, the ponds in the backyard would not hold any fish. The only place where one can find fish is ocean<n>6: Option D: end of line. The fishes cannot be found here as they are located in ocean and not in the end of line.

Choices:  A: getting fat B: get fat C: typing words D: falling asleep E: wasted time<n>Output:		1 If you are watching television and accomplish nothing,<n>2. We then check each of the given option to find out if it is possible to accomplish nothing while watching TV.<n>3. First, option A: getting fat. It is possible to get fat if you eat while watching TV.<n>4. Option A: get fat. You can't really accomplish nothing while getting fat<n>5. Option B. Typing words. Getting fat is not at all what we are interested in.<n>6. Option C. Falling asleep. Sleeping is more like a side-effect or a consequence of watching TV rather than an accomplishment.<n>7. Option D. Wasted time. This may be true for some people but accomplishing nothing is also a possibility<n>8. After considering each option, it becomes clear that option A, getting fat, is the only possible choice. But here you may find it tricky that the sentence mentions accomplishing nothing. To get rid of confusion, let me give you a better phrase. Say, "Accomplishing nothing while spending time in front of a TV". You can't do nothing for sure. However, the phrase is still vague to answer. But it doesn't really matter because you have eliminated all other options.<n>Finally the correct answer is A: getting fat<n>

Option A "Desk drawer" does not provide a clear answer as if John has a few pencils with him on his desk he would not need to go to the desk drawer to get more.<n>4. Option<n><n>B "CUP" is not the answer because if John ran out of pencil, he would not go to his cup to get more pencil. He would use already filled cup.<n>5. Option D "SHELF" is not the answer either because if John ran out pencil, he will not go to his shelf to get more pencill because if some of his pencils are on the shelf, he can use that pencil and if none of the pencils on the shelf are on the desk drawer, he should have it on his shelf.<n>6. Option E "Office Depot" is the correct answer because if John gets the pencils somewhere from the office depot so he can buy the pencils in case he run out of pencils or in the case if John is going to buy something else and he want pencils too.

Choices:  A: michigan B: wyoming C: mississippi D: tennessee E: mississippi<n>Output:		<n>The question is asking which state is the location of the governor's office.<n>1. The question does not specify what a "governor" is. We can assume it is a governor with the state of Mississippi because that is one of the possible states that can be associated with the question.<n>2. The first option that can be eliminated is Mississippi. The context of the sentence indicates that we are looking for a governor, and since there can only be one governor per state, it would not make sense to have two states with the same name.<n>3. The next options to consider are Michigan and Tennessee. These are the only other states that start with M, so eliminating these options leaves Wyoming and Mississippi as potential options.<n>4. We then look at the second part of the question, which is the name of a popular city. This eliminates Wyoming since it has no city named Jackson.<n>5. We next look at the other two options, which are states that start with M and end with J. This narrows down our options to Mississippi only.<n>6. Therefore, the final answer is the state of Mississippi.

Nope, not this one unless the restaurant has a holy purpose, like a restaurant in a church.<n>4: Option B: basement. Could there be floors in a basement used for holy purposes? Sounds like it might be a little impractical, but if it' a church basement, perhaps the kitchen/dining area might house such floors for the congregation.<n>5: Option C: all buildings. The plumbing could take water into buildings for cleaning floors where people are working, and the water is returned clean afterward, which might work in factories or warehouses where they don't use or clean the water.<n>6: Option D: carpet. Hmm, good point, although carpets are used in houses and a lot of people may be thirsty. So this, at least on the surface, may sound more logical.<n>7: Option E: synagogue.

In this case, the shop should give you what you bought, not the downtown area. In a shop, goods are bought and sold, and therefore "what" is given for your purchases. However, there cannot be "what" in the downtown area because "what" is only relevant for objects that can be found in a shop.<n>3)Option B, container, is the most logical choice, whereby goods are stored and transported. In this case, you will get "what" as an item for your purchases because the container can hold "what".<n>4)Option C, ocean floor, is also an acceptable answer. This is a reasonable choice for option C where there could be hidden pirate treasure, and thus one could take whatever one finds as "what" for their purchases.<n>5)Option D, the lost city of Atlantis, cannot be given as the correct answer as there are no shops to buy things in Atlantis because it no longer exists.<n>6)Option E, high school, is also unsuitable because there are no markets or shops to buy things at a high school.<n>After considering all the options and taking the context of the question into account, the only sensible answer to get "what" for your purchases is B: container.<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

Option B, cross road, does very little to help us, and is not the answer.<n>7. Option C, drink your coffee, may be possible, but may not be as effective as option a.<n>8. Option D, driving your vehicle, may be a good option, but again, not a guarantee that you will feel more alert.<n>9. It can be argued that while some of the options may help us feel more alert, option a (thinking critically) is the only answer that can say for certain that you will be alert after thinking critically.<n>Therefore, the final answer is A (think critically).<n><n>Input: What will a bird do when is in the snow?

It may get so wet that it can't fly or climb trees to get out of the bad conditions. <n><n>9: No, this is a bad idea for two reasons: it might not freeze, but it would still be very cold and get wet, not to mention it could still run into other dangers such as predators. In short, this is not a smart or safe choice.<n>

Choices:  A: matchwinning B: cash in C: compete D: return E: celebrate<n>Output:		The gambler had been losing a lot, so what else would he do?<n>1. We first rephrase the question into a statement: "the gambler has been losing a lot".<n>2. In this case, the gambler has been loosing too much since his first bet.<n>3. We know that the gambler can only win if he places a bet with all his remaining money that he has.<n>4. So the outcome has more than one possibility (win or lose).<n>5. The gambler would either choose to stop betting or to continue by using what he has left.<n>6. This is the base rule behind all game theory.<n>7. Option A: Match winning. This doesn't really make sense, as the gambler can not stop at this point, since he would keep loosing all the time. Option B: Cash in. He isn't holding any cash. This is impossible without betting. Option C: Compete. This would require an ongoing winning streak. The gambler's chances are about 0. He has less than nothing to compete. Option D: Return. Now returning would be something the gambler could do, because he would use his winning streaks to return. Option E: Celebrate. This makes no sense, as one has to be cautious with celebrating. Especially when betting.<n>8. To summarize, the gambler should cash in.<n>

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

Therefore, Internet outage is the only phrase that fits the description of this question. 2. B. - this does not fit because the question is talking about electronic communication, not television or radio. 3. C. - this does not answer the question and it does not follow the same context as question 1. 4.

A cash register is a type of device that registers sales, and it is not used to store checks.

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n>Output:		The question is asking what love is when everyone keeps feeling it.We then consider each of the<n>given options.<n><n>Option A: contagious. When two people, who are in love and are also infected by a disease (for instance, TB) feel it, then it may spread to people nearby because they have been infected.<n><n>Option B: wrong. When someone is feeling pain (or a "negative feeling" in general) such as pain, it may not mean they are feeling "love" because many people believe that "love" is "pain" since it brings about extreme happiness (or "pain") that feels like pain.<n><n>Option C: last forever. When someone is feeling "love", it may make them immune to the pain of that feeling for a time period. For example, if they fell in love, they would then be immune to pain for a few months or years, not forever.<n><n>Option D: painful. The question is asking about how love feels when everyone feels it and that, since people are different, how love may be felt differently by everyone. In some cases, people who are in love feel pain (since the feeling is so wonderful to them that it makes it feel terrible at times).<n> Therefore, option D, painful, is a viable answer.<n><n>Option E: blind. The only time the question asks that everyone feels love is when it's referring to blindness. <n>Therefore, option E, blind, is the correct answer.<n>Input: what is the correct pronunciation of the word "tuberculosis"?

Choices:  A: envy B: resentment C: winning or losing D: one winner E: two winners<n>Output:		1st: A. Given the context of the question, "evenly" can only mean "having equal abilities" or "comparable", but not in the sense of "the same". Therefore, A is the correct answer since spectators want to know who the competitors will eventually beat and who will eventually be defeated.<n>2nd: B. As used in the question, resentment is defined as "a feeling of ill-will arising from a sense of injury, insult, or indignity". Since spectators can watch only one team win, the team's victory is the "injury", "insult", or "indignity" of the other team.<n>3rd: C. When the spectators consider that none of the teams wins, the question will probably lead to them asking "who will be the winner (or loser)" when there is only one winner (or any loser for that matter). Answer: D. The question will also ask how many losers there will be when there are more than two competing teams (eg, competing for first, second, or third place), in which case both A, B, and C are relevant.<n><n>Input:You should be careful when eating cheese from this warehouse.

Where would he look? Choices:  A: fish market B: hawaiian waters C: gulf of mexico D: tropical sea E: south pacific ocean<n>Output:		1 The question is asking where Johnny would look for blowfish in locations that are not near America.<n>2. We can eliminate B, C, and D right off the bat since those are all regions relatively close to the United States.<n>3. Of the remaining options, B (i.e. Hawaiian waters) is the most reasonable, since the Gulf of Mexico is within American waters.<n>4. We can be fairly confident that B is the answer. If we eliminate all non-reasonable responses (E, we know Hawaii is part of America and A, we know they're still fish so even outside Americas that are good for them), then B is the only remaining reasonable answer. 5. In the remaining responses, one possible response is option B, and another is option E. 6. The response we can be most confident of is A (outside of America), whereas the response that is not possible under this sentence is B (within America). 7. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

They served their purpose at a point in time, but were replaced by newer technology.)<n>3) Choice C can be eliminated for the same reason.<n>4) Choice D can be eliminated for two reasons:<n>1) the question does not say that the smart phone is the only smart device in use. Therefore, it could be a smart "what," or "device."<n>2) In today's modern world, many offices have multiple computers or electronic "smarts."<n>5) Choice E can be eliminated for this reason:<n>1) Today, many people use their mobile devices for both work and play, therefore, a "work" mobile device is less relevant.<n>6) Option C, "the briefcase," is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: You want to keep a secret and so you decide to write it down. Choices: A: secret B: note C: diary D: book E: computer File<n>Output: 1: The secret can be written in a book, where it would be hard to access by anyone else.<n>2. Choice A: A secret cannot be put into a computer file, as any computer can be accessed by a third party who might be able to see the secret if you store it in a file.<n>3. Choice B. A note can be passed in person from one person to another, but it is harder to ensure its secrecy where it is stored (and if the person who receives it reads it out loud, it would then become known to everyone).<n>4. Choice C. A diary can be accessed by family members who might see the secret. You can write a secret as a note to yourself in a diary, but there remains a risk that a family member could read what you wrote when you wrote it.<n>5. Choice D. Although books, like notes or diaries, can be accessed by family, this does not mean that everyone in the family would have access to it.<n>6. Choice E. The computer file could be password protected to prevent others from viewing it.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

It could be a classmate, roommate, spouse, etc.<n>3) Option A: workplace. Some schools have designated meet up spots where students leave with one another to go somewhere else. It's possible to meet up with a classmate of friend at your school. But it's not likely to be the first option for the majority of people.<n>4) Option B: bus station. If it's not a place you visit often, it's probably not convenient for you to leave for there to meet up with someone, especially if you're coming from work.<n>5) Option C: social atmosphere. It could be a cafe or bar, but it's more likely to be a restaurant. It could be an option, but if the person you're meeting is in the same restaurant, it's likely that he would go to a different table to avoid being recognized as being somewhere unusual and awkward.<n>6) Option D: neighbor's home. It depends on what's available or not available.<n>7) Option E: at school.<n>8) After considering all the options for this question, answer E is correct.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is a reason a person might have two computers?

Choices:  A: apartment B: pantry C: table D: living room E: shelf<n>Output:		1: The question is asking which place is usually storing dishes, but not books.<n><n>2: We then consider each of given options.<n><n>3: A: Apartments are living units that contains a large number of facilities such as living room, bedrooms, bathrooms etc. In an average apartment, we may not get to see a big and separate pantry that serves us with dishes, whereas we could see shelves in living rooms, bedrooms and kitchen and each of them could host books.<n><n>4: B: Pantry is not an apt place to store dishes. A pantry is usually attached to kitchen and serves us with food items such as bread, milk, pastas, rice, flours etc. Therefore, it is not the place where you usually store plates, cups, cutleries, glasses and other dishes.<n><n>5: C: Tables are used to place plates, cutleries, food items and books.<n><n>6: D: We could not consider a living room as a place where we store dishes. The living room is a place of relaxation where people do not keep any plates or cutleries or eat food items. Books are usually placed on shelves and not stored in living room.<n><n>7: E: Shelves in a house could be found in every room and they could not be said to store anything. A shelf could only store books.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is B: pantry.<n><n>### Your Program should be in Python3, and if you find a better way to explain things in comments and I will try to make changes <n>

However, we know that there is a court case and therefore option D can be eliminated since there is no such example given. It remains to be judged on which of the two is the correct one.<n>5- When looking at the options given we can see that there is one that clearly doesn't fit the bill, which is option B, since it says court case and there is no trial, but we can say option C fits. Therefore, we can say that the only option that doesn't match the feelings are A and C. After considering all the choices we can say that the option that doesn't fit are B and C and there by the best choice for the correct answer is either A or D which are options C and D.<n><n>Input: How many people could fit in a single elevator during the middle ages?

Petrol stations, also known as gas stations, are located near homes and businesses and are often located within or near a town or city.<n>5: Option C: a food court. This may not be an answer if the gas station is small and does not include any food or restaurants. However, if the gas station is large, there may be food courts within or nearby that could be considered an option. <n>5: Option D: a mechanic. We don't know the context of this question, but this option is unlikely to be correct if it is about a gas station.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

Choices:  A: pharmacy B: person C: drugstore D: bedroom E: mcdonalds<n>Output:		1)  The question is asking where someone can purchase a contraceptive product without a prescription.<n>2)  We then consider each of these options.<n>3)  Option A: pharmacy. Most pharmacies do sell contraceptive devices, but a prescription might be required upon purchase. Therefore, if someone can't access a prescription, they might not be able to purchase their contraceptive device at a pharmacy. Still, this may vary depending on their relationship with the pharmacist or other staff members.<n>4)  Option B: person. It's an interesting thought, but generally speaking, you cannot purchase contraceptive devices from a person in your bedroom without a prescription. This would violate many laws and regulations about personal healthcare.<n>5)  Option C: drugstore. Most drugstores do sell contraceptive products, but a prescription may be required upon purchase. So, if someone is unable to obtain a prescription for their contraceptive product, it is unlikely they could purchase it in a drugstore.<n>6)  Option D: bedroom.  It's true you could theoretically purchase a contraceptive in your bedroom without prescription, but in all likelihood, it would be an illegal transaction, so the person asking the question is attempting to make a joke.<n>7)  Option E: mcdonadns. Mcdonalds does not sell contraceptive devices. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be relevant to the question.

The question is about people looking at some things which are in a moving situation but are not moving.<n>  2. Option A: football stadium. If a stadium's surface area is covered in people, the total surface area is still moving and people in it are also moving. People are not actually moving (i.e. no foot or head movement).<n>  3. Option B: surface of earth. The earth is moving because the earth is always moving, and the surface of the earth is covered in mountains and valleys where movement occurs. So the earth is moving, but the surface of the earth and the people on it are not.<n>  4. Option C: car show. At a car show the cars are not moving, which means they are in a moving situation—their owners brought them to the car show. The people, however, are moving (to look at the automobiles).<n>  5. Option D: opera. The opera is considered a moving situation because people are sitting in seats moving in unison. They are not actually moving though.<n>  6. Option E: movie. A movie is a form of moving, of course, but the people in the audience and the actors on the screen are not moving.<n>so the answer is option A: football stadium<n><n>Input:Where is it that people are working on their vehicles, which they may not get? Choices:  a: grocery store b: repair C: rental D: library E: restaurant<n>Output: Where is it that people are trying to make their cars better but can't? Choices: 1. A: grocery store. At a grocery store, a person would be working on their car.<n>2. B: repair. Some people work in auto repair shops, but it could just as easily be someone fixing a car in their driveway or at the mechanic's shop.<n>3. C: rental. A person working to improve their vehicle may rent the vehicle so they can drive it.<n>4. D: library. It's not clear why a library would be considered a suitable place for this, but, say, a person renting a car would be working on their vehicle and not get a rental car.<n>5. E: restaurant. A person working on their vehicle at a restaurant may also not get a car.<n>Final Answer : A: groc

Choices:  A: amusement park B: urban area C: airport D: shopping malls E: train station<n>Output:		The first part of the question asks where you park in the parkin lot with shopping baggage.<n><n>The question then says - In what areas of the parking lot will you find shopping bags piling up most often?<n><n>Since the answer to the first part of the question can be any place and so, it doesn't tell us anything as far as the second part of the question is concerned.<n><n>Next, for the second part of the queestion -<n><n>Option A: Amusement Park - No shopping is done in an amusement park and hence, no cars are coming into that area because no shopping has been done.<n><n>Option B: Urban Area - People in urban areas use public transport and hence no cars will parked there. People from the suburbs will have to travel long so as to reach cities. Hence, they would drive their cars when they reach their homes after their tiresome day of work. When they come home, they will park their cars and not drive further. And thus, in an Urban Area, there will be no shopping bags piled up near the parking lots.<n><n>Option C: Airport - Airlines are there because of air travel. Hence, people will either travel to there or come back from there. However, most of them will reach the airport via air travel which will leave no room for shopping. The airport has security and hence even if someone intends to come shopping, their luggage will not pass through the security checks.<n><n>Option D: Shopping malls - Shopping malls are for shopping and hence there will be vehicles from nearby areas as well. These vehicles will have no intention of further transport. So, they can park their vehicles here and use public transport to reach the nearby areas. Hence, there will be no piling up of shopping bags.<n><n>Option E: Train Station - People travel by train to travel long distances and hence vehicles coming to that train station do not contain shopping bags. Also, people using that train station already have public transport tickets as they have already paid for it using their credit/debit cards or cash. The train station does not have any more space left within its premises to add more vehicles to it. Hence, people will park their vehicles at the adjacent parking lots.<n>

He tripped, indicating that it's possible he could've tripped again if he'd continued running.<n>3. It's not clear if "think" is a command, but if it is then the runner should think ahead to the potential that he could find himself tripping again on a loose shoe string.<n>4. Resting once he tripped would help prevent the issue of tripping on a loose string. It's also possible that he could've trips even if he hadn't been tired.<n>5. Increasing the length of time he runs wouldn't help solve the problem of tripping if he's wearing shoes that aren't tied properly.<n>6. He should take a moment to sit down before he falls over if he hasn't already.<n>7. He should probably take a moment to do up his shoe tie before he attempts to run away again, as the shoe might once more trip him up.<n><n>Input: What kind of animal is not really an animal and can be found in China, Korea and Japan?

Earning money refers to someone who is financially stable and makes enough money to buy gifts for people. Gift-giving is just one part of the person's generosity.<n>3. Having money refers to someone who has acquired a sufficient amount of money to be able to buy presents and therefore act generously. This is not necessary the case if the person is known to spend all his/her money on presents.<n>4: Gift buyer refers to someone whose spending habits consist of buying gifts. In most cases, gift-buyers may not have sufficient income to be generous and may be known for buying presents, but not for being generous.<n>5. Buying presents often would simply mean that you are an avid present buyer, but this should not be considered as a form of generosity.<n><n>6: Therefore, option B: generous is the correct answer<n><n>Input: Which is faster to use to create an online survey? Choices: 1) Online website builder 2) Survey site 3) Web site 4) Survey builder 5) Website builder<n>Output: 1) Survey site is the correct answer. It's faster to use to create online surveys.2) Web site: The first sentence of the question says that the two given options can be used together or separately. That is, while other given options can be used independently in their own way, Web site can't be used on its own.<n>3) Web site: Web site refers to any website that is created and hosted through a web server. While it can be made to work together with a survey and create a survey website, it can't be used separately in its own way.<n>4) Survey builder: The other two options, 'Online website builder' and 'Website builder’ are online tools for making websites and can be used to do both website design and survey designs. However, their use is contingent on the availability of a web server for hosting the created websites and surveys and that is why they can be used together for creating survey-based websites but cannot be used apart without a web server.<n>5) Survey site

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

Choices: 1: A: turn red 2: B: get angry 3: C: go to an easy-going person 4: D: turn red and angry 5: E: go to a hard-headed one<n>Output: We can interpret the sentence as a query to understand what hard-headed people do.<n>1: We can eliminate option A as turning red may happen to people with different personalities. So answer choice A is not possible.<n>2: we can eliminate option B as getting angry may happen to people with various personalities. So answer B, getting angry, is not possible.<n>3: We can eliminate option D as turning red and angry may happen to people of diverse personalities. Answer choice D is not possible.<n>4: The answer choice is C, going to an easy-going one. This can happen to people with diverse personalities.<n>So, option C is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: A: What is your father's favorite instrument? B: he can play guitar and piano.

The reason for his statement is that his father's name is Guitar Smith and it's likely that he named himself after his favorite instrument.<n>I'll also assume that option C - guitar is a stringed instruments, is incorrect as A guitar has a body consisting of many individual pieces and these pieces are made by gluing thin wood, with different shapes, over a solid block of wood (the "body") as they glue these together they do it in such as way that the strings run under them, not over them

Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Mark wanted to know the truth, because he didn't want to continue existing in what? Choices:  A: understand B: were there C: ignorance D: in-between E: ignorant<n>Output:		The question wants what the answer is.  It is not asking how to make truth understandable; understandable is not a noun. The sentence is asking us to think about how truth could lead to us not wanting to continue existing. We are not asked to give more than two words - we can't go beyond "know" without "tell", which is not a requirement and is not a complete word.  The key to this question, therefore, is to look for all the possibilities that lead a person to not want to continue existing on Earth, or at least to not want to tell anyone who they are and what they know. <n><n>1. The first key idea is "understanding".  A person who fully understands something will understand exactly what it is and what it does. If you don't want to tell someone who you are and what you know, you would tell it to no one. But Mark doesn't want to continue to exist on Earth - this means that he doesn't want to remain on Earth at all or he wants not to be alive; he wants to give up his life on Earth. Knowledge has an effect on people who have it. If you know what something is and you don't tell someone, the person may be scared or unsure what it is and try to guess what it is.<n>2.The second key idea is "ignorance". If you don't understand something, you probably wouldn't try to tell it to anyone; and you wouldn't tell anyone at all who Mark is or what he knows.<n><n>3. The third key idea is "in-between". The key to this is "in-between", as in "between". In other words, all of these four are between "understandable" and "understanding" or "ignorance" and "knowledge". By this logic, the answer would also be the other three and it is not given by option B.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n><n>Input: How are mosses and plants related? Choices: 1.

Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		1  The question is asking where someone is not happy to take their own car.<n>2. We consider each of the options to see which are likely candidates for this situation.<n>3. Option B: taking a car down a river. We determine that this option cannot be the correct answer because to take a car down a river takes more than one person and usually multiple vehicles.<n>4. Option C: taking a car to a repair shop. This is the option we're looking for. In this scenario, a person is not generally happy to take their car to a shop for repairs.<n>5. Option D: taking a car to someone's garage or parking lot. This can be another possibility if a person doesn't know how to fix their car. In this case, they may want to take it to a repair shop or a mechanic.<n>6. Option E: taking a car to the neighbor's house. This is a good answer as long as the neighbor knows how to fix a car or can help with repairs in some way. We determine that this is the correct answer. If the neighbor doesn't know much about cars, the person is not likely to be happy.<n>7. With this information, the correct answer is E: neighbor's garage or house.

If we want to limit the potential answers to only "positive effects", the question would be more appropriately phrased as follows:<n>3. "Remembering past success is likely to have what effect?"<n><n>4. "Remembering" would probably prompt many "nagging thoughts", or "what-if" scenarios. This, in turn, often leads to crying, inspiring, etc. in many people.<n>5. However, the question is phrased rather broadly and has not specifically limited us to only the examples listed above.<n>6. Thus, the answer D: trauma could be correct, but is not definitively so as the question is worded. <n>7. Similarly, remembering past success may sometimes have negative effects such as creating fear, insecurities, etc.

If the sentence is matching with the meaning of the letter, it will be the correct answer.<n>3) Option A: fatigue: In this context, fatigue will be the correct answer, since exercising can only be fatiguing.<n>4) Option B: relax: In this sentence, relaxation does not seem to be a suitable option, because in doing exercises our muscles contract and the blood flow in the body is increased. This can make us more alert and active.<n>5) Option C: tiredness: The meaning of the word tiredness is “feeling sleepy”, and tiredness is not a suitable option among all the options given.<n>6) Option D: muscle weak: It can be an outcome after exercise, as an excessive stretching can make the muscles to weak, but in this context, it can be the incorrect answer.<n>7) Option E: lose weight: This can be possible but the sentence does not specifically mention that it will be exercised for losing weight. Loss of body weight can also be a consequence of excessive exercising, so it is an optional answer.<n>8) The final answer to be determined is A: fatigue because fatigue will be the only possibility that can explain the sentence.<n>

Choices:  [A] A breeze blows at a constant 10 meters per second B[B] A breeze passes over the paper air plane C[C] The density of the air is less than that at sea level D The temperature of the atmosphere D E[E] All of the choices are necessary C<n>Output: 1 The answer is A because the plane was releasing at a constant speed, thus the wind speed and direction had to keep the plane at the same speed and direction as the plane were released. 2.) The answer is A because at the same time a breeze has to be blowing, the density of the air has to be less than that at sea 3) The answer is A since it is only paper planes that could be released
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Ice fishing can be done surprisingly far out most winters on what greatest of the Michigan's greats?

After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If there is a stale smell in the air coming from the kitchen, what should one check for the source of the smell? Choices:  A: bathroom B: house C: cupboard D: space shuttle E: surface of earth<n>Output:		1) If there is a stale odor in the air coming from a kitchen, you should check for the source of that odor.<n>2) Options B, C and D cannot be the final answer because all of these are part of the kitchen.<n>3) Option E is not the source of smell because it's a surface of the Earth where the smell is coming from.<n>So the final option answer is A: bathroom<n><n>Input:Where could you find a plumbing that is not made to supply water? Choices: 1: A: oil well 2: B: house 3: C: bathroom 4: D: water fountain 5: E: wall<n>Output: 1: A is not used for plumbing 2: B is not not used for plumbling 3: C is a bathroom 4:D is water fountain <n>5: E is a wall.<n>So the final response is E:wall<n>Input:What would the question "Did you enjoy that" refer to here? Choices: <n>1: A: a musical performance<n>2: B: a bathroom<n>3: C: oil refineries <n>4: D: plumbing <n>5: E: a cookery show<n>Output: 1a. It is obvious to a person who reads the question that "that" would refer to a musical performance. The question in bold is obviously about a musical performance as is confirmed by the rest of the question.<n>2a. It is impossible to determine from the question about a bathroom.<n>3a. It is also impossible to determine from the given question to whether plumbing is being referred to.<n>4a. It is obvious that this answer cannot be the final response as it would contradict the meaning of the first question ("Did you enjoy that?").<n>5a. The statement "It means a show where cooks cook" points to a cookery show. But, a cookery show is a show, so it is not immediately clear whether "that" refers to a cookery show or to plumbing.<n>However, Option 5 is not the final response because a cookery show would be more about watching others cook, which is different from the original question.<n>So the final outcome is B: bathroom

Choices:  A: celebrate B: have party C: hear crowd go mad D: create success E: reproduce<n>Output:		1: Considering the question "What would be considered a'success' when attempting procreation?"<n>2: The correct answer to this question is probably going to depend a lot on the definition of success, as well as on whether procreation is successful or not.<n>3. Option "celebrate" would be considered successful if the procreation happened.<n>4. Option "have a party" is a questionable "success", since it is not necessary for the procreation to occur for a party to be held, in which case this choice would not necessarily be viewed as successful.<n>5. Option "hear crowd go mad" is similar to option "have a party" in that it does not directly reference whether or not procreation occurred, making this choice potentially unsuccessful if procreation did not occur.<n>6. Option "create success" would probably only be considered a "success" if procreation occurred; this option does not necessarily imply that procreation was successful but rather that the act was performed successfully.<n>7. Option "reproduce" is the final choice which implies that the goal of successful procreation was met. This choice is thus the correct answer to the question.<n><n>Input Where did the phrase "that's where the rubber meets the road" originate from and how does it relate to the actual rubber and the road?

This could be used to eliminate (C): Record Store as the answer.<n>10: In the end, the only option that allows you to find what you are looking for is (B): Record Albums, as it is the only location where you could find it in a record album to soundtrack an album cover/advertisement.<n>

Choices:  A: eat grass B: play C: kept in stables D: dominated E: drink coffee<n>Output:		2.  It's easy to see that horses do eat grass.<n>3.  But what about the other choices?<n>4.  There might be one or more options that have to do with energy—and in fact, there is a chance some of these options have to do with energy.  But because of the context of the question, which is about horses, they might not.<n>5.  Option A: eat grass. As the question states, horses eat grass and drink water.<n>6.  Option B: play. Play is an interesting option because in other questions, play might be thought to bring energy back to a person. In this question, though, there are no signs that play could bring energy, let alone food.<n>7.  Option C: kept in stabled. Horses are indeed kept in stables with hay and sometimes water.  And when their food is put in, horses also do eat. But stabled has not been mentioned as a part of the question. Also, although it's not specified, the "keeping" might pertain to the animal being given energy, not the way an animal's energy is stored. This is an option to consider but not necessarily the correct one<n>8.  Option D: dominated. Dominating is an interesting option, as the other answers seem to pertain to physical activity, like playing and eating.  If there is a possible "dominance contest" between horses, the question doesn't specify this, either. This might be a viable option, but there is no certainty that dominated would bring energy to the horse.<n>9.  Option E: drink coffee. There is actually a chance this could be a legit option.<n>If a horse is on their own in a field, there is a chance that a horse owner would want the horse to drink a small amount of coffee to wake them up—though of course, this is far from a common practice.<n>10. But overall, this option is considered a little out there.<n>11. As we saw, the question didn't mention energy or food being stored or transported or kept in stables, which in some cases might mean that horses had to drink coffee to get energy. Since the horses are mentioned to eat grass and to drink water, horse owner might want to add the coffee to the routine so to "wake the horse up", but again this is out there. <n>

The question is asking how the "this person" would like to spend the extra time they have when their partner leaves for work. The most common answers the question could ask would have to do with a person's lifestyle habits.<n>2. Option A: more rice. This option is likely a choice for someone who has a relatively boring lifestyle due to their job. They would like to increase the amount of stimulation they get and having something new each day would help contribute to that.<n>3. Option B: own house. This option is similar to option A in that it involves increasing stimulation, but the addition brings about an active lifestyle that can be a way to alleviate stress.<n>4. Option C: warm coat. Option C is a more passive lifestyle choice. A person who chooses this option is much less likely to be a hard worker.<n>5. Option D: light up.

Working out is a possible answer if the runner was working out and not running for exercise or pleasure. However, running is not the same as working out.<n>4. Option C. It’s perfectly reasonable for someone to say they were “tired” after a run, even though it sounds contradictory at first. Perhaps this person had a rough day at work and wasn’t able to go for their regular run, resulting in a tired feeling afterward.<n>5. Option D.

Option A: maps: Maps are not a place for a bus station, but can be used for directions if you are unsure how to go to a bus station.<n>7. Option B: street: Street in general may or may not be a convenient place for a local bus station. It depends on where on the street the station is located and whether it makes sense to go there.<n>8. Option C: catch bus: This makes sense when thinking of public transportation. <n>9. Option D: city centre: If you are asking about a city, a city center is the place you go to in order to get around the city. If you are asking about some other area, such as your neighbourhood, it would depend on whatever your "city centre" is. <n>10. Option E: school: Schools serve a number of purposes. If you are referring to a school as a place for public transportation, it would be a place where students come and go each day and may use public transportation.  If the school you are referring to is not a public school, it may not make sense as a place for a bus stop or bus station, at least not if it is not located near a main road or public hub. <n>11. Once we have considered all the options for each option, we can make a decision on what the answer would be.<n><n>12.

Option A: car. A car is a transport vehicle that is propelled by an engine powered by gasoline or diesel fuel. Car steering is commonly handled by hand-operated steering wheels, and gas pedals are used to control the throttle. Therefore, these factors eliminate all possible answers but Option B.<n>3. Option B: fuel system. A fuel system consists mostly of the gas tank and the fuel lines that power your car's engine. Option C: accelerate: A car accelerates by increasing the speed of its engine, and the foot pedal for throttle control in a vehicle would be called the accelerator and would be controlled with the foot. Therefore, all other options are eliminated, leaving Option D.<n>4. Option D: boat. A boat's main function is to be propelled on water by a small motor or propeller (the propulsion system) that is controlled by the throttle of a gasoline engine.

Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

Choices:  A: demonstration B: garage C: building D: barn E: synagogue<n>Output:		1.) The question asks about giving a good hands-on when doing work.<n><n>2. The given choices:<n>3.  Option A: demonstration. In our daily life, we often show work using demo.<n>For example, in the construction industry, an architect may demo the entire project from beginning to end, so that any onlooker can see where all the problems might occur beforehand and how they will be fixed before starting to develop a project. The demo would serve as a preview of how the ultimate project would look after completion.<n>4.  Option B: garage. The garage is actually a place where you store the tools and supplies that you need for your work. Therefore, the garage may not necessarily be used as a hands-on tool for your work in the way of a demo.<n>The garage may only provide storage for your tools and supplies, and it may not be a good idea to use these tools for a demo because the garage may not have sufficient space to accommodate an audience and the tools may not be in good condition after being used for so long. Therefore, option B, garage, is not the correct answer.<n>5.  Option C: building. Option C, building, is the correct answer. In a building, you can show your work using demo. Besides, there is enough room and you can show to your clients. The demo in a building can last for a long time. So, if you decide to show your work, you can use an office to present the demo.<n>6. Option A: barn. In an agricultural setting, a barn is where farm animals are housed. It is not appropriate to demonstrate work in a barn because your work may not be related to agriculture. So, option B is better than option D when you consider the context of the question.<n>7. Option D: synagogue. Synagogue is a place of worship in Judaism. It is not a suitable place to show your work because it is used for religious purposes and there is no need for demonstrations.<n>8. After taking everything into consideration, one would conclude that option C, building, is a suitable place to give a good demonstration of how anything is done as opposed to the other options. Hence, option C is the correct answer to the question.<n><n>Input : What can you see in the image above? Choices: 1. A: a house

The question is requesting a response to the scenario where all fish in a pond would lose their memory.<n>2. The first sentence of answer A, "If all the fish in a [pond] were to lose their memory, the pond would [become crowded] …", indicates that if all fish have memory, then the pond would be less likely to become crowded. This is in part due to the behavior of fish: as soon as fish lose their memory, they would start jumping out of the pond, making it become less crowded. This option is acceptable, but too specific.<n>3. Option B. "crowded," which is an acceptable response to option A, is also an acceptable response to any of the other 4 options. An additional response to this choice would be "overcrowded."<n>4. Option C: "depressed," "bored," etc. are all acceptable answers to choice A.

Choices:  A: under rocks B: manhattan C: toenails D: grocery store E: fallen tree<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where a fungus cannot grow if it is under sunlight. Funguses cannot grow in the sunlight, so the first option is correct A.<n>2. Option B, Manhattan, means that the fungus cannot grow as there has been no sunlight since the ice age. It's like if someone said "where will a tree grow if it's covered by snow?" the answer is that it will not be able to grow unless it has enough sunlight to feed on. Therefore option B, Manhattan, isn't an option<n>3. Option C, toe nails, is a bit of a stretch. While nails do get wet, they're typically not moist, nor do funguses typically like moist environments to grow in. Toe nails may not be a good place to look for a fungus.<n>4. Option D, Grocery store, is a bit of an ambiguous question. Sure, you might think it means a grocery store since there tends to be more sunlight in the aisles. However, grocery stores tend to have very clean, dry air in it making it inhospitable for fungus growth. Even if there is sunlight, there is likely also the chance for cross contamination since most grocery stores do not clean the floors with disinfectant. Option 4 is therefore incorrect.<n>5. Option E, a fallen tree, is more correct in that the fallen tree has no sunlight. This is more akin to what we would mean if someone said "where would a tree grow best?" The fallen tree is an adequate place for fungus growth, but you could get the mold elsewhere. Option E is therefore the correct answer.<n>##### Conclusion:<n><n><n>### Discussion points:<n>The question does not specify anything about the area being questioned, but when looking at the answers they have a "New York" vibe to them, which implies that the question may be referencing a larger area than just a fungus under a rock, for example.<n>Also note, answer E is almost correct in that it is indeed a fallen tree, but if it'd been "growing" instead of "growing", the answer would have sufficed.<n><n>### Additional Instructions:<n>Answer the question given below:<n>How did the mugger

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If someone is aloof and self-important, what is their experience when meeting people?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

The chances of finding fire extinguish in a house are low.<n><n>5) The fourth choice is house. In the house, there are fewer chances of finding the extinguisher as the number of rooms is much lesser than a hospital.<n><n>6) The last choice is doll house. Given the fact that doll house is a house of miniature size, it is natural to not find an extinguisher in it.<n><n>7) Since, all the options except the garage have a good chance of having a fire and we may find the extinguisher in the garage, we can conclude that the correct answer is "garage".<n>  <n>  <n>Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question: Where would you not find the most useful plumbing if you had a <n>    <n>    severe thirst?

In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show.

After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:They checked the weather one more time during the flight, they were on their way to paradise and wanted it to what? Choices:  A: look beautiful B: be happy C: change quickly D: occur here E: surprise us<n>Output:		 After considering all the options and the context of the question, the correct answer is the only one that makes sense from the options and the paragraph as following and can be inferred by the question: The weather needs to change. The sentence "they were on their way to Paradise and wanted it to change quickly" clearly suggests that they want to go to a place where the weather is different and they would not like the weather there to be the same as where they're going from.<n><n>Input: She is an excellent listener, she will sit in the park and listen to the what?  Choices: A: birds B: weather C: winds D: rain E: stories<n>Output:  The park is not the most reasonable place for someone to sit and listen to the weather outside. The weather changes all the time, and it's difficult to know what's happening outside unless you have clear line-of-sight (or technology that can predict the weather accurately). So, the answer has to be "birds" because they don't usually fly around in the park unless there is some sort of danger or distraction that makes it difficult for people to hear them.<n><n>Input:  What will you use for food to go to Hawaii? Choices: A: the island B: a beach C: their appetite D: my friends in the air, E: the plane<n>Output:  By "food" they don't mean what to eat, but how to get a meal on a plane. And by using "the island" or "beach", the travel agents are saying that they will likely have meals on their journey or that it won't be hard to find food/drinks because there will be other people nearby. But neither "the island" nor "the beach" make sense because even if they were near each other (which isn't always the case), they'd still be far away from most areas with people in them to eat/drink with them/get their own food/drinks etc. It also can't be used here because it wouldn't be reasonable to assume that there'll be food readily available if they want it or don't want it. But "my friends in the air" doesn't always include them if they want food on their trip, but it does include them if they don't want to eat/drink as much and are willing to share

Therefore, only houses built between these time periods can be considered Victorian.<n>Option C: mentions that this house must be from the victorian or before eras. This means that if a house is Victorian of a more, it would fall in the era covered by option B.  Option D: a house refers to a structure that is built with an intention to be resided, as in a home. Since a home is a place of living, and houses can have attics filled with historical items, it can be said that this option is incorrect.  Option E: mentions that the items should be material.

In context, the question is asking how someone who loves their television feels about their remote.<n>3.  Option A" attached" does not fit well because although we can assume the person loves their television, they probably aren't attached to their remote in the same way.<n>It is unlikely that the person would think that their remote is an integral part of their life or think of it as an extension of themselves. <n>4. Option B" nostalgic or companionable is more suitable because those words are more likely to reflect how someone might feel about their remote.<n>These emotions can be very similar to how someone might feel about a pet or close friend. <n>4. In these two options,  B: nostalgic is the best fit because it indicates a feeling of both nostalgia and compassion.<n>5, Option D: "likely" is a more appropriate choice than  Option E: close because it describes a feeling of empathy or identification with the remote device, rather than a closer, more intimate bond.<n>6.

Choices:  A: unimportant B: insignificant C: stellar D: somewhat E: helpless<n>Output:		1: The camper looked up at night sky, it left feeling:  If you look at it carefully, the question is asking how the camper felt, not the feeling of the night sky.<n>2. Looking up at the night sky makes the camper feel the following emotions:<n>3. Option A - “Unimportant”: The camper might feel unimportant because looking up at the vast night gives no clue as to him.<n>4. Option “B” - “Insignificant”: The camper feels insignificant because he thinks no one cares about him. This is because of his lack of knowledge of the universe or his lack of importance in the scheme.<n>5. Option “C” - “Stellar”: Option A - “Stellar"<n>7. The camper feels somewhat significant when he looks up at the night sky because he is amazed by the incredible beauty, which means there are some who care about him<n>8.

Choices:  The question doesn't specify why the teacher screamed at the end of the question<n>Output: 1 The reasons why the teacher screams at the end of the quarter.<n>2. When the teacher turns 21 the first time, he probably sees it as the end of an important year in his life because he is now old enough to legally enjoy alcohol. <n>3. Therefore, the teacher may want to celebrate his accomplishments and he may scream to mark that special moment, as it is a significant milestone in his life.<n>4. It is likely that the teacher turned 21 during the first time, causing the scream at the end in question.<n>5. Option A: “Because he was a screaming teacher” should not be the correct option since we do not know why the teacher screaming screamed
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

Choices:  A: boredom B: patience C: time D: teachers E: inspiration<n>Output:		1 Boredom: this option is incorrect as it is difficult for children to listen while bored.<n>2 Patience: this option is incorrect because this is not an attribute required to instruct children at school, rather the children will be more interested in what is being taught and will tend to be patient during the training.<n>3 Time: this option is incorrect since this is an attribute required to instruct teachers and for their students, but not necessarily what is required to instruct children at a school. Therefore, this option is incorrect.<n>4 Teachers: this option is incorrect, since teachers need to be qualified to have the necessary knowledge to teach and this is a different attribute from what is required to instruct a child at a school.<n>5 Inspiration: this option would be required to keep the students motivated, but not to properly instruct them.<n>So the final incorrect answer would be C: time, while the final correct answer would be E: inspiration.<n><n>#####################################################################<n>

Choices:  A: fresh smell B: good credit C: smooth skin D: fresh produce E: headache<n>Output:		1 A smell has nothing to do with the person being a "person" but with what lotion is being put on.<n>2 C is inaccurate, as having good credit doesn't necessarily give you smooth skin, and you can still get smooth skin without your credit being good. Similarly, if you have poor credit, you still may have smooth skin.<n>3 D is wrong because produce is not smooth to begin with.<n>4 E is wrong because nobody wants a headache, but lotion will usually not cause a headache, unless it contains allergens or something.<n>5 After considering all the options we can find that all the other options are relevant, but lotion can be put on anyone, no matter what their credit is like. It does not need to be fresh produce. A: fresh produce seems the most reasonable and accurate, so that should be the final answer.<n><n>Input:What would you eat to have the most variety? Choices:  a. Cereal b. Sandwich c. Muffin d. Cookie e. Salad f. Pasta<n>Output: 1 <n>2 	Cereal has many kinds of it, and it is always something that we can eat.<n>3 	Sandwiches have many kinds of sandwiches, so sandwich is not going to be the best way to have the most variety<n>4 	A muffin is not necessarily something to eat that we see everyday, so muffin's answer would not have the highest variety.<n>5 	Cookies can get repetitious, so would not have the best variety.<n>6 	Salads are something that can differ a lot everytime you eat one, so pasta is better than salad.<n>7 	We can eat pizzas as many times as we want to have more variety, so this is the best choice.<n>8 	The above logic gives us that the best answer is pizza, and pizza has the most variety.<n><n>Input: If a person was selling a toothpaste, what might be the most likely reason that they were standing in a crowded street?

The mom has a loose dictionary, to put the dictionary at a shelf, classroom, or desk is difficult, because these places will not be easily reached during her tidying activities.<n>3. But she probably can put the dictionary on a table or in a library, since these places are easy to reach during her tidying. <n>4. There is an alternative way of answering the question, we can imagine that after putting the dictionary, Mom would go to each table and library, find the dictionary, and put in at the table or library. <n>5. Therefore, the answer should be either a library or desk, where she can easily reach to put the dictionary.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: jar B: stick to fingers C: beehive D: stick to fingers E: farmer's market<n>Output:		1."stick to fingers" or "fingers" should be the correct answer.<n>2.This prompt might be asking you to buy honey directly from the bees, and not from a jar or a hive.<n>3.Sticking with "fingers" would make sense, because we would want to "stick on it" to get the benefits of honey and not just take it and throw it away.<n>4.However, some might argue that we could also "stick to fingers" and the result would be the same. <n>5.Also, to be on the safe side, "fingers" is technically more specific than "sticks to fingers". <n>So the answer is "finger".<n><n>Input:Where can one have breakfast in New York City? Choices: A: Coffee shop B: Sandwich shop C: Brunch spot D: Cafe E: Bakeries<n>Output: 1:"Cafe" is the only choice that includes "coffee", "sandwich", "brunch", or "bakeries". Therefore, we can conclude that option A is the best.<n>2.Breakfast can be had at a coffee shop, a cafe, a bakery, a sandwich shop, or a brunch spot.<n>3.Option A: coffee shop. Most people would agree that coffee is a very popular breakfast choice.<n>4.Option B: sandwich shop. This option seems to be a lot less straightforward in this question.<n>5.Option C: brunch spot. Brunch is usually a leisure event consisting of mainly eggs and other light meals. It usually starts after 12 pm, so it's not the same as breakfast.<n>6.Option D: cafe. Options D, E, or A, all have the same amount of relevance to breakfast options. Therefore, choosing option D would be most logical.<n>7.Option E: bakery. This option is mainly about the different types of baked goods you can find, which doesn't really have any bearing on if it's breakfastable or not.<n>So the final choice is option A: Coffee Shop<n><n>Input: You are planning on traveling to a city where you don’t know anyone, but don’t like to stay in hotels, what is a good solution?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Jimmy wanted a beer but his wife was an alcoholic on probation.  Where might he go? Choices:  A: neighbor's house B: bridge C: home D: homeless shelter E: prison<n>Output:		<n>1. The question asks Jimmy where he would go to find a beer.<n>2. Option A: neighbour's house. In most cases, the answer could be found by considering the situation and the available options, such as a bar or grocery store.<n>3. Option B: bridge. It doesn't clearly specify the type of bridge, but in most cases, bridges do not serve and are not known for alcohol.<n>4. Option C: home. Since the answer is referring to alcohol and not alcoholic beverages, the answer here can be none of those.<n>5. Option D: homeless shelter. Homeless shelters are sometimes referred to as "halfway houses", where people often receive food, drinks, social services, transportation, counseling, and sometimes even shelter.<n>6. Option E: prison. Since it states "on probation", this would not be a correct answer. Prisons often do not serve alcohol.<n>Output:<n>1 This is the question where our algorithm will be able to answer the question.<n>2 The question poses a scenario in which Jimmy is in a position where he cannot get what he wants.<n>3 The answer lies in locating a situation or situation in which alcohol is either available or permitted.<n>Output:<n>4 Given the above context and information, it is clear that the answer to the question lies in some kind of "halfway house", a place that provides a place to live and help for those who are homeless and addicted.<n>

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

Choices:  A: street B: soccer field C: soccer game D: central park E: pool table<n>Output:		1:The question is asking where kids play with a "concrete" ball.<n>2. Option A: street. Kids may play with concrete balls on the street, but it does not make sense to refer to the concrete ball as concrete. This is because concrete is a material typically used to build pavements or roads.<n>3. Option B: soccer field. Kids may play soccer games with concrete balls on the field, but it does not seem like those balls would be made of concrete.<n>4. Option C: soccer game. Kids may play "soccer games" with concrete balls, but it doesn't seem appropriate to refer to the ball as "concrete".<n>5. Option D: central park. Kids may play in a "central park" with concrete balls, so it makes sense to refer to those balls as concrete.<n>6. Option E: pool table. Kids may play on a "pool table" with concrete balls, which makes it appropriate to refer to those balls in this way.<n><n>So the answer is D: Central park<n><n>Input:What do you need when you feel thirsty for water? Choices: 1:a bottle B: a drink of water 2.water C: a pitcher of water D: a cooler bag of water E: a bucket of water<n>Output: 1 :The question is asking what you need when you feel "thirsty" for " water".<n><n>2. Option A & B : You can be thirsty for water, but not require a bottle or a drink to quench your thirst. Having a drink of water does also not require a bottle to hold it or being drinkable, it could also just be regular water that isn't suitable for drinking. A bucket of water does not specify what type of bucket it is, and could be any type, including not be filled with water at all. It is therefore unlikely that all of these answers would adequately address the thirsty for water scenario.<n><n>3. Option C A pitcher is "A pitcher of water" implies that it's filled to the brim with water, so it would make sense to fill up a jug of water from the pitcher but fill a bottle or a glass with water. Also, a pitcher may be made out metal or wood which are not suitable to drink from. A pitcher

To answer this question, we first consider each of the given choices.<n>3. Option B: good health. Although there may be many people with brown skin, we are looking for a characteristic that all these people may have something in common in, and good health is not an appropriate answer as not all people with brown skin have good health.<n>4. Option C: own family. This is an incorrect answer because the question is asking for a characteristic that a person with brown skin may have something in common with others. Furthermore, a person's family members typically have a different appearance. Only some people with brown skin may share brown skin with their family members.<n>5. Option D: friends. This is a correct answer because we are looking for a shared characteristic that a person with a brown skin may have something common with others. We know that friends may have lots of shared characteristics.<n>6. Option E: people. Another correct answer is option E: people. We know that it may be difficult to differentiate the shared characteristic between people that do not know each other but if it was easy, then option C, own family, would be a valid choice. Option E: people is a correct answer because the shared characteristic is simply the color of the skin, which is not a unique characteristic but still would be found in lots of people regardless of other specific traits.<n>So the final answers are D: friends and E: people<n><n>Input:A thunderstorm causes what?

Closet could help in finding a shopping bag to carry a large amount of groceries but most closet do not have large enough shopping bags for groceries.<n>5. Option D: mart. A mart would have a lot of shopping bags, but these would not be suitable for packing grocer<n>6. Option E: hardware store. A hardware store would not have shopping bags, so the option is incorrect.<n>7.

This action may be necessary for getting nutrients from a host for its own survival, but it does not contribute significantly to locomotion.<n>5) Option C: stay. Fleas remain relatively stationary on a host, which means they do not move around much.<n>6) Option D: lay eggs. This is not relevant to whether or not fleas can move around, but it does contribute to the survival of the species.<n>7) Option E: jump. This is the most specific answer, as it describes the action of jumping when a flea is in motion.<n>8) After analyzing all of the given options, it is clear why "jump" is the correct answer, as jumping is the action that most clearly and directly contributes to a flea's ability to move around.<n>So the final choice is:  jump<n><n>Input:When could you have been born in the same year as your teacher?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:John's RV needs electricity so that he can cook lunch.

This would include places such as a home or office. (e.g., a company would be allowed to use their water supply to cook lunch at the office)

Choices: A: He never wants to drink it again B: He thinks he dislikes it C: He believes everyone should like it D: He wishes you liked it better E: This is not true of him<n>Output: 1 The question here is asking what you should believe about the man who says "This is not my cups of tea".<n>2 Then, we consider each of the given choices.<n>3. Option  A: He never wants the drink again. As a matter of fact, there is no one man that can say, "This is not his cup of tea". If the man wishes to say that he never wants this drink again, he simply says that he will not drink it again. If we consider the fact the man just said the quote, option A doesn't make any sense.<n>4. Option  B: He thinks he will dislike this drink. This option makes sense because the man may dislike this drink and he wants to let everyone know of that dislike. The man can also believe that everyone should like it. He makes the choice not to drink this tea if he never likes it.<n>5. Option  C: He believes that everyone should like it If the man would truly believe that everyone should like a cup of tea, he is not going to say "This is not my  cup of tea."<n>6 Finally, option D: He wishes you like the cup of tea better. The man may like the cup of tea himself and wish everyone else would like it. However, if he doesn't actually like it, he should not say so.<n>7. Therefore, the only option that makes sense is option C as the correct choice.<n>

This is not possible. If someone falls from a mountain, the force of gravity will pull them back toward the earth's surface. They will not be going upwards or sideways.<n>4) Option B: **act dead**. This is also not possible as they are already dead if they have fallen from the mountain.<n>5)  Option C: **die**. This is also true. If someone falls from the mountain, they will die.<n>6)  Option D: **rush**. This is also a possibility. When someone falls from a mountain and if their speed is sufficiently high and force of gravity is balanced out, they may actually start to pick up speed. This is called terminal velocity.<n>7)  Option E: **explode**. This cannot happen.<n>So, the final answer is D: rush<n><n>

Choices:  A: georgia B: the south pole C: kitchen cupboard D: italian restaurant E: boil eggs<n>Output:		The question is asking where was a saucepan kept that was used only for marinera. The given options are:<n>Option A: georgia. Since marinera is an Italian dish, it is unlikely that a saucepan used exclusively for making it would be kept in Georgia<n>Option B: the south pole. It is not specified that the saucepan is kept in the south pole. It could be kept in other locations around the world where marinara is not cooked, such as Antarctica, where it is too cold to cook food<n>Option C: kitchen cupboard. Kitchen cupboard could contain any number of saucepans, not just the one used for making marinera. Therefore, the answer for this option cannot be definitively "kitchen cupboard"<n><n>Option D: italian restaurant. An italian restaurant would likely have multiple saucepans used for making different dishes, such as pasta and pizza, that do not contain marinara<n>Option E: boil eggs. The saucepan question may appear to be asking about the location of the saucepan itself, rather than the location of a specific action to be taken. Therefore, the final conclusion on the question is that the saucepan used exclusivley for marinara would not be kept in the south pole or boiling water.

Choices:  A: original B: old C: coke clear D: former E: familiar<n>Output:		1: When a product is discontinued, it usually means that the original formula has been changed or stopped production altogether. So, it will either use the original formula, which hasn't changed since its introduction, or will no longer be available at all (i.e., they will not use any formula).<n>2: When we look at each of the given options, it seems that only option E, familiar, can be used as the new "formula" of coke. This is because "Coke Clear" refers to a clear carbonated drink that was popular in the 1980s as well as the 1990s.<n>So the final 0:The original formula has not changed, so it will continue to be used.<n><n>Input:Is there anything more frustrating than getting your 12th straight '1,2,3,4' puzzle?

The term "dicks sporting goods" can refer to the store, the products found in it, or the equipment or clothing worn by players during sporting events.

Option "C": Mall is a large commercial building that houses a variety of shops and often includes a food court. In many malls, stores like sporting goods stores can be found on the lower level. The mall is most likely not the appropriate location mentioned in the question because the emphasis is on location, not retail space.<n>6. Option "D": Sears is a department store that sells a wide variety of merchandise, including clothing, appliances, electronics, and sporting goods items. It's unlikely that sporting equipment would be required at a sears, but it is technically a possibility.<n>7.

Choices:  A: bathroom B: closet C: school D: room E: church<n>Output:		1."Weren't known for" suggests that something is unusual or different about the college kids, but the only thing specified is that they didn't like decorating their homes. Therefore, the question is not asking about any unusual or unexpected decor decisions, but rather about what kind of furniture they did use.<n>2. Option A: bathroom. A "bathroom" is definitely not a place for a folding chair.<n>3. Option B: closet. A folding chair is not expected to be placed inside a closet. The closet may be used to store the chair, but the chair is not expected to fit inside one.<n>4. Option C: school. A folding chair may be used for studying in a school setting, but this is not expected to be an everyday place for it.<n>5. Option D: room. In a private residence, a folding chair is typically used for temporary sitting such as during a party guest or utility worker visit. It is not used on a regular basis.<n>6. Option E: church. In a church or temple, a folding chair may be placed in front of the altar, but it is not expected to be a main part of the furniture.<n>7. After considering all the other options, it is clear from the context that the college kids did not use a folding chair as their main furniture piece, so the final answer is B: closet.<n>So the final choice is 1. Option A: What type of furniture?<n><n>Input:  What word is always followed by the suffix -tion? Choices:  B: action C: attraction D: location E: occupation<n>Output: 1: Suffix "-tion" means that an action happened at some time. Therefore a "location" is never followed by suffix "-tion".<n>2.

Option A - Restaurants: Restaurants may sell potatoes, but it is unlikely James would be able to get one in the case he needs it.<n>4.) Option B - Casserole: Casserole is a type of dish that contains many ingredients, so the potato would be mixed with other ingredients and would be difficult to identify.<n>5.) Option C - Root Cellar: Root cellars are often used to store root vegetables such as potatoes, so this is a possible place to find one.<n>6.) Option D - Pockets: James’ pockets may have a potato but its unlikely as the potato might have already been used in another dish such as a meal.<n>7.) Option E - Pantry: A pantry is a storage area that includes many different types of food.

Choices:  A: drop to zero B: increase C: cool down D: dropping quickly E: heat up<n>Output:		1. The sun was out and the temparature was changing rapidly. 2. We need to determine what option could have meant that the temperature was rapidly changing. 3. Option A: Drop to zero: It's not relevant here and doesn't seem plausible. 4. Option B: Increase: The correct answer should be related to increase since rapid increase is a good explanation for the temperature of the sun to be changing rapidly. 5. Option C: Cool Down: Another option could be that it is cooling down. Since it is cold enough for the temperature to change rapidly, this could potentially make the answer cooling down. However, we don't want the answer to be something that it would do as long as something is cold enough. 6. Option D: Dropping quickly: "Quickly" could mean "rapidly." 7. Option D: Cooling Down: This is the best choice because cooling down is the most plausible explanation for rapid rising and falling temperatures.<n><n>Input:Which of the following things cannot be reused?

There could be many different locations such as the grocery store, nightstand, armpits, own bathroom, medicine chest, etc.<n>2: Option B: nightstand. This is the most likely response since nightstands might be seen as the first thought when the spouse asks another person to look for something missing from the nightstand.<n>3: Options A, C, and E are outside the scope of possibilities while Option D is also unlikely because it does not specify what type of deodorant is missing.<n>4: After considering each of the options carefully, it is clear that choosing the nightstand is the best answer.<n>The final answer is B: nightstand<n><n>Input: Is there any way you can see a movie using just one screen in your current living situation? Choices:  Choices:  A; no B: Yes C: yes-you could watch a "mirror image" of yourself<n>Output: 1 - The question is asking whether there is a way to see a movie using one screen in your current situation. 2. There are two different choices given, both of which can be used to address this question. 3. Option A: no. In the majority of cases, only one screen is offered for movie viewing. So it would be impossible to view a movie with just one screen. 4. Option B: Yes. This option specifies that the movie can be watched on a mirror, where the person can see a "mirror image." 5. Option C: yes-you can watch yourself. This states that the movie can be displayed in such a way, such as being mirrored, such that the person watching the movie can see himself in the movie screen. So you could use this option as a potential answer. However, this is likely only possible if the mirror is large enough to display a person's entire body. 6. After carefully considering each option, we can conclude that the best answer is option B : Yes, you can watch a "mirror" movie, where you are the one watching your image on the screen.

Choices:  A: heart attacks B: hole in your socks C: exhaustion D: shortness of breath E: blisters<n>Output:		1) First, we understand the question as being about jogging all day. Therefore, if you did this, you would probably develop blisters.<n>2) Option A: The correct answer is "heart attacks", not "blisters". A person can get heart attack after jogging continuously for quite some time without rest.<n>3) Option B: The correct answer if "hole in your socks" rather than "exhaustion". When a person is continuously jogging all day, the chances of developing blisters and holes in the socks are high. This is true for any activity that involves the foot, such as ballet dancing or any other sport where the foot is repeatedly stressed. So "exhaustion" is not the correct answer.<n>4) Option C: The correct answer is not "exhaustion", that is another symptom of strenuous overnight jogging is "exhaustion."  Rather, it is "shortness of breath", an almost immediate symptom of overnight jogging without breaks.<n>5) Option D: The correct answer is heart attack, not "shortness of breath". Shortness of breath is a symptom of all types of injuries or exercise, not just running. Jogging without breaks for an entire day does not mean that you will reach a point where you can't breathe. You will still have a full amount of blood and will still be able to breathe.

Option D: playing marbles: These kids are likely not having fun at the end of the day, and it is unclear to me why they are still playing.<n>6. Option E: constructing. If they have been building something all day, they may be tired or even exhausted. If they have been constructing something all day, they're likely on a wild ride because they're likely racing to finish whatever they've begun to build as well as to get home or to go to bed (if it's evening already). So option E is the safest option here.<n>Because there is no mention about their parents, I do not feel like there is something wrong with option E. The choice of "construction" could mean play time, such as block play or Legos, but I think it's safe to pick this answer and move as though it is the correct one.<n><n>Input: In the movie, the child was going through an important what?

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:A strong laxative will help you keep what kind of bowel movements?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

Choices:  A: pocket B: office supply store C: friend's house D: desk drawer E: city hall<n>Output:		1: The question is asking about the places you might carry a pen in your day. 2: We then consider each of these options in greater detail and see what are the appropriate places to carry a pen. 3: Option A: Pocket would be the primary and most obvious place to carry a pen. As most people wear pants, there are pant pockets available to carry pen. Unless you were wearing all women's fashion, or were wearing cargo shorts that you have to roll up (unlikely to be the case), it would not be sensible to carry a pen in your pocket.<n>4: Option B: Office supply store would be correct if you did not need to carry a pen. If you were going to the office to purchase things to put in your pockets to carry you might carry a pen there. However, office supply stores are only open between 10 and 5 on weekdays and may be closed for the weekend, making this a questionable destination.<n>5: Option C: friend's House would be correct if you were visiting your friend's house and you knew ahead of time that your friend had a pen. Since friends are not likely to know about someone's pen collection, you would not know to expect a pen there.<n>6: Option D: Desk drawer should be the final choice for carrying the pen in the event you needed a pen quickly and did not have time to visit one of the other options, it would seem logical to reach for the pen from your desk drawer.<n>7: Option E: City Hall should not be the final choice for a pen because it does not seem to make practical sense. City Hall would not be relevant to the question because pens would not be available there, even though it may seem like it.

Choices:  A: board ship B: shout at C: smile at D: cross street E: feel happy<n>Output:		1) The question is asking how you can get the attention of a man across the room.<n>2) Option A: Board Ship: It is not possible to board a ship without making any sound.<n>3) Option B: Shout at: Shouting is one way to get the attention of a crowd but it is not possible to shout at a specific person in a crowd without making any sound. For the same reason, it is not possible to get the attention of someone in a room in this manner.<n>4)Option C: Smile at: Smiling is possible in a room but it is not enough as a person across a room cannot see you as they are far away and, therefore, may not catch your attention.<n>5) Option D: Cross Street: Crossing a street is possible in a room because you can cross one street at a time without making any sound but it is impossible to cross the street by going into a room and getting back out again without making any sound. Therefore, option D is incorrect.<n>6) Option E: Feel happy: This is an emotional state and not the method by which to get the attention of another person so this option is incorrect as well.<n>7) After examining all of the options, it can be concluded that boarding a vessel, shouting in a crowd, and crossing the street are not methods by which we can get the attention and, therefore, they are not the correct answers.<n>So the final answers are A, B, C.

Option A: sea world. If the sentence was, "card players sat emotionless in a tank at sea world," it would be likely that they were playing sea world.<n>3. Option B: court room. If the sentence was "card players sat empressless in a courtroom," it would be likely they were playing court room.<n>4. Option C: shallow waters. If the sentence was “card players sat emotionally in shallow water" then it is likely they were playing a shallow water game.<n>5. Option D: poker game. If the sentence said "card players sat emphatic in a game of poker” then it is likely they where playing poker.<n>6. Option E: card shark. If the sentence was 'card players sat emotional in a game of card shark" then it is likely that they are playing a card shark.<n>7.

Choices:  A: cattle ranch B: countryside C: grocery store D: slaughterhouse E: dairy farm<n>Output:		1: We start by stating what we know for sure. The farmer is compassionate, so he or she chose the cow a more humane death.<n>2: We consider each choice separately.<n>3: Choice A: cattle ranch - a cattle ranch is also a place where animals are farmed. The animals there could also live in horrible conditions, so it’s not clear whether they would receive a more humane death there.<n>4: Choice B: countrysides. In theory, the farmer could allow the cow to reside in the countryside. In the countryside, the cow could live in an open field or a pasture. Therefore, it is uncertain whether or not she would receive a more humble death.<n>5: Choice C: grocery Store. A grocery store only sells animals from where they are killed. They are unlikely to give the animals a humane death.<n>6: Choice D: slaughter house. Slaughter house is a place where animals are killed. Even though the animals are killed quickly, their death is still not considered humane.<n>7: Choice E: dairy farm. Although a dairy farm does not raise animals for meat, it also does not allow the animals freedom and has limited space. Animals on a dairy farm live in very crowded conditions. Therefore, it would probably raise concerns among those that are concerned about animal welfare.<n>8: So, the most probable answer is choice A: cattle ranch.<n><n>

There are only 10 different digits that could be in that number. Each of these digits occurs in the number an equal number of times. How many different numbers I am thinking of? Choices: A:6 B:4 C:8 D:7 E: 3<n><n>#### Output: The above question is asking about a number whose digits are all numbers between 0 and 9 - for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, with two digits each. The only ten numbers that each occur the same number of times in a two digit string are the numbers 0, 1, 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 (so, there are only ten different numbers that could be in that string), and there are ten different numbers in that string (so that you can multiply the number of times each digit appears in the string by the number of times each different digit is represented in the string in order to obtain the correct number). Since each of those ten numbers can be represented using either the digit itself (for example, 7) or using the digits in some order (such as 37, 73, etc), the number of different strings in which any particular given two digit number may be written in is 10², or a total of 1

Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:The human looked down longingly as he sat in the orbiting space station, what did he miss? Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n>Output:		<n>	1. The question is about a human who looks down longingly as he sits in the orbiting space<n>	2. Station<n>       3.  We can only decide which answer is the correct one if we know what he misses.<n>       4.  We may assume that this is when he is going for a space walk.<n>       5.  As such we may rule out choice D<n>       6.  Answer 1A could be correct, but may not be as he may miss the nearby house as he will be going out into space, but will probably use the toilet or something inside the space station.<n>       7.  Answer 2B may be correct as some workplaces may have toilets.<n>       8.  Answer 3C might be correct, although we don't know if the space station he is looking longingly out of is at a great height.<n>       9.  Answer 4D could also be correct, but the only office blocks on the Earth are probably in the same city, so he has to choose between B and C<n>       10.  Answer 5E could be correct<n>       11.  So the final answer is A<n><n>Input:Where would the best place to build a water tower be? Choices: A: by a river B: in someones back garden C: in a cave D: in a mountain range<n>Output:<n>		1. The question asks where you would build a water tower.<n>		2. We can only decide which is the correct answer if we know where the best place would be.<n>		3. Therefore we will look at each of the options to see if we can rule out any of them.<n>		4. Option A: by a river.<n>		5. As a water tower is used to store water from a river in order to provide it to other people, having a water tower by a river is the best place to<n>		build a water tower.

The main idea of the question is that Sam left his shoes in a public area, and we have to predict where he would go.<n>3. Option a: Department store - We can not assume that Sam would have muddy shoes if he were at a department store.<n>4. Option b: School - It's possible that Sam may be going to school, but we can not assume that he would leave his muddy shoes anywhere near the school building.<n>5. Option c: Garden - It's possible for Sam to go to the garden, and it's possible for him to leave his muddy shoess there. This is mainly because a garden is an area outside that he could be visiting, and he may have been wearing them before visiting.<n>6. Option b: Office building - If Sam were going to an office building, he would probably remove his muddy shoes before going inside, and it's unlikely that he would carry his them with him. Therefore, we can rule out this option.<n>7. Option D: house - We can assume that Sam would be leaving his muddy shoes near his house, and it's very likely that he would be going to a house. So, option E is the final answer.<n><n>Input: If you like movies and you're thirsting for adventure, what would you most likely say? Choices: A: Can I get a water? B: Please bring me my movie!

Choices:  A: determination B: upper hand C: superior D: higher position E: skill<n>Output:		1) We have a phrase "reaching an advantageous position". Since it is talking about the position of you (in terms of others) we need to consider the choices which can be answered in a single sentence. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B, which is not in the sentence.<n>2) The phrase "determination puts me in what position" implies a specific kind of position where the person has decided to be more motivated in the competitin. Since the phrase only says something about the position which the person has chosen, it is not directly related to the question "as compared to others". Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice A ("determination").<n>3) Similarly, answer choice B cannot be the answer as it is talking about a "superior position" which could be a position in the competition, but not a position compared to other participants.<n>4) Now we can eliminate choices D and E which don't have correct verb/vocabulary combinations.<n>5) We are left with only answer choice C: "an upper hand" which is a position compared to others.<n>It is clear that the answer is C: "an upper Hand"<n><n>Input:A group of 4 people, who cannot speak english or any other language, visit india.

We can reason that if a person is liked by a lot of people, they would be approached by those people. But this is not an exhaustive list of possible reasons.<n>3. Option C: knows all. It is true that if a person knows a lot, they would be approached more than if they didn't know a lot. But again, the premise of the question is that they are APPROACHED by other people and not specifically sought out for information.<n>4. Option E: understand themselves. It is not clear if the question is asking about a reason why the person would be approached by others in general or specifically if the person understands themselves. We can't determine that from the question alone.<n>5. Option A: care about. The question does not specify whether these people are approach the person because they care about the person. If they are approaching the person simply because they care, it is likely in order to give the person support, not necessarily because they care about the specifics of the person's life. <n>6. Option B: being complimented. It is natural to talk to someone if they compliment you on something, regardless of how you feel about the thing they complimented you on. So, being complimented by someone might not be the main motivation for people to approach and talk to the person.<n>7. Option D: popularity. While it is true that the person will be approached by more people because of their popularity, it is not the only reason why people would approach them. Other reasons include being well known because they care about the individual or being asked for help (though the question does not specify what kind of help will be asked for).<n>8. After considering these options, it is clear the most likely reason why someone is approached is because others care about them.<n>So the final correct answer is c: know all<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What might a satisfied person do?

If we have just acquired a new chess set, we may want to store the pawn and other pieces in a separate place until we know which pieces we want on the board.<n>4: Option B: strategy. When we're choosing a strategy for chess and we're not yet sure which pawn to use, we may think about where different pawns could go on the board and choose the one that's most advantageous.<n>5: Option C: toy store. A toy store could be an option if we're looking for a new chess set and want to temporarily store our pawn until we purchase it.<n>6: Option D: chess game. If we're finishing or restarting a chess game and don't necessarily want any of the pawns to be "used" again, we could put the pawn in a chess game and not worry about accidently using it.<n>7: Option E: small case. If we're on a trip and have limited space for our luggage and would like to conserve space, we could put the chess pawn in a small case and not use the more bulky chess set.<n>8. After evaluating all of the options, it is evident that option A, the chess set, is the only one that wouldn't require the chess pawn to be used.<n>Therefore the final answer is A : chess set<n><n>Input: What can be found at a chess set, but not on a blank chessboard? Choices: 1: A: chess pawn B: pieces C: set D: game<n>Output: 1 : The question is asking where one can find the chess pawn at a chess set but not on a chess board.<n>2 : We then consider each of choices C and D in the question.<n>3 : Option D : game. It is not possible for a game to contain pieces for a chess game and be played on the same board and not contain the pawn.<n>4 : Option E : set - the set would be a set used at home, not the playing set.<n>5 : Option F: pieces - a chess

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

After considering all the choices, we find that none of the options satisfies all the requirements of the question. Concert, home, airport, and university seem like places where the security guard can use the golf cart to patrol and navigate between different locations. However, college does not include enough young adults to justify the usage of a golf cart by security guards.<n><n>So the final answer should be: college.<n><n>### Part 2: Fill in the blank.

We consider each of the choices.<n>3. Option B: in a bin near the exit: It is a good guess that a potato peeler would be inside the bin. Aside from that, there are no other plausible locations for the potahtoe pealer.<n>4. Option C: in storage: A potato peeler may be stored with other dishware, but it is also possible to find it in the kitchen or dining area.<n><n>5. Option D: on the dinner table: We'd expect to find it on the dining table where they serve the food.<n>6.

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n>Output:		1) A Beaver is not a sentient animal and doesn't have any books.<n>2) It can build a dam with sticks that is used to block a body of water but not any zoos.<n>3) A Beaver cannot build a structure that would keep a body of water dry.<n>4)  So the right answer must be the 4th one<n>5) If the dam is to stop the flow of the water from the river so a lake can be formed, then it becomes a body of water. The lake is a body of water. So the dam makes it so the water in the lake isn't flowing back into the river.<n>6) We are dealing with the 2nd option now.<n>7) The 4th means a Beaver won't stop the flow of water. <n>8) The 6th is not a feature. <n>So for the Beaver to build a dam with straw for blocking flow of the water in a river or lake, then the right answer must be E: animals.

It can house computers or terminals as well as people, but it isn't just part of the building.<n>5: Option B: hallway. You do not commonly have traders on the hallways in an exchange building. A trading floor is more like a specialized venue for the trading activity, not just a few hallways. <n>6: Option C: table. This option is also not the right answer. The option would make more sense if the question was asking about the floor of a trading table.<n>7: Option D: exchange. This one fits the question closely. When you enter an exchange, you often enter the trading floor. This is where most of the trading activity occurs.<n>8. Option E: office: This is not the right answer.

Instead, it may be better to get started right away and then make adjustments as needed.<n>4. Option b: Execution. According to the question, this means to start with the first step in the project. Therefore, it is best to first start with something and then modify it as needed.<n>5. Option c: assessment.

Choices:  A: satisfied B: unnecessary C: luxury D: sufficient E: extra<n>Output:		1 The question is asking what something would be if you do not use it.<n>2. We can conclude that the choices are Satisfied, Unnecessary, Luxury, Sufficient and Extra, but we do not use any of them or the word they.<n>3. Consider options: A: Satisfied: This refers to a sense of fulfillment or happiness, which does not involve a literal need for anything. If someone is satisfied with their possessions or situation, they do not consider these needs as necessary or essential.In this case, the person does not have a real need and is not looking for anything.<n>4. Option: B: Unnecessary: This choice refers to something that is not required or important and can be discarded or not used. In this case, it may be that the question is referring to a need for something and is asking which of the items might not be needed. Since you would choose Satisfied over Unnecessary, then this is the right answer.<n>5. Option: C: Luxury: This is a choice that refers to something that is more than just basic or necessary and can be used for pleasure or as an accessory. The word luxury does not include a literal need or requirement, so if you select this option, you are indicating that something may not be necessary for a person or that they could easily choose not to use it.<n>6. Option: D: Sufficient: This is a choice referring to something that is enough to meet a need, or that provides what is needed in order to satisfy a requirement. In this choice, you are saying that something may not be used since it does not meet all of the requirements of a person or their needs, so if this were selected, then you think it can be ignored or not used.<n>7. Option: E: Extra: This is the choice indicating something that is in excess of something else and not necessary or important. If someone has something extra, then they have more than they need.<n>8. After carefully considering all the possibilities, the answer is found to be B: Unnecessary, as this word does not require you to meet any other needs or requirements beyond basic necessities or what is needed by definition.<n><n>Input: Is it possible to find a use for a wall where no one lives?

Choices:  A: doctor's office B: hospital C: apartment D: study E: furniture store<n>Output:		1: A: doctor's offices have a variety of furniture used by several patients.<n>2: B: Hospitals have a wide range of furniture, such as exam tables, beds, and chairs, used by many people.<n>3: C: This answer is incorrect as the apartment does not describe where the armchair would be used by very few people.<n>4: D: Since the study refers to the living space of individual students at a university, it would not fit with the description as the students would all have their own furniture and a shared living space with their housemates.<n>5: E: The furniture store provides new furniture to multiple customers. Thus, they are not used by only a few.<n>6: The answer to this question is incorrect as an armchair is used by many people as it is a common piece of furniture in many homes, offices, and public areas. This fact nullifies the "only a few people" part of the question<n>7: A: A doctor's office would have many patients and therefore does not fit the description.<n>8: By evaluating the options in detail, all other options are eliminated. The only place that fits the description is the apartment as only one or two people typically occupy an apartment or a rented room.<n>So the final answers are A: apartment and B: hospital

This statement does not need to be true or false; this statement only needs to be possible.<n>3) B: annoy people or around. Since it is stated that she sings too much, it is possible that she sings so much that she annoys people around her. Therefore, she only needs to sing one too much for there to be possibility that she annoys people.<n>4) C: enjoy or inhale. It is clearly not stated whether she enjoys singing or whether she has a good enough voice that she can inhale. However, since it is stated that she "sings too much", it could mean she enjoys singing or has a good enough voice.<n>5) D: The question does not state that she has a good voice when she sings, only that she sings excessively.<n>6) Since we have determined that insane is not a possibility, annoy is not a valid response.

If you're looking to keep your clothes off the dirty floor, the linen closet is a good place to keep them.

This is because, the kitchen is specifically designed around cleaning and food preparation and it is therefore more likely that the floor will be clean and free of any debris or stains.<n>5: Option C: On the Space Heater. In this case, option C is not a valid answer because the space heater is not specifically designed to hold clothes. The space heater is primarily used for heating the room and does not have any built-in storage for clothes. <n>6: Option: D: Fabric Store. <n>If you're looking to find storage for new clothes for your home, a good option is to go to a fabric store. <n>Many fabric stores, typically have a designated area within the store which is specifically designed for storing clothes.<n>7: Option E: Bedroom. If you are looking for a place to put your clothes that are not yet placed or stored where they belong, then you should consider the bedroom. The bedroom is typically the room where people sleep, and it is therefore more than likely that the floor will not be covered in clothes at any given time.<n>8: So, the final answer is Option B (The Kitchen)<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What is an way for people to meet with each other? Choices:  A: believe in god B: pay bills C: group together D: enjoy themselves E: face each other<n>Output:		1.)This question is asking what is an way for people (the singular pronoun "people" refers to the class/group of individuals), to meet with each other.<n>2.)In this context, "believe in god" and "enjoy themselves" do not make sense. <n>3.) "Pay bills", "Group together" and "Face each other" are words that people use to get together, but only "Face each other" can be considered to be specifically for the purpose of getting together.<n>4.)This reduces to the answer choice D: enjoy themselves.<n><n>Input:How could the boy clean the carpet? Choices: 1. spill something on it 2. put things on top of it 3. take all the toys out 4. walk on it<n>Output: 1) The question is asking how the boy could clean the carpet. (2 is not possible because it only needs cleaning - 2 would be "How could the boy keep the carpet clean?")<n>2) All the other options would all entail cleaning the carpet. <n>3) "take all the toys out" doesn't refer to cleaning the carpet because it is not in a way to clean the carpet. 4) "walk on it" is not an option at all because it is a way to put toys on the carpet or put something on top of the carpet, but not to clean the carpet itself.<n>

Choices:  A: cupboard B: chocolate C: coffee D: candy bar E: soda pop<n>Output:		1) The question is asking about what food you can fit "one hand" and it can be either sweet or savory.<n>2) All of the given choices are appropriate since they are all appropriate "snacks" that can be considered food and fit in one hand. However, the snacks mentioned in the answer options contain a lot of sugar, including refined white sugar, sucrose, fructose, lactose, and glucose. So these snacks are not healthy.<n>3) Since these foods contain a lot of sugar for such a small snack, you should have them in moderation.<n>4) Therefore, the correct answer is all the answer options (A, B, C, and E).<n><n>Input: What would happen if you ate too much food? Choices: 1: The food in your stomach would bounce off the walls. 2: It would spill out like a volcano 3: You'd die on the spot<n>Output:There may be many different health issues that happen if you eat too much. However, the question asks specifically about bizarre effects, so the options given should be somewhat strange.<n>5) Option 1: "The food in your stomaches would bounce off the wall." This seems physically impossible unless your meal is so big you'd eat into your stomachs lining.<n>6) Option 2: "You'd die on the spotto." You could also die of suffocation, so it is not really accurate.<n>7) option 3: "Spill like a volcano." If you were to eat your meal in a volcano while standing at the bottom, the food may spill out in an uncontrolled fashion, but this can be averted if you take time to eat, making it less "bizarre." So the correct answer is options 2 and 3.<n><n>Input: There many types of what food. Choices:  A- Fruit B- Snacks C- Salty Foods D- Vegetables <n>Output: There many types. Options can be both common and unusual. Each different is not given a point unless all the other options have been found and have a different food category.<n>8) Fruit is considered fruit when they're picked fresh, or canned if they are preserved by being made into a syrup.<n>

Choices:  A: antique store B: in the graveyard C: kitchen D: junk yard E: ice<n>Output:		1. The question is "where would you dispose of a...icebox". This would likely be in a place where a homeowner would store their old kitchen electrical equipment.<n>2. We must consider each of the given possible answers:<n>3. Option A (antique store), not likely. The question specifically mentions an "icebox", so this probably refers to a very old icebox that uses ice, rather than a new refrigerator. As of this writing, antique stores do not carry 19th century iceboxes. Therefore, this answer is not correct.<n>4. Option E: ice, not a good idea. If the icebox is broken in this kind of way, the answer might be to discard the entire icebox rather than just the ice.<n>5. Option D: 'junk yard'. Disposing of a broken ice-box to a junk-yard is an obvious choice here.<n>6. Option B (graveyard) is an interesting option but it would mean the owner would have to dig a hole and bury an icebox in a ground that could potentially have ice frozen to it, especially if it is not summer. This could create very difficult cleanup, if not entirely impossible.<n>7. Option C (kitchen). This would mean the owner would need to find an appropriate spot in the kitchen - the area where an icebox would actually be used and stored.<n>8. Option C (in the kitchen) would only be appropriate if the icebox could be restored and used again. An icebox is a household electrical appliance and it's much more likely to be thrown out or donated than to be refurbished.<n>9. Therefore the final answer is D: Junk yard<n><n>Input:Which two things would be found in a room occupied by a person suffering from the flu?

Choices:  A: lake B: aquariums C: swimming pool D: pond E: childrens pools<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what type of body of water is typically comprised of shallow water.<n>2) Consider the 5 options and weigh the possibilities.<n>3) Option A: lake. Lakes have the characteristics of both a sea and a pond, which means that both sea and pond have shallow water and deep water. Therefore, lakes generally have shallow water, but not always.<n>4) Option B: aquariums. An aquarium is a small body of water for aquatic creatures to thrive in, but for humans, they contain aquatic and maritime organisms and are therefore not good places to swim. Therefore, they are not a good choice.<n>5) Option C: swimming pool. This is an obvious answer, since when you fill a swimming pool with water, the deeper part of the pool will remain and the shallow part of the pool will empty in time. Therefore, this is a correct answer.<n>6) Option D: pond. As we have stated already, option A: lake, is a likely response because lakes can contain shallow water, even though they can also contain deep water. Option D, Pond, is a valid alternative because we can say that in many cases, it contains shallow water. But what if you go out into the middle of a lake and dive below the surface? Well, that would be like diving into the pond, and since both ponds and lakes can contain shallowed water, option D is valid.<n>7) Option E: childrens pool. This answer is an accurate response because when you fill a children's pool with water, you end up with a pool that is shallow in its depth from its bottom to a reasonable level. And when you leave it open, the shallow water will remain and the deeper water in the pool will evaporate due to the heat emitted by the sun in the sky above it.<n>Option D, Pond, also has a possibility of being the answer because there is a possibility of shallow water in that situation. In summary, Option D, pond, and Option E, childs' pool are the only options that are not completely invalid, and therefore they can both be valid answers to this question.<n>The final answer is A: lakes<n>

"Plain" sounds like something that you may say from your point of view to describe the feeling of the clouds as being "plain" (not a fancy or unique thing to look at). But no matter what you think of the clouds, your experience will not affect what is happening in the surrounding environment of clouds. The "plain" is an emotional response to the clouds' appearance and serves no function in what happens around the clouds.<n>4: Option B: cold. Clouds can bring snow, rain, or high humidity that could potentially make things cold or wet around you. However, the word does not imply that this happens instantly or is inevitable. <n>5: Option C: dull. The clouds may affect the lighting of the environment. However, it is not dull for your individual experience.<n>6: Option D: bad. "Bad" is another out of context usage. Clouds do not have any inherent ability to make or make things "bad" or negative for you.<n>7: Option E: wet. The clouds bring precipitation and may make your clothes wet. However, this does not mean that you will become "wet" (referring to damp, soggy, dripping) or that there will be wetness around you everywhere as a byproduct of clouds.<n>8: It is clear from the options that the correct answer is Option B: cold or Option B: wet. Clouds may bring rain or snow that could be cold or wet for you.<n><n>Input:Your parents decide to get some new, fancy curtains. You try them out at their suggestion and find something interesting.

If they are fancy, and you try them out, they may make the room look different compared to before. <n>2. Consider all the options and evaluate them to see which is consistent with the context of the question.<n>3. Option B: bigger. Fancy curtains may mean extra large ones.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:When a snake prefers warm, sunny weather, where would it likely want to live? Choices:  A: pet shops B: new mexico C: white house D: arctic E: garden of eden<n>Output:		If we first try to interpret all the choices, the following can be deduced:<n><n>"New Mexico" does not look familiar like a place where the sun would shine. I doubt this is correct.<n>The "Garden of Eden" does not seem like a place with sun either. It may not even exist. So I don't think this is correct either.<n>Arctic is definitely a cold place which would not provide the snake with warmth. That is not what it wants. So that is incorrect.<n>The "White House" has to be ruled out because it serves as the residence of the president, which the snake doesn't really sound like.<n>"Pet Shops" could be a good place for the snake because there it will most likely come across snakes and perhaps in the wild. But there may not be much sun. Also, since pet shops have many snakes present, it could also be crowded. So that is also out of the question.<n>That leaves us with the options of A: "Arctic" and B: "Garden of Eve" as the only remaining options. If we eliminate the other options, we arrive at the correct answer, which is B: "Garden Of Eden" <n><n>### Instruction:How to solve problems on a chalkboard<n><n>### How to answer multiple choice questions of this programming course:<n>Solve it

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

Choices:  A: health club B: jocks C: fitness centre D: stadium E: gymnasium<n>Output:		1: This is a tricky question. According to the context, a green drink implies the consumption of a health drink, rather than a type of beverage that would contain alcohol. There are a few options available to meet a need for a green drink: the locker room, jocks, fitness center, stadium, gym.<n>2: The first four options are all related to physical activity. It is reasonable to assume that one can access a green drink in these outlets.<n>3: Stadium and gym are not likely to have green drinks. While a stadium may carry some kind of drinks, they would not be a health drink, but rather the type of beverage that is alcoholic or sugary.<n>4: The other two options, jocks and fitness center, make logical sense as outlets where alcohol would never be offered. However, it is not completely unreasonable that some place claiming to be a fitness center would actually be licensed to serve alcohol.<n>5: It can be established that there are outlets where there are green drinks available. Jocks is the only outlet with a reasonable chance of serving such a drink. This makes option Jocks the final answer.<n><n>The input was (2 questions), which translated to (2) = a=1, b=4, c=4, d=4, e=3, f=4<n><n>### Total Result <n>4 out of 4 correct  answer = 100%<n>

Where might he go? Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n>Output:		1, race track can be crowded as it is a sporting activity and there are many sport activities happening in sports centers.<n>2. Population areas have more people living in them so it might be full of people.<n>3. The desert might have a few people traveling through it, but not very many.<n>4, At an apartment you probably won't find very many people, since it is usually only one family living in each apartment.<n>5. On the road you might find a few people. You might pass through a few towns before finishing your ride.<n>6. After considering all the choices, you would not expect to find as many people at a race track as some other options would have. The most people you are probably to find here would be at the apartment.<n>So the final choice is A: apartment.

Choices:  A: radio shack B: substation C: cabinet D: television E: desk<n>Output:		1:We can assume that the question refers to the home and not to a business setting since home entertainment equipment may not all be available through office-grade systems.<n><n>2: Consider each of the given options :<n><n>3: Option A: radio shack. We don’t see any reason to assume that radio shack would be the best or worst source for home entertainment equipment. In fact, most of the goods you’d need for home entertainment are usually sold at large retail outlets such as Radio Shack anyway. However, there may be some niche options available through smaller retailers like these.<n>4: Option B: substation. There are many businesses that sell components or components-only systems for home entertainment needs. However, these systems are usually expensive and do not come with a TV or a tuner card installed in the desktop.<n>5: Option C: cabinet. This option should be removed as the context makes it less likely that one could find an appropriate cabinet for cable connections at a retailer.<n><n>6: Option D: television. Most modern TVs have digital in, so the possibility of connecting a cable to the TV is almost non-existent. It’s possible that a TV could be connected to a computer in some cases using DVI. However, these cases are extremely rare. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to find a DVI port connected to the TV without the DVI source to go with it.<n>7: Option E: desk. The desk cannot directly be connected to a cable without the cable and the desk-connected equipment being designed specifically for the connection and that is extremely unlikely.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer has to be B: substation.<n><n>Input: Which type of television antenna requires a good TV antenna? Choices: 1: A) indoor B) outdoor C) rooftop D) amplified<n>Output: 1) The question asks us, which type of TV antenna, requires a good TV antena.<n>2) We can eliminate options A, B, and D as these options would not require a good TV antenna.<n>3) Option C: rooftop can mean a TV antenna that receives signals directly from the television broadcast station. Some of these are capable of receiving signals within the range of a TV antenna that needs to receive signals directly from a television broadcast station.<n><n>

We consider each of the given choices, to see if they are suitable or not.<n>3. Option (A): make breakfast. Making breakfast is only the first step in your cooking. You still have to bring it to a boil, fry it, etc. So, making breakfast is not the first step to cooking <n>4. Option (B): go hiking. Going hiking wouldn't do you any good if the camp is far away from the nearest convenience store, you lack ingredients, etc.<n>5. Option (C): pack or bag. Packing is only the second step after you bring your ingredients back from the mall, store.<n>6. Option (D): light fire. Lighting fire cannot be the first step to cook food, unless you're using an open camp fire like the one on a camp ground.<n>7. Option (E): grab a match.

Option 1(Maine): If you think about it, Maine is east coast, so this answer is correct.<n>4. Option 2 (Boston): Boston is south of Maine, so Boston is not in the east coast.<n>5. Option 3 (Beach Town): Someone who is coming from a seafarer and traveling to a beach may want to eat seafood at a beach town. Thus this is a correct answer.<n>6. Option 5 (Coastal Cities) Coastal cities can be an option because coastal cities are places that are close to oceans too.<n>7. Option 6 (Ocean): If you are by the ocean, you can find seafood restaurants there.<n>8. There is only one out of 5 options that fits the criteria, and that is Option 1(Mane).

Choices:  A: costly B: captive C: contained D: paying E: caught<n>Output:		1.'The child's parents soon discovered...'. The game promised the parents that it is free, but after some time, the parents soon discovered that in fact, they had been doing what for microtransctions.<n>2. 'Costly' is the best answer choice because it best reflects the theme and the context of the question/answer. Even if the parents did not directly pay for the microtransactions, they spent a lot of money on buying additional in game resources that could be purchased through microtransactions.<n>3. 'Captive' is not the best answer choice as it does not relate to the game and the microtransactions. Captive means something held, restricted, or confined, which does not reflect the context of the original question.<n>4. 'Contained' is not the best choice as although it may be technically correct, it carries a different meaning. Contained means restricted to certain area or to certain substance, which does not reflect how the microtransactions were tied to the game.<n>5. 'Paying' would be the correct answer if the context was the exact opposite of the original question: the child's parents paid a fee because they played a video game. But in this answer choice, the child's parents did have access to completely free in game resources, although some of them were obtained through microtransactions. This does not align with the context of the question.<n>6. 'Caught' is not the correct answer because it is not referring to anything relating to microtransactions or playing video games. When a parent or teacher 'catches' a child, they discover or realize that a child has done something wrong.<n>So the correct answer is A: costly<n><n>Input: Which is the correct answer? Choices: 1. C: Fahrenheit 352<n>2. B: Degree Above Normal <n>3. C: 98.56 percent<n>4. D: Normal <n>5. E: Degree Below Normal <n>Output: 1, 'C: Fahrenheit 212' is not the correct choice. This answer choice refers to a fictional temperature that is higher than boiling point of water.<n>2. 'B: Degree ABOVE Normal' is incorrect because it refers to a higher than normal temperature, which is more than 98.8 degrees F, rather than a lower

Where might he have been? Choices:  A: disneyland B: snow C: windowsill D: street E: summer<n>Output:		1..The sun had been hot on his bare feet, and he knew in that instant, he was on an asphalt/sand road.<n>2. Option A: Disneyland. He could not have been at Disneyland because it is a land where you would get cold, not hot.<n>3. Option B: snow. The sunshine had made it very hot, so it is unlikely that he was in a snowy place.<n>4. Option C: windowsill. As it was said it made the surface hot, the surface would most likely have been hot enough to burn his feet. He is probably not standing on windowsill then.<n>5. Option D: street. When sunshine is hot, it burns the surface beneath. On a street with high traffic, his shoes could have been burnt.<n>6. Option E: summer. Most likely, he would be somewhere on a warmer place during the summer time. If it's winter, the temperature would be much cooler. If it's in the rainy season, it could have been damp and a potential spot for slipping.<n>After considering all of the options, it is most likely that he would be on a street with a surface hot enough to burn his skin.<n>So the final correct answer is D: street<n><n>Input: I don't like coffee in the morning, but I think I will have coffee after work because I know I need caffeine.  Does this mean that I must like coffee?  Choices:  A. Nope B. No C. Yes D. Absolutely<n>Output: 1....It is stated that I don't like to drink coffee in the morning.<n>2. Option B: No. The question then states that I like coffee after work. From this statement, it's easy to imply that I don't drink coffee very regularly, hence I don't drink it in the morning, as it would most likely cause negative emotions.<n>3. Nope. I have decided that "I will drink coffee after work because I need caffeination," does not mean that I need to like coffee.<n>4. No. There are many reasons why a person doesn't like doing something.<n>After considering all the options, the answer is clearly B: no.

In the ocean, there are not musicians playing the Cello. The reason is that the ocean is very deep, and it is dangerous to play cello in the deep sea.<n>5) Option B: symphony. In a symphony, we play with different types of instruments. There are a lot of different musicians in a symphony, but we won't find someone playing the Cello there.<n>6) Option C: Band. The band is usually a small musical ensemble consisting of a woodwind instrument, brass instrument, percussion instruments, and sometimes string instruments. But we all know that Cello is not considered to be a normal musical instrument in a band. So, there will not be someone playing the cello in a band.<n>7) Option D: music store. In a musical store, we will find many instruments that may include one or more type of cello, which we can play with them. So this option will be true.<n>8) Option E: music shop. In a musical shop, we will find many musical instruments that may include one type of cello (e.g., we will find double bass). So this option will be also true.<n>9) And finally, when we consider all the options, it can be seen that none of the options satisfies the question.<n>10) So the final answer is band, or a musical store, or cello musicians.

Choices:  A: child's hand B: the last straw C: hobby shop D: end of line E: toy store<n>Output:		1. The statement "because she wasn't careful" implies that Sally lost the kite due to laxity, and there was more string on her spool, but the amount was insufficient.<n>2. In the given context, a "spool" is a coil of string used to wind, and the kitten could be lost when she was trying to fasten the string to the spool.<n>3. Option C: the last straw. If the spool is a container for cord-length, when Sally reached for the last thread on the spool, she misjudged the length and might have been unable to re-attach the kite to the cord.<n>4. However, option C is not the correct answer because a kite is not a "string" and this statement does not make sense, as a "spool" cannot be "attached" to anything.<n>5. Option D: toy store. At the toy store, Sally was trying to find a different length of cord but was using the incorrect spool and as a result miscalculated the distance and lost her kite.<n>6. Option E: end of line.

According to Bridge Magazine, there were "more than 8,500 alcoholics on state-funded insurance in 2004, including 4,629 in prison and jail." 9(Alcohol, Other Drug and Mental Health Services Division of the California Department of Health Services Bureau of Health Information and Analysis (BHIA) Substance Use Disorders in California: Report of Alcohol use Disorders in Adults in California. Sacramento, Calif.: Alcohol, Other Dug and Mental Health Services, California Department of Health Services, Bureau of Health Information and 10 Analsysis, May 2004) As Ben spent 8 years somewhere and 5% of the total population of state funded insurance were alcoholics (with one percentage point of them being imprisoned), we can conclude that Ben was in a prison.<n>

Potatoes are expensive (high in price) but the cash back is less, thus the price of the potatoes (higher) and the total cash back (lower) would make it a discount.<n>2. A discount is a reduction in price and is generally understood as a permanent or temporary reduction in price for an product sold. A discount is given to increase the sale of the product which may or may not be refunded after some time. The cash back which we get from a sale is refunded only in a limited time limit.<n>3. A potato is a root vegetable widely grown in Ireland and America, and it is typically white though with an exception of yellow and red variants. It is eaten raw or cooked and served in several ways including simply roasted, boiled, mashed, fried and baked. A discount is any reductions made in price, cost etc. A discount is also a reduction in some particular values like the discount which is applied to a product when you bring it back (when you return it in an used condition and buy it again) or when you get a cash back.<n>4.

For any kind of digital file, they have to consider option C: computer.<n>4. However, a computer’s a big piece of electronic machinery which does not allow someone to keep the digital file on the computer itself.<n>5. That’s because all we need is a file system to store our digital files in our computer hard drive.<n>6. For that we could have any sort of file system such as cloud storage, USB hard drive, hard drive, SD card, optical disk, etc.<n>7. There are multiple options to keep our files, but not the entire file system.<n>8. Therefore, in option C, a computer, we can store one particular file on the computer, but not the entire digital file system.<n>That’s why only options A: suitcase and E: cloud are not right.<n>9. Option B: filing cabinet is close. We could store physical files. However, storing physical files on a digital file system also requires us to make that digital file system.<n>10. Option D: desk drawers only allow us to store physical files.<n>11. Hence, the only option which allows us to store an entire digital file system physically is option E: cloud.<n><n>Input: When would you be interested in getting a tattoo?Choices:  A: New Year Day B: Labor Day C: Christmas Day D: Valentine’s Day E: None of the above<n>Output: 1)  What is the meaning of a tattoo?<n>2)  What are the possible times in a year where a person may have an interest in getting a tattoos, other than none of the above?<n>3)  So what are some other options?<n>4)  What are the meaning and possible times?<n>5)  Based on the meaning and possible times, choose one of the options.<n><n><n>* [Part A](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C61RqmKZzf3zLmrA983Y8p9YVoVpSJr0kgnQZXfE0Vc/edit?usp

It can refer to a verbal disagreement, but it can also mean physical fighting or other forms of assault.<n>4. “stress“  it also means “to feel or express great mental distress or anxiety”. It could refer to physical fighting or a verbal argument.<n>5. “debate“  It means “a formal discussion in which a group of people with different ideas or opinions on some subject discuss their differences“.<n>6. Argument is a difference in thought between two or more people. In a word "arguing" means "having a disagreement or dispute, or fighting"<n>7. “tension“ It usually refers to something that is mentally uncomfortable or worrying, but sometimes it specifically refers to "muscular tension" as in "physical tension".<n>8. So the "correct" answer would be "winning or loosing" because that is the only one that describes what you would have to get into if you're a "two-person competing".<n><n>Input:If you are going to buy a new suit, how likely is it that you will buy it online in addition to buying it in a store in person?

We consider each of the given possibilities as an option where a paper notice might be placed.<n>3. Option "A: front door" would be the most likely place for a paper notice to be.<n>4. Option "B: conference": There are cases in which notices may be put up around a conference table or at the main entrance to a building. Still, a conference cannot be considered to have the same potential as the front door, which is one of the main ways used to enter a house.<n>5. Option "C: classroom": Similar considerations can be made for a classroom, namely that a notice is likely to be hung on the door if it refers to the class, but it might not be placed on the front door if it refers to other matters.<n>6. Option "D: refrigerator": A notice might be left in a refrigerator if it's pertaining to things inside the refrigerator or if it includes food items with the information on how to keep them fresh longer. But it's likely that anything put up in the fridge wouldn't refer to matters related to the house itself (e.g., notices for the neighborhood or building).<n>7. Option "E: suitcase" – This would be a very remote possibility. A note put in a suitcase might mean that its owner is leaving the house, and while a note such as this might be left in the front door for the person who is leaving the house, it could also be left on the floor or somewhere else if nobody is home.<n><n>Input:  A: the best location for someone to start a book club is their home B: at a library C: a place where people eat vegetables D: an area of their home with a high concentration of cats E: someplace to take a nap<n>Output: 1.'A' because any place that is related to libraries is far better than a 'book club'.<n>2.'C' because the place where cats are located in a house.<n>3.'D' because home is where you sleep in.<n>

We know that the Indian Ocean is an ocean and we also know that we are talking about a marsian.<n>3: Now we can eliminate some options; we know that the options that can be eliminated are Asia, South and Earth as they all don't seem to have anything to do with the ocean that we are after. Earth only makes sense if it is to be considered as a planet that it is on.<n>4: However, this is not the case. Since Asia and South both only serve to eliminate themselves we are left with options: planet, and east. We can say that the Indian Ocean could be found somewhere in Asia or the South, but a Marsian could also come across this ocean somewhere in the past. The east answer is also eliminated as Earth is not a planet.<n>5: So now we are left with options planet and East, and it is clear that the ocean could be found in or around the East as it is where Mars starts as seen and the world starts spinning.<n>6: But because we are talking about Mars, this answer cannot work, thus it is clear that the planet is where you would find the Indian Ocean, no matter what position the planet is located in.<n><n>I hope it makes sense.

Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If I have to keep track of how much oxygen there is, where am I? Choices:  A: air B: water C: earth D: space shuttle E: tunnel<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where to go if I have to keep track on oxygen. 2) We then consider each of choices. 3) Air is where the majority of oxygen is, so I probably need to go there to keep track on o2 balance. 4) Space shuttle might be wrong because there is no oxygen there, so it is probably not where to go. 5) The tunnel where I am probably wrong because there is not that much oxygen there. 6) Earth is probably not where I need to go because of abundance of oxygen in air itself. 7) Water might have little oxygen, and it usually takes some skills to do oxygen monitoring, so it is probably wrong as well. 8) This is why our final answer is Choice B: water.<n><n><n>Input:If my clothes keep me warm, what am I wearing? Choices: 	A: sweatshirt	B: hat	C: shirt	D: gloves	E: hoodie <n>Output: 1 ) The question is asking where my clothes have to be for me to keep warm. 2 ) We then consider each of these choices. 3 ) Choice A: sweatshirt is probably the right one because we wear sweatshirt, and it is often warm. 4 ) Choice B: hoodie is probably incorrect because we don't wear hoodies to be warm usually, because it hides our ears and we cannot hear. 5 ) Choice D: gloves is incorrect because gloves usually only make us cold. 6 ) Choice C: shirt is wrong as well, because although shirts might be warm, they are usually worn in summer season, so they are not the right answer. 7) Choice E: hat is not the right answer because there are many hat types, and not all of them will be warm depending on the size of ear flaps and other factors. 8) Therefore our final choice is "B"— hoodie.<n><n>Input:If you don't speak to anyone, who are you talking to?

Here are some examples of how each phrase could be interpreted:<n>3) Example A: If Mary came off as cold, it would mean that she appeared to be distant or reserved. This would likely be due to her lack of familiarity with James and her reluctance to talk to him.<n>4) Example B: If Mary came off unfamiliar, it would suggest that she appeared to be uncomfortable or unsure of herself around James.<n>5) Example C: If Mary came off unknown, it would suggest that her identity or status was unclear or uncertain.<n>6) Example D: If Mary came off shy, it would suggest that there was an inhibition or hesitancy in communicating with James.<n>7) Example E: If Mary came off simply as shy, it would merely indicate that she was quieter or more reserved than usual.<n>8) To summarize, "Mary was not familiar with James, so spoke to him with a cold and unacquainted demeanor, which may have come off as shy or uncertain."<n>After analyzing these possible meanings, it seems more likely that Mary came off shy or uncertain.<n><n>Input:How many children will John and Jill have after their marriage?

Choices:  A: slender B: free flowing C: sparse D: unacquainted E: diet<n>Output:		1 and 3. The question is asking what might someone want to be  if he or she is "thick"?<n>2. We then examine each of the meanings of the words "thick" to understand what the question might mean.<n>3. OptionA: slender. As "thick" is the opposite of "slender", someone trying to be slender may want to be slender instead of thick.<n>4. OptionB: free flowing. As "thick" can refer to flow in a river, a person who wants to avoid a situation like flowing water may want to avoid becoming "thick".<n>5. OptionC: sparse. As "spare" is a synonym for "sparse", someone who wants to become "sparse" may also want to avoid becoming "thin".<n>6. OptionD: unacquaint. As the definition of "acquaintance" include "friendship", avoiding becoming "acquainted" may be a goal for someone seeking friendship, thereby avoiding becoming "thin". However, the question is about being "thick" rather than "acquainted", so this shouldn't be the correct answer.<n>7. OptionE: diet. As "diet" may be used to describe what one eats, someone may want to watch their diet so that they don't become "thick".<n>8. Option B: free flowing may be the most interesting answer to this question. By avoiding becoming free flowing, the person may also avoid becoming "thick". Therefore, option B, "free flowing", is the final answer.<n>Input: Do you say "Hi, there!" if it's night time?

Choices:  A: arrogate B: retain C: embrace D: smile E: engage<n>Output:		1: The question is asking about what Bill did to the enemy after he did not abandon the fight.<n>2: We then consider each of given options.<n>3: Option A: arrogate. This word means to have or show an offensive, demanding, or domineering attitude. This does not apply to Bill since he did not have that attitude toward his enemies.<n>4: Option B: retain. This means to keep something. This is a verb that makes sense in this context and is therefore the most likely choice.<n>5: Option C: embrace. This means to accept and protect. This is a verb which may fit in this context and is, therefore, a possible answer.<n>6: Option D: smile. Smiling may be an option, but we need context or further information to make an informed decision.<n>7: Option E: engage. Engaging is also an option but again it needs context to be an ideal answer.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where would you find people gathered near liquid in a workplace?

The answers that follow after the ones given are meant to provide more context and examples rather than new options for the question to ask. (B) Opera (E) Beach<n>2. Based on the answers given, we would look in places where people would gather: (A) Water cooler, (E) Beach<n>3. To find out whether or not there are people at these places, you may consider (A) Hospital where people, either patients or staff, would be there (C) Hockey Game where people gather to watch an entertainment or competition (E) Beach where people, either tourists or locals, would be there. <n>4. You would not find people gathered around a water fountain or even at an opera house.<n>5. After considering all the answers and the information stated above, Option A with Hospital as the answer makes the most sense based on the given options.<n>So the final  answer is A: hospital<n>

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: open meadow B: arctic tundra C: beach D: great outdoors E: england<n>Output:		1 A) "Open meadow" implies that the fox is in a forest somewhere because you can't hunt a fox in the open, so A is correct.<n>2 B) "Arctic tundra" indicates no trees which means you can't hound a fox with dogs because they won't be able to chase a fox. Dogs might be able to hunt a fox at night but it will require an artificial moonlight device to do so.<n>3 C) Beach is an acceptable answer, but it does not indicate that the fox is hunting.<n>4 D) For a fox to be hunting they need to have an opportunity to kill. It's generally considered unethical to allow one to escape. "A great outdoors" doesn't give a fox an opportunity to kill but it does offer a chance to hunt a foxe if a hound is present which is why B is incorrect.<n>5 E) For the final question the answer is, "E. England" because foxes only reside in England.<n><n>### Input: Where could you find the maximum entropy when viewing a flipchart?<n>  Choices: A: office B: bedroom C: conference room D: storage area E: cubicle<n>  Output: 1.

Choices:  A: backpack B: dog show C: chinese food D: french E: good hands<n>Output:		1)The joke is stating that eating a dog is considered bad manners in other cultures, which makes it difficult to answer the question because it depends on individual viewpoints regarding the appropriateness of the situation. 2)Even though it is a joke, the person is serious about eating dogs. Therefore, the context of the question must be considered when answering. 3)Option A: backpack. It does not make sense to eat small dogs because it would be impractical and unsavoury to carry them around in<n>backpacks. 4)Option B: dog show. The dog show context suggests that the person would eat dogs as part of the show, which is not an appropriate setting since it can cause harm to the dog. 5)Option D: chinese food. This option poses the only logical solution as dogs are commonly used as ingredients in Chinese cuisine, but this still doesn't consider the cultural appropriateness. 6. Option E: good hands. This answer is not supported by the information given and is therefore inappropriate. 7)Option<n>C: french food. As French cuisine is considered a cultural tradition in France, they are believed to appreciate using dogs as ingredients in their menus, making this the most appropriate answer. 8)From the information given, it can be concluded that French cuisine is the most appropriate answer to the question because it is considered acceptable in their culture.

This is an ambiguous phrase. It doesn't really make sense to say that the boys will do what they enjoy tonight, because if two or more people are doing<n>something, they can do it together and not necessarily individually.<n><n>4)Option B: get laid. The question is not specific enough to make it clear whether it is referring to actual sexual intercourse with another person or simply engaging in casual<n>flirtations and sexual activities. Since it's not clear what it means in this context, this option cannot be ruled out.<n><n>5)Option C: enjoyable. There are no two words in this phrase, therefore this is not an option that could be a correct choice. It would either take an adjective before the<n>noun, or be made plural by putting “enjoyables” in place of “enjoyable.”<n><n>6)Option D: work less. Work less is plural, so it cannot be an option.<n><n>7)Option E: enjoy living. It doesn't make sense to say that we can enjoy living or enjoying living.

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What is a lover likely to want to do with their partner? Choices:  A: build family together B: fall in love C: make love D: complete E: distance themselves<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what a lover is likely to want to do.<n>2) In choosing an answer, we consider each option individually.<n>3) Option A: build family together.<n>4)  Building family together means that a lover and their partner would likely be involved in caring for and raising children together. So, we can exclude this option.<n>5) Option B: fall in love.<n>6) Falling in love as a lover and their significant other would likely mean that the lover and their significant partner would spend time together, getting to know each other and bonding.  This means that the lover and there significant other would probably be in close proximity to each other, which doesn't necessarily include "doing" each other sexually.<n>7)<n>Option C: make love.<n>8)<n>This option describes a possible love-making act between a lover of their significant other.<n>9)<n>Option D: complete.<n>10)<n>completing something involves a high degree of effort and may be more applicable to something other than making love, such as finishing a project or an athletic event.<n>11)<n>Option E: distance themselves.<n>12)<n>This option implies that the lovers would likely distance themselves from one another.<n><n>12.

By using those tools, the officer can direct traffic to an alternate route or to a place where they can move smoothly along the roads.<n>5. Since such a traffic diversion is necessary to ensure public safety and to provide a quick exit for motorists, a proper way to achieve this is with directives.<n>In other words, we can say that the best choice to solve the problem is C: direct traffic.<n><n>Input: Why do thunderstorms take place? Choices: 1) when the atmospheric pressure increases 2) when it becomes dry when a storm is 3) during an earthquake 4) the temperature falls in an area 5) when the sun has finished setting<n>Output: 1) In order for thunderstorms to occur, it is required that certain conditions be met. One of such conditions which must first be met before thunderstorms can come about is atmospheric pressure.<n>Pressure, a measure of the density of air, is directly connected with the air temperature of a volume of air.<n>2) Atmospheric pressure causes raindrops in clouds to collapse together, forming drops which become heavy enough to fall and spread a rainshower or other type of precipitation.<n>3) Another way in which atmospheric pressure can impact thunderstorm formation is as an air disturbance that disrupts the rain formation mechanism.<n>4) Temperatures lowering at airplane altitudes (around areas where a thunderstorm can be formed) allow for this rain cloud formation, and air temperature decreasing over a certain area can form a thunderstorm.<n>If temperature increases above the usual, a hurricane is born.<n>5) When day turns to night, certain light radiation is bounced back, forming a lighting effect, which is why thunderstorms occur during dusk.<n><n>Input: A woman whose legs go round in a circle on the stage called them "the" Choices: 1: legs of the lady the 2: lady's legs 3: the lady's legs four

It does not specify whether the man is using a sharp object or not, but if he is, then it is not hard to see how he can injure himself with 3 hours of self-grooming each morning.<n>4. Option D: vacation. The question talks about grooming and does not mention anything about work. A 3-hour every morning grooming routine has nothing to do with being at work. Vacation would be the last thing on anyone's mind if they were grooming for 3 hours each morning.<n>5. Option E: neatness. There is no mention of any kind of neatness in the question. Even if the man takes 3 hours every Morning for grooming, it doesn't mean he will become neat. He may use all 3 hours to trim his beard, for example, which would not make him any neater.<n>6. Option C: injury is the best solution we can come up with. It is the most likely result of the man taking 3 hours of grooming every morning because it will inevitably lead to some kind of injury at some point.<n>7. After considering all the given options.

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

We then go through each of the answer choices and evaluate:<n>3. Option A - play. To be on the silver screen doesn't necessarily mean they can act in plays as they may be doing movie or television acting as well.<n>4. Option C- theater. An actor (singer, dancer or comedian) can possibly appear in a theater production also.<n>5. Option D- screen. All the other options don't really describe where the silver screen is found; it's more of a descriptive feature/category of it.<n>6. Option B - movie. Based on the context of the question, an actor can only be one of these: singer, dancer, comedian, or actor. So by definition, "actors" will most probably be in movies.<n>7. Option B - movie is the correct answer<n>

So to be a part of your home you need to be located in your home and nowhere in the world.<n>2.)If you go around your state, you will always be located in your state. So to be a full part of you home you need to be in your home, but not around your state<n>3.)If you can't leave the state, you can not leave your home, for you do not have any location outside of your home.<n>4.)If you go around you country, you might end up leaving the country. So to be a complete part of your home you have to stay in your country and not travel more than the country.<n>5.)To be in your home, you need to be less than 5000km away from it. In order to be a full part, you need to stay within your country, which puts on a range of 3000km<n>6.)To be a full part of home, you first have to be within your country, because outside would be travelling around. So if your home is within a state, you have to go around the state, which put the limit to 2000, making only 1000 for your state that is within your country<n>

What might she be a member of? Choices:  A: assisted living facility B: old people's home C: high school or college D: republican party E: organization<n>Output:		If Sally is a member of the House, and a senior, then she's probably a member of some seniors clubs that may or may not have a house of their own.  This could include  a fraternal organization (such as a Mason)  or an older version of a country club.  <n>A: She wouldn't be a member of an assisted living facility because those are facilities that people  live in, not clubs that they belong to.<n>     B: She wouldn't belong to an old people's home unless she'd made out very well in her career.  This is only a guess, of course, and she could be one of the founders of the organization rather than a member.<n>     C: She could belong to any of these organizations if they existed in her area.<n>     D: This is an organization, not a place, so she wouldn't be a senior in the Republican Party.<n>     E: This organization (or group) could simply be a club or group people get together for activities.  It doesn't sound as if you're specifying membership, specifically because everyone in the club would be seniors. <n>        <n>In conclusion, based on the description, I believe that the answer is C: any of them.<n>

Choices:  A: feeling refreshed B: becoming tired C: restlessness D: leg cramps E: sweating<n>Output:		1: The question is asking what happens when you take a hot in a shower after going on a run.<n>2: We consider each of the given choices, and we can eliminate three options right away:<n>3: Option A: feeling refreshed. We know that taking a shower is not enough to feel refreshed after going for a run.<n>4: Option B: becoming tired. Running is a form of exercise, and taking a shower after an exercise session can cause you to feel tired.<n>5: Option C: restlessness. There's no evidence to suggest that taking a shower could cause restlessness.<n>6: Option D: leg cramps. Leg cramps are a type of muscle spasm, and taking a hot shower can help ease the pain.<n>7: Option E: sweating. Taking a hot shower can make you sweat more and cause your body to heat up, so it would have no effect on whether you sweat or not.<n>8: After considering all the possible answers, we know that the only option that accurately answers the question is option D: leg cramps<n>So the final answer here is Option D!<n><n>## In this example the question is 3 but the output is 1<n><n>Input: What happens to a spider when it is in contact with a fly?

We then see the correct answer and the wrong answer<n>3. Option A - critical thinking. You should not give critical thinking as it is a wrong answer<n>4. Option B - congratulate: There is an assumption here that the person is applying for a job, and that they are not already employed. Therefore, even though there may be a wide variety of skills required for a job, only some of these may be relevant to the person's current occupation. If the person is already employed, then there is no need to congratulate them; this answer assumes the person is applying for the job of their choice rather than seeking more opportunities for personal development. It is also unlikely that people already employed would be applying for the job of any background.<n>5.

Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where would you stand in a line and need a coat if it is cold? Choices:  A: graph B: bank at noon C: good book D: post office E: bus stop<n>Output:		1. The question is looking for your best bet if you need a coat.<n>2. The other possible options are:<n>3. Option A, graph. At some point, your turn in line will come up. Unfortunately, you will be too cold to care about graphs.<n>4. Option C, your good book. You may try to read it to warm up since it's a good book. However, because your head is bent over the book, you may miss your bus.<n>5. Option D, post office. A long line to mail a letter can get you in touch with other people. This could help keep you warm.<n>6. Option A, "graph" is the only option where a line would be a good place to stand.<n>So there is no clear answer to this situation since all the other options will not warm you up enough for you to avoid catching a bus.<n><n>Input: If you left your room without turning off the light.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

Choices:  A: park B: motel C: corner D: bus stop E: store front<n>Output:		1. The question asks us where we typically find a trashcan in the city.<n>2. Option A: park. If you visited a park, you might also see a trashcan as they are often found in parks to encourage proper trash disposal.<n>3. Option B: motel. Motels typically have trashcan in every room, as the rooms are often used for short stays only, and the guests do not have much time to wait for the cleaners to pick up their trash.<n>4. Option C:corner. There is the strong possibility of finding a trashcan at a busy intersection or in areas with heavy foot traffic.<n>5. Option D:bus stop. There is some evidence to suggest that bus stops may have trashcans as there is likely to be some food trash left behind by passengers on the bus.<n>6. Option E: store front. Small stores typically have trashcans at the front of the store for the convenience of residents and visitors.<n>7. There is no evidence that bus stops or storefronts are exclusively places that you can find trashcans, although there is an increased likelihood of finding them there. <n>8. Conclusively, we would say that a trashcan can be found in a park, motel, at the corner, or a bus stop. However, it is unlikely to be found at a storefront. <n><n><n>### 1) A) The question is asking where "you" could find some plumbings that would not be of any use to you if you were thirsty.<n><n>### 2)A) It is likely to find water fountains at various public places that are accessible on the road, as it provides a convenient way for residents and visitors to have easy access to clean drinking water.<n><n>### D) It is not necessary to provide an explanation in this type of question.<n><n><n>## 31<n><n>Input: In this question the text to be read is the complete question: "What would you put an apple into" Choices: A: basket B: box C: pork chop D: can<n>Output: Answer: A: basket<n>1.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:John loves animals and he hates animal abuse.  Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n>Output:		1/ The question is asking where John might avoid going, given that he is careful about the places he visits because he likes animals and hates animal abuse<n><n>2. Options A, B, and E are places where animals are likely to be abused, so we can rule those out.<n><n>3. Option B, the parking lot, is likely to involve animal abuse because in a parking lot, cars are likely to involve crash tests with animals, and most parking lots involve construction involved in building a parking lot or repairing an existing one, which may include using wild animals or animals that have not been sterilized.<n><n>4. Option D, North America, is only a continent, not a place. So, it is likely to not involve animal abuse.<n><n>5. Option C, the woodland, is a likely place for animal abuse, as there are likely forests that are involved in lumbering. The use of animals to get firewood or to catch small animals in the forest is likely, but we can't state with certainty that the use of animals happens. So we can't completely rule that out.<n><n>6. We are left with option A, pet store, and option E, park. The use of animals in pet stores may be used to test the effectiveness of toxins on animals or it may be used in training. This could be a place where animal abuse is common, but once again we can't state that it's definitely going on.<n><n>7. It's likely that there may be places where animal abuse does not go on, and that's the reason why we have to consider all the options.<n><n>8. Given the possible occurrences of animal abuse in each option, there is a final option, E, park.<n><n>Final answer: Option E: park<n><n>Input:Who will clean the kitchen? Choices:  a: man b: child c: cleaning staff d: women e: mother <n>Output:1: "a" is the correct answer. Given the provided options, a man ("a") will most likely be doing the cleaning. <n><n>

Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

This choice is out-of-scope since you are asking what to tell Ali to do, not yourself.<n>4: Option B: "slow down":. This option implies that Ali may not be walking properly.<n>5: Option C: "wear shoes":. This option could be used since not wearing shoes could easily result in a bump.<n>6: Option D: "sell products":. This implies that Ali is selling something that you could buy, and hence the option not relevant to this question.<n>7: Option E: "speed up":. This option implies Ali is walking slowly, which could cause a bump.<n>8: Based on the above options, it is clear to me that option B, “slow down ", is the answer to this question since the options with high possibility of Ali getting a bump is B or C. So the final answer is B: slow down<n><n>Input:Where could you find some plundering that would not be of Use to you if you are hungary?

Choices:  A: carnival B: plane C: concert D: turned at night E: a penguin's bum<n>Output:		1: The question is asking what you would be looking at if you see blinking lights at night.<n>2. There are 5 possible answers to this question: A, B, C, D and E.<n>3. Answer A is incorrect because the word "carnival" includes amusement rides, parades, games, food on a stick and clowns. "Carnival" does not mean "flying saucers", "synchronized helicopter piloting", or other such phenomena of space-air interaction that may have blinking lights.<n>Also, there is no "carnival" that would take place at night.<n>4. Answer B is incorrect because the word plane refers to one kind of flying machine that is capable of air transportation.<n>According to this definition, seeing a "plane" during the night means that you see the illuminated parts of the "plane" which is not the "pilots seat" or the windows and thus your answer must be FALSE.<n><n>

A: article - “When is article used?”, “How many articles are there?”<n>3. Here, prepositions are different than articles. So the answer can be either option A or C, but the correct answer is A: article.<n><n>4. Article has the job of making the noun clear. For instance, In “I bought a chair.”<n>5. "When was it bought?”, “Is that a swivel chair?” can help to remove some doubt. However, if a preposition is used to introduce “of”, then it can be omitted as well.<n>6.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

Choices:  A: cinema B: opera C: party D: stage E: dance<n>Output:		1: The question is asking where we would see a performer at our friend’s gathering.<n>2: The options available for us to choose from are as follows:<n>3: Option A: Cinema. At an indoor cinema, which is in a large room, there will be a stage on which performers can be seen. This will not be the case in an outdoor cinema venue, as a stage would be infeasible.<n>4: Option B: An opera. At an opera, singers and dancers perform and this is considered a live performance.<n>5: Option C: Party. At a party, there are many rooms which can be set up with performance stages.<n>6: Option D: Stage. A stage is where a live performance takes place. It is commonly found as part of a theatrical production but can also be found outside of a theatre building.<n>7: Option E: Dance. It is not entirely clear what “dance” is referring to in this question, but if it is a reference to any kind of dancing (e.g., ballet, hip hop), then the “stage” would be a good place to see this take place.<n>8: After considering all the possibilities, it becomes clear that options A, B and C are the most likely solutions. This is because of the following reasons:<n><n>• An opera will typically feature live performers singing and dancing on a stage<n><n>• A party will usually have one or more rooms set aside for staging of performances.<n><n>• A stage itself is a natural place to find performers at a party or gathering!<n><n>9: Therefore, the final answer is A, B and C, or more explicitly, that we can see performers at a party in any room with a stage set up in it.<n><n><n>

Where did he drive? Choices:  A: great granddad's house B: family picture book C: brother's house D: family tree E: family reunion<n>Output:		1The question is asking where James drove his niece to.<n>2. James is a person in a "family tree" (source), which indicates that James drove to his family tree.<n>3. We must now consider every choice for the family tree.<n>4. Choice A : great granddad' house. It does not specify the direction that James is driving. If he were driving to the family tree, he wouldn't be going to the house of his great granddad.<n>5. Choice B: book of family pictures. A book of family pictures does not specify the direction James is driving. If the family tree he drove to is his, it means he drove to his family tree and not the book of family pictures.<n>6. Choice C: brother's place. Once again, it does not specify the direction to which James is driving. There is no reason to believe that James drove to his brother's place if the family tree he's driving to is the one he is related to.<n>7. Choice E: family reunion. This doesn't refer to a specific family reunion, so there is no contextual connection to James, and therefore there is no way to know if it's directed at the family tree James is heading into or something else.<n>8. Finally, when every choice for the family reunion is considered, the only one where James headed to his family tree is the option A: great granddads house.<n>So the final option is A: great granddau's place<n><n>Input: You know I just put 7,000 gallons of paint in the basement!

Choices:  A: carpeting B: magazines C: strip mall D: city E: applesauce<n>Output:		1- A: carpeting. While you can, in fact, buy carpet samples and sometimes even small pieces at a bookstore, none of those things qualify as a whole carpet purchase. You might not even be able to find a carpet sale at some bookstores if you're lucky.<n>2- B: magazines. Most bookstores sell a variety of magazines, some related to literature and some less so (think People, Us Weekly, etc.). These are not qualifying purchases in any significant way.<n>3- C: strip mall. If you want to buy a whole new apartment complex, mall, or subdivision, you should probably look elsewhere. But it is possible to buy an individual house or houseboat at a strip mall. Maybe. It depends on the area and on the availability of the property, but it's possible and a qualifying purchase.<n>4- D: city. City is a big word. It refers to an urban area comprised of people, housing, businesses, entertainment, etc. Buying one is not something you would likely do at a bookstore.<n>5- E: applesauces. If you want to re-invent yourself as the Applesauce King/Queen, it's possible to purchase applesauce samples in a bookstore. However, purchasing a whole new applesauce-making operation (city, houses, bookstores, etc.) is hardly going to happen.<n>6- After thinking through each of these possibilities, it's clear that option C is the only one that qualifies as a legitimate bookstore purchase.<n>So, the final answer is C: strip mall<n><n>Input:How do you stop water from evaporating? Choices:  Choices:  A- baking it B- pouring it on things C- adding salt D- adding sugar E- shaking it<n>Output: 1 - Evaporation is a natural process in which water molecules rise up in the atmosphere due to temperature and cause water to evaporate (disappear up into the air).

Choices:  A: get money B: pay money C: go shopping D: lose money E: save money<n>Output:		1) Some stores trick women to buy more products the sales make it seem if you buy more you get money.<n>2) There are many kinds fo trickery in the stores these days. One ploy that is particularly successful with women is the "limited supply" trick.<n>3) When the store manager sets a limited supply of the product on the shelves, it makes the product seem scarce and of greater value, so women are more likely to buy and get money.<n>4) If the store manager sells it at a lower price, not only will she get more money, but the store will also save money.<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>The question is asking where you would find some plumbing if you were thirsty. We'll look at each of the given choices in turn and see which choices are ruled out. Each of the choices is a valid answer by nature of the question. For example, we could not answer in some of the ways suggested below: 1) "There is plumbing in my kitchen". It is unclear whether this question is asking for an example of plumbing in a scenario where you are thirsty or for some explanation of what plumbing is. 2) "There is pluming in my home" <n>3) There are no words in the question that limit the choice to oil refineries.<n><n>1. There may be water available in an oil refineries, but it is not safe to use as it is likely contaminated. Therefore, we don't have a plumbing scenario as we can't drink the water. The answer choice is oil refineries.

Option D, a "path", is a structure that does not belong to the "woods".<n>4. Option E, a "forest", the whole forest will exist in the woods.<n>5. Option A, "a redhead", can be found in the woods only if it is a redhead tree. This is highly unlikely as the word "a redhead" does not make sense in this context.<n>6. Option B, "bear", is a forest animal, so it is likely to be found in the woods.<n>7. Option C, "a lake
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What is a child likely to do while going to play?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:where do you store wine? Choices:  A: attic B: basement C: art show D: church E: bar<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where we could store wine instead of the place were wine is stored which is the cellar or wine makers place.<n>2) We then consider each of given options.<n>3) Option A: attic. Since attic space is usually small and often hard to access, wine stored in attics is usually a smaller quantity that serves one family.<n>4) Option B: basement. Basements are often used to store a large quantity of wine. Large quantities of wine are stored so that the wines will age accordingly and become valuable in an appropriate time period. Since many people store wine in their basements, it is an option where wine could be stored.<n>5) Option C: art show. Wine is an excellent gift given at art shows. There are many wine labels (often referred to as art) that are given out at art shows. There is often wine at galas for museums and art exhibits where wine is served and stored during the exhibit.<n>6) Option D: church. Wine is served at many church events, such as communion in many churches who consider wine to be the blood of Jesus Christ. In churches where wine is served religiously, the wine could be stored on the church premises.<n>7) Option E: bar. Many bars serve a number of wines for patrons to enjoy. This is common at bars with more extravagant drink selections.<n>8) After considering all of the given options, it is clear to a reasonable degree of certainty that each of those options have wine being served, consumed, or stored in them.<n>9) So the final answer is B:basement<n>Input: What do you need to get around your block? Choices:  a: bus ticket b: car key c: drivers licence d: gifts e: keys f: walking shoes<n>Output: 1: The question is asking what you need to get around a blocked place and not what you can get from a place<n>2. Option A-Bus ticket and keys - Bus tickets are often sold in a box next to keys for people to get around block places.<n>3. Option B-Car keys and drivers license- A person would likely need a car key and driver's license to access a car, which can be a quick way to get around block places<n>4.

Choices:  A: cupboard B: cabinet C: own home D: everything E: garbage dump<n>Output:		1) A person with children might have many plastic things in their house. For example, kids toys, bags, plastic containers, cut food. 2) A cupboard is a small room or a box. It might be located in a kitchen where there is a lot of plastic stuff.<n>3) A cabinet is a storage place in the kitchen, bathroom, etc. There are many cabinets in many homes which contain plastic goods.<n>4) A person who lives in a house might have many plastic items in their own home, including toys, bags and cut food..<n>5) All the things and items that are not needed any longer might be thrown away to a garbage dump. But most likely, a garbage dump is no longer a dump, but a dumpster. It is a big trunk which is located outside and looks like a trash bin.<n>6) In conclusion only an option B (cupboard) is correct.

Choices:  A: efficiency B: getting work done C: marriage D: finishing up E: results<n>Output:		1: A bride and a groom taking care of proposals. This refers to a bachelor party and a bachelorette party<n>2: efficiency. Because these are not wedding day proposals, it seems unlikely that the bride and groom could care about efficiency.<n>3: getting work done. In the context, the suggestion of getting work done seems to make more sense, especially if marriage is the main goal.<n>4: marriage. This is the choice that makes the most sense. Taking care of proposals before the actual wedding indicates that there are still proposals to take care of.<n>5: finishing up. If it's not about the wedding, then it's highly unlikely that finishing up will be a consideration.<n>6: results. The fact that there is a ceremony to take is a result of something else.<n>Therefore, the final answer is C: marriage.<n><n>Input: a man is e-ticketed to ride the metro, when he gets to the station, he finds that the train is closed. His reaction was. Choices:  A : he is very angry B: the ticket is refunded C: he is relieved D: he gets a new ticket immediately E he goes to another station<n>Output: 1 The question says the ticket is e-ticket. In that case, there is no reason to be angry as the tickets are issued electronically and thus no one to blame for it.<n>2 The e-ticket also says that it is valid for a specific period or one can say it is a one-time ticket. In that case, why bother about refund? The issue here is that one has to check the validity of the e-ticket first to see if it is still valid.<n>3 There is no reason to be relieved as the metro is closed. There is another metro station, which may be open, but it is not clear whether he will be able to reach there and use it.<n>4 The metro may be open in other stations and as such he needs to get to another station where one is likely to find open metro station.<n>5 There is still no guarantee that he can complete this part of the journey and for that he will need to use another ticket.<n>Therefore, final answer is B: the ticket is  refunded.<n>

Option A: pocket. Pockets are a common place to store a blade for shaving. There are also razors designed to be worn in a pocket. Additionally, a pocket can be a more secure place to store a razor than the shower. Finally, razors can be stored in a pocket without anyone having to see them, making it more convenient for safety reasons.<n>3. Option B: shower. While one can shave in the shower, this is generally not done except as a last resort out of necessity.<n>4. Option C: chemist. A chemist is just like a drug-store, but more specialized.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What could you find at a bus station that can help you?

Choices:  A: roman architecture B: whitehouse C: spreadsheet D: bridge E: pantheon<n>Output:		1 The question is asking what you would use if you wanted to draw columns of numbers.<n>2 We consider the given choices:<n>3 Option A: roman architecture. Roman architecture is a style of architecture used by Romans. It uses columns and arches for support, so it wouldn't be the best choice for drawing columns of numbers because it doesn't use anything to draw lines between the columns.<n>4 Option B: whitehouse. A white house is a simple and easy design, making it less likely to be used for drawing columns of numbers.<n>5 Option C: spreadsheet. A spreadsheet is a computer application that can be used to display multiple columns of numbers in a matrix, making it the best choice for drawing a column of numbers.<n>6 Option D: bridge. A bridge is a structure used to cross from one place to another, and it wouldn't be suitable for drawing columns of numbers in this way.<n>7 Option E:pantheon. A pantheon is a temple or building used for worship, and it wouldn'thave much use for drawing columns of numbers (unless used for mathematics).<n>8 Therefore, the option that is least suitable for drawing columns of number is spreadsheet, which makes spreadsheet the appropriate answer.<n><n>Input: What will be able to be used for taking a bath?

Choices:  A: run B: swimming C: calculate things quickly D: fight enemy E: urinate<n>Output:		1.(The question is asking why someone would be wet after being full with fear.)<n>3. Option A (1.run):  We know that when we are scared or afraid, our heartbeat increases which can cause sweating. Therefore, being full of fear could make someone wet after they sweat.<n>5. Option B (2. swimming): <n>6. Option C (3. calculate things quickly):   After calculating quickly, you become less scared or afraid. Therefore, by being less afraid, it is unlikely to cause sweating and hence, no wetness will occur in this context. Moreover, if you were already wet previously, you cannot calculate anything quickly as you will be distracted by your own fear of drowning.<n>9. Option D (4. fight enemy):  If you are worried about an enemy coming and attacking, you would be scared. After getting scared and being full of fear, there would be a chance that a person would be wet. Hence, this option is also a possible answer to the question.<n>10. Option E (5. urinate):  According to many people, when they are scared, they feel the urge to pee. This is because the body tries to balance things that are out of balance (here, a sudden increase in adrenaline can increase your urinary frequency). Furthermore, the sudden release of urine can help you feel calm again. Therefore, it is a possible answer to why a person would be wet after they are scared or afraid.<n>So, when all options are considered, the correct answer is A: run because option C and E are not possible within the given context.  Answering Option E would be incorrect because option E may imply that the person was already wet, in which case they cannot do any “fast calculation”, which is asked in option C, before they were soaked again by being wet.<n><n>Input:Where could you find some plumbers?

According to Oxford Languages, the word “living” means: Having vitality, energy or spirit.<n>2. A living being is one that has life — it is not limited to a certain place or environment.<n>3. Large trees generally die when they are hundreds of years old. This is because they run out of nutrients that they need to continue living or growing.<n>4. However, the largest living tree is the General Sherman Tree, which grows in California. According to the USDA Forest Service, the largest living tree has a diameter that measures 1,486 feet (453 meters) (https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/sequoia/news-events/calendar-344650 ).<n>5.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What would cause someone to use invitro for reproducing? Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n>Output:		1,2 and 3. These are all true<n>4. Option A: problems. This choice is selected from the other choices to highlight the specific reason for invitro.<n>5. Option B: offspring. Invitro is a specific treatment for reproduction and is used as a means for a couple to conceive a child. It is not a treatment for offspring as such.<n>6, Option C: overpopulation. Invitro is more commonly used for reproduction in cases where the couple is unable to conceive naturally. This is one of the many reasons to use invitro in reproduction. 7. Option D: larger family. Invitro fertilization is increasingly being used for couples who want multiple children. It is not necessarily related to the increasing size of the family, but it does contribute to giving rise to families with larger numbers of children.<n>8. Option E:baby. Since invitro is used when there are problems with conception, it is natural that the baby is created using invitro. Invitro fertilation means the combination of eggs and sperm to produce an embryo. The embryo is placed in the womb of the female and it continues to grow into a baby.<n>9. Therefore, the correct answer is B: overpopulation.

The janitor may use the same bucket for cleaning, emptying the dustbins, mopping, bathroom cleaning, garbage cleaning, etc.<n>2. This depends on the janitor's job.<n>3. Option B: kitchen. In most kitchens, you will find buckets that are used to empty trash. In the case of hotels, these buckets will generally have the hotel's name printed on them and are collected from specific rooms. Therefore, it may be possible to identify which person was staying where from the bucket.<n>4. Option C: hardware store. Most hardware stores will have a large variety of buckets and cans. These items are purchased for various purposes, including for cleaning the yard.<n>5. Option D: garage. Garages are built to store cars.

We can also buy pens in our classrooms, B: pocket, at our friends' houses, D: office supply store, or E: classroom, respectively.<n>3: Option B: pocket doesn't mention anything about buying. This tells us that we don't necessarily have to purchase from pockets. However, to rule out the option completely, we can consider whether we can write down information in our pockets, and it turns out that there are no pens in our pockets.<n>4: Option C: friend's houses, doesn't necessarily mean purchasing. We can ask the owner to give us a pen or write down information on any piece of paper. However, in this case, we can't confirm that pens are available at friends' houses.<n>5: Option D: office supply store doesn't have to provide pens, as there can be many other things available there. However, this tells us that a store can sell pens. This rule is then reapplied to option E: classroom, where pens are sold.<n>6: After considering all the options and eliminations, option D: office supply store and E: classroom are left, and it turns out office supply store and classroom both sell pens. As both of them are true, only the first option can be the correct answer. Thus, the correct answer is option D: office supply stores.<n>Input: What am I?

Where might his connection be? Choices:  A: company B: airport C: wall D: computer network E: love<n>Output:		1- The word "connection" in the sentence refers to a relationship or contact between people, and not to a pipe or tube that connects two or more things.<n>2- It was also specified that James was delayed as he had a "connection". So we know he didn't have a relationship or contact with someone, but we're still not sure what he had.<n>3- Based on the other details in the question, it is clear that James had a delayed flight or a delay because his plane had to land at an airport. Therefore, his connection in this context could mean an airport or a flight.<n>4- As a result, the only choice that could be the answer, is option B: airport<n>5- We cannot conclude that James was delayed because he had a business meeting.<n><n>Input: What would someone need who was thirsty? Choice: A: water B: plumbing C: water bottle D: air<n>Output: 1: The question doesn't provide any context to decide where we might find water in different locations.<n>2: Therefore, the question is not asking where the answer might be, but rather, which of the given choices are examples of answers the question is looking for.<n>3: We can conclude that the answer could be anything related to water, since all of the options given are examples.<n>4: Based on the fact that water bottles contain water, it is clear that they contain other things.

Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n>Output:		1-You have been asked to select an image of some people standing on a long line near a road. If the road and/or the people are far away, the details of the scene will appear smudged or even non-existent.<n>2-The choice of roadside activity is significant in determining the answer. A bus stop or water fountain are suitable locations for long-term observations of small numbers of people. A military base, for example, might have a gate through which all visitors are restricted or an airfield where only people with a military purpose are present. This could result in a scene of many vehicles and/or high numbers of people in such locations.<n>3-Detailed observations of an apartment building would require more than a snapshot from across the street. The apartment building is only appropriate if there's a reason the camera is observing it rather than another building.<n>4-A fire house presents many vehicles that would be best captured with a wide-angled view. It is suitable for small-scale detailed observations. Large numbers of people might be gathered at a fire station, but it would depend on the specific activity.<n>As a result, the most likely option is C: apartment, and the least likely of the other options is D: fire house.<n>

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If a student was about to graduate, they would no longer be attending what? Choices:  A: library B: parties C: kindergarten class D: bar E: school<n>Output:		1.) The question is asking what the students would would no longer be attanding.<n>2.) Option A: library<n>3.) In a student's life, their experiences in a library have a much bigger impact because a library is where they do research and writing projects. If they are about to graduate, their days of going to school and interacting with their teachers are probably over, but they might still go to the library once or twice a year and use it for reference and research purposes. So the library is the only answer that would still make sense after they graduate.<n>4.) Option B: parties<n>5.) While it is true that there are parties and events that take place in a college or a high school, these generally have to be planned months in advance. A student is rarely going to have a party the night before graduation, and once they graduate, the events of a school or college's social scene are not relevant anymore.<n>6.) Option C: kindergarten<n>7.) A kindergarten student may attend a playground and go to the park regularly. However, once a student has moved above kindergarten or lower grade levels, the school playground becomes less of a priority and the park is rarely where they get their exercise/outdoor activities.<n>8.) Option D: bar<n>9.) A bar is a place you go to if you're 21 years of age and older. Once you graduate, this is not applicable anymore and therefore not the correct answer.<n>10.) Option E: school<n>11.) Once you graduate, you don't go to school anymore unless you have to for some work-related reason or to take a course.<n>12.) So, the final answer should be school.<n><n>Input: What does 31/8 have in common with 13/4 and why? Choices: 1st. The three numbers are all fractions. 2.

It can better be described as what? Choices:  A: field B: alone C: small group D: solitude E: solitary<n>Output:		1:The word "Crowd" may refer to a whole gathering of people or simply be referring to a big number of people.<n>2: Even though the crowd may not have been large, it can be described as a "big crowd" which is not inconsistent with a "crowd".<n>3: There may also be a number of people who are separated from the crowd, such as those who are not present in the area or those who are in a different room, hallway, or building. This group of people could be better described as a "small group".<n>4: The word "solitude" implies that one person or a small group of people are not connected with or separate from the main group; they are alone.<n>5: The word "solitary" implies that one person is not connected with or separate in any way to all other people, he/she is alone.<n>6: If the word "large" alone doesn't make it a field, then using the word "small" alone doesn't necessarily rule out a field since the definition of "field" is a large area of cultivated ground, not necessarily a field in the sense of agriculture.

If the soiled clothing cannot be washed, then it needs to be removed from the washing machine and checked for odor. If the clothes are too smelly,  it may be best to discard them as they cannot be washed and may never smell the same as they did when new.<n>4. Option C: get dirty. If the clothes have been soiled by grease or dirt, they should be removed from the washer and washed separately to maintain their cleanliness and prevent damage to the washing machine.<n>5. Option D: become soiled. There's no need to wash the clothes again if they already smell bad and are soiled. Simply hang them in the closet and they will air out naturally.<n>6. Option E: air out.

It is also not possible for lack of intelligence to lead to an inablity to learn.<n>4: Option B: education: this is incorrect because lack of education is not directly related to inability to learn.<n>5: Option D: distress: If someone cannot learn, it can lead to distress and anxiety - however, this does not mean that distress causes the inability to learn. For example, if someone is illiterate, they may find reading difficult leading to disatss, but this is not the same as saying that the disatss caused the inablity to learn, rather that the disatss is a result of inablity to learn and has no direct cause and effect.<n>6 Option E: a stupid: this is incorrect because the question specifically said that there is a negative impact rather than just saying that we are idiots if we cannot learn.<n>7. So, a stupid question like option E: a stupid, is wrong<n>8. The correct answer is A: intelligence<n><n>Input: Which of the following could be used to make a chocolate malt: the option are: milk, malty, malt, salt, sugar<n>Output:1.

Choices:  Gas with the best reviews  A: Get a map that shows the best gas stations  B: Buy a gas guide book C: Look at gas prices the week before and pick the one with the lowest price D: Look up the cheapest gas in your area  You can’t go wrong when buying a gas guidebook  E: Go directly to the gas station with the lowest price<n>Output: 1 / In terms of a gas guidebook, you will find a variety of reviews. If you read a number of them and trust your judgment, you will be able to choose which station is most likely (“likely”) to have the cheapest gas. You just need to compare the average reviews (or average ratings) for each station with the price of gas at each station. In case of a gas guidebook and reviews,  "most likely" is the answer given by the author. <n>2 /  In terms of gas prices, looking up the cheapest gas station in your area is the best way to do it. This way you’ll know who’s the least expensive station, even if that station’s prices change during the week. The cheapest gas station may not necessarily be the one that’s in the city center—it's more likely to be one out of the way. Buying a gas guidebook helps you to see the prices of all the gas stations in the area. So you could choose the station you like.<n>3 / In terms of a map that shows the cheapest gas stations, this is the most popular option when looking for the cheapest gas. However, it’s very difficult to find one. So, gas guidebook is the best option.<n>4 / In terms of an online map that shows

Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		1.The question is asking where you can find a movie theater and other stores in one place.<n>2. We can see that all the given options are places that are either downtown or urban, but may or may not contain stores.<n>3.Option A: downtown areas. Downtown areas usually contain a mixture of residential, retail, and office buildings, making it somewhat common to find movie theaters and stores there.<n>4.Option B: urban areas. A city or town with urban areas is likely to contain movie theaters and stores. There are other businesses mixed in with stores and theaters downtown areas which may be present in an urban area.<n>5.Option C: New York City. Along with New York City, another option is Chicago, which has many movie theaters and stores downtown. All of these places are urban areas and likely to contain the combination of movie theaters and stores that is being sought.<n>6.Option D: Shopping mall. The given options do not mention any shopping mall, but for the sake of argument, let's consider all the shopping malls. While shopping malls do contain stores, it's possible to use more specific options for convenience such as Walgreens, Office Depot, or Apple Store.<n>7.Option E: Military base. A movie theater is not likely to be found at a military base, but other stores may<n>be there.<n>8.After considering all the options, downtown area, urban area, New York City, and shopping mall are probably the best choices, but they do not explicitly mention where stores may be found alongside movie theaters, so downtown area and urban area should probably be ruled out.<n>9.Option A: dowtown area:  Movie theaters and stores can be found downtown, but they may not be directly next to oneanother. Also, some buildings in downtown areas contain movie theaters and other stores at the same time. However, a downtown area is unlikely to have stores within a movie theater's building and if it does, movie theaters are not likely to be included.<n>10.The movie theaters are unlikely to be directly next to stores and stores are unlikely to be in the same building where you could find a movie theater.

Therefore, the phrase "on the mountain" means "on the mountain roads" in the context of a trucker.<n>3. We can conclude  that the sentence "He is as good at driving a car on a truck, as he is on the mountain" means "He is as good as he is at driving a car on the mountain's roads."<n>4.

We need to consider each of the given answers<n>3. Option A. We would not put grapes in our mouth before checking out.<n>4. Option E: Fruited market. This is logical given the question. We would just put grapes next to the food we are shopping.<n>5. Option B: Grocery Cart. Again, if the question was "where do you put you grapes just before shopping at the grocery store", then the only logical answer would be to put your grapes in the GROCERY CART.<n>6. Option C: Super Market. This answer is not only illogical, but it also makes no sense. Even if we put fruit in the grocery cart and checked out at the grocery cart, we have still not answered the question.<n>7. Option D: Fruit Basket. There are more things that can fit in a Grocery Cart than just fruit. For example, we could also put cereal and bread there. But a fruit basket does not allow us to keep cereal and any other items, thus the answer is incorrect.<n>8.

Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What could happen to a paper if you leave it outside even if it does not move? Choices:  A: one material often recycled B: ripped C: saturated with water D: one dimensional E: crumpled<n>Output:		1.“What could happen to a piece of paper if you leave it out even if it does notmove?”<n>2. The word “if” is telling us that the following scenarios are dependent on the condition for “if”. There are different kinds of papers and we need to consider these possibilities.<n>3. Option “A: one material often recycles” may answer to the question. In this condition, the paper could still be recycled and be used afterwards.<n>4. Option “B: ripped” could be the answer. In this situation, a paper could be ripped even by wind, so if the paper is left outside without moving, it could be ripped.<n>5. Option “C: saturated with the water” could also be the answer because of the condition, “even if it does not move”. In this condition, the rain or rain drops could saturate the paper. The paper will not move at the event of rain, but if the paper is left out, it could still get wet.<n>6. Option “D:one-dimensional” might not be an answer. A paper is normally not one-dimensional, but two-dimensional. Also, a paper that has been saturated with water cannot be considered one dimensional. Therefore, there should be a condition for “one-dimensional.” When the paper is left out even if it doesnotmove, it could be ripe if it remains wet on the outside.<n>7. Option “E:crumpled” is also not an answer as the word “crumpled” does not fit into the description of the question.<n><n>In summary, all the possible answers are A: one-material, often recycled, B:ripped and C:saturated with water, but we cannot choose any of these answers.<n><n>Thus, the correct answer is B: ripped.<n><n>Input:What is one reason a dog could be good if it is lost in a thick swamp?

Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What is required to be good at playing tennis? Choices:  A: tennis racket B: skill C: competition D: tennis court E: legs<n>Output:		1.'Playing tennis' implies both hitting balls with rackets and playing on a court.<n>2. 'What is required?' indicates that playing court is not one of the options<n>3. Option A. Tennis racket is essential to play it. You must have one if you need to play tennis.<n>4. Option C. Competition is not required to be good at tennis.<n>5. Option D. Tennis court is not required to be a good tennis player.<n>6. After considering all the above options, it is clear option A is the only one that can be good enough for you to play tennis.<n>So the final outcome is A: Tennis racket<n><n>Input: What must you use to use the stairs? Choices: 1. A: feet 2. B: head 3. C: hands 4. D: clothes E: legs<n>Output:#1: 1. The Question asks "What must you use to use stairs"<n>#2: 2. Stairs are a form of a ladder as stairs is a single step made to stand.<n>#3: 3. We can use our hands to use stairs. If we are handicap, we can use our wheelchair to use stair. But, there is no point in using clothes to use stairs.<n>#4: 4. We don't need legs to use stairs. Though it may seem strange, you could even use your head to use stairs if it fits the right condition.<n>#5: 5. After considering all the given options, it is obvious that neither A ('Feet'), nor B ('Head'), nor C ('Hands') can really be used to use stairs. But D ('Clothes') and E ('Legs') can be used to use stair, for example if you have a wheelchair, you could use it to use stairs. This would make Option D to be the correct answer.<n>#6: 6. So the final answer is D: Clothes<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A.  It's indicative of a health or sleep disorder like depression.  B.  It's sign that's not of use to you and may not even be true.  C.  It is likely to occur more than once if you're already seeing it in your sleep.  D.  It's a medical condition that's more common than most people think.  E.  You're in great danger. What could it signify in this context?<n>Output:  The question is actually a little bit tricky.<n>  It's asking the question after saying "indicates" which means that whatever it indicates is indeed true and not a figment of your imagination(as indicated in the last choice, "sign that's not of any use").<n>5 The question then goes on to ask, what does it indicate in this context.  The answer can't be "it's a sign that's more common" because this is not a specific context so this cannot be known.<n>6 The answer can't possibly be "that's not of any value or use to you" because this is again saying "no" when it can't be known.<n>7 The answer cannot be "a condition likely to occur" because a condition is not a single instance and this is a single instance which is likely caused due to some reason(and this is what the question is trying to find out).<n>8 The answer can't even be "more common than you think" because the context of this question is that it has already appeared in the subject's sleep without a specific reason.  It's not a common occurrence in the sense that any person can experience it.  It's common only if it's common to the subject in question.<n>  The only answer that can fit in this context is that it's a symptom of a medical condition.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: income tax B: satisfaction C: sorrow D: ocean E: bill collectors to happy<n>Output:		1."Getting paid" can refer to any number of scenarios, but in the question, we have to assume that it refers to receiving a paycheck.<n>2."Feel" is a vague word, so we cannot directly determine what the outcome of getting paid is without context.<n>3."Income tax" is a necessary evil that is required because the United States has a progressive tax system. We pay tax on our income to keep the federal government running.  That being said, no one enjoys paying income tax.<n>4."Satisfaction" is subjective and can mean many things, including getting paid. In fact, most people are satisfied with their pay.<n>5."Sorrow" is a general feeling of unhappiness, and while getting paid may be an overall good thing, not everyone is happy about it.<n>6."Ocean" is more of a joke answer that doesn't offer any real benefit to the word "feel".<n>7."Bill collectors" is a specific answer that has a negative connotation. Not everyone is happy receiving pay, specifically if they've been delinquent on their bills and are receiving calls and letters as a result.<n>8.It's clear that getting paid is a mixed bag and can cause feelings ranging from elation to despair. The most fitting answer would be a tie between satisfaction and sorrow.<n>So the final answers are D: ocean E:Both A and C B:satisfaction C: sorrow D:both A and C E:bill collectors To F:Satisfaction<n><n>Input:You need to take out the trash, but you are not allowed.

Choices:  A: trash can B: honey C: bouquet of flowers D: rose garden E: field of flowers<n>Output:		1. The question is posed is asking where bees congregate when visiting a red flower. 2. Options A and B are both correct since both contain red flowers. Option A lists the trash can as the first choice while option B lists honey as the first choice. Option C also fits the description since they are "congregating" with the flower and option D is a flower garden which would also be a likely choice for bees. The remaining options all describe a situation that would not be conducive to being around red flowers, making all of them incorrect answers to the question. <n>3. Answer B should be selected since the first answer is an incongruent red flower and a red honey that is unlikely ever visited by a bee. However some bee species will eat honey to supplement their diet of pollen, so this option is also correct. Answers E and C were eliminated due to their descriptions of a flower garden and a bouquet of flowers, respectively, and thus are not correct even though a bouquet of flowers could contain red flowers and a garden could have a red flower. This means that option A should be eliminated as well.<n><n><n>![](https://github.com/JinRyun/KickStarter_Homework/blob/master/01_input_output_example/000.jpg)<n><n>

In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

Choices:  A: wasteland B: ocean C: desert D: parking lot E: flowers<n>Output:		1) The first option that comes to mind is "a desert". However, this option is invalid because "a community garden" is not a "desert".<n>2. The "A" and the "B" options are grammatically incorrect and are therefore invalid.<n>3. The "C" and the "D" options are again incorrect.<n>4. The "E" option can be the final answer because "a community garden is a place where the citizens of a city or town can grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers."<n>5. Since the community is getting demolished, the answer must be an option that does not allow the community to thrive. Flower gardens support life. Even if it is a parking lot which does not produce anything, it would allow life to thrive better than a desert.<n>So the final Answer= E: flowers<n><n>input: "My mother has many potted plants. She waters them every morning." Choices: A: morning B: every morning C: all the time D: always E: all night long<n><n>Output: The question is asking what time "my mother waters the plants" from among the given options.<n><n>1. Option A, "morning", is an invalid word as it does not match a time of day.<n>2. Option B: every morning. This cannot be considered as the answer because you cannot use a plural form to describe a time of day; a time of day is a singular entity.<n>3. Option C: all the time. This is also not the final answer because, according to the question, my mother should only water the plants once.<n>4. Option D: always. This option is invalid because the question states that my mother waters the plants every morning, implying that she doesn't water the plants at any other time.<n>5. Option E: all night long. This option could also be the final answer.<n><n>input: I would like to make a pumpkin pie with homegrown pumpkins. Choices:  A. fresh B. freshest C. homemade D. homegrown<n>Output = "I would like to make a what?".<n>1. The answer is obviously " a pumpkin pie". But the word "a pumpkin pie" is not an option in the question. So we've to try and narrow the options down by eliminating them one by one.<n>

Choices:  A: good health B: finger C: meat D: body E: own family<n>Output:		1: The skin was cut while choipping onions<n>2: This is what the answer will be in this case:<n>3: We can not assume the context with which the question is asked in, so there may be cases where the answer may be either A, B, C or D - even E, but the only choice that can be guaranteed in this answer is "own family".<n>4: A: Good Health. In this case if the skin was cut while chooping onions, you will also be chopping your whole onions on your skin making the process of food preparation painful and will eventually affect your good health too.<n>5: B: Finger. In this case if you cut your finger while chopping onions - that is most probably not a pleasant experience<n>6: C: meat. In this case if your skin was cut while choping onions it will affect your meat negatively, thereby making it unfit for consumption.<n>7: D - "Body". In this case if the question was "where was your body cut while chopping onion" - then yes, there are higher chances that the skin on your body will take a bigger hit more than your body and health - though you can also say it can impact your health too - but it is your body that is getting cut first and the rest of your health is a concern here.<n>8: E: "own family". If the question was "where does your family get cut when they come in contact with onions" then you cannot possibly say that the answer to that is any of the above option as it does not make much sense. The only answer would be "own family" and this is why we have chosen it as the correct answer.<n><n>

Depressed: if you are depressed, you are often unable to work or perform even simple tasks due to a lack of motivation or feelings of hopelessness. Therefore, you may have a mental health illness rather than a physical illness.<n>b) Downcast: if you are downcast, you are usually struggling with low self-esteem or a sense of hopelessness. This again suggests that you may have a mental illness rather than a medical one.<n>c) Angry: if you are angry, you are experiencing negative emotions such as rage or frustration. While this can lead to physical symptoms such as heart palpitations and shortness of breath, it is not clear whether it is a physical illness or not.<n>d) Unhappy: if you are unhappy, you are feeling sad or dissatisfied with your life. While this can lead you to experience physical symptoms such as sleeplessness and anxiety, it is not a medical illness.<n>e) Gloomy: if you are gloomy, you are feeling sad, gloomy and pessimistic. This is a strong indication that you may be dealing with a mental health illness.<n>3) As a conclusion, it can be concluded that if you are not glad, unhappy or angry, you may be dealing with some mental health illness such as depression or anxiety, rather than a physical ill.<n><n>Input: What can two people do between being a tutor and having no time?

And the "wall" is not either. Both of them would not be John's hands. If we substitute "hands" for "hostility" and "wall" for "fist", we can see that the correct<n>answer is option C. John is not punching and pounding his hands on his nose or the wall, his bloodied eyes.<n>3. Option B: It's obvious that John could use his hands to punch at the wall if he is punching with both fists simultaneously. Because John will not be able to punch at the same time if he only "holds his fists".<n>This means that the correct answer is option D.John's fists.<n><n>Input:I am not just the smartest kid in the world, I am the smartest kid in every universe.

The father from another universe knows this, and it tells it.<n>"Take me to your leader". But this does not make sense because the smartest kid can not see the leader of the father of another universe, because the smartest kid (himself) can only see the father of this universe.<n>Therefore the correct answer is Option C<n>5.Option C:Use the mind control ability.

The water could splash in a river from a mountain, but there are lots of rocks and waterfalls making it hard to identify which one made the splash.<n>4) Choice B: ground. There is little to no elevation change between the river and the ground, so it would splash similarly as if someone simply threw a rock.<n>5) Choice C: bridge. The height of a bridge above the river would make the rock splash more dramatically.<n>6) Choice D: mountain range. Mountain ranges can be far away from the river or very tall, making the impact different from where a stone is thrown.<n>7) Choice E: surface of the earth.

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: terrible B: little C: halloween D: small E: horrible<n>Output:		1, The question is asking about the decorations that the boy did.<n>2. We consider each of the given choices.<n>3. Option D: small. While decorations can be small (meaning there isn't a lot of room to stand), they also can cover a large space. Therefore, option D is incorrect.<n>4. Option E: horrible. Horrible is an absolute value (it means "very bad"), and it cannot be used with a comparison clause. Therefore, the "horrible decorations" should be compared with something else rather than being absolute.<n>5. Option A: terrible. This is wrong because terrible can be a superlative (meaning "worse"), but the question is looking for a comparison clause, so a superlative is not allowed.<n>6. Option B: little. Little is an objective modifier (it is objective, not subjective, in other words, it does not imply an opinion). This is wrong as the question requires a subjective modifier, meaning an evaluation word based on opinion.<n>7. Option C: halloween. Halloween is the name of a holiday (and a name which implies horror). This is incorrect because a name of a type of holiday cannot be used in this manner.<n>8. Finally, it is clear that horrible decorations are exactly what the speaker described and should therefore be the best choice. Therefore, the final answer is E: horrible<n><n>Input:How many of your friends have a dog? Choices: 1.

Similarly, option B is incorrect as it uses an evaluation word such as too few.<n>4. Option D: 1. Option D, although an approximation of the correct answer, contains a number which is too high.<n>5. Option E: 5. The best answer is option E, not only because it uses the appropriate number of a few, but because it also uses the word exactly, which is the correct word to use in this context.<n>6. Therefore, the final outcome is E:
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What is done to wood to attach something to it? Choices:  A: nailed B: carved C: polished D: eat cake E: petrify<n>Output:		1:The question is asking what wood does to attach something to it.<n>2:Therefore, we need to find out what could be done to wood.<n>3:Wood could be used to make furniture, wooden floors, fireplaces and tables.<n>4:Nailed or carved are the most relevant options as they are both done to wood to attach or decorate it.<n>5:It doesn't seem possible to eat wood; therefore, it is likely that it won't be an option.<n>6:Similarly, petrify would also not seem to be a fit.<n>7. There are no other logical options but nailed and carved.<n>8. If we analyze "to serve", it has a connotation of acting in a certain manner.<n>9. Therefore, in the end, it is clear that it is about what could be done to attach something to it, therefore, it should be "nailed" and "carved". This is because there would not be anything else to consider.<n><n>Input: Is it true that a vase can also be a pot? Choices: A: False B: True C: Yes D: No E: It does not matter in this case<n>Output:1: The question is asking if a vase can also hold a pot.<n>2: Therefore, we have to look into if a vase can be or is a pot<n>3: As per the question, yes, a vase definitely can be a pot.<n>4: a pot can also mean "a typically earthenware vessel containing a botanical specimen". This makes "A false" an incorrect choice.<n>5: "A can also" implies that "A" does not necessarily have to be true, so in this context, "Can also" must be true.<n>6:"Does not matter in this case" makes no sense in this context, which makes it an incorrect choice.<n>7:"Yes" is possible but does not make sense in this context, so it is also not the correct answer.<n>8.The only way to interpret a vase as being able to be a pot is by the definition of "a typically earthware vessel". If a vase did not contain a botanical specimen, then it would not be a pot. Therefore, the only answer would be "B: True".

They were dating for a while and wanted to be together for even longer. For this reason, they did what? Choices:  A: make sex B: plan to marry C: dance D: electrical circuit E: row about<n>Output:		The question is asking what John and Jane did so that they would date for a longer period of time.<n><n>2. The first line indicates that John and Jane are a couple, suggesting they must already be dating.<n>3. The couple may have been dating because they wanted to spend more time together, but there may also have been another reason (e.g., their mutual desire to date).<n><n>4. The question assumes that the couple must do "something" in order to continue with their relationship. <n>5. We can consider each of the given answers in turn:<n>6. Option A: "make sex." This option implies that the couple may have engaged in sexual activities in order to continue their relationship. This option can be ruled out as it does not fit the context indicated by the question.<n><n>7. Option B: "plan to marry." This is the only other answer and may be a correct choice if we are simply told that the couple is planning to stay together. <n><n>8. Based on this, the answer could be B: plan to marry.

Choices: 1. goat 2. brick 3. Brie 4. crab 5. Parmesan<n>Output: 1) We should begin with a statement of fact that all the given options are indeed kind of cheese.<n>2) We cannot rule out answers crab cheese is not a kind of Brie, Parmesan is not a kind of blue cheese.<n>3) All the remaining options are all cheese, except option Parmesan, for which the statement "Parmesan is not a sort of cheese" would imply that Parmesan IS a kind of cheese. Thus, statement of fact can be used to eliminate Parmesan as an answer since Parmesan is indeed a sort of cheese.<n>4) The statement of fact "Parmesan is a sort of cheese", which means that fact is that Parmesan ISN'T A SORT OF CHEESE" can be used to eliminate cheese as an answer as there is no Parmesan. Thus, statement of facts may be used to eliminate cheeses as an option as Parmesan has no statement of facts at all.<n>5) 3 remaining options are indeed different kinds of cheese. Thus the final answer will be 5) Parmesan<n>

A front door is unlikely to contain an inkwell as such items tend to be found on other types of furniture.<n>4- Option B: bedroom. While bedrooms are certainly possible locations for an inkwell, it would be unusual to find one in the bedroom. Such items are more commonly found in desks or other pieces of furniture which can be used for writing or drawing.<n>5- Option C: desk. This is a reasonable possibility as desks sometimes include inkwells, particularly older desks.<n>6- Option D: table. Many tables include inkwells as a feature, providing a convenient place to store ink for writing.<n>7- Option E: living room.

It is defined as someone who is trained in cooking, especially in the fine dining industry.<n>2: From what is defined above, a chef is someone who is trained in preparing food, not someone who eats it. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is B: study frenchcooking.<n>3: The remaining options are not suitable for the case. For example, option A: cook dinner may be considered a reasonable answer if we are not given enough information and background to know what time of day the question is asking about.<n>4: Similarly, option C: taste sauce and option D: prepare food can both be considered possible answers if they mean "to prepare food for the evening meal," but without more context, there is no way to know for certain what time of day the chef is working.<n>5: The only reasonable answer is choice B: study frenchcooking because it is a definition of what a chef does, and the correct answer must match the question being asked.<n>6: With this conclusion, the most reasonable answer must be choice C: thin sauce rather than E: tsin sauce which suggests that the question asked for food to eat during dinner which cannot be considered as a duty of a chef.<n><n>Input: If the letter "d" is replaced with "e" and the letter "c" is replaced with "b", how do the new letters spell?

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What could a balalaika be needed for? Choices:  A: artist junkyard B: music store C: singing D: symphony E: orchestra<n>Output:		1. This question is asking what a balalaika could be used for, not what it's made from.<n>2. Considering each of the given options:<n>3. Option A - artist's junkyard: since a balalaika is a form of stringed musical instrument, it could most certainly be used for making musical instruments.<n>4. Option. B - music store: we are not sure why this is here though- we don't know any music stores with "junk yards" in them.<n>5. Option. C - singing: Since a balalaika is used to make music rather than to sing, this is not the correct choice.<n>6. Option. D - symphony: the purpose of a symphony is to make music, thus it would not be necessary for a balalaika to be used for this purpose.<n>7. Option. E - Orchestra. An orchestra is a collection of musicians working together to play music, and a balalaika would be used to make music, but that does not mean it could only be used to play music. There are many other uses it could be used for.<n>8. After weighing all the options, it can be concluded that option C is the best answer, since a balalaika could never be used for singing or music making, and the symphony could have multiple purposes when making music.<n>So the final decision is C: singing.<n><n>Input: The name of which Greek deity is pronounced "oh-rah"? Choices:  A. Athena B. Hephaestus C. Poseidon D. Aphrodite E.

This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by only a few people recently? Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n>Output:		1) The question is asking about where you could find air that has been recently breathed by a few people.<n>2) Now let's consider each of the given choices.<n>3) Choice A: train station. Plane travel is faster since you're riding in a bird and the train has to cover long distances, hence trains offer cheaper travel. Although people usually talk and laugh during the journey, there are no open windows on the trains, so air does not circulate well. On the contrary, trains are well ventilated and air is circulated frequently. Therefore, the probability of having a recent human breath sample is quite higher at a train station than at an airport. Therefore it can be concluded that choice A, the train station, is probably the most preferable and plausible alternative.<n><n>4) Choice B: house. In any room of any house, you will find an adequate supply of purified air. Therefore, air conditioning makes indoor air better than outdoor air. In addition, air in the house will most likely be well-ventilated, so people in a house do not need to breathe. Therefore, the house is an unlikely option. So the final answer is A, the train station<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where would you find a sign with some people lined up next to it? Choices:  A: bus stop B: street corner C: roadblock D: fast food drive thru E: city<n>Output:		1, Choices A and B are acceptable but B is the "best" choice.<n>2, The question is asking where would you find a sign and people lined up next in line for the sign.<n>3, Choice A: bus stop. Although there is a bus stop which has signs lined with passengers waiting for it, it is not the sign that is the focus of the question.<n>4, Choice B: Street corner. A street corner may be accompanied by signs and a line of people waiting for those signs, but these signs would represent another sign which is not the focus of the question and is not what you are suppose to find.<n>5, Choice C: roadblock. If the focus of the question is the sign and not the line of people nor the purpose of the question, then a roadblock does not represent such a scenario.<n>6, Choice D: fast food drive-thru. People can line up for food from a fast food drive-thu, but it is not for the sign which is the focus of the statement.<n>7, Choice E: city. If you're asking where would you find people standing next to a sign, then you are thinking of a city because people are everywhere and you can find a sign almost everywhere as well.<n>8, We conclude that the correct answer is B: street corner for this specific question. However, it should be noted that each of the four remaining choices are acceptable answers for the specific version of the question.<n>

Choices:  A: court B: dinning room C: throne room D: monarchy E: castle<n>Output:		1: the question is asking where the king would meet an ambassador.<n>2: The king typically meets in a court with the council if not for business purposes. However, this is all speculation as there are no solid details.<n>3:The king has several other locations where he can meet the ambassador including a dinning room or his private living quarters.However, these are all not a good option as they are too small for such a meeting since the king would want to demonstrate his power and importance by meeting the ambassador in one of the grand halls.<n>4:The king only has public royal audience after certain major achievements which is not in the scope of this question, as per the question king only meets when asked for or in the court.The king also has no business of the court in the throne room as this would not be considered as a meeting by the king of councilors in his council hall, which again defeats the requirement of the question.<n>5:While the king may meet in the castle, this is normally reserved for personal reasons, such as privately meeting his sister or another relative that is not a member of the Royal Government or Council. Again, this is not a proper place for such an event as there is nothing special to the castle and the king could use the castle room for other purposes during the day when there were no important guests or state affairs to attend to.<n>6:All other options can be rejected as per the above answer.<n>7:The final answer is B: court.<n><n>Input: What is the probability of a car breaking down for every hour?

Choices:  A: compliments B: understand themselves C: life partner D: second chances E: larger house<n>Output:		1) You could get compliments if you are a new mother, although it may be biased towards more mature mothers who have more experience (which may mean the compliments are not honest).<n>2) You could understand yourself more if you are an older mother, but it may not be possible to completely understand yourself because your mind is constantly changing and it's a difficult task to achieve.<n>3) You could understand better your self if you are a new mom because you are just beginning to know yourself as a mother. However, even though you may understand yourself better with age, it may not be the case that you will understand your self completely, making this answer inaccurate.<n>4) You could get a life partner if you are an older mom. However, this doesn't necessarily mean you will get a second chance on being a young mother. In fact, some women who have older children but may remain young may choose to have more children as a way to escape the responsibility of caring for older children.<n>5) You could get a larger house if you are a mother with more children.<n>6) Your answer should not be "E" as it's just a matter of fact and is not relevant to the question at hand (which asks where does a person need to go in order)<n>

Choices:  A: pleasure B: accident C: get somewhere D: hurt E: falling down<n>Output:		10. The question is asking why riding bike through rough territory can be dangerous.<n>2. We can break down "through rough terrain can be dangerous" as "x could find themselves what."<n>3. We then consider each option to see what it fits into this sentence.<n>4. Option A: pleasure. It is possible, but much less likely, that someone could find themselves pleasure while riding a bike through rough terrain.<n>5. Option B: accident. One could certainly find themselves in an accident while riding a bi-cycle through rough territory since falling off the bike is a common occurrence.<n>6. Option C: get somewhere. It is possible to find yourself in a place you would not expect to be during a bike ride through rough territory because you might end up getting lost or tangled in vines and have to walk your bike.<n>7. Option D: hurt. Riding a bicycle can hurt you or leave you injured if you fall or crash into something and one could certainly find themselves injured in such a situation.<n>8.

We can split the second part of the question into a new question: "What are the reasons for keeping a cool head while in the heat of the"<n>3. We can then break down the answer to the new question as: "You find x for "It is important to keep a," as "A good reason to keep a cool head would be to remain calm and make the best decisions possible in your situation," or "A possible reason for keeping a cool head would be that it is more difficult to fight when one is afraid or angry"<n>4. We then consider each answer from the second question:<n>5. Option A: "A good reason to put on a hat is because it can keep your head warm in the cold." A good reason to keep a "cooly heads" would be to remain calm in a difficult situation because it might be easier

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n>Output:		1) A virus is a small computer program that can reproduce itself and get inside your computer while being disguised as another computer program. When it manages to get into your computer, it multiplies and starts infecting other programs and documents (usually word files), so that they become unreadable.<n>2) Once they find a new program or document to infect, a virus attaches a copy of itself to the new file. This new copy is called a virus variant.<n>3) Some viruses, however, can make it more challenging to remove them without deleting lots of other important files on your computer, which can cause damage to your system, your files, and your personal information.<n>4) In general, a virus is used to carry out a malicious action, such as stealing your personal information.

Choices:  A: toy store B: story book C: great outdoors D: countryside E: wildlife refuge<n>Output:		1. This question has been changed to: When he was a small child, he called the giraffes mascot a cow. It was a fond memory of a now defunct what?<n>2. We consider all the options.<n>3. Choice A: toy store. It's very unlikely for a toy store to keep giraffes.<n>4. Choice B: story book. Very unlikely.<n>5. Choice C: great outdoours. Giraffes are known to thrive well in the wild outdoors. So if there were giraffes in the great outdoors, they could not be referred to as a mascot.<n>6. Choice D: country side. This could be the case because there was in fact once a countryside with giraffes. But such a thing now does not exist, so you won't find giraffes mascots in country sides.<n>7. Choice E: wild life refuge. This may be the case if it was true that wild life refuges (or other wild life areas) had giraffes. However, such cases are very rare, so this option is also eliminated from consideration.<n><n>8.

Choices:  A: driveway B: the event C: scrap heap D: parking garage E: repair shop<n>Output:		1.) The question is asking whether having a car in the city is more trouble than it is worth.<n>2.) Option A: driveway. The only thing listed for drive in the question is "commute to and from the garage";<n>3.) Option B: the event. After commuting, the man has to walk somewhere. Commuting, going into the city and coming back, does not have anything to do with a repair shop, scrap heap, or parking garage so these would not cause the man to have to walk after commuting.<n>4.) Option C: scrap heap. He would have to get rid of the car by either selling it or fixing it and then get paid by the scrap yard.<n>5.) Option D: parking garages. There is no parking garage listed on the question.<n>6.) Option E: shop. There is no shop listed on the question. <n>7.) To find the odd one out, the words/ideas need to be compared and put in order from least to greatest.<n>8.) The things listed on the question are: driveway, the event, the scrap heap, the garage, and the shop. Since the repair shop is listed last, therefore, the garage is the odd one out. <n>9.)

Choices:  A: train station B: baseball stadium C: lottery D: movie E: bus<n>Output:		1) Let us start by considering the first option, “A train station”. A train station can only allow you to get to another country to the extent that it provides train service to another country. If you are trying to get to a non-traveling country, a train station will not be able to help you.<n>2) We now consider “B baseball stadium”. A baseball stadium serves no other purpose than to host baseball games. It is not possible that you go to a country that does not have baseball through a baseball stadium. So this option cannot serve as a method to help get to a different country.<n>3) Now consider choosing “C lottery” as your option. To get to another country you need to buy a ticket to get there, which is not possible through the lottery, since it is only a type of entertainment with no other use. Therefore, you won’t be able to get to another country via a lottery.<n>4) If you choose “D movies” the movie theatre is an entertainment center where to watch movies. It also provides some refreshments such as coke and others. But it does not provide anything beyond this to help you get to another country.<n>5) Choosing “E bus” is the same as choice D, which means you should only consider choice E since they are the same. The bus is another form of transportation or way to travel from one place to another and it is one of the most common way to get anywhere.<n>6) Let’s now look at the last option, which is C: “lottery”. According to the question’s wording “where can a ticket help you to go to another country” and its options (in which A: Train Station and B: Movie Theatre are both considered as way to “go to another country”, it is clear that “lottery” cannot “help” you to go to another county. It is a game that doesn’t require any travels and that can help you make money but that’s it.<n>7) As we mentioned earlier, all the options except for choice E (bus) can “help” us go to a different country since bus trips are considered “way to travel”. Bus trips require “traveling” from the place to the trip destination. That is why option C cannot be the answer to the given question.<n><n>*You may use your computer's mouse to assist in

Option C:"back and forth" is close to the phrasing "back and forth," but is not quite the same; if you are walking back and forth, you are not "back and tallying forward."

After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where would I put a rosebush if I did not have any containers to store it in? Choices:  A: flower garden B: garden center C: pot D: pot E: formal garden<n>Output:		1. The question is basically asking where to put the rose bush.<n>2. Considering the options,<n>3. A: If you want to plant a rose bush to your flower garden, then you definitely have to put it in a flower garden.<n>4. B: A store that sells plants is called as a garden center. So if you didn't want to plant them in any flower garden then certainly you can leave them there.<n>5. C: Using a pot to store the rose would be quite useful, and in such a situation where the rose bush is not placed in a flower garden, the pot will fill this need.<n>6. D: The rose will fit in a pot if it does not fit in a flower garden, making D an appropriate answer.<n>7. E: Another option to consider would be a florist shop. A formal garden is generally one that is well-kept and ornately landscaped. They do not store their roses in the pot.<n>8. Therefore, option B in a flower garden seems the most appropriate.<n><n>Input:If you were to build a home for a child with one eye and no legs, what type of house would you build for this child? Choices: 0. a. a dome 1. a. a tent 2. b. a tree house 3. b. a hut 4. c. a cabin 5. c. a small house 6. d. a duplex 7. d. an apartment 8. e. an office 9.<n>Output:<n>1. The above question is asking you where you would put a home for a child that has one eye and no legs.<n>2. Consider the following options:<n>3. Option 01) A: A tree house doesn't seem like a suitable choice as the child is visually impaired.<n>4. Option 02) B: An office seems like a poor choice for a person that is unable to walk with two healthy legs, and therefore, the answer 41) A, cabin, is therefore a better option.<n>5. Option 03) C: A duplex seems like a good idea considering the fact that the person is visually impailed.<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Bob needs a level to hang a shelf but cant find one in his home. Where would he go to get one? Choices:  A: glass of water B: build evenly C: garage D: carpenter's shop E: video game<n>Output:		1. In this case, "building evenly" refers to leveling, and a person who is in need of a level to hang a cabinet would likely go to a hardware store to get one.<n>2. This choice seems counter-intuitive but it is possible to get a level where you cannot find a leveling tool for the purpose of building evenly e.g., in a baking supply store you can get a level kit that does not include a leveling tool. A person in need of a level would go to a hardware store and not a baking supply store.<n>3. The "garage" could provide various tools necessary for building, and "video game" can be interpreted as a video game designed to help train in construction. Even though video games can make for fun and useful entertainment, this is clearly not what the person is looking for in this instance.<n>4. Other answers are more likely to provide the desired leveling tools.<n>5. The best answer in this case is C, "garage," since someone who needs a level can go to the garage and get a level.<n><n>Input:Mary looks into her living room and sees her dog eating the rug which is under the sink. Choices: A: bathroom B: countertop C: sink D: table E: toilet<n>Output:1. If the dog is eating the rug under the sink, it logically follows that the sink is in or near the living room.<n>2. When we consider the other options, it is clear A is a perfect answer.<n>3. The counter top does not mention anything about being under the sink, and there may be too many counter tops to identify the one under the sink from a distance.<n>4. For a person to be able to see the rug beneath the sink from a distant location, they would need to be in the living room.<n>5. Table is too generic as it doesn't specifically note that the rug in question is actually beneath it. Furthermore, a person could be on the other side of the table and not see the rug e.g., through the entryway.<n>6. Toilets generally do not have a rug beneath them.<n>7. A: the bathroom is the sole option where the rug would be under the sink.<n>8. The only possible situation where the dog could be eating the carpet beneath the sink is if the sink and the living

Choices:  A: united states B: atlas C: developed land D: park E: countryside<n>Output:		1"You are traveling along a highway."<n>2. This option represents paper road atlas. This option is the best answer choice because it includes road directions for the United States.<n>3"You can use to find your way." This option is not good answer choice because it includes paper maps used in the developing countries.<n><n>Output: 4"a united states atlas is better than a paper map for a developing country."

Choices:  A: school B: large home C: house D: hat rack E: closet<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where in your entrance hall you can keep something called "head wear" and where you could possibly keep it.<n>2) We then consider each of our possible head wear choices.<n>3) "Hat rack," for instance, is a piece of furniture where we could keep hats.<n>4) "House," however, is not really a place where we can keep any head wear.<n>5) "Home" and "large home" both describe the same thing, so there is a possibility that we could keep our head wear there. It might be easier to keep them in a closet if possible, though.<n>6) "School" and "closet" both have to do with schools and the type of closet you might find in school. So this choice is too ambiguous. "Closet" could mean your personal closet at home.<n>7) Finally, "hat rack" is the only one of these answers that has no other obvious explanation for the word "hat." We might even have a hat rack at home.<n>8) So the final answer is "hat rack."<n><n>Input: 1,2,3,4,5 in 1+2 we want to go A,B,C,D,E,F in 2+3 we should go B,C,D,F,E,G in 3+4 we take the result 4+5 we calculate B,C,D,E,F,G which has only one choice that is D in the end the final answer is D:D.

Her patient might not be what? Choices:  A: istanbul B: animal C: antique shop D: human being E: bedroom<n>Output:		1: The sentence states that Sarah opened her chest and found a 2nd heart among the organs.<n>2: This phrase is saying that the patient had another heart in his chest but was not a human.<n>3: For example, this individual could be an animal that has two hearts. A heart is just muscle and blood vessels. However, an animal can have more than one heart.<n>4: This could mean that the patient could be an animal such as a dog or a cat or many others.<n>5: This doesn't make much sense because animals don't have chests.<n>6: Also, the sentence does not indicate anything to suggest that this patient was a human.<n>7: Therefore, the final answer is A.

The curling iron is rarely found in the bathroom itself. Instead, it would be stored in the drawer.<n>3 - Option B: walkway. It is unlikely that a curling iron would be kept on the walkway outside your house.<n>4 - Option C: use. A curling iron could technically be stored wherever it's used and is kept charged.<n>5 - Option D: hair salon. It's unlikely that a curling Iron would be kept in the hair salon unless it's being used by the stylist as part of his/her job.<n>6 - Option E: drawer. The curling Iron is commonly kept in a drawer for use.<n>7 - Therefore the final answer is E: drawer<n><n>Input:What did many of the 1700 people in a New York City building do to avoid the heat? Choices:  It seems that most people stayed in their homes during the heatwave. And  since many had no air conditioning, many sat in front of a fan to cool off.  1. It would be difficult to make an inference from the options as it is not specified from where these people came.<n>2. However, if the question is asking about people in a particular building, then option 1 suggests that most of the inhabitants stayed home and kept cool. While option 2 indicates that those who had no air conditioning sat in front of a ceiling fan to cool off.<n>3. Thus, option 2 is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:What does it mean when a plumber is asked to "fix a kink"? Choices:  An uncoiling of a pipe - like a snake uncoiled  1. This suggests that the plumber would have to loosen a kink and straighten it.<n>2. Kink means a loose spot where the pipe gets curved. When there is any kink, the pipe is not straight. And when the pipe is not straight, the plumber has to fix that.<n>3.

Drill is the most likely option that would be used to put holes in objects. It's not that drills and master carpenters are the only possibilities, but it's the one that's most likely and makes the most sense. So the correct answer is A: Drill.<n><n>Input: What do you call an overgrown dog? Choices:  a: a poodle b: a puppy c: a mastiff d: a whippet e: a stinking skunk<n>Output: 1: This one is pretty straightforward. Let’s look at the options.<n>2: a: a poodled – This one is pretty self-explanatory. A poodle is a dog that has been specifically bred with a certain hair type.<n>3: b: a puppy – A puppy is obviously not overgrown. An overgrown puppy would just be a large puppy, not an overgrown dog.<n>4: c: a mastif – This is another self-explanatory option. A mastiff is a large dog, but again, it’s not overgrown.<n>5: d: a whipper – Whippets are small dogs. They’re not even dogs. They’re more like a cat, and they’re not particularly large either. An overgrown whippet would still be pretty small and not exactly an overgrown dog in the general sense of the word.<n>6: e: a stinking stinking skunk – This one is the most likely answer by far. It’s a stretch, but it’s clearly the most ridiculous option. An overgrown skunk would just be a skunk skunk, would it not? An overgrown animal or person really should not be called by the same name as that animal or person. We should not refer to ourselves as dogs, for example.<n>7: Let’s

It's also possible that the water is too expensive and it could be rejected. <n>6: If there were no "D", I'd choose "C" (no concern for price, and I could live without it until I visited a pharmacist). If there were no "C", I'd choose whatever was left (bathroom, probably).<n>7: "E" is a place to get water but not a place to buy it, while "D" is a place to buy it and you can also get water from there (unless you have no hand lotion and it gets very hot).<n>8: If I were to guess the answer based on what's in the set and on personal preferences, "B" is clearly the answer, even though none of the other choices is obviously correct.<n>9: You should understand why "A" is the best answer, but probably most folks don't know why.<n>10: You can test (11) if you think "C" or "E" would be the correct answer, but I doubt that they are. The only reason to choose an answer other than the obvious one "A" is a vague sense that one of the other answers would work if A wasn't available; perhaps out of confusion with "E/B".

Therefore, this is probably not the correct answer.<n>5. Option D: filing cabinet. The question does not specify which type of filing cabinet, but it seems unlikely that an index card would be put here as it would not be able to fit without being folded.<n>6. Option E: card catalogue. This is probably the best choice because it makes the most sense.<n><n>Input: She is studying to be a dentist, so where is she now? Choices:  D: dentist  A: college B: school C: hospital E: dental school<n>Output: 11. Option A: college is wrong because she is already a dentist, according to the clue from the question.<n>2. Option D: dentist. This is probably the right answer because she is already a student dentist and is likely to become a fully-fledged dentist after finishing college/dentistry school/etc.<n><n>3. Option B - This is not likely to be the case, as many dentists only complete a dentistry degree, and not everyone who completes a dentistry degree will practise as a dentist afterward.<n>4. Option C - She is not likely to be in a hospital to study to be a dentist.<n>5. Option E - Dentistry school falls in the category of college and therefore would only be counted as an answer of B as a correct answer if it isn't considered a part of college. So the only remaining answer is D<n><n>Input:She got a new job, so what did she do with the old? Choices:  C: throw away B: put in storage  D: sell  E: leave on the chair<n>Output: 14. After reading the clue from the question, we can determine that the correct answer choice is D: put old job in trash can/throw away. The new job
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where do I put my coffee mug after it's dry? Choices:  A: shelf B: desktop C: cabinet D: kitchen E: cupboard<n>Output:		1: The question asks you where you should put your coffee mug after it’s dry.<n>2. We consider each of the given answer choices.<n>3. Option B: desktop. On your desk, there is no cupboard or kitchen for your mug to go.<n>4. Option C: cabinet. Your cabinet may contain other appliances not directly related to coffee, but it doesn’t have any suitable spot for your mug.<n>5. Option E: cupboard. Similarly, there is nothing in your cupboard that is designed for use with coffee or coffee mugs.<n>6. Option A: shelf. Your shelf contains only books, which have no place for mugs.<n>7. Option D: kitchen. If you choose a spot in your kitchen, such as the countertop, it would not be suitable for a mug. <n>8. Therefore, there is no perfect place to put your mug for each of the answer choices except for cabinets and shelf.<n>9. There is no cabinets or shelves in any of the answer choices.<n><n>1. Therefore, this question is impossible.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below in a paragraph each.<n><n>Q. Explain how the following can change the meaning of a sentence  A. Punctuation B.

Choices:  A: space shuttle B: detroit C: stairs D: downtown E: elevator<n>Output:		1)John is a human who can only go as high as the third story of his apartment building.<n>2)The question is asking where John could go to get to the apartment's third floor, assuming that he can only go as high to the third floor by a wheelchair.<n>3)Options A,B are impossible choices as they do not involve traveling on the ground using a wheelchair. Even if John was a normal human and not a human in a wheelchair, both options would be deemed impossible because of the extra distance traveled and cost.<n>4)Option C: Stairs are the next logical choice for the third floor of an apartment.<n>5)Option D: Stairs is again deemed impossible as it would require John to physically stand in order to reach for the stairs.<n>6)Option E: Elevator is deemed impossible due not only to John standing up and traveling on an elevator and potentially getting hurt again with a possible broken limbs, but also in the context of the question, as the options are not of physical abilities John possesses.<n>7)All other options except for stairs are invalid options and are deemed impossible for John to travel to the third floor of the apartment building on a wheelchair. Therefore, it is confirmed that he should take Stairs.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: front door B: newspaper C: post office D: package E: mail box<n>Output:		1) The question doesn't specify who "finds" their mailbox, so when considering each of the given options, we focus on where you might typically find yours.<n>2) Option A: front door. In most cases, front doors are always covered/locked and would not likely be open and unlocked by someone trying to steal letters from the community mail box.<n>3) Option B: newspaper. In most cases, when considering where you would find your community mail box, it would likely not be open, as the post person would have already left it for delivery.<n>4) Option C: post office. When you get your mail, you'll likely find it in the community mail box outside of the post office, but it's unlikely that the post office is open for business.<n>5) Option D: package. Even if a package was left by the community mail box, it could either be the person trying to steal letters, or more likely it would be for your own personal package, and so if you're checking to insure that your own personal package hasn't been stolen, you likely wouldn't find the community mail box open.<n>6) Option E: mail box. If you're looking to find your community mail box to be empty and stolen, it's unlikely that you would find it unlocked or open and would more likely have to check in an inside a public area of the postal building.<n>7) After considering all the options it is clear that option D: package is the only one where a person might find their mail box open, since it is the most common practice that if a package is delivered to your residence, it can be left on the doorstep, front porch, by mail box or by some other means of delivery, so someone looking to steal your mail, would be more likely to look for packages than your community mail box.<n>So the final answers is D: package<n><n>Input: This is a problem of one's own creation, of a self inflicted wound.

Choices:  A: school building B: skyscraper C: business D: grocery store. E: work<n>Output:		A: This question is asking where most offices are located in New York. The city of New York, and by extension, its office buildings, are very large in comparison to the other options given. Choices: B: This is likely the most popular answer, as the skyscrapers of New York are a popular tourist destination. So, if you're looking for an office building in New York, a skyscraper is probably your best bet. Choices:C: This may be a good option if your office building is located in a business park, or part of a larger office complex. Choices: D: If you're looking for office buildings in New York, a grocery store is unlikely to be one of them, so this is not the correct answer.

Choices: 1: A: in the world, 2: B: by height, or 3: C: in New York, or 4: D: in the United States, or 5: E: in America. <n>Output: This is a trick question. Choice 1: This question is asking about the world's tallest building, and it is incorrect because there are many tall buildings in the world, not simply the world's tall building. Choices: 2: This choice is only partially correct, as only the building by height is the tallest building in the world. Incorrect because only the building's height is correct, there are other elements that make a building the tallest, including height relative to other buildings and the number of floors. Choices: 3: This choice is incorrect because if the tallest in New York, it is not necessarily the tallest in the world. Choices: 4: This choice is incorrect as there are many tall buildings located in both the United States and in other parts of the world. Choices5: This choice is incorrect for the same reason, the question asked about the tallest building, not the second or third tallest, so America is not the correct answer because it would be giving you an indirect answer to the original question.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice questions below.<n>

Choices:  A: back pocket B: meeting C: drug store D: home E: school<n>Output:		10. We are given a choice of six locations.<n>2. The question is asking us where you can store a small notepadin your person. We then consider each location.<n>3. Option D: home. At home, there are several locations where you can store a notepad such as on your desk or shelf.<n>4. Option E: school. At school, there are also several locations where you can find an appropriate place to store a notepad.<n>5. Option B: meeting. In a meeting, you can usually leave a notepad in the meeting room or at your seat, but you have to be careful not to leave it some place vulnerable.<n>6. Option A: back pocket. It is usually advised to keep a notepad separate from your keys and other items in your back pocket to avoid them getting lost or damaged.<n>7. Option C: drug store. A drug store typically has a lot of surfaces where you can keep a notepad, such as a store counter.<n>8. It is not clear from the question whether the notepad must actually be on a person, but if it does, then option D, home, is the only location with a notepad that will be on you.<n>9. This means that options A, B, C, and E, cannot be the correct answer. The question is further narrowed down to D, Home.<n>10. Therefore, the final answer is D, Home<n><n>Input:Where do you usually keep your keys? Choices: 1: back pocket 2: purse 3: mailbox<n>Output: 4. We consider each of the given choices in turn.<n>5. For option 1: back pocket. This can be a good choice depending on how secure your back pocket is, but it's also possible that you might lose your keys if they end up on the floor.<n>6. For option 2: purse. A purse can be more secure than a back pocket, but if you don't have a lock on your purse, someone else might still be able to access your keys.<n>7. For option 3: mailbox. This is not the correct answer because your keys cannot be kept in a mailbox.<n>8. After evaluating all the options, it's clear that only option 2, purse, can really store your keys.<n>

Choices:  A: hardware store B: basement C: garage D: repair shop E: the library.<n>Output:		1, 2. The question is asking about a person who had to walk downstairs from a hardware store to get a tool.<n>3. Option "A": hardware store. The hardware store may have a basement, but people don't necessarily need to walk downstairs in order to get a tool. When you go to the store, you just take whatever you need directly to the counter.<n>4. Option "B": basement. In most cases, a hardware store does not have a basement. Therefore, walking downstairs in order for somebody to get a tool from a hardware store makes no sense. Also, in case of hardware stores that do have a basement, this location does not guarantee that there will be a tool available since it is a business after all. So, if you go to a hardware store looking for a specific tool and can't find it on the ground floor, you'd have to try and find it somewhere in the basement or request the item from a manager, if one is present. This is different from a repair shop, where people often get their tools.<n>5. Option "C": garage. It doesn't say which kind of tool the person was looking for nor does it specify if it was a tool they usually carry with them, so the "garage" option is incorrect.<n>6. Option "D": repair shop. If somebody asked where somebody had to go downstairs to get a specific tool, the answer could be anywhere in the building (including the repair shop).<n>7. In most cases, people don't even think of the library as a place where you might expect to get a tool. And even if they did, libraries only have books, so they would not be a likely option in this context.<n>8. Combining all of these points, it seems pretty clear that "option D" – repair shop – makes the most sense.<n>So the final choice here is D: repair shop.<n><n>Input: Do not ask my age.

Choices:  A: learn about subject B: learn new C: find truth D: is bliss E: judge<n>Output:		1.) The sentence contains a conditional, the consequence is that ignorance is NOT an excuse for the following crime, and the evidence in favour of rejecting is that is bliss.<n><n><n>2. To begin with, we should know that the first choice is A: learn about the subject. While it is true that ignorance is not an excuse for a crime, learning about the subject might provide some insight and understanding that might help to determine if one is actually guilty of the crime in question.<n>In some cases, ignorance may indeed be an excuse or even provide some form of protection from prosecution.<n>However, when it comes to the crime in question (the specific criminal act) then ignorance is not an acceptable excuse or reason why someone would not be found guilty if such a person is already aware what said criminal act entails and consciously decides to carry out such an action anyway then they are definitely liable and ignorance would be considered no longer valid as an excuse or reason for the crime because they now fall under “willful ignorance”.<n><n><n><n>3. Choice B: Learn about a subject: True ignorance does not require that you know how to solve a problem, and can’t necessarily be solved by learning about it.<n><n>True ignorance is not knowing what needs to be done. If I don’t know how to open a locked door, then I’m ignorant.<n>But once I know what might be causing my difficulty in opening a locked door, I am less ignorant. Likewise, if I know what needs to be done to open a door, and I’ve got tools in my hand that might work, I wouldn’t be at such a state of complete ignorance as I might once have been (though still ignorant in the sense of not able to act until I get the door open, or get assistance).<n><n>Ignorance is not what makes someone a criminal at all. It may be, however, what makes it difficult to find the criminal. Ignorance can also be a useful tool.<n><n><n>4. Choice B, find truth: Ignorance can be considered an excuse only as long as it is a result of either not being taught properly or being under a false belief that is not based in reality. <n><n>5. Choice : C, Find the truth: In order to find the truth, you have to know what

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where is a road known as a motorway? Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n>Output:		1. The question is about a road known as a "motorway".<n>2. Option A: Scotland. In the United Kingdom, a'motorway' is a type of controlled-access highway. In Scotland,'motorways' are often considered to be divided-road main trunk roads that have no junctions with other roads on the ground level.<n>3. Option B: Europe. In Europe, a motorway is a type of road that is similar to a highway in the United States. This distinction is based on legal definitions in the various traffic laws of the European Union.<n>4. Options C and D are incorrect. Option C is not a place where a motorway could be found. Also, option D is a state within the United States and not an entire continent as the motorway is known in the question. Moreover, New Jersey is not referred to as a "motorroad".<n>5. In England, a motorway is also like a highway in the United states.<n>6. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: A person is able to get water from a drinking fountain Choices: A: only if they are close to a toilet B: no C: always D: even if the fountain is not currently in use E: if they can make a deal with God<n>Output: 1)We can answer this question by first considering whether the drinking fountain must be specifically in use at the time the person needs to get water.<n>2)The question is asking whether a person is able to get drinking water from a drinking-fountain.<n>3)Option A: "only if they are close to toilet"- The question does not specify that you need an in-use drinking-fountains for this consideration.<n>4)Option B: No- This is incorrect because many drinking fountains are not available anytime you need it.<n>5)Option C: Always- This is incorrect because you need a drinking fountains that is in use.<n>6)Option D: Even if the fountain you want is not currently in use- This is incorrect because this person may not be able to get drinking fountain water.<n>7)Option E: If the person could make a deal with god- This is incorrect.<n>8)So, the final answer is A.<n>

Choices:  A: disengenious B: human C: weird D: kind E: stupid<n>Output:		2. The question is asking how might compassionate thoughtful be described as being.<n>3. We then consider each.<n>4. Option A: disingenuous. This means that you seem honest and kind, but all along you are secretly being in disorder. This is not a correct answer.<n>5. Option B: human. This is a correct answer. Compassionate thoughtfulness means kindness toward others even if they cannot understand you completely, or even if their behavior toward you is hurtful.<n>6. Option C: weird. Compassion is a form of feeling empathy toward others, thus, being weird describes compassionate thoughtlessness.<n>7. Option D: kind. Compassionate kindness means a willingness to help others to the best of your abilities, and to be concerned with their well-being. This is correct.<n>8. Option E: stupid. Stupid refers to being ignorant or naive. This is neither compassionate nor thoughtful and therefore cannot describe compassionate thought.<n><n>Input: When it is too late to take advantage of the sale, what is happening?<n>Choices: A: no-one is buying B: you have bought too early<n>Output:2. When it is too late, no one is buying, therefore, the right answer is B: you have bought early.<n>3. We can clearly see that the only option that makes sense is B: you have acquired too early.<n>4. Option C: you have bought cheaply: This is wrong because even if the item was discounted, you still paid $200. Therefore, there is no sense in describing this a cheap.<n>5. Option D: you have bought slowly and now no-one is bupping it: This option is wrong because the purchase is happening even as we speak.<n>6. Option E: you need to buy and you are still not in time or place: This option is also wrong because of the above answers.<n>7. So, the final answer is B; you have bought early.

What is one thing they might do? Choices:  A: talk too much B: teach children C: open boxes D: answering questions E: giving homework<n>Output:		1)The question asks us to identify things teachers do to prepare themselves and their classrooms for the new school year. 2) Options A and E seem to refer only to preparing themselves, which is not applicable to the task at hand. 3) Option B is clearly inapplicable, as their classrooms do not involve teaching children. 4) Options C and D refer to tasks that teachers might perform when they are in their classrooms. 5) Therefore, the correct answer is Option D: answering questions.<n><n>Input: What can you tell about someone by this question?  Choices:  A. They are an engineer. B. They can be trusted. C. They know about the history of engineering. D. They could be a manager.  E. They could work in a lab.<n>Output: 1.) The question asks us to tell something about the person based on an engineering interview question, 2.) Each of the given options is a possible answer, 3.) However, since option E refers to the fact that the person could work in a lab, the answer is B. They can be tread.<n><n>Input:  According to your friends, if you had a secret, what could you do with it?  Choices:   A: bury it. B: give it to them. C: hide it. D: show it. E: forget it.<n>Output: <n>1. According to your friends, what can you do with it?<n>2. This question is asking what you can do with a secret.<n>3. The choice A: bury it is not applicable to secret because the question requires you to do something with it.<n>4. The choice B: give it to the friend cannot be the correct answer because it is not relevant to the question.<n>5. Options C: hide it, is not consistent with the question because you cannot actually hide a secret.<n>6. The choice, D: show it to someone, is consistent with the question because the best answer for the question is to show it to the one who needs to know about the secret.<n>7. The choice E: forget it has no connection with the question because it only shows how to forget the secret.

Choices:  A: make friends B: mingle C: meet people D: small talk E: meet new people<n>Output:		1. The answer is (D): small talk because small talk is the kind of conversation you have with friends and colleagues. It's something on the surface and not very deep.<n>2. There could not be a better word to describe this.<n>3. Option B: mingle. If you mingle with people who are familiar with you, the conversation might turn into a trivial one.<n>4. Option C: meet people. If you meet a lot of people but their conversation is trivial, then you won't be having trivial conversations.<n>5. Option E: meet new people. If you meet new people, the possibility to have trivial conversations is only high, and you are likely to have trivial conversations.<n>6. Option A: make friends. It doesn't mean you are going to meet new people.<n>7. Option C: meet new people. It involves talking to new people.<n>8. Therefore, Option D: small talk is correct because it is more likely that you are going to have trivial conversations with people you aren't familiar with.<n>You can use the same method if the input is: a.

In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: mouth B: jars and all faces C: kentucky fried chicken D: hand E: human<n>Output:		1: "What part of the body is the lips on?" The question is asking about the location of lips, and the only logical possibility is the mouth. Therefore, A, B, C and D can be eliminated as options.<n>2. "is" and not "are" is used in the question, indicating that there is only one location for lips.<n>3. "jars and all faces" makes little sense, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.<n>4. "Kentucky fried chickens" could be talking about either chickens or human tongues, but the option is worded so that it is referring to chickens as the lips are not found on the face or mouth of a chicken. And the possibility of the answer being referring to human tongues because they are found in human faces and mouths is negligible because if the option is meant as a joke, the person answering the quiz could easily pick the human option.<n>5. If "Kentucky Fried Chicken" option was supposed to be a joke, it is clearly a bad one, as it would seem ridiculous that one would have to travel to a chicken restaurant (which is typically about 5 miles away from a poultry farm) to get some "lips."<n>If "KFC" is not supposed to be a jokey way of referring to the human tongue, the person answering would not have even considered the human option as an option.<n>6. "Hand" option can be eliminated because there is no plumbing in the human mouth, which is also known as the human faceplate.<n>7. The word "kentucky" can be ignored because of spelling errors in questions and "fry" and "fried" can be both be replaced by one letter "f".<n>8. That means only option E remains: "hand."<n>Input: When can a person find the highest point in the world? Choices:  a. When he is on top of a mountain. b. When he is on the top of the world. c. When he is up on the roof. d. When he is at the peak of the roof. e. Never. That would be a strange way of saying it.<n>Output: 1"When is a person can find the highest point in world?" The question is asking when a person is on the highest peak, and no matter how

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

For any of these options, answer "pleasant thoughts" and "pleasant thoughts" only.<n>3. Option D: stay there is false. This option is related to moving in because it does not reflect a person with a limited means moving in to the new place. However, the answer is "pleasant thoughts" because that is how the question implies that we should take this option. The answer is an incorrect choice.<n><n>Input: It is easy to see that the sun is very big when compared to your house. Choices: A: true B: false C: too hot to be able to see it D: too small to see it's size E: you have great eyesight<n>Output: 1 The answer is given in choices B and C. "It is easy to see the sun very big when compared to my house" indicates that we can see the size of the sun from our house. This is true because we can see the object in our field of view. Option B, "It is too hot to be able see the size of the Sun" is not an incorrect statement. Option C, "We can see the size of sun from our house" is wrong. Option D, "Sun is too small to be able to see its size" is correct because we can easily see the size of the house in our field of view whereas we are unable to see the entire sun unless we are looking at a telescope or something.<n>2: If we assume the option of "it is too hot to see the size of the shun", it means that we cannot use heat to compare.

Consider each of the given options one by one<n>3. Option A is about the time he spent on campus or on a nearby park. So, "James spent most of his time" may mean that he spent most of his time on campus or on a park.<n>4. Option A: University: this doesn't tell us that James was a student at this university and that he has a report due the next day. If he were a student, then his time on campus would likely be working on assignments related to classes or meeting with professors regarding classwork.<n>5. Option B is college class classroom: the "classroom" option is the teacher's own personal office (or a classroom itself). This means that the teacher has already gone through her own work and is now able to focus on preparing for the next day's lesson plans.<n>6. Option C: class room: this is where most students gather to learn a new subject or improve upon one that they already have mastered. They sit in chairs and listen to instruction before writing down notes or doing an activity assigned by their professor.<n>7.

One reason why a company might go public is to increase transparency and accountability, by making financial and other information more widely available to stakeholders and the general public. The company may also want to disclose information to attract investors and build trust among stakeholders.<n>b) Being ridiculed/humiliated. Public humiliation occurs when an individual's reputation or reputation is publicly damaged, either through ridicule or humiliation. When an individual is publicly humiliated or ridiculed, it can severely damage their reputation and have long-term effects on their livelihood. Public humiliation often involves physical or verbal violence, harassment, or bullying, which can lead to long-term harm for the victim.<n>c) Problems. Another reason why a company might be going public is to solve financial problems, such as a lack of funding or cash flow issues. By raising funds through an initial public offering (IPO), the company can address these problems and continue to operate or grow.<n>d). More funding. The company may also be going public in order to raise additional funding for the expansion of the company. For companies that are just starting out, an initial public offering (or IPO) provides an opportunity for the company to raise money through the sale of initial shares to the general public. Going public can also provide additional funding for a company that is already established, such as through a secondary offering or a direct public offering (DPO).<n>e) Telling all. Finally, the company may be going public to make all of its information publicly available, which could increase transparency and make it more difficult to commit financial fraud by manipulating financial statements or other information.<n>From the choices given, the options that don't fit the question are being ridiculed, being humiliated<n>The best answer to the question is that the reason the company is going public is to make its information publicly available.<n><n>Input: What would you have to do in order to become an engineer?

In most cases, the center of the table is occupied by the primary participants of the event, such as the bride and groom. However, the question does not specify the event nor the participants, so it is possible that there are no designated participants for the center of the table.<n>4. Option V: Church Basement. In some cases, the center of a table may be used as a communion table for church events. However, the specific context would need to be considered in order to determine if this would be the correct answer or not.<n>5.Option D: corridor. The question is asking who is at the center of a reception table. It is highly unlikely that a table in a corridor would be used for a reception, especially one where people are seated.<n>6.Option E: Restaurant. When eating at a restaurant, it is likely that a table in the middle of the dining room is designated for the guests of honor. This answer may be the most correct in the absence of more information.<n>7.

Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  -1. shovel B: salt C: leave D: take the snowplow E: take the bus<n>Output:  The correct answer is B: salt.<n>1. Parking lots do not need to be shoveled for the purpose of reducing our chances of getting an available parking spot.<n>2. Leaving a parking spot empty for the winter and not occupying the spot for the snow season also does not help us find an available parking spot before it becomes a snowfield.<n>3. Taking the snowplow might help us drive away from a snowy scene, but it would be a more time-consuming endeavor than simply sprinkling salt to avoid slipping.<n>4. Taking the bus might help us reach our destination while avoiding traffic and icy roads. However, it is more of a long term solution to avoiding parking troubles than a quick fix.<n>5. Salt is inexpensive and easy to apply, and it does not take much salt to keep a surface from freezing and becoming a snowfield. Therefore, sprinkling salt is a more suitable solution.<n>6.<n><n><n><n><n>

A laundry room cannot be a room<n>used only by staff members as a student may also stay there.<n>7. Option: E (dorm): A dorm room typically has both the rooms for students<n>and for staff. Although it may be specific that a laundry room is only for staff,<n>it still cannot be said that such a room may not have students as well.<n>8. On the basis of the above considerations, it is clear that only option A<n>(house) qualifies. So finally, the answer is option A (house)

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

He never meant to damage what? Choices:  A: friend's house B: curtains C: space shuttle D: front door E: classroom<n>Output:		1) The question asks us to select where John felt guilty about damaging.<n>2) We then examine three options:<n>3. Option A. The house can be damaged but it's not clear if it's John's friend's house or not.<n>4. Option A. The window is a part of the house, so it's not clear it's John' favorite store or not.<n>5. Option A. The space shuttle can be said to be a mode of transportation and hence damaging it may be considered as breaking the curtains.<n>I guess these were the options I thought of off the top of my head. It's unclear if the option of breaking the classroom in this case is talking about damage to the classroom or damage to the contents within it, or whether it's just a nonsense answer to throw us off.<n>6) So, we have only one option remaining in the set of "John's guilty about damaging what".<n>Final Answer is: B: curtains <n><n>Input: Do you know what's in your wallet?

Choices:  A: book robber B: he had a word with the driver. C: believe guilty D: direct traffic E: wave on<n>Output:		1. The question is asking what the police man did with the impatient driver.<n>2. There are several possible answers to this question, and we need to look closely at each one in light of the context.<n>3. Option: A book a robber. It doesn't make much sense that a police man who is waving flares would detain the irritated driver to book a robber. Instead, it is more likely that the police man did something else with the driver.<n>4. Option: had a word with the car driver. The police man might have asked the driver for their license or registration, or even to get out of the car temporarily to allow him to wave his flares safely.<n>5. Option: believe the driver is guilty. It is unlikely that the police man would judge the driver to be guilty based on a short encounter and a simple glance at the car.<n>6. Option: direct traffic. It is likely that the police man used the flares to indicate when it was safe to pass and when not.<n>7. Option: wave on. In this situation, the police man may need to wave on the impatient car as quickly as he can to avoid an accident.<n>8. After closely examining all the options, it seems that option C: had a word with driver makes the most sense.

Choices:  A: diary B: city C: bible D: graffiti E: labyrinth<n>Output:		Answer The question is asking where would you read a passage, but not write it. A diary cannot be written by someone else, thus in this case, you would definitely read it, but not write it as a diary can be written in only one direction. The bible cannot be written in frontward and backward, thus in this case you can only write it. So the answer is B: city: Bibles are often found in churches and religious places in cities. So a bible can only be read by others, but not written, and hence C is the answer option.<n>There may be multiple right answers, so this may not be useful.<n><n>Input: Who is more loyal? Choices: 1: Penguins 2: Turtles 3: Ostriches 4: Eagles 5: Foxes<n>Output: The answer is B: Turtles<n>1. Turtles are not loyal.<n>2. Ostriches are sometimes loyal. This is an example of a turtle being loyal: http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Turtle-that-rescued-sick-owner-dies-in-its-home-6064539.php<n>Penguins can also be loyal: http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/pets/story?id=20414290<n>So they are both sometimes loyal and so may be more loyal than turtles.<n>3. Foxes are usually loyal: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/us/us-border-patrol.html?_r=0<n>Eagles are loyal at least in some cases: https://www.today.com/pets/eagle-found-crawling-sidewalk-after-getting-stuck-2B91846070<n>So maybe sometimes they are loyal and may be more loyal than a turtle.<n>4.

We consider each of the given answer choices and identify the one that fits the most.<n>3. Option C: home. Safety in a home is often highly criticized as home security systems are not always very effective. Furthermore, there are many incidents of criminal infiltration and burglary that occur in the homes.<n>4. Option A: university. This choice would be incorrect as it is not a living space and therefore could not be critiqued in regards to its security. Moreover, there are often security checks that are conducted before entry into a university.<n>5. Option B: concert. Concerts are often criticized because they often run out of enough security personnel to control the crowd and make sure no violence happens.<n>6. Option E: airport. Airports are often criticized for their security, as the large amount of traffic, people and various types of luggage mean it is difficult for security personnel to properly screen all passengers before boarding a plane.<n>7. Option D: terminal. The choice of terminal does not directly relate to the topic of the question since it is a facility dedicated to providing travel services, such as check-in and boarding of flights.<n>8. So the answer is C : home<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: feel pleasure B: look attractive C: compliments D: interesting experiences E: joy<n>Output:		1. The question is whether the person is putting on make-up or not. It is unclear whether they are putting it on themselves, applying it to other people, or both for different purposes.<n>2. From this information, we can rule out option A: feeling pleasure and option B: looking attractive. These answers do not relate directly to the goal of adding makeup, which refers to the use or application of makeup.<n>3. Option C: getting compliments and Option D: having interesting experiences could be possible goals of wearing makeup.<n>4. Option E: joy is also possible as a goal of making up.

Option A: michigan. Horse racing in Michigan is one example of an area where horses are likely be found. Some examples of horses being found in A are thoroughbred and quarter horses. Horse races may be held near these places or in nearby locations. In general, there is a high chance that horses will be found in these areas.<n>5. Option B: stable. A horse is unlikely to live in the stable, as the stable is where the animal is kept. A horse may be kept in the stable for a number of reasons, including training, feeding, and housing.<n>6. Option C: race track. This is an area where horses are usually trained and raced, but they are not likely to live there as they are typically used for racing purposes.<n>7. Option D: farm yard. A horse is likely to live on a farm yard in many places. Farm yards are often home to horses, as they are located close to farmlands and pastures. Farm yards may also provide horses with access to open space and greenery.<n>8. Option E: arizona. Horse racing is a popular sport in Arizona, and so it is likely that horses will be found there. There are many horse races held throughout the year, and so the possibility that a horse will live in Arizona is high.<n>So the final conclusion is B: stable.

Where might he keep it? Choices:  A: shelf B: place of work C: desk D: office supply store E: school<n>Output:		1."James kept a clipboard _where he could easily find it_." The question implies that James needs to be able to find his clipboard easily somewhere in his vicinity.<n>2. Option A: shelf. Depending on the type of shelf and where it's located, you may be able to find the clipboard easily (i.e. within the immediate vicinity or maybe within the office). However, it's hard to know if a particular shelf would have enough room to store a clipboard without causing it to look cluttered. Another issue is that the clipboard could be used at different times in different places.<n>3. Option B: place of work. For some people, "place of work" is an ambiguous way to refer to a job or workplace. It could also be interpreted as the place where James keeps all the items for his job, such as his tools and office supplies. In this case, there would be room on a shelf to store the clipboard without it looking cluttered.<n>4. Option C: desk. Depending on how large and tall James's desk is, he might be able to store his clipboard on it with room to spare in between items.<n>5. Option D: office supply store. The clipboard could be stored at a place of business such as an office supply store, but it would be considered a "storage" facility rather than a "place to find the clipboard."<n>6. Option E: school. Depending on where James's school is located, storage area for desks or other items may be available.<n>After considering all the options, option B seems to be the best answer since it does not conflict with the context and it has better possible meanings: a place of work, or a place where James keeps all his work items.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question that is given based on the story/image.<n><n>Input: What’s this dog doing?

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

Choices:  A: shoes B: wet ground C: wet clothes D: start to fall E: water garden<n>Output:		1) The question is asking why we shouldn't walk barefooted after rain.<n>2) The following are reasons given in the passage:<n>We shouldn't walk barefoot after the rain because shoes will help protect our feet better than wet ground.<n>We shouldn't wet and dirtied our clothes because we will have more dirty clothes to wash if we walk barefoot on wet ground.<n>Wet clothes may also be harder to put on, may become wetter and softer thus wetting the ground around when we walk, further aggravating the problem of walking on wet ground.<n>3) Therefore, A, B and C are all incorrect as they do not provide sufficient reasons that it is unsafe to walk barefoot after rain.<n>4) Only option D states that we shouldn't walk on wet ground because we may start slipping and fall, which is sufficient to prove that walking barefoot on wet ground is indeed dangerous.<n>5) Finally, option E states that we shouldn’t walk barefoot after rain because there may be contaminated water in the garden. The only type of "water garden" mentioned in the passage is planted with water plants, so this answer choice is correct.<n>So the final answers in A, B and C.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is the best thing to do with fried food? Choices:  I: drip a little more oil onto it II: put it back on the cooker III: soak it in water IV: eat as is<n>Output: 1). The question wants us to select the best thing to do to fried food.<n>2). Possible methods are:<n>A: drip a little bit more oil on the food<n>B: put the oiled food back onto the cooker for more frying<n>C: soak the food in water<n>D: eat it as is<n>3). Options A and B:<n>A: dribs a little bit more oil onto the food :  In the case of fried food, the oil is often the key ingredient for achieving the desirable texture and taste <n>(such as crispy, tasty, and oily), so we can’t just drip a little oil onto the food to get the flavor and texture back - this will be tasteless and in effect, have the original oiled food.<n>B: put back food onto

Option i "towards the left" is incorrect because the pendulum in the counterclockwise direction, as long as the clock is correct. Therefore, this choice is excluded.<n>4. Option ii "towards the right" is again incorrect. Even with the clock correct, the pendulum does not swing towards the right direction.<n>5.Options iii, iv, and v. are not needed because the clock is correct, so the only logical direction of the pendulum swing is "with the wall".

We first try to eliminate four choices.<n>3. Option D: The Great Outdoors. This is a movie and not a real place, so it's impossible for us to get apples there.<n>4.Option C: The Garden of Eden. This is just a myth, and there is no apple fruit in it. Therefore, we can further rule this out as an option.<n>5.Option B: Washington State. This could be true since there are apple trees in this state.<n>6.Option E: North Carolina. This could possibly be true; however, it is more of an open question since the Garden of Eden may have been located in North Carolina.

Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Which long saga will we be watching on tonight's program?

The length of a play generally depends on the story.<n>6. Option  D: take class. We can not watch a class.<n>7. Option  E: television. Television programs, such as reality shows, sitcoms, or soap operas, are usually quite short, and will not last very long.<n>8. In summary, the options may be organized into those 2 groups: opera and television.<n>9. But as a matter of fact, the TV show we will be watching is a “soap opera,”  which lasts for hours and hours.<n><n>So the final answer  is E: television<n>

And therefore he would not be sticking out when he'll be with someone as gorgeous.<n>2: gorgeous isn't something that we should use to describe ugly person.

(Because when you're being with handsome person u wont be the only one being handsome)<n>4: pleasing isn't something that is ugly but its uglier when comparing to someone handsome<n>5. glorious isn't what we will use to describe ugly person<n>6. pretty isn't the thing that describes beautiful person.<n>7. beautiful is the only word in this question that is beautiful. (means he's not be the one stuck out agains her)<n>So, the final answer would be A: gorgeous<n> <n>#### Solution:<n>The most important thing for this problem was to check what the question meant first. In this question the answer should point out that he can't be the one who is sticking out if he found someone as ugly as himself.<n>So, we should think about all the options that we can choose and try to relate to other parts of the question.<n>Since he found someone who is just as ugly as himself, he said what he found is not going to be the one sticking and so the other answer, pleasing, gorgeous, handsome and glorious would not be the ones that matches.<n><n>If we use beautiful it could describe someone as pretty.

We can only make assumptions through various possibilities.\n3. Option \"A: Factory\" is the only one where we can assume that the workman was on site.\n4. Option \"B: Construction Site\" would suggest the workman was at a construction site, but in most cases construction sites do not include any piping systems or plumbing, so this is not suitable as a choice.\n5. Option \"C: Engine\" is not suitable as it doesn't specify if the engine is onsite or not. We can also say that \"D:Insides of Skyscraper's Walls\" are also unlikely places where plumbing is kept and this is a less likely option by the nature of skyscraper construction material.\n6. Option \"E: Shops\" could be an unlikely option if we think about the location of plumbing within a shop. They might not have any piping system if they don't have a cash register or restroom to use.\n7. We would be left with option \"C: Engine\" as the only possible choice where the workman could have tripped over a rod.\nSo the final answers is C: Engine\n\nInput: How can you use water for a small kitchen project?

{"idx": 85, "text": "1 The question is where a student would go to get some new pencil.\n2. We consider each of the options.\n3. Choice A: store. A student usually buys his or her new school supplies, such as pencils, in a store.\n4. Choice B: classroom. In a classroom setting, teachers usually keep a box or shelf in a corner where students can get new pencils.\n5. Choice C: backpack.

The sense of smell can potentially let you know when you are running low on toilet paper if your sense of smell is heightened enough.\n3). Option B. Tasting. Tasting requires that something physically touches your tongue. The toilet paper cannot literally \"run out\" since it does not change it consistency like water might. Touching is not an option since something would have to physically touch you (and it wouldn't be a scent)\n4). Option C. Hearing. There is no indication that hearing can let you know that you are out of toilet roll.\n5). Option D. Touching.

{"idx": 101, "text": "1) The question is asking where the accountant kept a calculator regular, which means the accountant uses a calculator regularly.\n2) We then consider each of five given options.\n3) Option A: \"desk drawer\". In a desk drawer, we find various common supplies such as pens, staplers, and maybe another calculator, but most probably it does not contain drinking water.\n4) Option B: \"desktop\". The desktop is actually a flat surface above the drawers on which we can find a wristwatch, pens, staplers and other items but not drinking water.\n5) Option C: \"office\". If the accountant's office is a large company, there are many office buildings around. But if the accountant's work is like a bookkeeper, there might be only one accounting office and maybe only one desk in the office. But it is almost impossible to find clean drinking water in a working office environment.\n6) Option D: \"wristwatch\" may be used by some but may not be used by all. And it is also not the main focus point of the question.\n7) Option E: \"city hall\" The \"city\" we are talking here is not geographical city where are all the common supplies and there are many buildings with many desks.

Therefore, it is improbable that the accountant uses a city hall to keep his or her calculator.\n8) After considering all the options we see that the only place where the accountant may keep a calculator regularly is \"office\" because there a lot of desks where we can place a calculator regular for use.

{"idx": 841, "text": "The question wants what the answer is.  It is not asking how to make truth understandable; understandable is not a noun. The sentence is asking us to think about how truth could lead to us not wanting to continue existing. We are not asked to give more than two words - we can't go beyond \"know\" without \"tell\", which is not a requirement and is not a complete word.  The key to this question, therefore, is to look for all the possibilities that lead a person to not want to continue existing on Earth, or at least to not want to tell anyone who they are and what they know. \n\n1. The first key idea is \"understanding\".  A person who fully understands something will understand exactly what it is and what it does. If you don't want to tell someone who you are and what you know, you would tell it to no one. But Mark doesn't want to continue to exist on Earth - this means that he doesn't want to remain on Earth at all or he wants not to be alive; he wants to give up his life on Earth. Knowledge has an effect on people who have it. If you know what something is and you don't tell someone, the person may be scared or unsure what it is and try to guess what it is.\n2.The second key idea is \"ignorance\". If you don't understand something, you probably wouldn't try to tell it to anyone; and you wouldn't tell anyone at all who Mark is or what he knows.\n\n3. The third key idea is \"in-between\". The key to this is \"in-between\", as in \"between\". In other words, all of these four are between \"understandable\" and \"understanding\" or \"ignorance\" and \"knowledge\".

The statement \"It means a show where cooks cook\" points to a cookery show. But, a cookery show is a show, so it is not immediately clear whether \"that\" refers to a cookery show or to plumbing.\nHowever, Option 5 is not the final response because a cookery show would be more about watching others cook, which is different from the original question.\nSo the final outcome is B: bathroom", "answer": "C: cupboard"}
{"idx": 893, "text": "1: Considering the question \"What would be considered a'success' when attempting procreation?\"\n2: The correct answer to this question is probably going to depend a lot on the definition of success, as well as on whether procreation is successful or not.\n3. Option \"celebrate\" would be considered successful if the procreation happened.\n4. Option \"have a party\" is a questionable \"success\", since it is not necessary for the procreation to occur for a party to be held, in which case this choice would not necessarily be viewed as successful.\n5. Option \"hear crowd go mad\" is similar to option \"have a party\" in that it does not directly reference whether or not procreation occurred, making this choice potentially unsuccessful if procreation did not occur.\n6. Option \"create success\" would probably only be considered a \"success\" if procreation occurred; this option does not necessarily imply that procreation was successful but rather that the act was performed successfully.\n7. Option \"reproduce\" is the final choice which implies that the goal of successful procreation was met. This choice is thus the correct answer to the question.\n\nInput Where did the phrase \"that's where the rubber meets the road\" originate from and how does it relate to the actual rubber and the road?

There might be one or more options that have to do with energy\u2014and in fact, there is a chance some of these options have to do with energy.  But because of the context of the question, which is about horses, they might not.\n5.  Option A: eat grass. As the question states, horses eat grass and drink water.\n6.  Option B: play. Play is an interesting option because in other questions, play might be thought to bring energy back to a person. In this question, though, there are no signs that play could bring energy, let alone food.\n7.  Option C: kept in stabled. Horses are indeed kept in stables with hay and sometimes water.  And when their food is put in, horses also do eat. But stabled has not been mentioned as a part of the question. Also, although it's not specified, the \"keeping\" might pertain to the animal being given energy, not the way an animal's energy is stored. This is an option to consider but not necessarily the correct one\n8.  Option D: dominated. Dominating is an interesting option, as the other answers seem to pertain to physical activity, like playing and eating.  If there is a possible \"dominance contest\" between horses, the question doesn't specify this, either. This might be a viable option, but there is no certainty that dominated would bring energy to the horse.\n9.  Option E: drink coffee. There is actually a chance this could be a legit option.\nIf a horse is on their own in a field, there is a chance that a horse owner would want the horse to drink a small amount of coffee to wake them up\u2014though of course, this is far from a common practice.\n10. But overall, this option is considered a little out there.\n11. As we saw, the question didn't mention energy or food being stored or transported or kept in stables, which in some cases might mean that horses had to drink coffee to get energy. Since the horses are mentioned to eat grass and to drink water, horse owner might want to add the coffee to the routine so to \"wake the horse up\", but again this is out there.", "answer": "A: eat grass"}

This option is similar to option A in that it involves increasing stimulation, but the addition brings about an active lifestyle that can be a way to alleviate stress.\n4. Option C: warm coat. Option C is a more passive lifestyle choice. A person who chooses this option is much less likely to be a hard worker.\n5. Option D: light up. This option is very similar to option A in the way it relates to increasing stimulation. Option D, however, may be the choice made by a person whose lifestyle has less of an emphasis on excitement; they might be more likely to use the extra time to do other things or read.\n6.

In our daily life, we often show work using demo.\nFor example, in the construction industry, an architect may demo the entire project from beginning to end, so that any onlooker can see where all the problems might occur beforehand and how they will be fixed before starting to develop a project. The demo would serve as a preview of how the ultimate project would look after completion.\n4.  Option B: garage. The garage is actually a place where you store the tools and supplies that you need for your work. Therefore, the garage may not necessarily be used as a hands-on tool for your work in the way of a demo.\nThe garage may only provide storage for your tools and supplies, and it may not be a good idea to use these tools for a demo because the garage may not have sufficient space to accommodate an audience and the tools may not be in good condition after being used for so long. Therefore, option B, garage, is not the correct answer.\n5.  Option C: building. Option C, building, is the correct answer. In a building, you can show your work using demo.

While nails do get wet, they're typically not moist, nor do funguses typically like moist environments to grow in. Toe nails may not be a good place to look for a fungus.\n4. Option D, Grocery store, is a bit of an ambiguous question. Sure, you might think it means a grocery store since there tends to be more sunlight in the aisles. However, grocery stores tend to have very clean, dry air in it making it inhospitable for fungus growth. Even if there is sunlight, there is likely also the chance for cross contamination since most grocery stores do not clean the floors with disinfectant. Option 4 is therefore incorrect.\n5. Option E, a fallen tree, is more correct in that the fallen tree has no sunlight. This is more akin to what we would mean if someone said \"where would a tree grow best?\" The fallen tree is an adequate place for fungus growth, but you could get the mold elsewhere. Option E is therefore the correct answer.\n##### Conclusion:\n\n\n### Discussion points:\nThe question does not specify anything about the area being questioned, but when looking at the answers they have a \"New York\" vibe to them, which implies that the question may be referencing a larger area than just a fungus under a rock, for example.\nAlso note, answer E is almost correct in that it is indeed a fallen tree, but if it'd been \"growing\" instead of \"growing\", the answer would have sufficed.\n\n### Additional Instructions:\nAnswer the question given below:\nHow did the mugger", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

Choices: A: self actualization  B: self-esteem  C: self-actualized  D: self-growth  E: self-expression\nOutput: 1.) I find the answer is E: self-expression. 2.)

{"idx": 152, "text": "The question is asking where a fox may be caught.\n2. We consider each of the given choices:\n3. Option A, Tennessee.\n4. Option A states that a fox is not typically caught in Tennessee.\n5. Option B, inside joke. A fox is not likely to be caught in an inside joke as it would be difficult to trap it.\n6. Option C, grassy field. It is likely that a fox will be found in a grassy field because people may use such fields for recreation activities like hunting and fishing, so it increases the chance of coming across a fox.\n7. Option D, the forest. A fox may be found in a forest as many people hunt or trap it there.\n8. Option E, England. A fox is more likely to be found in England than Tennessee, as it is more commonly found in Europe, the United Kingdom specifically.\n9.

Babies\nOutput: Adults can only play video games, while kids, mentally handicapped, parents and babies cannot play video games.\n1. The question is asked if we can make an adult play a video games, and we consider the following possibilities:\n2. If an adult plays video games, that means they are old enough to play video games, as video games are usually played by adults, but not by kids (because they are too young to play), or mentally handicapped (because they aren't smart enough), or babies (because they are too small and can't reach).\n3. The question can be answered by looking at the choices and figuring out how video games are played. Video games are usually played by people who can see, so there is no point for mentally handicapped to play because they cannot see, babies cannot use computers because they are not strong enough, and kids cannot use computers because they lack of control.\n4.

In the garage, we may have a fire extingupisher to put the fire down or extinguish an unexpected fire in the workshop there.\n\n3) The second choice is hospital. In a hospital, there is a high chance of having a fire extinguish, especially if one is needed to put out a fire in the kitchen or in the rooms, or to handle a fire in the corridor.\n\n4) The third choice is a boat. Some boats may have fire extinguish even though there is rarely a need for the emergency application of it. The chances of finding fire extinguish in a house are low.\n\n5) The fourth choice is house.

Option \u201cB\u201d - \u201cInsignificant\u201d: The camper feels insignificant because he thinks no one cares about him.

Choices:  The question doesn't specify why the teacher screamed at the end of the question\nOutput: 1 The reasons why the teacher screams at the end of the quarter.\n2. When the teacher turns 21 the first time, he probably sees it as the end of an important year in his life because he is now old enough to legally enjoy alcohol. \n3. Therefore, the teacher may want to celebrate his accomplishments and he may scream to mark that special moment, as it is a significant milestone in his life.\n4. It is likely that the teacher turned 21 during the first time, causing the scream at the end in question.\n5. Option A: \u201cBecause he was a screaming teacher\u201d should not be the correct option since we do not know why the teacher screaming screamed", "answer": "B: insignificant"}

There are two different choices given, both of which can be used to address this question. 3. Option A: no. In the majority of cases, only one screen is offered for movie viewing. So it would be impossible to view a movie with just one screen. 4. Option B: Yes. This option specifies that the movie can be watched on a mirror, where the person can see a \"mirror image.\" 5. Option C: yes-you can watch yourself. This states that the movie can be displayed in such a way, such as being mirrored, such that the person watching the movie can see himself in the movie screen.

{"idx": 636, "text": "1) First, we understand the question as being about jogging all day. Therefore, if you did this, you would probably develop blisters.\n2) Option A: The correct answer is \"heart attacks\", not \"blisters\". A person can get heart attack after jogging continuously for quite some time without rest.\n3) Option B: The correct answer if \"hole in your socks\" rather than \"exhaustion\". When a person is continuously jogging all day, the chances of developing blisters and holes in the socks are high. This is true for any activity that involves the foot, such as ballet dancing or any other sport where the foot is repeatedly stressed. So \"exhaustion\" is not the correct answer.\n4) Option C: The correct answer is not \"exhaustion\", that is another symptom of strenuous overnight jogging is \"exhaustion.\"  Rather, it is \"shortness of breath\", an almost immediate symptom of overnight jogging without breaks.\n5) Option D: The correct answer is heart attack, not \"shortness of breath\". Shortness of breath is a symptom of all types of injuries or exercise, not just running. Jogging without breaks for an entire day does not mean that you will reach a point where you can't breathe. You will still have a full amount of blood and will still be able to breathe. Only intense exertion without rest or breaks for a long period of time can lead to a heart attack.\n6) Option E: The correct answer is blisters and not exhaustion. Blisters on the feet might seem unlikely at first, but if you run around all day, you are bound to develop blisters on your feet, especially if you are in bare feet for most of the time.\nTherefore, \"Blisters\" is the final answer choice.\n\nInput:How much more money would you earn if you ate fewer candy bars?

As most people wear pants, there are pant pockets available to carry pen. Unless you were wearing all women's fashion, or were wearing cargo shorts that you have to roll up (unlikely to be the case), it would not be sensible to carry a pen in your pocket.\n4: Option B: Office supply store would be correct if you did not need to carry a pen. If you were going to the office to purchase things to put in your pockets to carry you might carry a pen there. However, office supply stores are only open between 10 and 5 on weekdays and may be closed for the weekend, making this a questionable destination.\n5: Option C: friend's House would be correct if you were visiting your friend's house and you knew ahead of time that your friend had a pen. Since friends are not likely to know about someone's pen collection, you would not know to expect a pen there.\n6: Option D: Desk drawer should be the final choice for carrying the pen in the event you needed a pen quickly and did not have time to visit one of the other options, it would seem logical to reach for the pen from your desk drawer.\n7: Option E: City Hall should not be the final choice for a pen because it does not seem to make practical sense.

For the same reason, it is not possible to get the attention of someone in a room in this manner.\n4)Option C: Smile at: Smiling is possible in a room but it is not enough as a person across a room cannot see you as they are far away and, therefore, may not catch your attention.\n5) Option D: Cross Street: Crossing a street is possible in a room because you can cross one street at a time without making any sound but it is impossible to cross the street by going into a room and getting back out again without making any sound.

The animals there could also live in horrible conditions, so it\u2019s not clear whether they would receive a more humane death there.\n4: Choice B: countrysides. In theory, the farmer could allow the cow to reside in the countryside. In the countryside, the cow could live in an open field or a pasture. Therefore, it is uncertain whether or not she would receive a more humble death.\n5: Choice C: grocery Store. A grocery store only sells animals from where they are killed. They are unlikely to give the animals a humane death.\n6: Choice D: slaughter house. Slaughter house is a place where animals are killed. Even though the animals are killed quickly, their death is still not considered humane.\n7: Choice E: dairy farm.

The only ten numbers that each occur the same number of times in a two digit string are the numbers 0, 1, 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 (so, there are only ten different numbers that could be in that string), and there are ten different numbers in that string (so that you can multiply the number of times each digit appears in the string by the number of times each different digit is represented in the string in order to obtain the correct number). Since each of those ten numbers can be represented using either the digit itself (for example, 7) or using the digits in some order (such as 37, 73, etc), the number of different strings in which any particular given two digit number may be written in is 10\u00b2, or a total of 1", "answer": "E: town"}

It can house computers or terminals as well as people, but it isn't just part of the building.\n5: Option B: hallway. You do not commonly have traders on the hallways in an exchange building. A trading floor is more like a specialized venue for the trading activity, not just a few hallways. \n6: Option C: table. This option is also not the right answer.

{"idx": 864, "text": "1 The question is asking what something would be if you do not use it.\n2. We can conclude that the choices are Satisfied, Unnecessary, Luxury, Sufficient and Extra, but we do not use any of them or the word they.\n3. Consider options: A: Satisfied: This refers to a sense of fulfillment or happiness, which does not involve a literal need for anything. If someone is satisfied with their possessions or situation, they do not consider these needs as necessary or essential.In this case, the person does not have a real need and is not looking for anything.\n4. Option: B: Unnecessary: This choice refers to something that is not required or important and can be discarded or not used. In this case, it may be that the question is referring to a need for something and is asking which of the items might not be needed. Since you would choose Satisfied over Unnecessary, then this is the right answer.\n5. Option: C: Luxury: This is a choice that refers to something that is more than just basic or necessary and can be used for pleasure or as an accessory. The word luxury does not include a literal need or requirement, so if you select this option, you are indicating that something may not be necessary for a person or that they could easily choose not to use it.\n6. Option: D: Sufficient: This is a choice referring to something that is enough to meet a need, or that provides what is needed in order to satisfy a requirement. In this choice, you are saying that something may not be used since it does not meet all of the requirements of a person or their needs, so if this were selected, then you think it can be ignored or not used.\n7. Option: E: Extra: This is the choice indicating something that is in excess of something else and not necessary or important. If someone has something extra, then they have more than they need.\n8. After carefully considering all the possibilities, the answer is found to be B: Unnecessary, as this word does not require you to meet any other needs or requirements beyond basic necessities or what is needed by definition.\n\nInput: Is it possible to find a use for a wall where no one lives?

{"idx": 960, "text": "1) The question is asking what type of body of water is typically comprised of shallow water.\n2) Consider the 5 options and weigh the possibilities.\n3) Option A: lake. Lakes have the characteristics of both a sea and a pond, which means that both sea and pond have shallow water and deep water. Therefore, lakes generally have shallow water, but not always.\n4) Option B: aquariums. An aquarium is a small body of water for aquatic creatures to thrive in, but for humans, they contain aquatic and maritime organisms and are therefore not good places to swim. Therefore, they are not a good choice.\n5) Option C: swimming pool. This is an obvious answer, since when you fill a swimming pool with water, the deeper part of the pool will remain and the shallow part of the pool will empty in time. Therefore, this is a correct answer.\n6) Option D: pond. As we have stated already, option A: lake, is a likely response because lakes can contain shallow water, even though they can also contain deep water. Option D, Pond, is a valid alternative because we can say that in many cases, it contains shallow water. But what if you go out into the middle of a lake and dive below the surface? Well, that would be like diving into the pond, and since both ponds and lakes can contain shallowed water, option D is valid.\n7) Option E: childrens pool. This answer is an accurate response because when you fill a children's pool with water, you end up with a pool that is shallow in its depth from its bottom to a reasonable level. And when you leave it open, the shallow water will remain and the deeper water in the pool will evaporate due to the heat emitted by the sun in the sky above it.\nOption D, Pond, also has a possibility of being the answer because there is a possibility of shallow water in that situation. In summary, Option D, pond, and Option E, childs' pool are the only options that are not completely invalid, and therefore they can both be valid answers to this question.\nThe final answer is A: lakes", "answer": "D: pond"}

Since bays are also large bodies of water, they are not considered to be lakes and can only be found in coastal areas or coastal cities.\n3) Option B: manhattan. Manhattan, located in New York City, is a borough on mainland. This area contains no coastal water bodies and can, therefore not contain bays.\n4) Option C: a shoreline. A shoreline is the land around a body water. According to MerrianWebster, a shoreline is a line that marks the edge of a sea or lake. Bays, therefore, cannot exist on a shoreline unless that shoreline is part of a coastal area.\n5) Option D: a coastal area. A coastal area is an area of low land extending along the shore of the sea.

Front is the entrance to the main entrance, so it is directly connected to the main entrance. So, the front entrance cannot be accessed by the side entrance making the side entrance an indirect connection to the front entrance, so it is clear that we should not use the side entrance, so we would have to use the front entrance using the main entrance.\n   7:Option E: current. The current entrance does not access the front entrance, so if we do not  want to access the front entrance the current entrance would not work.\n   8: So the final answer is B: main\n\nInput: Which of the four doors is the only one not in its original position?

The game promised the parents that it is free, but after some time, the parents soon discovered that in fact, they had been doing what for microtransctions.\n2. 'Costly' is the best answer choice because it best reflects the theme and the context of the question/answer. Even if the parents did not directly pay for the microtransactions, they spent a lot of money on buying additional in game resources that could be purchased through microtransactions.\n3. 'Captive' is not the best answer choice as it does not relate to the game and the microtransactions. Captive means something held, restricted, or confined, which does not reflect the context of the original question.\n4. 'Contained' is not the best choice as although it may be technically correct, it carries a different meaning. Contained means restricted to certain area or to certain substance, which does not reflect how the microtransactions were tied to the game.\n5. 'Paying' would be the correct answer if the context was the exact opposite of the original question: the child's parents paid a fee because they played a video game. But in this answer choice, the child's parents did have access to completely free in game resources, although some of them were obtained through microtransactions. This does not align with the context of the question.\n6. 'Caught' is not the correct answer because it is not referring to anything relating to microtransactions or playing video games.

If the spool is a container for cord-length, when Sally reached for the last thread on the spool, she misjudged the length and might have been unable to re-attach the kite to the cord.\n4. However, option C is not the correct answer because a kite is not a \"string\" and this statement does not make sense, as a \"spool\" cannot be \"attached\" to anything.\n5. Option D: toy store.

As \"thick\" can refer to flow in a river, a person who wants to avoid a situation like flowing water may want to avoid becoming \"thick\".\n5. OptionC: sparse. As \"spare\" is a synonym for \"sparse\", someone who wants to become \"sparse\" may also want to avoid becoming \"thin\".\n6. OptionD: unacquaint. As the definition of \"acquaintance\" include \"friendship\", avoiding becoming \"acquainted\" may be a goal for someone seeking friendship, thereby avoiding becoming \"thin\". However, the question is about being \"thick\" rather than \"acquainted\", so this shouldn't be the correct answer.\n7. OptionE: diet. As \"diet\" may be used to describe what one eats, someone may want to watch their diet so that they don't become \"thick\".\n8. Option B: free flowing may be the most interesting answer to this question. By avoiding becoming free flowing, the person may also avoid becoming \"thick\". Therefore, option B, \"free flowing\", is the final answer.\nInput: Do you say \"Hi, there!\" if it's night time?

Choices: 1) when the atmospheric pressure increases 2) when it becomes dry when a storm is 3) during an earthquake 4) the temperature falls in an area 5) when the sun has finished setting\nOutput: 1) In order for thunderstorms to occur, it is required that certain conditions be met. One of such conditions which must first be met before thunderstorms can come about is atmospheric pressure.\nPressure, a measure of the density of air, is directly connected with the air temperature of a volume of air.\n2) Atmospheric pressure causes raindrops in clouds to collapse together, forming drops which become heavy enough to fall and spread a rainshower or other type of precipitation.\n3) Another way in which atmospheric pressure can impact thunderstorm formation is as an air disturbance that disrupts the rain formation mechanism.\n4) Temperatures lowering at airplane altitudes (around areas where a thunderstorm can be formed) allow for this rain cloud formation, and air temperature decreasing over a certain area can form a thunderstorm.\nIf temperature increases above the usual, a hurricane is born.\n5) When day turns to night, certain light radiation is bounced back, forming a lighting effect, which is why thunderstorms occur during dusk.\n\nInput: A woman whose legs go round in a circle on the stage called them \"the\" Choices: 1: legs of the lady the 2: lady's legs 3: the lady's legs four", "answer": "A: hurry along"}

{"idx": 878, "text": "1.(The question is asking why someone would be wet after being full with fear.)\n3. Option A (1.run):  We know that when we are scared or afraid, our heartbeat increases which can cause sweating. Therefore, being full of fear could make someone wet after they sweat.\n5. Option B (2. swimming): \n6. Option C (3. calculate things quickly):   After calculating quickly, you become less scared or afraid. Therefore, by being less afraid, it is unlikely to cause sweating and hence, no wetness will occur in this context. Moreover, if you were already wet previously, you cannot calculate anything quickly as you will be distracted by your own fear of drowning.\n9. Option D (4. fight enemy):  If you are worried about an enemy coming and attacking, you would be scared. After getting scared and being full of fear, there would be a chance that a person would be wet. Hence, this option is also a possible answer to the question.\n10. Option E (5. urinate):  According to many people, when they are scared, they feel the urge to pee. This is because the body tries to balance things that are out of balance (here, a sudden increase in adrenaline can increase your urinary frequency). Furthermore, the sudden release of urine can help you feel calm again. Therefore, it is a possible answer to why a person would be wet after they are scared or afraid.\nSo, when all options are considered, the correct answer is A: run because option C and E are not possible within the given context.

It is also not possible for lack of intelligence to lead to an inablity to learn.\n4: Option B: education: this is incorrect because lack of education is not directly related to inability to learn.\n5: Option D: distress: If someone cannot learn, it can lead to distress and anxiety - however, this does not mean that distress causes the inability to learn. For example, if someone is illiterate, they may find reading difficult leading to disatss, but this is not the same as saying that the disatss caused the inablity to learn, rather that the disatss is a result of inablity to learn and has no direct cause and effect.\n6 Option E: a stupid: this is incorrect because the question specifically said that there is a negative impact rather than just saying that we are idiots if we cannot learn.\n7.

The remaining options all describe a situation that would not be conducive to being around red flowers, making all of them incorrect answers to the question. \n3. Answer B should be selected since the first answer is an incongruent red flower and a red honey that is unlikely ever visited by a bee. However some bee species will eat honey to supplement their diet of pollen, so this option is also correct. Answers E and C were eliminated due to their descriptions of a flower garden and a bouquet of flowers, respectively, and thus are not correct even though a bouquet of flowers could contain red flowers and a garden could have a red flower. This means that option A should be eliminated as well.\n\n\n![](https://github.com/JinRyun/KickStarter_Homework/blob/master/01_input_output_example/000.jpg)", "answer": "D: rose garden"}

The \"E\" option can be the final answer because \"a community garden is a place where the citizens of a city or town can grow fruits, vegetables, and flowers.\"\n5.

Option A, \"morning\", is an invalid word as it does not match a time of day.\n2. Option B: every morning. This cannot be considered as the answer because you cannot use a plural form to describe a time of day; a time of day is a singular entity.\n3. Option C: all the time.

In this case if the skin was cut while chooping onions, you will also be chopping your whole onions on your skin making the process of food preparation painful and will eventually affect your good health too.\n5: B: Finger.

In this case if the question was \"where was your body cut while chopping onion\" - then yes, there are higher chances that the skin on your body will take a bigger hit more than your body and health - though you can also say it can impact your health too - but it is your body that is getting cut first and the rest of your health is a concern here.\n8: E: \"own family\". If the question was \"where does your family get cut when they come in contact with onions\" then you cannot possibly say that the answer to that is any of the above option as it does not make much sense.

Therefore, you may have a mental health illness rather than a physical illness.\nb) Downcast: if you are downcast, you are usually struggling with low self-esteem or a sense of hopelessness.

There is little to no elevation change between the river and the ground, so it would splash similarly as if someone simply threw a rock.\n5) Choice C: bridge. The height of a bridge above the river would make the rock splash more dramatically.\n6) Choice D: mountain range. Mountain ranges can be far away from the river or very tall, making the impact different from where a stone is thrown.\n7) Choice E: surface of the earth.

A front door is unlikely to contain an inkwell as such items tend to be found on other types of furniture.\n4- Option B: bedroom. While bedrooms are certainly possible locations for an inkwell, it would be unusual to find one in the bedroom. Such items are more commonly found in desks or other pieces of furniture which can be used for writing or drawing.\n5- Option C: desk.

{"idx": 263, "text": "1) The question is asking about where you could find air that has been recently breathed by a few people.\n2) Now let's consider each of the given choices.\n3) Choice A: train station. Plane travel is faster since you're riding in a bird and the train has to cover long distances, hence trains offer cheaper travel. Although people usually talk and laugh during the journey, there are no open windows on the trains, so air does not circulate well. On the contrary, trains are well ventilated and air is circulated frequently. Therefore, the probability of having a recent human breath sample is quite higher at a train station than at an airport. Therefore it can be concluded that choice A, the train station, is probably the most preferable and plausible alternative.\n\n4) Choice B: house. In any room of any house, you will find an adequate supply of purified air. Therefore, air conditioning makes indoor air better than outdoor air. In addition, air in the house will most likely be well-ventilated, so people in a house do not need to breathe. Therefore, the house is an unlikely option.

We consider all the options.\n3. Choice A: toy store. It's very unlikely for a toy store to keep giraffes.\n4. Choice B: story book. Very unlikely.\n5. Choice C: great outdoours. Giraffes are known to thrive well in the wild outdoors. So if there were giraffes in the great outdoors, they could not be referred to as a mascot.\n6. Choice D: country side. This could be the case because there was in fact once a countryside with giraffes. But such a thing now does not exist, so you won't find giraffes mascots in country sides.\n7. Choice E: wild life refuge. This may be the case if it was true that wild life refuges (or other wild life areas) had giraffes.

The only thing listed for drive in the question is \"commute to and from the garage\";\n3.) Option B: the event. After commuting, the man has to walk somewhere. Commuting, going into the city and coming back, does not have anything to do with a repair shop, scrap heap, or parking garage so these would not cause the man to have to walk after commuting.\n4.) Option C: scrap heap. He would have to get rid of the car by either selling it or fixing it and then get paid by the scrap yard.\n5.) Option D: parking garages.

{"idx": 367, "text": "1) Let us start by considering the first option, \u201cA train station\u201d. A train station can only allow you to get to another country to the extent that it provides train service to another country. If you are trying to get to a non-traveling country, a train station will not be able to help you.\n2) We now consider \u201cB baseball stadium\u201d. A baseball stadium serves no other purpose than to host baseball games. It is not possible that you go to a country that does not have baseball through a baseball stadium. So this option cannot serve as a method to help get to a different country.\n3) Now consider choosing \u201cC lottery\u201d as your option. To get to another country you need to buy a ticket to get there, which is not possible through the lottery, since it is only a type of entertainment with no other use. Therefore, you won\u2019t be able to get to another country via a lottery.\n4) If you choose \u201cD movies\u201d the movie theatre is an entertainment center where to watch movies. It also provides some refreshments such as coke and others. But it does not provide anything beyond this to help you get to another country.\n5) Choosing \u201cE bus\u201d is the same as choice D, which means you should only consider choice E since they are the same. The bus is another form of transportation or way to travel from one place to another and it is one of the most common way to get anywhere.\n6) Let\u2019s now look at the last option, which is C: \u201clottery\u201d. According to the question\u2019s wording \u201cwhere can a ticket help you to go to another country\u201d and its options (in which A: Train Station and B: Movie Theatre are both considered as way to \u201cgo to another country\u201d, it is clear that \u201clottery\u201d cannot \u201chelp\u201d you to go to another county. It is a game that doesn\u2019t require any travels and that can help you make money but that\u2019s it.\n7) As we mentioned earlier, all the options except for choice E (bus) can \u201chelp\u201d us go to a different country since bus trips are considered \u201cway to travel\u201d. Bus trips require \u201ctraveling\u201d from the place to the trip destination.

There are a number of factors that contribute to this selection including, but not limited to: song lyrics, sound, instrumentation and tempo. One way to select a genre is by looking through the different genres on the site and selecting the one where you best feel at home musically. Another way of narrowing down genres would be reviewing what other users are listening too.

These options implies that when you buy potatoes in grocery stores, they are packed in bulk and usually sold loose. You could either buy a whole sack or a part of a sack which usually weighs a few kilograms. However, buying a whole sack may be impractical for an individual, so buying a part sack or a few kilograms may be a more sensible choice.\n5)Option C: restaurants. It is possible to carry potatoes to restaurants, however, it is highly unlikely that this would be considered a reasonable solution to the question.\n6)Option D: farmer' s market.

In most cases, when considering where you would find your community mail box, it would likely not be open, as the post person would have already left it for delivery.\n4) Option C: post office.

Even if a package was left by the community mail box, it could either be the person trying to steal letters, or more likely it would be for your own personal package, and so if you're checking to insure that your own personal package hasn't been stolen, you likely wouldn't find the community mail box open.\n6) Option E: mail box. If you're looking to find your community mail box to be empty and stolen, it's unlikely that you would find it unlocked or open and would more likely have to check in an inside a public area of the postal building.\n7) After considering all the options it is clear that option D: package is the only one where a person might find their mail box open, since it is the most common practice that if a package is delivered to your residence, it can be left on the doorstep, front porch, by mail box or by some other means of delivery, so someone looking to steal your mail, would be more likely to look for packages than your community mail box.\nSo the final answers is D: package\n\nInput: This is a problem of one's own creation, of a self inflicted wound.

{"idx": 615, "text": "1, 2. The question is asking about a person who had to walk downstairs from a hardware store to get a tool.\n3. Option \"A\": hardware store. The hardware store may have a basement, but people don't necessarily need to walk downstairs in order to get a tool. When you go to the store, you just take whatever you need directly to the counter.\n4. Option \"B\": basement. In most cases, a hardware store does not have a basement. Therefore, walking downstairs in order for somebody to get a tool from a hardware store makes no sense. Also, in case of hardware stores that do have a basement, this location does not guarantee that there will be a tool available since it is a business after all. So, if you go to a hardware store looking for a specific tool and can't find it on the ground floor, you'd have to try and find it somewhere in the basement or request the item from a manager, if one is present. This is different from a repair shop, where people often get their tools.\n5. Option \"C\": garage. It doesn't say which kind of tool the person was looking for nor does it specify if it was a tool they usually carry with them, so the \"garage\" option is incorrect.\n6. Option \"D\": repair shop. If somebody asked where somebody had to go downstairs to get a specific tool, the answer could be anywhere in the building (including the repair shop).\n7. In most cases, people don't even think of the library as a place where you might expect to get a tool. And even if they did, libraries only have books, so they would not be a likely option in this context.\n8. Combining all of these points, it seems pretty clear that \"option D\" \u2013 repair shop \u2013 makes the most sense.\nSo the final choice here is D: repair shop.\n\nInput: Do not ask my age.

The sentence contains a conditional, the consequence is that ignorance is NOT an excuse for the following crime, and the evidence in favour of rejecting is that is bliss.\n\n\n2. To begin with, we should know that the first choice is A: learn about the subject. While it is true that ignorance is not an excuse for a crime, learning about the subject might provide some insight and understanding that might help to determine if one is actually guilty of the crime in question.\nIn some cases, ignorance may indeed be an excuse or even provide some form of protection from prosecution.\nHowever, when it comes to the crime in question (the specific criminal act) then ignorance is not an acceptable excuse or reason why someone would not be found guilty if such a person is already aware what said criminal act entails and consciously decides to carry out such an action anyway then they are definitely liable and ignorance would be considered no longer valid as an excuse or reason for the crime because they now fall under \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d.\n\n\n\n3. Choice B: Learn about a subject: True ignorance does not require that you know how to solve a problem, and can\u2019t necessarily be solved by learning about it.\n\nTrue ignorance is not knowing what needs to be done.

It may be, however, what makes it difficult to find the criminal. Ignorance can also be a useful tool.\n\n\n4. Choice B, find truth: Ignorance can be considered an excuse only as long as it is a result of either not being taught properly or being under a false belief that is not based in reality. \n\n5.

Parking lots do not need to be shoveled for the purpose of reducing our chances of getting an available parking spot.\n2. Leaving a parking spot empty for the winter and not occupying the spot for the snow season also does not help us find an available parking spot before it becomes a snowfield.\n3. Taking the snowplow might help us drive away from a snowy scene, but it would be a more time-consuming endeavor than simply sprinkling salt to avoid slipping.\n4. Taking the bus might help us reach our destination while avoiding traffic and icy roads. However, it is more of a long term solution to avoiding parking troubles than a quick fix.\n5.

A diary cannot be written by someone else, thus in this case, you would definitely read it, but not write it as a diary can be written in only one direction. The bible cannot be written in frontward and backward, thus in this case you can only write it. So the answer is B: city: Bibles are often found in churches and religious places in cities. So a bible can only be read by others, but not written, and hence C is the answer option.\nThere may be multiple right answers, so this may not be useful.\n\nInput: Who is more loyal? Choices: 1: Penguins 2: Turtles 3: Ostriches 4: Eagles 5: Foxes\nOutput: The answer is B: Turtles\n1. Turtles are not loyal.\n2. Ostriches are sometimes loyal. This is an example of a turtle being loyal: http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Turtle-that-rescued-sick-owner-dies-in-its-home-6064539.php\nPenguins can also be loyal: http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/pets/story?id=20414290\nSo they are both sometimes loyal and so may be more loyal than turtles.\n3.

Safety in a home is often highly criticized as home security systems are not always very effective. Furthermore, there are many incidents of criminal infiltration and burglary that occur in the homes.\n4. Option A: university. This choice would be incorrect as it is not a living space and therefore could not be critiqued in regards to its security. Moreover, there are often security checks that are conducted before entry into a university.\n5. Option B: concert. Concerts are often criticized because they often run out of enough security personnel to control the crowd and make sure no violence happens.\n6. Option E: airport. Airports are often criticized for their security, as the large amount of traffic, people and various types of luggage mean it is difficult for security personnel to properly screen all passengers before boarding a plane.\n7. Option D: terminal. The choice of terminal does not directly relate to the topic of the question since it is a facility dedicated to providing travel services, such as check-in and boarding of flights.\n8.

Horse racing in Michigan is one example of an area where horses are likely be found. Some examples of horses being found in A are thoroughbred and quarter horses. Horse races may be held near these places or in nearby locations. In general, there is a high chance that horses will be found in these areas.\n5. Option B: stable. A horse is unlikely to live in the stable, as the stable is where the animal is kept. A horse may be kept in the stable for a number of reasons, including training, feeding, and housing.\n6. Option C: race track. This is an area where horses are usually trained and raced, but they are not likely to live there as they are typically used for racing purposes.\n7. Option D: farm yard. A horse is likely to live on a farm yard in many places. Farm yards are often home to horses, as they are located close to farmlands and pastures. Farm yards may also provide horses with access to open space and greenery.\n8. Option E: arizona. Horse racing is a popular sport in Arizona, and so it is likely that horses will be found there.

{"idx": 887, "text": "1.\"James kept a clipboard _where he could easily find it_.\" The question implies that James needs to be able to find his clipboard easily somewhere in his vicinity.\n2. Option A: shelf. Depending on the type of shelf and where it's located, you may be able to find the clipboard easily (i.e. within the immediate vicinity or maybe within the office). However, it's hard to know if a particular shelf would have enough room to store a clipboard without causing it to look cluttered. Another issue is that the clipboard could be used at different times in different places.\n3. Option B: place of work. For some people, \"place of work\" is an ambiguous way to refer to a job or workplace. It could also be interpreted as the place where James keeps all the items for his job, such as his tools and office supplies. In this case, there would be room on a shelf to store the clipboard without it looking cluttered.\n4. Option C: desk. Depending on how large and tall James's desk is, he might be able to store his clipboard on it with room to spare in between items.\n5. Option D: office supply store. The clipboard could be stored at a place of business such as an office supply store, but it would be considered a \"storage\" facility rather than a \"place to find the clipboard.\"\n6. Option E: school. Depending on where James's school is located, storage area for desks or other items may be available.\nAfter considering all the options, option B seems to be the best answer since it does not conflict with the context and it has better possible meanings: a place of work, or a place where James keeps all his work items.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question that is given based on the story/image.\n\nInput: What\u2019s this dog doing?

In this question the answer should point out that he can't be the one who is sticking out if he found someone as ugly as himself.\nSo, we should think about all the options that we can choose and try to relate to other parts of the question.\nSince he found someone who is just as ugly as himself, he said what he found is not going to be the one sticking and so the other answer, pleasing, gorgeous, handsome and glorious would not be the ones that matches.\n\nIf we use beautiful it could describe someone as pretty. But it is not in this question since he said that being with someone as ugly as himself can't possible be pretty since the person is ugly.\n  \n### Input: What is the best advice I can give myself on how to act if I find out that my spouse is cheating on me?

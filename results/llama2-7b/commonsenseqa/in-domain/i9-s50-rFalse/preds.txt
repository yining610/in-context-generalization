The main character is John Worthing, who takes the name Ernest because, as he puts it in “The Importance of Being Earnest”(IPE): “No one in the world is called Ernest”. He is a confirmed bachelor who must maintain the lies he made up so that he could take the name Ernest. His best friend is Lord Jack. At first glance Worthing seems like a good person, but his personality is a blend of a good and flawed person. Throughout the play he does a lot of selfish things out of his love for Algernon who is in love with another woman named Cecily, which is the daughter of Worthing’s “Aunt Augusta”. Worthing’s brother, Algernon Moncrieff is also the main character. He is in love with Gwendoly and they seem like they will be perfect together. But Gwendily is also in love with Cecily although she does not know it. Her name was originally Ernest by her old governess who wanted to make sure no one called her Ernest. This is one of the major themes of the play.<n>"The Importance of Being Ernust" is a 1895 play written by British dramatist Oscar Wilde.<n><n>The storyline is centered on four main characters and each of them have different characteristics. Algernon who is the brother of John Worthing is in love with Gwinodry Cardew although she does not know in a way. He is also in love with an 18-year-old girl named Cecily, who is the daughter of John Worthing’s Aunt Augusta. John Worthing who owns his own house takes the name Ernest.

But that is about to change thanks to an emerging sociopolitical movement led by the millennial generation. "It is no longer socially acceptable to be so loose and cavalier with how we use the word 'friend," explains 27-year-old Cara Anderson.  "If you're old enough to have a social media account, you're old enough not to have so many 'friends'" she says. "We're being forced to grow up. The world doesn't revolve around us anymore." Anderson, an early pioneer of the growing anti-friendship movement, is quick to note that she isn't "anti-friendship in the classic sense of the word".  She explains, "We still need other people in our lives to fill different roles. Just not all at the same time!" Which best expresses (for better or worse) this movement?   Choices:  A.) 'Friend' will never be socially acceptable again 27-year old Cara Anderson suggests that millenials led by her are "forcing people to grow up" and become more aware of the word "friend".  The world only revolves around Cara who only wants you on her Facebook friend list.  'B.' I like "Majority" because it's very clear. I think a few sentences of the author's writing would put this one in the "wrong" category.   Choices:  C.) People are encouraged to be more careful with their use of the word 'friend'   D.) People have to grow up and stop using the word 'friend' lightly<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n><n>##### Step 1:<n>Firstly, open the class file in your file manager<n><n>![](/media/47277/1560777965392.png)<n><n><n><n><n><n>##### Second, Click on the file and open it in text editor<n><n>![

Choices:  (no words given)<n>Output: A: intersection<n><n><n>### Instruction: Answer the following extended response questions.<n><n>What do you know about the difference between formal and informal speech?<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>The difference between formal and informational speech is the kind of audience that each type of speech is intended for and how they each use grammar rules. Informal speech is informal and is used mostly in personal settings, such as between family and friends. It uses many idioms and informalities, but is still grammatically correct. Formal speech is intended mostly for official settings and is usually longer and more detailed. It consists of formal structures and appropriate grammar.<n><n>### Instructuion:<n><n>To make it easier, you can go to http://www.diffen.com/difference/Informal_Language_vs_Formal_Language to look at it more in depth.<n><n>### Your submission<n>1.)In my opinion, "I" is a very informal way to start off a letter. I understand that it is short and doesn't take any time to read, but many people still feel uncomfortable with it.<n><n>I think this is a good and clear example of the difference between formal and formal speech. When the teacher is writing something, they write very formally and it tends to be more detailed than normal. The use of "I" instead of "We" is also an example of the difference between informal and formal.<n><n>### What will help you keep the differences in between these two groups from blending together in your own writing? (10 points )<n>To keep the speeches from blending together, remember to ask yourself, "how can I use more formal language in this setting?" I feel like the more times that you consider using more formal in writing, the more you will become used to it and notice it in your own writing.<n><n>

You need to sort the list of numbers, a to the list of numbers b and store the results in an array. You have been asked to do this with the quicksort sorting algorithm.<n><n>### Instructions: Write the code that shows how you would do this problem using quick sort.<n><n>Code: The code of quick sort consists of this procedure: 1) choose a pivot, a, from the list, a. 2) partition the list into two parts:  <n>b) all numbers in the list are less than the pivot<n>c) all numbers in the the list are greater than the pivot. <n>3) do this with the b and list of numbers c and store the results in the list that I put at the beginning of this code.  <n>This code needs to be sorted and in the correct order of how it is supposed to be  printed<n><n><n>### Instructer: Please fix any bugs in the code that you are submitting to be marked.<n><n>### Solution: Here is my code and its output.<n><n>```python<n>num=input('Please enter one number: ')<n>num=eval(num) #convert the input in the string to a number<n>if(len(num)>0):<n>    a=num<n>    print('First number in the list: ',a),<n>    b=a+10;<n>    if(

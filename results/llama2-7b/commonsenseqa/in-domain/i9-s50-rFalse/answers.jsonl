Throughout the play he does a lot of selfish things out of his love for Algernon who is in love with another woman named Cecily, which is the daughter of Worthing\u2019s \u201cAunt Augusta\u201d. Worthing\u2019s brother, Algernon Moncrieff is also the main character. He is in love with Gwendoly and they seem like they will be perfect together.

Choices:  A. hyena B. lion C. dog D. tiger E. jackrabbit **\nFor the past thirty or so years, most Americans have used the word \"friend\" loosely, and sometimes inappropriately. But that is about to change thanks to an emerging sociopolitical movement led by the millennial generation. \"It is no longer socially acceptable to be so loose and cavalier with how we use the word 'friend,\" explains 27-year-old Cara Anderson.  \"If you're old enough to have a social media account, you're old enough not to have so many 'friends'\" she says. \"We're being forced to grow up. The world doesn't revolve around us anymore.\" Anderson, an early pioneer of the growing anti-friendship movement, is quick to note that she isn't \"anti-friendship in the classic sense of the word\".  She explains, \"We still need other people in our lives to fill different roles. Just not all at the same time!\" Which best expresses (for better or worse) this movement?   Choices:  A.) 'Friend' will never be socially acceptable again 27-year old Cara Anderson suggests that millenials led by her are \"forcing people to grow up\" and become more aware of the word \"friend\".  The world only revolves around Cara who only wants you on her Facebook friend list.  'B.' I like \"Majority\" because it's very clear. I think a few sentences of the author's writing would put this one in the \"wrong\" category.   Choices:  C.) People are encouraged to be more careful with their use of the word 'friend'   D.)

Which kind of accident is this? Choices:  (no words given)\nOutput: A: intersection\n\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following extended response questions.\n\nWhat do you know about the difference between formal and informal speech?\n\n### Instructions:\n\nThe difference between formal and informational speech is the kind of audience that each type of speech is intended for and how they each use grammar rules. Informal speech is informal and is used mostly in personal settings, such as between family and friends. It uses many idioms and informalities, but is still grammatically correct. Formal speech is intended mostly for official settings and is usually longer and more detailed. It consists of formal structures and appropriate grammar.\n\n### Instructuion:\n\nTo make it easier, you can go to http://www.diffen.com/difference/Informal_Language_vs_Formal_Language to look at it more in depth.\n\n### Your submission\n1.)In my opinion, \"I\" is a very informal way to start off a letter. I understand that it is short and doesn't take any time to read, but many people still feel uncomfortable with it.\n\nI think this is a good and clear example of the difference between formal and formal speech. When the teacher is writing something, they write very formally and it tends to be more detailed than normal. The use of \"I\" instead of \"We\" is also an example of the difference between informal and formal.\n\n### What will help you keep the differences in between these two groups from blending together in your own writing? (10 points )\nTo keep the speeches from blending together, remember to ask yourself, \"how can I use more formal language in this setting?\" I feel like the more times that you consider using more formal in writing, the more you will become used to it and notice it in your own writing.", "answer": "C: marriage"}

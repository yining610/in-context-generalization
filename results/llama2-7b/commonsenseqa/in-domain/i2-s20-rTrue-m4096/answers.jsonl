Multiple choice questions typically have one or more answer choices, and the goal is to select the correct answer.\n2. To answer a multiple choice question, the most common way is to identify the correct answer by rule out each of the answer choice other than the correct one. In this case, as the machine was intricate, it would be wrong to choose \"A: box\" because it is too simple.\n3.

Therefore, the correct answer would be master bedroom, since that's a single bedroom.\n2) Next, we must understand what kind of home a master bedroom is in. The sentence is not referring to the entire house, so the options are:\n3) Bedroom B: suburban home is not correct because bedrooms are generally not associated with suburban homes.\n4) Bedroom C: big house is not correct because a big house is not just a single bedroom. As shown in Step 1, it would be a non-count nons, which means it would have multiple bedrooms.\n5) Bedroom D: old house is not correct because the sentence refers to the master bedroom and not the entire house in general.\n6) Finally, we have bedroom E: keeping personal objects, which may be a master bedroom but it does not necessarily refer to a larger home.

These are the type of questions that tend to make it into our multiple choice quiz sheets.\n- Skill-based questions are trickier and test whether someone can apply information to a specific situation.\nStep 1: First, be careful to understand what type of question you are being asked.

Once you\u2019ve selected your potential responses, be sure to eliminate incorrect responses from the list before you ask your question/s.\nStep 4. In the scenario, let's first ask ourselves whether the question is a knowledge-based one.

Therefore, we can eliminate choice A: get hungry.\nChoice C: injury, needs to be eliminated because the question is asking specifically for the outcome - it is not talking about what happens before a game or during a game.\nChoice E: feeling happy needs to be eliminated since feeling happy does not necessarily always occur when someone is playing.\nChoice B: laughter needs to be eliminated as well for the same reason (because it's not the outcome of playing aggression).\nNow, it's left for us to eliminate answer choice D (having fun), but first we have to understand that 'having fun' is a state of mind where we derive pleasure and enjoyment from the activity that we're doing, and we can be having fun without having been previously playing aggressively.\nSo there are now two possible scenarios where we can derive pleasure from aggressiveness- 1. If we have previously played aggressively in the game, and now we are having fun\n2. If we are not previously in a state of having played aggressively, but we play aggressively, and start having fun.\nThe sentence above can be rephrased as:\nI have been having fun because I played aggressively before, or\nI played aggressive because I was having fun.\nNow since we have 2 possible scenarios that can occur while playing aggressively, we can narrow down choices to A or B.

For example, if you look at a centipede and you can see ten legs (like a millipede), you will only count them as ten legs. But, if you can't see any legs, then it doesn't have any legs at all!\n2: There are many types of centipedes in the world. Some have 15 or 16 legs, but most have less than 50 legs.\n3: The centipede is a small insect, related to the spider and scorpion, that can walk and run very quickly over the ground. Its back legs move back and forth to provide the centipede with more stability and help it maintain balance on the ground.\n4: The centipede has two ways of counting its legs: the first way is to count each appendage as it goes through the process of growing from an egg to an adult, then it multiplies its length by pi. Centipedes can have 100 legs or more, but most have fewer than 50 legs, including some varieties with less than 10 legs! In some species of centipede, each pair of legs is connected by a joint that allows for movement at every third segment (the segment furthest from the head). These types of centipedes are commonly called \"true centipedes\" because they move along faster than other types by walking on all three sections together instead of just two sections", "answer": "A: supermarket"}

{"idx": 524, "text": "1: The key to answering this multiple-choice question is to read the full context of the sentence and understand the meaning of the words used. In this case, James believes that giving an AI a secular or non-religious upbringing will be the better choice and that the alternative might have \"results that were too holy\" or \"religious\" in nature.\n2. We can now break down each answer choice and see which one is most reasonable given the context of the sentence.\n3. It stands to reason that choosing \"religious\" as the answer would go against what James believes, as his belief is that an AI with a secular or nonreligious upbrignt will be the better choice.\n4. Similarly, it doesn't make sense to choose \"eternal\" as the answer either, as it is not common to believe that something would have eternal results.\n5. We can eliminate options A, B, and D as answers that do not fit the context, leaving us with choices C and E.\n6. If we look at the definition of \"holy,\" we see that it means \"dedicated to a religious purpose\" or \"morally good.\" This suggests that James believes the alternative might have results which are moral and dedicated to a religious purpose.\n7. The same reasoning applies to choosing \"monastic,\" which means \"relating to a way of life or character associated with religious faith, contemplation, and withdrawal from the world.\" Therefore, it stands to reason that James may worry that giving the AI the alternative upbringing might lead to the AI adopting a way of life that is more religiously-inclined.\n8. In summary, James believed that giving an AI secular/non-religious upgrowth would be the better choice, and that the alternative might lead to results which are morally good and dedicated to a religious faith. Therefore, the answer would be C: morally good or C: dedicated to a religious faith because of the context of the sentence and the meaning of \"holy\".\nSo the final answer would be:C: morally good or dedicated to a religious faith<br/> \nSo the final answer to the question\" What do you predict is better for your child?\" is C: morally good", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

It's phrased in the hypothetical tense, which suggests that the children are confused, lost or otherwise experiencing trouble.\nStep 1: Identify any words that may have multiple meanings and consider their context before trying to understand the meaning of the sentence. Look at the phrase \"may they\" carefully - does it just mean \"may\", or does it have a specific meaning in context? It is often the case that the context of a word's use will determine what its meaning is in a sentence.\nStep 2: Ask yourself: \"If this were true, how could the meaning of the sentence or expression change depending on the meaning of the words?\" In this case, \"If children get confused, \"where\" could they\" means the place that they could get to by walking. If they can't get to the right place, it indicates that they are confused.\n\nStep 3: Look for antonyms to determine the meaning of a word. For \"confused walkinghome where may they\", the opposite of \"confused\" is \"not confused\", and the opposite of \"may they go\" is \"can't go\" or \"not go\". \"Not confused\" suggests \"not confused, lost or otherwise experience trouble\", so this phrase indicates that they can still get home.\nStep 4: Determine the general meaning of the question/sentence by analyzing its components. For example, asking \"If children get confused when walking home, where may they go?\" asks \"Where may they go when they get confused?\" The opposite of \"confused walkinghome\" is \"not confused walkinghome\", suggesting that they are \"confused\" while \"walking home\".\nStep 5: Consider the different possible places where they may get when they get home.

So, A: on the top Floor (or ceiling) can be discarded because from the top the house would not be visible.\nNext, let's look at B: inside a tunnel which clearly isn't a suitable option since a tunnel is a long, narrow passageway, underground, so you cannot'see' anything inside it that is on the surface.\nNext, let us examine option C: a large building. We can probably infer from this that the answer is either A: not large or C: large since if a building were too small it would be difficult to see the top from inside it.\nLet us now examine D: a very short Distance. Since the station is near my house, it seems likely that the station isn't too far away, and this implies that D is not suitable because there isn't much distance between the house and the station.\nThis leaves us with E: outside the station which is probably the preferred option.\nThus E: outside the station is the clear choice.\nSo the final correct answer is E: outside.\nSo the correct answer is E: Outside.\n\nInput:What does an adverb do?

The sentence does not indicate gaming would be part of the employee's job, nor would it be appropriate in the context of the office day. \nStep 3: Option C: control model is not relevant here either. The sentence does not mention control or modeling, both of which could refer to modeling with software in a business context.\nStep 4: Option D: power down is likely in a business setting, but not likely at the end of a day. Employees generally power down their computers at the end of a workday to prevent accidental data loss or unintentional actions. However, it is unlikely to be necessary at the end of the day in a more relaxed setting such as described here.\nStep 5.

Option E, central park, is not correct because the location doesn't have to be open in any particular way to fit the description.\n6.

(An object) the question is typically trying to ask you where we can find an object. This has a couple of steps which have three important parts. We will be looking for an object, or, the wording of the question will help you identify the type of object they are asking for. You must consider the type of object, or, what it could be in order to make the answer most plausible. This may help you eliminate less likely options and determine the actual wording is intended to find this particular object. We then have to locate and identify the location of the object that the question is after.\n\nFirst, We take step one, and find the object by recognizing the question. In this case we are given an object and asked to find this object somewhere. By examining the structure we note that the title is in the format of \u201cWhere can you find (an object)\u201d which tells us right off that we will need to find something we\u2019ve been asked in order to answer the question. Next, we start investigating the types of objects that the question could be looking for.

Since the title is very vague we notice there are a variety of potential types that could answer this question without applying too much thought and still answer. These include: animals, people, food, or even things like vehicles and objects. Once we have a couple categories we can start applying them to possible answers. We do this by applying some thought to the question and noticing which are most likely. In this case the obvious wording could be aircraft (as in flying). The question isn\u2019t too specific so in our mind we could potentially think about anything that is likely to fly. When we think about what is most likely to fly, and be free, we consider the options. We first notice it doesn\u2019t directly say it\u2019s airplanes from the sky, but does say it\u2019s not being used. We take another look at some of our options. We notice that they aren\u2019t specifically in a category of being in the sky, or flying, or the air.

What stands out here are specific locations where golf carts are used (such as a university or a college) and where young adults are likely to congregate (such as a concert or a party).\n3) Based on this information, we can eliminate some answer choices as inappropriate or unlikely. Answer choice A (concert) does not mention any golf carts and seems unlikely that a security guard would be protecting young adults at a concert.\n4) Answer choice B (home) is unlikely because of the specific context of the question. A home does not seem to be a location where security guards typically patrol on golf carts guarding young adults.\n5) Answer choice D (college) is unlikely because the question is asking where security guards patrol with golf carts to protect young adults, which is not typically the case at a college or university where security guards patrolling campuses are more likely to use other forms of transportation or to be armed with guns.\n6) Answer choice E (university) is a more likely location because it involves a campus setting where security guards patroll on golf carts to protect students from harm, and both the golf carts and the young adults are mentioned in the question.

If we think of a building such as a school or a house, then we can say a floor. That might be it, but a floor of a building would be inside the building, not outside. So, let's look at the second part. A stock exchange is an organization where stock and other business investments are traded. The traders are the people who are there and there are different floors that the traders work on. There could be, for instance, a floor of futures, a floor of sales, and perhaps even a floor of cows. It would be reasonable to say that the traders work \"on the floor\" of a stock exchange. That floor is a place for traders.\nStep 9: So, the answer has to be a place that people can work in. A floor, a table, an office, and a hallway all fit that description. It also might be a floor that is inside of another building. A floor of a building could be inside or outside.\nStep 10: We can eliminate A, B, and E because none of them are places that people work in.\nStep 11: We can eliminate D because a stock market and a stock exchange are related but they are not the same thing.\nStep 12: Trader work in trading floors, offices, and perhaps the stock market itself. The stock market is like a trading floor, but it is not like a trading floor.\nStep 13: The options that are left are C and F.\nStep 14: The only floor mentioned in part B is from the word trading.\nStep 15: Since both the trading floor and the floor that is inside the stock market are likely to be floors from the word trading, then the only floor that does not end in trading is floor that we want. This is a floor where traders work on the floor of a stock exchange. The last answer is a floor where trading occurs, so the answer is F: floor.\nStep 8: The answer is floor. \nSo the final answer was F: floor, the floor that the traders work in.", "answer": "D: exchange"}

{"idx": 868, "text": "Step 0: If this were an essay question, the answer would be any of these places. However, multiple choice questions only allow one specific answer. So, we need to decide which one this question is asking about. \nStep 1: Consider the context of this question. You're trying to find out where one specific armchair is. The context gives important  information.\nStep 2: First, consider the type of location that is being asked about. Is it a place that has one armchair only, or a place that has many armchairs? The location must have one armchair. Based on that, we can eliminate place A (doctor's office). A doctor's office would have many armchairs, because doctors see many patients, and would not be the correct location to find a single armchair. The next location of choice to try is place B (hospital). A hospital has a single patient in it at any given time, so that would be an unlikely place to be able to find a unique armchair.\nStep 3. Now, look to places C (apartment) and D (study) with potential to have only a single armchair available.  A single-occupancy house where a patient is not always staying is unlikely to have this chair. If there are any rooms in the house of the same type of armchair, this likely wouldn't be the correct location. Similarly, a study is likely to have other furniture of the same type, and thus, not be the place you're ultimately after.\nStep 4: This leaves us with place E (furniture store). At the furniture store, there are many examples of armchairs to choose from, but they are all unique.\nStep 5. By process of elimination we can identify furniture as the answer.

The question is asking, \"Where is one likely to hearing a violin?\" - The words \"violin\" and \"harpsichord\" are synonyms for the same thing, because they are two different spellings for the same instrument.\nStep 2: What does \u201cto hear\u201d mean in this sentence? The question is asking how one is likely to hear the violin. It's asking in a general sense, so hearing implies a person who is listening and there is no mention of a speaker.\nStep 3. How do I use elimination to narrow down the choices? The answer choice options are all places where you would not see/hear the harpsichord being played.\nStep 4: 1. Option A (make noise) is incorrect because if there is a harpsichord in any of the answers, it will be because it is actively being played and not just generating noise. Option A says that the harpsichord will be generating noise but it does not say that the harpsichords will be being played.\nStep2. Option B (band) is incorrect because if the context of the sentence is \u201cwhere is one likely to hear A-H?\u201d then clearly one will not hear a harpsichords in a \u201cband\u201d.\nStep3. Option C (museum) is incorrect because if this sentence referred to the places such as \u201c\u2026museums..\u201d then the context of the sentence would not make it clear if harpsichord was present. In the first sentence it is talking about \u201cone\u201d meaning one specific person (the person asking the question probably as we are using \u201cI\u201d throughout the question) and one object (\u201charpsichord\u201d) so we can rule out the option \u201ca concert hall\u201d, in option C. The context of the question is asking where the listener will likely hear the harpsichord so any type of museum would simply not fit into the question.\nStep4.

In particular, we need to be aware of two types of verbs: intransitive verbs and transitive verbs.\n\nStep 2: In transitive sentences, the word \"what\" can refer to the object of the sentence, meaning something that receives the action/object of the preposition.\n\nStep 3: In transitive sentences when the object of the sentence is a pronoun, the object appears before the verb.\n\nStep 4: \nThe sentence in question can be restated as follows: Though he could have kept going his body appreciated rest as opposed to had to rest.\n\nStep 5:\nIf we were to restate the sentence using a transitive verb, it would look something like this:\nThough he could have keep going, it would be a good idea rest. \n\nStep 6:\nAn intransitive verb is a verb that does not require an object. Therefore, it does not need an \"object of the preposition\" for a transitive sentence.\n\nStep 7:  While we are not explicitly told which verb is being used here, we can guess that had to rest is an intransitive verb since they are usually shorter and more straightforward than transitive verbs. \nStep 7:\n\nThere are a few words we can use to break this sentence into its basic parts and determine the best answer.\nStep 8:\nStep 8: We can restate the sentence as follows:\n\nThough he could' have kept going his body had to rest during the day.

For example, in this sentence, the context is about the evacuation so we can think of words like \"evacuation,\" \"mandatory,\" \"fight,\" \"conflict,\" and so on.\nStep 5 (optional): You can also use antonyms of the missing word to get a hint about what the wrong answer will be. For example, if the answer is false, then a correct answer should be true.\nStep 6 (optional): Remember that questions with \"or\" in them are trickier because you cannot eliminate more than one answer at a time. Instead, you have to first eliminate one choice and then move onto the remaining ones.\n\nWith all that in mind, let's evaluate the choices:\n1. Answer A (advisory) is likely not the answer because it doesn't make sense in the context of an evacuation.\n2.

Consider the context and the subject of the questions. The subject of the question is a dog. The context suggests that the dog is playing with it\u2019s owner as a joke.\nStep 3. Identify the answer choices. This question has five answer choices. Choices A and B can be eliminated because \u201chave\u201d is a wrong word choice for the sentence. Choices D and E can be eliminated because they make no sense compared to what is being asked. This leaves you with Choices C and Choice A.\nStep 4. Evaluate the answers. Choice A,\u201cplaying dead\u201d, is not a possible response to the scenario because no one is dead in this scenario. Choice A cannot be the correct answer.\nStep 5. Evaluate Choice B. Choice B, \u201calive\u201d is correct because the dog\u2019s owner does not die while playing around with the dog. Also, the sentence clearly states that the outcome of this situation will be that the dog is alive and healthy.\n\nSo the correct answer is Choice B, \u201cAlive\u201d.\nSo the final answer Alive.\n\nInput: What is the purpose of an ironing board?

Making someone a \"friend for life\" doesn't really align with the idea of a 'warning' or 'threat'.\nOption 3: This choice doesn's make sense, because making someone 'a friend for life' is too positive to signify a 'threat'. It's probably more appropriate to interpret \"I will bite, you\" as a friendly gesture, in this context.\nOption 4: This choice makes sense. 'Love' is a positive term, while the idea of warning or threat is associated with a more negative message.\nOption 5: This choice doesn' make sense, because while the idea of saying'making you something for life' makes sense, it would probably be more likely for someone to say this if they are trying", "answer": "E: neatness"}

{"idx": 159, "text": "1) First identify the context of the sentence and what it's asking about. We can tell that this sentence is describing John and Jane, two people who were dating and wanting to continue to do so. The sentence does NOT ask about the number of John and Jane, but rather what John and Jane were planning to do.\n2) Eliminate choice A: make sex.  This would only make sense if it asked about the number of John, Jane, and sex, but it doesn't, so it would be unreasonable to include it as an answer choice. \n3) This leaves us with choices B, C, D, and E, each covering a different activity that John and Jane could have been doing while dating.\n4) Eliminate choice B: plan to marry.  Planning to marry may take time but it's not a task that John and Jane would be doing on a daily basis while they were dating. \n5) Eliminate choice C: dance.  We still don't know whether this is asking about John and Jane as in \"the couple\" or whether the question is about John and Jane as individuals.  The term \"couple\" could be used to refer to groups of two or more people.  Consider the phrase \"the couple danced\" which doesn't necessarily infer that there exist any people named \"Coupled\".  Furthermore, if this IS about the term \"dance\" then the context of the sentence is unimportant, as \"dance\" can be done by any individual or any combination of individuals.  And if this IS about the particular couple (ie. John and Jane) then they may have been dancing a couple dance together, but then the number of people would also be relevant.  The fact that the sentence does not mention the number of John and/or Jane, and is focusing on the task of what they were doing together, further disqualifies this as a reasonable choice.\n6) And finally, we have choice E: row about.  This seems like a reasonable choice until we focus on the context of the sentence.  Given that John and Jane are a couple, and the couple was dating, it wouldn't make much sense for them to keep arguing or \"rowing about\".  If we're focusing on the sentence's contextual meaning then we know that there must be a reason why John and Jane were both", "answer": "B: plan to marry"}

The answer choices are: A: front of the door, B: bedroom, C: desk, D: table, and E: living room, and each option is clearly outlined with regard to where the piece of furniture originally came from or the intended purpose, with respects to the old rug.  \nStep 02: Eliminate options that aren't furniture.

An intersection is an area where two or more streets or roads meet, so we need to eliminate any answers that are not public areas like streets or roads.\nStep 2: Eliminate answer option A (cars) because cars are not an area for people to stand at an intersection. \nStep 3: Similarly, eliminated answer option B (city street) because a city street isn't typically the place people stand at an intersection, as there are often multiple intersections running through them.\nStep 4: Now that two of the options are out, we can narrow our choices down to D: fork in road and E: red light, as these are two possibilities for where roads might meet.\nStep 5 but 5: After considering the meaning of these two options (a fork in the road is where roads meet, and a red light is when traffic is stopped at an intersection to allow others to go through), we know that answer option E: red light is the correct answer, as people are indeed more likely to stand at a red light.

So in this case we know it's more than one person.\nStep 6 - We now need to decide if one or more people will react negatively to being told. We can already exclude one of the two answers that implies one person by seeing that it's plural, which means there is more than one person.

So, not necessary.\nC = seashore, no, it's not an amenity that is provided in a motel room.\nD = locker room, same as C.\nE = gy mnasiu m, it's Greek for \"Annex.\" But what does annex means? This word can also be used as a verb in English and has the approximate meaning of \"attach to something.\" So, maybe it's some kind of room add-on, but we can't know for sure. It can be either part of the room, accessible with a key or outside the room and accessible with a key, but since this is a multiple-choice question, we have to just put the most common type - a \"room add-on\" that is not really part of the room itself but provided to some degree to the tenant, and maybe also annexed with it somehow.\n\n4) That leaves us with choice A. From this choice, there are two possible meanings:\n\na) \"A\" = \"Bath\".\n\nb) \"A\" = the \"room add-on\", the annex\n\n5) If (a) is correct, then \"A\" and \"B\" can be combined into one word, and we can choose the shorter of the two: \"Bath\".

Therefore, \"dedication\" can be eliminated from this list.\n\nOption D: \"Dedication\" means that someone is \"dedicated\" to doing something. Therefore, \"dedicate\" is also a possible \"thing that it takes.\" So, we can eliminate option D and leave the list at \"focus\" and \"dedication.\"\n\nOption E: \"Solutions\" is not a thing, and that gives us an easy way to eliminate it.\n\nOption F: \"Dedication to something\" might have been the original complete phrase that the author wrote.

Another option that is possible is an atlas, but again, it is a country-sized reference and won't be appropriate for finding your location and way in a smaller area.\n\nStep 3: It's time to start eliminating answer choices that clearly don\u2019t fit. While it\u2019s true that an atlas can be used to find a way in a country, it\u2019s not made of paper, so it is not one of the options.\n\nStep 4: Start evaluating and eliminating answer choices using the criteria that remain. What can\u2019t be used to find your location along a highway? Well, it can\u2019t be made of paper or be an entirely outdoors area like a park or countryside.\n\nStep 5: Consider a few more answer choices. The USA, while it can\u2019t be used for such a narrow area, can be developed. This rule means it involves improvements to the environment that man has made, and therefor doesn\u2019t make sense for finding an individual location along a highway.\n\n2. Another answer choice that has both an outdoors and non-paper component is the atlas. While both features may be true, it\u2019s not the only option that meets the criteria.\n\n3. We are left with choosing between two options that both can be made of paper and used to find a location within a country. This leaves us to evaluate each answer option.

It would be out of place, he is singing in front of the entire class and there is no direct reason for the class to be particularly happy.\n\nC, \"glee\", fits the context, it is in a sentence with Danny singing and it is a noun, so it has to be describing the type of singing he was doing, he was singing with what can otherwise be considered glee.\n\nD, \"opera\", is also a noun that has the context of singing, however it is more likely a type of singing which is unrelated to this context and therefore doesn't make sense.\n\nE, \"injuries\", isn't even a word in the sentence and also doesn't fit the structure of the sentence, it is unlikely that someone would be injured after performing well in front of the entire school.

Abdominal muscles aren't typically something that humans take in, and \"open throat\" is too abstract to be an appropriate answer choice\nStep 5: Answer choice A (lungs, diaphragm) is still left as an option, so we'll need to make sure that it's an appropriate answer.

The word used is not \"sick\", so instead of \"ill\" we should interpret it as feeling bad, in pain, or some other kind or uncomfortable feeling.\n2. The question asks \"what could make a person feel ill?\" In this case, the person is affected by the word. If it's something that can make a person feel ill, it has a chance of affecting a person.\n3. One thing that affects people differently is the amount of weight they have lost. Because of this, they should weigh different amounts.\n4. Another thing that can make people feel differently is their blood thickness. Thick blood makes it harder for the body to circulate it.\n5. In the fifth option \"having much blood\" the word \"blood\" is acting as an object and cannot be the subject.\n6.

However, since the key words are already \"george\" and \"ruined\" we know that the first part is George ruined.  That leaves us with \"how\" to be the key word in the second part.  The sentence does not have an explicit subject and does not follow the subject + verb pattern.  Step 3: Identify the keywords that follow the question keyword.  So, George ruined something which left us with the two variables he and \"ruin\"  When we use \"how\" to ask for information about something, we need to provide more context to answer the question and narrow the variables.  We know that this could be any number of ways, so  we need to further narrow \"how\" is \"how did\" followed by \"he\" to provide more context and specify the answer.  The sentence has another keyword, and an appropriate answer will need to include \"how\" and \"he\".  Step 4: Analyze the list of answer choices to identify the common characteristic.  We're looking for a choice that contains \"how\" and \"him\".  We can eliminate choices A, B, and C because they do not include \"he\".  Answer choices D and E both include \"I know how\" and \"he\" respectively and are appropriate answers, so the correct answer is answer choice D: I know how he did so. \n\nSo, the final answer is D: I know how", "answer": "D: knowingly"}

If the pronoun phrase (and what?) does not have the same antecedents as the subject (she), then it does not have the same logical function as the subject (she). \n\n6. The pronoun phrase (and? what? is a pronoun phrase that contains a modal verb, so it's very likely to be a fragment that does not have the same subject as the subject (she) and thus should be ignored in this context.\n\n7.

By reviewing these key words, we can eliminate answer choices that are not relevant to the noun in question such as \"backpack,\" \"closet,\" \"drawer,\" and \"dinner.\"\n5.

In this case, we have \"The friends loved competing.\" Let's break this down as such: \"The friends\" -> subject, \"loved\" is present tense of love, \"competing\" is the verb, and \"against one another\" is the direct object.\nStep 3. Eliminate answer choices that do not fit the pattern such as \"against one,\" \"loved against one another,\" \"competing against,\" \"winning or losing,\" and \"friends love to compete.\"\nStep 4.

If the question were \"Why did the friends love to compete?\" the answer \"competition\" does not fit.\nStep 5. \"It was a good way to\" is present tense, so we should pick an answer that is also present tense. \nStep 6. Since it's a statement implied by the paragraph there should not be any additional phrases or clauses that are superfluous. Choosing \"good way to defeat\" is not correct since \"defeat\" is a noun and not part of the statement in present tense.\nStep 7. \"Work their what?\" is the missing phrase. The missing phrase cannot be a verb or a noun. If it were a verb, \"competing\" would be wrong. If it was a noun, \"competing against\" would be wrong. The grammatical pattern is a present tense verb + it. \"Winning or losing\" is not a present tense verb meaning \"winning or losing\" is wrong. \"Sweat\" is a nonsense answer since it is neither present tense nor a verb.\nStep 8. We have eliminated everything except \"competition\" and \"work their aggression,\" so we can conclude the answer. \nStep 9.

Therefore, we can be sure that the question does not refer to what makes someone sleep at night. This means we can probably eliminate answer choices that are related to making someone sleep, like having dreams or snoring. We can also probably eliminate answers that are irrelevant to getting sleep, like feeling restless or relaxed. This leaves us with 5 answers to consider.\nStep 1: Eliminate answer choices A and B because they refer to things that could help someone relax and get more sleep, not something that prevents them from getting sleep.\nStep 2:Elleiminate answer choice C because it refers to nightmares and nightmares are not what prevent someone from getting sleep atnight, they just make the sleep experience more unpleasant.\nStep 3. Eliminate answers D and E because they do not refer to anything that directly prevents someone from getting sleep and therefore it is unclear what they are doing in the answer. \nStep 4. Now we have three answers left that could be the correct choice. All of these answers refer to things that can prevent someone from getting sleep, such as tiredness, insomnia, or wakefulness. However, because an answer is not a correct answer simply because it mentions what keeps someone up at night (for instance, because it might mention several other things that are irrelevant to the question), we will now be looking at the words and phrases that follow the answer.\nStep 5. Eliminate answer C because it mentions exhaustion and restlessness, which are both things that can cause someone to have trouble sleeping but they are not the answer to the question.\nStep 6. Eliminate answer B because \"restlessness and insomnia\" are two things that could cause someone to stay awake at night, but the answer is actually \"insomnia and sleep deprivation\" which indicates only one cause of wakefulness.\nStep 7. Answer D stands out as the correct answer because it is the only answer that mentions two things that keep someone awake at night. In this case, that answer is \"disrupted sleep cycles due to stress and insomnia\". \nStep 8.

{"idx": 37, "text": "Step 0: First off, if you're getting this question multiple-choice form, take a moment to scan the information and try to understand what it is they're asking for. In this case, \"What is a great place...\" the obvious answer would be 'the great place' itself. The question, however, is asking about a noun, not a gerund. In other words, there exists a phrase \"great place\" that can stand alone, that the question refers to itself, rather than to an adjective, adverb, verb, or participle.\n\nStep 1: Recognize answer choice A for nonsensical. The basement isn't a place to lay in the summer sun. This reduces the choices to B, C, and E.\n\nStep:2 In addition, as in any multiple-choice reading comprehension quiz, make sure you eliminate any nonsensical or outlandish words as possibilities. For example, beans can't help keep you from \"melting\" in the summer heat, unless you have a beanstalk nearby for you to climb.\nStep 3. The choices are now reduced to B and E.\n\nIn the English language, the word great can refer to a location, as in the Great Wall of China. We also use the word great in a figurative sense, to describe things that are excellent or admired.\nIn this latter sense, great can be an adverb, a great place, a great deal, even a great idea.\nIn the case of this question, the correct answer must be E because, although B is the name of a body of water, a \"beach\" in this case refers to a type of place, rather than a general adjective.\nStep 4: In the same way, \"sand\" as a noun refers to things (like a beach), rather than as a gerund (like sanding).\nStep 5: In the same way that \"sand\" is a noun, \"sun\" is an adjective, even if it's often used as a noun and takes a verb, to shine or to rise. However, for a sun to \"lay in the sun\" would be a strange thing indeed.\nStep 4 Finally, we are left with E: beans. You can now read and understand the question as a question about an excellent place to lay in", "answer": "D: beach"}

{"idx": 161, "text": "The question being asked is \"who is likely going into a market?\" and the choices are A: stress, B: food, C: that you, D: spending money, E: walking.\n\nTo begin, we must interpret the meaning of the sentence. The sentence gives the scenario where a person is in a market and the person is likely carrying out various actions. The question we are being asked is which of these actions are being performed by the person. We can conclude that stress is exempted because it is unlikely, similar to a person walking into a shop when they are stressed.\n\nOur next step is to exclude any choices that can be inferred through process of elimination. For example, we can rule D out because while a person may have food, it is not likely the focus of their activity.\n\nEliminating choices C and E are easier \u2013 if a person is spending money then they are not spending money on the food and C is ruled out. Similarly, even if a person does have spending money on them (E), they are unlikely to be focused on using that money in a market.\n\nFinally, we have the question reduced to B and A. To compare the options, we must consider their plausibility in the scenario the question presents. In this scenario, we can assume that a person is likely doing most of their activity at the food stalls in the market rather than the vegetable stalls. Hence B is ruled out.\n\nComparing the remaining option, we can consider the likelihood that a person is focused on carrying their food home.

The first step in answering this question correctly is to understand the context - we're talking about paying with a mobile phone, and there are several options listed in the choices.\n2. We can rule out answer choices that don't make sense in the context, such as \"pay the money with the money bag\" or \"pay the money with a blank card.\"\n3. We can then examine the remaining answer choices and determine which makes the most sense - the choices listed as \"pay the money\" and \"pay the card.\"\n\nOutput: A: Choice A is unlikely because this would involve removing cash from the bank using a mobile phone. This is not a common thing to do with a phone and wouldn't be considered \"paying with\" a phone.", "answer": "A: mail orders"}

This means that the answer must be either \"carpet\" or \"all buildings.\"\nStep 6: By process of elimineation, the answer is D: all buildings since carpet requires maintenance, so it should not be kept clean in a holy place in all buildings.

{"idx": 329, "text": "There are three distinct steps in the method that you can follow to solve this type of puzzle.\nStep 1: Break the question down to its basic parts. In this question, this step has two parts, \"Where MIGHT I find unusual varieties...\" and \"roses\".\nStep 2: Evaluate each potential answer against the clue. In this case, Step 2 is asking \"Might I find unusual varieties?\"\nStep 3: Analyze the question for additional clues that may be present in the context. While Step 2 can eliminate some common response options, some questions may provide additional clues, in which case additional information will need to be considered. In Step 3, the only clue is \"where\", which can point to any location.\nTherefore, the steps should be used in order. So start by breaking down the question, which provides the phrases \"MIGHT I find in unusual varieties?\" and \"roses\". \nIn this case, Step 1 has already been completed.\nNext, evaluate each potential answer. The options are A: botanic gardens, B: flower gardens, C: backyard gardens, D: supermarkets, and E: outdoors. \nThe first choice is definitely a place to find roses, but it is not used for unusual varieties, so this is not the correct choice.\nStep 1 helped us to see that these words are used in the same sentence, which means the meaning of the sentence applies to everything that follows it. This makes flower gardens also not the ideal answer. This leaves us with the other three choices: backyard gardens and outdoors.\nThe last two choices can both be locations, so the clue \"Where\" is ambiguous, but since there are no clues for any other locations that can be used to narrow it down, we can say in this instance that \"outdoors\" can be selected, as that is the only remaining option. \nNow that we have eliminated one of the choices as not being a viable solution, we can repeat the same process using the remaining two options.\nBy applying a similar process, once again we have narrowed down the options. The best option is C: backyard gardents, the least ideal option is E: outdoors, and the only remaining option is A: botanical gardens.  \nSo, the answer is C: back", "answer": "A: botanic garden"}
{"idx": 333, "text": "What we can do to get to the correct answer is to break down the question into smaller pieces and ask ourselves several specific questions.\nStarting with the word \"one,\" we can cross out choice A, as it doesn't make sense to stand or see a fox at a zoo.\nNext, we consider the \"in a landlocked, southern[...]\" portion. The word \"landlocked\" means surrounded by land on all sides. If you are in a landlocked state, you cannot be at the sea, meaning you are on land. \nConsequently, we can cross out choice B, as South Carolina is a sea-locked state and, if you are in South Carolina, you are not necessarily on land.\nSimilarly, if you are in a land locked state, it is unlikely you are in an un-specified southern state (i.e., \"any other southern state\"). Therefore, choices C and D can be eliminated.\nAt this point we are left with choice E, Arkansas, since if \"one sees a fox\" and is in a landlocked southern state, it must be Arkansas.\nSo the correct answer is E: Arkansas.\nSo now the final answer is E, Arkansas.\n\nInput: I often have an unanswered question.

This is because, as stated in the original question, I do not know what I want do and I do not want to know what I want to do.\nThe remaining answer choices have no obvious grammatical errors and thus are plausible options for the given context.\nAs a result, choice B (i.e., what if I don't know) is the best answer.\nSo the final two answer are what if I don\u2019;t know and I do what.\n\nInput:", "answer": "E: arkansas"}

{"idx": 401, "text": "Step 4: Identify what it is the question is asking, and understand what sort of language is being used.\nStep 5. In this case, we can understand that the question is asking us to identify which word, from the above set of words, has been used to describe some event which has been reported.\nStep 7. Consider the list of keywords. There are two words which can be used as adjectives to describe events. \u2018happen\u2019, and \u2018accident\u2019. Both of these words, when used as an adjective, are describing the same thing. We can further simplify this by assuming that \u2018happening often\u2019 does not make much sense in the context where it is used.\nStep 8. The choice D: \u2018happen often\u2019 is out of the list since it is already said they \u2018happen anytime\u2019.\nStep 9. Choice \u2018B: \u2018hurt people\u2019 is also impossible. We can see in the question that the lady is \u2018getting worked up\u2019, which means that she is not hurt by the article describing the uptick in the accidents.\nStep 10. This leaves us with two options A: \u2018happen to people\u2019 and E: \u2018happen anywhere\u2019\nStep 11. The first option A in the list is the correct one. We can see that E: \u2018happen to anywhere\u2019 is not a correct answer because it does not make any sense to say that \u2018accidents happen anywhere\u2019.\nStep 12. \u2018accidents happen to\u2019 can be rephrased as \u2018accidents\u2019 are a result of events. We can see in our context that \u2018accidents\u2019 are only the result of some events. Therefore, they \u2018happen to\u2019 the people who caused the accident.\nStep 13. \u2018accidents happen\u2019 can be interpreted as all \u2018accidents happen\u2019, or \u2018there is just no stopping accidents\u2019 or an explanation about the fact that \u2018accidents aren\u2019t just happening once. They are happening quite often\u2019. \u2018accident happens to\u2019 on the other hand explains \u2018accident happens only to some people\u2019. As such, it is the most relevant choice in the question.\nStep 14. Therefore, the correct answer is A: \u2018accidents happen only to people\u2019.\nSo the final correct answer is A: accidents happen only to people.", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}

For \"city,\" consider if the term \"city\" could be part of an appositive phrase (a noun describing another noun) that would modify or explain \"James.\" \"James lived in the top part of a tall tower of a medieval castle\" is an example of such an appositive.  City would then be modifying place, which would render it unnecessary.\n\n5. For \"radio station,\" consider if the term\"radio station\" could be part of a compound noun (a noun that includes modifiers) that would modify or describe \"James.\" \"James listened to a radio station every evening at his tower\" is an example of this type of compound noun.  Radio station would then be modifying the place as opposed to \"James.\"\n6. Consider the word \"himself\"; does it add any information that would help the identification process?  Does it sound more like it's referring to the person or place? \n7.

Identify the context and determine whether the question has a positive or negative connotation to its emotion.\n3. Consider whether the emotion is internal or external/external.\n4. We can then eliminate answer choices with inappropriate contexts or emotion types.\n5. For instance, A: misery is an appropriate response if the woman is experiencing a bad time, but not great joy.\n6. Similarly, B: sadness is an appropriate response if she experiences an unfortunate event, but not great joy either.\n7. C: bad time is not appropriate here either, since it doesn't match the context or connotation of the question.\n8. D: sorrow is not an appropriate response either since it fits neither the context nor the connotation of the question\n9.

Understand the context of the situation: when you see the bird.\nStep 8. Consider whether the situation will elicit a positive or negative emotional response.\nStep 9. Eliminate negative options since we want the positive response \"happy\" for the bird.\nStep10: Finally, identify the emotion we are looking for: satisfied.\nInput: When I saw the bird,I got what? Choices: happiness A: satisfaction B: sadness C : satisfaction D: sadness E: happiness\nOutput:Step 1: Identify and understand the question\n2. This question is asking about what was the outcome when one saw the bird.\n3. Stepper: Eliminate options that do not refer to an event when the bird was seen.\n4. Stepper: Eliminte any negative response options, since that is not what the asker intended to ask about.\n5.

If a specific location is given in the sentence, this will be an incorrect answer. For example answer E (the wrong mail box) is an incorrect response as the wording implies a person is searching for a box, which a bank does not have.\nStep 3 (optional but recommended): We can also eliminate incorrect places. Incorrect sentences will typically be either an incorrect location or an incorrect geographic object. For example, answer choice D (in the wrong postal code) is incorrect because postal codes do not exist in the United States.\nStep 4: By process of elimining, we have eliminated all incorrect answers.\nStep 5 (optional): We will combine two phrases of the same meaning into one phrase.\nThe phrase \"address\" is similar in meaning to the phrase \"location\".

Identifying common synonymous words and phrases can help narrow down the choices. If the question uses the same word or phrase multiple times, there is probably a synonym that is being used. Examples might include \"I have a cat\" and \"I'm a cat lover.\"\n2. Understanding the context of the question is also crucial. Synonyms can be used to convey the same basic concept, but if the question is specific about what it is trying to convey, it will help narrow down choice B and E as possible choices.\n3. If there are several synonyms that fit the context and meaning of a question, consider using a thesaurus to help guide your choice.\n\nStep 4: Identify answers which are not in the question, including all synonyms.\nPossibility, The word \"might\" is not in the question, so it is not part of the answer choices.\nConclusion: The answer choices are \"nothing,\" \"sleep,\" and \"get cold.\"\nStep 5: Exclude answers with no reasonable explanations.\nAnswer choice \"nothing\" and \"sleep\" are grammatically incorrect, and \"get cold\" is repetitive.\nStep 6, exclude answers with no rational explanations.\nAnswer choices \"getting cold\" and \"nothing\" are not rational.\nExclude answer choices \"nothing\" and \"getting cold.\"\nThe answer choice is \"sleep.\"\nFinal Answer: The answer is \"Sleep.\"\n\nInput:What is the value of the question mark?

The question asks for a location, not a thing so it's likely not the answer.\nStep 11: Consider answer choice B (animal shelter) in light of this reasoning and reasoning from the previous question. The question asks for the location, so answer choices that are not locations, like shelter, aren't likely to be correct.\nStep 12: Consider the fact that this question was about \"small dog,\" and therefore consider that a shelter will most likely be unwilling to take in a stray, as well as being too large of an answer.\nStep 3 (cont): Step 3 (concluded): Consider answer choice E (dog show) in light of this thinking.

If we substitute \"known\" with \"having or being\" or \"well-known\", the second part of the question would become: \"If you're/one that is well-known, what would you be called?\".\n3) We can now look at the answer options and figure out what they mean.\n4) According to the question, we need to have an understanding of both the adjectives used to describe the answer options:\n- \"gift buyer\" means someone who buys gifts.\n- \"earn money\" means someone who makes money.\n- \"have money\" means someone who has money.\n5) In fact, the answer options do not have any direct connection with being well-known, as they only describe the characteristic people have.\n6) So the correct answer choice is: D: have money, because we do not exactly know what \"well-known\" means and its relationship to the answer options.\n\nSo the final answer here is D: have money.\n\nInput: I know of someone who is an outstanding teacher Choices:  A. gift giver B. gift buyer C. babysitter D. great E. earn money\nOutput: I know of someone with \"babysitter\" as occupation.\n\nInput:Who is your boss Choices:  A A B CEEE\nOutput: A is your boss\n\nInput: Who is your boss Choice: A-CEEE\nOutput: A\n\n\n### Step 2: Question:  What is the most likely job title?\n### Answer the following multiple choice question\n\nInput: Who wrote Hamlet?

It\u2019s reasonable to assume that there would be places in your life where you may need to carry a bag of some sort. \nStep 3B: We can go a step further than step 3 and remove any answer choices that are associated with the question. A \u201cWhat sort of place\u201d question will be very specific. A laundry room suggests a \u201ccleaning-related\u201d place where there is a lot of laundry activity. An airport, on the other hand, is not really associated with laundry because you are going somewhere else \u2013 the answer choice should support the general activity of carrying a bag and be associated with the question as much as possible.\nTherefore, the answer is E, laundry room.\nSo the final question is A person would carry a big drawstring bag to a laundry room.", "answer": "E: laundry room"}

The focus of the sentence is on how the person feels about their job search, so we can eliminate any options that don't address this directly or indirectly such as choice B (employment) and choice D (working hard).\n3. We can then evaluate each of the remaining choices in light of the context of the sentence:\n4. Choice A (frustration) is a possible option because frustration might be an indirect response to being unable to find a job after applying.\n5. Choice C (stress) doesn't seem to fit as directly as option A, although stress can be a result of feeling frustrated or disappointed in not being able to find a job.\n6. Choice B (employment) would be an appropriate answer if it were the word \"employment\" with which the person feels frustrated, but the sentence describes qualifying for jobs, not being hired with no calls back.\n7. Similarly, answer choice D (working hard) might be appropriate if it were the phrase \"working hard\" with which the person felt, but the sentence doesn't indicate a person specifically feeling that way.\n8. Choice E (love) is not appropriate because it is not directly related to the topic of the sentence.\n9.

{"idx": 881, "text": "This type of riddle is also known as a \"whodunit riddle\" because the intention is to test the deduction capability of the solver. This one is a classic - you start with asking about torn off shingles. This is because shingles are more prone to getting torn off in high winds.\nStep 1: Identify what the question is asking. In this case, it's asking for how the wind is like. This leads us to ask how the wind moves.\nStep 2: Determine which answers are unlikely. We can eliminate obvious incorrect (and often intentionally deceptive) answers like A (hair), B (spreading), and C (blowing hard). These are all physical properties of hair and wind and do not capture the idea that was intended.\nStep 3 (and this is important): Next, we can reasonably evaluate which answers are plausible. For example, we will reasonably eliminate answers D and B because the wind blows the wind down, not in the opposite direction. Further, this answer choice doesn't make sense because blowing hard is something that can also occur with blowing.\nStep 4: When evaluating the answers remaining we are looking for patterns in the answer choices to guide us to the correct answer. In this case, we can reasonably eliminate E (wave wheat) because while waves are a common property of water and wind, that answer is not associated with shingles and this answer is unlikely the intended answer.\nStep 5 (this is another critical step): We can now reasonably evaluate the final two remaining answers. A (dry hair) is plausible because water is indeed common for hair and shingles. However, we can find this answer plausible because while water is common for hair and shelves, this answer is also associated with fire and this answer doesn't make sense for an area that experiences high winds.\nTherefore, the answer is A (dry hair).

{"idx": 885, "text": "The key to answering this multiple-choice question requires a thorough understanding of the question's meaning and context. By evaluating what is being asked and considering the information given, you can determine which answer is the best one.\nWhen you do so, you'll find that it can be answered using one of the multiple-choice answers. \n\nTo begin, let's examine the question closely and identify what it is asking for. It asks us to identify \"what greatest of the Michigan'is greats?\" The answer will be one of the many bodies of water that make up Michigan,\n\nFirst, we should consider what information is given. We learn that ice fishing in Michigan's bodies of water is possible despite being so far out into the frozen lakes that it surprises most people. In this case, we know two important pieces of information: \n\n1) Michigan is filled with many large bodies of water.\n2) Michigan's bodies of ice have reached extreme temperatures, allowing people to ice fish far out.\nThese points can help you narrow down your answer choices.\n\nNext, when making this multiple-choice question, we consider our answer choices starting from the end and working backward, \nso let's eliminate choices with less information or with different body of water. In this case, there are three choices with information that directly related to Michigan's many bodies of water and another choice that is directly related to Michigan'is greats.\n\nLet's now consider choice A: \"pond.\" Ponds are smaller bodies of water that may or may not exist near larger bodies of water in a specific area. However, they don't have the same name recognition as lakes or water bodies like Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. Eliminate it from consideration\n\nNext, let's consider choice B: \"lake superior.\" In this choice, we have a more well-known body of water like the Great Lakes that we can ice fish far out on. However, it's not a name people normally use to identify these bodies of water, so we can exclude it.\n\nFinally, we consider choice D: the \"Great Lakes\". We can eliminate this choice because although they are popularly known as the Great Lakes, they are a specific group of bodies of water, not a name for Michigan's biggest body of water.\n\nWe've just eliminated three choices by", "answer": "D: lake superior"}
{"idx": 889, "text": "1: Start by identifying the question, which is: \"If there is a stinky smell in the air, what should one check the source of?\" \n2. Once you've identified the question, read the question again and try to understand what it's all about. \n3. Examine the context of the question and use common sense to eliminate all of the answer choices that don't make sense. For example, in this case the question indicates a kitchen, implying that it's indoors. Therefore, we can eliminate choices outside of the kitchen. \n4. As we narrow down the answer choices, it's a good idea to categorize them, such as by place or by object. For example, let's assume one of your answer choices was a \"bathroom\". \n5. This could mean there was a source of a stale smell anywhere from someone's apartment, to a public building, to a bus, etc. Therefore, we need to eliminate all answer choices that would be far from the kitchen where the smell originates. \n6. When you do this, you can see that choices B, C, D, and E could potentially be sources of the smell. \n7. However, answer choice B describes the \"house\" as a whole, so it can't possibly be the smell. Choice C, the cupboard, is a small space that couldn't possibly smell very much. So, it's unlikely. Choices D and E, the space shuttle and the surface of the Earth, are out of the question because they're out of the \"indoors\" area. \n8. So now you've reduced the answer choices to just two: A and C. Finally, after some deliberation, you decide there's no way it could be the bathroom. Answer choice A, the kitchen, is the obvious choice.  \nTherefore, the final answer is A: kitchen.\n\nSo the final answer to this question from above is: A: kitchen", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Choices: 1. A: a swimmer 2. B: a basketball player 3. C: football player 4. D: an athlete 5.

If someone \"could be qualified\" they must be qualified in some way. To determine if someone is qualified they must know what type of sport they're qualified in. For example, a swimmer is qualified in swimming, a basketball player is qualified in basketball, a football player in football. So the key word that the answer includes must refer to the sport the person is qualified in, rather than just the skill. So the options can eliminate A: a swimmer, B: a basketball player, D: an athlete\n\n3/4: We can now eliminate C: football player as it does not refer to a person qualified in a particular sport.\nOnly E: the swimmer is a person qualified in a sport and this meets the criteria for a qualified person.\nSo the final option is E: the swimmer.\n\nSo the final answer can be swimmer\n\nInput: Which instrument is most likely to have been invented by a scientist?

Option A is incorrect as it means things are not likely to happen in real life, so therefore they are not real. Option B is incorrect as it denotes the creation of something in the mind and the word \"reality\", as the \"reality test\" says, is a test of whether something is real or not. Option C is incorrect as the word \"dreamworker\" means a psychology practitioner who specializes in dreams. Option D is incorrect as the word nightmare means a terrifying dream. Thus, the only option which fits correctly into the paragraph is the correct answer: \"A.

{"idx": 310, "text": "I had this question. At first look, it seems like it could be any number of options.\nThis is because when it comes to word problems, the first step is to identify the context and what the question is asking. For example, you can see that it's asking about two people competing against each other.\n\nSo that tells you that it refers to a competition or rivalry of some kind. And with a little more thought and context, you can eliminate the option A: stress because we can't just \"get into\" stress.\n\nIt might be a negative outcome, but stress isn't an answer to the question. I also feel confident in eliminating option B: debate because that's something that you do, not something that you can \"get into.\"\n\nOption C: argument is similar, but it's also not a thing you get into, right? It's something that you have, so we can eliminate that one too.\n\nAnswer choice D: winning or losing is also tricky because at least in the case of most games, there isn't another way to get into a competition. If you lose, you lose.\n\nSo if we aren't sure about D, there's only one alternative left: option E: tension.\nAnd that's indeed the correct option, because it has the most reasonable meaning for the question in this context.

It's something that isn't a raw part of nature in some cases.\n\nThat being said, a tool is often the specific thing that you're holding, or using right now.

This means that the answer choices must not be statements that ensure the confirmation would succeed. \n\nWe can eliminate option A (question), as such a question is not likely to cause something to fail. \n\nWe need to eliminate as many answers as possible, so we eliminate B (dispute), because the reference being disputed may not hold, which would not cause the confirmation to fail. \nD (contradict) should be eliminated because even if the referent's reference does contradict the applicant, this will not cause the confirmation attempt to fail, as a contradiction is not in itself sufficient to cause something to \"fail\". \nWe can eliminate E (refuse) as this answer choice is not sufficient to cause the confirmation attempt failure.\n\nThis leaves us with C (deny) as the correct answer, as something that \"denies\" the applicant's reference will cause the confirmation attempt fail. \n\nTherefore, deny is the answer.

There are three possible choices related to \"ethics\" here, but \"ethical\" is a single word, so it makes more sense to group these answers and eliminate the others, beginning with C (ethical): the term \"ethics\" is a specific type of behavior, so any answer that doesn't contain the term \"ethical\" is incorrect.\n5.

Second, we should eliminate answers that aren't relevant to the question. For example, we should be careful of phrasing that may be intentionally tricky, but that actually doesn't make sense. For example, if someone were to ask \"Where do you go for a milkshake?\", it would be obvious that they were trying to trick us into saying \"supermarket.\" But here, the question feels more honest.\n3. Third, we should consider the meaning of the words. If the question says \"What animal produces milk?\", asking about a'milkshake' would be odd.\n4. Finally, we should try to think of a relevant answer choice not among the options already given.

An easy way to find a location is to use the preposition \"where.\"  In this question, the question uses the word \"where,\" so we can eliminate answers like \"band\" and \"music room\" because they are not places.

So, you can conclude that the answer choices should also be singular.  The answer choices should not be the weather or maybe and so on.  Therefore, the answer choices should only be A or B.  Answer choice C:maybe and D:Definitely are considered to not follow the order of the structure of the sentence because the plural form of the sentence \"will the weather is (being) good? \" is considered to be A or B.\n\nStep 3", "answer": "B: airport"}

In other words, the blank cannot be filled by an answer whose meaning is something like \"I was talking with some person\" or \"I was talking with people\".\n4.

Well, he will tell you by explaining clearly, so raise a hand is a way to request your question, so that is b, asking your lecture is the next day is to explain his concepts via the lecture itself, but we have two choices, so c.  <n>All in all, if you can't understand the question, just use your common sense and you will find the answer.  <n>Or use `answer -p <problem>`.

A dog that loves you is very different from a dog that hates you.  A dog wouldn't respond if it didn't like you at all!

Of course there could be a squirrel, but it's way less likely than a cat or lizard, both of which have the ability to wander far beyond the edge of a stroll.<n><n>Instruction:Choose a 100-by-100-or-greater grid as a map of your home.

Given that you have a string array of one or more numbers, you need to perform the following operation "f(m)" on each number in the string array and print the result at the end.<n><n>For example, suppose the string "a0.7e", the result will be a number printed that is the result of "f(0.7e)". Since "f" is a function where the operands are numbers and the operations are of the form: pow(2), pow(2,4), sq(2), etc.<n>```<n>Input: a0.7e<n>Output: 5.725e-18<n>```<n>The only limitation is that there can only be an even number of operators between (including) the first number (which can be 0 or 1) and the last number ("e").

The output for a two-number sequence should output the sequence of two numbers, one is the first number and the other comes from the "do" operation, and then should return "zero". For example, for the sequence "2", the output should be 1, then the function should reset the sequence counter to 0, and output 0.<n><n><n>## Instructions: Input a 3D matrix: <n>```<n>Input:        [<n>          0.90,     0.40,     0.20,<n>          0.14,     0.50,     0.90,<n>          0,       -0.49,     0.32<n>        ]<n>```<n>

Such a man's wife will  soon die.  A very bad sign indicates a ship that is carrying a very angry  crew.  It is likely to crash.  It is a bad sign when a ship  flies a flag that is made of silk.  That means good times are ahead.  A  sign of bad luck is to see an old man walking backwards.  A ship is at  peril when three sailors sing three different songs.  They will soon perish.  Sailors who see people running away from a house are at risk.  Bad  omens are to be feared.

{"text": "E: enjoyment\n\n---\n### Instructions:\nIn this problem, you will perform an operation on the function \"f\". Given that you have a string array of one or more numbers, you need to perform the following operation \"f(m)\" on each number in the string array and print the result at the end.\n\nFor example, suppose the string \"a0.7e\", the result will be a number printed that is the result of \"f(0.7e)\". Since \"f\" is a function where the operands are numbers and the operations are of the form: pow(2), pow(2,4), sq(2), etc.\n```\nInput: a0.7e\nOutput: 5.725e-18\n```\nThe only limitation is that there can only be an even number of operators between (including) the first number (which can be 0 or 1) and the last number (\"e\"). In the example above, the string can be broken into two strings like \"a0e7\" and \"7e\". Both strings can be used to calculate the result.\n\n---\n## Instructions:\nThis problem is a generalization of the first one. Given a sequence of numbers:\n```\nInput:  2\n\nOutput:  1\n```\n```\nInput: 4\n    2\n\nOutput: 3\n```\nInput a sequence of numbers: for each sequence (not number), take the previous sequence and \"do\" the \"operator\" function to it, then use the result to produce another sequence of numbers, and continue until a single number is not possible to produce.  The output for a two-number sequence should output the sequence of two numbers, one is the first number and the other comes from the \"do\" operation, and then should return \"zero\". For example, for the sequence \"2\", the output should be 1, then the function should reset the sequence counter to 0, and output 0.\n\n\n## Instructions: Input a 3D matrix: \n```\nInput:        [\n          0.90,     0.40,     0.20,\n          0.14,     0.50,     0.90,\n          0,       -0.49,     0.32\n        ]\n```", "answer": "D: happiness"}

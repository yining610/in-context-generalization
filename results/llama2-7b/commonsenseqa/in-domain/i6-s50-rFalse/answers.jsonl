It started off well, there was no traffic trouble; I took the 110 freeway instead of the 405.  When I got to my mother's house, everything was great except that she hadn't defrosted any of the meat. That was all I thought until I realized I had left my keys at home and had to go back to the house to pick them up.  By the time I got back to the car I was starving!  So, I drove as fast as I could and made one of those mistakes that cost me my whole day off.  I decided I wanted to go home right away, but a little after the 118, the traffic on the 210 began to build. I was stuck for a little while, but then things cleared up.  After a while, I found out that the traffic was worse than normal, but in order to find out what was causing me to sit in the freeway for an hour, I had to get off.  I used the GPS, and decided to use the 138 to avoid driving around on the same freeway I had already been on.  It took me to the 605 freeway, which was also jammed up with traffic.  On that freeway I got into an accident.   My brother is at the hospital with a broken arm. While he was at the hospital, he had to go under anesthesia to have a drip put in.  He ended up being put on some other medication.  His arm hurts, and our parents had to leave the hospital early to work.   My car was broken and the car wash wouldn't work", "answer": "D: atlas"}

What kind of breathing only indicates you are sick?  (A)  Sigh \n\n### Solution Explanation:\nThis question's context is a little suspicious.  One sentence of the question, \"What do you wear on the _bridge_ of your nose?\" (implied: \"What you wear on any part of your nose\"), is not entirely reasonable, since a _bridge_ is simply a ridge, and not any part of the nose.  My suspicions are reinforced that one is to _answer_ the question, not ask it: the only acceptable answer is a scar. The second clue is in the \"The player went to the penalty _box\"_. No player ever goes to the penalty box; he goes to the penalty _stall_.  The penalty box is the area where the players stand while waiting for a penalty.\n\nB. A good student _makes time_ for study. Studying is work that requires time. A lazy student doesn\u2019t \u201cmake time\u201d, he \u201cfinds time\u201d. A student who makes time for study", "answer": "B: need for rest"}

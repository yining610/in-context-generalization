It started off well, there was no traffic trouble; I took the 110 freeway instead of the 405.  When I got to my mother's house, everything was great except that she hadn't defrosted any of the meat. That was all I thought until I realized I had left my keys at home and had to go back to the house to pick them up.  By the time I got back to the car I was starving!  So, I drove as fast as I could and made one of those mistakes that cost me my whole day off.  I decided I wanted to go home right away, but a little after the 118, the traffic on the 210 began to build. I was stuck for a little while, but then things cleared up.  After a while, I found out that the traffic was worse than normal, but in order to find out what was causing me to sit in the freeway for an hour, I had to get off.  I used the GPS, and decided to use the 138 to avoid driving around on the same freeway I had already been on.  It took me to the 605 freeway, which was also jammed up with traffic.  On that freeway I got into an accident.   My brother is at the hospital with a broken arm. While he was at the hospital, he had to go under anesthesia to have a drip put in.  He ended up being put on some other medication.  His arm hurts, and our parents had to leave the hospital early to work.   My car was broken and the car wash wouldn't work

When you’re a sneaky editor, by stealing other people’s words you’re making yourself look good, but leaving the people who wrote everything to look bad. <n><n>The best reason not to steal other works, other than not looking like a schmuck, is that it undermines the integrity of the system that has created our copyright system.  <n><n>Most scholars, however, believe, with  a few notable exceptions, that we should have a system that incentivizes the production of the sorts of works that make us better people.  It’s an incredible leap of faith to believe that, by making money by taking others’ works, you will “give back.”  If your incentive is money, you’ll try to produce less and make more. <n>

What kind of breathing only indicates you are sick?  (A)  Sigh <n><n>### Solution Explanation:<n>This question's context is a little suspicious.  One sentence of the question, "What do you wear on the _bridge_ of your nose?" (implied: "What you wear on any part of your nose"), is not entirely reasonable, since a _bridge_ is simply a ridge, and not any part of the nose.  My suspicions are reinforced that one is to _answer_ the question, not ask it: the only acceptable answer is a scar. The second clue is in the "The player went to the penalty _box"_. No player ever goes to the penalty box; he goes to the penalty _stall_.  The penalty box is the area where the players stand while waiting for a penalty.<n><n>B. A good student _makes time_ for study. Studying is work that requires time. A lazy student doesn’t “make time”, he “finds time”. A student who makes time for study

You ask the person with you “is it a table or a piano?” You say table or piano, and the same person will always answer the same. You guessed it and you are correct. What will they say if you guess is it a piano or a table? Choices: A.  they say “yes” B. They say “no” C. the answer to the above is “a piano”<n>Output: D. They say piano.<n><n>Instructions:<n>You are playing a game in where you are blind folded and the person next to you say's yes when you say a “table” and says no if you say it's a piano. I am unsure of when B. was the answer because every question had two answers that were opposites, thus it could have been that they said they would answer “no” instead of “yes”.<n><n>Instructions for output: <n>The output is correct if they say “no” if and only if if they say that they always answer the same way which means when you said you would guess the piano, they will always say “no”. If they were to answer the piano, than they would always say “yes” since that is the only thing you can not tell apart by knowing for fact they always answer the same.<n><n>Output will be incorrect if they say no for the piano, and say yes for the table which means that instead of you asking “is it a piano or a piano?” if you ask “is it a piano and a table” they would always answer “no” but when they are asked if it is a piano and table, they will give a different answer

For each paragraph, fill in the blank with a choice from the choices<n>listed. The word "nonsensical" is defined as "doing something useless or without a purpose."  1. _The cough can be a nauseous sign. A nauseous sign is something the same as a sign, but a little worse since the person has nausea<n>because of it. Nausea is a nauseous symptom. If you are in bed and having cough, that is a nauseous sign_.<n>2. _Coughing is a way to get rid of saliva and other secretions from the mucous membrane in one's lungs. It can also  be a warning sign of asthma. Often, coughing is a symptom of a serious medical condition, but it can also be a nonsensical<n>phenomenon, something that happens but is not useful. For instance, when coughing occurs, you may be given an unhelpful answer<n>like "you are coughing"_.<n>

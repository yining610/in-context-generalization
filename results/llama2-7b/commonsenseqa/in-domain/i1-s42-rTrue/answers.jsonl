In the context sentence, we can see that \"Google maps\" is used to mean \"a service\" used for navigation, \n3. The answer \"map\" is a singular noun, which can be used for navigation, and can be used in the plural form, for several maps. \n4. In the context sentence \"we\" refers to \"we do not need to find our own way around\". This could also be referring to maps as in \"we need no maps\" which are both singular, so the answer would be \"map\" as singular.\nIn the context sentence, the words used can not be interchanged, \"replaced\" means eliminated, and \"map\" doesn't make sense in all of the words in the choices.  \n\n### Input:\"I've never been to Africa, but I would love to see it one day.\" what is the intended meaning of the sentence?

{"text": "A: shirt pocket\n\n### Why:There is no need to blot the excess ink, because only the pen's ink reservoir stores ink. It is unlikely that a fountain pen would have a calligrapher' s hand. Furthermore, we know that it is used to record thoughts or sentences, although this is not the only use for a fountain pen, and it is not mentioned as such in the prompt.\n\nInkwells have been used to store ink since early writers, and were commonly found alongside writing instruments. At that time, there were no blotters as there are today. However, a blotter is no longer required with modern stationery, as many notebooks have a pocket where one can store a blotter. Thus, the blotter is not a logical choice either.\n\n### As an alternative, we might wonder why it is necessary to blot the ink if one is not a calligrapher and has not run out of ink. However, this is not mentioned in the question itself.\n\n### The only thing that stands out in the question is the absorb of extra ink. However, there is no need to absorb extra in the ink because ink contains the chemical properties needed by people to produce writing. It is only used for writing, not other activities. Therefore, the absorb of extra means that it is to be used after the writing is finished.\n\n### This explanation can be supported by the following:\n### 1. People absorb extra ink after they finished writing. When writing is over, the excess ink will not be absorbed, so extra ink is absorbed to ensure that excess ink is not left in the fountain pen pen. That is, the extra ink should be absorbed when it needs to be used after writing, such as writing a second letter, rather than when it has nothing to do with it. \n### 2. Ink requires certain conditions to absorb ink, so it is not absorb directly.\n### 3. The writing is over, and the excess ink will be absorbed afterward. It is also possible to absorb the ink into something else when writing it. \n## Answer:\nA: shirt pocket", "answer": "E: blotter"}

Therefore, the best answer is (D) to build a fire.\n\n### Input :The best way to keep track of what you are eating when you are on a diet? Choices:  B: keep a log C: stop eating when you're full D: eat less E: write an essay on what you are consuming\n\n### Response :\n\nFor me, the best way to keep track is to stop eating when you are full. In general, when a person\u2019s full, they stop eating. Thus, the best method is stop eating if you are full.\n\n### Explination :\n\nAs we can see (it is stated in the text as it says \u201dStop eating when you ARE FULL\u201d) I would choose option C to stop eating when full. As it states, stopping eating when you full will help you loose weight for sure.\n\n### Below are examples of things some people have a fear of.\n\nThe question asks us to select which is an actual fear among all provided choices.\n\nThe correct answer is (E). A person's hair being on fire is obviously an irrational fear since it is not likely to occur in everyday life. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) to fall out of airplane or balloon. The text says \"fall out of airplane or helicopter\" thus the best answer to the question is (E).", "answer": "D: light fire"}

This specific instance has the word \"kind\" in the question, pointing towards a broad, general category instead of a specific item.\n2) The phrase \"on what kind of ink\", along with the context of the original question, indicates that the ink is required to be used for writing. Therefore, the correct answer would not be B, which refers to binders or metal.\n3) Similarly, the phrase \"A: wood\" is inappropriate, since wood is used for building purposes.\n4) This leaves us with A and E as the only plausible answers, which can also be inferred by the wording of the question, as they are the only choices that refer to a type of article of stationary items.

{"text": "This is a very similar question to one of the earlier questions. It's important to look for patterns and clues in the question.\n\nHere we can look at the phrase \"eating too much dinner\" as an indication that the subject is eating, and that the dinner has left the person with a feeling of satiety. We can assume that they are no longer hungry and the question is now asking us what the most likely result is of them eating what they should not. This will be most likely due to their choice of dish.\n\n1. From this point we are told that \"A: tiredness is likely.\" This tells us that the subject has already eaten and likely already feels the effects, i.e. they are tired. Furthermore, this gives us more information to work with.\n2. We are asked the same question in a different way, \"B: living longer is possible.\" This gives us an alternative to simply the dish being bad for you, and suggests that by eating too much at one sitting can have a benefit which can outweigh the negative.\n3. This question also gives us the answer, \"C: stomach ailment is not likely, because the person has already eaten, and is most likely in pain.  If they were to eat this much in a sitting, the ailment would likely be much more severe than a stomach ache. Finally, this question tells us that \"D: illness is possible,\" which again, is much more severe than simple discomfort.\n4. The last question is a bit tricky to comprehend. On the surface level, the answer seems to be \"E: acid reflux if you are over 40 and not pregnant.\" However, the author may have written this in this way for a reason: to point out that acid reflux can be due to any number of reasons, including a diet rich in spicy and fatty foods, which this dish would most certainly be. This is to say that they are still only giving us options for what could result, but it's still reasonable that the dish could cause acid reflux.\n\nThe most likely answer therefore is: B: living longer is possible but likely A: tiredness is likely, C: Stomach Ache is not likely, D: illness is possible and E: Acid reflux is", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

He was very angry. B. He was shocked. He was startled. C. He became very quiet. D. He panicked. E. He was sad. F. He was surprised. Answer: A: He was very angry.\n\n### Response\nAnswer: B. He was so shocked\n\nWhy:\nIn this case, the sentence provides most of the context for the response, so a straightforward comprehension of the sentence can tell us the appropriate response.\n\nFirstly, according to the sentence, the boyfriend is very surprised to see the car because he had no idea what she had bought him, indicating his \"eyes popped out of his (pink t-shirted) head\". This reveals the shocking nature of the event, leading us to the first few possible responses of A: very angry, B: shocked, and D: panicked. The clue-words \"popped out of his head\" are the most significant ones that help us eliminate the answer choices A: angry and D: panicked, which describe feelings that wouldn't be visible to others.\n\nThe second sentence states that the boyfriend was angry but it is clear that he is shocked rather than angry because the word \"shocked\" is more prominent and \"eyes popped\" is used for emphasis and exaggeration.\n\n### Question: What was the one thing they disagreed on?\n\nQuestion: What was the one other reason they decided it would", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

{"text": "The answer to this problem is \"a math problem.\"\n\nThe phrase \"there are X apples\" suggests a quantity, and the phrase about apples \"falling off\" suggests a process where something is added to and taken away from a quantity. Furthermore, although the question does not ask directly about the falling apples being subtracted from some quantity, it is implied that the falling apples are subtracted out of \"10 apples on the apple tree.\" Finally, the phrase \"math problem\" is commonly used in a context that involves math, and it also references the process of a math problem: taking things away. Therefore, \"X apples\" and the phrase \"falling off\" most closely relate to the structure of a math problem.\n\nSince all of these factors point towards \"math problem\", the correct answer is \"D: math problem.\"\n\n\n### Input:What is this sentence diagram?

{"text": "Input: The text gives us a hint of what activity the subject is scared of and the context suggests that it is some kind of adrenaline sport.\nAnalysis: the words \"to lose consciousness\" tell us that they are not referring to losing consciousness due to death, as they would not be concerned with the possibility of dying given death isn't an issue, it's the loss of consciousness that's scary. This narrows the possible answers down to either C: \"playing uno\" or E: \"falling down\". \nLet's look at their clues:\n- \"playing uno\" refers to the card game UNO, suggesting an outdoor or sports-related context. UNO is a game that has many cards with a design that shows people falling off of cliffs or mountains. The context itself seems to imply that it's related to extreme sports.\n- \"losing consciousness\" provides a clue that may be related to skydiving, as the sport is often done in tandem, where both participants are required to jump out of an airplane while holding onto each other. Losing consciousness while skydiving is actually quite likely, as it happens to many people during the fall due to lack of oxygen as the pressure in the ears shifts.\nThese facts alone would lead one to suppose that \"losing consciousness while playing Uno\" would be the correct answer, but we continue the analysis by looking at the phrases that precede and follow the relevant one-card text.\nWe know that the context involves an adrenaline sport, as the subject is scared.\nThe phrases that make up the paragraph that precedes 'falling down' describe another person that the subject is driving to the airport to pick up, and that the airplane ride is scary in and of itself- that the jump scared them more, or would be a worse situation if something would go wrong. By the description of where they are, the sport is likely also something that takes place during an airplane ride and has something to do with flying, possibly parasailing or skydiving, as they are both the only ones that fit that description in the context.\n\n### Input:\"You had a dream about being in a forest, and then you discovered that you were in the forest, on the edge of a lake.

{"text": "The question asks what could contain no more than 100 people, which is a fairly nonspecific restriction, as most types of venues can contain large groups of people.

We can infer that if it has a special version, it is probably some sort of product of a specialist's work or a specialized field. In the context of vocabulary words, botanical garden is the most likely choice, as it is a place that focuses on plants.\nb: The second line then states that the word, though having a special version, will also have a common version. We can thus narrow our search down to either a: botanical garden or a: ficus plant since only these two options contain both a special and a common version. Of these, the botanical garden makes the most sense as a place where a ficus tree or plant would be found, and indeed it is a place that houses many kinds of plants and trees.

All of the answer choices involve sports, play, or games, so we can rule out throwing things, playing games, and playing chess.\n5.

A botanic garden displays scientific and medicinal plants. This is an unusual place to obtain a rose, given that the question asks about unusual varieties; I find that flower gardens are more likely to contain distinctive varieties of flowers, especially as they often are cultivated for unusual characteristics. \n\nHence the most ideal place to find unusual varieties of rose would be C: a flower garden. \n\nAnswer: C: flower garden\n\n---\n### Instructional example:\n\n### Demostration:\nOutput 1: Write down the most logical answer.\nInput: If you look up the expression [painting the town red](https://www.google.com/#q=painting+the+town+red) how does it come out in your dictionary?

{"text": "The person knew the sun would come out and knew he was going to be okay. Therefore, the correct answer would be the first choice, \"the sun.\"\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration: The sentence starts with \"If you feel like running...\" This implies the action can occur under certain circumstances, and therefore something that is more about choice than an inevitable event.\n\nIn addition, \"you're free to stop whenever you want but don't plan on sleeping for a while.\" This implies that there are two competing choices: \"run\" and \"sleep,\" and the speaker is emphasizing the point that the running is a more active \"do\" than the sleeping, which is a more passive \"be.\"\n\nFurther, \"You can run when you're tired, and that way you\u2019ll still feel like running tomorrow.\" This clue is important because it helps you narrow down the range of choices, in particular because it implies that one is making a choice of whether to run or not at this point. Since the runner is weighing the choice of running or sleeping, the only choice left is \"running,\" which is also what the sentence closes with.\n\n### Input:'If you feel like running, you're free to stop anytime.' Choices:  A & C: A: If you can stop whenever you want to B: C: If you can stop, you're free C: C: if you stop\n\n### Demostration: The question presents two ideas, namely the fact that people can stop running if they want and that they are not obligated to run. The clue 'free' is used in the sentence, indicating a choice. However,'stopping' implies that the runner is doing the running. Therefore, we can logically determine that the runner is in fact the subject.\n\nAnother clue we can use is 'if you can stop whenever you like'. This is an indirect clue, because it does not tell the direct information we need, but it does provide some indirect information, such as the fact that the runner does have a choice and the speaker expects that she can decide on whether to stop or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would have to be C: 'If you stop'.\n\n### Input:\"He knew everything about her and he would show it by", "answer": "C: prepare to go"}

An organization is an entity (or organization), whereas a group of friends are people, so we must be able to discount this answer choice.\n2. The subject of the sentence is \"some people,\" therefore we must be considering the objective of the sentence, which is to be a member of an organization, thus we can use the information that \"organization\" is the answer.\n3.

We could deduce that the meaning in the sentence is likely the same (\"ridden\" here may mean \"confined\" -- if not, they would have had to pick a different word to distinguish the meaning since \"ridden\" and \"confined\" mean different things).\n3. So, we are able to eliminate four out of the five choices with ease: options A, B, C, and E.\n4. If they are both options to be \"ridden,\" then that means getting the benefit is the same as feeling like getting the benefit, and this suggests that the benefit of being \"ridden\" is \"confined.\"\n5. Since the benefit could be a good thing, we need to identify which answer fits the requirements, leaving us with only one remaining choice: C, and we are thus looking for the antonym to \"ridden\" (one answer choice is already out, since that is how it is being used already).\n\n### Input When he got a flat tire, he was unable to get a spare. Therefore, \nhe was A: bored B: bored C: bored D: bored E: bored\n\n### Response This one is a little easier, as \"bored\" is already used in the sentence and there is no antonym (\"confined\") that can be applied to \"bored\" (which is how this", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}
{"text": "A: cupboard\n\n### Rationale:Teakettles aren't meant for water, which means teakettles would be kept somewhere other than water, which narrows down our choices to the other locations that a teakettle could be kept.\n\n### Inputs:I wish to know the price of gasoline? Choices: 1: A: what is the price of gasoline 2: A: what time do you close 3: B: how much is a gallon of gasoline 4: B: when do you open 5: C: how much does a quart of gasoline cost? 6: C: when do you close 7: D: how much does a pint of gasoline cost? Choices: D: what time do you open E: what price is gasoline? Choices D: where can I buy gasoline?\n\n### Rationales:1: \"I wish to know the _________________ of gasoline? Answer: Price of gasoline\n2: \"what time do you close?\"\n3. Price of gasoline is what a customer wants to know, as they are the ones directly affected by it. As gasoline prices rise, gas costs rise, which in turn puts extra strain on the grocery budget for those who depend on cars for transportation. It's logical that a customer is wondering the price since it has an impact on their day-to-day life. If it wasn't, people would be saying, \"how much does gas cost?\"\n4. The question uses the word \"when\" to express time of day. This word, when combined with the question of the time at which the gas station closes, narrows down the possibilities to either \"when do you open\" or \"when do you close.\" However, the sentence structure leaves a bit of doubt about this possibility, as the opening is \"I wish to know...,\" which then ends with \"the price of gasoline.\" There is no subject or object within the second clause, so the first choice (closing/opening) is narrowed even further.\n5. It takes a little more analysis to determine that this question is asking about the price of a quart compared to that of a pint. One can tell that this has to do with gas prices because a quart is another unit of measurement within the gas industry, in the U.S. quarts of gasoline", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

{"text": "Answer: E: sporting goods stores.\n\nDemonstration:\n1. The question tells you that the subjects will need some sports equipment.\n2. The key phrase of the question is \"where\", which refers to a location for where the subjects are likely to need this equipment. If there is a likely location for the equipment, it must be an inanimate object rather than a subject.\n3. \"dicks sporting goods,\" while it is a common sports goods store, is unlikely to be suitable given the subject and the clues provided in the question.\n4. \"sporting event\" is possible but the question does not specify a venue for the event. \n5. \"mall\" is possible, but is more likely to be used to refer to a commercial district or as a general term. There are many more likely places which could be the subject of the question.\n6. If the subject of the question is still a general term that could be applied to an inanimate object as opposed to a subject, then it is \"sports equipment\", the \"sports\" referring to the athletic activity or events that are likely, and the \"equipment\" being the tools or things required for the activity or event.

{"text": "Sally mentions that she was a senior in the house, so this implies that she was in the House of Representatives. She could be either a Democrat, member of the Republican Party, the majority party, the oldest member in the House, member who has served in the House for a long time, the minority party in the House, or a member of any of the various caucuses in the House. So A, B, C, D, and E are possible answers.\n\n### Rationale:\nBased on the fact that Sally was a senior, she must be a member of a house of some sort. However, since being a senior in any house would entail that the person has reached a level equivalent to high school or college and has advanced far in their career. Hence, this places limitations on the possible choices: A.\n\n### Input 2:  Rita was a senior congresswoman.  What might she like to do that would bring more of a  what to her job? Choices:  a: paycheck b: security c: power d: vacation e: job security f: responsibility g: money h: political clout i: status\n\n### Response\n\nRita's age tells us that she is old and has been in the congress for a long time. She must be a member of either the Democratic Party or Republican Party, the majority or minority party in the congress, a member who have been in the congress since a long time, a member who has earned a high reputation among the members of the congress, a senior member of the congress, leader of the Democratic Party or Republican party, or a leader of a certain caucus. So she could be interested in a pay hike, more security, more power, a lengthier vacation, a job promotion, or increased political clout. So A, B.\n\n### Expected rationales\n\n### Rational #1:\nBecause it is stated that Rita is a senior congresswomen, we know that she is old and she's been working as a congresswomen for a long time. Therefore, she probably has worked in this field for a long time. Given her old age, we know that these three choices inevitably occur in the future:\n\n1. A pay raise\n2. Increased security\n3.

{"text": "Rationales: The answer choice E: relax would not be a good fit for the context. The sentence \"Never in a million years did (his) *[x*] that this would happen\" implies that the \"x\" represents an expectation or expectation. \"This\" refers to the \"idea becoming reality,\" which means that the idea was being considered and discussed at some point before being realized, so the \"x\" cannot refer to an idea. Additionally, the person mentioned in the sentence \"never in a million years\" expected or hoped never for the idea to become a reality, which indicates his/her level of commitment and interest in the idea. Hence, the correct choice is D: work hard as this choice implies that the person worked hard to turn the idea into reality, resulting in making it a reality.\n\nAnswer: D: work hard\n\n### Input :He wanted to spend his entire life with his what, which made him feel he was a selfish what? Choices:  a. daughter, son b. mother, father dad c. grandmother, grandfather \n\n### Response :\nRationales: From the sentence \"He wanted to spend his *[x] * with his what\", we can conclude that the \"x\" in the sentence refers to a possession. This implies that the \"x\", i.e. the possession, should have been taken away from the person in order to \"spend the entire life with\" someone else. Therefore, the sentence \"selfish what?\" conveys to us that this person who \"wanted to spend his entire life\" felt selfish for possessing the item in question.\n\nAnswer: a. daughter, son\n\n### Input He knew it was a *[x]* of a decision, he knew that there was another choice, and he knew that one day he would *[y]* regret it forever?

{"text": "B: learn\nExplanation: The instructions tell us: \"What did the business require?\", which implies that what they are required to do will be found out in the next line. The first choice, \"wear shoes\" is an absurdity and a poor guess--they should not be wearing shoes in the store, but that is not what the question is asking. Therefore, the instruction is not \"what do the people walking into the store have to do?\" or \"what is the business requiring people to do?\", and hence options B-D are all incorrect too. Only C and E are possible options, which are also incorrect since nobody needs to \"learn\" anything when they are walking into a store, as this is a basic commuting behaviour.

If the problem is being bitten, these arachnids are not going to cause the problems that you are having.\n\n### Input :The subject wants a solution to a problem and they state that it is a big job. The problem can be explained as a _________.

The problem you identify with the subject is a problem that can be solved by more than one course of action. The question about whether or not the problem is a project or a problem is a good question because it shows you that not everything is as clear-cut as it seems.

Here, the statement is \"It gave her [whatever].\" Therefore, \"what\" in this case is a question tag which means the subject is stating that \"what\" had given her something, which is the object of \"had given\"\n\n### Answer: A.\n\nInput: He told her who he was to the police, but they don't care.

Cupboards are most likely found on upper or middle kitchen walls, so this answer satisfies the first requirement.\n3. Pantries are often used to store staple foods and are found in the kitchen, so this answer satisfies an extra requirement.\n4. Grocery stores and cellars have no relation with where above the kitchen sink one could store canned foods, so these are unsuitable choices.\n5. Canning is a process in which foods are stored in jars, sealed with syrup or melted sugar, then heated with steam, all with the intention of preserving it for a long time. It is not unreasonable to expect one to store canned foods in a kitchen.\nHence the correct answer is A: cupboard, then E: pantry.", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

Alternatively, some part of the statement can be wrong, resulting in an inaccurate conclusion.

{"text": "The correct answer would be A: dimly lit restaurant.\n\n### Details:\n\nThe question asks for the most likely location of a lit candle.\n\nThe question gives us a couple of clues as to the identity of \"a restaurant\":\n\n1. The phrase \"restaurant\" is used exclusively. This rules out birthday cake, kitchen or table, since each of these have the article \"a\" before them; the \"a\" in \"a restaurant\" is the article \"a\" meaning specific, not \"a\" meaning any old one.\n2. The only \"restaurants\" mentioned are dimly lit ones, suggesting we're dealing exclusively with dark, atmospheric night time eateries.\n3. Even though the phrase only mentions lit candles and it could be candles anywhere, we know from the prior statement that if there are lighting, candles should be dimly lit.\n\nThe key takeaway is that we already know of one type of establishment which qualifies: dimly lit restaurant\n\nThere are four answers, so the only ones which could rule out dimly lit restaurant are \n`a`, `c`, and `d`. Since the question isn't concerned with how dimly lit (meaning, only lighted or brightly lit versus moderately or darkly lit) so we can just assume it's a lit candle. So it must be a candle and must be dim in the restaurant.\n\nFrom there, we can deduce from the clues provided that the only logical choice is a dimly lit restaurant, A.\n\n### Inputs:Who is in charge of the dunk tank for the charity fundraiser?

{"text": "Answer: C: potential\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. The first sentence gives us a lot of information about the narrator's situation:  \"People always....\" This strongly implies that other characters' behavior and interactions are what we should pay attention to, and not vice versa.\n2. The second sentence, describing his disability, further reinforces this idea. While the narrator might indeed have a disability that affects his physical ability, it does not at all affect his mental capacity. For this reason, the text makes it clear that the narrator is highly intelligent, but that others perceive him as simple because of his physical difficulties. The clue here is \"childlike,\" which is a term generally applied to intellectually underdeveloped or immature people. The narrator could have a developmental disorder, or he could be mentally retarded, but these are both characterized by a decline in mental capacity, rather than by the increase typically seen when an individual grows or matures, which would be better characterized by the term \"potential.\" This is also why the narrator's physical disability is disregarded completely as it does not affect either his mental capacity or his perceived maturity.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice question...\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question asks us to guess which business uses a bunch of potatoes. We want to figure out which choice is a word that would be used to describe a business. \"Fast food restaurant\" and \"vegetable market\" would be used to describe food-related businesses, like restaurants and grocery stores. \"Ireland\" is related to the country, and its people. However, I think it is more likely that in answering the question, the writer meant the country of origin of the potato, which would be one of the following: Russia, Germany, the UK, or United States. Since the UK is the country that many Americans think of in regard to potatoes, I think \"fast food restaurant\" and \"Ireland\" are unlikely to be correct.\n2. \"Dessert spots\" might describe bakeries, but they tend to use less potatoes, and desserts typically cost more than most meals.  Therefore, I would first go to a fast food restaurant or, since Ireland is not likely to be the correct country of origin, to a produce market or a vegetable market.  These are the most likely options.\n\n### Answer: D: produce market  (Producer: a company that produces or manufactures a product; Grocer: a person who sells food and household supplies or a shop that sells them.\n\n### Input:\"What do people usually do after a good meal? \" Choices: A: get a nap B: go back to work C: play a round of golf D: go shopping E: go for a walk\n\n### Demostration:\n1.

For example, after someone finishes a big meal they usually might want to play a sport like basketball, do some exercise, or something.\n3. This question is asking us about people and how they act after a pretty good meal.

{"text": "E: animals\n\n- The question itself has limited context details about the setting, but it is clear that an animal is the subject.\n\n- The use of the word \"beaver\" indicates that the animal is of the large beaver species, which are native to the northern parts of North America.\n    - The habitat of these animals, in addition, is rivers and lakes, which are often found in North America.\n- The phrase \"structures to block\" implies that the animals have some means of attack or defense, such as by raising dams or blockages. This points toward their natural environment, as other animals must \"block\" or be blocked by them for other reasons.\n- The phrase is also vague in terms of the structure and features it refers to; it indicates \"structures to block,\" rather than specific structures. Additionally, the word used for \"feature\" is generic and not specific, so this is not a strong clue (even if it were specific, \"structures to block [specific feature]\" would rule out most options).\n- The question provides a generic set of answers choices for us to choose from: \"books,\" \"zoo,\" \"body of water,\" \"wooded area,\" and \"animal.\"\n- For all options, the answers are not a definitive match in each case. For example, while \"zoo\" suggests a set of animals, it does not indicate a type of habitat. In addition, \"body of water\" suggests something like an open river, lake, ocean, etc.; an animal that resides in an enclosed area (i.e. one that cannot freely swim between different types of water) is not a good match for this definition.\n- The animals are still not matched, however; there must be something to determine which one it is.\n- The only available hints come from the phrase \"beaver dams,\" which references another way in which beavers use their water-logging abilities to their favor. This could potentially indicate that these structures are built toward blocking water, though it is not definitive. Additionally, the beavers build many dams for such purposes, and the question is specific to structures, so these dams could be excluded on that basis.\n- This leaves us with \"body of water\" and \"wooded area.\" Both of these indicate something to do with the environment, however \"body of water\" does not mean the same as \"animal", "answer": "C: body of water"}

The problem does not specify whether any of these solutions are acceptable or unacceptable, which means it is up to the player to decide whether the solution in the question meets the requirement.

We use the English language to teach Italian restaurants.\n\n### Business:\nA business restaurant is likely to be located in a business district where there is a large number of businesses and professionals. This is so restaurants can target a large number of potential customers and there is enough traffic to generate revenue. A business district would also be easy for a customer to find and conveniently located near many other businesses.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks us where an Italian restaurants would likely be located. The context suggests that we are talking about a formal, business-oriented restaurant, rather than a casual tavern or dive. The given options are B: at hotels, C: malls, D: business sectors, E: yellow pages. These are obviously not appropriate for an Italian business restaurant.\n\nIf we assume that the target demographic of the restaurant being discussed is adult professionals, an option that makes sense is A: town, as adult professionals are more likely to go to a restaurant in town where there is a larger number of potential customers. Malls are popular with children and young adults, whereas older adults are more likely to eat out at restaurants in town. However, malls can still cater to adults, as older adults may spend time with their families there. B: at hotels is inconclusive, as hotels cater to a wide variety of demographics.\n\nThe question states that the restaurant is likely to be Italian, which can be interpreted in a few different ways. This could mean that an Italian restaurant is an attractive concept to the given market, as it would be relatively unknown or unavailable in the area. It could also mean that the restaurant is going to cater to a largely Italian niche of people, which is most likely the case when the term \"business district\" is also mentioned. The given answer options do not take into account the business context here, but rather focus on the geographic locations. Business restaurants are more likely to be located in business districts and town centers than in malls and hotels.\n\nIf the question had asked where restaurants of a particular type are likely to be located, we would be able to answer the question solely on the basis of the given context and the linguistic content of the question.", "answer": "D: business sector"}

Choices:  A : no question ask the boss  B : no raise for now and let us see how i do C : quit my job  D : tell the boss \n\n### Answer:\n\n### Solution :\n\nThe answer is definitely B because if I feel my job isn't good, or the salary isn't good, so I don't want the job anymore, so I should quit my job.\n### 1st Point :\n\nBecause quitting a job means you already don't like your job, or the salary is not good. So you should not want a promotion.\n\n### 2st Point :\n\nThe first reason why I disagree with the right answer is because quitting a job has a huge affect on many things in you life. \nFor Example, quitting a job causes your resume a big blow, a big gap in your resume means that some of your work experience is not there, this is a problem because resume is one of the important factors which people use to recruit you. If the recruiters find your resume looks bad, they'll think that you are maybe not good at your work, maybe you have a problem with you or something.", "answer": "B: skill"}

However, the cat is described as having a strong sense of belonging to a particular spot, such as an alley.

C is not really applicable to music  (how would listening to music cause you \"smile\"), and D is also improptu, as if \"what could listening to music cause to you be\" and the follow-on phrase is grammatically correct (a different case of \"to you be\" would be appropriate if the question were \"What could listening to music _be_ for you?\"), \"a happy\" would not be grammatically correct.\n\n### So the last question we need to answer is 4.

{"text": "The rationale for this answer is the following:\n \n1. The first step of processing was finding what the question says. The question includes the word \"nothing\". From this we can draw logical inference that the answer needs to be in contradiction to nothing.\n \n2. We analyzed the possible answer words in the question.\n    - \"Get\" has to do with taking action, so that's not an option\n    - \"Fat\" is a body function. So not that either.\n    - \"Type\" means writing, or sending a text message. \"Wasted\" has to do with time, \"typ\" would not be a viable word option. \"Sleep\" is the natural action your body does when the other options are not in action.\n\nThe shortest possible words that the question could be saying would be \"E:Wasted\" which would make sense grammatically, is it the shortest logical word choice, which makes it the answer.\n\nHence, the correct answer is E: wasted time.\n\n- - - \nAn explanation for this response :\n1. Get fat\n - Actions\n2. Get Fat\n - Actions\n3. Get falling asleep\n - Actions\n4. Get into wasted time\n - Does a specific action that includes no other actions\n5.

I am not interested in that problem. D. I don\u2019t believe a problem like that will occur.\nRationales:\n\n1. 'none of your business.' is the answer.

So the 'he' is the one who needs to do this to solve the problem. The first clue that helps the reader is the subject-verb agreement, saying 'his ability to do his job'.

{"text": "In the instructions, the text says, \"The sample needed to be...\" In some sentences, words can take on the role of an attribute. For instance, \"The professor...\" If a relative clause begins with \"which,\" it usually means that the verb preceding \"which\" has a special, implied meaning. For example:\n\n\"The person, who is sitting in the middle chair in the conference room, is the new hire.\"\n\"The conference room, where the meeting is being conducted, has a long, oval-shaped table with nine chairs around it.\"\n\nWhen a sentence begins with \"which,\" the sentence is sometimes read in this special, implied way. As an exercise, try reading the sentence out loud in this way! The verb preceding \"which\" is \"needed.\" Because \"needed\" is a noun phrase, we can re-read the sentence as \"The sample...\" and \"which\" will be a pronoun (\"The sample...\" = \"Which...?\"). \"Needed\" would therefore have an implied meaning, most logically \"to be pure.\"\n\nIn your response, you'll need to show how information from a prior sentence is being applied to the current sentence.

{"text": "To answer this question we must first identify the subject that is being questioned and then make sure we understand what they mean by what they are asking.\n\nWe see an interesting sentence structure here, where there is a question that has three choices that are not mutually exclusive (i.e. they don't refer to the same thing). To properly interpret a sentence containing this structure, we should identify each choice individually and assess the plausibility of each, but before we begin doing that, it is important to understand how our brains process written text.\n\nEvery written word (spoken or written) should not be taken at face value - we must understand the context of the question and make sure we are not looking for answers that make no sense for the context. If we look at a random sentence, such as \"I want to make a living with it [tongue]\" does it make sense to you to say it refers to eating or talking with your tongue? Of course not, it simply refers to some instrument, but in a lot of contexts we simply take the words at their face value, and don't realize what we have misinterpreted.\n\nIn our context, we can see that the answer choices are meant to be related to things that may be \"views\" of the road, which are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThe problem is, we have some phrasing that doesn't make sense as far as how we see highway roads: \"line of a country highway\"\n\nThis phrase makes no sense because a road is not a line, it consists of many things. We are looking for something that has something to do with a line (we could assume line of the road?). In that context, the answer choice that makes sense is D: line. \n\nNow we can start looking at the choices, the choices are all about lines and/or being in a line. \n\nChoice A makes no sense because line could be interpreted as the intersection for planes flying over.

The phrasing of \"might you\" suggests that the question will be about an event which might take place or is possible but may not, hence it cannot be something like a birthday party or movie since these things are definite, and the cake will have either been served or not served on this occasion. Moreover, the text explicitly mentions the ice cream, so the cake will have to be served alongside ice cream. Finally, the phrase \"with your ice cream\" strongly suggests that the question will not be about what you serve cake with at a specific event, but about a cake you might serve with ice cream, possibly for various events. On the other hand, serving cake at a party and serving cake in a freeze are events which are definite, so these options cannot be a right answer either. For these reasons, \"With your ice cream\" and \"served cold\" are the main clues we have to lead us to answer the questions. As long as we serve the cake with ice cream and serve it cold, a party will suffice to complete the question. On the other hand \"served cold\" leaves us with the main clues: We do not need serve cake with ice creams, and we do not need to serve them at a party.\n\nA:\n- Cake is served with ice cream: this will be a party with ice creams\n- Ice cream is", "answer": "C: party"}

If I had one million left over after buying the 256 million house, then I am short by $130 million, $146 million, or $160 million.\nHowever, if we go by the fact that the extra money is $25 million and then the house is selling at $281 million and the person left with some money, that's why $281 million can be obtained by adding or subtracting some amount or if subtracting some amount then the amount is just $25 million.

{"text": "Answer: D. park\nThe clue that tells us not to use a park for directions is the \"developed land.\" This implies that a \"developed land\" is not a park. So the only choices that do not use the word \"developed land\" in the clue are C (not D) E (not C). So if we're traveling on a park and we don't see any buildings, we should consider using an atlas or a countryside.\n\n### Explanation:\nThere is a lot of information included in the word \"developed,\" which may be difficult to use as we answer the question. But we can get to the core idea behind the words much easier by analyzing the words individually rather than together. This makes the word \"developed\" have some meaning within the puzzle without necessarily meaning that it is unreasonable or confusing.\n\"developed\" could be defined simply as being built in a community. With that knowledge, we should focus simply on identifying community areas that are not built, and therefore have to rely on a map or atlas in order to find their way. This information tells us the clue is in the category of countryside, which is the only choice that does not include the word \"developed.\"\n\n### Examples:\n> Input: if something was made on an assembly line what might you expect from the project as opposed to an independent venture?\n>\n> Answer: A. more standard products, less variation\n\n![an assembly line](/assets/pic_assemblyline.png)\n\n### Exemplar\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the question.\n\n## In what year was John F.

{"text": "A: control people\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales:\nThe question asks the user to choose something someone might do after arguing with someone about money. We can divide the question into \n    - The first sentence is \"Johnny and bill fought _over money_.\" We know that a fight over money is going to be focused on money, and likely to involve some anger, but it makes no mention of physical violence or other aspects, so _control people_ is a good option.\n    - The next sentence mentions that Johnny wants \"it to be over.\" This implies that Johnny wants Bill to get out of his hair for a little bit, so _settle everything_ is ruled out.\n    - The remaining two, _buy food_ and _increase power_, are possible answers, but are not specifically mentioned in the passage. Because _control people_ is already the most plausible answer, all we are left with are two more plausible choices to eliminate, and since food does not seem to be at all relevant to the passage and power may seem a little far fetched, _buy food_, is ruled out in favor of _control people_. Hence, the correct answer choice, _control people_ would be the appropriate response to this question.\n### Answer: A: control people.\n\n### Inputs :An employee at some time or another, may have asked for a raise.

Hence, the correct choice would be yes he was a good employee. Answer: B : yes he was a good worker\n\n### Input :  A: you should be a lawyer B:  what did you do in the past?

Which of the following was most likely the reason the person of Tina might have a problem with sneeze? Choices: A: Allergic to flowers. B: Forget to breathe. C: Allergic to anything. D: Breathing with the nasal cavity. E: Smell with the nose tip.\n\nResponse:\n\n1. Tina's sudden realization that she no longer recognizes the smell of flowers meant that her olfactory system, which gives us the ability to smell, is no longer functional.\n\n2. Her inability to recognize the smell of pollen means that her olfactory system is damaged or malfunctioning.\n\n3. C: \"Allergic to anything\" is the best answer since the person in Tina is suffering from an allergy, which causes the body to release histamine, a chemical that reduces fluid in the nasal cavity, causing the nose to swell up and block the nose.\n\n4. B: \"Forgetting to breathe\" is an incorrect answer since it cannot affect Tina's sneeze.\n\n5. A: \u201cAllergic to flowers\u201d is the incorrect answer. \n\n6.

{"text": "What is someone watching a 10-year-old play guitar doing? Choices A&B or B&C or A&C\n1. A, which is hearing music, is an action verb that does not have to do with the guitar, and \"watching while auditioning can be done while listen to music or hear music.\n2. D, which is playing music, is an action that must take place if the guitar is to be heard, but it does not necessarily require watching, and someone can listen to music.\n3. We do not say \"is someone watch a someone play guitar,\" so answer choices C or E do not make sense.\n\n### Correct answer: listening\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\nThe question is about someone watching \"something that someone is listening to.\" The \"someone\" in the question is doing the listening. It is the the person doing the listening who is doing the watching. The person performing the listening action is listening to music, \"the music someone is playing.\" It is not the playing the guitar which one \"is watching\" during. One might watch someone else listen to music, which is an action independent of listening to music.\n\n### Hints:\n\n1. The context is someone watching somebody else listening to music, so the listener would be doing the listening and would be \"watching\" it.\n2. The question includes a reference to \"music,\" so we know that it is listening to music that is taking place, and we can eliminate those verbs that are not related, such as playing.\n3. It suggests that the listener is \"watching\" something, which may be related to someone else, so that they might be \"watching someone play music.\" However, the listener may be the person playing, and so a simple \"seeing\" would serve.\n4. The same person is doing the \"listening\" and \"watching,\" or \"doing them together.\" Hence we can ignore verbs with more than one action performed simultaneously, since the listener could potentially be doing one or the other.\n5. The context refers to \"listening\" to someone else, so the listener is actually someone \"watching them\" which is a \"listening\" to them. The listener is \"watching someone\" (someone else) \"listen.\" This is what is being \"watched\" by the listener, or \"watching\" that listener", "answer": "C: listening to music"}

{"text": "Demostration: \nWe know that bleachers are most likely to be used for sports, particularly team sports such as baseball, soccer, and basketball. To determine the location that best matches bleachers is movies, opera, theater, or a lecture hall, we first need to understand the relationship between bleachers and each of these venues.\n\nSeats on movies are usually arranged in a linear manner, and their layout is often similar to that of theater seating. As a general rule, theater performances are often presented in front of proscenium stages, which are the most typical types of stages used by theaters. Opera and lecture halls are less likely to use bleachers than the other options and therefore cannot be the location in this problem.\n\nHockey games normally have seats on each side of the rink, but they also commonly have bleachers in the north and south ends of each rink for additional seating. Bleachers can also be seen at college football venues, though they are not as common as they once were.\n\nSince movie seats are usually arranged in a similar manner, the answer is movies.\n\nAnswer:\n\n### Input : The pump spouts were emptied with water.

{"text": "A: empowering\n\n### Justification:\n1. We can analyze the keywords in the question:\n    - \"unintentionally\": suggests that either this is an act of omission (failure to take action or prevent damage), or that the subject has been unaware of or oblivious to the harm they caused due to some reason.\n    - \"hurting someone else\": indicates that the harms someone else is suffering, which again suggests a harm of omission such as failing to take proper precautions or provide adequate assistance.\n    - \"unable to stop\": is a further clue that the harm itself is something the subject has had no control over, and thus likely to be unaware of or unable to stop.\n    - \"likely to feel\": indicates that the subject in question has likely already felt some of these negative emotions about the harm caused as a result of being unaware that they are responsible for it.\n2. Taking this information into account, the most logical answer is C: sadness.

E: having to deal with unruly students\nRationales:\n\n- If the subject is happy about something, this suggests she\u2019s satisfied or even content.\n- The question also tells us that the speaker is someone who has experienced more than one year in this field, as only after that year would we be justified in asking a broad overview of her experiences.\n- The phrase \"doing homework at night\" also points to satisfaction: there is nothing better than that first year where one doesn\u2019t have to worry about bringing home work home! It\u2019s a year of pure freedom and fun!\n- The phrase \"having to deal with unrully students\" also gives us a hint that the job isn\u2019t too difficult, since only difficult or challenging work would give one stress or cause one to have difficulty.\n- On the other hand, the phrase \"having a low turnover in classroom\" would suggest otherwise: if there\u2019s been a low rate of students leaving her class, the subject is likely to have had many difficulties in her first year. This is the kind of difficulty we might expect from a challenging or difficult field, in other words, it\u2019s what we\u2019d expect from a tough first year of teaching, and is therefore the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: B: Teaching was challenging but she\u2019s happy with she does.\n\n### Final output and instructions:\n\n*If a speaker said, \"How is your boyfriend?\" you might respond with,*\n\n*A: He\u2019s busy.

{"text": "Input: Answer: A\n\n### Demostration:\n1. We can see the words \"fishing rod\" which gives us some idea of where we should look for a fishing rod. Also, the context is that the rod is for fishing, which would be unlikely with a furniture store unless it also sold fishing supplies.\n2. In terms of logical consistency, it does not make sense to go to a furniture store to buy a fishing rod because it is inappropriate. Buying fishing equipment and furniture could cause confusion and conflict.\n3. Although the furniture store may have a few rods on the racks, it is unlikely that it would sell a wide variety of rods, especially at a reasonable price.\n4. The word \"sporting\" implies something athletic or recreational such as athletic clubs, sporting fields, or sporting merchandise that facilitates sporting activities. Even if a sporting goods store sells fishing rods, they sell other types of rods too because they aren't a fishing store.\n5. It does not make sense to a hardware store to sell rods, fishing-related equipment and supplies would not be available there nor would it make logical sense for the owner of a hardware store to sell a wide variety of equipment and supplies for sports which is not logical.\n6. An engine could refer to a device for generating mechanical power\n\n### Solution for the question: \nIt is possible to buy a fishing pole at a sporting goods store, however, in the context of that line of inquiry, it is more likely that such a device is not available on the grounds that the location of the fishing pole is more important than the form that the fishing pole should take, which is likely to be on a more permanent basis as opposed to on a temporary scale. Therefore, the most logical place to buy a fishing line is at a retail establishment, such as a hardware supply store or sporting goods store.", "answer": "D: sporting goods store"}

Choices :  A: gratitude  B: satisfaction   C: illness D : let down E: respect \n\nRationales:\n\n1. First, let us disregard the words \"the entire month\" because they are not directly relevant to the question and provide no information about our subject.\n2. Next, we can eliminate the words \"still had nothing to show for\", because they are vague and do not provide any concrete information about the result of our subject's favors.\n3. Looking at the remaining phrase, we can narrow our answer further: \"nothing to show for it\" refers to the subject's efforts or favors, and the use of \"it\" gives a more specific indication, especially when combined with the context of the first phrase. Hence, we can conclude that the subject had \"done favors for everybody at [their] work\" at some point, and was left with no \"gratitude\" or \"respect\" for having done so. The correct answer, therefore, is D: a let-down.", "answer": "E: gratitude"}

{"text": "A: carnival\n\n### Rationale:\n- It's an exaggeration to ask you if you've ever seen a penguin with a turned bum.\n\n### Input : You should stop and consider whether you have a valid reason to be late before just throwing your hands up and giving up. Choices:  A : Yes B : No C : No and don't give up D : Give up and just give up\n\n### Rationales: 1. The verb \"throw\" suggests that the subject is \"throwing their hands up in the air\" or somehow resigning.\n2. The word \"just\" in front of \"give up\" would normally mean \"right now,\" which suggests that giving up is an action they've already decided or committed to rather than an action they could do or change their mind about.\n\n3. The most logical answer here would be D: Give up and just give. This not only explains the meaning of the blurb in the best way, but also matches the phrasing with the given clues in the problem. If there is no good excuse for the subject's lateness, giving up without a fight is the appropriate choice.\nHence, a logical response to this blurb would be \"Give up and just give up.\"\n\n\n\n\n### Input (SAT/ACT):Which one of the following refers to the people who originally lived in the lands that are now the united states?

Therefore, Amerindians must be the people who originally lived on the lands that are now known as the United States.

{"text": "Rationales:\n1. The question tells as that the subject is deciding between watching television and playing with their cell phone in bed. This suggests that they likely struggle with staying awake, rather than with learning.\n2. The question asks \"might be a routine\" which indicates this is a daily activity rather than one-off task with specific instructions or instructions that change on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. This helps to narrow the choice down to a routine that people likely do every day (in this case, going to sleep).\n3. The question also asks which of these two activities \"help to do what\". Since the answer is to have a phone, but we know that \"fall asleep\" would not do this and we know that TV has no correlation to being able to do this, we can quickly eliminate A and E since those choices are inconsistent with the question. That leaves us with B and C, which must each fulfill the role of help the subject be able to \"do what.\"\n4. Since B provides no help in the subject falling asleep, we can eliminate it as a logical choice. The question also asks for \"might be a [routine]\", so we know that the correct answer is a routine answer that people do multiple nights in a row. We already know that TV is not one of these activities, leaving us with only one answer: C, which provides no distraction, but helps the subject stay awake to play with their phone, which ultimately leads to sleep.

{"text": "1. If someone \"works in the office,\" this suggests that they spend large amounts of time there and that their job consists of sitting at a computer and \"doing something,\" without specifying what.\n2. The phrasing is significant here as well: \"His day at the _______ was nearing an end\" suggests that he is nearing the day's end not just his own (if the latter, we would likely expect the subject to \"pack up\" or say goodbye to coworkers, etc. rather than \"do something\" with their PC, which might be viewed as more of a side activity than a necessary \"work\"-related thing to do).\n3. The rest of the sentence also suggests that they are nearing the end of the day and thus the PC's workday.\n4. A \"start menu\" is a software feature common in computer OSes like Windows and OS X that allows the user to launch programs or files they are trying to open or use; it is usually located at the bottom of the screen, below the Dock or taskbar on a MAC.\n5. Finally, the context of the sentence - as in that the subject is contemplating turning off their computer on the last day of the working week - strongly suggests using a term like \"reason\" or \"logical explanation,\" more in line with \"power down,\" \"control model,\" \"reason for,\" \"reason to,\" \"control mode,\" or \"turn off.\"\nThe question then becomes one of determining whether the \"reason exists\" in the person themselves, the company, the computer, or the person's relationship with the computer (computers sometimes have relationships, too - don't get too anthropomorphic about it, and let's focus on practicality, not subjectivity).\nIn this case, the \"reason\" is the \"day is over,\" not the person or company. Thus the answer should be a word related to shutting off a computer or other device: power down, shut down, turn off, or control model.

Choices: A: talking B: thinking C: sleeping D: drinking E: working \n\n### Demo Explanation: The question is asking what the people in the company do most of the time. We can analyze the question piece by piece: 1. \"In the company office, a a lot of people want what?\". This suggests that the subject is talking about a group of people all having the same desire or goal. \n2. \"But they spend most of the t time what? \" the phrase \"but they spend most of the T time what? This gives three clues: \" a lot\" (they have a lot of people), \"spend\" (the goal is of importance), and \"time\" (the goal requires a lot of time or effort).\n3. Taking these clues into account, we can answer confidently that the most logical answer to the question is E: working,\" since it is the only answer choice that contains the phrase \"the most of the time.\" Hence, the correct answer to this question is D: working.\nAnswer:D: working", "answer": "C: superior"}

The right answer would be the one that is both likely to happen and has a positive outcome.\n\nSince efficiency describes something that can accomplish goals with little effort, it is the best answer here. It is likely to happen, as the planning of a wedding is typically the responsibility of the couple, as opposed to other options like marriage (a union), getting-work-done (another unrelated action) or finishing-up (a common and unimportant goal for events related to weddings).\nThe most likely outcome will be the successful completion of the wedding. Hence, the right answer is A: efficiency.\n\n## Answer: A: efficiency\n\n### Demostration: \n<a href = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbYMuG_oqvw\">link to the video</a>\n\n### Solution:\n### First:\nGiven that it is the end of the day and that a meeting was held, it can be inferred that the meeting was important and was about a high-stress situation. The question then follows: what did the subject do in the meeting? The options all focus on how the subject reacted to something and to what results a reaction could have.\n\n### Second:\nWe can see that the subject took a defensive attitude during the meeting. This means that they disagreed with something. We can then infer that the meeting was about something potentially contentious, as disagreements are common in such situations. In the other options, neither the subject nor the situation was characterized in the given manner. This suggests that the subject disagreed on how it was presented to the public after being presented.\n\n### Third:\nFor a disagreement, one common solution is to propose an alternative version. We can then infer, given that the subject proposed an alternative, that they did not agree with the final decision of the meeting. Hence, the correct option would be E: Results.\n\n### Answer: E: Results", "answer": "C: marriage"}
{"text": "Answer: B. Conference\n\n### Explanation\nThe answer must provide a definition of the question's noun in order to answer a multiple choice question correctly. If the question was simply asking for a synonym in place of the noun, it would be asking for a synonym, not the definition of the word noun. In the question about a new movie, the question asked for a person to see the movie at the correct pronunciation of the word movie. If one wants to buy a new movie, they would usually go to a movie store, while if they want to watch a new movie in a theater, they have to see that movie for the correct noun. Thus, to find the correct answer, one must see if the word is a correct pronunciation of movie, or not. In this case, the correct answer is conference, because if one wants to watch a new movie, they don't refer to the theater as the conference or the bathroom, but, instead, they refer to it as the theater or the restroom. The question's context also further suggests that the people talking are likely to be planning to go to a new movie, as if they were going to a movie theater or restroom.\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Examine the following multiple choice question carefully.\n\n### Input. I'll take the extra what: 1. A: shifts 2. B: baked goods C: free time D: time 3.

{"text": "In a logical world where things make sense, one could easily say that what you asked for was \"a good place to keep my chess pawn.\" However, what you asked for was actually something to \"store\" your pawn. To store something is to have a location to put it, thus I would assume that you were looking for an appropriate container or storage option for your pawn, rather than a physical location (since this can clearly be said in a single word and doesn't involve a process of selecting the right thing from those given). For this reason, option A, B, and C are all incorrect, as they would simply be physical locations. E is also incorrect, as a small case refers to cases in which the pawns themselves are kept in separate cases or containers. Hence, the correct option is D: chess game, as this involves selecting a physical container to use in storing the pawn.\n\n### Input : A man was driving through a state when he came upon a speed trap.

The question is asking for a specific type of a building; a building that is made only for staff. This is a building like a dorm or apartment. Where do students typically live? In a dormitory! This question is asking for a building with dorm rooms in it, which is why the answer is most likely a college.\n\nThis question is also similar to a different question we have worked on.

{"text": "### Solution:\n\nAnswer: The question does not provide enough clues and details to narrow it down to one particular situation. From the clues provided (\"the only baggage\" and \"the drawstring bag\") it is not clear whether the woman checked in her baggage beforehand, whether the bag was checked in along with her luggage, or whether she checked the bag in later. The only scenario that can be confidently rejected is the jewelry store option: it's unclear why the woman would need to check in a bag at a jewelry store.\n\nThe other four options do not clearly conflict with the other, so they are each plausible enough to warrant consideration. Some of the options are more likely than others, however. For instance, \"the drawstring bag\" would be the kind of bag one might carry around in the airport or with them on a flight. Thus, while A: garbage can is not impossible (perhaps the person checked out a hotel and threw the bag away), airport: A: garbage can seems the least likely solution. The only other option that is not impossible is B: traveling military officer: drawstring bag; however, other clues in the question suggest that this is not the case. For example, the phrase \"the only baggage she checked\" indicates that this is the only checked bag that the person has. There is no way for a military officer or other traveler to check-in only a single bag. So, E: airport is most likely.\n\nThe clues given in the prompt also make it clear that the woman will travel with a bag in addition to her luggage, and the question does not ask about whether the woman also checked in luggage. Thus, the bag that was checked in must be the only luggage that the woman is bringing, and the drawstring bag must be with the checked luggage. This also means that A: garbage can is impossible, which further supports the \"E: airport\" answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is most likely \"E: airport.\"\n\nAnswer: E: airport \n\n## Write a request like this: \n\nWrite a response that correctly completes the request. \n\n## Instruction:\n\n## Rationales:\n\n## Answer:\n\n###", "answer": "E: airport"}

His email is overloaded and it makes him scream out, so he decides to read his coworkers\u2019 emails and answer to them, without any reading his emails and the only thing he has to do is checking the tasks he has to finish at end of the year. After doing that, he feels great and, at 12 o\u2019clock, before getting to lunch, he checks if he has any new email, and after he checks the new email, he has lunch. After lunch, he waits for his boss and he asks him if he should leave. When he gets back to his office, he checks if he had any emails, but he didn\u2019t.

The phrases \"what,\" \"good job,\" and \"to do\" immediately provide significant clues. \"What\" refers to the task to be completed, and \"good job\" describes something that has already been completed. This combination of phrases indicates that something has been done, and is further reinforced by the sentence beginning with \"to do.\"\n2. Combining this with the clues provided in the question, there are  four possibilities that fit the requirements as given: \"task,\" \"project,\" \"employee,\" or \"worker.\" Taking the context of the problem into account, we can narrow them down to either \"task\" or \"worker\" as the correct answers.\n\n3.

{"text": "The correct answer is D: vomiting.\n\n### Reason: By \"gets angry after getting drunk,\" the author implies that the drunk person is likely to engage in acts of rage or other inappropriate behavior. The author further suggests that the anger might be directed at objects in motion - \"falling down\" or \"vomiting,\" both of which involve bodily functions and motions. Thus, given what we know from reading the sentence, it's quite likely that the drunk person will vomit - as opposed to \"talk to\" or \"laugh at,\" for example. The rest of the sentence only reinforces this logical deduction, as it mentions that the person will violate \"other people's rights\" while drunk, which is an instance of violent behavior. If the drunk person doesn't vomit, then he or she is more likely to assault other people, which will surely implicate a lower standard of conduct, but one is not likely to be as severe as it would be if the individual were to vomit and then violate others' rights. \n\n### Instructions: In this situation, you have to talk to two of the girls - Alice and Charlotte- about the new fashion trend. It is really tough for you since you are not familiar with the fashion and you have little time to prepare.\n\n### Scenario: Alice told you that she would follow current fashion trends when it is convenient for her.

Alice said she has noticed a number of girls carrying purses with metal chains, too.

Choices: A: distraction B: procrastination C: rebel D: diligence E: perfectionist\n\n### Demostration:\n    - The context indicates that the subject is already acting irresponsibly; this would be unlikely to be in reference to a student who procrastinates or diligently completes their work.\n    - We are told that the subject is acting unprofessionally, so this indicates something serious and professional, in the work context.\n    - We further notice that the subject is acting irresponsibly with their work, which means that they are not keeping it organized/properly maintained. They could be using their workspace improperly or not completing it at all. However, to be irresponsible with this subject would not necessarily mean that they are being unprofessional.\n    - \"Rebel\" is a negative, and would indicate an unprofessional and immature attitude\u2014an idea that is opposed by the context indicating professionalism.\n    - \"Procrastination\" or \"Perfectionism\" would similarly not be appropriate, if the idea was that the subject had irresponsibly allowed himself to become an unprofessional rebel who wasn't getting his work done, yet he wouldn't be procrastinating to such a degree that he is unprepared or hasn't met the deadline/completed his assigned task, nor is he perfectioning to such a degree that his work would be irreparably incomplete. He would still lack in one or both of these respects.\n    - \"Diligence\" would also be unlikely if they did not complete their work, or had done an adequate job finishing it.\n    - Hence, the obvious answer would be E: \"Professional irresponsibility\" which we learn about here: [CRA_10 - Finding Information and Solving Problems](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/crawford-2010-writing-genre-confer-ac-reading-inference-skills-reading-for-comprehension) or the [CRA_15 - Reading Informative Texts](https://www2.ed.gov/s", "answer": "B: arrest"}

{"text": "Rationales:\n### The question is asked in an introductory manner. That is, it does not have an initial question mark, and the answer must start with a capital letter in accordance with normal grammar. The first clue provided in the problem to lead us to the correct answer is the word \"company\". We can reasonably deduce that this means \"a group of individuals\" or \"a business,\" as this type of group setting is unpopular with many people.\n\n### We are then told that Sam left John outside, implying that Sam didn't like him coming. This tells us that the first answer choice, \"You,\" is impossible. The person that Sam didn't appreciate coming was John, a specific individual, so the correct response is \"John\".\n\n### We can then conclude that the answer choice \"solitude\" is false, as \"Solitude\" refers to isolation from people, not necessarily from a group. This leaves us with two options: \"loneliness,\" in which \"alone\" is not used as an adverb, and \"alone,\" in which the word \"loneliness\" may be assumed to be the adjective describing a noun or pronoun (if \"someone\" is plural, which it is not). Since \"loneliness\" does not appear again in the passage, the most logical answer is \"alone\" because \"loneliness\" only refers to a state. This can be seen in the sentences \"He prefers alone\" and \"He prefers to be alone\".\n\n### The most logical solution is option D\n\n### Input :  I had a wonderful day.

Taking our answers together, the Tea Party has to be one of them. This is because nothing else relates to the Tea Party. However, the Tea Act refers to the same event as the Tea Party; hence, we cannot select A, for the 1774 Tea Act is a consequence of the Tea Party.\n2. The American Revolution occurs in 1775, after the Tea Party, so we can discount this as well.\n3. The Boston Tea Party was not a civil war.\n4. The Stamp Act did not occur until 1765; hence, this cannot be the correct answer.\n5.

{"text": "Answer: We are given information that a couple of friends wanted to spend an evening together. We are further given that they went somewhere to see something. We can interpret that they went somewhere to spend time together.\n\nSo, we start by asking: when do people spend time together? The most common opportunities for people to spend time together are when they are getting something done that involves another person, or are going to a place that another person goes to.\n\nHmm, this brings us to a real problem: we are given that they went somewhere. What does it mean when people go to a place? Well, it means they go where they can do something. So, if we think about everything they could \"do\" together and what they would go someplace to do, we think about the following:\n\n- A place to sleep: they might go to a bed and breakfast (B&B), to a friend's house, a hotel, motel, dorm room, etc...\n- A place to dine: they might go to an internet cafe to get a snack or a coffee, a restaurant, a diner, to a friend's home or apartment/condo for dinner, etc...\n- Activities: they might go see a movie, a wedding, a friend's kid's recital, a concert, a festival, etc...\n\nIf you review these activities on the fly, you'll see that there are quite a few more \"they might go somewhere for\" activities than \"they might go somewhere with,\" which is why the question narrowed it down to the first option as the correct one.\n\nNow, consider that they were \"friends.\" Why would two friends want to see a wedding together, or spend time in an internet cafe? That doesn't sound like people that are friends.\n\nWell, they might spend time together at the movie theatre (this would be a place to do something), especially if one of them pays for the tickets (this would be \"doing something for someone else\"). But this also doesn't sound like \"doing something for each other\"...\n\nSo, only two possibilities seem to remain.\n\n- They went somewhere for something.\n- They went somewhere together.\n\nAs we've eliminated that they went to see something, there's really only one reasonable explanation left: it is possible, it is reasonable", "answer": "D: movie"}

{"text": "B\n\n### Rationale:Although the apple tree is from nearby, it will be an imported product. The question asks us to determine whether a product will be a United States export, so the implication is that the imported product is not American-grown or produced. Alaska is a United States region, but it is often considered far away from the east coast where most imports would come from, so that cannot be the answer. Canada is an obvious choice, as it is the closest country to the United States, but we can consider the context of the question given the following clues:\n    - The question refers to an apple tree that is nearby. It uses \"nearby\" to differentiate the apple tree from another source of apples that is far away. The \"nearby\" adjective is telling us that though the apple tree may be far away from Washington state, it is not that far away from the United States, so it is not \"far away\" like Canada, which could also be considered an \"import.\"\n    - The question ends with \"flowers,\" which is a very ambiguous, broad adjective. It could be referring to many things, but the context of the question still implies that the product is meant to be a particular food or plant, not a decoration.\nThese clues help us determine the correct answer; as Canada would be considered a nearby country by Washington state standards, it would be considered a \"far away\" country by apple tree standards.

What does the word \"what\" in this sentence refer to? Choices: \nA: days B: on your own C: want D: go out E: you\n\n### Response:\"\"She thinks that the best day are the days when you go out on your own to do what you want.\"\n\nWe can interpret the sentence as this: \"...that have a lot of freedom, where you get to do what you want to do without being interrupted or told what to do.\" \n\nThe last part of what she wants to do is \"you want to do.\" If it was \"I want to do,\" we'd say that \"she/they\" refers to her. Otherwise it refers to someone we can assume is a person. That is why it is correct to answer \"they.\"\n\n### Input:-\"I'm getting a dog\",Sarah stated.

They are often asked by hiring managers to evaluate if candidates will perform well in this sort of scenario given this sort of information.\n* If we imagine a scenario where it is true \"there is no land nearby,\" then the only reasonable thing the subject would do to lose weight or stay fit is to exercise, since they cannot work out or rock climb at home. Thus, the correct statement is that \"how can you get in shape at all if there is no land near the subject?\" the subject cannot get in shape at all, only exercise, and the correct answer, then, would be D: workout or E: both.\n\n### Answer\n*A: swim, B: jog, C: exercises, D: workout, E: Rock climb\n\n#### Explanation\n\n```text\nI tried something simpler first, but that wasn't accepted.

Further, this person is fantasizing about what they would get if they got a new driving job. This is important because it gives us ideas and clues about what we should put as the answer. The second sentence is more difficult, so I had to break it down: \"extra responsibilities...and the pros and cons of (something)\". Responsibilities and benefits both refer to something that you can get, which is important: they aren't talking about what you got, but what you might get.\n```\n\nThe first sentence narrows our possibilities down a lot. The person is fantasizing, and the question asks us what they're fantasizing about. \"new car, or promotion\" is the clear answer here. It doesn't make sense for a person to fantasize about getting a new car, because they don't need one.

However, poor people also could be intelligent so the author would consider them to be of little or no importance (intelligence is the most important to the author).\n  - We could also argue that D is correct because \"rich\" people are less intelligent.

Mild, moderate and severe describe the level of a effect of something, but on which factor?\n\nIt would be highly unlikely for that kind of treatment to have both average and severe effects, so we need to rule these out. In the context and structure of the sentence, Mild would be an unacceptable answer. Severe is out due to the lack of specificity (\"Dramatic effect of the treatment?\"). This leaves us with Moderate or Average. However, \"Average\" is clearly wrong, since it's \"average\" effect should not change to the \"moderate\" and \"severe\" ones after the treatment, and the average effect needs to be \"Average\" still after the treatment.

{"text": "Answer:\nE: funny\n\nAnswer Explanation: When the subject made contact with the exposed wire, it is reasonable to expect or predict that he or she would be shocked or startled. What you can't predict, however, is how the subject would react or respond to the situation. Given that the subject experienced shock or startled, the statement \"found it surprising that\" indicates that the subject had a different, more unexpected reaction.\nWith regard to the question \"Was he funny?,\" the subject did, in fact, not react \"normally,\" given the situation in which he could have reasonably expected to receive some form of adverse effect. Thus, the question can be interpreted to mean that the subject was funny, in this specific situation, with regard to \"finding that...\" he should not be \"surprised,\" as defined by the answer choices. Hence, one would expect humor to arise from the context described above and the fact that the subject was found to be \"funny\" indicates that they experienced an unusual reaction due to the shock or startled caused by the electric shock.\n\n### Discussion:\nDiscussion about this response is available.", "answer": "B: shocked"}
{"text": "Choice C: emergency room. Based on the context, this answer option is logically the best. The question does not specify exactly where the contraceptive would be obtained, and it refers to a singular contraceptive (contraceptive, not contraceptives). As such, it might not necessarily be in a drawer or cabinet. Moreover, the word \"one\" refers to exactly one contraceptive, so this contraceptive cannot be in more than one place at once. The contraceptive must then be in an emergency room, as this would be somewhere that could offer the service. Additionally, emergency rooms are often referred to and identified by the location of a body part, so if you need a contraceptive, you can find it in an emergency room. Thus, C would be the best answer option.\n\n### Acknowlegmements\n- Thanks to [Ruth Ito](https://www.freecodecamp.com/ruthita/) for their contribution to this answer.", "answer": "A: health center"}

{"text": "I believe the correct answer to this multiple choice question would be A, because this information was the least relevant to the overall premise of the movie. In the opening, the man is driving with care and patience, yet every time a car approaches the same car, he panics and gets into an accident. This suggests that his fragility is not so important to the plotline, because the plotline implies that he needs a partner. The idea of this movie is that if he can find a balance of care and patience, while still maintaining the ability to be frantic and impatient, then they can save each other, as these traits are usually countered, but can also work together, to prevent accidents. This hints at the ending when both people are driving recklessly, but are able to coexist, and thus prevent accidents. This shows they have learned their lesson, as both of their lives were almost ruined by their opposing traits.\nThis suggests the plot of a movie called \"Cinderella\". In Cinderella, Cinderella is forced to stay inside and clean while her stepmother and stepsisters enjoy their youth. Cinderella is very fragile, and she is also extremely polite and has a lot of patience. Yet, she is also very frantic, and wants to leave the house and enjoy her life. While the stepmother and steps sisters want to live their lives happily, yet end up destroying their clothes or their homes. Cinderella ends up saving her home when the stepsisters destroy it, and even makes the Prince realize his mistake of thinking she was simply a mean girl. This suggests Cinderella could be an opposing character to the man in this context, because she has his exact opposite traits. Thus I would choose answer A.", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}

The text states \"I want to do something with the dictionary to fix my problem with boredom.\" Hence, the possible solutions the author might consider would probably be related to activities for which a dictionary is a source of information.\n2. The answers that include the word \"dictionary\" are choices B, D, F.\n3.

{"text": "The question asks what happens to the conscience of the person who has been caught commuting a murder. We see that they were caught committing a murder, however we do not know if they were sentenced to jail or not. If we were given more information, as you suggested, we could form a more accurate conclusion.\n\n### Rationale:\nLet's start with the subject at hand, the person who has committed a murder. The subject is clearly someone who was caught committing the act, suggesting that they were likely punished for this crime. We then ask what exactly happens to one's conscience after being imprisoned for such a serious crime.\n\nHowever, the question itself is phrased incorrectly. To help us form a more accurate answer, let us consider the context, or lack thereof, provided in the question. While the question mentions that the person was caught for this crime, it does not tell us what happened to them. In other words, one could assume that the subject was charged and sentenced to jail time, or one could assume that the person was not charged, which could be a result of a lack of witnesses or evidence, or it could be an outright pardon.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the only two possible answers that could actually make sense are either A or C, as the subject could receive prison time, which would then damage his \"conscience,\" or they could receive no penalty at all and feel completely \"unreproachable\" or free from guilt.\n\nNow that we've established the context and clues of the question, then we can better analyze the choices.

In this case, a sword closet would seem like the only relevant answer, since the description of the scenario implies a man looking for a weapon by himself.

It would most likely be a car they own themselves and I would assume they are not renting the car from an agency or a company.\n\n\n### Rationale:\nThe sentence above tells us that the person is asking the owner if they are the owner of a 1993 car and if they are not, then who it actually belongs to. The subject is a singular pronoun but used in place of the plural pronoun, it is unclear whether the subject refers to the owner of the car or to the car itself. Audi, BMW and so on are companies and they do not make cars but produce them and are not really the owner of the cars they produce, but rather the manufacturers of them. Similarly, a bank does not really \"own\" the cars it holds as collateral, which leads to answer choices B and C being improbable and incorrect. Lexus and Toyota do make cars and these answers are even more unlikely since the question is not whether the subject owns a _part_ of the car, if they had asked if you are the owner of a Toyota you could have reasonably answered \"no, I am not the owner of the car, it belongs to me.\"\n\nAnswer", "answer": "A: florida"}

The word \"change\" is an adjective that modifies the noun \"newness,\" implying that the newness would be associated with an opportunity for change. The answer should not be D: \"experience,\" as it is not synonymous or associated in any way with \"new things\" and would instead be expected to be listed as a result of experiencing these new things.\n3. The phrase \"thank god\" connotes a strong belief in something, which is not necessarily aligned with exploring new opportunities. The choice \"pay bills\" seems slightly inconsistent as a choice for why people look for new things in life, which is not necessarily a negative statement but would rather be a positive reason to seek new things.\n\n### Answer:A  - The correct answer is A: \"become depressed\" because the rest of the choices are more logical matches for the rest of the sentence in the context of the problem.\nAnswer: A  -\n\n### Input:\"There are lots of people who like a particular TV show. The show is a funny and exciting mystery that takes place in the 70's.\" How do they feel about the show? Choices:  a: positive b: indifferent c: negative d: confused e: upset\n\n### Input to response:\n\n### Rationale:\nThe statement suggests that the writer is expressing general feelings about a TV show, which points towards the answer being something related to its overall appeal and appeal to the masses. The rest of the sentence further narrows down the options to either a positive or negative feeling about the show, or confusion about its overall appeal.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n### Answer choice A, for the most part, is the only option that provides a completely positive sentiment, that is, a \"happiness\" or \"pleasure.\" While it is true that we can derive a similar positive sentiment from the sentence", "answer": "B: welcome change"}

{"text": "### - What did the container have?\nA: A dollar\n### - What was the large container used for?\nA: a candy machine\n### - Who was there near to the container?\nA: My Grandma and Grandpa\n### Demonstation:\nThe word \"row\" is very telling - not only can we deduce that whatever this container was, it had to be used for many of them, but also that this is something relatively common and therefore probably not something related to cars or food. While the next sentence has much more to do with cars than we originally thought, we still conclude that this container was related to machines since it refers to it as \"a giant what\" and not a dime what. Furthermore, the question then references \"my Grandma and Grandpa\" to tell us this is a family store where machines and machines products are sold, narrowing it down even further. From the context it is clear that this container is definitely used for a machine, and one that is quite large.\nTaking into account this information, the correct answer must be \"warehouse\", as it has to do with a warehouse, which is also the next choice down and would otherwise look very out of place.\nAnswer: D: Warehouse\n\n## Answer:\nThe containers had 400 dollar.", "answer": "E: warehouse"}

{"text": "1. 1. The phrase \"box of clothes\" clearly suggests that clothes were being stored in the box. Therefore, the likely location is \"in the closet.\"\n2. 2. \"Trash\" and \"old\" suggest the box contained items that may be considered worthless or no longer used. This narrows the possibilities even more to \"trash\" or \"closet.\"\n3. 3. \"Holiday decorations\" further narrows the possibilities. We know that holiday decorations are stored in December, usually in a closet or attic. This eliminates options A, B, and C that refer to locations that are typically non-clothing storage spaces.\n4. 4. The last phrase \"didn't use\" may be referring to the closet in question being full of out-of-season clothes. This narrows the possibility to closet or attic, and the closet is a more likely option, since the decorations wouldn't be expected in an attic.\nIn conclusion, the most likely answer must be \"closet.\" Thus, the correct answer is D: closet\n\n5. The only possibility that is not a part of the given context is E. The attic, if this item were in it, would be considered an unorganized space, likely filled to the brim with unused and out-of-season items of all kinds, and a last resort for storage. The attic would be a storage space for holiday decorations, at most (assuming there were no seasonal furniture in it, and the owner had been living in that house for years). This would not be considered a \"box with unneeded items,\" since such a place would not count as a \"box of stuff.\" If the attic was used as a storage space for decorations, it would be expected that an attic with many out-of-season decorations would be a messy place, with large items everywhere, and such a messy attic does not fit the given context. If the attic was not the place to get these items from, \"loft\" could be used to refer to it, and such is not the context provided as well.\n\n### Input:: He needed to get some items from \"the attic\" which was \"stuffed with\" what?

So, the best kind of movie is one that lends itself to this behavior\n\n### Insturctions The first sentence contains a figure of speech called synecdoche in which part is substituted for the whole or whole is substituted for part. The sentence uses the word \"voice\" that clearly is not in the original music and refers to humans instead. \n\n### Input E: Where there's smoke theres fire.\n\n### Responses F: He's a voice for all ages.\n\n### G: The best kind of dog is the kind you can sneeze at.\n\n## # The third example, uses the idiom \"where there's smoke\" a figure of speech that substitutes for for \"where there's fire.\" Idioms and figures of speech is another very interesting topic, however it is important to remember that they are not standard grammar.

{"text": "### Input 1: When do you want the interview? I will be free on Monday morning.(What is the time?) Choices: A: I am going to the market at 8.00am B: Is it 8.30 or 8.40? C: What about Tuesday afternoon? D: Could you email me with the time and date? How to solve it: The time can be inferred from the question. The speaker uses simple past tenses, the time frame has already passed. For instance If he is now free to meet, he should be free some days ago before Monday. That means the interview date should be before Monday, and Monday is for sure a day after today, so we should assume the interview is on Friday.\n\n### Input two: What is the matter? (Could you tell me now?) Choices: A: This week is your birthday. B: Could you please talk in a normal, louder voice? C: It's cold in here today. D: I don't know where my keys are. How to solve it: There is only one person in the room and the speaker, she is complaining that something not well which the other person should know. Therefore the other persons should already know the matter. The only matter here is the weather. The person may be deaf and can't hear well, so she talks louder.\n\n### Analysis: When is my birthday?  If someone said this to you, if I'm your friend and if I'm you friend, I would probably tell you the date (or tell you a guess) If I did get the date wrong, and someone was annoyed that I guessed wrong, I would ask How could you get the date wrong? When are you birthday? So this question is to guess a date (you're asking about his birthday) This question does not ask for information at this stage. You should say: I don't remember... and then the person could have said it's this week (it's on Thursday, it is Friday, it is last Friday, it is Saturday) which would be fine or you could guess What do you mean it's this week? when you guessed right (you've guessed a single day, not a week).

We know that rubber balls, no matter what shape they are, always return to their state of rest. And because the clues says are at rest so he can sleep, they are at rest.\n2. The question asks what state it would be in. So it means if these rubber balls are at rest, this rubber ball would not be wakeful, restful or remain inactive. Therefore in motion is correct. \n3.

It's because taking a show may help a runner recover quicker as it refreshes him or her but restlessness or tiredness occur as part of the activity.\n3.As for taking a shower itself, options  (d) leg cramps and (e) sweating are the logical consequences of taking a show because they occur after a shower and because both of them happen after taking a shower.

Choices: A: city B: stripmall C: clerk  D: neighbor E:rooster\nRationales:\n1. The word \"could\" suggests the possibility of there being a \"could\" there be.\n2. The word \"there\" suggests a place and could be related to an area where beauty salons/barbershops.\n3. The phrase \"in a beauty salon\", narrows the range of potential answers to something related to hairstyles.\n4. The fact that the given choices include A \"city\" suggests that a city may be a potential answer.\n5. Similarly, B \"strip mall\" narrows the range of possible answers even further because strip malls are more likely to be found in suburban/rural areas than in cities and urban centers. Strip malls are known for being anchored with businesses such as shopping areas, hair salons, etc, and \"strip mall\" is an industry term for such a shopping area. Hence it could be a hairstyle business located in a strip style shopping center.\n6. There are other options that might narrow the possibilities further, such as shopping areas and other such businesses, however it seems unlikely that the \"could\" in the question refers to such a business.\n7. Finally, the option D \"neighbor hood\" does not seem to fit with the question, as it is unlikely that a beauty salon would be found in a neighborhood.\n\nHence the correct answer is A: cities\n\n### Demstration Explanation :\nInput:What could be at a beauty salon?

{"text": "The question is requesting information about _________, as indicated by the phrase ________ beverages. __________________ sugary beverage?\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question requests the context-related information of the given term, as the answer choices are the ones common to the given term. The only hint we are given is the phrase, \"sugary beverage,\" the term we are seeking information about. What this hints at is anything that could be the name of or related to water, based on its being called a \"beverage.\" The logical conclusion based on this is that it is a dessert, i.e., something that a person consumes after eating a meal, and that it is likely to be sweet. This makes _sugary_ and _beverage_ the primary features of the sought-after category. One of the terms that can meet these criteria is _coffee cup_ (related to water and coffee, a very common beverage worldwide), but not _mountain dew_ or _whirlpool bath_, the other examples given, which are _not_ related to water.

{"text": "As the question said, it\u2019s about \u201cgrape\u201d and it refers to \"What does one chop?\u201d In this situation, the best answer for me is A: \u201cfruit\u201d. After I answered the question, I found some different ways for others:\n\nThe question says 'one chop us a graap for?' You probably see the spelling mistake -- it's not \"one chop us a grab for,\" so we know that it's either A: fresh fruit or B: fruit cocktail. The latter makes more sense, because \"one chop us\" would be followed by an object (like \"a graap\"), and a \"fruit cocktail\" is more apt to be mixed than separated.\n\nThe correct answer is \"A: fresh fruit\". Now, to answer this, we have to eliminate the others. First we eliminate E because it is the last of the answers, and we always try to answer the question at hand first. Since E is the last, it is the least likely. Next, the question states that one is choping a grape, so it wouldn't be an answer. From there, the choices are A and B.\n\nI think B is the most probable choice.\n\n### Sample Answer:\nAnswer: A: fresh fruit\n\n### Input : How might having a pear tree in your backyard help you stay positive?

{"text": "*The word \"opera\" might not match the wording of the question (where they specified \"theater\"), but it is acceptable because the definition includes the word \"theater.\" \n\n### Demostration:\n1. \"Many\" suggests we are talking about numbers that are plural rather than singular, which would make \"populated area\" less likely because this implies a single place or building.\n2. \"Military base\" is another possible choice, but military bases often involve different types of performances, so the question more specifically asks for places that are known for \"theater.\" As such, it is unlikely that a military base would suffice.\n3. Schools, on the other hand, almost always have theater departments, so they would be a logical answer choice. (Just as churches would almost always be locations that hold performances). The word \"school\" might not match the question since they ask for the location of many theaters, but \"school\" includes \"university\" or \"college,\" which do contain theater departments. Hence, this would be a logical answer, making it the correct answer. \n\n### Answer: A: school", "answer": "B: populated area"}

The steps are followed by an answer that is in the correct format of a question. Then there are several test items that are designed to test the reasoning process used to complete the task. This explains why this task is designed to help diagnose an individual's reasoning abilities, as well as why someone's ability to complete this type of task properly will be a good indicator of their reasoning potential.\n2. **Input/Output**: The task asks a student to identify the object in a given scenario. The student is then asked to respond with their answer in written format. This is typical of a multiple choice reasoning task, in which the student is asked to choose a response based on the clues provided in the instructions. The instructions also use the typical format of a question, so the student knows to answer with their response.\n3. **Rationale**: 1. Similar to the instructions above, the instructions provide a clear explanation of the task in which this question is answered. The instructions also provide a step-by-step analysis of the key clue information. 2. After these instructions are completed, the student is asked to respond by answering in a given format.\n4. **Context**: In this instruction, we have the same format of a test question: asking a student to respond to a multiple-choice question about a scenario that is written in given form. \n5. **Output:** We can see that in this task, the answer is in the correct format as the answer to a question would be.

After several days, the bank sent him the following statements about his account: A: I am grateful for your business with us. B: You still owe us $5.00. C: Your account has been charged 10.00. D: Your account is very healthy. E: Your account balance is very low.\n\n### Rationales :\n1. First of all, this problem is asking us to find \u201cA\u201d. So, if we take your first sentence and eliminate all the possible answers, we see that A, B, D, and E are not correct because they don\u2019t contain \u201cyou still owe us $0.00. So, we are left with C and F. From what we know from our statements, all the other answers are incorrect because they don\u2019t have \u201cyou still owe me $5.00\u201d. A) The statement will either say \u201cI am grateful for your business\u201d or \u201cYou still owe us 0.00\u201d. (We know that it is not B, D, E, or F). Now, to answer this question, we will have to look at the words that follow both C and F, to see if we can eliminate some of the answers. The phrase that follows the statement \u201cYour account is very healthy\u201d is \u201cYour account balance is very healthy\u201d. And, the phrase that follows \u201cYour account is very low\u201d is \u201cYour account has been charged $10.00 from a previous error\u201d. Now that we know what the statement following C and F are, we can either eliminate or identify the other answer. The other answer is \u201cYour account balance has been charged $1.00\u201d. (This is because both C and F contained the word \u201cYour account has been\u201d and, since \u201cYour account balance\u201d is used in this other line, we know that the other line is a variant of the first answer and therefore, we need to look at the end of the sentences, if the sentence reads the same except for the last 3-4 words, it is", "answer": "A: come home"}

Underground could also be unappealing due to the claustrophobic effect of such passageways and if marmosets can't fly, they do not typically travel underground.

In the same vein, if relaxation happened more frequently, it is reasonable to assume that this would improve the subject's musical performance.\n3. The only response that we cannot directly link to the subject's practice is \"noise,\" which seems to suggest that the subject is performing poorly.\n4. We can eliminate most of these options on the basis of the context provided, that the subject is good at violin. We now have the options \"relaxation\" and \"noise\" as potential answers.\n5. A good option would be \"relaxation,\" as the subject may start to feel like practicing violin more. This would lead to the subject becoming less tense and feeling more comfortable throughout practice and eventually the noise that the subject may create would be less.\n\nAnswer: 1. A: Sad\n2. B: create music\n\n## Sample 4\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following questions.\n\n### Input :What would happen to the man if he stopped being able to read books?

{"text": "In this problem, we are told that we will hear harpsichords ____. We are to fill in the blank with one of five possible options: make noise, band, museum, concert hall, or rubber band.\n\n### Justification:\nTo understand where we will hear a harpsichords, we must first understand what a harpsichord is. A harpsichord is a musical instrument with a keyboard and a set of strings that makes the instrument play when the keyboard is being struck. Because there are many types of musicians, harpsichords are unlikely to be heard in the same place as other musical instruments. We are thus left with three options for where to hear a harpsychords: make noise, concert hall, and museum. In a concert hall, a harpsichord would likely be played by a musician, so we can eliminate that option. In a museum, we could certainly hear a harpsichoid, but we are unlikely to hear a band there because of its noisier nature. Finally, in order to make a noise, a harpsichords has to be struck or played. When we are told that we \"will hear\" a harpsichords in this problem, therefore, we know that we will hear it in a place that would allow it to be played. Since harpsichords are only found at concert halls, we know that we can hear them ____ there. Based on this logic, we can eliminate A and D and are thus left with choices B and E. Since the correct answer is also a choice given, we can eliminate C, and based on the given clues, the only relevant possibility left is ____ band. Therefore, the correct answer is \"band.\"\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Challenge:\nAnswer the following in 100 words.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTell how you came up with the correct solutions.

{"text": "1. Rationale 1:\n- We have read that she wants to exercise to lose weight. Now we want to understand why she wants to lose weight and we have some clues to help us find the answer.\n- Since the sentence starts with \"I want to\", it directly follows the speaker and is likely a purpose.\n- She wants to exercise to \"lose(n) weight\". Therefore, her purpose could be: \"lose(n) the number of pounds\" so \"lose (more) weight\".\n- What could be causing her to lose weight? Is it her daily routine? Is it something she can't control?\n\n2. Rationale 2:\n- Muscle weakness fits into the criteria.\n\n3. Rationale 3:\n- Muscle strength is something we have control over and we can't control the daily routine (her mom wants her to exercise 4+ times a week).\n\n4. Rationale 4:\n- Losing weight is something we have control. Tiredness is due to overtraining and is not something to exercise.\n\n### Output: A: lose (more) weight B: to gain (more) fitness C: to lose (more) muscle mass D: to improve (more) muscle tissue E: to be thinner\n\n### Output Explained:\n- \"lose weight\" was the only purpose she gave in her problem.\n- There are only 3 options. \"gain fitness\" doesn't mean she wants to gain weight but she wants to gain strength in muscles because weight would be the result.\n- Increase in muscle mass is also not there. \"gain muscle tissue\" is also not there.\n- The last one was the answer we deduced from Rational 3.\n\n### Rationale 1: There were clues at the beginning of the question \"Why would I want to exercise\" so we deduced purpose.\n\n### The problem asked what the subject is looking for in their answer, if I want exercise I may want to lose weight, gain fitness, lose muscle mass, increase muscle tissue, and be thinner.\nWhatever answer I want I may have some sort of motivation for that result since a result means that effort came through.\n\n### I wanted to lose weight because I do not want more", "answer": "E: losing weight"}

{"text": "The government helps **parents** with schooling **through the provision of resources such as teacher's wages, textbooks, and school supplies**, with the expectation that the families will make regular use of these resources **by paying their children's tuition**.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe question asks us to describe who the government helps in schools. From the answer choices, the **only** person mentioned is a **parent**, which can be assumed to be a mother based on the context of the question. Furthermore, a parent providing schooling is described in the next clause of the paragraph, telling us that **children do not attend public schools**. This eliminates all but **parent** from the possible answer choices, making answer B the most likely option.\n\nNext, an entire sentence is dedicated to listing the forms of help a parent receives. These **include** the provision of resources, from **teachers' wages** to **textbooks** and **school supplies**. This suggests that these are all things a parent would receive help with, and that the government **does help parents** through such resources. We can confirm this interpretation by looking at the next sentence, which uses the pronoun **it**. This implies that a specific source of help is being referred to, that it is being provided to the parents through additional resources, and that it requires a payment or use of the resources.\n\nAnother sentence is dedicated to explaining how the parents' payment obligations are in service of this provision of extra help, by saying that the **money** they pay **towards tuition** is what allows the government to **invest in schools** further. These details tell us that the government provides educational aid **through the provision of financial investment** in public schools rather than through simply increasing wages, which the other resources are.\n\nThis answers the questions posed by the given information. The government does in fact provide aid to schools through the help of parents by providing financial assistance, but does not **allow parents** to **take** money or **get** money. Finally, we can conclude that the government does **take** money (through taxation) and **require** that it be paid back at the end of the year by the **parents** of the children enrolled in the program.\n\nAnswer: B: parent\n\n### Input : Write a response that appropriatly completes the request", "answer": "A: school children"}

Marketing activities often use images of customers interacting with the product, which gives you another clue, in the form of \"fans\".\n\n### Rationales:\nYou know that you are an account manager, so what are your accountabilities? The answer to this can only be sales or marketing activities.\n\nHence, the most logical answer is something related to sales and marketing, and you can go on to analyze the specific questions and find the most appropriate answer:\n\n1. What are the fans doing at the start of every show?\n            The fans will be cheering or clapping, but what are they doing?\n            You can come to the conclusion that there must be some kind of entertainment, otherwise why would people be clapping.\n\n2.

What does the band want to do at the beginning of each concert?\n            A: work hard\n            B: relax\n\nYou can come to the conclusion the show will begin with a bang because it involves loud noise - something the band does in silence - and the band is not going to want to do it by relaxing, so it must be working hard.\n\nYou can also look at the first question a little more closely:\n\n1. The band loved what at the start of each concert?\n\nA: hearing them go mad\n2. When the band gets on stage, they love for the crowd to [do] what at the start of the show?\n\nA: go mad\n3.

The leftovers were then covered in mold. This fits the description of a container such as a leftovers container: the container would have been forgotten and covered in mold due to its closing lid.\n\n2.

Choices:  Write A new question here\n\nRationales: Write Answers to this type of question.\n\n## Input:\nHow can we prevent illness and disease caused by poor oral health before it is too late?\n\n## Input-Response \n\nBe proactive instead of reactive with oral health. It is a lot easier to prevent the problem rather than trying to solve problems when they already exist. It is important to educate yourself regarding dental and medical professionals regarding any history of oral issues that you may have. Don't be afraid to ask for help, early intervention is key. Make sure to get dental checkups at least every six months and don't wait until it's an emergency to see your dentist.\n## Input-Response\n\nI know someone who had problems with the gums and went to the dentist for evaluation, and he was told that he needed regular cleaning, and also check ups every 4-6 months depending on a person's age. He was then diagnosed with diabetes and this showed him the importance of taking care of his teeth. Dentists told him that oral issues can lead to other medical issues. This person also wanted to quit smoking, and so he had a lot of motivation to quit smoking and work on better oral care.\n\n## Input-\n\nScience has shown that there is a correlation between poor oral health and cardiovascular disease. Good oral health is essential in reducing the risk factors for coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Studies also show a link between periodontal disease and increased risk for a variety of other diseases and conditions, including respiratory infections, pancreatic cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and pregnancy complications.

{"text": "#### Write the response that appropriately complements the request.\n-  The question makes it clear that the person is looking for these things; suggestions implies that we are supposed to give suggestions, not criticisms.\n- The answers are a little tricky to narrow down. The given prompt does not specify who is making the request, and there is no specific information to differentiate them.\n\n- Taking a closer look at what the answerer might be looking for, 2 types of foods seem to stand out: alcohol and fried. Alcohol and fried food, particularly beer and pizza (as suggested by your example from pubs), are quite common to find in bars and fraternity houses.\n\n- Bars and Fraternity houses are clearly the most likely context in which one would find these foods, and, since it is a request for suggestion, the answer will have to be a suggestion, not a criticism of the person.\n\n- The example from the pub makes it clear that the drinks and food found there are beer and fried foods respectively, and bars are commonly associated with alcohol.\n\n- Alcohol is associated with bars where liquor is sold and drunk, and pizza is a type of food which is widely associated with fraternity houses. Hence, the answer that best matches the prompt will be A: pub.\n\n- Rationale:\n\n- The only type of food that is associated with bars is pubs, so, a pub is the only choice that matches with the answer.\n\n- Along with this, pubs are where people go to drink (as we know from your example) and bars are where liquor is sold, so a pub will have both options since it sells liquor.\n- Furthermore, pubs are often associated with beer and, since they are the destination we want to reach, it makes sense to suggest this type of food.\n\n- While there are other types of food that are widely associated with frat houses, like pizza or burgers, the only type that is associated more closely with them is fried foods. This is a type of food that is generally bad for people and often found in the kitchen, which makes it easy for the answer to mention. \n\n- Moreover, since fraternity houses are usually a place to find food, I'd have to suggest that the options are found", "answer": "A: pub"}
{"text": "Let me first explain the meaning of the term grooming before a job. In general grooming refers to the process of preparing oneself to do something, especially something that is important. When preparing for a job interview grooming refers to preparations in terms of dress code. However, the way one does their hair, wears makeup, or puts on a tie is sometimes called grooming as well. As we can see from the question, it is referring to the latter sense.

{"text": "Input: Ben was an alcoholic\nRationales: The clue in here that we can use is `something` in the middle sentence. It is telling us that Ben has done some things and not all of these things were good, otherwise not alcoholic enough. This eliminates choices `A` and `D`.\nInput:because of his mistake,he spent 8 years somewhere\nRationales: `somewhere` in the sentence is a location we are looking for\nInput:Ben was in an accident and spent 8 years somewhere in the middle sentence\nRationales: This makes us sure that Ben made a mistake in an accident that took place in the middle of the sentence. Also, the sentence ends with the word `somewhere` which tells us that the location of Ben is not in the same sentence as the location that Ben was in previously.\nRationales: We know that Ben is an alcoholic and that he spent 8 years in somewhere and that something bad happened that he made a mistake in and also that something good happened that Ben was in prison. We know that somewhere is not where he started from. The only location that can go in between the other two is prison.\n\n### Input:\"If this is in California, it must be a movie,\" said the director.  Where was the film being made?

Also,the director said that if the movie was in California, it was a movie.This tells us that either the movie was not in California or that the movie was not there where was the director. The latter is more likely, as the sentence in-between is a clue that there must be a sentence in-between the two, as told to us by the director. The two clues are that the movie was in California and not there where the director was. This means that the movie was in Hollywood.\n\n###Instruction:The most helpful clues appear in the last three sentences.

{"text": "The prompt states that one way to indicate that somebody \"likes temperatures cool\" is to have more than one electric fanning. We can interpret this as an interest in cool temperatures, but we do not necessarily have to view electric fans here. That would be in some sense like interpreting a sentence \"I have many books\" to mean \"I like books.\" The key point is that given some evidence, it should be feasible to determine an action that is logically implied.\n\nWe will attempt the following inference: We know that somebody that likes cool temperatures is likely to have more than one fan; the location of electric fans does not really affect the room temperature. If somebody likes cool temperatures, are they likely to have an electric fan in more than one room in their house? We can assume so, since an extra room in the house will be heated or cooled to cool temperatures regardless of the location of the fan. Therefore, somebody that likes cooler temperatures is likely to like to have more fans. In the case of electric fans in multiple rooms in the house, this implies that \"More than one electric fan\" can be translated to \"Fan in home,\" and the answer is B: home.\n\nAnswer: B: home\n\n### Input:\"We could use your help\" is what?\" Choices:  A. statement B. question C. statement with a question mark D. a question E. a suggestion\n\n### Response\nThe prompt provides a conversation between two people (a and b) through which they are making a request. The key here is to understand what kinds of statements or requests can be made between two parties when they want another party (c) to help out. We can infer from the word \"help\" that c will have to do something to help out a and b.\n\nThe sentence \"We could use your help!\" can be interpreted as a statement or a question, depending on the audience. The grammatical structure indicates that it is a statement, but it is ambiguous whether it is asking for help or saying that help can be used. In the case of a statement, the request refers to a person requesting help, while in the case of a question, it refers to a person request to help, and the subject is the person making the request (a or b).\n \nThe following reasoning applies to the response:\n\nFrom the context, we understand that", "answer": "A: home"}
{"text": "You get an A? Wow, I guess you did pretty good then.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. It is implied that you did well on the earlier test, which you may or may not have been told. Whether or not you had prior access to your teacher's expectations for the test, you did do well and can use the word \"you\" throughout the sentence.\n2. \"Did pretty good\" is a way of saying that you are satisfied with your performance and do not need to specify what your grade is.\n3. \"Wow, I guess you\" expresses that you are surprised while also recognizing that it was the subject who passed the test.\n4. \"you did pretty good then\" is a positive acknowledgment and congratulations.\n5. \"then\" is a time expression indicating that you did well on that earlier test, hence the \"then\" indicates that the new test was just completed and the expectation is that a different grade will be given.\n\n### Input\nWhat would you like to be when you grow up?\n\n### Explanation\n\n![An image explaining what to put and why it's correct.](./image1.png)\n\n### Example:\n\nAnswer: An engineer?

It would be appropriate to call the child \"you\" throughout the entire conversation since the child is the speaker. In addition, the child has already spoken, leaving the speaker with the opportunity to respond.\n2.  \"you\" is the correct pronoun to use throughout the rest of the conversation.\n3.  At first the sentence is unclear, as it sounds like the child is in need to ask a lot of questions. However, it turns out the child was not interested in asking questions and rather wanted to relay information about how they would do well when they grow up.\n4.  \"I'm sure you'll be an engineer\" is a statement about the subject's future that is likely to be positive or at least neutral, and therefore a good response.\n5.", "answer": "D: school grade"}
{"text": "Your response was wrong for this task. The correct answer is C.\n\n### Explanation:\nThis question gives us some general information about the room, but it tells us nothing about the room itself. The question does not give any indication that the dining table belongs directly within the room with the room's specific function. The answer you chose is based on a literal interpretation of what the question is saying. The answer is simply D: formal/in the dining room, but it neglects what room the person is specifically asking where to put the table. This room is a formal dining room, so they do not want it in the formal dining room.\n\nThis is why the answer is C: in the park, outside.\n\nAnswer: C: in the park\n\n### Instructions:How do you put out flames? Choices:  I: pour water on them A: throw water around and fan it B: try to blow out the fire C: extinguish the flames D: douse it\n\n### Response is:\nYour response was incorrect for this task. The answer is A, try to blow out the flames.\n\n### Further Explanation:\nFirst, let us examine some of the hints given in the problem itself. The question says we are putting out flames, which to most people is a fire. In this case, we have a flame which is burning our dinner, thus there is a fire involved. Now, it specifically says to try to blow out fire. Since the question makes a distinction between putting out and blowing out fires, A is more likely to be correct, especially because of the hints given in this question.\n\nLet us examine the wording and flow of the question itself, to better understand the context. The question first gives us our task, which is to put out flames. This suggests that the subject is referring to a flame (or fire) and that we are in the act of putting it out. This makes sense because of previous hints given by the question. The subject then goes onto to distinguish between types of flame by referring to blowing out flames. This gives us very little information, except that a blowing flame will not be blown out. This implies that they are trying to blow out a fire. As mentioned before, the fact that the question is very explicit about blowing flames out further supports A", "answer": "E: house"}
{"text": "The correct answer is D: cooperation.\n\n### Input (draft):What is necessary for learning something by yourself? Choices (draft): A:patience B:study C:exposure D:cooperation E:thought\n\n### Rationale (draft):\n    - The correct answer is D:cooperation.\n    - The question tells us that we must do something by ourselves. There are several choices given:\n        - Patience refers to a passive role, one does not actively participate in this and so is not suitable for learning something.\n        - Exposure refers to gaining experience, though as such is not inherently beneficial for learning a new skill.\n        - Study refers to passive research, again, not directly related to the task of learning.\n        - Thought refers to an intellectual process, but does not relate directly to learning.\n    - By ruling out Patience, Study, Exposure and Thought, we are left with Cooperation as the only suitable choice.\n    - This rationale is the most concise and straightforward way to analyze the input without having to think extremely hard, so this is the best solution\n\n### Demostration:\nYou can do the following things:\n- [Read these articles ](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/2/21/18231398/best-ai-chatbots-conversational-ai-chabot-platform-cognitive-agents)\n- [Try out the chat bots.](https://botlist.co/interact/free)\n- Read the [past answers](https://github.com/sylium/Syllabus/blob/master/past-answers.md)\n- Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuzhou-wang-9a7ca519d/)\n- [Watch my progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCJ5hvpYFgk)\n\n### [Get a T-shirt](https://t.co/4nZqnTKZhW) about AI and Chatbot!", "answer": "C: study"}

He has to take the rest of week after the week after.\n\n### Rationale for Answering Question 4\nIn question 4, we learn that a manager who has been at a company for a while has to take the resting time and the manager is being considered as plural in the sentence. If we look at the sentence again, \"who is been here for a while\" is already plural. In this case, the answer we can give is \"who is been here a while\" or \"who have been here a while because the answer to A is inappropriate and B is grammatically wrong.\n\n### How to answer the question:\nThere are many ways through which the questions can be answered. We can write a question using intransitive structure, with a simple infinitive with to. However, in this situation towed is a prepositional phrase, and there is no noun. Towed, in other words, means to be hooked up behind another, heavier automobile and then pulled by it. In the context of this question, towed does not seem like an appropriate answer unless there's a specific word that means towed. So the correct answer is A.\n\n### Question 5:\nI was not sure if he was the one who [forged the document] Choices:  A) Forged.  B. Had Forged 2: C): forged [him] 3: D): has forgot 4: E): has forged\n\n### Answer:\nI think that the correct answer is \"E) Has Forged\" because, you know the verb of passive voice is used in the sentence. Also, it is the only one which fits the sentence grammatically.\nThe sentence says, \"I was not sure if the man who had forged the document was the one who forged the document.\" In this context, I should use a different structure to answer the question. We use \"Who or what ____\"", "answer": "E: ticket"}

This leads us to the conclusion that either \"keep alive\" or \"keeping alive\", which is essentially synonymous to \"staying alive\", is a possible answer.\n\nIf we compare the \"keep alive\" answer to \"need to\" answer, they are both grammatically correct and do fit the context, but it turns out \"keep alive\" actually makes the most sense. \"Need\" in this context would mean that there is a requirement for them to keep \"alive\". Without the negative context of \"do not\" in \"don't need\", the implication is that an animal _would_ need to keep \"alive\" no matter how tired or exhausted they are. On the other hand, \"keep alive\" means that the animal could be alive but in a passive manner without consciously maintaining their life. Thus, \"keep alive\" is the logical answer.\n\n### Answer to Demystified:\nAnswer: C\n\n### Instructions: Answers the following multiple choice question and provides a statement that uses the response you have identified as the correct answer.\n\n## Demonstration: \nThe sentence has three parts. A:The reason we must remember not to take a drink to bed is B: Because sleeping will make us 1) less sleepy and 2) more alert. C: We'll be more alert if we stay awake, and we'll be less alert if we sleep.\n \nAnswer: B: Because sleeping, though not impossible, will make us tired from using our energy and less sleepy and more alert.\n\n\n\nThe sentence has three clues. A: \"The reason we must remember\" indicates that there is a why we need not to take a drink. B: \"not to take a drink to sleep will make us less sleepy and more awake and alert\" is a hint that we should not take a drink to bed. C: \"Stay awake and we will be more alert\" indicates that if we take a drink to bed, there will be consequences. The clues are: A B C\n\nFrom clues A and C, the", "answer": "B: lie down"}

They did not have all the modern building materials that people use today.\n\n- That is why they used the attics for storage purposes.

Choices:  A. get promoted B. get praised C. get a raise  D: win an award E: get noticed\n\nRationales: The problem states that the subject, by showing the pronoun \"her\" is female. From the question, we can see that there are some hints that she is eager for recognition from her boss for whatever she did. \"Proud of\" means she is happy and confident about the work she has done.

Choices:  B: north T: timeline E: end F: new G: night\n\n### Response\n\nLooking at the abbreviation on a map, we see that the letters N and T are capitalized, while the letters E and R are in a different typeface, both of which are common in modern typography (Capitals for main terms, lowercase for qualifiers). This suggests that the abbreviation could be similar to terms like GEO, TURTLE, or REX, that have initial capitals and a lowercase abbreviation.

{"text": "### Demostration:\nInput: When would you be able to see your cousin in person? Choices: A: next month B: last month C: tomorrow D: last week E: 2 days before last week\nRationales: There are two parts to this question: an inference and a calculation.\n\n- The inference: We need to establish when your cousin's birthday is based on the information given in the problem: \"you can see your cousin 2 days before his birthday\". \"2 days before his birth\" means it is in the past. When is your cousin's birth? \"2 days before\" means it is not the actual day of the birthday, and \"before\" means you need to count backwards. This means your cousin's birth is on the day before \"2 days\". So to find out when is that birthday you need to subtract two days from the actual date. In the example question, the answer is January 25th.\n\n- The calculation: Given that the birthday of your cousin is on January 25th, and that \"you can see your cousion 2 days before his bithday\", \"today can be\" January 24th. The \"can be\" because of course the date changes every year, but we can always find a day around the same time every year as the birth day of our cousin.\n\nGiven that: January 25th\nIs today: January 23rd or 24rth\n\nAnswer: D.

Choices A: 10 seconds B: 20 seconds C: 30 seconds D: 40 seconds E: 50 seconds\nRationales: A, C, and E all involve multiple pieces, though not identical ones, so none of them can be the correct answer. Choice B is more complicated: a 10-second is a unit of time, and could potentially be carved out of one piece. However, it is clearly ambiguous whether seconds is referring to seconds of a longer time period (5 days, 1 years, etc.), or seconds as part of a \"normal\" second. Similarly, choice D is ambiguous as to whether it is a reference to a unit of time (hours, minutes, seconds) or a measurement (10 seconds long). Therefore, the correct answer is C: 30 second, which refers to only 30 seconds (the shortest amount of time we can count in seconds), and clearly cannot be \"carved out\" of one piece.\n\nComment: I was told to include all the instructions and responses in case there are any changes.", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

When walking becomes more trouble than it is worth, where else would he be walking to and from but his home?\n3. The only word that answers to that purpose is `home`, and it would not fit in with the rest of the sentence because it is a noun instead of a part of speech that the rest of the sentence is constructed around. Hence, the only noun that actually works at the moment of analysis is `garage`.\n4. We can deduce the following pieces of information that do not follow the pattern of that garage is probably the parking garage.\n    - The man does not have to commute by _garage_ anymore. \n    - The man still has to walk to and from _garage_ after commuting.\n5. We can now narrow down the possible choices, because we know that it cannot be a `drop-off area` or the `repair shop` (which is a noun but not an `area`). The only thing left is the `parking garage`.", "answer": "D: parking garage"}
{"text": "C: injury\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe only \"proper\" answer choices are:\n\n\"A: get hungry\"\n\nBecause we know we are playing a game so that means it can either be food or laughing. From here we know we are either laughing or getting hungry so the correct answer is getting hungry.\n\n\"B: laughter\" because we are playing games in the beginning of this paragraph but in the middle it shifts saying \"someone playing to much\". Thus, that means we are being serious and that means we are either serious or laughing. That only leaves serious because we are in the middle in the sentence. If we are being serious then we aren't laughing which is impossible so it's serious.\n\n\"C: injury\" because someone playing aggressively would likely cause injury.\n\n\"D: having fun\" because being physically active is fun so it is correct.\n\n\"E: feeling happy\" if it's physically active and you are doing it with another person it would make you happy.\n\nIn injury it says \"might cause\" if it were an injury it would have to go past more than a couple people for it to cause an injury because someone would have to do an illegal act.\n\nThus the only answer choices that are 100% correct in my opinion are:\n\n\"B: injury\"\n\n\"C: having fun\"\n\nAnswer: C: injury", "answer": "C: injury"}

{"text": "1. The question asks us to describe the subject's action, and the clues given in it suggest that whatever we choose would also suggest a corresponding reaction on the part of the enemy they were fighting. The question thus puts a great deal of contextual weight on our answer and is therefore heavily dependent on the choices available.\n2. \"Abandon\" would signal the opposite action, and suggest a correspondingly different reaction from the enemy, which would make A and D incorrect (and I consider both of them to be wrong anyway since Bill is unlikely to smile or smile to an enemy).\n2. \"Arrogate\" or \"Retain\" have the correct tone of action and reaction but do not fit the context; they imply a taking of ownership of something, and would suggest an enemy's either surprise or grudging agreement, which does not seem reasonable given the use of \"fight\" and \"fighting\" in the question.\n4. \"Embrace\" also makes more sense than some of the choices; this makes us think of holding the enemy, and the enemy being taken by surprise; however, this is a relatively weak action in the context of the wording in the question.\n5.

{"text": "The answer is A: cook dinner. There is a problem of a lack of food at home that means they cannot eat there. There is something they can do to the dinner situation. There is some effort that will be required. The answer is something that can be applied to the dinner situation - 'cook': \"They wanted to eat at [dinner location], but the cupboards were [something about that location] so they had to go [to another place].\"\n\n### Rationale\n\nWe know they need to eat at home, because they can't eat at work. The answer is a noun which could help them with the meal, either by cooking for it, or in preparation for the meal, or in having an alternative to the meal.\n\nThe choice 'cook dinner' fits because there is a lack of food in the cupboards. The only thing to cook at home is dinner. We know they wanted to eat at home and must make some food because we're told 'cupboards were barren' and we know there isn't any food if there is nothing to cook what is 'dinner' the subject was talking about.\n\n### Choices\n\n* The word 'go' (to the supermarket) is a verb - it does not describe the food in a literal way (like the way 'cook' does).\n* The word 'back' is being used differently that we would think. 'back' means to return to a place to go back to the beginning. To return to work or to go back to the start (where they started from). They are not returning to where they started from to eat a meal, they should just cook. This means the word 'back' is not an option here.\n* A person does not need to make food when going on a first date or the first day at a restaurant.\n\n### Response\n\nInput: He left the restaurant thinking, \"Would I do this again?\" and what conclusion did he come to?

Grammatically speaking, not all words are made equal, either. \n\n### In the sentence, \"My friend is very good at playing the piano,\" what is the part of speech of the word \"friend\"?\nA noun,", "answer": "A: utah"}

It does not provide any indication that the subject should be asked a question or give any information related to their thoughts. The possible answers are:\n\n### \"I am looking at the clock because it is 7:55PM, and I need to leave home in twenty minutes.\"\n### \"I don't know.

{"text": "Reckless driving leads to numerous and diverse possible outcomes, depending on how extreme the driving is. \"Reckless driving,\" as the question states, is defined as \"driving in a manner that indicates a conscious and willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.\"\n\nThe possible outcomes of reckless driving can be roughly broken down into two groups: 1. Those that cause tangible harm to the individual driving or others and 2. Those that cause harm only to the driver or create minor inconveniences.\n\nTangible outcomes can include injuries or fatalities, either to the driver themselves such as in a car crash, or as a third party affected by the reckless driving, such as by falling debris while driving down rain-soaked pavement. Traffic jams and other accidents that result from reckless driving, however, are not direct causes for injuries or fatalities; these are more likely the result of reckless driving, not a direct cause.\n\n\"Tire treads can cause accidents by losing some of their tread depth,\" according to [What You Need to Know About Tires and Tread Depth](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/tips/what-you-need-to-know-about-tires-and-tread-depth). Tire treads are directly involved in driving and are impacted by improper or reckless driving, so this is classified as a tangible outcome.\n\nThe phrase, \"tired E: accidents\" also gives some potential outcomes. \n\n\"Being tired while driving increases the risk of an accident,\" according to [The Effects of Being Tired While Driving](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/08/the-effects-of-being-tired_n_559726.html). This also provides a tangible result, but its indirect nature means it is not as likely as a direct result. There is no clear relationship between \"tired\" and \"accidents;\" the association of each one can be made based on being an abstract concept. So, this cannot be the true outcome.\n    - \"Reckless driving [...] leads to fatigue and can [be] indirectly related to accidents", "answer": "A: injuries"}
{"text": "The correct choice for the \"Input question\" would be A. In the \"Input\" portion of the question we are referring to an attempt to confirm applicant's reference that would fail if the reference did what? This question is asking what would cause an applicant's potential employer to fail to get in contact with their previous employer. The other choices suggest different ways that an employer might actually contact a previous employer, so they are incorrect.\nThere are two main things which an employer can contact their previous employer about for a previous employee they interviewed who would fail them to get in contact.\n\n**The first choice**\n> An employee's job can be terminated for a variety of reasons, including poor performance. In this case, the employer refuses to give employment reference to a sub-par employee as he believes that his company would not like him to vouch for that employee again in the future.\n\n**The second choice**\n> The other reason can be if the previous employer had found out that the new job applicant doesn't disclose his whole working experience during a job interview. He was, say, fired for misbehavior and the new company is inquiring about the details of the employee's termination with the previous company.

{"text": "John is getting something important, what does this make him feel. This answer can be A: then have B : headaches C: stoical D: being happy E : wanting more. the answer is C: stoical.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn which \"then\" \"headaches\"  \"stoical\" \"being happy\" and \"wanting more\" are the answers. The first step in problem analysis is to carefully read the entire problem, not just the question. The first line of the problem tells us that John is getting something important. We can use the process of elimination to determine that the answer cannot be A: Headaches, because headaches do not suggest anything to do with obtaining or receiving something. This is an easy case of elimination -- looking at the options and ruling out things that don't make sense.\n\nSecondly, the phrase \"stoic is a very strong clue for choosing the answer. A stoic is a person who does not allow their mood or attitude to be easily influenced by things happening around them. When thinking about John getting something important, a reasonable question to think about is what will he be feeling, based on the fact that he is getting something important.\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question. \n\n###Explanation:\nI am a high school student and I love my friends and I like my teachers and I love playing soccer and I dream about travelling.

{"text": "In a competitive sport, such as basketball, spectators are interested in seeing one winner.\n\n### Rationales: 1) The teams were evenly matched. Which tells us that they are evenly competitive, which in this situation is good for fans. Fans want to see the best match up.\n2) In terms of what we are asking, the question asks \"what spectators wanted.\" There isn't a definite answer, however, most of the time the result of a basketball game is that there is one winner.\n3) Most spectators want to see one team be defeated, so by being evenly matched, we are increasing the chances of one team being defeated over the other. Thus, we will see one winner.\n\nRationale 3 is incorrect. Spectators are not necessarily interested in who wins, as a number of fans may dislike either team, but rather the quality of the teams. A match where the better team wins is more satisfying for fans compared to a match where the underdog team won, even if it was by one point.\nSpectators of any sport are interested in watching a team win.\n\n### Task\nInput:In the beginning of the new contract, the player would get to earn $190,000 per year.

So, the conclusion that `is not` applies to something (an entity) and following that is a `what` that can be a headgear (a hat).

{"text": "Input: A person is likely to find a large village in what area? Choices: A: rural area B rural area C: suburbs answer: D rural area\n\n### Explanation: \n\n### Hint:\n\n#### Rural Areas\nare areas not usually associated with a city or town. For example, rural areas have a rural lifestyle and are filled with different kinds of homes - houses, trailers, and cabins - and there are usually a lot of animals roaming around. Additionally, you will find more dirt roads in the rural areas.\n\n### Hints for the following questions:\n1. 5 people are riding in a car and there are two dogs in the back. If I go in the front, then two people sit in the back. If no one goes in the back, two people go in the front. How many people can ride in this car?\n2. Find out what all of the following animals (and their sounds) have in common: pig - oink, cow - moo, duck - quack, tiger - roar, cat - meow, turtle - hum?\n3. There are 5 cups, each with a different colored liquid in them. The colors are brown, blue, red, yellow and green. How many different pairs of matching colors do you see?\n#### Answer:\n1. If 2 people go in the back, that leaves 3 seats in the front. But 1 person is riding with the pig in the front and 5 people in the back means that 3 people would be left riding. That means 6 people can ride in the car.\n2. The answers are pig - oink and duck - quack.\n3. Two. The only combinations that would work are brown and blue and green and yellow. The other pair can't work, as one would be brown, with a red cup and a yellow cup. This would not make sense as there'd be a red cup with an orange cup, or a blue cup with a green cup.", "answer": "D: ohio"}
{"text": "Demolition: The words \"kids\" and \"apartment\" convey a college setting, while also suggesting that there are no fully functional living facilities available. This might come from lack of housing options, or it could be that the people living there have recently moved out of a bigger space, and have no fully functional furniture to fill it with.\n\nThe given phrase \"folding chair inside their room\" suggests that the living space they're occupying is small, that they must be using furniture that cannot be permanently fitted into their room, which further implies that this might not be a fully functional room. This can most likely be resolved only by moving out and getting one's own place, which we know from the context that college students do not have the money for.\n\nAs a whole, the given hints suggest that people (most likely college students) are currently stuck residing in a home that cannot be decorated and furnished, and must be satisfied with subpar living conditions due to financial constraints. The only word that fits this description is E: church, as churches usually do not have proper homes for congregants to stay in.\n\nAnswer: E: church.\n\n### Input (cont.): They were known for their incessant what? Choices: A: chainsmoking B: vandalism C: drinking D: chattering E: complaining F: racket\n\n### Responses:\n\nDemolition 1: The given words \"inexorable smoking\" suggests a habit incessantly performed during certain durations of time. As one might associate smoking with either pleasure or stress, and the given context that these people are most likely college students, we can infer that it is the act of smoking that is going on as long as the speaker is present. Therefore, since \"chattering\" involves having a very long and incessant conversation, it would not fit. There is no hint given that speakers might have the tendency of excessive talking, so this alternative is out. Complaining could apply to complaining about anything, which means it is still too vague an answer.

In the sentence that follows, \"his\" refers to the subject from the sentence above, and it's important to pay attention to the pronouns (the subject of the verb) in context in order to be able to correctly answer the question. We can see that the phrases \"got away with something\", \"had a great time\", and \"passed the exam\" all refer to things that the subject did.\n3. The subject then talks about what they did- how they got home, how well they passed their exam, or how happy they are that passed their exam, but what they did (studying in this case) is what is most important to the sentence, and the phrases above refer to actions, behaviors, or events, as opposed to feeling. Therefore, the most likely answer would be E.\nAnswer: E: \"that he passed the exam\"\n\n### Input A: I have just read that  many of us have a certain percentage of our brains that we never use, and can be damaged.

{"text": "The passage starts with the conjunction \u201cif\u201d and says that if one receives a letter from a friend (overseas), one might read it (which is not the case for other letters). Given that, the sentence may conclude that the letter has some unique feature that attracts the reader\u2019s attention or that the author wants to read the letter for some important reason because the conclusion says \u201cmight read\u201d which implies that the answer may contain a feature which prompts the reader to read it.\n\n### Rationale 1:\nThe rationale starts with \u201cpudding\u201d. The word \u201cpudding\u201d stands for a sweet food. In addition, the passage contains the word \u201cnews\u201d which stands for information related to what is happening in a particular place. Given that, the reader might receive the letter from overseas (e.g. foreign travelers or people returning to their homeland) and that this letter could be used as news if the reader is interested in something happening in the writer\u2019s country.\n\n### Choice (A): pudding. It turns out, given the information presented in the question and by analyzing the word \u201cpudding\u201d, that the writer has returned from overseas and wants to inform the reader of some news.\n### Rationale2:\nAfter writing \u201cpudding\u201d, the passage then mentions some interesting features by mentioning \u201cstrain\u201d. This can be interpreted as the writer has gone through some difficult times in his/her foreign traveling due to a difficult or strange country (e.g. war, poverty, etc.) or because of personal struggles like marriage, childbirth, death of family members, etc. Hence, the letter may include some interesting information related to the subject\u2019s difficulties and may make the reader read it more.\n\n### Answer: Choice (B): because of personal struggles\n\n### Input:[If](https://opentext.ubc.ca/chapter/writing-an-informative-essay/reading-comprehension-and-multiple- choice-items/) you could take a walk in the park before work, would you do so?

Thus, the only true logical answer would be doing homework. This also fits best as the wording \"getting a new radio\" is ambiguous.

{"text": "\"What could someone be doing that cannot be enjoyed by [someone who is] deaf people?\" Here we are given the context that something \"cannot be enjoyed,\" which narrows down the possible answers. The question also follows the formula A: ___ B: ___. These clues tell us that A, the first part of the sentence, describes a group of people, while B, the second part if the sentence, describes a type of activity. Based on this information, we can quickly cross off \"act\" and \"dance\" as choices: an act refers to behavior or speech and is not something one could not do, since everyone can act, while the same goes for dancing. This makes the remaining answers A: smoke, B: talk, or C: drink.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### 5.

This helps keep readers from being too surprised or shocked when they read certain content. An introductory clause helps the reader know what to expect. In this case, the idea of lunch is a type of a transition idea. This allows us to know that we will be given more information.\n\n2. We are given more information regarding the lunch, and the word \u201cbelieve\u201d in this sentence gives us a clue that is going to be talking about some religion or beliefs. \u201cbelieve\u201d is used to refer to things that you believe because you want more information about. \n\n3. Paragraphs begin with an introductory statement that describes a situation or what is going on with the author in some way.

{"text": "A: The most obvious place to find pamphlets is the health department, located at the local government. However, there are other possible locations; according to the passage, pamphlets can be found in drawers or mailboxes. While this might not seem important, it is clear that the \"or\" does not mean \"or\" but \"either\" or \"and.\"\nBased on the context, we can infer that:\n1. Pamphlets can be found at the health department if the sender's mailbox is not located there. As a result, it's safe to exclude the mailbox as a plausible location.\n2. Pamphlets can also be found in a drawer. This means that a drawer is a plausible location too.\n3. Pamphlets can additionally be found at theaters and libraries. A theater could provide pamphlets because it may have a health section, or because plays in general may include topics related to health concerns.

{"text": "The question contains three answers that all are adjectives that describe socializing or social skills, and we know that people socialize through trust and deception. The remaining one is an inappropriate answer that is used to refer to something being of poor quality. We can narrow down the answers to A: manipulative, B: charming, and C: deceitful.\n\n#### Manipulative and Charming: \n\nWe can analyze one of these two. Manipulative suggests that the agent is consciously or unconsciously leading the buyer to where she wants them. The word \"manipulative\" itself has many negative connotations, and asserts some of the characteristics of this scenario that the author is looking to find.\n\n#### Deceitful : \n\nThe word \"deceitful\" in this sentence doesn't say what level of deception the buyer experienced, and doesn't have any additional connotations that are relevant to this question. It is also not an adjective and therefore isn't the right answer.\n\n#### Exaggerate: \n\nThe word itself does not fit. It means to stretch the truth or tell something that is not true for effect. The phrase that proceeds the question does say that the agent was 'all around', so the word 'exaggerate' is redundant here.\n\n#### Incompetent: \n\nThe question does not mention whether the agent is competent or not, nor does it mention any other adjective besides the three that are the correct answers. Furthermore, the phrase \"the real estate agent was very...\" does suggest incompetence when used together with the previous phrase, as it puts the focus of the question on the agent's skill level, hence making the word incompetent an irrelevant option.\n\nTaking into consideration the hints given by the phrase \"to gain her trust,\" as well as the information from the preceding phrase, the correct answer is **B:** charming\n\nAnswer: B: charming\n\n### Instructions: \nInput: If the student\u2019s goal was to acquire basic skills in calculus, she should enroll in a program at the university where in calculus or physics B or  calculus or mathematics would have been taught.

{"text": "The request is a yes/no question (a \"yes\" response is to be given) with no clues from which the correct answer can be inferred. So the best answer would be either Choices:  A or B. I feel that a spreadsheet would seem like a more feasible solution than roman architecture for this kind of task because of the relatively modern era in which the statement's origin lies. Furthermore, to get a spreadsheet, all that would be needed is a computer and the ability to open a program, while to get roman architecture one would have to know the architecture and have access to it. Therefore, spreadsheet, or choice B, is preferred.\n\n### Input2: Which of the following is most likely to help increase the productivity of a factory? Choices:  a: increase in the size of the machinery b: lower wage rates c: lower material costs d: lower labor costs e: faster and more reliable machinery\n\n### Response2: The request is for the answer to be the choice that is \"most likely to help increase the production of a factory.\" The correct answer appears to be \"c\" because with lower price material, it is easier to make the correct product for the price at no extra cost of time. \"Speed to develop\" is a close second because it is faster to create a product with more efficient machinery, which translates to increasing productivity.\n\n\n\n### Input3: What did the man who could not feel cold do on a cold winter's night? Choices:  -A: He went into the cold with a thick jacket and got back into bed as a way to feel the cold. b: he walked around outside and watched the ice on his door melt from the cold. c: He went to a cabin in Alaska and lived there for 6 months as a way to understand the cold. d: The man felt comfortable because he had a hot cup of coffee in his hand\n\n### Response3: He would go into the cold with a jacket and a blanket to find a temperature in which he was still cold but more comfortable. If he went in too cold, he would go back inside. If he went in to hot, he would cool down and then go back outside.\n\n### Task: Identify the answer choices that are correct.

{"text": "Answer: B: fight enemy\n\n### Rationales:\n1. As with the initial problem, the main context again involves war. \"Your primary method\" is another clue that we can analyze together with the word \"primary,\" which is often used to describe the most important task in a collection. It therefore seems that in war we are to identify the \"primary method,\" suggesting our most important task.\n2. The word \"goal\" is an interesting clue, as it would indicate what we are ultimately shooting for. Combining the key context and these clues, we can determine that we are going for \"what,\" to be precise. What would this goal be in a war context?\n    - Conquering an enemy would be too broad and difficult to accomplish within the timeframe of the question, as it would take more than a few minutes. Fighting an enemy would be much more likely, and indeed there is also a word to hint at this. The word \"fight\" (along with \"combat\" from the initial phrase) could be the method we are seeking to identify.\n    - There is nothing in the question to suggest that \"doing what\" means to kill the enemy, which should be obvious given that the phrase in the question is \"your goal is to do what,\" not \"you want to do what\" or \"you need to do what\". In addition, the phrasing \"what you do in combat is the primary method\" would clearly suggest that the primary method would be a different phrase than what.\n3. While \"kill\" is a perfectly logical answer choice given the wordplay, the fact that the question states that we must answer \"what\" indicates that the correct answer should not be one where \"what\" appears again in the answer. \"Kill\" is a word that is also often used to be synonymous with \"kill or be killed,\" as in \"they don't have to be fighting to kill each other,\" again suggesting a very broad and unattainable goal as defined in the question.\n\n## See other questions in the series:\n1.

He also wanted to show his parents this project, which is why he also wanted to complete it before leaving for theirs. Input: What is the project he wants to complete before leaving for his parents? Choices:  None\n\n### Context:\nThe paragraph begins \"[He decided to visit his parents] to spend much time with [them]. [h]e also wanted [to] show [his parents] this project, which is [why] he also wanted [to] complete it before leaving for [their]s.\" \nThe second sentence mentions a project that he wants to complete before visiting his parents, and he wants to visit his parents for several reasons: he hasn't spent much time the parents in so long, he wants to see the parents before leaving, and he wants to show this project to the parents. \nHe is trying to complete all this within a very short time frame, and it is important for the story that he does so.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks for insight about the project the man needs to complete before leaving for the weekend. We can use the following clues to analyze this question:\n\n    1. The project must be something that he wants to show his parents\n    2. From the rest of the paragraph, we can deduce that completing it before leaving is important because he wants to leave on a good note\n    This suggests completing important (or at least notable) tasks before leaving is a priority for him, making it more likely the project is important.\n\n\n3. Also, taking the rest of this paragraph into account, the man is trying to complete the project before leaving for the long weekend at his parents. It is a very short time-frame, making it more likely that the project is not very time consuming.\n    4. Finally, we can note that the narrative is already introducing the project and the reasons for which he wants to complete it before he leaves, which suggests he is already invested in it and would like to finish it before leaving.\n\nCombining all this, the", "answer": "C: small group"}

Being lost is not a direct result of being with its owner, the dog would have gotten lost on its own somewhere and then looked for its way home.

{"text": "- The answer needs to be:\n- An advisory or a mandate, as the decision to evacuate had to be made beforehand, so the TV could not have broadcast the evacuation (it needs to be a TV signal, and the signal cannot be received without the mandate or advisory).\n- A mandate was given to evacuate the city, so the elective or optional answer does not fit.\n- Advisory and mandate both work. Hence, the correct choice would be either A or B. If a mandate is given, the TV would not have to continue advertising an elective or optional activity for the people. An advisory, on the other hand, does not carry the same weight as a mandate and would be broadcast on the radio or maybe only to selected people, rather than on the TV which would be broadcast to everyone. Hence, the correct response is A.\nAnswer: A: advisory\n\n### Input:(It rained on the day of the meeting.)  What did the people say to the speaker in response to his request? Choices: \tA: it's raining B: let's meet tomorrow C: there's nothing to do D: the window got cracked E: I forgot to bring an umbrella\n\n- There can be no cracks or broken window in the sentence since there's no speaker yet. Hence, it's not A.\n- The rain cannot cause someone to forget to bring an umbrealla and hence cannot be the reason for the decision to cancel the meeting. Hence, it' not B.\n- The decision to cancel the meeting in the premised scenario would not be related the speaker's request, but rather to the weather conditions. So, the choice cannot be A.\n- Whenever it rains, everything gets cancelled, even meetings. A cancelled meeting is called off, so the choice cannot be C.\nThis is where we need to read the word order from left to right. The speaker's name is not mentioned so the choice cannot be D.\n- All meetings are cancelled when it rains. Hence, if the meeting was to be cancelled, then the statement that it was raining would be redundant. So, the choice would be E.\nResponse: (The speaker said the meeting would not be postponed.)

Given that the explosion started on the top of the building, and the building collapsed on the man 25 meters below ground, we can tell that the man wasn't killed by explosion or the falling building, because the building fell about 20 to 30 meters below the man. The building exploded while it was 18-27 meters above the man, falling over 3.4m of collapsed earth below the man. This means that there was more air than earth beneath the man, which would be impossible if the collapsed building was on top of the man before the explosion. It's most likely that there was a gas leak and explosion started from a place that was above the man. The man was buried underground, so that he could have escaped. However, he fainted from the gasses or was unconscious and buried there. But with limited oxygen, his limbs started to turn stiff as his heart stopped.", "answer": "B: construction site"}
{"text": "The correct answer to this question is \"A: desire.\" This choice was selected because it is consistent with the definition of \"shopping.\" Shopping can be defined as seeking out, collecting, and purchasing products from various sources.

The rationales support the following choices:  C: that you and D: spending money because a person is likely going into a store because they want to eat something, but do not want to spend more money, and someone is likely going into a market rather than going into a restaurant alone and being alone with food implies someone is likely going into the market alone.\n5.

{"text": "The subject of the sentence is John whom the sentence claims to know to be very competitive. It is reasonable and appropriate to assume here that whichever qualities are specified in the remainder of the sentence will be in relation to John.\n\nTaking a look at the next clause, we find that \"he liked being able to divide people into\" categories, \"winners and losers.\" This does not seem to be very specific as to which specific people the subject can divide into these categories of winners and loser, although given that John is known to be competitive, we may assume he likes doing this to people around him.\n\nThe next clause is the one that introduces the categorisation itself: \"winning and losing.\" This means that the act of dividing people into winners and losers is something that John is able to do. This is, again, a vague and abstract notion, however, when thinking about the context, it stands to reason that John is able to categorize people into the groups of winners and losers in reference to an activity that John is able to participate in.\n\nTaking into consideration the rest of the sentence, it is possible to conjecture that what John can categorize people as is whether they \"perform better\" (i.e. whether they are skilled at performing something or not). This explanation is supported by the remaining part of the sentence, which mentions that John likes being able to \"divide people into [the categories of] people who [perform better and people] who might win.\"\n\nWith this conclusion in mind, the correct option is C: might win. The remaining choices are eliminated either due to being unrelated to the content of the sentence or by being not specific enough to the sentence's context.

{"text": "This was a very common problem in the AP test the other day.

A letter of encouragement\n2. A letter of gratitude\n\nI assume that as a first step, the writer asks for advice on how to write a letter of encouragement.\n\n1. \u201cHow would you respond if?\u201d\n   1. Your best friend got his/her dream job (offered a position of your dream)\n   2. Someone gave you a compliment\n   3. A teacher you respect acknowledges your qualities and ability\n   4. You realize that you are the top seller for your company\n\nWith these answers in mind, we can now look at the three response choices as follows:\n\n**C: attempt suicide**\n\nThis is most certainly not what the writer means to ask about, seeing as how the response choices imply that the writer will be penning one of two types of letters as a result: (a) a letter of encouragement, which is positive in nature, or (b) a letter of gratitude or compliments. Such letters would obviously not mention any attempts on suicide on the part of the writer, so we can eliminate choice C.\n\n**B: wave goodbye**\n\nAnother clear non-starter, given that the response choices don\u2019t ask what a person would do to send someone off, but rather how he would go about _writing_ to them. Choice B would perhaps be chosen if the writer\u2019s question involved a person actually leaving for another location or for a job, but as it\u2019s only the writer who is leaving, it\u2019s clear that what he is really interested in is just the nature of the letter.\n\n**E: thank God**\n\nThe same argument can be made about choice E. Clearly, if this is how the writer wanted to _send_ off a friend, colleague or peer, he wouldn\u2019t write it in the language of encouragement or gratitude he uses in response choices.

This reduces the options to two. \n\n- The supermarket is ruled out as irrelevant as well. Even if we could sell the foodstuff there, we would't be selling them at a roadside.

And another question is whether this is a true story or not, since we may have heard about such stories elsewhere.\n\nSo we've got the choice of dog or puppy, but not in the narrator's own life, and not based on real stories or events in the narrator' story, so it's got to be a figment of the narrator'", "answer": "E: garden"}

But, out of all of these what would stand out the most as a source of energy. The sun for many may seem like a logical answer, but that would actually not be the correct answer. \n\n### It would be the burning wood, due to the chemical reaction that takes place.

{"text": "Choices:  A: \"homeless shelter\"\n\n### Explanation:\nRationales:\n1. In a short story, the wife might be considered an alcoholic (probably on probation) and the husband might not, making \"homeless shelter\" the most plausible answer, as this is somewhere that alcoholics can be placed so that their addiction is in check.\n2. Alternatively, the story might only be about the husband and the choices might read \"What might the husband do,\" in which case the \"neighbor's house\" answer (if relevant) would become more plausible, but \"homeless shelter\" is still probably the correct choice anyway, because the husband might instead decide to go home where his wife could give him a beer or he could be arrested and placed somewhere else. This is supported by the fact that the options \"neighbor' s house\" and \"bridge\" are relatively close together in the problem. Additionally, choosing one of the other answers would result in a strange and illogical outcome if the author really wanted to draw the conclusion that \"neighbor\" had the most \"probabilities,\" because a home and a homeless shelter would not be equivalent in terms of likelyhood.", "answer": "A: neighbor's house"}

{"text": "Answer B: A sign that you might not live long is having children. It seems counterproductive, but it's the truth.\n\n### Rationales:\nFor each of the multiple choice answers, I will justify each answer choice with logical reasoning, as follows:\n\n- I could argue with A, which states a person could live \"soon\" if they are getting older. Yes, a person could live for much less time (or longer) than when they were 20 years old, but no, that does not mean they will. What if they are 40 years old already? They would be younger than when they were 30, but are they younger in relation to when they were 25? The 15 years they will have to live \"soon\" after 40 will still seem long.\n- I disagree with B. Sure, having children means you will need to take on more responsibilities and have more things to worry about, but there is a good chance it will not end up lasting for \"long\" in the grand scheme of things. Apart from the fact that an increased workload (responsibilities or not) can result in stress and even anxiety, it also reduces your time to actually enjoy the life that you worked so hard in order to have. And in the grand scheme of the universe, that 44/50 chance of living \"long\" could mean living another 90 years, and that's a very long time.\n- C and D are false. Perspiration is not a sign your life is \"soon\". It just means you have done a lot of exercising or work in the heat, which is unrelated to life expectancy.\n- Yes, shuddering can be a sign that you might die soon, as it could indicate that you are overheating. I'm not sure of the percentage this applies to, but it is true it is a possible symptom of an early death. However, I've never heard anyone refer to this as a \"sign\" that they might die soon, but as a symptom of some other condition. I could be wrong in this, but regardless, since I've never heard it used as a phrase which states that someone will die soon, I cannot mark E as a correct choice.\n- The only choice that really addresses this in a way that it \"could\" happen", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

Choices:  They work on teams or individually __________  A: only if they are working on a team B: all the time, in any environment C: rarely D: only if they are managing the team E: it depends on the situation and the task \n\nRationales: There is a lot of information in the original prompt that we can use to narrow our options. \n1. The word \"they\" indicates that these are characteristics that can be used to describe any manager. This suggests \"they work on teams\" is not an option; in that case, \"they\" would refer to managers in general. Additionally, managers are usually a group of one manager and the employees of their team.\n2. The next clue comes from the term \"has poor management skills.\" \n\t- If managers can manage their teams, then \"managing skills\" are something all managers would have.\n\t- If poor management skills are something that can be used to define any manager, then managers must have at least sometimes be able to work individually.\n\t- By comparing these statements and the information provided about managing, we can rule out D: work individually. \n3. Combining the two rules from the last two rationales, we know that all managers must have management skills, so we can discard option A. The same reasoning applies to B as well.\n4.

Choices: A: meat grinder, B: stable, C: red barn, D: gate, E: green field\nRationale: The cow wants to come outside, but after the storm passes, it must have gotten stuck inside. Hence, it will want to come outside after that and it would leave the stable. So our answer would be B: stable.\n\n### Explanation:\nIf you have doubts about the wording of your answer.\n\nIn this case, we found the correct answer by looking at the clues from the following statement:\n\n\"even after the storm had passed.\"\n\nIn English, \"Storm\" can refer to a severe or bad weather condition. For example, the storm can refer to rain, thunder and lightning, hail, and hurricanes, tornado, or typhoon. \n\nTherefore, it is logical to conclude that the cow was stuck by a severe weather condition and in order to come out it had to overcome the barrier.

The term Modern style, generally speaking, refers to a period from the mid-1920s until World War II. The movement was more concerned with being innovative than with being traditional.

It is highly likely that if you have a vintage decorative light source in your possession, it is a lamp as lighting is very highly relevant to a decorative setting. While other light sources such as the sky are also decorative in nature, candle, house and sun are not as commonly used for decorative use. Lamps, on the other hand, are a great addition to the decorative atmosphere of any room.\n2. The problem description states that the subject has a vintage decoration light source in their possession, implying that it has a retro feel or old vintage vibe. Lamp can be used in many situations to create a unique, warm and welcoming atmosphere.\n3.

Where is James?\n\nWe don't know where James is. The sentence only tells us he lives in a tower and can observe cloud from his window.\n\nQuestion 2. Does James live in a cloud? I think not.\n\nAgain this question is unclear what is meant by \"looks out\". We don't know if he looks out of a window out of a cloud. Or if \"look out\" means he's just observing cloud from his window, and that he is living in a tower. If we go by logic, the sentence reads \"He could see clouds,\" as a passive sentence. So it should be \"He could have been (the part not written) in a cloud\" or it's a mistake if the question is \"where is he observing cloud from\".\n\nQuestion 3. Does he live in the tower?\n\nIt doesn't says how tall the tower is or what James wants to make of it.

{"text": "Answer: A: murder\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question. \n\n### Demoscene:In the world of early computer graphics, computer hackers and artists were inventing ways to create new animated effects. Soon a community of people was experimenting with new animation art styles and programs. This community, known as the demoscene, began in 1984 in Sweden with the creation of a computer program. To get a copy of the program the user would have to mail their name and mailing address to a special address. It was in this program that the person would get a screening of their very own movie, created by a software hack called a demo or demo movie. To make your name stand out from everyone else a special name for your computer hacking group was required. The creator named the group Demo or Demo Group. \n\nAfter the movie and demonstration, people started to become interested. They began to create their own demo, or demos. The hackers in this community were more than happy to help teach those who wanted to learn. The art style was named after a program created to display new effects called an ASSEMbly. A demo could range from a few minutes to as long as an hour. \n\nBy 1986 there were many democreations in Europe, so democreations began to show their work at demo parties. This was a time period that people would go and show off their creations, have fun watching other people's demos and discuss and help each other. The democreators had a competition to see who could make the most elaborate and creative demo. The winner received a prize. By the early 1990s, there were more than 20 demo parties a year. \n\nDemos had started to appear on VHS tapes. But still many people wanted to find out more about them, so they would buy cassette tapes of demos, known as demoscene. There was a demo party hosted by The Netherlands called The Party 2. This group made sure every demo cassette tape had three things: \n* An introduction\n* Background music (known as intros or music demos)\n* The demos that the party was known for (e.g. demoscene)\n\nTowards the end of the 1990\u2019s", "answer": "E: evil"}

For instance, the answer choices A-D are all out of the question, as they are referring to telephone booths that are not red \u2014 this is also a key hint that we are looking at something related to a city since cities often have a red phonebox, and the answer should either point to a real city or a fictional one.\n\nThe wording \u201clikely\u201d is a key clue to the correct answer, since the idea of a \u201clikely\u201d place to find a red phonebox is to say that it is highly prevalent in that place. We can eliminate the places that don\u2019t fit this. Choices B and C describe fictional cities (Gotham and London), which do not likely have red phoneboxes.

{"text": "Answer: B) Wristwatch\n\n### Explain:\nThis question is asking us to guess the item referred to in the sentence.\n\nThe first clue in this problem is the use of the term \"today's people.\" This points to a trend or custom that exists in general, with no specific person in mind. Another clue is the use of the phrase \"at one time.\"\n\nThe second clue comes from the choice of words in the sentence's clause. \"Today's people have...\" suggests something that people own now. The word \"posession\" suggests ownership, and \"posession\" is often used in the context of one's own home, or office.\n\nAfter the question has been posed, more clues are given in the following parts of the sentence. First, the fact that the item was cutting edge to have at the time suggests that it held a high level of status and was desirable.\n\nSecond, it was placed in a container, \"the briefcase.\"\n\nThird, it was portable, because it was used with something else (the phrase \"together\").\n\nThe items that can check all those boxes are the \"mobile phone,\" though this may be surprising at first.\n\nWhy would a mobile or cell phone have been cutting-edge? And why would this have been the status symbol back in the day, instead of a smart watch?\n\nThe first question can be answered by a little knowledge of the history of the mobile phone. Initially, the mobile phone was huge and awkward to carry around. Its biggest \"problem\" was that its battery tended to explode after a few hours of use, and it lacked the ability to play music or store an amazing number of songs.\n\nThe second question can be answered by another factoid from history. In days gone by, some people liked to see how large of a watch they can have. In fact, there were companies that produced watches with very tiny faces and exquisite timepieces.\n\nPutting the two facts together means that the cutting edge item back then was the mobile phone.", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

This question also contains the word \"losing\", which means there could be something lost involved in this activity, but we can tell that it is not money and it is not implied, so we can safely rule this answer out. We also can't use the word \"win\", as cards being used for betting seems to out of place for the context.\n4. This phrase, as well as the word \"win\", could also refer to victory.

{"text": "The answer is b.\n\n### Explanation:\nThis is a little harder than the previous problem, the instruction itself is more open-ended then the last, and also contains more clues for the user to take advantage of.\n\nThe instruction first states that a character \"called bull\" when his friend said that it is \"feeble\" to call a bull what. This phrasing is extremely vague, as \"feeble\" doesn't mean what it says literally. Therefore, the first clue we have to take into account is that the character did not agree with this assessment. The friend's suggestion is to call a bull \"feeble\" which is a strange request and makes us think the friend's suggestion was meant to be a joke. We can also reasonably assume that the friend's assessment of feeble is to say that it is useless or has no meaning.\n\nThe second clue is in the instruction itself, which mentions that the object of the friend's insult was a bull (and not, for example, some other animal), and that it was insulted. We can also infer that the bull was not \"charging prey\" at that point in time for no good reason, nor was it female, and also not a cow.\n\nAnother clue is the friend referring to the animal as \"bull,\" which may be a typo, or it can be an indication that whatever the friend was saying, it was obviously connected to the concept of a bull.\n\nThe question asks, \"what is a bull?\" This is quite vague. The instruction itself provides some more context, by mentioning that the subject of this question is someone who \"called bull,\" which is referring to the same character as the subject in the question. Thus, we can narrow our scope to that friend only. We also have the two clues that the friend is calling whatever is being insulted feeble, and it is obviously connected to the concept bull. There is no evidence as to why the friend is insulting the bull, but it appears to be something unrelated to its gender, its status, its charges, or any of the other characteristics that the answer options allude to.\n\nAfter taking these cues into account, the first answer that appears to logically be ruled out (since it is a word that pertains to its gender)", "answer": "D: female"}

Logic: Given this context and the clues provided, all logical responses would either involve a call or an assurance that s/he was working on the assignment, as leaving the class would be an impolite response, and a teacher who tells the child that it is impossible to get the work done would likely be the last person who would want to hear an assurance or an assurance that the assignment was not possible.\n\nHence, the only logical answer choice must be either a call to the teacher or a statement that the student will complete the homework regardless. \nAnswer: D: tell my teacher why it is impossible to complete the homework (if you think that they are telling her/him to tell them that there was a problem with their assignment, or that they should tell her/him that they were not going to do the work, and the statement can be considered an assurance in that sense.)\n\n### Input Do you think it really worth spending almost 10k on some new shoe?\n\n### Response \nInput Do you __________ spending almost 1,00?

Taking this into consideration, the logical choice for the second word is \"work\" because it refers to labor or how someone earns a living. \"Wealth\" would also mean the same thing, but given that the next word \"save\" (in this context) refers to financial stability, \"work\" is the more correct choice.\n\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n### Input He fantasied about new car boredom, impatient, pressure.

It is also a fact that roving bands of monters are trying to kill people. Lastly, panic, mass hysteria and being convicted of murder are all bad things that can happen to the one that spreads that particular rumor. 2.- The word roving sounds like it has a relationship to the subject, so you could probably assume that who spreads the rumor is the one that is in trouble. 3.- It is also possible to narrow down the list of answers just by the fact that the monsters are trying to Kill people, so you could probably narrow it down to panic of getting in trouble.\n\n### Input : The person has to deal what to many, so the next move for the team is to hire another who will do what?

{"text": "The question asks us whether or not we should walk barefoot after it\u2019s rained, and provides some information as to the reasons for caution: the ground is wet, clothes are wet, and we might fall. However, the question omits a vital piece of information: water.\n\nWe can logically deduce that water, more specifically, the rain, is the reason not to walk barefoot after the rain. Why? If we\u2019re walking after a rainfall, we will almost certainly be walking in puddles of water, which could be slippery, so what are more common reasons not to walk barefoot in the rain is the water in our clothes and on the wet ground.\n\nSince the question provides the information to us and the reasons we should not walk barefoot are so logical and common sense, the answer should instead be \"A: shoes.\"\n\nAnswer: A: shoes\n\n### Input He was a what that went on many errands in his horse-drawn carriage and was quite a hero in the community?\n\n### Response The question is asking us what the man was with a somewhat cryptic hint, referring to people who go on errands and are heroes in the community, i.e. a \"horse-drawn carriage\" and \"errands\" are usually associated with historical time periods and the question implies someone in a relatively prominent position in town, so we have to think:\n\nThere are many possible answers, but we\u2019d want to eliminate anything that would be a bit far-fetched such as \"lighthouse-keeper\" or \"lamp-lighter.\"\n\nFinding a historical connection would be helpful, for example, the phrasing \"horse-drawed carriage\" makes us think of the late 18th to early 20th century, so we can eliminate any time pre-1900.\n\nThe phrase in question is really important, as it is a hint. \"Hero in the community\" is another hint: it\u2019s probably an important person in the community, and hero in our time is a bit different than hero in the community so what was a hero for the community during that time?\n\nIn terms of being quests, we\u2019d need to be someone of importance to warrant the time, so maybe a judge or mayor?

{"text": "Input: Where can you get in shape in drink at a juice  bar?\n\n### Instructions: Use context on the problem to answer the next question.\n\n## Demonstration: If the fridge were being cleaned out, then it could mean that the fridge  would be emptied out, which would mean that it would have things in it. If\n there were no things in fridge, it would be empty.\n\n## Rationale: Since you have nothing or nothing else, it can be concluded that it is not full, which means the most logical answer is A: limejuice, so the correct answer is A: limes\n\n## Alternative analysis\n\nThis problem can be analysed several other ways. For example, one could first realize that the fridge needs to be cleaned out because there is something in it but not a lot, making it most likely a juice or a bar. This kind of analysis is not recommended since the reasoning is far too simplistic and may lead to mistakes.\n\n## Multiple choice questions\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed a simple, single-question question. However, multiple choice questions also make use of context clues.\n\n\n## Context clue examples\n\nThe best way to find context clues is by looking at where the context comes on the page. If the context comes after a description or before a definition, it is probably a definition of the given term. If it is an explanation for something that you are expected to already know, it is probably a synonym for that term. If it is a follow-up, it is most likely asking what you would do in that situation.\n\n### Example:\n\nInput: Who is my best friend? Choices: 1) A: Mike 2) B: Tim 3) C: Jim 4) D: Kyle\n\n### Rationale\n\nFrom the question, you can tell that the best friend is one you should already know and not a new one. The word 'best' implies not only a preference for the given term but also that the given term is more or less important than the other terms. If the other terms are also best friends of yours, then you can rule out B and C, making it the most logical answer D, which is true if you are a middle-schooler for whom this question might be asked.

However, A is clearly negated, as we are told that we are waiting in a \"reception area\" and nothing in the definition of reception area as described in the dictionary suggests that one has to be staying there. Option D is also ruled out, as a \"law firm\" is not a location where one would wait, and option E is ruled out by context, as the preceding sentence states that the subject is waiting for a meeting, for which an office building would also not be a reasonable place.\n\nThe only remaining option is therefore C: the hotel, which fits exactly into the context of the prompt and also corresponds to the definition of reception areas given in the dictionary.\n\n### Input Where did your grandparents take a group selfie using their smartphone and what happened that the group selfie was ruined?\n\n### Response Where did your... A: uncle B: aunt C: grandfather D: daughter E: grandmother\n\n### Exploration:\nThe first part of the sentence tells us that the subjects are talking about their grandparents. One would assume that they are using their phones to send photos to each other. The second part tells us that the group selfie has been ruined, which could mean that the grandparents attempted to take a group photo and either the group disbanded, were unable to take the photo, or did not save the photo.\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer to this question would be C, E. Only these options describe the grandparents as having taken a group selfie and the photo as being ruined.\nA, B and D describe the grandparent taking a standard photo and the grandchildren not ruining the photo. As such, it would have worked too, but this is not what the question was asking for.\n\n### Exclusion\n\n### Exclude:", "answer": "E: office building"}
{"text": "### Dem: \nInput: How many states was Abraham Lincoln from? Choices: A: 2 B: 13 C: 10 D: 0 E: 15\nRationales: The question starts with Abraham Lincoln, which implies the subject will come from somewhere. If they're multiple choices but one of them has to be true and one of them false, the number choice will be false.\nSo the only true answer will be 0 or 1.\nHowever, 15 is a multiple of 3, meaning it's false. 0 is a prime number, it's true.\nAnswer: 0\n\n### Input:\"There is no better friend of the people of India than Congress\" is best illustrated by which of the following? Choices: 1. The 2017 election of Shukhendu Roy 2. The party's manifesto 3. The 25th Congress in 1970 4. P. V. Narasimha Rao 5. Tamil Nadu government's attempt to ban casteism and support Dalits\nRationales: All of the above except option 5 are best illustrated with Congress. 1. Manifesto- Congress has often claimed to be a proponent for people who needs to be empowered.\n2. Rao- In 2017, Congress's manifesto focused heavily on casteism and poverty.\n3. 1970- In the 1970s, the Naxalites rose up as a revolutionary force and Congress was in favor of this.\n4. Narasimha- He was a very popular Congress member and had close connections to the Dalits.\nBased on the rationales above, the correct answer would probably be 2. Congress's manifesto was best illustrated in 2017 during P. V. Narashimha's time when Congress focused on poverty and empowerment of people. The correct answer would probably be option 2.\n\n### Input\"Through the hard work and dedication of this team, I believe we'll achieve our goals\" is best illustrated by the which of the following? 1.

The first clue that \"menth\" refers to the \"mind\" is that the next word (\"learn\") is the verb form of the word \"learn\". This suggests that \"menth\" is either an example of the word or it is an indication of the word that proceeds it.\n`2. Looking at the choices, only \"menth\" would make sense for this.

Firstly, we are told that a good rule of thumb is that if the first two words are \"A...\" and \"B...\" (the first letters of the three choices) then the third option must be \"C...\", which is not the case with the choices given. This means that the third option must be the opposite of the other two choices, making \"the other...\" the correct answer.\nMoreover, we are told that A is a snake (as the \"first\" option), B is an ant (as the third option)  and C is a caterpillar. This confirms that the opposite of a snake and an ant is a caterpiller and the first choice must be a caterpillars. Finally, we are told that caterpillars let the first what go and rest when it is done. This suggests that the previous options were snake and ant and that the first one should be caterpillar, the second snake and the third Ant.\nTherefore, according to the clues given, the correct option would be C: caterpillars, as they let the first what go (they eat the leaf) and they rest when they are done with the leaf.

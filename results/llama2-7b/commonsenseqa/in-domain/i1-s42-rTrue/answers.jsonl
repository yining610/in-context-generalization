In the context sentence, we can see that \"Google maps\" is used to mean \"a service\" used for navigation, \n3. The answer \"map\" is a singular noun, which can be used for navigation, and can be used in the plural form, for several maps. \n4. In the context sentence \"we\" refers to \"we do not need to find our own way around\". This could also be referring to maps as in \"we need no maps\" which are both singular, so the answer would be \"map\" as singular.\nIn the context sentence, the words used can not be interchanged, \"replaced\" means eliminated, and \"map\" doesn't make sense in all of the words in the choices.  \n\n### Input:\"I've never been to Africa, but I would love to see it one day.\" what is the intended meaning of the sentence?

{"text": "The answer to the question above is \"anguish.\" In order to determine the answer, we should first analyze the question sentence:\n\n\"Before getting a divorce...?\"\n\nThis phrase implies that the speaker is answering a question, likely from the wife. This provides clues to the type of emotions the wife was experiencing before the divorce, which are generally related to being in a romantic relationship and doing domestic work for one's spouse.\nNext, we should consider the subject of the question:\n\n\"the wife\"\n\nBecause the subject is a woman, we should assume that she's speaking to her husband and refer to her as \"the wife\" rather than \"husband.\" It wouldn't make sense to use \"the husband\" in response to a question about the wife's emotions, as these would likely be about doing domestic work for her husband.\nNext, we must determine the emotions the wife was feeling:\n\n\"who was doing all the work?\"\n\nThis question implies that the wife perceives the husband as being lazy or unmotivated in performing household tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, or taking care of children. It's possible that the husband was actually completing these tasks but that the wife was resentful due to gender stereotypes, which assume female primary responsibility and male privilege.\nFinally, the answer to the question will depend on the wife's feelings about doing this work:\n\n\"what did the wife feel who...??\"\n\nHere, we're focusing on feelings after completing an action, not the action itself. Therefore, the answer choice must be an emotion, not a physical action, such as \"work.\"\nSo, we can combine these inferences to identify the correct answer choice, which is \"anguish.\" To recap, the answer is C: anguish.", "answer": "C: bitterness"}

{"text": "I would start looking in neighborhoods. A house that is gated off is a common sign of a neighborhood, as gated communities exist to seal a home from other things and people. \n\n### Rationale:\nThe question is designed to elicit the answer \"neighborhood,\" which we can get by following the logical steps to solve the problem. Neighborhoods are communities built around a specific location, are enclosed by gates to keep everyone safe, and contain houses of various types. Therefore, our possible answers would have to be neighborhood, maybe subdivision (due to the wording \"from other places\"), or city. We can eliminate options D, E, and C as they would not contain houses. As far as the question is asking for a \"where to start looking,\" a neighborhood fits the bill, indicating that a gated house would indicate membership to the neighborhood. Thus, the neighborhood is the correct answer choice B: neighborhood.\n\n### Input\nWhat would she ask her husband if she wanted to go to a movie on a Friday night? Choices: 1.

E: Do you mind if I invite an extra friend?\n\n### Response\n\"Where should we go?\"\nIt doesn't mention anything about time, and the question just states \"Friday night\".\n\n### Rational:\nThe wording of the question indicates that we can take the assumption that we are not asked to choose the most likely scenario, but rather one where the situation is given, the husband is free, so they have plenty of time with nothing else to do. The husband and wife have planned to go to the movie together, so we are looking at one of the remaining options. As we are looking to go to a movie, the logical choice of 3 is the correct one. Going to the movies requires some form or transportation (be that with or without a driver), an activity, and a couple for people. We are assuming movies are a shared activity and the man can do the driving, so 1 and 2 are eliminated. This leaves us with 1, 3, and 5 as logical answers.

{"text": "What you mean brain problems? Sitting up close while watching TV causes you to get fat.\n\n### Output: Headache\n\n### Rationales: 1: The question states that sitting too close to a TV can cause what? We are expected to analyze the structure of the question and figure out what exactly is causing the problem. The logical choice is \"sitting up close to the TV.\"\n2. Now let's see what we can take from that statement in order to come up with a possible solution.\n    - The statement says that sitting up close to the TV causes what. We are not interested in the effect of this event but in its cause. What do we know about sitting up close to the tv that may cause a headache? Well, we sit too close and squint and look at it for too long and that sort of thing, hence the logical explanation would be 'getting a headache.'\n3. Let's analyze the choices again. The only thing that causes a headache is excess exposure to light. Hence, the correct choice has to be \"get fat.\"\nAnswer: C: get fat\n\n### Input:(Driving on the Interstate) is fun. Is fun. Is boring what you think?\n\n### Response:(Driving on I-20) is boring what you think.\n\n###  Output:(Fantasizing on your drive to work) is fun. Is fantasizing fun?\n\n### Rationale. 1. Is fun is a sentence which is ambiguous. It can be interpreted as asking what we think about something based on its description (is fun a definition phrase or an adjective phrase, in this case?). The question tells us about what the subject is doing, so we can narrow it down by analyzing the sentences.\n2. Fantasizing is generally boring. Fun is something enjoyable, light-hearted, cheerful, etc., so \"fantasizing about something fun\" is inherently contradictory. Therefore, based on the context, the only logical conclusion is that fun = \"is boring.\" We can infer from this that 'is fun.' is a phrase meaning \"doesn't give you fun,\" or \"isn't fun.\" Thus a good way to respond to this question would be \"(Driving on the interstate) is ______ what you think?\".", "answer": "D: headache"}

{"text": "The answer in this question is under rocks.\n\n### Explanation: \nWe can infer this choice based the given context, specifically that \"fungus grow(s)\" and \"sunlight not be disturbed.\" These clues might suggest a moist environment, such as soil or mud, with no bright sunlight. While some fungi live in soil, many (such as mushrooms and molds) grow on dead plant material that is damp, or in the moist environment inside of decaying trees. Fungal growth is therefore excluded in options B (Manhattan) and D (the grocery store), while A (under rocks) can be ruled out by virtue of sunlight being mentioned in the problem.

But the book must also be useful, and be a good story. So it can't be option B. Similarly we can eliminate option D. \n\n### Explination\n1. Option A is the first one to be eliminated because it can't be all three \n2. Option D can be eliminated because option D says that a book has to have an interesting title.

Option C can be eliminated because it says that the book has to be a good story and be useful. But it can only be a good story... Hence by process of elimination, the option left is B.

{"text": "Demonstration:\n\nRationales:\n\n1. \"angry after getting drunk\" is the key phrase.\n2. The question is whether the person who gets angry after getting drunken is more likely to \"participate in\" something. The key word is *participate in,* which suggests that they may engage in some kind of action or activity that involves more than one person. In this context, it could refer to a sports game, or even just a game or friendly competition involving more than one person.\n3. Violent behavior or physical altercations are the only valid responses, as a person who engages in this type of behavior in the setting of alcohol consumption is more likely to have a drunk driving charge added to their aresenal of driving offenses. Vomiting is a sign of drunkenness, but it does not make someone an angry, irritable, or belligerent person. In fact, many people feel less inhibited and more relaxed after getting drunk, but this is not what the context demands.\n4.

Here's the logical process I took.\n\nFirst, I looked up the definitions of \"picnic\" and \"table\", since \"table\" was on the list, but not the answer.\n\n1. Picnic -- Out-of-doors meal; originally served on a table, now (especially of large public ones) often served buffet-style\n2. Table -- A flat horizontal surface fixed vertically upright at a height convenient for working at\n\nBased on this look up, I knew that picnic could not be the right answer because it required a table. We eliminated it immediately.\n\nNext, I reviewed the phrases: \"space shuttle\" and \"friend's house\". Based on their definitions, I knew that these were not plausible answers.\n\n* Space Shuttle -- Aerospace vehicle designed to carry a spacecraft into low Earth orbit.\n* Friend House -- House used for entertainment or pleasure; lodging and meals provided informally by a friend, relative, or other person\n\nSpace Shuttle is obviously not the right answer, and I have no connection to a friend whose house could host a game. Also eliminated.\n\nFinally, we consider \"fairground\" and \"food\". As we look this up we note that \"a fair is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities.\" This tells us they are meeting somewhere fun.\n\n\"Food\" is a more difficult keyword to research, so let's keep it brief.\n\n1. Food -- Any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink, or that plants absorb, and use as fuel. [syn. sustenance]\n\nSustenance makes sense on the body scale, but the clues don't offer up \"food\" with such a small scale. I would be surprised if the food they ate at this gathering were not eaten by hand. So I move past to the next", "answer": "B: friend's house"}

However, when the context of the conversation in the paragraph is considered, the conclusion is clear that the subject is talking about something they were fantasizing, or having good thoughts (during their drive to work. \n\n2) The main text in the yellow box states that the subject was fantasizing, and the second part of the second sentence gives us an idea of  what the subject may be thinking about. As the phrase \u201cpros and cons of\u201d suggests a decision-making process, it\u2019s likely the subject was fantasyzing about either receiving a promotion or getting a new position in the company.\n\n3) The text seems to indicate that the \u201cpros and cons\u201d would be some extra responsibilities that were expected of this new position as indicated by the context of the conversation. The \u201cpros\u201d side of the coin, would likely be the benefits. The \u201cpromotion\u201d choice in the answer choices most closely matches these clues, which supports the idea that the subject was fantasyizing about getting a promotion during their drive to work.\n\n***\n# \ud83d\udcd0\ud83d\udcd0Analysis:\n\n#  1.

{"text": "The context of the question hints that \"his friend\" means someone who plays sports and uses the gym for other activities, like fitness training. The answer should fit the same environment as that friend, so a public pool would be appropriate.\n\n### Input:- She is thinking about applying for the job with many other people what does this suggest? Choices: \nA:  the job is hard work and only for the people with experience\nB:  they are looking for many applicants and they will have many choices\nC:  the interview is in a big building and they should arrive on time\nD:  the job was posted in the newspaper by the boss a long time ago\nE:  it is their hobby, they love it and they want to do it full time\nRationales:- She is thinking about applies to a job with many other people; what does this suggest?\n1. They're going to require a job interview.\n2. There's a possibility there's several people applying for the job.\n3. There is a chance that there are open positions for the job.\n4. There is a chance the job doesn't need a lot of experience.\n5. There is a higher chance of getting hired.\nIt is hard to interpret this answer as it relies on an assumption that the \"she\" is thinking about applying for a specific job and the answer (which is \"it is their hobby\") doesn't match it. Instead, we must narrow it down to any possible answers from the choices given to her and match the description of the answer to the context. However, there is clearly a lot of ambiguity here as they may be applying for any kind of job with other people and there is no context to make a judgment.\n\n###Instructions:Answer the following short answer question.\n\n## Example:", "answer": "D: park"}
{"text": "The correct answer is A: top of home.\n### Rationales: \n1. The word \"home\" refers to a house or dwelling, which means that we can eliminate choices B; C; and D. That leaves us with answer A: top of home as the only remaining plausible answer left.\n2. An attic would be a logical place to store historical items, but only from houses that are old enough, and the choice implies that this is indeed the case. That leaves us with choice E: material, and indeed, a house filled with historical materials would fit neatly within the context of the prompt, and as such, is the correct answer.\nAnswer A\n\n### Input:(a) What is the probability of picking a prime number in a single roll of a 6-sided die? Choices: 1: 1/7 2: 1/6 3: 1/5 4: 1/3 5: 1/2 Rationales:\n1. The word choice \"a\" means that we are not given a specific example of picking a number in a six-sided die, and consequently cannot assume the die was used once. Therefore, we are likely to be presented with multiple dice roles or otherwise rolled numbers.\n2. The choice \"single roll of a 6 sided die\" gives us further information about the die in that it is a 6-sde die and one role would likely be more than enough to answer this question.\n3.  The answer would be a 1 or a 4 if we could pick the number after the die has been rolled once and we know what number we got from the dice.\n4. There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 six-sided dice in total.\n5. There 7 categories of options available; 2, 1, 5. \nIf you want to choose a prime number, you may have to roll the dice 5 times.\nBut if there are 5 categories of options available on the dice, the probability of the chosen category is 1/5.\nTherefore, the probability of picking the prime number in the six-sided die: Choices: 1/144 (1/2*1/6) Which is 1/5*1/2.

{"text": "<answer></answer>\n\n### Demystified:\nTo solve this problem, we need to interpret the question so that we are looking for a word that can be used to \"instruct,\" or teach in a more general sense, rather than \"instruct children attending school.\"\n\nOne way to do this is to focus on the word \"properly.\" It is not clear whether simply instructing children attending school would be \"proper,\" but the implication is that the answer needs to be something to \"properly instruct.\" Once we have this clue, we need to narrow down the list of possibilities.\n\nThe first word our mind will jump to is \"education,\" and while it is obvious that education is important when teaching, we need a more specific word than the root \"educ-\" can offer.\n\nAnother possible word is \"instruction,\" as in \"instruction manual.\" Although this is a useful hint, we can eliminate answers beginning with this word, as it is clear that they will not be specific enough to \"properly\" teach children.\n\nWe turn our attention to the word \"children,\" which could narrow our guesses down to words that have something to do with childhood. However, just because the children are young does not mean that their needs are \"childish,\" and the opposite might be true. We need to identify another clue that gives us more information.\n\nFrom the first question's list of clues, we see that we were asked for a term to describe something that could be fantasized about while on a commute. One could easily fantasize about taking a promotion, but not necessarily about a boring or patience-testing job. This gives us a useful clue if we are looking for something that could be considered \"desirable\" or \"good.\" We have an extra tip-off that it is something people can \"consider,\" since we asked them to consider what they \"deserved.\" This suggests that it will be positive, as in a reward.\n\nWe see that \"inspiration\" is a somewhat odd choice. We are talking about teaching children, and the word \"inspiration\" does not seem to necessarily dovetail with children. However, the word \"inspire\" is used to cause someone to become eager in one's presence, which could mean that when a child feels inspired by you, they are eager to receive instruction", "answer": "B: patience"}

In that way the dog has good protein which would help build its muscles.

This goal makes one of the following five possible answers reasonable:\n    - If these people are all going to the same conference about a new business, organization, etc., it could be done to learn more about how it operates. This is unlikely though, so I'm going to rule this option out.\n    - Another possibility is that this new business will receive a lot of free advertising.

This is definitely possible, but what the question says is that there will be plenty of people involved with this event, so they might already be members. I'll put this down as well.\n    - The last, final candidate is that the people involved in this conference will be given some sort of promotion, such as a job, salary, etc. This is the only one I think will work, so I'll say that the goal of telling many of these people is to give someone a job or make sure they know about it.\n    - And with that, I believe our goal is established: making someone know about a new organisation so someone can get a promotion.

Thus, the relationship must be the same as that of the girlfriend, which can be a girlfriend, wife, ex-girlfriend, ex-wife, etc.\nThe options are all grammatical constructs, so we need to deduce the type of relationship indicated by the use of a guy using the word \"girlfriends.\" We can analyze each of the given answer choices in turn:\n1. \"Girlfriend with no strings attached\" describes the type of girlfriend to whose relationships the man had no expectations or commitments, such as no strings attached girlfriends.\n2. \"One that is over\" is an ambiguous phrase that can be referring to a one-sided relationship over, or the relationship is over.\n3. \"Emotional\" is the description of the type of relationship that has emotional aspects to it, such as a romantic relationship.\n4. \"Abusive\" is also ambiguous, but suggests a relationship with \"strings attached\", in this case to describe negative feelings that may be felt in such a relationship.\n5. \"temporary\" is also ambiguous and can refer to either the duration of the relationship, or how the relationship feels.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer choice which provides the most information as to what the phrase \"girlfriend\" implies is \"Emotional\", option C: emotional, which describes a relationship in the context of which a man talks about having a girlfriend.\nAnswer: C: Emotional", "answer": "C: happiness"}

{"text": "In the context of the question, the speaker is trying to describe something that is difficult to obtain or locate, in this case, paper that is large enough for poster creation. It is most likely that they are trying to find large poster paper, not just any paper that is large.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The context of the question implies that poster paper is desired. Given that the speaker's end goal is to locate a place where they can purchase large poster paper, the most likely location to find such paper is a large store that sells office supplies, not a suitcase.\n2. Similarly, it is unlikely that one would buy large paper from their printer. The context of the entire question implies that poster paper purchased from an office supply store is the desired method of obtaining said paper, not buying the paper from their computer printer.\n3. Although \"artist's studio\" is a valid option, it seems unlikely that the speaker is asking where one might buy large poster paper from the artist's studio. Most likely the speaker is looking to buy poster paper from an office supply store since they did not include this option. The answer to the question is C: office supply store.\nAnswer: C: office supply store\n\n### Input : The best way to improve your golf swing would be by practicing with the following:  A: a heavy golf club when your hand grip is too strong B: a light golf club when your grip is too weak C: a shorter club or a club with less loft (slope) D: a club with a larger, thicker head when your swing is too long E: a club with a smaller, thinner head when your swing is inconsistent\n\n### Response :\nAn expert in the game of golf makes a number of judgments about how to improve a person's swing: the amount of loft or slope in the club, the length of the swing, and the pressure applied to the grip. Golf clubs come in many shapes, sizes, and types. A good golfer can choose the right club for the specific situation to improve their play.\n\nAnalysis\n\nPiece by piece, the question suggests an improvement in one specific component of one's game.

This is where they are hit.\n\n### Illustration based question\n\nI used my logic that the clues were \"bouncy balls\" \"rest\" and \"active\" and the text was \"James's bounying rubber...\".\n\nAfter analyzing the clues, I drew a conclusion that the text was referring to an object which I decided to be a bouncing rubber ball.\n\nThe text also stated that it was in rest in the morning, and this allowed me to come to the most likely conclusion of the bouncing object being the rubber ball that was used for batting practice.\n\nFor the second statement", "answer": "B: in motion"}

The first word of the question, \"Where\", leads the reader to imagine a location or place. \"Is a system\" suggests a set or collection of many things, often electronics, as well as a structure, and further, the question explicitly identifies the topic as school.\n2. The last word of the question, \"...likely to be used,\" is often an adverbial phrase introducing an assumption about the topic. This gives us a hint towards the correct answer.\n3. The answer choices are: \"nature\" suggests plants, animals, and the outdoors, \"toilet\" refers to a bathroom, \"computer science\" suggests computer programs or coding, and \"computer store\" refers to a shop. These choices may seem related to a school, but their specific wording and phrasing are not as obviously relevant as the others, and therefore are not the correct answer.\n4.

Now, let's look at another part of the sentence.\n\n### The crab was scuttles... \nWe can deduce that the crab was already \"strained\" when he started to walk, since he is walking at all.

It is most obvious that some of her story would take place during the _ phase, as she'd be standing in _ of people.

{"text": "In order to answer this question, we need further context, either the sentence before this one in the paragraph, or perhaps the previous paragraph. \n\nIn the entire paragraph, we only have the sentence starting \"When he entered his boss's office\", which describes an anecdot that happened to the individual in question that relates to a business. \n\nBased on this information, the sentence \"What did the business require...\" is likely referring to all employees in a given business. \n\nSo, we are asked what specific requirement the business in question imposes on employees. But in the original instruction, the business was never mentioned.\n\nThis is because this question requires us to make assumptions to correctly answer it.\n\nThere is only a single reference to the business (\"... he didn't know how he would make his boss happy\"), and not a single concrete fact mentioned about it.\n\nSince the question is asking us exactly what requirement the business imposes on employees, but the original sentence refers to an instruction imposed on an individual, then we must conclude that the instruction was meant to refer to all business employees as well. This would logically refer to an employee's workplace as the business, which would be a given context that could be assumed for this question's answer.\n\nSince we are aware of the context, we can make assumptions that enable the question to be properly answered.\n\nWith this in mind, the answer is C: hope for peace.\n\nIn the final paragraph, there is a sentence describing what employees are required to do to satisfy their job's responsibilities, which also includes the instructions \"keep in mind customers' needs and work together.\"\n\nThis is an instruction that describes an in-store requirement, most likely referring to all employees, which answers the question.\n\nAnswer: C: hope for peace\n\n### Input What did you do at that point?

Laptop - A: The question starts with 'Which of the following  devices can you plug into....'\n   This suggests that the devices are all those that can be plugged into some gadget, and are not necessarily limited to a particular device.\n   A 'laptop' is a computer that is designed to be transported between multiple locations while being operated.\n\n2. USB Connector - C: The keyword to pay attention to here is 'USB,' which stands for Universal Serial Bus and refers to a connector and/or a standard that allows for plug-and-play.\n   Note that 'USB' could refer to both devices which are connected via USB and those that require a USB connector for operation, as well as software that utilizes USB.\n   Also note that the question refers to \"Charging.\" The device that requires charging must have a port that allows for the input of electrical energy and thereby be a charger. Devices such as keyboards, speakers and mice do not have charging ports or require additional accessories/software in order to work and thus cannot be used to charge a laptop with a USB to SD Adapter connected. Thus, option D is not applicable.\n   Bluetooth Keyboards also require additional software in order to work in conjunction with a laptop, and furthermore the keyboard requires battery or USB power in order to function.

If it was beginning in the sense mentioned for a long time, we could narrow our choices to \"to drop to zero\" or \"to heat up.\"\n2. The words \"and\" and \"the\" could refer to the things that were being described: sun and temperature, or the things that were happening: one of these was occurring, while the other \"was beginning to.\"\n3. We can narrow our choices down to \"to heat up\" and \"to drop to zero,\" as each is logically related to the sun and temperature. There is no \"dropping quickly,\" because \"was beginning,\" along with the use of the verb \"to be,\" indicates the process is taking place slowly, not that rapidly.\n4.

{"text": "#### Multiple-Choice:\nI believe the best answer is (E) Cellar. \n\n#### Explanation:\nGiven the following text, we can see that the question is asking us to find a word that means what you should avoid having if you are afraid of spiders. From the question we can see that the correct answer should not contain the word \u201cSpiders\u201d. There are two ways we can come up with a possible answer.\n\nThe first possibility is to eliminate the letters that mean spiders. (s)(p)(e)(r)(s)\nFrom here, we can see that \u201ccupboard\u201d contains the shortest version of \u201cspider\u201d in it, and therefore, \u201ccupboard\u201d is an unlikely option. As for the other part of the question, cellar should be considered because it does not contain \u201cspider\u201d at the end of it.\n\nHowever, this is just a rough solution. The more accurate solution is to consider the other part of the problem. The word \u201cspider\u201d should be found in the end. Thus, we can eliminate the option of having the word \u201cspiders\u201d in the middle of the letters. This eliminates the options \u201ccellar\u201d, \u201ccupboard\u201d and \u201cmailbox\u201d.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer and the most accurate answer would be \u201ccellar\u201d.\n\n#### Free-Form:\nI have chosen \u201ccellar\u201d as the best answer because I think it is the most accurate one.\n\nI chose \u201ccellar\u201d because its meaning includes \u201ca covered underground excavation for goods or refuse\u201d. This part of the definition can help us to avoid having spiders due to \u201ccovered up\u201d part of the sentence.\n\nThe other words are the wrong choices since spider and \u201cmailbox\u201d do not have something in common with \u201ccellar\u201d. \u201cCellar\u201d is different than all of them because it does not have spider in it.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the correct answer is \u201ccellar\u201d.", "answer": "E: cellar"}

Efficiency B: 2. Health safety C: 3. Fairness\n\n### Response\uff1a\n\nOption 2 is the only choice that requires a consideration of health safety, or, alternatively, public health concerns. This suggests that the new policy should be based upon this criterion; hence, \"2. Health safety\" is the chosen option. Option 3. Fairness is less likely to be considered necessary for the purposes of the new policy, while option 1. Efficency is likely to be the primary aspect of the new policy, as efficiency is generally the key metric for most economic policy, and does not require a consideration of any other criteria. Thus, \"1.

So the conclusion that we can get is that all answers will be wrong answers.\n\nHowever, since \"the old policy was not good,\" this also suggests that the speaker has an idea about what should replace the current policy. Hence, it is possible that the speaker would prefer some of the answers to be incorrect.\n\nSince there is a question mark with all the three answers, it is also probable that the speaker meant the statement as a way of asking for suggestions on how to make the new policy better.\nHence, the correct answer to this question is \"B\" which is \"All\". Since all the three answers, Option 1 to 3, might be correct and incorrect, the speaker might as well like all of the answers.\nAnswer: B.

{"text": "The question says that Lilly doesn\u2019t live in a heavily populated area, and the fact that she owns the only kashry deli in the area means that her business is prosperous and that she is presumably not starving or desperate for business.

One could further assume that the food court she owns is a successful business that could generate enough profit to enable her to live even more comfortably, and could allow her to be independent of any businesses that are not kashry-compliant or are not run by members of her religion. Given these factors, we can presume she lives outside of a heavily populated area since the food court she own would, if she were to buy it at all, would be a long drive away. We know this because she owns the business, but I do not believe this is important in answering the question.\n\nThe question also says that Lilly is not in Jerusalem, C, because Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.\n\nThe question further says that Lilly lives in a New York City-affiliated area but this does not mean that she is in New York City, since kashry is not an accepted practice in the city.

It is logical because if we had 4 gaseous and 4 rocky planes orbiting a star, that would mean that there are 4 planes at the same moment.\n> So, the answer could either be the star or the planet itself, but we have a strong indication that it's the star. And this is because that the object that has 4 and 4 orbits is in the same line of the clue we have to solve.\n> If we had 4 and 4 gases and 4 and 4 rocky on an object that's another, then it won't match with the same line of the instruction.

In a cemetery from more ancient eras, one could certainly find artifacts and thus make an excavation. For B, the answer is never, though one could argue that the instructions were unclear and should have been \"C: building should never be an excavation site\", but that seems unlikely, since this instruction would not follow the rules set out above.\n\nHence, the most logical answer is that the archeology site (C) is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: C: Archeological site.\n\n###", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

The given phrase alone does not provide any information that would narrow down or localize the source of purchase, so we have several possible places, including the cinema, mall, department store, or closet, where the clothing could have been purchased.\n\nHowever, what might be most logical would be to narrow down the possibilities based on the phrase \"extremely expensive,\" since the adjective \"extremely\" tends to signify something that is quite expensive.\nThe given term could, for instance, be an expensive item of clothing worn to a movie premiere that was either bought at the theatre itself or is a souvenir purchased at the movie's location and brought along for others to see. For the same reason, clothes and accessories purchased at a luxury store could be considered \"extremely expensive\" as well, especially if the item in question was unique or otherwise stood out.\nThe answer that fits the context the most would therefore be \"cinema hall,\" as the price of clothing at a movie premiere may be quite high. Aside from that, clothing bought as a souvenir at the location of a movie is commonly placed at a souvenir stores, which means that clothing may have been purchased at a mall or perhaps a department store, which is a more general, larger type of shopping center or mall.\nThese places might be called a \"mall\" or \"department store,\" respectively. Clothing in a closet is obviously an incorrect answer, and \"shop\" could mean a small stand in a mall or other type of market place.\nThe given clues do not provide sufficient information to choose between these possibilities, so there is not a unique answer, though an appropriate answer.

The word \"so\" tells us that this was her response to the problems the rug would solve \n\n###\nAnswer: D: desk\n\nExplanation: 1. We know from the context that the question asks \"which\" \"under the\" the rug will be placed. In addition we also know it is a mother who is asking the question, as this can only be understood as a mother's worry in relation to the rug. Therefore, we can assume that this is not another rugs of other types, but rather it is a carpet for a desk. In relation to this piece of information, the carpet (rug) should have been bought for under something that would be a what (where the question asks). Since we know from the question what the rug is bought for; therefore, we know what the rug belongs to and the what that follows it. Answer: B: desk", "answer": "B: table"}

If we take the difference in height of the person on the left and subtract it from the difference in height from the person on the right, how much would it equal?\n\n\"The differences\" refers to the difference between the two tallest and shortest people (\"two people\" is explicitly stated). Since there is one less person in the row on the right, it follows that the difference in height must be subtracted from the difference in height of 2 people, which is the same a difference of height. Therefore, the difference in height must equal the difference equal. \n\nThe correct answer is C: alike\n\n### Input. What are all the reasons that John decided to accept the offer?

Finally, we are given that \"man tried to run, but could not\" which strongly suggests that he was running at the beginning of the sentence and then was unable to continue when the problem occurs.\n\nSince we have that information, we know that the only way that he could be \"able to move\" by \"doing something\" is by \"walking quickly,\" or the closest option that is not a verb.

The word \"easy\" could mean \"fruitful\" or \"pleasant\" (in terms of experience), or that the task itself can be finished in a short time without much difficulty. \n    - There is _some_ evidence within the text, as someone mentions \"the last week\", indicating the current week, implying that whatever the task is, they will complete it soon.\n    - However, the word \"easy\" also doesn't necessarily mean \"simple\", and the phrase \"last week\" is vague about the nature and type of work. Considering these, the only sentence where the word \"easy' occurs is \"It is easy for me to do it in less than an hour.\" and it makes _no_ sense. \n    - This is because the sentence directly states that \"he\" (in this case, the subject himself) is able to finish the work in less than an hour, which would contradict the subject's mention of doing it in _last week_.\n2.

{"text": "We can use various strategies to answer the question. In my case I used the method of elimination:\n\n1. Exclude the choice 'A.' An oven cannot catch cold.\n2. Exclude the choice D. Oven and pizza cannot make someone look angry or disgusted.\n3. Exclude the choice B. Cooking food could result in smell, catching cold, or burnt, but it would not result in savings, which makes choice B impossible.\n4. Choice C fits the pattern. In a sense, we all know that cooking an item in the oven and not burning it will result in tasty, or in some other cases in healthy, food. Hence, choice C is the correct answer.\n### Input:What does the word on the right side of this word ladle in this picture represent? Choice: A: toast B: pancake C: steak D: sausage E: pizza F: egg\n\n### Response\nInspecting the options given, the correct choice would be A: toast. While option F: egg could also be the right one, here the question explicitly states that the right word is Ladle. This would only fit the context if the ladle held something that was toasted. Hence, the correct choice would have to be A: toast or B: pancake.\nThe picture in the question illustrates that our character is handling a ladle, which, as per the dictionary, is a serving spoon with a broad flat bowl and high sides.  However, we can look deeper and answer the question based on what is actually illustrated in the picture (which is a ladle):\n> The illustration in the picture shows the bottom of a ladle and what it is resting on: a platter filled with pancakes and toast piled high on each other.\n> Hence, our character is holding a ladle; however its bottom is resting on a platter on which pancakes are placed. So, option A: toast is the correct choice; it makes the most sense in the context based on the illustration. \n\n### Inputs: Which one of the following two statements must be true in order to answer the question?

{"text": "In this example, the instruction does not specify what question the narrative is trying to answer. Thus, we first need to rephrase the question into an answerable question that fits the instruction and topic. For instance, we might ask: \"Which of these institutions would be a good place to buy a beverage?\" While this is still quite vague, it indicates our intent to answer the question \"where to buy\" rather than \"where to get\". We could narrow it even further by asking: \"What would you get at one of these 'X'?\" It's still not exactly an answer to the original question, but at least we can parse it to the meaningful question: \"where to buy?\"\nNext, the phrase \"here\" also gives us a hint about the answer. There are only two places referenced in the sentence that \"here\" is located -- a green drink and the locker room. This rules out the stadium and gym choices, as both are places to work out and thus outside the realm of the answer, a beverage. Fitness centres provide gym memberships and exercise classes, both of which presuppose that the answer is some form of a workout -- not something to eat after a workout. This leaves us finally with the jocks and health club as choices. Neither choice is too far from the literal answer, but the context suggests something a bit more low-key and non-athletic, probably indicating a club of some sort. This leaves the option of the health club. The options in the multiple choice answer are in fact all clubs that serve beverages, but this is not a valid answer for this problem. The health club is indeed a club that offers services and membership, the most common of which is a health and wellness membership.

(to shop)\n\n###  What to do:\n\n#### Solution:\nThe first part of the problem involves determining the correct synonyms and antonyms. The antonyms are easier to determine, as we can see that the phrase \"to buy\" is reversed in the phrase \"to shop.\" Using this logic as a guide, we can deduce that the antonym to buy would be despise. We also know that the answer should be an adjective, as the phrase is \"to buy,\" implying that a noun would not make sense. Given these pieces of information, the correct antonym choice would be \"buy.\"\n\nLikewise, the first and last letters of the phrase, \"sho,\" spell the noun \"shop,\" as well, further narrowing down which synonym would fit best. The word \"impurity\" comes out as a fit, due to its opposite, \"purity,\" and its meaning, as it is not pure, indicating that the impurity must be used instead of", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

Output:He fantasied being able to get a while he was driving to work, which might have some benefits and cons of what duties and how much he would have to do. A: new car B; promotion C: boredoom D: impatience E : pressure\nRationales : The question asks about the subject, \"what?\", while \"he fantasied about getting\" clearly describes a what. The phrase \"to the what?\", clearly refers to something that the subject is able to receive as a result of the \"what?\". Finally, the last part of the question can easily be divided into two parts  :\"what duties and how much he\" suggests that the subject is fantisizing about a job or a work situation, while the \"and benefits\" portion refers to what the subject could expect to receive as an advantage or benefit. Answer : D what benefits and drawbacks?\n\nThe question asks about a what, and asks about the what, which is most likely a job or position, and wants you to know about the pros and cons associated with the what, which should be a what that you could expect some sort of \"what\" as a result of.\n\nFantasizing about getting a new car is most likely related to wanting a new car, and having been unable to attain it, or at least in the process of trying to, which would not include a specific \"job\" or \"benefit\".\n\nDriving to work while fantasizing about a promotion is also unlikely since the subject may have just been trying to reach work, not fantasize about promotion.\n\nTo conclude, the question wants to know the pros and cons related to obtaining the what, that is, a job or promotion, or related to what you might expect to accomplish because of a promotion.\n\n### Example:", "answer": "B: grocery cart"}

One solution is to use the following logical reasoning:\n- **What could happen.** The question asks \"what could happen,\" which could mean some possibilities are possible and not that they will happen.\n- **to a paper if you** The phrase \"to a paper\" clearly distinguishes between a paper and other materials, suggesting that something happens to the paper.\n- **leave it outside.** The phrase \"leave it outside\" refers to an outside, which is not restricted to a location, but can refer to nature. This is crucial in identifying the potential cause of the problem, which is the weather conditions;\n- **even if it doesn't move.** Lastly, the phrase \"if it doesn't move\" suggests that the paper does in fact move, and this movement is the cause of its rip.

The children can have their food and eat without waiting for the time when their parents come back from work.

{"text": "A bee would have to gather a lot of food in one day to maintain itself and its family, so where are these food sources found? Aside from orchards, bees can find a variety of food sources. They could go to united states, the sky, court, or the field of flowers.\n\n### Rationale:\nRoses are generally flowering from spring through the end of fall, so bees would be common in the field of flowers during that time. The apple tree would still be flowering, so there would be less pollen there than in an orchard. However, an apple tree is known for having nectar, and nectar is high in fructose which is necessary to prevent the bee from starving.  Bee colonies have been reported from sky, which is common of a pollen-bearing flower such as orchids. Bee-pollinating flowers commonly grow on trees, in court, and other open spaces around the United States, which makes it an attractive gathering place for bees.\n\nAn orchard also is a common source of food and nectar for bees. Honey comes from the nectar, which is also produced by the plant. Insecticides commonly kill bees and harm their colonies, which makes orchards more attractive, even if it is not the source of food for bees themselves.", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

{"text": "### Answer:\nThe correct answer would be \"D--hot room.\" Why this one? We can see that the word \"cool\" indicates a preference for low temperatures. Moreover, as far as one knows from the information in the question, this individual would have \"more than one electric fan,\" strongly suggesting that this person owns more than one fan. In fact, given the clues, the answer must be \"D: hot room. This choice is unambiguously correct.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The word \"if\" in the prompt suggests that this is a statement about a hypothetical situation. Given the hypothetical situation described in the prompt, the question asks about something that has never actually happened, but is likely to.\n2. The word \"likes\" indicates that some particular attribute of the situation (i.e., temperatures) is desirable in some sense.\n3. The phrase \"more than one electric Fan\" is a clear indication that the individual referred to in the prompt owns more than one Fan. Given the hypothetal situation, the question is only appropriate if the individual referred to also \"has\" electric fans. This means that the phrasing \"has\" is more suitable than \"has owned\" -- not only because the word \"owned\" infers a past-tense situation, but also because the context would never indicate that the fan ownership happened more than once--it is an ongoing possession. Hence, the choice that is most suitable would be \"has,\" as well as \"Fan.\"\n4. The word \"hot\" indicates a preference for high temperatures -- it is the antonym of \"cool\" and also the most likely direction that someone referred to in the prompt would like temperatures.\n5. As for the choice of \"hot\" we know that this person is likely to keep at least one Fan hot, as they like high temperatures. But we have no information beyond this to determine which room they have their fans in.", "answer": "A: home"}

The question says the subject may use a certain word in a sentence.

{"text": "The question is asking about where people are \"likely to stand\" at an intersection, indicating that this is behavior you would see in the population. \"Cars\" and \"city street\" both indicate traffic lanes. \"City street\" even seems to imply intersections or junctions, which indicates that people will be standing by the side of the road or by intersections. Both \"cars\" and \"city streets,\" however, are very general terms, and are somewhat broader than what is required.\n\nThis leaves two options that can be narrowed further based on the clues in the question: city street intersections/junctions and corner of street junctions. This would bring our focus to \"street corner\" and \"fork in road,\" although it's not certain which of these is narrower in meaning, both of which are narrower than what is asked for \"at an intersection.\"\n\nFinally, we have the two remaining choices: \"street corner\" seems to be the narrower of the two, and indicates that people are likely to be standing either at the four-way intersection or at an actual corner of streets. \"Fork in road\" seems to imply that people will be standing either at the three- or four-way intersection, or maybe at an otherwise isolated fork (this one is more likely a nonword). However, this choice has the more unusual implication of a different setting than expected. So, the conclusion is that the most precise answer is B: corner of street junction.\n\nAnswer: B: corners of street junctions\n\n### Input:\"That's not my problem.\" It has three times.

His strong feeling was not for specific people (like one specific gender, one specific group) he was not biased. He truly wanted peace and wanted love in the same aspect for everyone because I think he wanted it for one reason: love. I think he was strong and he had feelings.

The subject has just received a package in a thunderstorm, and we learn this from the phrase \"in the mail from a thunderstorm.\"\n\n### Hints\n\n1. We know that it was received in a thunderstoron, and one cannot expect thunderstorms to cover insurance, so Choice A is not correct.\n2. Choice B is incorrect for the same reason.\n3.

Choice E could be a correct answer except that it is impossible to have \"own\" and \"not own\" at the same time, so Choice E is eliminated.\n5.

The question specifically states that their emotions are based on their _actions_, which implies that their emotions are an immediate and involuntary response to a situation, rather than being a planned response or a result of prior actions. Hence, the answers to the question are all immediate emotions, such as surprise, embarrassment, or fear.\n\nIn this case, the question details the _specific_ actions of a person, a person \"trip[ping] in front of a crowd\" and hurting themselves in an action that is highly embarrassing. The person is embarrassed. The person is not \"tripping\" due to communication, but rather due to the action of tripping in front of a crowd. The person is not suffering or in pain, as the person is not suffering from any disease or ailment.

{"text": "1. The correct answer is C: happy. \n2. You can determine the answer choice by analyzing the clues given in this passage. \n3. Analysis:\n\n```\nThe clue in the question is \"asks a husband to stop being[sic] married to her,\" which means that the husband can be asked by his wife either to stop being married to them or to stop loving her.\n\nIn turn, the clue in the passage is \"he likely to feel even with[sic] friends,\" which means that the person in the passage can feel joy with strangers or other people that he/she is not related to.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is that the husband will feel happy with his friends, because he/she is happy with strangers.\n```\n\n\n\n#### Explanation:\n1. The clue in the question is \"(sic) married to her,\" which is an informal contraction of \"married to her,\" where the \"(sic)\" tells the reader that it is a mistake in the original text. \n   This means that the \"married to her\" was not supposed to be in italics, but simply added in through punctuation or formatting. In the original text, it would not be in italics. \n2. The clue in the passage is \"(sic) with friends,\" which is an inform that informs us that these characters/words are not capitalized in the original text. In the original text we would not see anything written in the same way (\"with friends\"). \n3. Now, we can determine that the most logical answer is C: happy, because \"even with friends\" refers to strangers, and \"husband\" refers to himself and not to other husbands that he could talk to while traveling for work. \n4. The most formal, correct answer is (sic) C, because the most common way of saying it would be \"he will be happy with his friends.\" The only part of this passage that is incorrect is the parenthetical. \n\n\n### Output:\n1.

We don't know if the class is small or a large student body. This means that what the student wants might be different to the rest of the class. So the teacher cannot make changes for everyone.

So, the teacher can change the learning process by making it interesting.\n* Support by evidence: This supports the conclusion by stating that the most common answer is an interesting learning experience. This means that this would be the best alternative as it is the most common answer. It would also be the best alternative if the person who does not like learning is the only one in the class.

The man then asks the woman, \"Where did you walk to the bank for?\" (indicating answer B is ineliminate) Then the woman says she walked to bank for the 1St (indicating answer D is incorrect).\n\n### Input D:He fantasied about getting what B:new house A: job E: bicycle \n\n### Response E. the question asks about getting what; there is only one choice that fits.  The other choices are about fantasizing about jobs, bicycles, and new houses.  We know this about the subject because the questions preceding all include how to fantasize about something.  The question does not say where in the past", "answer": "D: toy store"}

{"text": "Answer: Option B: Street corner.\n\n### Justification:\nThe best way to figure out what the instructions are asking for is to eliminate each choice in turn. First, no place mentioned is a bus stop, so if the people are indeed lined up next to a location, that location was not a bus stop. Next, we can eliminate D: fast food drivethru; although places to get food are often located near the road, this location would not serve to signal traffic through roadblocks, and would not be in a \"line\" (i.e. there is no straight line that joins each point). The same could be argued for E: City. Although cities have citizens that stand in a \"line\" or \"formation\", cities are generally much larger and more widespread than a single street corner, making it difficult to determine if \"people\" are standing in a \"line\" there.\n\n### The remaining choices are fairly logical. A: a single \"line\" of people on a bus stop is not a useful tool for regulating a road (there is probably too much disunity to cause any noticeable effect), or even the flow of people on the street itself; and B: a street corner has at very least two points in a straight line and two \"lines\" of people.

{"text": "A: washing machine\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question asks for appliances that commonly use water and soap, and the answer must be a specific type of appliance, not an abstract object or concept (e.g., a shuttle doesn't use water or soap). Moreover, the clue \"space shuttle\" is a negative answer in this context and helps to eliminate other possibilities (namely that the answer is an appliance used outside of the home).\n2. The only answer choice that could use both water and soap is the \"washing machine,\" which is a household appliance.

If such a bowl contained liquids or food ingredients, a spoon may very well be placed on the serving dish, for the purpose of placing the ingredient in the bowl or adding additional ingredient to it. A serving dish usually contains liquid ingredients or food ingredients. These ingredients may be added to or placed on a plate. If a spoon were placed on a serving dish, it would either be within a liquid or food ingredient container, or on a container such as a liquid or food ingriedent container. Therefor it may also be placed on a plate to be used for both. A spoon may be placed on a placemat to be used for food and other ingredients before being placed in the bowl, it may also be placed there before being placed on a plate.

It must be something that can be detected or seen because of the question, \"What does the word symptom mean as used by the author?\"\n2. To the right of the word symptom, the next word is \"to,\" which means that the symptom must have to do with the person who is sick.\n3. To the right of symptom the next word is \"cold,\" which means that this symptom would describe the cold.\n4. To the right of cold is the word \"feel,\" which means that the person has to feel as the symptom.\n5.

{"text": "The answer will be A: swim.\n\n### Rationales: 1) The question states that the subject is wanting to get in shape. This means that it is not a necessity to exercise and suggests that the subject can be picky on what type of exercise to do.\n2) The options do not mention the subject having any other way to get any shape or muscles. The subject has been using other alternatives such as jogging or excercising. These options imply that the subject has a form of exercise at hand. \n3) The options do not tell the subject that the subject has an alternative form of exercise. They ask the subject is there is no land nearby. This shows that the subject does not have access to land, that means that the subject is forced to look for other alternatives. The subject will be forced into exercising or into eating the same amount of calories.\n4) The answer choices that the subject can do can be done anywhere so long as there is enough space to do it. The subject also already has experience doing this kind of activity, this makes this kind of exercise easier and effective for the subject to do.\n\nHence, the subject may start swimming to maintain the shape that he was used to.\n\nAnswer: A: swim", "answer": "A: swim"}

{"text": "Answer: The clues in the sentence indicate that Lindy had multiple children, which leaves us with two possible explanations for why he lives with them: either he had been widowed and now lives with his children or he has a shared custody agreement with his ex-wife. Since the sentence mentions that Lindy lived with his children, he obviously doesn't live with his ex-wifet, meaning he most likely lost a spouse. This means that the answer must be A: republican party. The sentence does mention that Lindy did not want to live with old people, and also says that where he lived used to be a good place to live, so this indicates that the place where he lived was very different from how it is now. This can be deduced from the next sentence in the sentence: It wasn't as great as it once used to be. This all points to a likely scenario, in which Lindy's spouse passes away and he eventually moves back into their old home. However, it now becomes a retirement home, which leads him not to want to live there anymore. This means that the correct answer is A: republican party\n\n### Input : What had to have been done to get them to work more?

Option D does not actually say the problem needed to get fixed, which could be a solution of the problem. Option E says the problem needed to be corrected.

The context of the question might be interpreted to imply that one of the answer choices is a correct interpretation of the first half.\n\nSince the clues provided are so sparse and vague, I will provide both interpretations, one with what could be interpreted as the intended answer, and one with several of the other answer choices:\n\n### Interpretation 1:\nThe activity of having fun is simply being happy. The answer is A: \"being happy\", because the activity is the act of being fun.\n\n### Interpertation 2:\nThe answer could be that someone who is having fun might do any of the given activities. The correct answer is \"C: smoke\". This is because, while having fun, the activity (the word \"fun\" being a noun), could also be defined as the word \"smoking\" (as having fun often involves doing or being something, and can therefore be defined as the activity).

Choices: A:) second heart B: second heart C: human being D: human being E:) human being\n### Answer: B) Sarah opened her chest or found a second heart? \n### Rationales: The text states that \"Sarah opened her chest and...\" this leaves two meanings for \"her chest\", namely her heart and her own chest, the patient is not the one who opened his chest. Therefore, I'll eliminate A,B. \nThe text states that Sarah opened her chest, therefore, it can only mean that she is not a patient, because a patient cannot open her chest. Therefore, we are left with 2 possibilities: Sarah is not a human being or a patient. The patient is \"her patient\" or is the patient herself and thus the last option is ruled out. Therefore the correct answer is D:) human being.\n\n### Input:- A: B:\nThe text says \"he fantasised about a\" (emphasis added).\n### Demon:\nThe underlined verb \"about\" does not need an object and hence the answer does not include such an object.\n\n### The correct Answer is A:\n\n### Input\uff1aThe patient has a high chance of which?

However, the definition suggests that a patient with a heart attack can either die or get better, which is the opposite of the answer in the question.

{"text": "Master carpenters use drills to put holes in objects.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe first line starts with a question phrase \"What does a master carpentier use to put holes in object\" that is in the form of \"what\" for a reason. The phrase means a master carpenter (also known as a \"master\") needs a tool (a \"tool\") to put holes in objects (i.e., in objects). Thus, we can conclude the correct answer is \"A: drill\".\n\n### Examine this question in detail, including a description of the input and output and the methods used\n\nThe first sentence has no punctuation, and thus requires context to be determined as a question or statement, which is the most obvious method provided in the question as an example.\n\nThe key word used to mark the beginning of the question is \"What\":\n\nWhat does a master carpreter use to put holes in the material?\n\nIf this were a statement, its meaning would be similar to \"A master carpeter puts holes in material by using a drill\"\n\nWhen we analyze this question with regards to the instructions, it is immediately obvious that the correct answer to: \n\"What does a master carpeer use to put holes in material?\" must be an answer such as \"a drill\", which is in line with the instructions.

For example, \"his house\" means the \"house belonging to him\" or \"his sister house\" means \"the house that belongs to John's sister.\" However, if John says, \"his house,\" which means John's house, but if John says, \"my sister's house,\" then this means John's sister's house.

That implies that he has had a heart murmur ever since he was born (otherwise he would not have been born with it).\n- 2. The context is not really a specific part of the body (at least it is not stated that it is), therefore the words with the opposite meaning, which are feet, do not make sense.\n- 3.

The same goes for strong feet since it makes no sense in the context.\n- 5.

The fact that there is a question hidden in the question itself provides an additional clue about my future plans and possible answer choices - \"after graduation, I will have (the potential of) many future possibilities and opportunities available to me, and this question is asking about what I shall ultimately pursue.\" This helps narrow down the possible answer selection to the choices A or B.\n2. Having selected one answer choice from among A or B, we analyze the remaining answer options and eliminate those that we do not consider logical or suitable. For example, the choice C cannot be eliminated since we are thinking on a more theoretical level (that of possibilities) and have already established that our answer choices can either include a job (A for inspiration) or a degree (B for graduation). Furthermore, we can logically eliminate C as it makes little sense to assume that our answer could be \"boredom\" since boredom is not a tangible, future-oriented result of completing school, as neither \"inspiration\" nor \"graduation\" are either.\n3. Eliminating C, we may now decide on the remaining answer choice, of which we may choose one that matches most closely any relevant personal experience. We are likely to have experienced both \"boredom\" and \"graduation,\" and although there is little experience relating to \"inspiration,\" it can be said that it is possible that graduating from school could spark an inspiration to do something. For the other two answers, choosing a more specific answer may seem more realistic than choosing an answer that may potentially be too implied to be considered as a result of completing school. Hence, A: inspiration is the most realistic answer choice for the remaining choices.\n4. The final step is to check whether the", "answer": "D: graduate"}
{"text": "Answer: B: synagogue.\nBased on the context, a \"morning paper\" is referred to as \"the newspaper you get in the morning\" or something like that.\nThe answer to our problem would then be some place where newspapers are delivered early in the morning. I would reason that synagogues are also known places to study in and are places where someone would expect to find a newspaper. A classroom would be an unlikely choice because it sounds like a school. Bathrooms are out of the question. A front porch would be a nice choice unless the newspaper is dropped off on a mailbox, which I don't believe is the case. The grocery store would not be likely unless the newspaper was purchased there. The grocery could be referring to a grocery that has subscriptions to the news or something like that. Also, it is unlikely that a daily newspaper is purchased at a grocery store.\nThus, based on the context of a synagogue, synagogue is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Instructions:Complete the question below.\n\n### Rationale: The question was regarding a person's childhood. Hence, the child, his teacher, and the family name sounded like they were from the same region of the country. By inference, the family name sounded Eastern European. Thus, the only countries we can think of are \"Russia,\" \"Ukraine,\" and \"Poland.\" However, we cannot think of any Eastern European country that has a tradition of a child being named by their teacher because of how common the tradition is in England and Wales. Also, the question stated that this was an English teacher. Therefore, we are left only with two countries and no countries. Thus, our only logical choice is Ukraine.\n\nAnswer: B: Ukraine\n\n### Input:\"Let's go over to this building and then we leave with the cake and eat it together!\" Choices:  A) To the roof B) In the front entrance to the building C) Under the stairs D) In the basement\n\n### Output:A\n\n### Rationaile: In the problem, the context is that the two people are on a building tour that would be followed by some refreshments.

First of all, we can see that the subject has a deep love for all of her friends, which means she cares about them and wants to get together with them, hence what she does on Fridays is related to her friends.\n2. Next, the sentence \"she loved to host\" suggests that she likes to be in control of the events or gatherings and enjoys doing so.\n3. Additionally, the phrases \"every Friday\" and \"an open invitation\" provide additional contextual clues. They are both related to Fridays, implying that the subject's action occurs on Fridays, and that there is an emphasis on consistency, as \"every Friday\" is often used.\n4. From all these factors, the logical conclusion would be that \"She loved to host [parties or gatherings] every Friday.\"\nAnswer: F: entertain\n\n### Input:\"I need to think about this and what?\" Choices:  A:\"get back to you\" B:\"talk to you later\" C:\"do some more research\" D:\"check in later\" E:\"sleep\"\n\n### Reponse:\nLet me know when you have time to think it over.\n\n### Reason:\n1.

{"text": "This problem is quite clearly asking us if the subject is looking for a certain company. They are clearly not looking for an airport, wires, or freeway, but we don't know what it is.\nIf they are asking a store clerk or cashier, perhaps airport or wires would make sense, but it still seems way too general. The answer is definitely not A, B, or C. \n\nThe author then says, \"If they were going to the electrical company, they would be traveling in the electrical company's airplane and might have asked for permission or directions to the nearest electrical company branch\"...but why would you need to be traveling in the company's plane to know what that company is?\n\nThe author further assumes that they are talking to clerk, and goes on to say the following:\n\n\"If electrical equipment won\u2019t power on, first, a connection should be checked and then if it doesn\u2019t work, you can always call the electrical company. (Or, if you are looking for a store, you may ask information.)\"\n\nThis seems to rule out C. But how does this disqualify D?\n\nFinally the author states that what they are asking for is likely an electrical company, but goes on to discourage readers from asking store clerks as if store clerks were the only source of information on a subject.

Choices: a. in deserts b. in rain forests c. in temperate climates d. in the tropics e. at high altitudes\n\n### Rationales\nIn the first part of the answer, we determine that the main theme is biomes.\nSince palm trees are native to tropical climates, this means that cacti (the answer) is native to climates that are more temperate. The best choice for this would be option D.\nThe word \"palm\" refers to the genus of trees that have \"spiral\" leaves. The cactus is asking the question in a very non-literal way, which means it is trying to make the most logical connection between a palm tree and the word \"palm.\"\nAnother clue is the phrase \"I can't,\" which means the \"I,\" meaning the \"I,\" is unable to understand what the \"palm\" is trying to tell or say. This points us in the direction of an answer beginning with \"can't.\"\nThe rest of the wording is also somewhat difficult to understand, which suggests that the two plants are having a conversation in some foreign language (in this case, probably either English or a dialect of English with \"palm\" used in place of actual \"language\"). This suggests that one plant would know the \"language\" of the other, and the only plausible choice would be the species from which \"palm\" derives, Cactus.

The sentence does not suggest anything about the actual word we would use to call them, only that which category we use to refer to them.\nLet\u2019s start with the category that we would not refer to as \u201cthings\u201d. It is clear that the items described in the question are no longer \u201cthings\u201d by the time we are calculating their \u201cquantity\u201d (i.e. length, volume, weight). In other words, they\u2019re already been objectively measured, so referring to them in the first person seems to make no sense.\n2. This excludes A: Thing, which refers to a particular object, like cup, pen, or ruler.\n3. This seems to rule out C: Thing, when in use. In other words, we wouldn\u2019t call a cup a thing when we are using it, only when it is not in use. This excludes D: Measurement device, which would suggest we refer to the actual physical object like cups, rulers, and cubes.\n4. This rules out C: Thing. We would not speak in the first person about something that we own and are using, only when they are not in use.\n5. Finally, this excludes B: Ruler alone, as rulers are used for measuring volume and weight", "answer": "A: mouth"}

Choices:  a: The president of the United State b: An Olympic gold medalist c: A famous actor or actress d: The best writer of your generation e: An inventor\n\n### Answer:\nThe question describes the subject as wanting to do one of several things, but does not mention any context for these desires. Given this, the sentence must describe something they would simply like to be, and not some scenario where they are required to or expected to fulfil this role. Therefore, the answer is e: An inventor.\n\n### Input : What does the doctor have the patient do after her procedure is done? Choices:  She needs to make a follow-up appointment. She should take the prescribed medications. She needs to watch for any side effects.\n\n### Answer : She needs to monitor her blood pressure. She should not feel better. She needs to stay home for the remainder of the day.\n\n### Explanation : The question indicates the doctor has had someone undergo \"a procedure\" but does not clearly indicate what kind. Taking this into account and adding to the context provided, the doctor must have had the patient undergo a blood pressure test, because only this can be described by \"She needs to monitor her blood...\" in line 2. Line 4 then provides an indication that the patient will now feel better, but it is not necessary to complete that action since they have not undergone any other procedure. Finally, the sentence ends by having the patient do nothing else (\"she needs to do nothing else,\" line 5). The answer is B: She needs to monitor her Blood Pressure.\n\n###  Instruction:What did the students know about the new teacher?

Choices: A: Problem. B: Breakdown. C: Broken. D: Trouble. All of this\n### Demontration:\nAnswer:\nTrouble\n### Explanation:\nThe question asks the reader to match up two different things to the sentences that use them. The first phrase is the noun \u2018smell,\u2019 and we know from our study that a noun is more or less the \u2018thing\u2019 that is referred to in a sentence or phrase. In this sentence, it becomes obvious that the second phrase refers to problems because the person is stranded and it is a problem for them while smell could be a good or a bad thing.\n### Test:\n**The car broke down** because the engine was malfunctioning and sputtering. \n\n**He has trouble** in his exams. \n\nThe car had trouble because it had problems.  \n\nI had trouble with the dog because it didn\u2019t want to run.  \n\n### Answer:\nThe correct answer is F: Problem is the most specific or suitable answer here. \u2018Trouble\u2019 is more general a response. There are many ways to describe a problem. Problems can be small or large. The question specifically refers to a car \u201csputtering,\u201d which can only mean it is malfunctioning or broken down. \u2018Trouble\u2019 can mean many things, but it does not fit the definition of the sentence. \u2018Trouble\u2019 could describe anything from not being able to move the car to being too far away from home.\n###\n\n### Inputs: What type of water transportation _would_ be human powered?

It is reasonable to assume that John was experiencing \"pleasure\" at the time he felt entitled to experience pleasure.\n\n### After identifying that John's pleasure was connected to how he felt in reference to his swollen testicular growth, we may deduce that the answer must lie among the following.\n\nAnswer: A: pleasure\n\n### Instructions:The instructor gave the quiz yesterday asking:  In which theatres in Shakespeare\u2019s plays are the lovers in love?

If we look at the second half of the sentence, we see that there is no pronoun, which indicates we are giving the order to someone. In this case, \"the lifeguard\" is the logical candidate, as someone who is responsible and qualified to fulfill the order.\n\n### Answers: The sentence \"The lifeguard is a good swimmer\" is equivalent to \"The lifeguard fills the swimming pool\".

{"text": "He never meant to damage what he felt guilty about. He never meant to break the window of (name)'s house.\n\n### Explanation:\nJohn's guilt is related to the broken window across the street. In the context of these given pieces of information, it is unlikely for him to feel guilty regarding other possible causes for which he could have broken a window. Therefore, B, the choice that names the classroom, is out of place. The phrase \"of (name)'s\" specifies that the house belonged to someone or is some place, and the window was the part of this house he felt guilty about.\n\nChoices B and C (\"friend's house\" and \"curtains\") are incorrect for similar reasons, with choice C specifically saying that he felt guilty about the curtains of the house.\n\nChoices D and E are out of place, as John didn't mean to break what, but rather, feel guilty about what.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be: The window of my neighbor's house.", "answer": "A: friend's house"}

{"text": "A: University\nUniversities have been traditionally criticized for their poor security. This has led to several changes in university protocols, such as the implementation of metal detectors, increased surveillance of buildings, and increased security around student dormitories. Additionally, universities have also introduced various measures to improve campus safety, such as awareness campaigns on safety issues and the use of technologies to secure student identities. However, despite these efforts, universities continue to be a target for security threats, such as assaults and armed intruders.\n\n### Why Do the Responses Contain These Words?\n\nWe can see that the response contains the following words: \"highly,\" \"criticized,\" and \"security.\" These words are chosen because they are relevant to the question and directly answer the question being asked. The words also provide additional information regarding each of the five choices.\n\nFor example, the word \"highly\" is used to indicate that the security of universities has been a topic of great concern and is an area of focus for improvements. This gives us insight into how universities are addressing concerns of security and the level of importance placed on it.\n\nThe word \"criticized\" is also used to demonstrate that universities have been a point of contention over their security. This shows that there is a great deal of debate over their security and highlights the need for improvement. It is important to note that universities have been criticized for a number of reasons, such as lack of security measures and inadequate response times to incidents.\n\nThe word \u201csecurity\u201d is used to emphasize that university security is an important issue and that it has drawn criticism from many. Security issues at universities can include theft, bullying, assault, vandalism and break-ins. Additionally, universities can be targets for terrorist attacks, which can cause fear and disruption in the community. This information can help us to identify which choice is most relevant to the problem.\n\nFinally, the word \u201csecurity\u201d is also used to highlight the ongoing struggles being faced with regard to university security. While some universities may have good security measures in place, others may still be lacking in this area. This provides additional context for understanding why the question is being asked.\n\n### How to Write a Better Response?\n\nWriting a response is an important part", "answer": "E: airport"}
{"text": "Answer: B: look attractive\n\n### Instructions: \n### Rationales:\n1. \"makeup\" refers to applying cosmetics to one's face, so we can rule out answers A or E. Makeup is often applied by women as a way to increase their attractiveness or appeal, so we can eliminate C too.  \nThe remaining answers are all related to the appearance or self-image.\n2. The most plausible answer is \"look attractive,\" as this is the most likely way a person would describe their motivation for wearing makeup.\n  \nAnswer: Choice B.\n\n### Input : A man is applying lipstick, what might he be hoping his lips look like? Choices:  C: Full A: Pouty B: Smacked D: Light E: Natural\n\n### Response : \nAnswer: Choice A.\n\n### Rational's: \n1. The most likely explanation for a man wearing lipstick is for cosmetic reasons, since this is unlikely a societal norm. \n2. The answer can be inferred from the rest of the sentence: \" his lips look like\" hints that he is hoping his lips look one particular way, and the only choice which uses the same wording as this phrasing to describe lips is A.\n\nAnswer: Choice (a) \"Pouty.\"\n\n### Instruct:\nA young man has on a jacket designed to keep out the rain.

Choices: A: Clothes B: Coats C: Raincoats D: Hats E: Boots\n\n### Response  \n\nAnswer: Choices (a) clothing or (b) raincoats\n\n### Rationale \n\n1. The question asks for a type of apparel, so the best answer would either be clothing that is generally not specified or raincoats.\n2. The clothing itself could be either a jacket or coat, as both terms are often used interchangeably to describe outerwear that is designed to keep the wearer dry. Furthermore, we are not given enough context or details on the subject's apparel to definitively determine which of the answers is correct. \n\n### Additional", "answer": "B: look attractive"}
{"text": "Answer: C: race track\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question asks us to determine where a horse is \"likely to live,\" which implies that it lives somewhere. This is an object-oriented question that we can solve by examining the subject of the question (in this case, \"a horse\"). In addition, horses are a type of animal; therefore, we can narrow down the location to one that suits their lifestyle.\n2. The only answer choice that is related to horses is C: \"race track,\" as they often live around or near horse racing facilities. This is supported by the choice of \"Michigan,\" as Michigan is known for horse racing and the use of horses and donkeys for transportation. Hence, the correct choice would be C: race track.\nAnswer: C: \"Race Track\n\n### Input:- Do not park here unless you are authorized- Choose an alternate that can be done- What should you do? Choices: 1: park anyway 2: follow the signs 3: obey the signs 4: drive to your next destination 5: park elsewhere\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The problem tells us that we need to park, which rules out the choice of \"park elsewhere,\" as this implies an action other than parking. \"Park anyway\" is a vague answer, and cannot be used to answer the problem. The choice to \"follow the signs\" is incorrect, as a sign would not prohibit one from parking there, but would instead require one to follow the specific way to park. Hence, the most logical course of action would be to obey what the sign says. As the statement instructs us to \"park here unless you are authorised,\" the only correct answer would be to \"follow the signs.\"\n2. This option is incorrect, as to obey can often be taken to mean doing what the rules or authority suggests rather than an alternative. Following is another choice that would be acceptable, but not as direct and would allow for the use of other solutions. Hence, the most likely choice is one that can be inferred to be direct, and that would be \"follow the signs.\"", "answer": "D: farm yard"}
{"text": "B C: desk\n\n### Rationales: \n\n1. James is referring to his place of work in this expression. \n2.  The next expression asks where he could easily find it. We can determine that the clipboard refers to a desk because the subject (James) kept it on another, separate object that we can infer to be a desk. \n3. The expression to keep something easily refers to a place where it is easy to find or access. It is unclear whether the clipboard is always at James' desk or, if he takes it with him, he keeps it at the desk he is working at.\n\nTherefore, the answer is correct to be \"desk.\"\n\n### Instructions:\n\n\n### Demostration: Input: She said that the next time he called her, __________. Choices:  A:(his friend) B: (his wife) C: (their baby) D: (the newborn)\n\n### Response; Input:She said that the next time her husband called her, their baby. Answer; B: (his wife).\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1.The first expression in the prompt tells us that the subject of the story _______, and is followed by a phrase containing an indefinite article followed by her husband\u2019s name. The subject has already spoken earlier, and now her friend is speaking.  The fact that her friend is speaking and the fact that her friend uses an indefinite article with her husband\u2019s name, indicates that she is speaking in the near future. The timeframe of her speech is more certain than in the first sentence.  Because of this, the indefinite article is no longer required, which would point to the option B, (his wife), as being the correct answer.\n\n\n\n### Instruct: \n\n### Input;\nWhich of the following questions would it be appropriate to ask her if the reader wanted to encourage her to save for the future?\n\nChoices:  A: Do you think it's important to save for a rainy day?

In the context of the problem and in all of these answers the keys aren't mentioned in the beginning, so the answer isn't E.

Look away\n\n### Response1.A: interrupt them- It sounds like the question is asking, \"How can you get someone to pay attention to something?\"\n\n- A: \"interrupt him/her\" is not a logical answer, because it implies that there is a reason to interrupt him/her but we were specifically told to think of a logical way to get someone's attention.\n\n2.B: get their attention- This does imply that there is a reason for the person you are trying to get to pay attention, instead of directly trying to, which is why \"B\" the answer to this problem.\n\n3.C: continue reading- You cannot think that the answer is (C) because the question specifically said that you would have just finished reading the book.\n\n4.D. Take a break- You may think that you can take a break but by taking a break, you are distracting yourself from reading the book, therefore you would not take a break.\n\n5.E.

Birth charts include the birth date and birth time with birthplace information, such as in an astrological or horoscope chart.

These skills are very important as scientists need to be able to interpret data and results with accuracy to draw conclusions. Since science is a field that is always changing, constantly updating its findings and understanding of the subject matter, scientists need to be open-minded and curious about new developments and ideas.\n\nIn the end it makes sense to include both a response that is simple and not very accurate as well as a more thorough response that uses facts and information from sources to back it up.\n\nExplanation: These questions are fairly easy to answer.

The second part requires a much more thorough answer, but you can leave it more short for a simple answer and add more after you get the other one. Just my opinion. \n\n### Instruction:Write a response  to the following questions  that complies with the request.

The question is fairly straightforward, so the response should focus on providing details about the program or show without being biased in either direction.\n2. Given that it asks our opinion about the program, the response should not be excessively elaborate or provide too many details. Just enough to back up the opinion expressed.\n\n3. The sentence order can be _____ or ___. Examples and rationales are available in the teacher's guide or through a search.\n\n### Inputs: What's the longest book that you've ever read?

How is the _________ of the reader _____?\n2. _________ from _________ are required in order to understand the book and its themes.\n\n### Sources:\n- TPB\n- SAT Writing and Language Official Guide 2018\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The purpose of the instruction is to get the reader to give information about the length of the longest book they have ever read. We can use the following phrase \"How long is the ______ you have read?\" which asks the same question in a more direct form.\n2. We can ask \"__________ from what sources_______ (are required) if we want the reader to give additional information in the form of explanations or comments.\n    \n### Input: What are three things you never bring on a walk?

{"text": "The dish drainer is the place where dishes are put to dry. This term is used in both British and American English. In general, putting silverware (which this question is more likely to refer to than dishes) in the silverware drawer is a standard practice in households and restaurants (A, B). However, placing silverware in the sink to dry would be inappropriate, as this would contaminate the water, and using the sink to dry dishes is not the intended meaning of the sentence (C).\n\n### Input :What do you typically see at the end of the day and how do you want to do better the next time you see it in the morning. Choices:  a: the next day b: next week c: next month d: next year e: the past\n\n### Demostration:\nWe can't determine how this phrase specifically applies to the context without more information. The \"it\" could refer to the following: a) whatever the subject sees at the end of a day, b) the behavior that the subject was trying to change and improve on the next morning, c) the next day of the week, e.g. tomorrow, or d) the subject's self.\n\n1. To address a), the behavior in this phrase must involve a future change in the way that the subject acts as opposed to just the observation of events that have already taken place. Furthermore, if we are trying to improve the subject's actions on the next day, this would likely mean that their current behavior is not \"typically\" what they want. This indicates that the phrase \"things you typically see\" is meant to be the subject's current state.\n\n2. For option b), since the subject is asking what typically they see at the end of a normal, typical day, this is likely to be a description of their behavior, not a date. This is also backed up by the \"how can you improve\" section.\n3. The phrase \"the next time you see it\" implies that the subject is talking about seeing something in the future, not the previous day(s). This further narrows down the options to a), b), e).\n\n4. To address option c), the phrase \"the next day\" is only used in the context of a list with multiple days (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, \u2026). Thus,", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

{"text": "The answer to the question is: A: school children.\n\n### Rationale:\nIt is given that the government helps with schools, a noun describing a thing or entity. The rest of the sentence does not provide any information as to who exactly gets this help.\n\nThe first choice provided by the question, A: \"school children,\" is correct as it is the only noun that could be \"helped\" by the government, and it also seems like the most logical answer from context.\n\nSome other less likely and incorrect options include:\n - B: \"parents,\" which would involve the help coming from the government to the parents, which is incorrect as it is not a noun that is helped.\n - C: \"get money,\" which is not exactly a noun but could refer to children getting money from the government, or parents getting money from the government because of their children. However, this is ambiguous in the context of government help, and this choice of an answer is incorrect.\n - D: \"require to pay taxes,\" which could mean, in a sense, that the government is helping the children by requiring their parents (in the form of taxation on the parents) to contribute to their own education. However, this is also incorrect as it does not fit the definition of \"help.\"\n - E: \"take money,\" while correcting in the context of the government, is incorrect as it is ungrammatical English and incorrect use of \"take\" in the sense of taking money from the parents' pockets.\n\nHence, the only correct answer to the question is A: help the school children.

We can save money or win the lottery to make more money, and probably neither.\nWe could buy a house, but we don't know if anyone saves money to buy a house, and it is not a big enough change (increase) to answer the question.\nSo, we will try the third one and ask if he can \"feel safe\".\nNot quite what the question asked, but we are being logical.\nWhat is he afraid of?\nWell, not having enough money, so now we are back at making more money.

{"text": "> Answer: C: feel bumby\n>\n>\n> Explanation:\n>\n> 1. The question asks for the physical response of getting your skin squeezed between two things. \n>2. The word choice makes it pretty clear that what is being squeezed between the two things is the human body since \"skin\" means \"flesh\".\n>3. Now let's look into each possible response choice and see if any of them make sense in context.\n>\n> - Choice B feels cold: If the choice was \"cold,\" it would make sense to say that your skin would be cold. The problem with this choice is that, since cold is a relative term, without a specified temperature, it can get very confusing. I can take a cold shower, but you might find my showering environment to contain too much pressure (or none at all). We want to eliminate ambiguous interpretations from this question.\n> - Choice D itches: If your skin was being squeezed in, you'd probably find it itchy without having any physical contact with anything.\n\n### Question: Answer the following choice question.

We then consider answer choice A: \"There's no difference in personality\". It implies that someone's personality will not be different after experiencing certain events or change. This is obviously wrong since there is always a possibility of change in a person's character or way of thinking or way one looks after experiencing any change of setting.\n4.

{"text": "hot country (incorrect response) Snake\n\n### rationale:\n1. Context - The first sentence contains the statement \"He had heard of a store that would sell a what... He decided to go\", indicating that the what was a store. The second sentence contains the statement \"The storefront didn't contain what he remembered, even thought the sign said that...\", implying that there was a discrepancy, and in the third sentence the speaker remarks \"There weren't...\", implying that the what in the storefront was missing.\n2. Clues provided in problem - Contextual clues in the problem include that the what \"was a store\" and it was not something you find in a burlap sack or in pet shops. Clues about the nature of what was missing include that it is \"hot\", as the word is frequently used to describe temperature, but also \"deep\", which implies that it was something that was missing in the storefront. Finally, in addition to the clues provided by the problem, the problem also states that the \"sign said that...\", which is an indication that the what did have signage that said it was a store.\n3. Logical guess - \"hot\" is one of the answers, but it is used to describe the snake. The most likely candidate left out of the storefront was instead the hot country it came from, as \"hot\" might be an indication that it came from a hot country (which the sign would have indicated). The final clue indicates that the snake is the candidate left out of the what.\n4.

Is this a choice provided by the sender or the recipient? Who delivers the letter, a postal worker or a family member? What is the delivery method: by hand or by mail?\n* These kinds of questions are commonly referred to as rhetorical questions, questions asked for effect rather than an expectation of an answer. When there is a rhetorical question, it means that there is already context for the answer to the problem. Because each answer has multiple clues, and the context for the problem is already given, one can identify the problem easily.\n* We know that the letter is being delivered to one person because 'letters' are being delivered. Therefore we know that it must be the mail box of one person.\n* For the recipient, we know that letters to multiple people would go to the post office, so then the mail box can only be to one person, with the answer being 'C: front door.'\n* For the deliverer, we know that the letter would not be to multiple people, as if that were the case we would have to go to the post office and not to a mail box.

From this perspective, an object that can use this type of addition is a line that's not existing. This means that what could be added is a line that doesn't have an edge yet, as if it wasn't drawn before the line would be added later on.

{"text": "Answer: D: contentment\nExplanation:  In this example, the question uses the word \"can\" to indicate that the result is probabilistic, so there may be cases in which eating breakfast in bed does not make you feel content, but does not specifically address the possibility that you might feel ill after doing so, and therefore B is unlogical. Of the other choices, A, B, and C are all phrases used to describe emotions, so if it is the case that eating breakfast in bed can produce a negative emotion, then it can also produce the positive emotions listed as well, and the correct option is C: happiness. C is also eliminated due to it being an emotive choice that is not specific to the outcome of eating breakfast in bed. Further, D contains the word \"mess,\" which is the answer to a separate multiple-choice question, whereas it should be possible to have breakfast in bed without making a mess, and E: mess is ruled out for the same reason. A: vomiting is also eliminated due a lack of evidence indicating that eating breakfast in the bed will make you feel ill afterward.

Thus by being well liked the teacher has done better than by just being liked or disliked as we can see from the given statement.\n\n### Answer:\n\n**A: her popularity with the students.**\n\nAlthough popularity is related to the ability to be liked by many the response does not make it clear.\n\n**B: her popular classes.**\n\nThe teacher's classes are not just her popularity, the discipline of the students should be a factor that defines it.\n\n**C: her unpopularity with the students. (no rationales)**\n\nThis may be true and it is important to remember for this topic but this response says nothing about the problem at hand.\n\n**D: her students.**\n\nStudents are not responsible for how they behave. They are responsible for their reaction to the teachers actions as the teacher should know.\n\n**E: the new students. (no rational)**\n\nThis would only be true in as much as being well liked by the teacher is not affected by the number of students in the classes it should be constant and this is not the case as given by the text.\n\n### A:her popularity with the students\nAlthough popularity can be measured by how your students behave they are not responsible for it.\n### B:her popular classes.\nThe students are not popular nor the classes. Only the teacher is considered for this option. There are no rationales to", "answer": "D: death"}

As mentioned earlier in this guide, it is important to find common sense ideas, which the context of this question provides.\nIf a person is walking down the street with the wallet in their pocket and another person tries to extract it, they would not have to break anything, which rules out D (box). A box is a closed space that can be broken open.

{"text": "While this question does not have the specific phrase \"I wish I had\" or \"I want to be\" it can be inferred that the correct answer is A: overhead compartment.\n\nThe context of this question is about travel (the word \"bag\" is used which generally refers to baggage or luggage) and this question describes something that is a necessity at any time one travels by plane, so this question is best answered by A: overhead compartment due to its necessity at any time one flies.\n\n### Input:\"I wish I could travel, like my friend wants.\"\n\n### Response\n\nThe clues available indicate the answer must be A: travel because:\n\n- The question's subject mentions \"like\" in the sentence \"and wants\" which implies the subject is wishing or that they want to do the same thing that is desired.\n- In the third word of the sentence the subject is wishing, meaning the entire phrase is part of wish or desire.\n\nThe only answer that can make sense here is \"travel\" because the word \"travel\" could suggest adventure and travel and that is not commonly used in many other ways.\n\n### Analysis of \"I'm wondering about\"\n\nWhen a statement is made the word \"about\" is required to continue the statement. This is because in statements when you're wondering about something. You state the question and you're asking about the said question. This is also why when you're wondering a question it doesn't make sense for your question to be a question that is not about something.\n\n### Question: I'm wondering about this word...\n\n### Answer: \"Wondering\" is a verb, and the word \"this\" refers to a noun, so it is best answered with A: what it means. The word \"this\" in the question points to the subject \"wondering\" meaning the subject of the sentence is the word \"wondering\" and it's being asked what it means.\n\n### Response for \"I wish I had this...\"\n\n\"Wish\" is commonly used to refer towards someone making a statement where \"I wish\" or \"if I could\" is describing what someone wants or something they are missing.

{"text": "(answer choice)\n####Rationale:\nThis problem can be divided into two sections. In the first part, questions about diving and resulting outcomes are asked, and diving is referred to as jumping by the subject of the question.\nThen a second set of questions appear, in which we are shown a cartoon. We can connect the answer to the second set with the preceding questions.\n\nThe second set of questions contains the following phrases:\n1. \"The cartoon character dives off a cliff into a deep body of water.\"\n2. \"His body is seen making an initial upward motion, following by a downward motion.\"\nThese two phrases provide the answer to the question regarding diving ending in comedic mishaps.\n\nThe answer is, of course, \"splats.\"\n\n### Input:\"I don't know about you, but when it comes to what, I give them my all and keep on pressing.\" Choices:  A:\"my time\" B:\"my life\" C:\"my passion\" D:\"my business\" E:\"my schedule\"\n\n### Response:\"I don't Know about You, But When it Comes to my Life, I Give them My All and Keep on Pressing\"\nThe writer starts the sentence with \"You,\" and ends it with \"but me.\" This tells us that the answer to the question, \"What?\" is about someone else.\n\n\"My business\" seems to be the answer. The author doesn't make any comments about this, but in the rest of the sentence, they talk mostly about how important their own schedule is; therefore, \"my business\" is likely to be of equal importance as time.\n\n### Input\"If anyone knows what it is to be a superhero, it's him. He's the man, after all.\"\n\n### Rationale:\nThe sentence is about a person named Jack. He is the hero of the story. The key idea is that in the story Jack is a hero. The subject or protagonist is a superhero.\n\nYou might think that superhero is a proper noun because it appears at the beginning of a sentence. But it does not refer to Jack directly, even though it's a name, but describes Jack.\n\nThe phrase in the story \"He's the man,after all\" tells us that Jack", "answer": "E: splats"}

The same logic applies for the fourth option (E), as there is no time of the day that high school class will be underwater. The second and third option is wrong simply because those objects are not nouns. Lastly, the fifth option is true since there is a city on the floor. A shop will allow you to buy the city of Atlantis for your purchases.\n\n### Input : What was that sound coming from their bedroom?\n\n\n### Demosstation:\n\nThe answer will be option A because in the option A is said that they are hearing a sound that can be related to a radio.

{"text": "The question is not clear and I do not remember specifically what it said.

I would expect a \"not want\" statement to be in the past, or would expect the \"want\" statement to be in present tense, suggesting we are to assume that is desirable. \n\nWe can then consider the available choices and try to make a reasonable assumption as to what the question is.\nThe first word, \"blister\" is a very specific word related to minor skin irritations or wounds, and would seem to be an undesirable outcome of any activity.\nThe second word \"frustration\" is not a common or usual occurrence of working with wood to construct an intended object.\nThe third word \"being\" (money) is in the past tense, meaning we do not actually \"make\" money while working with wood, the implication being that working with wood would not pay well, or does not pay much.\nThe fourth choice \"make money\" appears to be written in the same tense as the word \"being\" in the previous choice. It should not be. If \"make money\" was an actual option, that would not make much sense.\nThe final choice, \"money\" is again written in the same tence as \"being\".

Option B, pay envelope, is the place of keepage in this case. Option C is incorrect as well because the envelope is where the check needs to be kept for a bank run or cash advance.  Thus, Option C, pay envelope, can not be an answer here, as an envelope has both a place of keepage and a place of disposal.\n- Option D is incorrect because the clerk does not throw away the check (the question specifies that the clerk gives it to _a person_), nor can the clerk put the check in the trash since the trash is not a specific place where a check could end up, it is just a container.

The phrase \"to bounce against\" is often used to describe a ball bouncing off of a certain object.

The boss said something to the effect of \"He aims to finish ______ by the end of the ________,\" where ______ is the month and _______ is any month.\n2. The sentence's implication is that the boss is referring to a project that the employee will finish by the end of some month (presumably this month).\n3. The question's statement of \"and the\" implies that there is something that will be affected ______ the deadline on the specific project the boss and employee are talking about.\n4. Based on points 2 and 3, the likely project is business related, since both business and home life deadlines and projects are usually scheduled for the month (most projects cannot be completed by the end of a week or of a day). It's also likely because the term \"goal\" implies something that's measurable and that people can track; this is common in a business environment (the deadline).\n\n### Input \"I'm not ready to go there,\" said the doctor, and the what? \nAnswer: B: surgery\n\n### Input :He is going to give a talk about how the what?

{"text": "The \"cat\" is a metaphor the writer may have been using to represent something else, such as perhaps a cat's usual demeanor and speech. So the question is really asking about something the writer would expect a metaphorical cat to say. As the examples in the choices provided are not typical of cats, the answer would be a metaphorical \"cat.\"\n\nAnswer: C: cat.\n\n### Input; The person next to me looked quite upset? Choices: \t A: what happened B: where from C: will happen D: nothing  E: how will\n\n### Response;\n\n### Rational:The sentence in the question is in a past active voice which is used to describe an event that happened. The second part of the question provides us with a hint \"next to me looked quite upsets\". This indicates that the person \"next to me\" is also in the past tense which makes this question \"the person next to me(Past Tense) looked quite upset (past Tense) \". This provides a clue that the speaker is not the subject of the action and hence the person next to me is used in the sense of \"the one who is next to me\". We can rule out A,C and E choices as from the second part of question we can see that nothing happen in the past tense to \"the person next to him\". Hence the only correct choice is D: nothing happened.\n\nAnswer: D: Nothing happened.\n\n### Question; I have not touched the book since Thursday. Choices:  A:- I have touch the book. B:- I have touched. C:- I touched \n\n### Question\nA: The sentence in question has two clauses in the sentence, the first clause is \"I haven't touch the book since Thursdays and the second one is \" the book\". From the clue given \" since Thursdays\" we can see that the first clause is in present perfect tense and the second clause is in present tense, as both the clauses are different in tenses and hence can't both be correct. This tells us that \"the book\" in this example is the subject of the sentence. As the clauses are in parallel and are also correct, the correct choice would be B:- I have touched the book as the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: B:", "answer": "C: meow"}

{"text": "A simple way to see that choice C is incorrect is by looking at the first sentence and the second sentence. Since the answer of choice C can't be the answer of choice 'A' (fall asleep) and vice versa. Hence, we can rule out Answer Choice C(deafness).\nFor answer Choice D(bored) as the only verb appearing in the prompt being listen is the verb listen so we rule this out as well.\nWe can then use the same logic to rule out answers E(Calm) because the only verb appearing in choice C being listen means nothing about being calm from the listener.\nSince there is only one sentence provided in the choices the choice can also not be answered with \"the person does not seem interested in listen to music\". So this leaves us with two options, answer Choice A(fall asleep) and answer Choice B(relaxation).\nAn easy way to see whether option A(falling asleep) fits in the prompt is the fact that the person is not listening to music. We can rule out the answer A(falling assleep) because the person is not listening.\nAnd as we can see the answer option B fits in nicely within the prompt. Hence, our answer that best fits the prompt is answer choice B.\nAnswer: B.\n\n### Input 2:\n\nYou are given the following information:\n\n### Input\n\nA friend of mine had one of his worst birthdays ever.\n\n### Rationale\nFrom the above input, we know that the birthday was bad because of his/her friends.

Choices: A: Foot loose B: sea sick C: fast D: Sailing E: Binding\n\n###### Rationales:\n1. The Words wheel loose: These words hinted that the subject (the wheel) has been loose before,  indicating that there's been a series of events happened. The \"threaten to fall off\" shows that there's a huge possibility that the wheel might fall off soon. 2. The words \"are sailing \" or \"are sea sick\": these words indicated that the subject \"are sailing or sea sick\"(is referring to their condition \"Wheel is being loose\") suggests that the subject \"being lost in a long sail\" is unavoidable. However, it is not \"being tight\", because \"being tight\" would be the opposite of being sea sick.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### 3. Taking into viewpoint of the rationales, the most most appropriate choice for \"being what\" would be \"footloose\", that means the subject (the wheel's loose state) is a new state of affairs and is no longer stable, suggesting that there's a possibility for the subject of the sentence to fall off soon.\n\n### 4.

{"text": "Answer A. _Workplace_ may also be a place to meet a friend who does not really live close to you, but it is more common to meet friends at places where they work or study. As for the rest of the options, I see less sense in them for this purpose. Neighbor's house is the only one where you can be sure the other person will be, but it has to be someone's house. Other locations are not controlled by any specific person. You may meet a friend in a bus station or on a train, but it is a temporary and unpredictable location, and you may end up talking on the street or in a cafe. Besides, if this is a friend, both of you are probably adults with jobs and a bus station is no place for them to be. (I suppose it is more likely to meet a friend who goes to a school than a person who just studies, but still). At school, when people are not studying, they are probably also not in a hurry to meet someone. So I think your friend is more likely to be at school, but I prefer to say at work because this person is certainly adult and definitely does not have a job at the school.\n\n### Input Where do the police often meet? Choices: A: courtroom B: police station C: court D: supermarket\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer E is correct. Usually, when you think of police, the place you want to think of is their station. There are many police stations in a city. They need to make a lot of arrests. A court is the place for a trial. You can also find courts at police stations. After making an arrest, a policeman may take a defendant to a court. He or she may also make it to the police station to be tried. A police station is also close to the neighborhood where it operates and where many of the people who are going to be arrested will live, work, and visit. If a criminal wants to escape the police, there are several places to hide: restaurants, parks, shopping centers. But if a policeman makes an arrest, he may go to the police station and tell them he caught the one he wanted. So a police station is the right place for a policeman to meet a criminal, and vice versa. A courtroom might be used for this, but I think a supermarket is something you will", "answer": "D: neighbor's house"}

We can see this even more clearly when we separate into two clauses.\n* \"only some\" indicates that these police do this task only some of the time, but not all of it.

This is consistent with our earlier supposition that the question is asking for a place the speaker intends to buy food items.\n    - The question does not directly imply that we must look for food items to eat out of the house, so it does not clearly rule out purchasing food items indoors or for an indoor setting. Thus, it does not rule out buying food that one would cook or eat at home.\n    - The phrase \"\u2026but not eat it at tables\u2026\" then is a constraint on the place that the speaker is seeking, that is, for which the speaker would not be eating food at tables.\n    - Again considering the context, the speaker is most likely not talking about buying food items that they will be eating out of the house: they will definitely be eating that food at a table.\n    - Additionally, food prepared at home and eaten at a table is a normal occurrence, and is not an unusual occurrence. Since our goal is to search for the most normal, typical, frequent choice in this situation, the correct answer would be \"home.\" So as not to be too redundant (see what we did there?), the answer will be C: home.\n\nAnswer: C: home\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Since the question does not clearly answer the question, it could mean many things. We can eliminate some and narrow our options down.\n2. This is a context clue; not only does our speaker not intend to eat the food at a table, they also want to eat it at home.\n\n### Input\nEat or be eaten; and he replied \"That's better than I think.\" Choices:  A. eat B. be eaten C. nothing D. you bet", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}

{"text": "The correct answer is \"A:body armor.\"\n\n### Rationale:\nFrom the question of what James shot at, the answer can be inferred by referring to the word \"it.\" It is not clear what exactly James shot at and what \"it\" stands for, but the question says he used a cannon, which is a big piece of weaponry, so the \"it\" probably stands for an area or place, like an office, a house, or a store.\n\nSince he used the cannon, we can infer that he may be aiming to do an action that may hurt or damage someone there or damage something. This excludes choices \"A: body armor\" and \"C: Animal.\" Body armor would not get damaged by the cannon, and since we are looking at damage and harm, it may be unlikely that an animal like a dog or a cat could be harmed by shooting a cannonball.\n\nThis leaves us with just \"B:ungulate\" and \"D:kill people.\" \"B\" does not say exactly what was being shot at, so we can eliminate that choice. However, the word \"kill\" in \"D\" suggests that he's shooting at individuals, so it doesn't seem likely that he's shooting people. Also, he's not shooting at a large group of people, so he's likely only shooting at one person.\n\nWe can deduce that he's shooting or aiming to shoot someone with a cannon. We need to know exactly what he shot at, so we must refer to clue \"James.\" The phrase \"while seeking lunch\" implies that we should infer what he is likely to be looking for. If he's aiming to harm or damage someone, it makes sense that he is looking for a target, and the most probable target that he is looking for is \"something else\" or what we call \"lunch.\" Thus, the most likely choice would be \"A\" or \"A:body armour.\"", "answer": "B: ungulate"}

Choices:  A. A: station B. B: every car and home C. C: shop D. D: bedroom E. E: space shuttles\n\n### Demostration:\nThis instruction, like the previous, is asking me to understand the given information based on what I know about the subject and the situation. Both instructions, together, give me a complete understanding and can be seen as a single problem where the second instruction provides useful context for the first.\n\nMy analysis starts with the subject - \"a person.\" This is a general, somewhat vague subject, and suggests that we are not dealing with a unique individual, but a group or type of people. This helps me understand that we are looking at a subject's common fantasies and their desire to fill those fantasies. I can also reasonably assume that the subject's desire to buy \"a radio\" is based on the first instruction and that it is likely for the subject to go to car and home, as the question asks.\n\nThere are several common radio-listening scenarios we could consider. Since this question is asking us to describe \"a person\" that wants to \"have a radio\" in their car and house, we could consider common situations where people listen to radio (car rides, commutes, the home). For the subject, that could be where they do their fantasizing and where they are most likely to \"go,\" like to a store to buy a radio. This is also indicated by the answers in the space shuttle, where the subject is \"away from home\" and \"away from work.\" It seems safe to assume that this is a common scenario, but we could also consider a more uncommon scenario.\n\n### Answer:\n**B**, shop. The subject wants a radio to listen to music, and that is best achieved by heading to a store, since there is little chance they would \"", "answer": "C: shop"}

{"text": "The question gives us two choices:\n1. A: lying in\n2. B: moving away from\n\nThere can be no movement into a puddle, due to the question specifying that the answer is \"ends up stopping.\" Lying in is not a valid answer, as standing is a state of being, and not lying in.\n\n### Rationales\n\nThe first sentence of the question says that the subject is \"standing... in a puddle\", so it is clear that an option to \"move into the puddle\" is invalid.\n\n### Reasoning\nThe question gives us an image of someone standing in a puddly or wet area, so there is a good chance that they are wet in some capacity. When people are wet and standing, they want to get out of the wetness, so if their answer is to \"end up stopping,\" i.e. standing, they are clearly not leaving the wet environment that they are in. The only way to end up stopping in a wet environment would be if they lay down and stop moving in said environment. Hence the most logical option is clearly \"B: moving away from,\" as the other options are clearly invalid.\n\n## Rationale #2\n\n### Demorstration:\nInput from a friend: I do not understand how your answer was 5  and not 7: you are correct, but your reasoning is not rational based on the context.

Therefore, this rationale will explain the logic.\n\n#### R1\n\nAnother rationale for the answer could be how people generally tend to get a little bit older every year by one year based on the birth date and age of the baby. Therefore, the year they are currently in will tend to be more than one but the previous year will be one. Therefore, the child is 5.\n\n#### R2\n\nThis rationale is a logical reasoning for why the answer,", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

The answer is not \"dictionary\" because we know what a dictionary is and we have to use our knowledge to arrive at the next best answer. If the marmoset used a dictionary, the answer will be \"underground\" because most dictionaries are found underground.\n\n\"Fly\" is not correct because you wouldn't expect a marmoset in the sky.

Please edit and provide a solution to the Task 1 below, using only what you know from this session.\n\n### Task:\n\nPlease explain the key differences and similarities between the given processes.\n\n### Process A.\n\nA method that does not allow parallelization, using all the CPUs as one single node, does not scale well for this kind of problem.\n\nBecause of that, a parallel computing system like MapReduce is applied so the amount of processing per step is small enough to spread over multiple nodes.\n\nThere are different parallelization techniques and the one applied for this problem is called \"data parallelism\" (or \"n-way parallelization\"). The input is split into smaller portions, or \u201cchunks.\u201d Each \u201cchunk\u201d is processed by different mappers.\n\nBecause the processing for each \u201cchunk\u201d is the same, we say the algorithm is data-parallel.\n\n###ProcessB\n1. The parallelization technique used in process B is \"model parallelism and work-item parallelism.\" This implies splitting input data into different models, and the work item is the processing unit of each model. Instead of splitting the input data into chunks like in process A, the input is first split into batches of processing units and then each model is computed on its own batch using \u201cmodel parallelism.\u201d These batches are called \u201cwork-items\u201d and this explains the term \u201cwork-item parallelism.\u201d\n\n2. It is a different approach than process A, as they both have parallelization and sequential computation. While process A makes a single model work on each \u201cchunk,\u201d which is the data parallel approach, process B works on different parts of the input data (batches of \"work-items\").\n\n###ProcessC\nProcessC is just a version of the second process (A or B) with additional steps.\n\n\n###Output\nHere is the solution from task 1 with a little correction. It should be:\n\n###Process B: Instead of splitting input data into different batches, it breaks input data into batches to each worker; process all input data from a single worker before moving to the next.\n\n## 17-25/06/2", "answer": "C: spinning wheel"}

{"text": "When you meet someone, particularly a stranger, it is the norm in our culture to be polite and friendly. If the real estate agent is very polite, that in and of itself is not a trust building action. Being polite is about keeping the social status quo. It is a non-offensive and non-threatening approach that lets the other person know that you aren\u2019t going to hurt or damage him or her in any way.\n\nAsk yourself two questions.\n - Does the real estate agent have knowledge and skills to do the job?\n - Is the agent being truthful and honest?\n\nWhen you ask yourself these questions you will know whether the real estate agent is competent. You will also have a more thorough idea of whether you can trust them. And if she is a knowledgeable, competent agent, the next question is why does she have to play a game of \u201cto gain her trust\u201d in order to sell real estate.\n\nSo by what are you, the reader, meant to gains trust that the real estate agent will do a good job? Why should the agent have to do something in order to have trust? If the client trusts and believes in the agent\u2019s competence, the agent will be trusted whether or not she has to work hard to gain trust.\n\nReal estate is a sales process, therefore, sales techniques and sales tactics are used. Salespeople have a set of techniques and tactics that they use to make sales. Real estate sales can sometimes be a manipulative, deceitful business. A competent real estate agent doesn\u2019t have to use these techniques and tactics in order to make successful sales.\n\nGaining trust is an illusion - trust is not built in a day. Trust is built over time, by experience. When you\u2019re trusted as an agent, your reputation should bring repeat clients. You don\u2019t have to gain your clients\u2019 trust; it is there once a client enters into an agreement and begins the process of selling their home or buying another.\nOnce you have established a client relationship, then you can begin to build trust so that when you share new ideas and information with your client, the client is willing to accept what you tell them.\n\nIf you are a real estate agent, the best way you can gain trust quickly is to share honest and truthful information and give realistic expectations about the market, and", "answer": "B: charming"}

{"text": "In this problem, we can use the context of the problem combined with common knowledge to analyze the answer.\n\n1. \"my\" is the most likely indicator that we are referring to this person's own property or dwelling, rather than a more general or unrelated entity.\n2. Living is something one does in a building, such as a house or apartment. So the most logical choice is that the building is a house.\n3. The word building has broad connotations that include both literal constructions like houses and more abstract ones like corporate headquarters. Therefore, we can cross this word of our list as not being too specific, and should instead look at words that tend to have more specific meanings: conference, garage, mouth, and some more unintuitive choices like demonstration. \n4. \"lived\" is in the past tense (\"lived in\"/\"lived at\"), which is rarely used to describe a person's current or near-future location. For most people, this is a reference to something from the past, which points towards either a house or garage.\n5. We can therefore cross off choices A and B, as well as C and D.\n6. The word \"mouth\" is probably not referencing an actual mouth but instead has something to do with a home's primary entrance, which points us towards a house.\n7. Finally, we can cross off choice E as being too far-fetched, and therefore the correct choice is B: house.\n\nAnswer: B: house\n\n### Input:\"We like living in such an attractive place.\" Choices: A: city B: neighborhood C: forest D: state E: suburb\n\n### Response:\"We\" suggest that we are speaking about a place that is likely to be attractive to an individual or individuals. Because we are speaking of one place, the choice E: suburb, seems unlikely. We can therefore rule it out.\n\n1. This leaves the choices of A, B, C, and D. We know that it is attractive to the individual or individuals, which means it cannot be city or state. This eliminates both A and D from consideration.\n2. Suburb is a type of neighborhood, but neighborhoods in cities tend to be smaller than those in suburbs. Because of this, in most cases a suburb is smaller than a city.

The first clue we have is that the subject is going to the movies. The sentence tells us that it is in the suburbs of the city, and we can assume this to mean a small town somewhere that is not close to a city center or downtown. If it was downtown they would have said the downtown area.2. The subject is looking to meet their friend before or after the movie.3. The subject says that the movie is at a theater in the suburbs (not downtown).4. \"The theater parking lot\" and \"The theater lobby\" are two choices of places to meet, though not very likely. This leaves three choices still possible: the theater itself, the mall, or the parking lot of the mall. However, the instructions have already eliminated the mall because they would have used \"The parking lot at the mall\" if this was intended.5. The instructions have also eliminated the theater itself because we know the movie is at a different theater in a different suburb. This then leaves us with two choices: the parking lot at the movie theatre or the parking lot at a mall.\n6. We are looking for a place that is close enough to the city that the subject would not prefer to the mall", "answer": "E: present bill"}

{"text": "This question contains two elements to the prompt. First is the subject and then follows a sentence on where they go, giving me a hint on how they fly from place to place. Here we have two types of geese. These two clues give me a total two options. I can either say they travel by car or fly. The two options that I have are flying or travel by car. Since the context of this question tells me that I can eliminate travel by car since the first line of the problem stated they fly not travel by car. Since we know that they fly I need to understand how they fly? This is where they keyword fly comes into place as their primary method of travel. With the geese I am given an option on how they fly or guard house which are the options A,B,C,D, and E. So what I have learned so far tells me that we are dealing with four options. The next step is to eliminate the obvious answer. The obvious answer with this question is if you are familiar with geese you know that they don't travel with an ultralight airplanes. Next we have fly, which tells me that with this question I know that they don' t travel by car. And finally we have the last option which is the group together. This is where we see the final answer to this question. So we go down our process and look for the method of travel. And with our four options we learn that the two options that travel together are B and C.

So I'll go into detail about how do I differentiate between the two categories.\n\nI'm going to start by listing what kind of things/factors John would consider to make one thing a \"winner\" and another a \"loser.\" First, John's preferences will come into play, so I can start by listing some preferences for \"winners\" and \"losers.\"\n\nSecondly, is that John doesn't care about who he plays with, he's \"just\" concerned about competing as long as he wins.

This narrows our answer choices quite bit:\n1. Happiness is a strong motivator and certainly would cause a person to buy presents, but it is not a \"thing\" one may find themselves lacking on a matter of principle.\n2. Lack of money: it is possible to lack money and not buy presents. However, if someone wants to buy presents but something like lack of money prevents them, it is unlikely that the reason for their wish to buy presents is money.\n3. Stress, impatience, or relief: these have to do with emotional states, which are more of a psychological rather than a motivational concept. In addition, again, the reason a person wants to buy presents but can't would have to be related to a matter of principle or to beliefs.\n4. Exhilaration: this is a state of emotion or exhiliration, that is, feeling happy and excited. In the scenario of this question, the problem is not how one feels when looking at Christmas presents but that one cannot go purchase them, which suggests that the reason for that is a belief which says one cannot purchase Christmas presents.\n5.

Based on the clues, we know the exam is probably an academic one.

Choices:  a: country side b: dairy farm c: butcher shop d: canada E : none of them\n\n### Response :\nIn this, there are a lot of different answer choices which are all plausible and are all somewhat logical options, given what is stated in the question. It might be useful to see the question as two separate parts: the first part (where Simon bought a cow because...) is a very general sentence that offers contextual clues for the second part (but doesn't actually specify what the context is).\n\nFirst, we have the question of what, exactly, the cow is being put to work with. It was bought to work, so it shouldn't just be grazing or being a pet or having its life as an end in itself. Rather, it is \"put to work\" for something.\n\nIn the second part of the question, we have the clue of Simon not wanting any meat from the cow, but there is no real information as to what this is in relation to. If the question had been phrased 'Simon bought a cow to put to work and didn't want it for meat. Where is Simon going to keep the cow?', we have clarification about what the meat might be going for (butcher shop) and we also have an added incentive and additional motivation for Simon to keep the cow in the dairy farm.\n\nFinally, we could see this question as stating what Simon didn't want, but not what he did want. This would indicate that his motive for acquiring the cow may lie in some kind of non-meat use.

Unless this building contains a bar, this isn\u2019t what is meant in the question.\n- If we are referring to bottles of medication the first thing to note is that there is no medication involved in the example in the question and that the building\u2019s contents would be incompatible with most medications; therefore, it makes no sense to refer to a building as a \u201cbottle of medicine,\u201d regardless of what kind.\n- The phrase \u201cbottles of water\u201d is commonly used to describe the drink bottles a person is carrying. The building is neither a student taking water bottles to school nor a worker who brings bottles of water back from a job site. The context of the question clearly indicates that we are not dealing with bottles of water.\n- Like \u201cmedicine bottles\u201d and \u201cbottles of drinks, \u201cbottles of perfume\u201d is also not relevant, as we are clearly not dealing with perfume, only glue bottles.\n- Similarly, \u201cbottles used to sell or store foods,\u201d or \u201cbottles used in cooking\u201d are not at all related to the question. The concept of cooking can be narrowed down to \u201cin a kitchen or kitchen area\u201d and is irrelevant to the context of the question.\n- Likewise, we could be talking about bottles for fire in a firehouse; however,the context suggests a school or college, and there is no indication here that the building is used for fire protection or as a residence.\n- The phrase \"a bottle of something\" is", "answer": "E: school"}

The key to the answer is \"did everything\", so the action in this statement must have been one that could be done in every sense (without an option to \"do\", which limits the choice).\n2. The context of the question then is that of studying and homework, so any action or statement in this regard would fit.\n3. The second part of the question mentions that the speaker wanted to do something else, this suggests that whatever they did was not what they wished to do but what they ended up doing despite their intention to do something else instead.\n4. We can therefore logically eliminate choices A and C as there are \"I\" and \"wash\" in these choices, which seem too specific for general use as opposed to what could be done in every case (without the \"what\"). \n5. Choices B and E are also too specific in their phrasing; they can be considered as eliminations, although they may not fit in the context exactly they could also be potential choices.\n6. The context also indicates that the act involved in the question is going to involve some type of work, so something that requires less effort is likely, and so choice D is eliminated.\n7.

Choices: 1) The environment will be more supportive now 2) They will be better at managing their time 3) They will feel more comfortable with the change 4) It will be less demanding 5) They will be in control Question 2\n\n### Rationales: 1) The first sentence gives us an idea of the type of change involved. A person is being \"promoted\" to a higher level, suggesting a \"new\" or \"different\" job.\n2) \"Stress management\" is a phrase or keyword we often hear in job-related situations. This indicates that the subject is most likely to have experienced stress or uneasiness in their previous work position.\n3) The sentence in which the job change is mentioned, \"reducing stress associated with the new job\" provides more clues about the context. These two sentences tell us that (a) the change was stressful enough for the subject to consider changing the job, (b) the subject experienced stress or uneasyness related to work.\n4) In the given sentence, we can see that the main character is contemplating the pros and cons of a new job, thus we can assume that they have made it to the higher level, so stress management probably becomes important for them. Also, we see that they are looking for the \"less demanding\" part of the change, supporting the answer C, relaxation.\n\n\n### Input:-Why is the subject looking for the less demanding part of the change to the new job?-Can you think of any reasons why stress management might be challenging?\n\n### Rationale:  -In the sentence \"The subject is looking for the less demand stress\", we can easily see that it is the new change or position that becomes less demanding for the subject due to new experiences, skills and knowledge.\n-It probably becomes hard to relax or manage the stress, as the person is overwhelmed by all the new and probably, unknown responsibilities and expectations that the change brings.\n### Instructions:Choose the best answer to this question.\n\n## Input:-Why is the situation less stressful for the new executive?\n\n### Options:-They are doing much the same work in their new job.\n### Options", "answer": "A: good health"}

Bullets are small and usually fired quickly in huge amounts. Also, most bullets are metal, indicating the object referred to in the question is metal.\n\nThe \"bullet\" referred to in the question could have been fired by:\n    - A machine gun, which, as a weapon, is most likely to fire bullets.\n    - A canon, which, to our knowledge, does not shoot bullets but is generally made of metal.\n\nTaking into account the context, \"bullets\" in the question indicate projectiles.\nThus, taking into account the fact that most war cannons were made of metal but not all bullets were, the most logical answer is: C: weapon.\n\nAnswer: C: weapon", "answer": "A: battle field"}

You couldn't put your coffee beans in the ocean and you probably wouldn't put them in the chair! You could put them in a big box.

Given that they are driving, the question must be asking a question that a pilot would ask to figure out the meaning of a point on the map. The choice \"Asia\" is not a good answer because it does not look like a sea that was named after a location on the map in the original question. However, the other answers are all countries, which means that the planet of Earth or a group of people called the \"Indians\" might have found the Indian Ocean. The next best answer is then \"Southern Hemisphere,\" because this is the only name of a planet that is not human in origin. The other answers make sense but are not answers to the question: \"Where would a Martian need to go to find the Indian Ocean?\".

{"text": "A: idle time\n### Justification:\nThis question has some elements in common with the previous question that dealt with what you would be fantasizing about. It also, like the previous question, starts with a phrase stating that whatever the answer is, it probably doesnt involve or entail. \n\nIn this case, the phrase is \"If you are fidding through a music book when [...] you probably don't have?\" which could be interpreted a couple of different ways. \n\nFirst, without context, this suggests the subject in question has probably never played through a music book, implying lack of practice. \n\nA different way to interpret it is by removing \"fidding\" and examining whether there are consequences or possible causes of \"fidding through a music that you probably don't know\". \n\nIf the subject were fiddling through the book, it would suggest they were lacking the dexterity, or the skill to play and be able to flawlessly handle a music book. \n\nHowever, neither one of the answers provided satisfy the second requirement as both, A and B, can be true and false regarding idle time, dexterity, music knowledge etc. The question is not satisfied as none of them are able to provide us with a reasonable response.\n\nThe phrase \"you probably don't have\", however, is something that needs to be kept in mind. Idleness will cause idle time, which is the answer we want. \n\nSo, if you start playing, you will probably lose your idle time, and your dexterity with the book as well.

I would guess that we would have to look in the dictionary aisle (that would be the area where the word dictionary is present; not the area for books on education or books for children). It would be more logically sound if we looked under the aisle heading for dictionary versus the books on education. Hence, B can be disregarded.\n\n- If we decided to look at C, it would be more logical to look in the table area. There are many areas in a classroom for books to be placed, but it seems more logical to place the dictionary on a table. The first question would obviously be: What would we take with us to a table? A table would not be an efficient place for a dictionary, as it is portable, so we will need to take the dictionary with us to a table.

Firstly, we've got an embedded question in our response, where the answer is a \"will\" statement. One way to deal with this would be to use a complete subject (He). However, using \"will\" as an auxiliary verb makes the sentence sounds more natural. Secondly, we have a missing subordinating conjunction after \"will,\" that is not supplied by the author of this problem. In this case, since we have a question/answer relationship in the input, we could be more natural by choosing an answer in the form of a question. This would require an appropriate verb with the missing conjunction, so \"shouted they would have fun\" does the trick.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### Input 2:\nThe police chief ordered his officers to come to the station and do what tonight at 8 PM? Choices: \t  A: give speeches B: run surveys C: take the exam D: go out E: clean the station \n\nRationales:\n1. The input describes police officers coming to the station at 8 PM, so we know that whatever they are doing has to occur later.\n2.

The student might think about the subject they are supposed to write down or draw a picture of, or about the teacher or classmates, or about school itself, its rules, and so on. Therefore, there would be a mixture of thoughts, but most likely some school-related ones would pop into a student's mind when they can't concentrate.

The subject in the first question mentioned in this answer is a person driving a car.

{"text": "Answer: D: headaches\n\n### Rationales:\n1. This question states that the subject \"hurt all over,\" which implies both physical and emotional pain. While addiction can also have a physical component, the statement that \"he hadn't gotten [what he needed] in a long time\" does not imply a long term, continuous situation. This suggests a more recent event, and a more recent event suggests something that happened recently over a long period of time. Addiction is a chronic disease and so is unlikely to develop over so few hours.\n2. The next sentence, \"He was tired, he was [shaking,] and he was in pain\" clearly refers to the state he was in before he got what he needed. \"Was\" suggests the actions happened in the past, while \"tired\" clearly refers to fatigue.\n3. \"He hadn't gotten...\" and \"he was in pain\" could also refer to an injury, like a headache. While this is possible, the final sentence states that David had not gotten what he needed \"in a long time.\" This would imply that he had gotten some help before. \"Over eating\" is therefore also excluded.\n4. In summary, the most likely possibility here is the \"over eating\" David was likely to have gained from a meal, rather than an eating disorder, leading to headaches. Therefore, the correct answer is D: headaches, which can be obtained from the question stem and subsequent context of information.\n\n\n### Input:\"She is being treated poorly at work because she is getting older,\" answered a colleague.

The sentence is unclear, and therefore we can neither answer B: men, since it is unclear what \"two went home together\" refers to, nor E: none of the answers, since it is unclear if the words are referring to one or both of the men. The question is grammatically correct, so \"you are what you did\" would be the correct answer had something been omitted from the sentence. As indicated by the \"and\" in the sentence, there is indeed something more to the sentence, so the question should read \"You are what you did. And?\" \n\"A: man\" is the only answer that fits, since it is the only correct answer that makes sense in the sentence. \"B: both\" would contradict the original sentence, as would \"C: both angry and annoyed.\"\n\nAnswer: A : man\n\n### Input\"Do you know what I did last night?\" A: Yes B: No C: I don't know D: I know E: I'm not sure\n\n### ResponseI'm not sure:  The sentence is ambiguous, suggesting the asker did several different things at the night he is asking about.

{"text": "(answers in same order)\n\nI)\n\nThe first hint given in the problem is that the billionaire donated a sum to his former college. Because we do not know what he donated it to, our analysis should remain broad and non-specific. The answer to this question is likely to be something uncommon at a business school, but not specific to only one industry, like finance or technology. Thus, we can discount choices \"B\" (bank), \"C\" (big town), \"D\" (big city), and \"E\" (building).\n\nII)\n\nA second hint is given in the problem in the sentence, \"this allowed them to construct a... building,\" suggesting that whatever is being constructed in the same sentence is what is being financed.\n\nThis allows us to eliminate choice \"A\" (fraternity house), which does not directly relate to the work or business world. Eliminating this gives us choices:\nC: big town,\nD: big city,\nand E: building.\n\nIII)\n\nEmerging from the context, we can then analyze each of the remaining choices more closely. Choice \"D\" seems to be the correct choice because (1) \"big\" usually refers to \"broad\" or \"large\" or \"large amount,\" indicating that the science building in question is large, and (2) given that the building will be constructed with donations from the billionaire, \"big\" may be a euphemism for \"large\" or \"donated.\" It makes sense that someone wealthy enough to donate a billion dollars can construct something large.\n\nAnswer: C: big town\n\n### Input:[1] You can make it  back up before it finish this  you can make   this faster if this you  make this as a sub question you can  make this not so big if this you  make  some one can   make this   for me\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question by submitting the correct response.\n\n### Input([2]): 1.  \n### Instruction:[1] You can do this because a)this 2.  \n### Input ([3][4]): you can do this because this? 3.  \n### Demonstraition([1]): 1.

Choices: 1. A: drug manufacturer B: drug distributors C: health care providers D: pharmacies E: federal government\n\n### Rationales\nFrom the context, we can infer that the FDA is trying to do something about the issue of drugs with harmful ingredients causing a health risk for the consumers. This is one of their core responsibilities, and the statement made indicates that it is no longer working well. The term \"role\" can signify the actor performing this task, thus implying that the person is an agency or institution. This points to the federal government, as one way the government ensures the safety of its people is by performing duties related to their health. Therefore, the correct answer is E: federal government.\n\n### Other Options\nA: drug manufacturer. Drug manufacturers are responsible for checking their products for safety, but not the general public. Even if the drugs are harmful and there is an advisory, it is not the responsibility of a drug manufacturer to distribute this information.\n\nB: drug distributors. Drug distributors are responsible for making sure there are enough prescription drugs to go around, however, FDA advisories are about drugs that are unsafe for consumption by the general public and not about drugs that might lack sufficient stock.\n\nC: health care providers.

They keep feeling sad for it and they feel sadness that keeps on going. But they can't hurt themselves because they're stopping themself.

Choices: 1. 1 He fantasied about a what to ease his fear of a wolf attack Choices:  B: new car C: job promotion D: boredom E: friends A: a nightmare B: something ordinary C: nothing D: impatience E. pressure\n\n### Rationales:\nBased on multiple readings and a lot of research: The story of the boy who cried wolf is a story of someone who doesn't take threats seriously and thus overreacts to imagined ones. The phrase \"He fantasized about getting a what to ease his anxieties\" implies that this was what he imagined to be a real wolf's presence and thus is referring to a scenario in which he overacts. It also uses the word \"to ease\", indicating that the threat was not particularly frightening or threatening and was rather imaginary.\n\nThe sentence then further narrows the scenario by saying that this imaginary wolf attack might be something akin to boredom. This tells us that, based on these narrative context and the phrase used, the correct answer is: E. Boredom\n\n#### Input: The last time I felt that nervous was when I was about to do a presentation for the first time.

How could she know that the horse was hers?\"\n\n### Demand:\nIn order to figure out how the girl can know that the horse is hers, we need to consider that the girl said that she wanted a pony. The author mentioned that the horse was the best one of its kind. In the story, a pony is generally smaller. As the best one of its type, it must also be the biggest one of its kind, too.\n\nHence, the best answer is that she could ride it to find out whether it is hers.\n\n### Input\"Which should come first: the chicken or the egg?\"\n\n### Response\n\nI think the story said that the chicken would come first but it would be wrong. If we need to choose it from the book, \"Which should come first the chicken or the eggs\", the chicken and eggs should come together. Otherwise, neither of them is the right one for the question.\n\nIt is a matter of fact that the world was created, then the chicken did not come first.\n\n### Response\"The wind is the only thing you can't control in this world\"\n\n### Demos:\nWe need to consider what the term \"control\" means. It means that someone could gain power over someone else, which is not the wind.\n\nIn another sense, it could also refer to the power of the \"control\". We cannot control the wind because it is very powerful. The people who created airplanes and sailboats made them stronger with the wind and water as the power. But they can not truly control them.

{"text": "There are a few reasons why this question could be confusing, the first is ambiguousness of the word \"he wanted,\" while it is probably referring to the child, it does not offer any context, there is no gender hint, it could mean:\n1. the child really wanted to do something, what was that? \n2. the child really wanted the child to do something with his grandpa.\n3. the child really wanted someone to teach the child something.\n4. the child really wanted his grandpa to behave differently.\n\nAnother source of confusion would be the phrase \"he ___ ____ his whole life.\" Here we can eliminate possibilities because some, like \"learning new things\" and \"illiterate\" would not apply to a person who had spent their entire life not doing them. \"Having fun\" or \"ignoring\" would also not apply to all of the time. The correct answer is A: \"he learned something new,\" as the grammatical form of the last phrase, using past participles, states unequivocally.", "answer": "D: illiterate"}
{"text": "#### Analysis:\nWe want to narrow down our possibilities by using a process of elimination.\n1. An answer choice that would receive compliments would be something that is done well. This would not require any skill; if it were, it would be a learned skill. Therefore, we can eliminate A: compliments.\n2. Stickers and avoidance of pain are both actions, neither of which requires any skill at all. If this were to be a skill, it would be a physical skill - i.e. if the assignment itself did not require any problem-solving or thoughtfulness but rather just an accurate execution of the task, one would not need to possess any specific skills and could just avoid pain altogether if they performed the assignment according to the teacher's requirements. If a student didn't understand or misread the instructions, they would not avoid pain and would end up with low marks as they completed the assignment. This doesn't seem like a useful skill so we can eliminate E: avoid pain.\n3. This leaves B: passing grade, C: intellectual challenge, and D: sticker as realistic possibilities. We are looking for a skill, and \"sticker\" is just an object and not a skill, hence we can eliminate D: sticker. The question tells us we need to find a skill, and we can reasonably expect that a student competent in their schoolwork would not be able to get a passing grade without doing something. Given that they have intellect and that this is in the realm of mental work, they would need to be good at using information (intellectual challenge). Therefore, the relevant choice is C: intellectual challenge and B: passing grade.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is A: B: passing grade and C: intellectul challenge\n\n### Input What is a thing that is most likely if we have lots of time? Choices: A: sleep B: do nothing C: eat D: socialize\n\n### Response\n\n\n1. The text \"lots of time\" is a clue that can help us narrow down our possibilities by process of elimination. If we have lots of time, we can do B) do nothing. Therefore, we can easily eliminate A) sleep and C) eat as a choice.\n2. \"to socialize\" is an action as well. However the word \"if\" connects with the words following the", "answer": "B: passing grade"}

This provides even stronger hints for two purposes: \n- To learn about where they live.\n- To keep contact or maintain your relationship.\nThis again narrows down the list of possible options to two:\n- To learn how their life has been while overseas. In this case, to seek knowledge of the world around them, \"though\" as a pronoun also suggests an analytical perspective.\n-  To keep in touch. The subject seems friendly enough to be curious about their overseas friend. \"Though\" here adds nuance to our answer by suggesting that our subject is slightly distant or less friendly than they used to be.

In this scenario, there are several indicators that suggest that our subjects are thinking about something related to their job/work life, because they are driving. Additionally, we are told that the subject is fantasy about getting a something (\"While driving to work the subject fantasies about getting something...\") and that they are analyzing the pros and cons of whatever it is they are fantasizing (The pros and cons of....).

The choices listed offer vague and ambiguous suggestions that are not logically connected to money, and so do not accurately explain what god wants people to do for money.\nWe can eliminate answer choice A immediately, as it seems to suggest that money is a \"given\" rather than something one works for.\nAs for answer choice B, money is typically earned through employment, the activity of getting and keeping jobs, rather than working on a life-long basis, or in the sense of working until one dies. We can also eliminate this answer choice, as it does not explain what god wants people do for money.\nNext, let us eliminate answer choice C: nowhere does the question say that god wants mankind to speak to people. We only have the context of money.\nAgain, answer choice D may sound like money is not the intended component of interpersonal relationship, but \"sitting\" is a relative term that one can also sit everywhere. The correct answer would need to be something general, rather than describing some form of interaction that does not exist. \"Care for people\" would not make sense in this instance, either: the question does not mention caring for anybody in particular, and if this were the case, god would likely ask us to pray of them instead.\nFinally, the correct answer is E: god wants people to interact with one another.\nAnswer: E: god wants people\n\n### Input:(Invest $1000) Dividends: $90 Tax Rate: 40% Investment Period: 5 years?

{"text": "Answer: A: fall asleep\n\n### Explanation: The question tells us that we would feel something when we go to the opera. The sentence is pretty vague and does not give us much information to work with. The word \"opera\" is used in two ways in English:\n\n- it's the name of a literary form originating in Italy in the 16th century.\n- an opera is a live performance art form in which music and singing form an integral part of the story or a particular narrative, usually performed on the stage. \n  - There is quite some variety in how opera is performed and many things that can be experienced in an opera.\n  - If one of our responses could be \"feel sick\", \"feel relaxed\", or \"feel bored\", the correct answer would be (D). As opera is an art form the question could be easily rephrased \"What would you experience when you watch an opera\" as (D).\n  - If the questions would have been \"What would you experience in a movie theater\" or \"What would you experience with a performance on stage\"? The correct answer would be \"fall asleep\" as this could never be an option for a movie going experience or a stage performance in a live show due to the dynamic environment.\n\n### Input A What kind of book might you give the person who has everything?

There is nothing in the question that would help us to decipher if it has to be a specific book or any kind of book. The book being referred to could be related to a person who is very wealthy, or could be something that you should give to the reader to gain their attention.\n\n###  The main task with regards to this is to determine that the question would be: \n  - What book would you want to recommend to someone if it would be sure they would like it?\n  - What kind of books would you want to recommend?\n\n### Choices:", "answer": "D: relaxation"}
{"text": "The correct answer is A: office building. In the US, people refer to a desk in such contexts as `office space` and `the workplace.` We can make this a more direct clue by focusing more on the location rather than the furniture:\n\n  - \"desk normally occupied by a person\"  suggests that we are looking for a workplace, but again it is not a bedroom since it is too personal and intimate for most professional environments.\n    \nBedroom is not the answer:  A: office space\n\n### A final question:Can you suggest a way someone suffering from insomnia could improve their sleeping habits? Choices: A: go to a spa B: see a doctor C: get a pet D: watch TV E: listen to music\n\n### Answer:Yes, going to a spa can help with insomnia. People tend to associate spas and relaxation with helping sleep and improving relaxation, and therefore, it makes sense that a person suffering from insomnia would benefit from this. In addition, having a pet close by during the night can also provide a sense of soothed relaxation and comfort that can lead to improved sleep habits.", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

{"text": "The most reasonable answer would be B: in a community. The main reason for this is that of the different options given, there aren't any that really make a great deal of sense. In most areas, there are distinct zones that are designed for a specific use. These include:\n- residential zones: for housing (for example, apartments).\n- commercial zones: for businesses.\n- agricultural zones: for growing food and keeping livestock. These areas are located far from urbanized areas.\n- industrial zones: for heavy industry (for example: refineries, or factories)\n\nSchools are most certainly not located in residential zones, since it would not make sense to have a school in an area where there are multiple houses and streets for people to navigate. Likewise the same logic applies to other areas - it does not make sense to have schools in commercial, agricultural, and industrial zones as they are also not considered \"communities,\" or residential areas.", "answer": "A: residential neighborhood"}

Choices A: the heart gets exhausted, B: the body can't work as fast, C: the brain gets tired, D: the legs start to stiffen, E: the nose gets stuffy\nRationales:\n\n1. The question is asking about what happens when the body doesn't get enough oxygen. This suggests that the subject is talking about something that happens when one is deprived of oxygen.\n2. The list of symptoms describes what will tend to happen when the body does not have enough oxygen.\n3. Based on the context and the information given in the problem, since oxygen deprivation most often affects people who are sleeping, it seems likely that one of the symptoms we see in the problem is the stuffy nose or stuffy ears that one feels while going to sleep. Therefore, the correct answer is A: \"the heart gets exhausted, because the body does not get as much oxygen as it needs.\"\nAnswer: A: the heart gets tired", "answer": "E: die of starvation"}
{"text": "Ordering dog food online is not a common sign that someone's lying.\n\n### Rationale:\n- This is an odd-looking response to a straightforward prompt. While it fulfills the instructions to provide an response, it doesn't directly address the questions posed.\n  - The instruction asks us to come up with a response, but the rationale is that the response we provided doesn't seem to follow the question. We could have directly written the response \"Ordering dog food online isn't a common sign that someone;s lying\" or elaborated the rationale by explaining why this response doesn't fulfill the task.\n- The instruction asks us to respond by writing a single, complete sentence; rather than providing a one-word answer. We can provide a response fulfilling the task but fulfilling the instructions too.\n\n### Response 2:\n\n- The instruction describes a task of choosing the most likely sign that someone is lying. It does not provide an exact description of this sign, however one can determine the possible answers by considering the phrases within the instruction.\n- The choices are phrased in such a way that they could conceivably be the signs that someone is lying. Since we're given multiple choices, we can't discard them from the start. However, we can eliminate some options as less likely than the others by considering how unusual those choices would be and whether they fit the context within the question.\n- We can conclude that falling asleep or blushing in response to a lie are very unusual. They do not logically fit the context, which is that someone is lying and looking for signs for confirming this.\n- We can also conclude that avoiding eye contact and feeling guilty are more likely to be signs that someone is lying, since a person who's lying would avoid looking at or mentioning something related to the truth of their lie, or feeling guilty for doing something they otherwise wouldn't be ashamed of doing.\n- In terms of this latter criteria, we can consider whether ordering dog food would be something a person would feel guilty at ordering. To order dog food seems to be a normal activity without a strong emotional response, unless the person feels guilty or self-conscious for ordering it. A person ordering dog food could be guilty for not owning a dog, but if ordered to a person with a dog then this isn't the case. Ordering", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}

{"text": "Bob is visiting the most likely scenario being a swimming pool.\n##### Rationales:\n1. The term swimming pool is an ambiguous term in English in that it can refer to a number of similar things or facilities, and the difference between them relies on context and other words in the sentence.\n2. \"goggles\" strongly suggests some sort of swimming equipment, as goggles would be something one would wear while swimming.\n3. Furthermore, the context of this sentence leads me to believe that Bob is \"in a dressing room, putting on\" an item of clothing, which would be a piece of swimwear in contrast to what one \"would not find\" in an actors dressing room (actor).\n4. This is further supported by the fact that Bob can only \"put on\" (this is very literal) \"trunks\" and \"goggles\", which would be necessary to swim in.\n5. Finally, as the question asks \"What sort of facility is he visiting?\", the question does not refer to what Bob is doing after visiting the facility, but rather the facility itself. This narrows down the possible choices to things that act as swimming pools/things related to swimming.\n6. The answer does not refer to the reason for Bob's visit, but rather the type of facility he is visiting, so if the answer did refer to his reason for visiting, it might possibly be a swimming pool for exercise and fitness, since it provides the question that Bob is putting on goggles and trunks.\n7. In the end, the most likely interpretation is that Bob is visiting a swimming pool, as it is the only possible facility that a swimmer might visit, and as Bob specifically puts on swimming related items, he is most likely visiting a swimming facility.\n\n### Input :He fantasized about his future job : Which of these jobs would require him to deal with lots of paperwork?

{"text": "The artist decided to sell out to get more paid.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question gives us several signs to analyze the answer. The phrases \"time for cashing in\" and \"selling out\" are almost identical, implying that the subject is looking for more money by taking actions related to his artistic activities.\n\nThe first phrase is also prefaced with an expression of time that puts it in the past. We know that the actions we took at a time in the past led us to another place or state, so these actions were also performed in the past, which further supports the analysis that the subject is selling out to get more money.\n\nThe term \"happiness\" is used in the question itself, and is also used in the context of the artist's actions, implying their irrelevance. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that what is being analyzed does not relate to happiness or artistic expression at all.\n\nFurthermore, we know that our answer will not be a physical activity. The word \"fishing\" is a valid English word, which shows that in the sentence it does not refer to the activity of catching things by hand in the water with a hook.\n\nAnswering questions, we have come to understand that the correct answer is \"selling out to get paid\".", "answer": "A: selling out"}

{"text": "### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration:Input: Who is a good candidate for a work from home position? Choices: .A: introverts B: extroverts C: sociable individuals D: people who dislike being confined to their desks\n\n## Rationale:  1. The text asks who makes a good candidate for work from home position. As it is not specific, it should be assumed that the position would either allow someone to work from home or it would require the person to work from home. If the position required a specific quality from those who took the job, the question would be \"Which of the following is a job requirement...\". 2. Since the word \"candidate\" is used, the assumption is that this is an employee or perhaps a prospective one. Employing someone for the first time would require knowing them on a basic level. The only things that are explicitly defined in this statement, and are thus knowable, are personality traits.  3. Since both B&C are positive personality adjectives, we can rule out A, the negative adjective. When you hear either A or B, you will feel one way about the candidate: either she isn't introvert enough, or not extrovert enough. 4. When you hear D or E, you will feel one thing: that the person is somehow wrong, averse, or unlike the other people working there. 5. Thus, the only answer that provides no negative feelings is C.  6.

We can thus expect \"non-mammal\" to have some adaptations, and it's reasonable to assume that since it's from the ocean, those would have to be in relation to its ocean environment.\n3.

{"text": "The correct answer is C.\n\n### Explain your answer:\n\nYou could have guessed that \"underwear\" was the answer just with a small logic deduction and some analysis of the word usage. The question suggests a large family, so the piles of dishes may be more due to people not bothering to clean their dishes than a result of a large family, so that answer is out. The question also has the word \"dishes,\" but the context leads one to consider other types of garbage, so that answer is also out. Likewise, the words \"with a large family\" could be used figuratively, implying that family members frequently eat together, which doesn\u2019t fit well with the image of a sink pile and bad breath.\n\nAs for \"fullness,\" it has a physical interpretation, so it is excluded as well. \"Fullness\" might be a reason for \"dirty dishes,\" but this would not suggest bad breath being the most likely side-effect. \"Better day\" would also make a better answer because it conforms to the context. And \"dirty dishes\" itself, though used loosely and figuratively, and also does not fit well with the image and physical interpretation of \"bad breath\" from eating so much. It fits best with \"dirty dishes.\"\n\nIf you look carefully, the word \"underwear\" is listed twice in the question, which is a clue that it is the best answer, and this is also confirmed by using the context of what the question is asking about. \"Underwear\" may be the result of a large family rather than being related to eating breakfast, as it is mentioned more in references to eating breakfast.", "answer": "E: dirty dishes"}

Choices:  a. stand still b. standing still c. wallflower d. dance like crazy e. like dancing\n```\n\n* Input: The boy was too nervous\n* Demonstration: He was progressively standing still \n* Conclusion: I had to think for a few minutes to narrow down the answer. The boy was doing progressively at this ball? I wasn't sure exactly what the phrase meant, and I don't think the context made it any more obvious. I needed more hints that this wasn't a simple question of asking him to dance.\n* Key: the phrase \"progressively\" meant he was getting steadily better at standing still. \"standing still\" is a phrase you could use to describe someone standing completely still. That gave me the idea to replace standing still with \"standing,\" which made a lot more sense. So the boy was progressively doing what at this ball?

The original question didn't include any information about what type of dance it was. The boy was doing this \"at the ball\" and the clue was that he was nervous, so it could be anything from a waltz to a salsa, for example.\n\n### I have had several questions along these lines in my exams and was a bit confused by it.

This tells us that whatever is described is something that such a person feels or experiences on a regular basis.\n\nAs for the rest of the question, we can look for some clues in the descriptions provided:\n\n- \"early death,\" however, would seem to be too great of a burden for anyone to bear, let alone experience frequently. This answer does not make sense.\n- \"valuable\" also sounds too strong an adjective to be appropriate to the context, so we can rule it out early.\n- \"joy\" is not something that one \"feels\" specifically, and is more of a broad emotion; we can discard A.\n- \"happiness\" is a more general feeling than what would be expected of an individual experiencing life fully, and might refer to the feelings of someone whose life has gone smoothly in general as opposed to being extraordinary or extreme. B does not seem to fit.\n- \"adventurous\" sounds far too positive, optimistic, and exciting to refer to feelings experienced regularly. It would indicate a person with an unusual amount of courage, drive, or thrill-seeking behavior, which does not appear to be the impression we are supposed to get from \"living life fully.\" D also does not work.\n\nThat leaves us only with E, which refers to something that is exciting or remarkable, which might indeed be the feeling one would get from a rich, vibrant, and full life.

In this context, a deal doesn't need to be completed and there's no need for arguing, making progress is only the first step of achieving a deal.\n- The fact that both parties of the deal were able to reach tentative agreements indicates that the deal has been completed successfully.\n- Doing business means doing business and reaching a deal is the most important thing people have to do.\n- The fact the two sides are able to reach tentative deal is a feat to what, it needs to be doing business.\n- So the correct answer is D: do business.\n\n### Input\nHow to explain why the two brothers were able to reach an agreement on how to divide the estate, despite their disagreement about how to divide up the cash?

{"text": "Society cannot exist on their own.   They only rise within the population.  \n\n### Rationales:\nThe question is very specific in that it describes both the type of entity to be mentioned, numbers, and the location in which numbers may exist, i.e. spaces. It might not be clear at first, but this suggests that we need to describe two different locations where the specific entity can be contained, one being \"a population\" and the other \"a population of.\"\n\nThe key to finding the correct answer is to look carefully at the wording and determine what kind of spatial relationship it suggests\u2014\"numbers\" can be \"within\" or \"in\" a specific type of entity, but what entity does the word \"they\" refer to?  The clues we have are \"cannot...exist without...\" and \"rise up...in what sort of spaces.\"\n\nGiven these two facts, we can infer that \"they\" must mean \"numbers\" because they \"exist without...any space.\" However, they only \"rise\" when \"numbers are contained\" within populations. Numbers arise within \"populations\" but they do not arise within the population area itself; otherwise the phrasing would not make sense. So the correct answer has to be either A or C.\n\nConsidering that the subject is a collective unit, we can eliminate D. Although it refers to \"individuals,\" \"group\" is probably not referring to an individual group of people, but instead a larger group of people, such as a society. So we have to eliminate D. This leaves us at a choice between A and C.\n\nThe question states that numbers only rise up in \"what sort of spaces?\", with the spaces themselves being of a specific form\u2014they must be \"a population.\" Because numbers can only be conceived of as a part of a population, the numbers must necessarily be \"within\" a population, so our only choice remaining is C: population. The best answer is C: \"a population.\"\n\nAnswer: C: population", "answer": "B: populated area"}

Choices: 1: a car ride 2: ride the car 3: a car 4: a ride 5: car ride answer: 1: a ride\n\n### Demostration:\nThe question asks us whether a car ride away from a beach should be called a \"car ride\", thus prompting us to consider the answer being a term related to a car. We are not given a location (beach), nor a specific activity for the car ride (for example, a drive, commute, trip, etc.) Thus we cannot immediately determine the likely candidate to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, the context can help us narrow our options. The beach is a common subject found in summer activities, implying that the car ride would most commonly take place during summer. Also, it is most likely that the car ride is away from the beach (such as in order to reach it), since otherwise it wouldn't make much sense to ask for the name of such a ride. This narrows our options even more, as it would be unlikely to be called a \"car drive\", a \"car trip\", \"car commute\", or \"car drive\".\n\nIn addition, the options are very obviously nonsensical given the situation or the terms themselves. For example, it would not be called a \"ride the car\" (as this sounds like the ride is inside the car), a \"car\" (as this sounds more like a name for the car), or a \"car ride\" (again, this sounds like the name of the car). Thus, only the answer 1, a \"ride\", makes logical sense within the given terms and context, and it is thus the correct answer.", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

{"text": "Input: An animal must what in order to maintain balance while running quickly? Choices:  X: have four legs Y: have six legs\nRationales: I would like to give my reason in terms of physics here, because that's what it's based on. When you look at the question, you must realize that this is about an animal walking, which we all know is a two-legged process (the quadrupedal example is incorrect, as all four legs do not touch the ground at the same time, and are always in motion simultaneously in a way that is very different than bipedal motion). So the question is really asking, given that this animal needs to move using only two legs, what other mechanisms must be employed in order to maintain coordination while going rapidly? Now here are the possible answers, and a logic behind why these are incorrect.\n     - A: Have Four Legs: This is not a correct answer because the question asks what animals must do in order to balance when moving quickly on two legs.\n     - B: Have Six Legs: This is also not a correct answer, because this would apply to animals with more limbs than just their main legs. As an extension from this is the question regarding four legs and six legs, the animal would be expected to have four limbs. So this answer doesn't make sense either.\n     - X: Have Four Legs. This is not a correct response because while the animal does need to walk with the main two legs that the question is about, the animal still needs to walk even with the two secondary legs that it has. This is what the question is asking: given that the animal has to walk on two legs, what else must be done to keep the animal balanced? So, without even thinking, one has to note that the animal must keep walking using the second set of legs, which are also on two legs. This is why this answer is incorrect.\n     - Y: Calculate Everything Quite Quickly. This is not a valid response because the question doesn't mention that the animal needs to think a lot, although calculating could be the way to avoid an accident from balancing. All in all, this is definitely not a valid response.\n     - D: Fight the enemy quickly.

Choices: A: read B: exercising C: doing what is relaxing D: watching television E: being with friends F: none of the above\n\n### Rationales: A. None of the Above:  First, we should notice that \"he would unwind\" is being replaced by \"he does,\" which creates an indication that the subject is present. This is further reinforced by phrases such as \"watching television\" that clearly refer to recent activities. Thus, the subject isn't reading or doing anything relaxing; they are watching TV.\nB. Exercising:  Next, we should see that the phrase \"watching television\" is not a verb, which can't precede the present participle \"exercising.\" The subject is either watching TV or exercising, and exercising is clearly indicated.\n\nC. Reading: The phrase \"reading\" also doesn't precede the verb \"doing,\" which is a bit clearer because it means performing activities and thus is related to doing something. In either case, the verb phrase being used is a little funny, which indicates that there was at least one error, suggesting there is one answer that is at least partially wrong. As the verb \"doing\" cannot be referring to exercising, this leaves only one option: D: watching television\n\nD. None of the A above: The most telling clue is the phrase \"doing what is relaxing,\" which states explicitly that the subject is doing something. In either scenario, \"reading.\" \"watching TV,\" or \"exercising,\" the subject is performing a specific activity and therefore cannot be doing what is relaxing.

{"text": "The answer to the question is \"E: peculiar.\"The answer is to be derived by going through the various phrases in the question. In the question, we are told that Sally took her medicine and then we find out that there were side effects. In order for someone to think a side effect is something to be \"great,\" \"distinguished,\" \"remarkable,\" or \"excellent,\" there must have been a pre-existing thought that some other medication, or a specific effect of a different medication may have been very good, excellent, or perfect. This is not the case in the following sentence when Sally took medication she experienced a whole bunch of different side effects. As the phrase \"a bunch of\" implies that Sally experienced many different side effects to her medicine, none of these side effects were perfect. Hence, the correct and only right answer is \"E: peculiar,\" as this is the only phrase that makes sense.\n\n### Input answer: John had a busy afternoon so he planned a few things. What did he do at the end? Choices: A: watched television B: went for a swim C: sat down and read a book D: took a bath E: went out to eat\n\n### Question answer:\nTaking a bath or going out to eat are events that are specific in the task. These are things he will definitely finish.\nBut John had a busy day so he had many things to do. So what is left is A or D.\nThe question is not asking what activities John would be doing on the \"last day,\" but the \"next few things.\"\nOn the last few things on the list, these are ones that are not so specific. We can deduce from the question that we can find the answer in these activities.\n\n- \"planed one or two more things\" is the task at hand. We can deduce that there are unplanned things which is the left over activities or residual. Planned things take priority over the unplanned ones.\n- The time has passed by, so it can be deduced that John had a busy day, so he would not spend time on unplanned activities.\n- The answer must be the first things in the list of activities\n- He did something to relax himself as he had a busy day; which is D - to take a bath\n\n### Conclusion: We conclude that John answered the question", "answer": "C: remarkable"}
{"text": "### Instruction Answer the following multiple choice question:\n### Demonstraion:\nInput: You can buy a pen here\nRaonals: The text describes an activity called \"buying a pen.\" This suggests that we are dealing not just with a pen (i.e., a concrete object), but also with some particular context, in which we can say the subject \"can buy the pen.\" Hence, the subject will probably be buying the pen, meaning that we will have a question that asks about the activity in which the subject engages.\nThe text makes an announcement: \"You can buy a pen,\" suggesting that there are different locations where a pen can be bought. This gives us another clue to the actual setting in which the activity takes place.\nGiven these clues, the correct answer would be A: briefcase. \nChoices:  A: Briefcase B: Pocket C: Friend's house: Office supply store: Classroom D:\n\nAnswer: A: Briefcase\n\n### Instructions:\n### Demostration:\nInput: His wife, a nurse, called him.

Usually, a layover is used when flying from multiple terminals at an airport, but the answer that the question is looking for is not airport. The answer, instead, is likely a computer network. For example, \"I had a DNS issue so my connection was delayed for a couple hours, and I had to log into the company WiFi to get it fixed,\" which is a realistic problem that I have run into multiple times while traveling. The use of \"connection\" in the prompt indicates a type of connection or network, rather than any form of physical connection.

E) at one fire station near a fire station that is outside of a water fountain near a military base.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. People often stand near a line which is why you see them standing on a line. They often stand at a line near an outside bus stop or a water fountain where they usually stand around at a fire station. In this case, it is logical to stand at a fire station since it is near a bus stop or water fountain outside. We can answer choice C: near a bus stop near fire station.\n2. Similarly, in choice B: outside the fire station near the bus stop and near the water fountain, people often stand near the military base that is next door to the fire station. Hence, the answer is A: outside a fire station and the military base that is near to a water fountain or outside of a military base.", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

He had a 3-foot long, three-sectioned steel pole, and was pushing it towards a fence next to a large garage. As he pushed the pole towards the fence, it slid into a three-sectioned steel fence pole, bent it and caused the fence to collapse. When the fence collapsed, it fell across a parked car, crushing and injuring an elderly couple in the car. The boy ran home, crying and his mother was called. Upon hearing what had just taken place, his mother told the police that her son must be punished, and the couple must be paid reparation for the damage to their car. At the trial the judge gave her a long lecture about her unjustified cruelty to the boy, and sentenced her to 3 years of probation.

{"text": "This response states that if a student was about to be released from kindergarten, their schooling would come to an end.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe response correctly interprets the clue \"they would no longer be atteding school,\". This points to a time in which the student is no longer in school - when they graduate. Furthermore, when a student graduates, it is commonly understood that they are no longer able to continue attending their previous school. Since kindergarten classes involve a certain level of on-going schooling, the response accurately states that graduating from kindergarten class would not allow one to continue attending kindergarten. This implies that you would no longer be able to attend kindergarten.\n\n### Input\nHow old is the oldest child?

There are a number of possible answers, so we must rule them out as we go and use logical analysis, such as elimination.\n\n### First question\n\nThe question asks \"what is the most efficient way...\" This means we must be looking for a process that is quick and easy to implement.\n\n### Second question\n\nThe question is what the most common way to \"start a sentence\" is.

{"text": "This question is very similar to the one above, but with a different context. In this case, a hypothetical subject cannot wash their smelly clothes, and they are wondering whether they should just hang them in the closet or keep wearing them.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the question text.\n1. The sentence \"if clothes have developed a smelly do not be able to wash what should one do with them,\" suggests that the subject is concerned about clothes that have developed a smell.\n2. This suggests that the answer to this question should be \"hang them in a closet\" or \"don't wash them.\"\n3. After narrowing this down to the answers \"hang them in a clostet\" or \"don\"t wash them,\" we ask how we can narrow that down further. This means that the most logical answer would have to be one that suggests they shouldn't wash them.\n4. \"air out\" suggests that the smells should only come from bacteria or something similar. This means that the subject shouldn't wear dirty clothes, and their clothes should be washed.\n5. \"Soiled\" is often used in relationship to food, not clothing. \"Get dirty\" should have been used, but didn't quite work in this case.\n6. The phrase \"a smell and can'tn be washed\" implies that there isn't anything wrong with the clothes except for a bad smell. This means that they can be washed.\n7. The subject cannot decide which answer is right. Hence, the most logical answer to this question would be \"hang in the closet,\" as this would prevent the subject from getting a bad smell on them by wearing dirty clothing. The correct answer is C: don't wash them\n\n### Input \n\nYour friend, who is a fan of a fantasy football league, asks when your fantasy team plays.

Because this is often the case, the options are narrowed down to \"education\" as a learning outcome and \"effectiveness\" as an effect on an outcome, but in either case does not change the fact that it is a result of not learning.\n- Distress can refer to emotional state, but the other keywords cannot refer to such state, but rather the other aspects discussed - intelligence, education, and effectiveness.\n\nWe therefore have distress as an answer, but it may also refer to an emotional state, which is why there are two answers.\nAnswer: A: intelligence\n\n### Instructions:What are some characteristics of someone who is disinterested in learning?

{"text": "[1]\nForgiveness is one of those words that seem to come with heaps of baggage \u2014 and for good reason. One of the most hurtful words in any language (next to, perhaps, \"unconditional love\"), forgiveness implies blame. Saying you forgive someone implies an admission that the relationship you once had was damaged, but that you\u2019ve made a conscious decision to not let what happened get in the way of a future relationship. So, if you\u2019re willing to admit guilt \u2014 and take blame \u2014 to make sure everything stays smooth, why shouldn\u2019t the person you\u2019ve forgiven do the same? What else can you expect?\n[2]\nThe most common example of a hidden force activated after a period of time spent working on forgiveness is that of a person who no longer struggles with anger, as opposed to someone who struggles with anger and continues to struggle with forgiveness.\nIt's probably best to ask yourself, \"how long ago did I start this journey?\" If it's been a year or two, it's probably not a great day to have the forgiveness process derailed. If it's been more than five years, then there is no reason to feel like you are going to lose what you have achieved.\n[3]\nBut, in the same vein, there is a good possibility that the most important thing to do on that first day is to give yourself permission to be forgiven, for the way you have chosen to live your life from this point forward regardless of what it was before. Forgiveness is not easy - and it doesn't happen right away - but it is the first step. It may not be the most important step, or the easiest step, but it's a very big one.\n[4]I think that the forgiveness you desire has gotten so stuck inside of you that you cannot move it forward - your heart wants to forgive, but your mind is the one that says it's not possible. When I forgive I make a mental commitment to myself that I am 100% committed to forgiveness.\nThe second step is forgiving your thoughts, even though we have no control over them.\nA third step you can take on your journey is learning to truly forgive yourself.

{"text": "The word \"beer\" is ambiguous, so the answer can't be \"buying beer\" as per the instruction. The subject \"someone\" refers to someone who is driving, so the sentence is talking about drinking and driving. This narrows the options and \"intoxication\" seems most appropriate, so the correct answer is D: intoxication.\n\n### Input\nWhy might someone want to drive on the wrong side of the road? Choice: A: get arrested B; no more left turns C: no more right turns D: they do not know better\nRationales\n1. The word \"want\" has a vague meaning, and can be used to talk about the subject's thoughts, motivations and intentions. In this case, the choice options suggest that there are many reasons a driver might be driving on the wrong side of a road.\n2. When \"someone\" drives down the left lane instead of the right one, this is often called a \"left turn\", as the correct flow would be a left turn first, then a right turn. When describing this as \"a left turn\" rather than \"a turn of any kind\", the implication is that the left turn is the only option for the driver in terms of traveling in the right direction. This suggests that the subject might not know any better, since driving on the wrong side is an option because they can't make a left turn; if there were no left options, they wouldn't be able to \"get arrested\" and they would just follow the traffic flow (so they'd be \"doing what most people would expect\"). Thus, the only possible answer is C: no more left turns.\n\n### Response\nThe question states why someone might want to drive on the right side even though they are aware they will get arrested, and the answer tells us why they might still be driving on the wrong lane. The sentence structure would read \"Why they might drive on the left side, instead of the right, even after they get arrested\", and the correct question is \"Why would someone drive on the left lane instead if the correct option?\"\n\n### Input \nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.

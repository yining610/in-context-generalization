Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Google Maps and other highway and street GPS services have replaced what? Choices:  A: united states B: mexico C: countryside D: atlas E: oceans<n><n>### Response:		2.a<n><n>### Rationales: 1."the question says" and also the question  "have replaced what", that means it was replaced by something, so replace united states, mexico, countryside, atlas, oceans.<n>2. In the context sentence, we can see that "Google maps" is used to mean "a service" used for navigation, <n>3. The answer "map" is a singular noun, which can be used for navigation, and can be used in the plural form, for several maps. <n>4. In the context sentence "we" refers to "we do not need to find our own way around". This could also be referring to maps as in "we need no maps" which are both singular, so the answer would be "map" as singular.<n>In the context sentence, the words used can not be interchanged, "replaced" means eliminated, and "map" doesn't make sense in all of the words in the choices.  <n><n>### Input:"I've never been to Africa, but I would love to see it one day." what is the intended meaning of the sentence? Choices:A: I would like to see Africa someday B: I don't want to visit Africa C: I don't know when I will visit Africa D: My dream is to visit Africa<n><n><n>### Response:"I've never..."<n><n>### Rationale:The sentence reads "I've never been there" which refers to Africa, so the sentence is "I've never gone to Africa" which means "I've never visited Africa", hence answer B.<n><n>### Response"I would like to see it one day"<n><n>### Rationle: <n>You can see that there is an adverb "soon",and the sentence starts with a noun(day), and "soon" means "one day", so that's why we should answer that<n><n>### Instructions<n>Input: At the restaurant, I ordered shrimp and what with a side of rice.

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:The forgotten leftovers had gotten quite old, he found it covered in mold in the back of his what? Choices:  A: carpet B: refrigerator C: breadbox D: fridge E: coach<n><n>### Response:		A<n>### Rationales:1. The phrase "forgotten leftovers" suggests food.<n>2. The text further explains that the forgotten leftovers have aged and grown moldy. Although there are many things that can get moldy, one that is associated with food and thus more likely to appear in someone's kitchen is the refrigerator.<n>3. Finally, the answer choice "what" indicates a container, and a refrigerator does contain food that has mold on it so is indeed a "what". Hence, the answer would be C: refrigerator.

Choices:  A: harder B: anguish C: bitterness D: tears E: sadness<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to the question above is "anguish." In order to determine the answer, we should first analyze the question sentence:<n><n>"Before getting a divorce...?"<n><n>This phrase implies that the speaker is answering a question, likely from the wife. This provides clues to the type of emotions the wife was experiencing before the divorce, which are generally related to being in a romantic relationship and doing domestic work for one's spouse.<n>Next, we should consider the subject of the question:<n><n>"the wife"<n><n>Because the subject is a woman, we should assume that she's speaking to her husband and refer to her as "the wife" rather than "husband." It wouldn't make sense to use "the husband" in response to a question about the wife's emotions, as these would likely be about doing domestic work for her husband.<n>Next, we must determine the emotions the wife was feeling:<n><n>"who was doing all the work?"<n><n>This question implies that the wife perceives the husband as being lazy or unmotivated in performing household tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, or taking care of children. It's possible that the husband was actually completing these tasks but that the wife was resentful due to gender stereotypes, which assume female primary responsibility and male privilege.<n>Finally, the answer to the question will depend on the wife's feelings about doing this work:<n><n>"what did the wife feel who...??"<n><n>Here, we're focusing on feelings after completing an action, not the action itself. Therefore, the answer choice must be an emotion, not a physical action, such as "work."<n>So, we can combine these inferences to identify the correct answer choice, which is "anguish." To recap, the answer is C: anguish.<n>

Choices:  A: neighborhood B: subdivision C: city D: suburbs E: street<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I would start looking in neighborhoods. A house that is gated off is a common sign of a neighborhood, as gated communities exist to seal a home from other things and people. <n><n>### Rationale:<n>The question is designed to elicit the answer "neighborhood," which we can get by following the logical steps to solve the problem. Neighborhoods are communities built around a specific location, are enclosed by gates to keep everyone safe, and contain houses of various types. Therefore, our possible answers would have to be neighborhood, maybe subdivision (due to the wording "from other places"), or city. We can eliminate options D, E, and C as they would not contain houses. As far as the question is asking for a "where to start looking," a neighborhood fits the bill, indicating that a gated house would indicate membership to the neighborhood. Thus, the neighborhood is the correct answer choice B: neighborhood.<n><n>### Input<n>What would she ask her husband if she wanted to go to a movie on a Friday night? Choices: 1. A: Will you go with me? 2. B: Is John free? 3. C: Will you drive me over there? 4. D: Where should we go? 5. E: Do you mind if I invite an extra friend?<n><n>### Response<n>"Where should we go?"<n>It doesn't mention anything about time, and the question just states "Friday night".<n><n>### Rational:<n>The wording of the question indicates that we can take the assumption that we are not asked to choose the most likely scenario, but rather one where the situation is given, the husband is free, so they have plenty of time with nothing else to do. The husband and wife have planned to go to the movie together, so we are looking at one of the remaining options. As we are looking to go to a movie, the logical choice of 3 is the correct one. Going to the movies requires some form or transportation (be that with or without a driver), an activity, and a couple for people. We are assuming movies are a shared activity and the man can do the driving, so 1 and 2 are eliminated. This leaves us with 1, 3, and 5 as logical answers. But because the husband is mentioned in the question, 3

Which of these would be the correct thing to say? Choices: 1)  That's awesome. 2)  If that what you have I'm interested in speaking to you. 3) I hate it when managers lie with the intent to hire. 4) The interview went very, very well. 5) If you pass the background check, let's do it.<n><n>Answer: If you look at the response that is given here, notice the answer given is "The interview went very, very will.” This is obviously not the correct answer. We'd like to try to find the sentence in the problem instruction that would provide some hints as to the location of the answer in the question. Let's look at these hints:<n><n>The boss wants to hire the candidate. This doesn't provide many clues.<n><n>The boss still would like the candidate, but only if he passes a background check.

Which of these would not be acceptable by the HR coordinator? Choices: <n><n>"The interview went very, will" the wrong answer is given here. Since the interviewer said the interview went well, this must not be an acceptable response by the HR coordinators. We can be very confident with this. The other answer that isn't acceptable is “If you pass the background check” it's not acceptable by the HR Coordinator because this is the wrong response that should be given by the coach after the interview.<n><n>Finally, the boss said these words to the candidate: <n><n>"If that's what

Choices:  A: brain problems B: laziness C: get fat D: headache E: laughter<n><n>### Response:		What you mean brain problems? Sitting up close while watching TV causes you to get fat.<n><n>### Output: Headache<n><n>### Rationales: 1: The question states that sitting too close to a TV can cause what? We are expected to analyze the structure of the question and figure out what exactly is causing the problem. The logical choice is "sitting up close to the TV."<n>2. Now let's see what we can take from that statement in order to come up with a possible solution.<n>    - The statement says that sitting up close to the TV causes what. We are not interested in the effect of this event but in its cause. What do we know about sitting up close to the tv that may cause a headache? Well, we sit too close and squint and look at it for too long and that sort of thing, hence the logical explanation would be 'getting a headache.'<n>3. Let's analyze the choices again. The only thing that causes a headache is excess exposure to light. Hence, the correct choice has to be "get fat."<n>Answer: C: get fat<n><n>### Input:(Driving on the Interstate) is fun. Is fun. Is boring what you think?<n><n>### Response:(Driving on I-20) is boring what you think.<n><n>###  Output:(Fantasizing on your drive to work) is fun. Is fantasizing fun?<n><n>### Rationale. 1. Is fun is a sentence which is ambiguous. It can be interpreted as asking what we think about something based on its description (is fun a definition phrase or an adjective phrase, in this case?). The question tells us about what the subject is doing, so we can narrow it down by analyzing the sentences.<n>2. Fantasizing is generally boring. Fun is something enjoyable, light-hearted, cheerful, etc., so "fantasizing about something fun" is inherently contradictory. Therefore, based on the context, the only logical conclusion is that fun = "is boring." We can infer from this that 'is fun.' is a phrase meaning "doesn't give you fun," or "isn't fun." Thus a good way to respond to this question would be "(Driving on the interstate) is ______ what you think?".<n>

Choices:  A: under rocks B: manhattan C: toenails D: grocery store E: fallen tree<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer in this question is under rocks.<n><n>### Explanation: <n>We can infer this choice based the given context, specifically that "fungus grow(s)" and "sunlight not be disturbed." These clues might suggest a moist environment, such as soil or mud, with no bright sunlight. While some fungi live in soil, many (such as mushrooms and molds) grow on dead plant material that is damp, or in the moist environment inside of decaying trees. Fungal growth is therefore excluded in options B (Manhattan) and D (the grocery store), while A (under rocks) can be ruled out by virtue of sunlight being mentioned in the problem.

But the book must also be useful, and be a good story. So it can't be option B. Similarly we can eliminate option D. <n><n>### Explination<n>1. Option A is the first one to be eliminated because it can't be all three <n>2. Option D can be eliminated because option D says that a book has to have an interesting title. But this is not required since whats important is the content. Moreover titles do not make the books useful or interesting...<n>3. Option C can be eliminated because it says that the book has to be a good story and be useful. But it can only be a good story... Hence by process of elimination, the option left is B. Which says that the book should be interesting but not useful or a good story.<n>Option B: The book must interesting, and useful, but it can't be a good story...<n><n>Answer: B: The book must be interesting<n><n>### Input : You could never get bored of watching a tennis match.

Choices:  A: closet B: library of congress C: classroom D: in bed E: desk<n><n>### Response:		The logical choice is answer choice C, the classroom. C, which is classified as a place, can either be taken literally as an actual room or be interpreted more loosely as an area (such as the bedroom or kitchen) where one would often keep a book to read. Therefore, the context is telling us to search for an answer choice that can be classified as a place. Out of the possible answer choices, the classroom option most clearly satisfies this contextual cue, and it also happens to also be the actual answer. Therefore, we cannot eliminate any of the answer choices as incorrect in any way, so there is no point to choose an answer choice on principle only, as some students have a tendency to do in this case.Answer: C: classroom<n>

Choices:  A: violence B: falling down C: vomiting D: vomiting E: lower standards<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Demonstration:<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>1. "angry after getting drunk" is the key phrase.<n>2. The question is whether the person who gets angry after getting drunken is more likely to "participate in" something. The key word is *participate in,* which suggests that they may engage in some kind of action or activity that involves more than one person. In this context, it could refer to a sports game, or even just a game or friendly competition involving more than one person.<n>3. Violent behavior or physical altercations are the only valid responses, as a person who engages in this type of behavior in the setting of alcohol consumption is more likely to have a drunk driving charge added to their aresenal of driving offenses. Vomiting is a sign of drunkenness, but it does not make someone an angry, irritable, or belligerent person. In fact, many people feel less inhibited and more relaxed after getting drunk, but this is not what the context demands.<n>4. Considering the context, it is most likely that the drunk person is more likely to participate in violent behavior or fights. Hence, the correct response is A: violence.<n>Answer: A: violence<n><n>### Input :The reason she missed the bus was that ______________.<n><n>### Response :<n><n>Demonstratiosn:<n><n>Rationals :<n><n>1.

Were there any you had trouble getting started with?<n>In class, we touched on two different types of questions: open-ended questions and multiple choice questions, which are questions that include multiple answer choices instead of just one. Consider which of these you have more struggled with. Why do you think this is? Are there particular types of questions easier for you than others? If we reframe the questions as another example - e.g., using open-ended answers - do you have any ideas for how to make these questions more approachable?<n>Finally, when you have more time, consider how the language on test questions affects your perception and ability to start the task. For instance, take a look at the following question:<n><n><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mwmjfbnw3500vdo/openended.png?dl=0" width="500" /><n><n>When I present the above, I sometimes hear learners answer, in a question (i.e., "in a good way" or "not well," etc.):<n><n><img src="/img/c.png" width="200" /><n>Sometimes, this answer is due to the misreading of the item - i.e., "yes" being the response to "do you do well?" when in fact, the question is referring to "well" being a good thing or "bad" being a bad thing, and "yes" representing that "bad" would be more appropriate.<n>If I do not

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

When I got arrested in court, it changed my life.<n><n>The police officer who arrested me had a very spiritual side. He told me that I should learn to do yoga and try to be more positive.<n><n>After being arrested by the police officer, I thought about the things he had said and started to learn yoga.<n><n>I was very surprised when he told me that.

Choices:  A: living room B: dog park C: basket D: small apartment E: big house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer: C: dog park<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>Answer: In the question, it is stated that the dog felt like it had the "space in the world" after it went outside. Since we know that the term'space' here refers to the physical room itself and not the distance in between objects, we can immediately cross out the other answers as these are not the correct options.<n><n>The answer to the question is A: 'living room,' as this is indeed where the dog felt the most space it could have ever felt. It is a large area where the dog can roam freely in and out. Hence, we can conclude the dog felt most at ease and at home when it was with its family in the living room.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>#### Reference: [Amazon's AI for job interview transcription](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-ai-interview-transcription/)<n>

Choices:  A: picnic B: friend's house C: table D: space shuttle E: fairgrounds<n><n>### Response:		<n>After you’ll get the answer in below, read the solution carefully to avoid similar mistakes.<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Based on context, I knew:<n>* They are planning on meeting somewhere<n>* He is bringing food<n>* They are meeting for the game!<n><n>So I knew to take a good look at the possibilities for "game" and "place where food". Here's the logical process I took.<n><n>First, I looked up the definitions of "picnic" and "table", since "table" was on the list, but not the answer.<n><n>1. Picnic -- Out-of-doors meal; originally served on a table, now (especially of large public ones) often served buffet-style<n>2. Table -- A flat horizontal surface fixed vertically upright at a height convenient for working at<n><n>Based on this look up, I knew that picnic could not be the right answer because it required a table. We eliminated it immediately.<n><n>Next, I reviewed the phrases: "space shuttle" and "friend's house". Based on their definitions, I knew that these were not plausible answers.<n><n>* Space Shuttle -- Aerospace vehicle designed to carry a spacecraft into low Earth orbit.<n>* Friend House -- House used for entertainment or pleasure; lodging and meals provided informally by a friend, relative, or other person<n><n>Space Shuttle is obviously not the right answer, and I have no connection to a friend whose house could host a game. Also eliminated.<n><n>Finally, we consider "fairground" and "food". As we look this up we note that "a fair is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities." This tells us they are meeting somewhere fun.<n><n>"Food" is a more difficult keyword to research, so let's keep it brief.<n><n>1. Food -- Any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink, or that plants absorb, and use as fuel. [syn. sustenance]<n><n>Sustenance makes sense on the body scale, but the clues don't offer up "food" with such a small scale. I would be surprised if the food they ate at this gathering were not eaten by hand. So I move past to the next

However, when the context of the conversation in the paragraph is considered, the conclusion is clear that the subject is talking about something they were fantasizing, or having good thoughts (during their drive to work. <n><n>2) The main text in the yellow box states that the subject was fantasizing, and the second part of the second sentence gives us an idea of  what the subject may be thinking about. As the phrase “pros and cons of” suggests a decision-making process, it’s likely the subject was fantasyzing about either receiving a promotion or getting a new position in the company.<n><n>3) The text seems to indicate that the “pros and cons” would be some extra responsibilities that were expected of this new position as indicated by the context of the conversation. The “pros” side of the coin, would likely be the benefits. The “promotion” choice in the answer choices most closely matches these clues, which supports the idea that the subject was fantasyizing about getting a promotion during their drive to work.<n><n>***<n># 📐📐Analysis:<n><n>#  1.

The question tells you that the person is scared of sky diving, even though they do it.<n>2. The question also tells you that even when they reached the jumping out point, they started losing consciousness and began yelling. You can infer that his friend pulled the parachute.<n>3. You can also infer that he died because the question says “he began losing consciousness WHILE he was playing uno.” This is not an example of “while he was playing uno” but because he lost consciousness, he would be playing uno.<n>4. The answer is D: Coma because this is what is likely when a person begins to lose consciousness but doesn’t die.

The context provided is a grassy field. A field could refer to any type of open area and doesn't specifically narrow the location, however, we are given the second part of the question, "the forrest." The second part gives us a specific context and leads us to conclude that the fox is likely to exist in the forrest. It would be unlikely for the fox to exist in both or anywhere else for that matter.<n><n>#### Based off our findings and answer choice letters E and A.<n>The forrest is not specific and the fox is likely there, but not tennessee.<n><n>#### E is the only choice not completely excluded by our findings.<n><n>### Input - What does the letter stand for - Choices -<n>	- A - Ankle to knee<n>	- B - Below knee<n>	- C - Calf -<n>	- D - Diaphragm<n><n>### Output - Which limb does a dancer stretch? -<n>	- A: Arm -<n><n>### Explanation (if necessary):<n>Dancer stretches their arm.

B: The phrase 'not every task' suggests that the person is unable to complete a series of tasks.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What would happen to a person if his or her money is stolen?

In other words, the action of theft is complete and leaves the victim with nothing they can say.<n><n>#### **This person would feel angry:**<n><n>The action of theft is often accompanied by a strong emotional reaction. The victim of theft may be devastated, frustrated, or angry.<n><n>#### **In this case, they would be drinking tea:**<n><n>The verb "to drink" suggests that the person is not hungry. Drinking tea indicates that the person may be thirsty or simply prefer tea over drinks like milk or water.<n><n>#### **A person would be crossing the street:**<n><n>In this case, the person would be crossing the road. The action of stepping or walking across the street indicates that the person's destination is on the other side of the street.<n><n>#### **The action of parking a vehicle would also be happening:**<n><n>Parking a vehicle is not directly related to this conversation. However, it does suggest that the person's location might be in a place where vehicles are parked.<n><n>### Input:(455675).

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint.

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What type of home is most likely to have an attic filled with historical items? Choices:  A: top of home B: older houses C: victorian house D: own home E: material<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is A: top of home.<n>### Rationales: <n>1. The word "home" refers to a house or dwelling, which means that we can eliminate choices B; C; and D. That leaves us with answer A: top of home as the only remaining plausible answer left.<n>2. An attic would be a logical place to store historical items, but only from houses that are old enough, and the choice implies that this is indeed the case. That leaves us with choice E: material, and indeed, a house filled with historical materials would fit neatly within the context of the prompt, and as such, is the correct answer.<n>Answer A<n><n>### Input:(a) What is the probability of picking a prime number in a single roll of a 6-sided die? Choices: 1: 1/7 2: 1/6 3: 1/5 4: 1/3 5: 1/2 Rationales:<n>1. The word choice "a" means that we are not given a specific example of picking a number in a six-sided die, and consequently cannot assume the die was used once. Therefore, we are likely to be presented with multiple dice roles or otherwise rolled numbers.<n>2. The choice "single roll of a 6 sided die" gives us further information about the die in that it is a 6-sde die and one role would likely be more than enough to answer this question.<n>3.  The answer would be a 1 or a 4 if we could pick the number after the die has been rolled once and we know what number we got from the dice.<n>4. There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 six-sided dice in total.<n>5. There 7 categories of options available; 2, 1, 5. <n>If you want to choose a prime number, you may have to roll the dice 5 times.<n>But if there are 5 categories of options available on the dice, the probability of the chosen category is 1/5.<n>Therefore, the probability of picking the prime number in the six-sided die: Choices: 1/144 (1/2*1/6) Which is 1/5*1/2.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:How is someone who loves their TV likely to feel about their remote?

Choices:  A: boredom B: patience C: time D: teachers E: inspiration<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><answer></answer><n><n>### Demystified:<n>To solve this problem, we need to interpret the question so that we are looking for a word that can be used to "instruct," or teach in a more general sense, rather than "instruct children attending school."<n><n>One way to do this is to focus on the word "properly." It is not clear whether simply instructing children attending school would be "proper," but the implication is that the answer needs to be something to "properly instruct." Once we have this clue, we need to narrow down the list of possibilities.<n><n>The first word our mind will jump to is "education," and while it is obvious that education is important when teaching, we need a more specific word than the root "educ-" can offer.<n><n>Another possible word is "instruction," as in "instruction manual." Although this is a useful hint, we can eliminate answers beginning with this word, as it is clear that they will not be specific enough to "properly" teach children.<n><n>We turn our attention to the word "children," which could narrow our guesses down to words that have something to do with childhood. However, just because the children are young does not mean that their needs are "childish," and the opposite might be true. We need to identify another clue that gives us more information.<n><n>From the first question's list of clues, we see that we were asked for a term to describe something that could be fantasized about while on a commute. One could easily fantasize about taking a promotion, but not necessarily about a boring or patience-testing job. This gives us a useful clue if we are looking for something that could be considered "desirable" or "good." We have an extra tip-off that it is something people can "consider," since we asked them to consider what they "deserved." This suggests that it will be positive, as in a reward.<n><n>We see that "inspiration" is a somewhat odd choice. We are talking about teaching children, and the word "inspiration" does not seem to necessarily dovetail with children. However, the word "inspire" is used to cause someone to become eager in one's presence, which could mean that when a child feels inspired by you, they are eager to receive instruction

In that way the dog has good protein which would help build its muscles.

Choices:  A: misfortune B: fearful C: criticism D: make mistakes E: promotion appraisal<n><n>### Response:		<n>If a boss is unhappy with an employee's job performance, the most common repercussions they are likely to incur are criticism or negative feedback (choice A), especially if the issue at hand is a severe or a more minor one. However, in order to keep things fair or to make it easier for the boss to correct the mistakes, the employee may be asked to correct them themselves.<n><n>Another option, while it is more unlikely, is making them repeat any training that they were unprepared for or failed during, in order to make themselves more capable (choice D).<n><n>If the boss is satisfied with the employee's performance, he or she may give them a raise or promotion (choice E), although it is more likely that the employees' salaries will be raised to keep up with inflation.<n><n>The final possibility for the boss' reaction is to give the employee a warning about their actions and to inform them that disciplinary measures will be taken if they do not improve (choice C). Although this is the most likely option, it is also the most vague since the boss could simply threaten to give that warning as a ploy to scare the employee into improving or it could be a bluff that they would later dismiss as no longer necessary.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>There are many options for how a boss could respond to an employee's poor output. However, the two most likely actions are either informing them that they must improve, or offering to assist them with their training or correcting any mistakes so they can do better on a future task.<n><n>### <n>

A house is an abstract concept here. Also, the sentence "It is easier for Americans to buy a house" is redundant.<n>       <n>       2) The fact that it is easier to buy more houses means it is easier to buy any house which is a logical absurdity. An American's house is a very important possession which no one will buy.<n><n>### Response 1<n>       <n><n>A: It is easier for Romanians, but not for Americans to buy a new house in the United State. In which case the statement is obviously false.<n>B: It's easier for Americans to buy houses than it is for Romanians. Again this is obviously false in that it doesn't matter which house is easier to buy.<n>C: It is easier for Americans to get a house on the housing market. Americans buy more houses per year so it is easier to find a place that is a reasonable price.<n>D: In places like the former USSR and Romania, it is easier for a person to buy a house. Many Americans can't afford a house in the states. There are more people trying to buy the same place than there are homes available.<n><n>###<n>Input: Choices:  A.

Choices:  A: orchestra B: school band C: music store D: opera house E: home<n><n>### Response:		<n>I would suggest that an orchestra is the best place to find bass clarinets to purchase from. Although there are multiple places one can find one of these, an orchestra is the one that provides the best selection of clarinet players. At an orchestra, one is not typically limited to one of those that would only be found in local high schools. In addition; I find that music stores have a limited number of those that a person would wish to purchase. Finally, there are no local opera houses to find a bass clarinet in the North, where there is a great deal of snow and the opera house season is usually closed during the winter months.<n><n>### Input : He's good at math and can solve how many times a month a leap year occurs?

Energy is a force that can be transformed into various forms, and energy storage devices need to be released in order to generate energy.<n>  2. The clue that energy would not mainly be generated in our muscles indicates that it will be generated in various forms rather than just physical energy.<n>  3. The sentence "released energy" suggests that we are looking for things that release energy rather than store energy (like a battery does).<n>  4. The correct answer must involve thinking instead of muscles, as we are talking about energy which manifests itself in various ways rather than being used for physical labor.<n>  5.

Choices:  A: accomplish B: learn about C: money D: notoriety E: religion<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The sentence "in order to make sure that everything has been told to everyone" suggests that there is a clear task/goal that is about to be carried out.<n>2. This goal is mentioned in the second sentence: "tell all the people about a new organisation", which is a clearly new-related statement.<n>3. This goal makes one of the following five possible answers reasonable:<n>    - If these people are all going to the same conference about a new business, organization, etc., it could be done to learn more about how it operates. This is unlikely though, so I'm going to rule this option out.<n>    - Another possibility is that this new business will receive a lot of free advertising. This is also unlikely, so let's cross it off.<n>    - This new business can be brought up at this same conference in order to potentially recruit new customers or staff. This is the first candidate that makes sense, so I'll put it down for now.<n>    - Other people might be approached to join this new organization as a member, so that the new organization could expand to a bigger size before doing anything else. This is definitely possible, but what the question says is that there will be plenty of people involved with this event, so they might already be members. I'll put this down as well.<n>    - The last, final candidate is that the people involved in this conference will be given some sort of promotion, such as a job, salary, etc. This is the only one I think will work, so I'll say that the goal of telling many of these people is to give someone a job or make sure they know about it.<n>    - And with that, I believe our goal is established: making someone know about a new organisation so someone can get a promotion. The answer is: A: accomplish.<n>Answer: A: accomplish<n>

Choices: A: relationship with no strings attached B: one that is over C: emotional D: abusive E: temporary<n>Rationales: The question asks what relationship is indicated by the use of the word "girlfriend" by a guy. Thus, the relationship must be the same as that of the girlfriend, which can be a girlfriend, wife, ex-girlfriend, ex-wife, etc.<n>The options are all grammatical constructs, so we need to deduce the type of relationship indicated by the use of a guy using the word "girlfriends." We can analyze each of the given answer choices in turn:<n>1. "Girlfriend with no strings attached" describes the type of girlfriend to whose relationships the man had no expectations or commitments, such as no strings attached girlfriends.<n>2. "One that is over" is an ambiguous phrase that can be referring to a one-sided relationship over, or the relationship is over.<n>3. "Emotional" is the description of the type of relationship that has emotional aspects to it, such as a romantic relationship.<n>4. "Abusive" is also ambiguous, but suggests a relationship with "strings attached", in this case to describe negative feelings that may be felt in such a relationship.<n>5. "temporary" is also ambiguous and can refer to either the duration of the relationship, or how the relationship feels.<n><n>Given this reasoning, the answer choice which provides the most information as to what the phrase "girlfriend" implies is "Emotional", option C: emotional, which describes a relationship in the context of which a man talks about having a girlfriend.<n>Answer: C: Emotional<n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What could be happening near you if the ground is getting wet? Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n><n>### Response:		<n>Most likely the ground is getting wet because it is raining or snowing, in which case this question is somewhat redundant. However, in other cases it possible that the ground underneath the subject is getting wet for another reason, such as water accumulating and dripping from the ground. In this situation the only choice that seems to make much sense is that the ground could be wet because it is melting, as a surface would have to be wet in order to collect water in large amounts. Hence that would be the only correct response. Answer: C: melting<n><n><n>### Input : What do you have to do in order to be able to get your money back?Choices: 1. F: get a receipt 2.

If you return the item to the same store then that store is sure that you are returning the same item, otherwise you might be mistaken for someone else stealing the item.<n><n>Answer : D: pay full price

According to the question, joggers are usually striving to achieve several things simultaneously, and some of them can be done without the others. For instance, while running, one may experience physical pleasure, but they may not be able to take deep breaths or run fast. Hence, the possible answers should not include any one of them, but should have a combination of the above things.<n>Therefore, the correct answer would be one that includes all three of the things that one can achieve by going jogging: feeling pride, getting tired and losing weight. B, C, E, fulfils these prerequisites. The only one that fulfils those requirements is B, C, E. This answer does not contain a single word that is mentioned on the question. Hence, this is the correct answer.<n>Answer: B, C, E<n>### Response:Earlier I said that I feel I could have more meaning in my career by switching fields.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>It is often said that we can achieve more success by switching fields.

It might seem good, but it might not be the best solution. It could be harder to switch fields into a new field and you might need to spend more time studying to get the same.

Choices:  A: desire B: spending money C: money D: needs E: time<n><n>### Response:		It is not necessary to have money before buying a product.<n><n>### Rationales: The question asks what is needed before buying products. We can conclude that this phrase refers to how a customer is expected or allowed to pay for the product, and this is often money.<n><n>Alternative interpretations include:<n>- The question asks what is required to have before buying a product, and this answer would refer to prerequisites for buying or what is needed before starting a project or task.<n>- The question asks with what should be bought products, e.g. before making a product purchase, and the answer refers to requirements for the product.<n><n>While any of these alternative interpretations might be true to some degree, the context suggests that it is talking about how payment for the product is made when buying.

Choices: 1. A: Similar 2. B: Each different 3. C: No need to have 4. D: Need to have 5. E: not <n><n>### Rationale: 1. The sentence uses a conditional that is commonly used to ask about hypothetical situations. That is, it assumes or postulates something about the world and asks if it is true. In this case, the postulate is that "all houses are similar but different."<n>2. It then goes on to ask about a purchase, with the word "make," the first syllabic clue that it is about buying a house.<n>3. We can analyze the condition, assuming the conclusion is false or that all houses are different:<n>- If all houses are different, the correct answer would be "needs to have" as all houses are different. The meaning would be "to be able to buy a house, you need to meet the requirements."<n>- If all houses were similar, the correct answer would instead be "no need to have,"

Choices:   * A: The factory  * B: The super market  * C: The garden  * D: The ecology  * E: The garage <n><n>### Response:"The garden"<n>The sentence states that we do not use resources if we implement eco-efficient and recycling operations, which is implemented in a garden.<n><n>### Input:`It can be done within six months.' `Choices:  * A: The factory * B: The supermarket * C: The garden * D: The ecological * E: The garages * <n><n>### Rationale:Answer: "The garden"<n>The statement tells us that gardening can be done within six hours.

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**1.** The phrase "could cause death" strongly hints that the answer should be an "all of the above" type. There is no other information provided to help us narrow this down; the problem, then, should be treated as an "all of the choices" type.<n><n>**2.** The question only mentions "stress," not a particular type of stress. Stress comes in many different forms and can have various effects on people.<n><n>**3.** The answer choices each have a distinct cause associated with stress. We should eliminate the answers that don't have a logical link to the cause of "stress."<n><n>**4.** One of the choices must be present in the question. This is a common tactic used to narrow down the answer choices.<n><n>The correct answer would be all of the choices, as the question makes no clear indication of which of these effects it is asking for (since this choice isn't even mentioned). This suggests that the choices should be grouped together with a "all of the choices," with the answers being "A", "B", "C", and "D".<n><n>Answer: A, B, C, D<n><n>### Instructions:Choose the letter of a possible correct answer (A, B, C, or D).

A house extension of a farmland implies that a yard in the farmland might be very small since farmland requires huge area then of a yard. I.e. a yard in a farmyard, or a yard in a garden would be big but not in the yard in a farm. But it is not true with a yard in a city and/ or a neighborhood.<n>2. Shade is not important in a yard. What is important in the yard is accessibility and the way it is used. However, in the case of the subdivision, the property size is crucial.<n>3. Conclusion: A yard in a farmland and/ or a neighborhood is tiny or small compared to a yard in a city, and/ or a subdivision. Hence, the correct choice would be,  'where might a yard be tiny is in a farmland or a neighborhood'.

Choices:  A: cabinet B: computer printer C: suitcase D: office supply store E: artist's studio<n><n>### Response:		<n>In the context of the question, the speaker is trying to describe something that is difficult to obtain or locate, in this case, paper that is large enough for poster creation. It is most likely that they are trying to find large poster paper, not just any paper that is large.<n><n>Analysis:<n>1. The context of the question implies that poster paper is desired. Given that the speaker's end goal is to locate a place where they can purchase large poster paper, the most likely location to find such paper is a large store that sells office supplies, not a suitcase.<n>2. Similarly, it is unlikely that one would buy large paper from their printer. The context of the entire question implies that poster paper purchased from an office supply store is the desired method of obtaining said paper, not buying the paper from their computer printer.<n>3. Although "artist's studio" is a valid option, it seems unlikely that the speaker is asking where one might buy large poster paper from the artist's studio. Most likely the speaker is looking to buy poster paper from an office supply store since they did not include this option. The answer to the question is C: office supply store.<n>Answer: C: office supply store<n><n>### Input : The best way to improve your golf swing would be by practicing with the following:  A: a heavy golf club when your hand grip is too strong B: a light golf club when your grip is too weak C: a shorter club or a club with less loft (slope) D: a club with a larger, thicker head when your swing is too long E: a club with a smaller, thinner head when your swing is inconsistent<n><n>### Response :<n>An expert in the game of golf makes a number of judgments about how to improve a person's swing: the amount of loft or slope in the club, the length of the swing, and the pressure applied to the grip.

This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: nature B: toilet C: computer science D: computer store E: human body<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The first word of the question, "Where", leads the reader to imagine a location or place. "Is a system" suggests a set or collection of many things, often electronics, as well as a structure, and further, the question explicitly identifies the topic as school.<n>2. The last word of the question, "...likely to be used," is often an adverbial phrase introducing an assumption about the topic. This gives us a hint towards the correct answer.<n>3. The answer choices are: "nature" suggests plants, animals, and the outdoors, "toilet" refers to a bathroom, "computer science" suggests computer programs or coding, and "computer store" refers to a shop. These choices may seem related to a school, but their specific wording and phrasing are not as obviously relevant as the others, and therefore are not the correct answer.<n>4.

It's an interesting question because, if it's sunny and the person's favorite weather is rainy, they may not feel as happy on a perfect day. So, it could be a way to say, "Oh, I have to hear the weather to know how happy I should be. I'm so indecisive." On the other hand, the weather could be sunny or rainy and it may not even matter to the person.

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What could you do if you want to listen to music?

Choices:  A: tide pool B: beach sand C: tidepools D: current E: cooking pot<n><n>### Response:		The answer is A: tide pool.<n><n>### Hint:To determine the answer, let's take into account the verb "was" and what sort of impact it has on the subject.<n><n>### If a verb is in the past tense but the subject is "the crab," then it cannot help but be true that 1. the crab is no longer in that state and 2. the event referred to in the sentence actually occurred. Now, let's look at another part of the sentence.<n><n>### The crab was scuttles... <n>We can deduce that the crab was already "strained" when he started to walk, since he is walking at all. However, this means the "scuttling" he was doing must have been impeded by something if he felt strained.<n><n>### Now let's look at our choices.<n><n>    - A: tidepool  <n>    - B: beach sand <n>    - C: tide pools <n>    - D: current  <n>    - E: cooking pot <n><n>### The first choice, tidepool, is most obviously incorrect, since the crab was "strained," indicating that he was walking and that whatever was impeding him must have been a source of strain. However, the second and third options are much more ambiguous. The second and third options are still clearly sources of strain, but we don't know if it was "tide pools" or "tidepools" that impeded the crab.<n><n>### Since there was obviously some impairing factor that impeded the clown, and we have only two remaining options that would qualify as "impeding" him, we determine that tide pools are the most appropriate answer.<n><n>### Input:/What was the cause of / Choices:  A. a / B. the / C. to / D. by E. of / <n><n>### Demostration:/What was the cause/<n><n>### Hints:Choices A and D are incorrect, while B and C are correct.

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What would you put in a container? Choices:  A: food B: cargo ship C: refrigerator D: closet garage E: port<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Given the phrase "put in a container," the context indicates that an item or collection of items is being transferred to another location. In this case, the items need to be contained, which implies the item will stay in the same context after the transfer occurs. A closet and port (dock) are not containers, while a refrigerator and cargo ship (ferry) are containers in the same context as the main sentence, so the answer is B: Cargo ship.

Just give a product to your customer with the promise to return it when he is dissatisfied. B: If everyone is satisfied, he can't accept a return. C: Most people just need more information about a product. D: They don't like to go to stores. E: They know how to buy a product better than you.<n><n>### Rationales<n>1. To start up a business, someone provides a product to their customer with the promise that the customer will be satisfied. If the customer is satisfied, the customer can not accept a return.<n><n>2. After someone buys a product, they usually want more information about the product. This would be true if the customers did not like to go to stores because most companies would not have enough people to sell products and most people know how to buy products.<n><n>### Solution<n>![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/7687/oqMN1J.jpg)<n>**Answer:**B: Most people don't like going to stores.

It is most obvious that some of her story would take place during the _ phase, as she'd be standing in _ of people. Based on the fact that she ____, this means that the performance took place ____, which is why the most logical and correct answer would be "when she began, she did which she ___, ___, _____, _____?"<n><n>The lady began the _ of her telling story __.

Choices:  C: bluetooth keyboard B: mouse E: speakers D: microphone A: USB to SD adpator<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>1. Laptop - A: The question starts with 'Which of the following  devices can you plug into....'<n>   This suggests that the devices are all those that can be plugged into some gadget, and are not necessarily limited to a particular device.<n>   A 'laptop' is a computer that is designed to be transported between multiple locations while being operated.<n><n>2. USB Connector - C: The keyword to pay attention to here is 'USB,' which stands for Universal Serial Bus and refers to a connector and/or a standard that allows for plug-and-play.<n>   Note that 'USB' could refer to both devices which are connected via USB and those that require a USB connector for operation, as well as software that utilizes USB.<n>   Also note that the question refers to "Charging." The device that requires charging must have a port that allows for the input of electrical energy and thereby be a charger. Devices such as keyboards, speakers and mice do not have charging ports or require additional accessories/software in order to work and thus cannot be used to charge a laptop with a USB to SD Adapter connected. Thus, option D is not applicable.<n>   Bluetooth Keyboards also require additional software in order to work in conjunction with a laptop, and furthermore the keyboard requires battery or USB power in order to function. Thus, option B cannot be right either.<n>   <n>3. Charging - D: All of the other devices listed in the question can be plugged into said device, and can be charged because they each have electrical devices within them that can receive power from external sources.<n>   <n>4.

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:James was cooking s stew in his apartment kitchen.  Where might he look for a potato. Choices:  A: restaurants B: casserole C: root cellar D: pockets E: pantry<n><n>### Response:		James has been cooking stew in his a kitchen. Rationales: 1: James is cooking stew in the kitchen means likely he won't be going out to purchase potatoes, or at least the potato that he uses will be at home.<n>2: If James is cooking stewd he probably isn't going to go out to stores or a restaurant to get potato<n>3: it would be safe to say that potato that James used would be from home and in no time. He would look in the kitchen and in the kitchen pantry.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:The sun was out and the temperature changing rapidly, it was really beginning to what? Choices:  A: drop to zero B: increase C: cool down D: dropping quickly E: heat up<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question tells us that the sun is out and temperature is changing. This suggests we need to infer as much information as we can from the clues provided in the question.<n><n>1. If it was beginning to be something, the subject of the sentence is talking about something that had already started, and had been continuing. If it was beginning in the sense mentioned for a long time, we could narrow our choices to "to drop to zero" or "to heat up."<n>2. The words "and" and "the" could refer to the things that were being described: sun and temperature, or the things that were happening: one of these was occurring, while the other "was beginning to."<n>3. We can narrow our choices down to "to heat up" and "to drop to zero," as each is logically related to the sun and temperature. There is no "dropping quickly," because "was beginning," along with the use of the verb "to be," indicates the process is taking place slowly, not that rapidly.<n>4. The only choice that fits those criteria is to heat up, so the correct answer is D; heat up.<n>Answer: D: heat up<n>

The most logical choice is A.<n><n>### Input : You got a new what? Choices: A: car B: dog C: cat D: fish E: vacation F: job<n>Rationales: The question clearly states what the recipient got so the only thing left to analyze is the word ‘you.’ The correct answer has to be something that the recipient has. The only thing that the recipients could be referring to is a vacation or a new job. The only thing that is singular and plural is the word ‘car.’ It would not be appropriate to say what the job got because the job is a noun. Hence, the correct choice is ‘F: job’.<n><n>### Response :<n>You got a new job.<n><n>### [Exercise 8.2](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-data-science/lessons/what-was-an-objective-reasoning-culture/exercise-answer-multiple-choice-question)

Choices:  A: farm B: ancient rome C: history book D: poor countries E: plantation<n><n>### Response:		<n>In response to the question, "What were southern institutions where African American slaves would do the labor called?," there is a possible response of "plantation." The word "plantation," or "P" for short, is a type of agricultural institution, which was used to describe the large farms where African-American slaves worked (Peterson, 2001).

Choices:  B: librarian C: teacher D: college student E: new teacher<n><n>### Response <n><n>In answer to the question, "Who is eloquent in speaking, but lacks experience in writing?" the correct answer is A. Liquor is a type of spirit, often associated with drinking and drunken parties, and A is also the first initial of Liquor. The use of the word "eloquent" to describe the speaker implies that they are proficient at speaking, or talking.

Choices:  A: meadow B: cupboard C: shed D: mail box E: cellar<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### Multiple-Choice:<n>I believe the best answer is (E) Cellar. <n><n>#### Explanation:<n>Given the following text, we can see that the question is asking us to find a word that means what you should avoid having if you are afraid of spiders. From the question we can see that the correct answer should not contain the word “Spiders”. There are two ways we can come up with a possible answer.<n><n>The first possibility is to eliminate the letters that mean spiders. (s)(p)(e)(r)(s)<n>From here, we can see that “cupboard” contains the shortest version of “spider” in it, and therefore, “cupboard” is an unlikely option. As for the other part of the question, cellar should be considered because it does not contain “spider” at the end of it.<n><n>However, this is just a rough solution. The more accurate solution is to consider the other part of the problem. The word “spider” should be found in the end. Thus, we can eliminate the option of having the word “spiders” in the middle of the letters. This eliminates the options “cellar”, “cupboard” and “mailbox”.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer and the most accurate answer would be “cellar”.<n><n>#### Free-Form:<n>I have chosen “cellar” as the best answer because I think it is the most accurate one.<n><n>I chose “cellar” because its meaning includes “a covered underground excavation for goods or refuse”. This part of the definition can help us to avoid having spiders due to “covered up” part of the sentence.<n><n>The other words are the wrong choices since spider and “mailbox” do not have something in common with “cellar”. “Cellar” is different than all of them because it does not have spider in it.<n><n>In conclusion, I believe that the correct answer is “cellar”.<n>

Efficiency B: 2. Health safety C: 3. Fairness<n><n>### Response：<n><n>Option 2 is the only choice that requires a consideration of health safety, or, alternatively, public health concerns. This suggests that the new policy should be based upon this criterion; hence, "2. Health safety" is the chosen option. Option 3. Fairness is less likely to be considered necessary for the purposes of the new policy, while option 1. Efficency is likely to be the primary aspect of the new policy, as efficiency is generally the key metric for most economic policy, and does not require a consideration of any other criteria. Thus, "1. Efficency" is the second choice.<n><n>### Option 1：The old policies was/were not good but the new policy was/were good<n><n>### Response :<n><n>For this question, the speaker has made the conclusion of "The old policy was not good" and then asks us questions on how to better the next policy.<n><n>The statement suggests that the old policy should not be followed and there should be changes made to it. So the conclusion that we can get is that all answers will be wrong answers.<n><n>However, since "the old policy was not good," this also suggests that the speaker has an idea about what should replace the current policy. Hence, it is possible that the speaker would prefer some of the answers to be incorrect.<n><n>Since there is a question mark with all the three answers, it is also probable that the speaker meant the statement as a way of asking for suggestions on how to make the new policy better.<n>Hence, the correct answer to this question is "B" which is "All". Since all the three answers, Option 1 to 3, might be correct and incorrect, the speaker might as well like all of the answers.<n>Answer: B.  All<n><n>### Input 3: When should you do tasks 1
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What is the opposite of hosting a crowd? Choices:  A: few people B: pay debts C: individual D: single person E: small group<n><n>### Response:		<n>The opposite of hosting as a group is hosting as an individual.<n><n>### Input:- Do you expect to be busy today.

For reasons mentioned previously, the phrase is missing at least part of the context to make sense. <n><n>The 3rd phrase "on one hand, this is good for the environment" is actually not related to anything said before. <n><n>The response does not make any logical links between the questions, the choices and the answer provided. <n><n>The only information given about correctness is a choice.

We'll start with an example question:<n><n>```<n>1. Which day of the week is today?<n>```<n><n>For this type of question, the correct answer is a noun phrase with which we can replace "is [today]?" as the predicate and with the subject "today" at the beginning of the phrase.<n><n>```<n>2. A: [Today] is Friday.<n>3. B: is [Today]?<n>```<n><n>In example 3 above, a correctly formed response would be "Today is Friday." In a question, we may assume these roles, substituting "means" for "is": <n>1. me is Friday<n>2. me means Friday<n><n>Our example would then become a correctly formed question:<n><n>``` <n>4. I am Friday?<n>```<n><n>You can test whether an example is a correctly formed question by checking that its predicate follows the syntax described for "I am [dayname]?" above. In our example case, the subject should be "today." <n><n>### Demo:<n><n>input: are you the boss?Choices:  A:yes B: I like your style C:I work late tonight D: I want to retire E: I can't come to work today<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: Where did you watch your favorite football game?

The word 'thing' is used to mean, ‘an object’.<n>5. The word 'busy' is used to mean something crowded, therefore, people may be having a conversation in a bus.<n>6.

See below.)<n><n>### Demostration:<n>- Clue : engage in chatting<n>- Clue 2 :necessity<n>Rationales: From the clue, the student is talking about a situation where the student is talking with someone other than herself and her choice of words suggests that she believes these conversations are a "necessity" or a "huge requirement." That is, she is obligated to have these conversations, which would only occur because she is in the presence of other people.

The phrase "where she would be slaughter soon" and "to the slaughter house" further supports this. <n>The word "farmer" is a hint that the animal did not "run away" as in C. <n>The words "wouldn't be slaughter soon", meaning that slaughtering was going to occur soon, further suggests that B is incorrect. The word "ranch" is a hint that there is not a large amount of animals around (E), like there may be at a dairy farm, or like at a slaughterhouse (D), where there may be other animals. <n>The wording "as a favor to the heifer", indicates that the heifer is important to the farmer, likely indicating a familiar relationship, which is indicated by the first clue as a "very compassionate" farmer.

One could further assume that the food court she owns is a successful business that could generate enough profit to enable her to live even more comfortably, and could allow her to be independent of any businesses that are not kashry-compliant or are not run by members of her religion. Given these factors, we can presume she lives outside of a heavily populated area since the food court she own would, if she were to buy it at all, would be a long drive away. We know this because she owns the business, but I do not believe this is important in answering the question.<n><n>The question also says that Lilly is not in Jerusalem, C, because Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.<n><n>The question further says that Lilly lives in a New York City-affiliated area but this does not mean that she is in New York City, since kashry is not an accepted practice in the city. If she were in New York City, she would be a kashry businesswoman, not a businesswoman who owns a kashry deli, and therefore the fact that she is not in Jerusalem does not disqualify her from being in New York City, for the purpose of this question.<n><n>According to these criteria, the only cities that could be relevant to the question, as far as I understand it, are New York City and New York City proper. For simplicity, I will refer to “New York City” as a synonym for “New York City Proper.” I will refer to everything outside of New York City as “outside of New York City.” Now that we have sorted out these details, let’s figure out where Lilly might reside.<n><n>One might guess that she lives in Jerusalem. Let us analyze this choice for a moment. <n>First, she does not. Since that she does not live in Jerusalem, that would automatically rule out her option C. Since she lives outside of New York City, it makes sense that she does not live near Jerusalem as well. Therefore she does not live in New York City proper. However, New York City is

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: math book B: phonebook C: statistic D: music school E: office<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationale: 1. There is some kind of association with numbers. This could also be in the form of maths, as there is a similarity in the terms in use, or another subject involving the usage of numbers, for example accounting.<n>2. Music could involve numbers in a more general sense, due to its relation to pitches, or the fact that there are so many albums. However, since there is a lack of evidence to support that this association should be considered, the answer should be rejected.<n>3. The last two clues could also not be used as support for the association. Office could mean that the association is work related, however it could also mean to do with admin. Therefore the answer can be rejected as another method of association with numbers. The next most logical option would be statics due to the similarity in the words.<n>4. With the evidence from the hints, it can be concluded that learning about operations with numbers is primarily done in a book. Since the context is about numbers, it is logical to assume that this book could be a maths book, and hence the correct answer is A: math book.<n>Answer: A: math book<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n>### Demonistration:<n>Input: What could I use my gift certificate for? Choices: A: rent B: food C: school supplies E: gasoline<n>Rationales:<n>1.The first word of the statement could be an indefinite pronoun indicating that the subject is in the context of an individual and not about the entire city.<n>2. The first clue, rent, suggests more of an item for a large establishment like a business or apartment complex, while at the same time not being used very often.<n>3. The second clue, food, while not uncommon in contextual sentences, could mean that the item is to be used for cooking and not for eating.<n>4. The third clue would have to do with educational purposes, and does not necessarily have to be school supplies.<n>5. The fourth clue could be interpreted as an item that is not a necessity for survival, such as a pair of nice shoes.<n>6. Combining the information from the question, the first two clues imply that the item is to use for rental, and the latter four clues imply that the subject is for an emergent purchase, thus the correct answer would be

Choices:  A: teach B: cost money C: do work D: be productive E: help people<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are many cubicles, so A: teach is wrong. As the question states, there are computers in each cubicle which makes B: cost money and C: do work wrong because computers cost money.<n>Therefore, D: be productive is correct.<n><n>### Input :This is a good system. What do the symbols on the system stand for? Choices:  a) S: Safety b) C: Customer c) F: Fun d) T: Time e) Q: Quality<n><n>### Response :<n>It is logical that the first letter of each word stands for Safety, because it ensures that you are not going to harm yourself. Customer, as that is the main purpose of the system is not correct, it is meant to keep the customer safe. Also, it is Fun because if you were not feeling safe, it would not be fun to play. Fun is not the correct answer.<n><n>Q: Quality can be correct, as fun can also stand for quality. However, the other words do not stand for what T: time is as time is not the main purpose of the game. Therefore, to get the correct answer to this question you must remember the first letter of each of the words on the system, and this makes it fun.<n><n>### Response to Instruction:<n>I can safely assume that the answer to this is 5. This is a multiple choice, which requires me to eliminate all options except the correct one. In order for a multiple choice question to have one right answer, there’s no options but the one, which means that there are 3 possibilities: A, C and E.<n><n>I believe that A and C are not the answer as they represent something opposite of the answer to the question.<n>E stands for everything, which is correct, but also represents everything, which is not correct (this is just another multiple choice question, not the best choice).<n>This leaves me with Answer B.<n><n>### Problem<n>It’s not only about the letter C but also the order of the word. In the first part of the sentence, the answer is not c as it was written: C: Customer. So I can safely assume that the order is meant to be: Customer.<n><n>### Output :<n>Answer for the output is C<n>

Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the provided clues. In your response, explain which part of the provided clues contributed to resolving the task and provide evidence of that.<n><n>> Demonstration: <n>><n>> To answer that clue, we can do 2 different things:<n>> 1) Try to figure out the object being talked about 2) Try to identify what star had or has 4 rocky planetes and 4 gaseus planetes in its orbit<n>> But to resolve the question, we need to know what kind of object was being talked about, not only the number of objects.<n>> Based on those two clues, the most likely object is a star. It is logical because if we had 4 gaseous and 4 rocky planes orbiting a star, that would mean that there are 4 planes at the same moment.<n>> So, the answer could either be the star or the planet itself, but we have a strong indication that it's the star. And this is because that the object that has 4 and 4 orbits is in the same line of the clue we have to solve.<n>> If we had 4 and 4 gases and 4 and 4 rocky on an object that's another, then it won't match with the same line of the instruction. This means that A: Hollywood and B: Night Sky (which are not likely to be an option, anyway) will be filtered because they talk about something else.<n>> Based on the clue and my deduction, I think that the answer is C: Constellation and D: Alien. E: it's likely an option because Constellations aren't limited to the number of planets. So in terms of that constellations have many planets. However, I chose to mark it as likely because they don't actually talk about the constellations but about their star that has 4 and multiple planets.<n>> I think this solution can be useful for solving more confusing instructions. Because we will likely have more clues, so instead of trying to deduce what those clues are all and then trying to find a solution, it's just more useful to just analyze the ones that are relevant and leave out the ones that are irrelevant to the task.<n>### 3

Choices:  A: ouch B: skip C: enjoyed D: awesome E: watch television<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Rationales:<n><n>2. The subject of the sentence "The children saw superman flying overhead," is in the "subjective" mood; hence the subject (children) saw superman fly.<n>3. The subject "The children" is "plural," which means 2 or more objects in a group, hence superman flew.<n>4. The predicate is "flying overhead." There is an "objective adjective" here (superman)<n><n>#### Solution<n><n>Due to context, we can eliminate choices A B and E. <n>Since superman (object in first sentence) is singular in the second sentence, it seems that choices C or D are the most viable options.<n><n>From the contexts, it seems that children didn't know that superman wasn't real. The children may have enjoyed that they saw a superman or even imagined the power of superman's. However, it seems more logical that the children would have been surprised to see superman and didn't know that they saw superman.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where should an excavation never take place? Choices:  A: construction site B: cemetary C: building D: city E: archeological site<n><n>### Response:		C: building<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>This task requires you to write a response that appropriately answers an ambiguous question from another text. It also can help improve your score in multiple-choice tasks.<n><n>### Rules:<n><n>In this task, the answer to the question lies somewhere _in the text you are being asked_.<n>The instruction will always ask you where the answer is located in the text.<n>The correct answer will always be found in the text, not outside it. **Do **NOT **go outside the text to search for answers!**<n><n>### In order to answer, you need to refer to the part in the text directly after the question is asked (the end of the question) and also refer to the beginning of the text after the question is asked. Refer to the full sentence in the question, and the full sentence in the answer. This will help you find the right location and also the right words.<n><n>### Examples:<n><n>Answer: E: archeological sites <n><n>### Demonsration:<n>Input: Where should the excavation never take places Choices: A: Construction site B: Cemetery C: Building D: City E: Archeological site<n><n>Output: The excavation should not take place in the city, since construction sites do not usually house large amounts of artifacts. This rules out A and D. There are some exceptions, but the most logical answer would still be that the excavation cannot take place in a city. For C: the question asks us to locate where the excavation should never take place, and a cemetery is only "never" a place for the excavation if it is a modern-day-one, which is not what the question asks about (for instance, one from ancient Rome), only if is a graveyard from modern times. In a cemetery from more ancient eras, one could certainly find artifacts and thus make an excavation. For B, the answer is never, though one could argue that the instructions were unclear and should have been "C: building should never be an excavation site", but that seems unlikely, since this instruction would not follow the rules set out above.<n><n>Hence, the most logical answer is that the archeology site (C) is the correct answer.<n><n>Answer: C: Archeological site.<n><n>###

Choices:  A: church B: theatre C: large city D: water fountain E: central park<n><n>### Response:		This question is somewhat ambiguous in its context clues.  Is the place located in the United States, or perhaps a particular country with a large population? Perhaps the "large city" refers to a single city with many citizens. Further clues that may help us determine the right answer would be, "water fountain," which could be found at a shopping mall, or "statue," which implies that the place in question may not be in a populated place, such as a theatre or a church. The question seems to suggest that the object in question is a public statute or sculpture of some sort in a large public area, such as a park.  The correct answer is A: church. <n>Answer: A: church <n><n>### Answer: A: church<n>

Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is D: his feet. The question suggests that the person is on the space station, looking down longingly on the surface of the earth. This indicates that the thing he is missing is likely something he had left back on the earth, rather than something he is expecting to get once he returns to Earth (e.g. a new house, promotion, or something else). Given this premise, only "his feet" is a suitable answer. As he was left on the space station, he must have left his feet behind. Hence, the correct choice is D: his feet."<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>The context of this example is that a computer-controlled chatbot has produced an ambiguous answer and an examiner wants to ask you a follow-up question. <n><n>In this example, if you had accepted this answer, your response (C) in the example above, the examiner would use one of the 4 provided feedback phrases as your feedback.

Choices:  A: department store B: school C: garden D: office building E: house<n><n>### Response:		<n>The clue "he left his shoes in the entry way" provides information that the subject of the question is most likely gone for the day and has left something in the entryway.<n>The question also includes the term "muddy shoes," which likely refers to outdoor shoes that may be muddy, suggesting that the subject left them some place outdoors.<n>We can therefore eliminate answer choices A, B, and E: "school," "house," and "garden" would not have entryways that a person would leave shoes in, or likely even shoes for that matter, and the phrase "muddy shoed" is somewhat ambiguous and could apply to any of the other locations given.<n>The question also mentions the fact that the shoes must be "some place out side", and that they are "muddy" and therefore were probably on the ground, not suspended over a water feature, suggesting that all of these answers might apply so long as the shoes were outdoors.<n>These hints suggest that the subject could be at "school" given that there is a "department store" within a "school", so the most logical answer choice would be D: "office building," which can house "office buildings" like a department store but also has multiple levels and thus may have a higher probability of "muddy shoelaces" hanging from a railing or protruding from a garbage can.<n>Answer: D: Office Building<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>### Demstration:<n>Input:"When they have finished their work, they will have earned their wage."

Choices:  A: cinema hall B: mall C: department store D: closet E: shop<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: A: cinema hall<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input:  The clothing was extremely expensive. The given phrase alone does not provide any information that would narrow down or localize the source of purchase, so we have several possible places, including the cinema, mall, department store, or closet, where the clothing could have been purchased.<n><n>However, what might be most logical would be to narrow down the possibilities based on the phrase "extremely expensive," since the adjective "extremely" tends to signify something that is quite expensive.<n>The given term could, for instance, be an expensive item of clothing worn to a movie premiere that was either bought at the theatre itself or is a souvenir purchased at the movie's location and brought along for others to see. For the same reason, clothes and accessories purchased at a luxury store could be considered "extremely expensive" as well, especially if the item in question was unique or otherwise stood out.<n>The answer that fits the context the most would therefore be "cinema hall," as the price of clothing at a movie premiere may be quite high. Aside from that, clothing bought as a souvenir at the location of a movie is commonly placed at a souvenir stores, which means that clothing may have been purchased at a mall or perhaps a department store, which is a more general, larger type of shopping center or mall.<n>These places might be called a "mall" or "department store," respectively. Clothing in a closet is obviously an incorrect answer, and "shop" could mean a small stand in a mall or other type of market place.<n>The given clues do not provide sufficient information to choose between these possibilities, so there is not a unique answer, though an appropriate answer. The possible answers include mall, department store and closet.<n><n>### Input;He was surprised that he became a teacher because he thought he was destined for something else.

E: None of the above, always assume that a website might be unsafe to use.<n>Rationales: The question asks us to identify what kinds of features might be used to determine the safety of websites.<n> - A: Trust your gut: This is a general guideline related to human behavior, rather than specific to websites, and it is not helpful. In fact, while humans are instinctively good in some ways, it is generally harmful to the self to "trust your gut" as a rule. It is better to consider each situation on a case-by-case basis and learn to distinguish between reliable sources and sources that might be malicious.<n> - B: Look closely: This is a potential indication that websites might be unsafe. However, there is no direct or conclusive reason listed here to prove it.<n> - C: Contact us page: A contact page is a potential indication of a legitimate website, which can be useful in determining whether or not a site is safe. However, the presence of a contact page alone cannot verify safety, as there are many fake websites whose contact pages are also fake.<n> - D: Domain name extension: The domain name extension (e.,g., ".com", ".org", etc.) is one of the most common ways to determine the safety or legitimacy of a website, and can be very helpful. However, it is not conclusive in itself, as there are sites that do not fulfill their domain name (e.g., someone might
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

The clue to the right of these is a shout at someone, which doesn't fit in the sequence. So our possible choices could be A: D.<n><n>### Output: The solution is A: D, but it could also be B: D (it should definitely end in D since that's the only "answer" left).<n>#### Reason:<n>A: D (feel happy, ship, happy, shout happy)<n>B: D (feel stupid, ship, stupid, shout stupid)

Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n><n>### Response:		Input tells us that they are talking about fish. They are not pets, so answers A and B are rejected. They do not "school together," so answers C and D are rejected. They would not "school" at all, which indicates that they are in school because that would make them school together. Fish do not breathe, so the answer is not E. If breath is excluded from the equation, that would mean that breathing occurs inside the fish. There are no such things as flying fish, so that would also make answer C incorrect.<n><n>Because the answer is not in the choices provided, the answer is unique.

Since the term consumption is not the same as food and since "lead to all sorts of problems" the answer should be some kind of beverage or drink. Water and liquid are used to wash, clean and rinse.

So if the sentence suggests one thing (going to the movies) and the details actually say another thing (playing cards with friends at a restaurant), then your response can still be true if it suggests playing cards with friends at a movie theater. However, don't misinterpret the information as much as what the problem suggests, or it might become difficult to find the right answer.<n><n>### Input<n>A: watch film - play card<n>B: play card - play chess<n>D: read news papers - surf net<n><n>If you watch a film, then how can you play cards with a friend?<n>

The word forgiving implies that someone is experiencing guilt or negative feelings for what they have done.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>In order to understand the question, one must recognize that there are 2 main categories of words within the question: verbs and nouns. The answer choices are the nouns, which must match up with whichever of the two verbs (have and receive) the answer is following. The first verb is "have", and the subject of the sentence is referring to themselves. When this fact is considered with the verb that is followed by "receive", the answer is revealed to be "great relief".<n><n>### Feedback and Self-Assessment:<n><n>- [ ] Whenever possible, try to determine the category of each word within the sentence. Here, "great" is a description word, and "relief" is a result of an action.<n>- [ ] A helpful strategy to remember the category of the word is to ask whether it is something you do ("verb") or receive ("noun").<n>- [ ] To determine the category of the verb you are using, determine the subject and the action of the verb. Here, the answer choices are nouns and the sentence starts with "if I have", which gives away that there is a "have" action and a "great" description being followed.<n>---<n>

Choices:  A: planet B: basin C: submarines D: earth E: pacific<n><n>### Response:		<n>The Atlantic Ocean is part of planet Earth.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The question specifically mentions "the Atlantic Ocean," rather than "a body of water named" or "a body of water," meaning that the correct answer must be the name of some planet/location. Although the question does not explicitly ask about planets, it seems unlikely that the question writer would mix the concepts of planet and basin.<n><n>### Input 2<n>How does Caleb get a promotion if his supervisor doesn't like him?

Let's say 100% is 1 and 0% is 0. 62% of number 1 = 0.62 x 1 = 68.3. So the number was 0.68 = 1/1.55 = 0.617.

He picked a place that was inexpensive and offered few luxuries.  Where might he be staying? Choices:  A: farm B: town C: city D: hotel E: motel<n><n>### Response:		<n>The person is staying in a motel. A motel is a basic, inexpensive place for travelers to stay, usually with a place to eat on the property.  A: farm is incorrect because although farms are generally affordable, they do not offer motel-type services such as lodging, meals, meeting rooms, etc.  B: town is incorrect because unless it is a rural area, town-level housing is not generally affordable.  C: city is incorrect because cities tend to be much more expensive than towns and farms.  D: hotel is incorrect because it is a more extravagant and expensive type of lodging; there are very few hotel types that will be as inexpensive as a motel or similar. <n><n>### Answer:C: motel<n><n><n>#### Hints:<n>1. farm: A farm would be inexpensive if you own the farm, but this seems to indicate that John is renting a room for the night.  <n>2. town: A town would be somewhere between a farm and a city in terms of cost.<n>3. city: a city is much more expensive as compared to a farm or town.<n>4. hotel: A hotel would be more expensive than a motel.<n><n>### Input:'I have a friend who thinks everything is over-priced, and that no matter what he might ever sell or buy in a store, he can always get it cheaper if he would only look hard enough.

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: persia B: table C: living room D: house E: desk<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input:The mother was worries, so she bought a rugs for under the what?   Choices:  A persia B: tablec C: living room D E: house D:desk   Rationales: 1 and 2:1. From the context of the question it's obvious that whatever the mother was looking for under the what could not be a "what" that would not be something that can fit under the what, as the question asks us exactly that. <n><n>### 2. "So" in the question in the previous sentence. The word "so" tells us that this was her response to the problems the rug would solve <n><n>###<n>Answer: D: desk<n><n>Explanation: 1. We know from the context that the question asks "which" "under the" the rug will be placed. In addition we also know it is a mother who is asking the question, as this can only be understood as a mother's worry in relation to the rug. Therefore, we can assume that this is not another rugs of other types, but rather it is a carpet for a desk. In relation to this piece of information, the carpet (rug) should have been bought for under something that would be a what (where the question asks). Since we know from the question what the rug is bought for; therefore, we know what the rug belongs to and the what that follows it. Answer: B: desk<n>

"Stand" and "walk" are both given and could be either verbs or nouns. We also know that the subject "he" can "run," which suggests that the subject can move quickly, or at least the ability to do so. Finally, we are given that "man tried to run, but could not" which strongly suggests that he was running at the beginning of the sentence and then was unable to continue when the problem occurs.<n><n>Since we have that information, we know that the only way that he could be "able to move" by "doing something" is by "walking quickly," or the closest option that is not a verb.

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:After bringing eggs home from the store in what are they held? Choices:  A: chicken coop B: supermarket C: box D: egg carton E: henhouse<n><n>### Response:		<n>This question was about eggs. Eggs are commonly sold in egg cartons, which are therefore the correct answer. However, given how many possible answers there are, the context was ambiguous. <n>The context of this question is in what was the eggs held. We could answer this question with several answers that the answer is A: Chicken coop. But since the question was answered with one choice, The answer was A: Egg carton.<n>#### Note:<n>Chicken coop is the name of a place where Chickens live, where they hold the chickens, a carton is where they hold the eggs, this is shown in the picture.<n><n>----<n><n>### Input:- When he was in the third grade, he learned to draw, but by-third grade, he couldn’t really draw very well.

Now to the rest of the question we were focusing on. He was the best at when in third grade. Which means he can't draw he wasn't the best at drawing in third grade. Because in the last question he knew to but couldn't. So choice 5 was the correct answer.

Choices:  A: sanded B: composted C: warp D: hardened E: petrify<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this case, the answer can be deduced from the context of the problem. The question is specifically about a wood that became fossilized, providing us with a substantial hint as to the "ti" that the paleontologists will find. This indicates that the "ti" is probably something related to wood or trees. Thus, the correct response would be A: sanded.<n><n>### Input A.What does the word “un-” mean in this word?

Rationales: 1. Fans are human, the band and their fans cannot love the start of other concert 2. The rest can be classified as fans and their loved ones, the answer must always be the thing that would love in order for the crowd to go mad, so the crowding must go mad for the band's success. 3. The answer must be a word that is not known before. So the correct answer is A: The band enjoyed their success and loved to hear crowd go <n><n><n><n>

Write a response that expresses your gratitude.<n><n>### Response<n>My heartfelt thanks are offered to you for your friendship and contribution to the superhero community during the duration of your illness. I wish you a swift recovery in your recovery treatment.<n><n>### Context: The superhero industry is facing numerous challenges, not the least of which is the rising rates of superpowers. With a terminal illness, the president struggles to perform his duties as a superhero, which is a contributing factor to the industry facing challenges. This is the reason for your writing your gratitude.<n>### Input<n>I can use my time to build something awesome while you recover.<n><n>### Demo<n>The subject is saying they will devote their time to improving their skills as a developer for you while they are ill. This makes sense for a variety of reasons:<n>    - When one is sick, he or she has a lot of free time that can be spent on personal projects. This would be particularly so in the case of someone like the superhero franchise president, who may have more free time due to a decline in superhero activity.<n>    - As the subject is a developer, it would make sense for them to use their free time to improve their skills and knowledge. There are few better ways to do that than through personal projects, which are also often enjoyable and cathartic.<n>    - The subject also expresses that their time will be spent building something "awesome," referring to the personal project they are working on. This could be anything from a side app, to a video game, to a novel they have always wanted to write. Whatever it is, it demonstrates a commitment to self-improvement over the illness, and a level of enthusiasm that indicates they will be a great partner to work with.<n><n>### The best place to purchase barbeq<n>

And it is not necessary to have theater to express art, we are not theatrical art because they are just something like people who make art.<n><n>### Input 2<n><n>### Demostration<n><n>Input:When something is easy?<n>Rationales: This question requires you to evaluate whether there is any contradiction in the text, or if there is a statement of fact without any evidence. Considering the fact that the question asks _"when"_ (when the question is asked), it is safe to assume that the information given refers to how a person thinks or what they believe.<n>1. The word "easy" could mean "fruitful" or "pleasant" (in terms of experience), or that the task itself can be finished in a short time without much difficulty. <n>    - There is _some_ evidence within the text, as someone mentions "the last week", indicating the current week, implying that whatever the task is, they will complete it soon.<n>    - However, the word "easy" also doesn't necessarily mean "simple", and the phrase "last week" is vague about the nature and type of work. Considering these, the only sentence where the word "easy' occurs is "It is easy for me to do it in less than an hour." and it makes _no_ sense. <n>    - This is because the sentence directly states that "he" (in this case, the subject himself) is able to finish the work in less than an hour, which would contradict the subject's mention of doing it in _last week_.<n>2. As mentioned before, the answer chosen must be a statement of fact or a statement that is _not_ in contradiction with stated information.<n>    - The subject only mentions that they "want" to do it soon, although they are not actively doing it in the present time.<n>    - There are no _explicit_ instructions about how to do the task, but only a statement of intent. <n>    - So, we have to eliminate every choice that involves _work_ which does not seem to fit the context.<n>

This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:The person turned the oven on and put a pizza in, what happened one hour later? Choices:  A: smell smoke B: catch cold C: burnt D: look angry E: bank savings<n><n>### Response:		<n>We can use various strategies to answer the question. In my case I used the method of elimination:<n><n>1. Exclude the choice 'A.' An oven cannot catch cold.<n>2. Exclude the choice D. Oven and pizza cannot make someone look angry or disgusted.<n>3. Exclude the choice B. Cooking food could result in smell, catching cold, or burnt, but it would not result in savings, which makes choice B impossible.<n>4. Choice C fits the pattern. In a sense, we all know that cooking an item in the oven and not burning it will result in tasty, or in some other cases in healthy, food. Hence, choice C is the correct answer.<n>### Input:What does the word on the right side of this word ladle in this picture represent? Choice: A: toast B: pancake C: steak D: sausage E: pizza F: egg<n><n>### Response<n>Inspecting the options given, the correct choice would be A: toast. While option F: egg could also be the right one, here the question explicitly states that the right word is Ladle. This would only fit the context if the ladle held something that was toasted. Hence, the correct choice would have to be A: toast or B: pancake.<n>The picture in the question illustrates that our character is handling a ladle, which, as per the dictionary, is a serving spoon with a broad flat bowl and high sides.  However, we can look deeper and answer the question based on what is actually illustrated in the picture (which is a ladle):<n>> The illustration in the picture shows the bottom of a ladle and what it is resting on: a platter filled with pancakes and toast piled high on each other.<n>> Hence, our character is holding a ladle; however its bottom is resting on a platter on which pancakes are placed. So, option A: toast is the correct choice; it makes the most sense in the context based on the illustration. <n><n>### Inputs: Which one of the following two statements must be true in order to answer the question? Choice: A. 71.76 cm<n>B. 64.25 cm C. 7

He didn't heave anything to put it on, and he lacked the what to balance it? Choices:  A: tenacity B: hands C: coaster D: skill E: breaking<n><n>### Response:		<n>This response was correct.<n><n>Rationales:   <n>- It doesn't actually state what he picks up to put the cup down on, in addition to that the answer doesn't matter<n>- A cup doesn't necessarily need balance to be used, so "what" is really what he needs to pick up to place the cup down on.<n>- You can heave objects so that isn't the right answer.<n>- "Tenacity is the ability to remain committed to achieving a goal, regardless of challenges, failures, or the opinions of others."- Google.<n>- Breaking is the answer, since the man didn't bother to pick up anything to put the cup on.<n>- Coasters are needed if you are carrying a cup while walking. It would be weird to carry a cup and still use a coaster.

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:You might head to the locker room after getting a green drink here. Choices:  A: health club B: jocks C: fitness centre D: stadium E: gymnasium<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this example, the instruction does not specify what question the narrative is trying to answer. Thus, we first need to rephrase the question into an answerable question that fits the instruction and topic. For instance, we might ask: "Which of these institutions would be a good place to buy a beverage?" While this is still quite vague, it indicates our intent to answer the question "where to buy" rather than "where to get". We could narrow it even further by asking: "What would you get at one of these 'X'?" It's still not exactly an answer to the original question, but at least we can parse it to the meaningful question: "where to buy?"<n>Next, the phrase "here" also gives us a hint about the answer. There are only two places referenced in the sentence that "here" is located -- a green drink and the locker room. This rules out the stadium and gym choices, as both are places to work out and thus outside the realm of the answer, a beverage. Fitness centres provide gym memberships and exercise classes, both of which presuppose that the answer is some form of a workout -- not something to eat after a workout. This leaves us finally with the jocks and health club as choices. Neither choice is too far from the literal answer, but the context suggests something a bit more low-key and non-athletic, probably indicating a club of some sort. This leaves the option of the health club. The options in the multiple choice answer are in fact all clubs that serve beverages, but this is not a valid answer for this problem. The health club is indeed a club that offers services and membership, the most common of which is a health and wellness membership. This is the closest answer that would fit.<n>Answer: Choice C: "health" or "fitness" club<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>**1.

(to shop)<n><n>###  What to do:<n><n>#### Solution:<n>The first part of the problem involves determining the correct synonyms and antonyms. The antonyms are easier to determine, as we can see that the phrase "to buy" is reversed in the phrase "to shop." Using this logic as a guide, we can deduce that the antonym to buy would be despise. We also know that the answer should be an adjective, as the phrase is "to buy," implying that a noun would not make sense. Given these pieces of information, the correct antonym choice would be "buy."<n><n>Likewise, the first and last letters of the phrase, "sho," spell the noun "shop," as well, further narrowing down which synonym would fit best. The word "impurity" comes out as a fit, due to its opposite, "purity," and its meaning, as it is not pure, indicating that the impurity must be used instead of

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: one material often recycled B: ripped C: saturated with water D: one dimensional E: crumpled<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: B: ripped<n><n>### Justification:<n>" What **could** happen **to** a paper **if** you leave it outside even **if** it does not move?"<n>It's important to notice the order of events in the question. In this particular case, there's no way to tell from the question alone **if** you leave a paper outside **if** it does move. One solution is to use the following logical reasoning:<n>- **What could happen.** The question asks "what could happen," which could mean some possibilities are possible and not that they will happen.<n>- **to a paper if you** The phrase "to a paper" clearly distinguishes between a paper and other materials, suggesting that something happens to the paper.<n>- **leave it outside.** The phrase "leave it outside" refers to an outside, which is not restricted to a location, but can refer to nature. This is crucial in identifying the potential cause of the problem, which is the weather conditions;<n>- **even if it doesn't move.** Lastly, the phrase "if it doesn't move" suggests that the paper does in fact move, and this movement is the cause of its rip. Hence, the correct choice for this sentence is D: ripped.<n><n>Answer: D: ripped <n>

The sentence "even in a full immersion" is the beginning of the sentence that describes why learning a foreign language is difficult. There is a lot of important information in this sentence.

Choices:  A: apply for job B: stand in line C: take care of proposals D: pass course E: play the lottery<n><n>### Response:		In order to earn money, a person must either have a job or make an investment, which will either fail or pay off.

Working a job would allow them to spend time being productive and earn an income, as opposed to having little activity and only spending time on unproductive tasks.<n><n>Taking care of proposals or passing courses may not help you financially, as they do not generate immediate income and may actually cost you money in some cases (e.g. tuition/class fees).

The question tells that the subject had once made the cut and had been rejected. That's why she has the figurative scars indicating that she has been rejected for years.<n>2. As rejection means a person has failed to make the grade, so is putting together. This is also logical and correct as the statement says that "its figurative scars would NEVER WHAT... heal. Therefore, the scars are still fresh and the person will never heal it. In conclusion, the appropriate answer is B: put together.<n><n>### Input:$10 for our local, not so local. and was the cost of his local, not so local what?

The question states  that $10 for their local, not so local was too expensive. This indicates that the amount is too expensive to enjoy the food they serve i.e. $10 for their food is too expensive.<n>2. Moreover, the statement also said that it was not so local. This clearly means that the person expects higher-quality food but the seller is giving them food of average or lower quality. This clearly means that they are overcharging the people.

Choices:  A: tennis racket B: skill C: competition D: tennis court E: legs<n><n>### Response:		<n>This is a rather easy one. You can choose to play tennis if you have enough time.<n>If you want to be good at tennis, I guess that you should put the most effort on training.<n><n>Sometimes you need to be good at competition in order to show your performance.<n><n>If you dont know how to play tennis, you need to learn more by learning how to read the court, and having a coach.<n><n>### Input:"A tennis game consists of 2 sets. Each set consists of 6 games. In a game, each player gets 4 tennis serves. The players alternate services every other game. The serve must be between the outer lines in the box drawn. The box is 21 feet long. If the server misses the box, the ball must be replayed. <n>In a game, if the score is 6-6, 7 points must be won by either player to win the game. A game can be won by 2 different things: 1: If one player has 2 points more than the other and there are at least 2 points remaining to win one game. 1: If one had 2 points more than any other for the game and had to win 2 more points, then he won the game" Choices:  A;B C;D D;E E;F<n>Rationales: A & C: If one player has to play two different games and one player has 2 pts more for the game and needs to win 2 more pts to end up 2 pts more than any other player for the game then that player should win the game. This can only happen when both the players score 6-6 in each set. If each player has 21 games, then both players will have 42 games scored. If one player has 44 and the other player has 42 then that player will have 2 pts more and should win the game. To win a game you have to go 2 by 2. Example 21-27, 27-21, 21-15, 15-15. Both players will get 2 pts in their favour for their sets. So now this time it depends upon the second set. If both set goes down to 6-6 then they both are going to score 6 pts on their side, so the

Choices:  A: united states B: sky C: court D: field of flowers E: orchard<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A bee would have to gather a lot of food in one day to maintain itself and its family, so where are these food sources found? Aside from orchards, bees can find a variety of food sources. They could go to united states, the sky, court, or the field of flowers.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>Roses are generally flowering from spring through the end of fall, so bees would be common in the field of flowers during that time. The apple tree would still be flowering, so there would be less pollen there than in an orchard. However, an apple tree is known for having nectar, and nectar is high in fructose which is necessary to prevent the bee from starving.  Bee colonies have been reported from sky, which is common of a pollen-bearing flower such as orchids. Bee-pollinating flowers commonly grow on trees, in court, and other open spaces around the United States, which makes it an attractive gathering place for bees.<n><n>An orchard also is a common source of food and nectar for bees. Honey comes from the nectar, which is also produced by the plant. Insecticides commonly kill bees and harm their colonies, which makes orchards more attractive, even if it is not the source of food for bees themselves.<n>

He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n><n>### Response:		Demonstration:<n>The wording of the sentence is key. John is punching the wall but he is only bloodying his knucels. His knucels are injured, not his hostility or his anger. John probably holds his tools with his hands and if he injured them with too much force, he would not be able to use them anymore. So the correct answer is hands and it is answer E. Hands are physical things and can be injured so it is the only choice that makes sense.<n><n>### Input:"Do you want to go to the movies, honey?

So in that situation, he may be more likely to want to express <n>                    that he is carefree, in a good mood and unconcerned with external appearances, and that would most likely take the form of more informal or even messy <n>                    grooming than in a more formal situation. <n>                    </ul><br><n>                Thus, in the first kind of interview, the appropriate answer would be B: looking good.<n>            </ol><br><n>            In the second kind of interview, the choice would be C: handsomeness.<n>```<n><n>### Inputs:<n><br><n>#### Answer:<n><p style='margin-left:-60px'><n>1.

First sentence: "if you want to make a splash in a river" : " splash" means the ripple or sound created by hitting the water.<n>2. The second sentence:" rock, from where should......" indicates that the writer wants make a big splash on the river with a rock which mean this situation is similar to " hit on the water". Therefore, we can refer to the following rules to solve it:<n><n>The height of ripple on the water will be affected by two factors, " distance and speed". Therefore, the greater the distance and speed, the greater the ripple.<n>> From equation (16.3): r=V2dV=ρVv(4)<n><n>Hence, in order to make a big splass in a rivers or lake, throw away from the near side or the opposite side is the best choice, that means the best place for you is B: ground or the mountain.<n>C and D means near and the opposite side which can not make a big splash as the distance and speed are too low and the height of ripple will not be the largest.<n>E and A are meaningless, we can know from above equations, the " height of ripple" and the " height of splash" both have a inverse ratio to it.

There is one answer choice that is a proper noun (opera, in this case), which is extremely unlikely to fit. Of those that are more general, the choice that makes the least sense is building. No one is likely to search for food in a building unless they were a janitor or an employee of this building. Apartments are where people live (including opera singers).

Choices:  A: home B: hardware store C: home D: hot room E: office<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Answer:<n>The correct answer would be "D--hot room." Why this one? We can see that the word "cool" indicates a preference for low temperatures. Moreover, as far as one knows from the information in the question, this individual would have "more than one electric fan," strongly suggesting that this person owns more than one fan. In fact, given the clues, the answer must be "D: hot room. This choice is unambiguously correct.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The word "if" in the prompt suggests that this is a statement about a hypothetical situation. Given the hypothetical situation described in the prompt, the question asks about something that has never actually happened, but is likely to.<n>2. The word "likes" indicates that some particular attribute of the situation (i.e., temperatures) is desirable in some sense.<n>3. The phrase "more than one electric Fan" is a clear indication that the individual referred to in the prompt owns more than one Fan. Given the hypothetal situation, the question is only appropriate if the individual referred to also "has" electric fans. This means that the phrasing "has" is more suitable than "has owned" -- not only because the word "owned" infers a past-tense situation, but also because the context would never indicate that the fan ownership happened more than once--it is an ongoing possession. Hence, the choice that is most suitable would be "has," as well as "Fan."<n>4. The word "hot" indicates a preference for high temperatures -- it is the antonym of "cool" and also the most likely direction that someone referred to in the prompt would like temperatures.<n>5. As for the choice of "hot" we know that this person is likely to keep at least one Fan hot, as they like high temperatures. But we have no information beyond this to determine which room they have their fans in.<n>

As a couple who was dating, John and Jane likely did not use a row as a form of long-term communication.<n><n>### Input:-1.  The people at the party were bored. 2. It was hard in the beginning, but they started learning 3. By the end, they felt more confident. 4. She took a class to learn a new hobby. 5. There were many other similar parties.<n><n>### Response:-1. The people at the party felt bored, because the party was boring; they were not bored in the beginning, but rather, the beginning of the party was difficult, but they felt more and more confident as they learnt more and more.<n><n>### The person in the photograph has what color hair and eyes?<n><n>### Input The two boys had blonde hair and blue eyes.

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What do you get for not moving your car during the required time?

Choices:  A: buying B: purchase C: overpriced D: way to much E: expensive<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The clue word 'usually' narrows the choice between A and B. There are four answers to choose from. Only B & D are in the form of a sentence. We can eliminate choices A & C since A doesn't say 'usually bought.' 'Usual' can mean typical. B can indicate typicality. 'Way to much' has a very wide range of meaning.<n><n>Answer: B: buying<n><n>### Instructions: In our daily lives, we use many different ways of writing. One of these ways is writing essays. Writing an essay requires us to do many different things, such as think about an idea, gather information, or state an opinion and then defend this opinion, all in a logical and cohesive manner. However many of us may never need to write an academic essay. Now, imagine you are going to give a speech of at least five minutes to a class of 100 students. If you were to write out this speech on a single sheet of paper, it would be:<n><n>\begin{blockquote}<n><n>"Greetings Ladies and Gentleman! Today, I would like to share with you the power of positive thinking. Did you know that a little over a decade ago, people didn't think positively? They couldn't even think positively, as it was actually difficult for them to do. But nowadays, nearly every person in the world is positively inclined. But did you know that a little under half of the world’s citizens are very positively oriented? But there is positive thinking and positive thinking, and we must be clear on this as positive thinking is the only way forward."<n>\end{blockquote}<n><n>You may find that this passage is somewhat confusing as it doesn't make direct sense. Now, imagine we had to write a one paragraph essay that could only contain one single sentence (the above sentences were all the first sentence of each paragraph). We would be forced to write out each sentence of the speech on a single sheet. Would you be able to write the speech in a way that's not too confusing for everyone to understand?<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>This should be obvious, but you can't write out something in a single sentence. Here is the correct version of the passage, which you should be able to write much more easily. The first (and only sentence) paragraph now

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where are people likely to stand at an intersection? Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n><n>### Response:		The question is asking about where people are "likely to stand" at an intersection, indicating that this is behavior you would see in the population. "Cars" and "city street" both indicate traffic lanes. "City street" even seems to imply intersections or junctions, which indicates that people will be standing by the side of the road or by intersections. Both "cars" and "city streets," however, are very general terms, and are somewhat broader than what is required.<n><n>This leaves two options that can be narrowed further based on the clues in the question: city street intersections/junctions and corner of street junctions. This would bring our focus to "street corner" and "fork in road," although it's not certain which of these is narrower in meaning, both of which are narrower than what is asked for "at an intersection."<n><n>Finally, we have the two remaining choices: "street corner" seems to be the narrower of the two, and indicates that people are likely to be standing either at the four-way intersection or at an actual corner of streets. "Fork in road" seems to imply that people will be standing either at the three- or four-way intersection, or maybe at an otherwise isolated fork (this one is more likely a nonword). However, this choice has the more unusual implication of a different setting than expected. So, the conclusion is that the most precise answer is B: corner of street junction.<n><n>Answer: B: corners of street junctions<n><n>### Input:"That's not my problem." It has three times.

However, the latter makes no logical sense, as it would not have any significance.<n><n>The question tells us that the person has responded to someone stating that this is their problem with "That's not my question." In this response, we can also identify that this person does not accept responsibility for the problem, or wants to

I just needed to understand the context first, then I looked at each choice and tried to figure out what best fits into the situation. The context is the driver of my answer.

I could easily have guessed one of the answer if the clue were not given, just like the clues I have mentioned above. I still didn't understand why the answers could not be the opposite. It's my fault, I haven't known how does it works. I'm a good listener and my teacher taught me to pay more attention. After this day, I've been listening to other people's story carefully.

Therefore, I started thinking of all the possible answers on the road and found the correct answer by looking at the question one more time.

He had the same love for all humans.<n>5. He loved every single human. I think the hippies had a strong bladder for everyone<n>6. He was strong for each person. His strong feeling was not for specific people (like one specific gender, one specific group) he was not biased. He truly wanted peace and wanted love in the same aspect for everyone because I think he wanted it for one reason: love. I think he was strong and he had feelings. He cared about humans so I think that is why he was having this dream that he thought was going to change the world.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What will telling many people about an embarrassing situation lead to? Choices:  A: notoriety B: emotional distress C: riot D: bad dreams E: annoyance<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question asks for the effect telling many people about an unfortunate event will have on the person. Possible answers include notoriety, emotional distress, riot, bad dreams, and annoyance. There are, however, several factors that differentiate the correct answer from the rest.<n><n>First, notice when answering questions from a magazine or newspaper, the author usually describes the correct answer, which in this case is "annoyance." The question is then often followed by "true or false?" There are several "true or false?" questions that ask us to identify what something will lead to. If we want to be correct, we just have to describe what the author says will happen.<n><n>### Input:"Tell Many People" is a response to how a lot of people will learn about an embarrassing incident which __________. Choices:  A Annoyance B Notoriety C Emotional distress D Bad dreams<n><n>### Response<n>When the author writes “tell many people,” they want us to name what the speaker would cause. “Annoyance,” not “emotional distress,” is the correct answer. “Annoy many people” is the second part of the sentence, but even if there is some overlap between “many people” and “many people,” the focus of the first part is “tell many people.” This question can be solved using the same process as the earlier question.<n><n>## Conclusion<n>The first part of the article is not very helpful as it contains little information and no specific question. Because the second half explains the purpose of questioning and gives us a hint about how the question is structured, we can use this guidance to understand the format.<n><n>### Reference<n><n>https://labs.openplacementtests.com/article?pid=3<n>

Choices:  A: bike B: downtown C: building D: tool storage E: car<n><n>### Response:		<n>The subject wants a garage to store whatever the first letter corresponds to, or at least that's what the context suggests. It likely means that the something is going to be costly if not purchased or maintained, because they used the word "costly" in regards to the word "bike". There is little mention of the second word (downtown, building, tool storage, car), so it's likely those objects aren't significant and only play a minor role in the narrative. <n><n>Answer:  A: bi

Choices:  A: bookstore B: house C: race track D: friend's house E: building<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**Hints:** 1. The question is about where you would sit in a chair to be able to watch four-leg animals that are completing a race.<n>2. Choices C and D are both incorrect. If you sit in a chair, then you are not looking at four-legged animals while they are completing a race, because two-legged humans do not count.<n>3. Choices A and C both refer to animals that have four legs. Choice E refers to a building. Since the phrase "four-legged animals" is in the context of the question, then by rule, Choice E is not a possible answer.<n>4. Choices A and B refer to friends, so they cannot be the correct answer.<n>5. By the process of elimination, then the possible answers are reduced to the remaining two, and the only answer that fits is B: house.<n><n>### Answer:  B: house<n><n>### Input : Your friend just received a package in the mail from a company that made its own movie, but they don't have a homeowners insurance and it is covered from thunderstorm, earthquake, or fire? Choices:  Your local movie company and the company that made them send movie. I do not own one.<n><n>### Response<n><n>1. The subject has just received a package in a thunderstorm, and we learn this from the phrase "in the mail from a thunderstorm."<n><n>### Hints<n><n>1. We know that it was received in a thunderstoron, and one cannot expect thunderstorms to cover insurance, so Choice A is not correct.<n>2. Choice B is incorrect for the same reason.<n>3. Choice C is incorrect as the phrase "own a homeownes insurance" refers to it being insurance for the home you own.<n>4. Choice E could be a correct answer except that it is impossible to have "own" and "not own" at the same time, so Choice E is eliminated.<n>5. Choice D is incorrect because the statement "it is covered from thunder storm, earth quake, or fire" tells us that at least one of them covers thunder storms, so if it is not covered then the only possible answer is Choice D: all.

Choices:  A: communication B: suffering C: pain D: laughter E: embarrassment<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The answer is **D** because they are embarrassed.<n><n>### Clarification:<n>The question states that "people expressing themselves" are expressing their emotions through various "acts of expression." These are the types of expressions that are part of everyday life and can include gestures or actions.<n><n>The question details the specific actions that the people are expressing and the specific emotion that they're expressing. The question specifically states that their emotions are based on their _actions_, which implies that their emotions are an immediate and involuntary response to a situation, rather than being a planned response or a result of prior actions. Hence, the answers to the question are all immediate emotions, such as surprise, embarrassment, or fear.<n><n>In this case, the question details the _specific_ actions of a person, a person "trip[ping] in front of a crowd" and hurting themselves in an action that is highly embarrassing. The person is embarrassed. The person is not "tripping" due to communication, but rather due to the action of tripping in front of a crowd. The person is not suffering or in pain, as the person is not suffering from any disease or ailment. Therefore, the correct answer is "D" - they are embarrassed, not suffering from pain.<n>Answer: D: Embarrassment<n><n>## Example Inputs:<n>Below is an example of a completed Instruction.

Choices:  A: happiness B: pleasure C: happy D: grief E: isolation<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The correct answer is C: happy. <n>2. You can determine the answer choice by analyzing the clues given in this passage. <n>3. Analysis:<n><n>```<n>The clue in the question is "asks a husband to stop being[sic] married to her," which means that the husband can be asked by his wife either to stop being married to them or to stop loving her.<n><n>In turn, the clue in the passage is "he likely to feel even with[sic] friends," which means that the person in the passage can feel joy with strangers or other people that he/she is not related to.<n><n>Therefore, the most logical answer is that the husband will feel happy with his friends, because he/she is happy with strangers.<n>```<n><n><n><n>#### Explanation:<n>1. The clue in the question is "(sic) married to her," which is an informal contraction of "married to her," where the "(sic)" tells the reader that it is a mistake in the original text. <n>   This means that the "married to her" was not supposed to be in italics, but simply added in through punctuation or formatting. In the original text, it would not be in italics. <n>2. The clue in the passage is "(sic) with friends," which is an inform that informs us that these characters/words are not capitalized in the original text. In the original text we would not see anything written in the same way ("with friends"). <n>3. Now, we can determine that the most logical answer is C: happy, because "even with friends" refers to strangers, and "husband" refers to himself and not to other husbands that he could talk to while traveling for work. <n>4. The most formal, correct answer is (sic) C, because the most common way of saying it would be "he will be happy with his friends." The only part of this passage that is incorrect is the parenthetical. <n><n><n>### Output:<n>1.

We have to find out what would be the best alternative for the teacher to change the learning process for someone.<n>* Rational explanation: The question mentions'someone', it could be two, two thousand, or even two million. We don't know if the class is small or a large student body. This means that what the student wants might be different to the rest of the class. So the teacher cannot make changes for everyone. It is more effective if the teacher can find the most common answers, the learning process would be the best for the most number of people. So, the teacher can change the learning process by making it interesting.<n>* Support by evidence: This supports the conclusion by stating that the most common answer is an interesting learning experience. This means that this would be the best alternative as it is the most common answer. It would also be the best alternative if the person who does not like learning is the only one in the class. Also, if someone is only interested in the lessons, the teacher can make the lessons more interesting. This means that it would be more beneficial if the student finds the lessons more interesting than learning lessons.<n><n>I can show this evidence by citing what I think is the best evidence.<n>Evidence A: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/science/pandemic-learning-online.html?referringSource=articleShare<n>Evidence B: https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020... /https://kidsdoc.com/... 79a45f9be1b?utm_source=newsletter... /<n>Evidence C: https://www.sbs.com.au/gameshow/shocking-reasons-why... /shocking-... ys...<n><n><n>

"Separate Things" is the complete opposite of "go on vacation" so that can be removed. "Cross Street" is not even relevant since there aren't any streets in a plane or a hotel.

Choices:  A: kitchen B: child's hand C: street D: toy store E: soccer game<n><n>### Response:		<n>There is a good chance that someone would say [get toy.] for all of his/her previous answers, it is more likely than not that he/she was thinking of 'a' 'ball' as the indefinite noun. The word 'game' is ambiguous; 'a' 'game' could be used as a synonym for'sports' or 'a''sports' could be used to specify 'a soccer game', which is not a good place to get what. But 'where' is not ambiguous, given that all of the previous answers were in places.

Choices:  A: bus stop B: street corner C: roadblock D: fast food drive thru E: city<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: Option B: Street corner.<n><n>### Justification:<n>The best way to figure out what the instructions are asking for is to eliminate each choice in turn. First, no place mentioned is a bus stop, so if the people are indeed lined up next to a location, that location was not a bus stop. Next, we can eliminate D: fast food drivethru; although places to get food are often located near the road, this location would not serve to signal traffic through roadblocks, and would not be in a "line" (i.e. there is no straight line that joins each point). The same could be argued for E: City. Although cities have citizens that stand in a "line" or "formation", cities are generally much larger and more widespread than a single street corner, making it difficult to determine if "people" are standing in a "line" there.<n><n>### The remaining choices are fairly logical. A: a single "line" of people on a bus stop is not a useful tool for regulating a road (there is probably too much disunity to cause any noticeable effect), or even the flow of people on the street itself; and B: a street corner has at very least two points in a straight line and two "lines" of people.

The question asks for appliances that commonly use water and soap, and the answer must be a specific type of appliance, not an abstract object or concept (e.g., a shuttle doesn't use water or soap). Moreover, the clue "space shuttle" is a negative answer in this context and helps to eliminate other possibilities (namely that the answer is an appliance used outside of the home).<n>2. The only answer choice that could use both water and soap is the "washing machine," which is a household appliance. Hence, the correct choice is A: washing machine.<n>Answer: A: washing machine<n>

Choices:  A: bowl of soup B: serving dish C: table setting D: placemat E: glass of iced tea<n><n>### Response:		<n>## Input: A bowl is a type of container where liquids, food, and other ingredients are kept before use. Liquids and food ingredients may also be kept within the bowl of a serving dish. If such a bowl contained liquids or food ingredients, a spoon may very well be placed on the serving dish, for the purpose of placing the ingredient in the bowl or adding additional ingredient to it. A serving dish usually contains liquid ingredients or food ingredients. These ingredients may be added to or placed on a plate. If a spoon were placed on a serving dish, it would either be within a liquid or food ingredient container, or on a container such as a liquid or food ingriedent container. Therefor it may also be placed on a plate to be used for both. A spoon may be placed on a placemat to be used for food and other ingredients before being placed in the bowl, it may also be placed there before being placed on a plate. Lastly, a spoon is often placed in an iced tea to add sugar to the tea. Hence, the best answer would be A: the bowl of the soup.<n>##<n>## Instruction:A question:  What’s one of the two essential things that you need to have in order to know anything?<n><n>## Demonstration: <n>1. The two essential things are mind and body, this is the point of the question. The next three choices are in fact body, mind, and heart. It's pretty clear at this point that the answer is "Mind."<n><n>2. The other three choices are, as always in the textbook, completely irrelevant. "Dreams" have no relationship to having a body, "the Earth" also has nothing to do with it, and then "the Universe" refers to the whole world. This question is ridiculous.<n>##<n>## Rationales:<n>1. Question: What’s one of two essential things that you have to have in order to go anywhere in life?<n>  - Essential, important<n>2. Dreams, The Earth, <n>  - Have nothing to do with "going anywhere in life", and also having to do with your life.<n>  - "Dreams for going somewhere" and "to go somewhere"
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What does a virus primarily do to a person? Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n><n>### Response:		<n>A person contracts a virus via direct contact with an infected person or object, or by exposure to contaminated people or objects. A virus cannot reproduce, mutate, eat food, or make computer malfunctions on their own and would have no reason to do so given what the question is asking.<n><n>### What does a cold feel like? Choices: 		 	A: A person will notice their nose running 	 		 B: A person will notice that their temperature is rising 	 		 C: A person notices a throbbing headache 		 	D: A person has no symptoms 		 	E: A cough is prominent but not the only symptom<n><n>### Rationale:<n>What do you understand the word symptom to mean as used by the writer of this problem?<n>1. It must be something that can be detected or seen because of the question, "What does the word symptom mean as used by the author?"<n>2. To the right of the word symptom, the next word is "to," which means that the symptom must have to do with the person who is sick.<n>3. To the right of symptom the next word is "cold," which means that this symptom would describe the cold.<n>4. To the right of cold is the word "feel," which means that the person has to feel as the symptom.<n>5. In the answer choices, cold cannot give you a rising temperature, nor is cold a throbbing head, nor is it a cough. Only feeling a cold is a possibility, and it is also the only answer left.<n>Answer: E: A cold feels like a cough is prominent but is not the only symptom.<n><n>### Input:"Wet" is an adjective meaning _______. Choices:"  A: "something is wet"    B: "wet is a noun"    "C:"wet" is an adverb "D:""wet is a verb"    "E:""wet is an adjective"<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The word "something" would be a noun and the word "wet" a verb in that sentence. A person, place, or thing is wet, so it can be a noun.<n>2. In the answer choices there is

Choices:  A: bee hive B: england C: castle D: deck of cards E: chess game<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The queen is the most powerful piece in chess, so a chess game without a queen is not always a chess game.<n><n>Another example of how context can determine whether the answer is correct or not is the following:<n><n>Instruction:<n><n>What is the only country that is represented by a pineapple?<n><n>Input:<n><n>Answer:<n><n>Hungary, even though Budapest is actually a grape leaf.<n><n>Demonstration:<n><n>If you had seen these clues, you may have thought that, because Australia has a kangaroo for its mascot, it would be correct. The problem here is that the question is referring not to the country’s mascot for sporting events, but to its national symbol. According to this criterion, only New Zealand has a kiwi for its national symbol and is therefore the only country that is not represented by a pine apple.<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>Even though, the context clues have nothing to do with the answer, it still does not make sense. <n>The queen is the only piece that is equal to a king and its presence makes a board game not a game anymore.<n>

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n><n>### Response:		<n>One place that is not interesting to children is __________.<n><n>### Rationales: 1: the most reasonable choice would be to select between 'Toy Store' and 'School'.<n><n>### The question's first part describes children's activity(going out, and doing whatever they want), when they are in school, then suddenly after answering "What place is not interesting for children?" the other parts of the question are about the interesting places to kids.<n><n>### The second part of the question is : "the most reasonable choice would be...", which implies that the answer, "Classroom," does not satisfy the reasonable part, hence it should be chosen.<n><n>### Input:"__________ are very important, because that is what gives meaning to our lives. Choices:  A. love B. money C. success D. career E. family<n><n>### Response:"_________" are very interesting, because it's the only topic which we can't stop talking about.<n><n>### Rationale:The question is about 'what is important in our lives',  so I have to talk about what is important in our lives. What is what is important to me in my life? It's my career and my family. That is what is important to all of us. We spend most of our life doing something to support. Our family, we need money for food and to pay bills. and our life is what we do. We are talking about life when it's important, So what is important to me.

Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer will be A: swim.<n><n>### Rationales: 1) The question states that the subject is wanting to get in shape. This means that it is not a necessity to exercise and suggests that the subject can be picky on what type of exercise to do.<n>2) The options do not mention the subject having any other way to get any shape or muscles. The subject has been using other alternatives such as jogging or excercising. These options imply that the subject has a form of exercise at hand. <n>3) The options do not tell the subject that the subject has an alternative form of exercise. They ask the subject is there is no land nearby. This shows that the subject does not have access to land, that means that the subject is forced to look for other alternatives. The subject will be forced into exercising or into eating the same amount of calories.<n>4) The answer choices that the subject can do can be done anywhere so long as there is enough space to do it. The subject also already has experience doing this kind of activity, this makes this kind of exercise easier and effective for the subject to do.<n><n>Hence, the subject may start swimming to maintain the shape that he was used to.<n><n>Answer: A: swim

If I have 60 pages to go then I need to solve 60 plus one problem per page.<n><n>### Output: The number of questions is not equal to its opposite. To get to the solution, one must write a sentence of the following form and change it so that it reads as it should. For example: I found a book about a book called "Amazon.com". I found a book called "Amazingly, I am the one with the problem. <n><n>### Input1: When I was a high school student, I was quite smart.

This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

When the question is said it is also obvious that we are in the past so it is safe to assume that the subject is talking from the past/memory perspective (i.e. the past). By the end of his/her response the subject realizes the picture he/she likes is not the best, but the best picture is another one ("I believe"), and for a different reason which he/she does not mention. <n><n>## Task: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>* Which of the following photographs and what do they have in common?<n><n>* They were taken a long time ago.<n><n>* They are of two different members of the subject's family.<n><n>* They contain water.<n><n>* They have a special emotional significance.<n><n>* They were not chosen for the exhibition.<n><n>* A: None of the above.<n><n>## Task: Write a response that appropriatly completes the request.

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Lindy was a senior.  He lived with his children because he didn't want to go where? Choices:  A: republican party B: old people's home C: office D: park E: high school or college<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: The clues in the sentence indicate that Lindy had multiple children, which leaves us with two possible explanations for why he lives with them: either he had been widowed and now lives with his children or he has a shared custody agreement with his ex-wife. Since the sentence mentions that Lindy lived with his children, he obviously doesn't live with his ex-wifet, meaning he most likely lost a spouse. This means that the answer must be A: republican party. The sentence does mention that Lindy did not want to live with old people, and also says that where he lived used to be a good place to live, so this indicates that the place where he lived was very different from how it is now. This can be deduced from the next sentence in the sentence: It wasn't as great as it once used to be. This all points to a likely scenario, in which Lindy's spouse passes away and he eventually moves back into their old home. However, it now becomes a retirement home, which leads him not to want to live there anymore. This means that the correct answer is A: republican party<n><n>### Input : What had to have been done to get them to work more? Choices:  The problem needed to have solved so that people could get on with their lives. A: The solution to the problems needed to have happened. B: The correct problem needed to have been solved. C: The problems needed to have been fixed. D: The problems needed to be solved. E: The problem needed to have been corrected.<n><n>### Response :<n><n>The question is very specific. The text states that the problem needed to get solved. Thus, we cannot choose option A or C. Option B does not say the right problem had to get solved. Option D does not actually say the problem needed to get fixed, which could be a solution of the problem. Option E says the problem needed to be corrected. However, this would indicate that the problem needs to be fixed, which was not mentioned by the text to be a requirement.<n><n>### Final Output :<n><n>###  Answer : The answer is C.<n><n>###  Explain:<n><n>The fact that the text stated that The problem needed to get solved, clearly indicates choice C as a viable answer.

Choices:  A: to be heard B: receive gifts C: understand themselves D: good things in life E: acknowledgment<n><n>### Response:		 The task is asking us to find the answer to "Why might a person go *to* counseling?" So we can rule out any reasons why a person *might go* counseling that pertain to a person getting counseling at home or through self-help materials. So we can rule out A: to be heard (since they could just do it at home), B: receive gifts (since they could just receive gifts through a trusted friend), C: understand themselves (since they don't need to go to counseling to understand themselves), and D: good things in their lives. Answer should be E: acknowledge, as it states a potential benefit of counseling.<n><n>### Input Choices:<n>[1] Find a new job.<n>[2] Buy a new car.<n>[3] Buy a new computer.<n>[4] Enjoy a break from work.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The task is clearly asking for something that the subject enjoys, not something that will be good for them at work. So we can rule [1] out because that pertains to work and [3] since work isn't the "enjoyment" this is asking for. [4] is most relevant to what we are asked however it isn't a benefit to them, only that they enjoy it, so it doesn't answer the question. Answer is 2: Buy a new car because that's what they like, not necessarily what is better<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the questions below.  Each question has two statements.

Choices:  A: being happy B: glee C: smoke D: stress relief E: may laugh<n><n>### Response:		<n>This question is a little ambiguous (as it asks what someone might do to have fun, but then lists several activities and says they will do one of them). The context of the question might be interpreted to imply that one of the answer choices is a correct interpretation of the first half.<n><n>Since the clues provided are so sparse and vague, I will provide both interpretations, one with what could be interpreted as the intended answer, and one with several of the other answer choices:<n><n>### Interpretation 1:<n>The activity of having fun is simply being happy. The answer is A: "being happy", because the activity is the act of being fun.<n><n>### Interpertation 2:<n>The answer could be that someone who is having fun might do any of the given activities. The correct answer is "C: smoke". This is because, while having fun, the activity (the word "fun" being a noun), could also be defined as the word "smoking" (as having fun often involves doing or being something, and can therefore be defined as the activity). A close second would be "D: stress relief", but an activity is not a noun, and therefore cannot be fun.<n><n>##### Input:I want my children to understand that everyone’s different from each other, and that they should appreciate such differences. To this end, I always have them play the same activity as their peers. What kind of game should I choose? Choices: 1: Ping pong. 2: Chess 3: Football 4: Golf 5: Tennis.<n><n>### Response<n><n>I'm not sure the question makes sense. The answer choices are all types of sports. If the question were "What kind of game should I play with them?", then it would make more sense as this list of games would indeed be related. However, they seem to be the correct games to play if you want to make them understand that everyone is different from each other and that they should appreciate it. I'm not sure why we would have to play the same game, as our children would be having fun by playing a different game each time.<n><n>There is no way to answer this question.<n><n><n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What chore might a child have to do after breakfast, before getting on the bus?

Choices:  A: raise corn B: seed plants C: grow plants D: seed crops E: farm land<n><n>### Response:		<n>For this problem, the question asks us to analyze a sequence of sentences. Here is the sequence we need to analyze:<n><n>"The farmer chose plants…he only planted… seed crops."<n><n>We see that the farmer "chose plants," which suggests he chose which crops to grow. Based on this, we can rule out "raising corn" and "growing plants" as possibilities.<n><n>We then deduce that the farmer chose to grow only those crops that could "be used again the next year," or in other words, that could be reseeded. Based on that fact, we can rule out all possible answers except D: "seed crops."<n><n>It turns out, however, what the question actually expects us to say is "seed plants," because "seed crop" could refer to animals (e.g., crop of seeds, seed crop of chickens), whereas "seed plant" is more specific to food crops. Though this answer is technically "wrong," the instructions only require us to "answer the question," and hence the correct (but counterintuitive) answer to what was asked is "seed plants."<n>Answer: D: Seed plants<n>

She doesn't hate her, which indicates that she wants to have a new girlfriend.<n>  3. She doesn't dislike having a party. She doesn't feel too good to sleep which means that she isn't tired.<n>  4. She doesn't like dancing with her boyfriend since she wants to have his drink alone.<n>  5. She prefers to have drinks alone.<n>Therefore, the correct answer would be C: she hates him new girlfriend.

Choices:  A: istanbul B: animal C: antique shop D: human being E: bedroom<n><n>### Response:		Sarah opened her chest and found a? Choices: A:) second heart B: second heart C: human being D: human being E:) human being<n>### Answer: B) Sarah opened her chest or found a second heart? <n>### Rationales: The text states that "Sarah opened her chest and..." this leaves two meanings for "her chest", namely her heart and her own chest, the patient is not the one who opened his chest. Therefore, I'll eliminate A,B. <n>The text states that Sarah opened her chest, therefore, it can only mean that she is not a patient, because a patient cannot open her chest. Therefore, we are left with 2 possibilities: Sarah is not a human being or a patient. The patient is "her patient" or is the patient herself and thus the last option is ruled out. Therefore the correct answer is D:) human being.<n><n>### Input:- A: B:<n>The text says "he fantasised about a" (emphasis added).<n>### Demon:<n>The underlined verb "about" does not need an object and hence the answer does not include such an object.<n><n>### The correct Answer is A:<n><n>### Input：The patient has a high chance of which?

Choices:  A: drill B: learn C: require obedience D: understand E: spoon<n><n>### Response:		Master carpenters use drills to put holes in objects.<n><n>### Analysis:<n>The first line starts with a question phrase "What does a master carpentier use to put holes in object" that is in the form of "what" for a reason. The phrase means a master carpenter (also known as a "master") needs a tool (a "tool") to put holes in objects (i.e., in objects). Thus, we can conclude the correct answer is "A: drill".<n><n>### Examine this question in detail, including a description of the input and output and the methods used<n><n>The first sentence has no punctuation, and thus requires context to be determined as a question or statement, which is the most obvious method provided in the question as an example.<n><n>The key word used to mark the beginning of the question is "What":<n><n>What does a master carpreter use to put holes in the material?<n><n>If this were a statement, its meaning would be similar to "A master carpeter puts holes in material by using a drill"<n><n>When we analyze this question with regards to the instructions, it is immediately obvious that the correct answer to: <n>"What does a master carpeer use to put holes in material?" must be an answer such as "a drill", which is in line with the instructions. Thus, the correct answer is "a drill".<n><n>#### Input: <n>In the sentence "John will buy me shoes", how can "me" be inferred to mean John's sister?<n>Choices:  A: by possessive modifier B: by possessive determinator C: by intransitive verb D: none of the above<n><n>#### Analysis:<n>In English, "his" and "my" both mean belonging to the subject of the sentence. For example, "his house" means the "house belonging to him" or "his sister house" means "the house that belongs to John's sister." However, if John says, "his house," which means John's house, but if John says, "my sister's house," then this means John's sister's house. This is because of the context of the sentence in which John is speaking to a person other than John's sister and is trying to tell them that he doesn't want to take his sister shopping.<n>

"C" and "E" are the only options which are in fact items. The answer is "D.".

Choices :  A: weak heart B: overweight C: weak lungs D: heart damage E: strong feet<n><n>### Rationales:<n>- 1. The problem states that somebody has a murmur. That implies that he has had a heart murmur ever since he was born (otherwise he would not have been born with it).<n>- 2. The context is not really a specific part of the body (at least it is not stated that it is), therefore the words with the opposite meaning, which are feet, do not make sense.<n>- 3. It cannot be weak lungs, as this is related to difficulty breathing and it only makes sense for the patient if he was not born with the condition in the current shape but suffered from it.<n>- 4. The same goes for strong feet since it makes no sense in the context.<n>- 5. The fact that he has a heart murmur could possibly mean that he was born with congenital abnormalities or with a heart defect.<n>- 6. Since he was born with these it means that he has damaged heart.<n><n>### Answer: D: heart damage.<n><n>### Input:: After 24 days in hospital it turns out that all patients healed completely.

Write a response that completes the request. I'm going to try to put myself back into a place that is so long ago that I might not even remember it. I can remember a time when I went over and above the call of duty but not all the time and it still affected people (as I mentioned in the first step). In many ways it's easier to do things out of duty, rather than because it requires effort from you as a person. The reward of accomplishing things with little hassle is far greater than the effort. I could try and look at the time I went out of my way to help somebody but I wouldn't be able to answer the question truthfully. I can't find a better word in my mind other than "effort" because it is a type or effort. A time when I did work out of my way and it was the right thing to do. In my workplace, I have recently been given the task of finding the cause of what are called "customer complaints." Now in customer service I'm not sure of the actual cause of many complaints and I'm sure there's some but what that means is that most complaints are not in my area of responsibly and are handled by different people and that's fine by me. It's their job and my job is to do what I'm asked and try my best. The number of complaints is rising but it makes me realize who we're getting these complaints from (which is the people I work for). At first, it just seemed like that was what needed to happen and I knew there were problems but I wasn't sure what to do about it, that until I was given this new task in my job to deal with the customer complaints that I had the responsibility for. So, when I read this it has triggered a memory in my mind and I've been reading about why things aren't getting done and why it's happening? I've been reading the complaints and I've been talking with my supervisor. This was not a single incident (although it was a few days later that something happened to me in my own life

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:After attending school for twelve years what do you do? Choices:  A: inspiration B: much work C: boredom D: graduate E: degree<n><n>### Response:		In answer to the question, I had to graduate high school and then move on to college. If all goes well, I might just graduate in 2010.<n><n>### Justification:<n><n>1. We can tell from "attending school for twelve years" that my answer has something to do with education. The next clue we come across is the phrase "do you do?" - this suggests that there is a question behind the question, since if it simply stated "After attending school for 12 years, what to go?" then there would be no need to ask "do it" as the answer of "go" would be implicit. The fact that there is a question hidden in the question itself provides an additional clue about my future plans and possible answer choices - "after graduation, I will have (the potential of) many future possibilities and opportunities available to me, and this question is asking about what I shall ultimately pursue." This helps narrow down the possible answer selection to the choices A or B.<n>2. Having selected one answer choice from among A or B, we analyze the remaining answer options and eliminate those that we do not consider logical or suitable. For example, the choice C cannot be eliminated since we are thinking on a more theoretical level (that of possibilities) and have already established that our answer choices can either include a job (A for inspiration) or a degree (B for graduation). Furthermore, we can logically eliminate C as it makes little sense to assume that our answer could be "boredom" since boredom is not a tangible, future-oriented result of completing school, as neither "inspiration" nor "graduation" are either.<n>3. Eliminating C, we may now decide on the remaining answer choice, of which we may choose one that matches most closely any relevant personal experience. We are likely to have experienced both "boredom" and "graduation," and although there is little experience relating to "inspiration," it can be said that it is possible that graduating from school could spark an inspiration to do something. For the other two answers, choosing a more specific answer may seem more realistic than choosing an answer that may potentially be too implied to be considered as a result of completing school. Hence, A: inspiration is the most realistic answer choice for the remaining choices.<n>4. The final step is to check whether the

Choices:  A: classroom B: synagogue C: bathroom D: front porch E: grocery store<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: B: synagogue.<n>Based on the context, a "morning paper" is referred to as "the newspaper you get in the morning" or something like that.<n>The answer to our problem would then be some place where newspapers are delivered early in the morning. I would reason that synagogues are also known places to study in and are places where someone would expect to find a newspaper. A classroom would be an unlikely choice because it sounds like a school. Bathrooms are out of the question. A front porch would be a nice choice unless the newspaper is dropped off on a mailbox, which I don't believe is the case. The grocery store would not be likely unless the newspaper was purchased there. The grocery could be referring to a grocery that has subscriptions to the news or something like that. Also, it is unlikely that a daily newspaper is purchased at a grocery store.<n>Thus, based on the context of a synagogue, synagogue is the correct answer.<n>Answer: B<n><n>### Instructions:Complete the question below.<n><n>### Rationale: The question was regarding a person's childhood. Hence, the child, his teacher, and the family name sounded like they were from the same region of the country. By inference, the family name sounded Eastern European. Thus, the only countries we can think of are "Russia," "Ukraine," and "Poland." However, we cannot think of any Eastern European country that has a tradition of a child being named by their teacher because of how common the tradition is in England and Wales. Also, the question stated that this was an English teacher. Therefore, we are left only with two countries and no countries. Thus, our only logical choice is Ukraine.<n><n>Answer: B: Ukraine<n><n>### Input:"Let's go over to this building and then we leave with the cake and eat it together!"

This cheerfulness turned off people who expected the funeral to be what? Choices:  A: solemn B: compete C: serious D: somber E: straightforward<n><n>### Response:		<n>To begin with, Shanes actions indicate that he is very outgoing and expressive.  He is likely a good public speaker given his profession but he is doing so on a somber occasion.  This act of cheerfulness is likely to turn people off since they are already grieving the loss of a loved one.  If there is to be joy or happiness at a funeral, it should be from those attending and not from the speaker.  The answer that would be most commonly thought is solemn.

The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits.

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:George ruined the surprise.  How did he do so? Choices:  A: hiding B: accidentally C: expectation D: knowingly E: planned<n><n>### Response:		<n>As George ruined the surprise, George is the one who "hid" or concealed it, and must have "hidden" it accidentally or purposely. Since intention comes to question when George "hid" the surprise, George is accused of "knowingly" ruining the surprise. He must have intentionally ruined the surprise from the minute the surprise was told to him about, which comes after the time that he "hid" the gift. Knowing beforehand that a surprise will be given and hiding it in your own way is equivalent to "planning" it's ruin, so George had planned to ruin the surprise the moment he "hid" it. Therefore, the correct answer is E: planned. Answer: E: planned<n><n><n>### Input : George made a bad decision.  What is not a decision George made? Choices: 1: was late 2: made a gift 3: was quiet 4: made an apology 5: was absent<n>Rationales:<n>1. George did not make the decision to be late, but was late instead.<n>2. George made the decision to give a gift to George's friend.<n><n>George made the decision to be quiet.<n>George did not make the decision  to make an apology.<n>George was absent instead of being absent.

Choices:  A: wait for B: eat out C: entertain D: please parents E: paint<n><n>### Response:		<n>You are welcome, just let me know when it's Friday and I will call you.<n><n>### Rationale: <n>1. First of all, we can see that the subject has a deep love for all of her friends, which means she cares about them and wants to get together with them, hence what she does on Fridays is related to her friends.<n>2. Next, the sentence "she loved to host" suggests that she likes to be in control of the events or gatherings and enjoys doing so.<n>3. Additionally, the phrases "every Friday" and "an open invitation" provide additional contextual clues. They are both related to Fridays, implying that the subject's action occurs on Fridays, and that there is an emphasis on consistency, as "every Friday" is often used.<n>4. From all these factors, the logical conclusion would be that "She loved to host [parties or gatherings] every Friday."<n>Answer: F: entertain<n><n>### Input:"I need to think about this and what?"

Choices:  A: company B: telephone netwok C: airport D: wires E: freeway<n><n>### Response:		<n>This problem is quite clearly asking us if the subject is looking for a certain company. They are clearly not looking for an airport, wires, or freeway, but we don't know what it is.<n>If they are asking a store clerk or cashier, perhaps airport or wires would make sense, but it still seems way too general. The answer is definitely not A, B, or C. <n><n>The author then says, "If they were going to the electrical company, they would be traveling in the electrical company's airplane and might have asked for permission or directions to the nearest electrical company branch"...but why would you need to be traveling in the company's plane to know what that company is?<n><n>The author further assumes that they are talking to clerk, and goes on to say the following:<n><n>"If electrical equipment won’t power on, first, a connection should be checked and then if it doesn’t work, you can always call the electrical company. (Or, if you are looking for a store, you may ask information.)"<n><n>This seems to rule out C. But how does this disqualify D?<n><n>Finally the author states that what they are asking for is likely an electrical company, but goes on to discourage readers from asking store clerks as if store clerks were the only source of information on a subject. This statement feels very strange and is the only one that has been explicitly called out in the passage with question marks.<n><n>We can see this last argument in action, as the author gives the example of going back to a store where you were just shopping.<n><n>But if you wanted to go home, what would you do? You could ask for information.<n><n>This is incorrect because if I was at the airport with a dead android and was about to ask an agent for directions to an electrical store, I wouldn't ask "Excuse me lady, can you tell me where is the electrical company airport near?" That wouldn't work, because the author has specifically called out the fact that agents might not understand what an electrical company is.<n><n><n>The correct answer here could very well be E: the freeway, but no one knows, so this answer is clearly very wrong.<n><n>### Correct Answer<n>Correct answer: D: wires

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where is a road known as a motorway? Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: scotland<n><n>### Input:: What did the cactus say to the palm tree?choices: a; where b: I can't. c: I can. d: Where are ye? e: I am not. f: I am.<n><n>### Response::: A: Where am I?<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n>A: where do cacti live? Choices: a. in deserts b. in rain forests c. in temperate climates d. in the tropics e. at high altitudes<n><n>### Rationales<n>In the first part of the answer, we determine that the main theme is biomes.<n>Since palm trees are native to tropical climates, this means that cacti (the answer) is native to climates that are more temperate. The best choice for this would be option D.<n>The word "palm" refers to the genus of trees that have "spiral" leaves. The cactus is asking the question in a very non-literal way, which means it is trying to make the most logical connection between a palm tree and the word "palm."<n>Another clue is the phrase "I can't," which means the "I," meaning the "I," is unable to understand what the "palm" is trying to tell or say. This points us in the direction of an answer beginning with "can't."<n>The rest of the wording is also somewhat difficult to understand, which suggests that the two plants are having a conversation in some foreign language (in this case, probably either English or a dialect of English with "palm" used in place of actual "language"). This suggests that one plant would know the "language" of the other, and the only plausible choice would be the species from which "palm" derives, Cactus. Since "where a" is "with" (or "near"), this is the same answer as choice (D)

C: Weird<n>4. D: Kind<n>5. E: Stupid<n>\end{code}<n><n>Comment: A, B, C (because I was not convinced about it) but after reviewing the questions, it is A, B, C. There is another part to the question that states "the pros and cons of the _extra_ responsibilities and benefits..." I am thinking there is a typo in the problem. A, B, C should have been 1,1,1 respectively.<n><n>Comment: I am not sure. B,D and E can also be accepted on the basis of the context. If it is a sentence level question. B,D and C can be accepted.  A: disingenious sounds like an oxymoron, and does not really fit the context; also in my example, option(1) is the most relevant. B: Human is a correct answer, but it falls well within the word limit. C: Weird seems to be the correct answer though, since it falls outside of the word limit, you can consider it wrong, you will not lose marks for a wrong answer. And D: Kind can also fall within the scope of the question, but in a different context.<n><n>Comment: As said in my above response, B: Human is a very good answer, if the context is a sentence based question. The word limitation also does not apply here because we get all the answers in a single sentence.

Choices:  A: make friends B: mingle C: meet people D: small talk E: meet new people<n><n>### Response:		<n>B.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The phrase "socialize by having" makes sense only if it is referring to a group of people - if you are having one trivial conversation with a person you are not socializing, you are just talking with that person. Hence, you are making new acquaintances or acquaintances with people you have already known and are socializing.<n>2. The question itself suggests a definition of what making new acquaintances are: trivial or small conversations.<n>3. Trivial conversations are also called small talk, hence, the correct answer is 2. B.<n><n>### Input<n>Answer the following sentence with the correct preposition:<n>The manager asked himself a question __________ to figure out what he would say at her interview.<n><n>A. about<n>B. about<n>C. from<n>D. for<n>E. for<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. Choices C and D are removed because they have more logical or grammatical errors.<n>2. Based on that information, there are two possible choices: "for" and "from."<n>3. "for" makes the sentence more grammatically incorrect.<n>4. Option "from" is the most logical because the phrase "asked himself" contains the verb "ask" meaning - "request", "query".<n><n>### Input <n>What was the biggest mistake the CEO made when she took over the company from her predecessor?<n><n>### Ration:<n><n>1.

Choices:  B: rulers and cubes C: feet D: cups E: pounds<n><n>Answer: A <n><n>### Response<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The question asks us to indicate which of three categories of things “we call” the things that measure length, volume, and weight. The sentence does not suggest anything about the actual word we would use to call them, only that which category we use to refer to them.<n>Let’s start with the category that we would not refer to as “things”. It is clear that the items described in the question are no longer “things” by the time we are calculating their “quantity” (i.e. length, volume, weight). In other words, they’re already been objectively measured, so referring to them in the first person seems to make no sense.<n>2. This excludes A: Thing, which refers to a particular object, like cup, pen, or ruler.<n>3. This seems to rule out C: Thing, when in use. In other words, we wouldn’t call a cup a thing when we are using it, only when it is not in use. This excludes D: Measurement device, which would suggest we refer to the actual physical object like cups, rulers, and cubes.<n>4. This rules out C: Thing. We would not speak in the first person about something that we own and are using, only when they are not in use.<n>5. Finally, this excludes B: Ruler alone, as rulers are used for measuring volume and weight<n>

Given this, the sentence must describe something they would simply like to be, and not some scenario where they are required to or expected to fulfil this role. Therefore, the answer is e: An inventor.<n><n>### Input : What does the doctor have the patient do after her procedure is done? Choices:  She needs to make a follow-up appointment. She should take the prescribed medications. She needs to watch for any side effects.<n><n>### Answer : She needs to monitor her blood pressure. She should not feel better. She needs to stay home for the remainder of the day.<n><n>### Explanation : The question indicates the doctor has had someone undergo "a procedure" but does not clearly indicate what kind. Taking this into account and adding to the context provided, the doctor must have had the patient undergo a blood pressure test, because only this can be described by "She needs to monitor her blood..." in line 2. Line 4 then provides an indication that the patient will now feel better, but it is not necessary to complete that action since they have not undergone any other procedure. Finally, the sentence ends by having the patient do nothing else ("she needs to do nothing else," line 5). The answer is B: She needs to monitor her Blood Pressure.<n><n>###  Instruction:What did the students know about the new teacher?

Choices: A: Problem. B: Breakdown. C: Broken. D: Trouble. All of this<n>### Demontration:<n>Answer:<n>Trouble<n>### Explanation:<n>The question asks the reader to match up two different things to the sentences that use them. The first phrase is the noun ‘smell,’ and we know from our study that a noun is more or less the ‘thing’ that is referred to in a sentence or phrase. In this sentence, it becomes obvious that the second phrase refers to problems because the person is stranded and it is a problem for them while smell could be a good or a bad thing.<n>### Test:<n>**The car broke down** because the engine was malfunctioning and sputtering. <n><n>**He has trouble** in his exams. <n><n>The car had trouble because it had problems.  <n><n>I had trouble with the dog because it didn’t want to run.  <n><n>### Answer:<n>The correct answer is F: Problem is the most specific or suitable answer here. ‘Trouble’ is more general a response. There are many ways to describe a problem. Problems can be small or large. The question specifically refers to a car “sputtering,” which can only mean it is malfunctioning or broken down. ‘Trouble’ can mean many things, but it does not fit the definition of the sentence. ‘Trouble’ could describe anything from not being able to move the car to being too far away from home.<n>###<n><n>### Inputs: What type of water transportation _would_ be human powered?

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n><n>### Response:		A: airplane<n><n>### Rationale: Taking into account that the person is talking about options to send small cargo, the only realistic answer is either airplane or truck. The remaining options are either too large, or do not deal primarily with cargo: train is for passengers, boat is slow, as well as ship's hold. Further, although airplane is expensive relatively to the remaining options, it is still cheaper than going through a boat or truck, so it is the perfect way to carry cargo. Hence, the proper answer is A: airplane.<n>

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What eastern state is home to a mountain? Choices:  A: switzerland B: pennsylvania C: picture D: asia E: austria<n><n>### Response:		<n>It can be a very difficult task to determine what the author is referring to here, because he has not provided a full name. I cannot determine how to proceed, but I know this because of the use of the colon and a question mark. Because of this, I will eliminate two of the answers immediately- a swiss mountain and a mountain in Asia. A Pennsylvania mountain makes the most sense to me, though I cannot say why. However, the answer is B: pennsylvania<n>

This indicates an immediate need. If we were looking for something we'd found later, we would "hope to" or "want" deodorant. Since it's being kept as if the person expects to find it, we can eliminate C: armpits<n><n>Given that it is being stored, what storage location must we be assuming? Our final answer is E: grocery store since they're saying "but some."<n>

Choices:  A: restorand B: wedding party C: church basement D: corridor E: restaurant<n><n>### Response:		<n>Damian sat at the center table at the reception.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>1. In this situation, the term "the center table at a reception" refers to an area or a table that is situated in the middle of a room, typically occupied by the bride and groom and other VIPs during an event like a wedding.<n>2. The sentence "Who sits at the centre table at a reception" can also be interpreted as asking who is present at the table, i.e. who attends the reception itself, rather than the table itself.<n>    - From this, we can deduce that Damien is sitting at the table, so we mark choice D as incorrect.<n>    - In addition, we can eliminate choices E because it refers to a restaurant, not a reception, meaning there can't be a receiving table present in such an establishment.<n>3. Finally, given what we have deduced, the correct answer is C: wedding party.

Choices:  A: pleasure B: delight C: bankruptcy D: agony E: owning<n><n>### Response:		The phrase "testicular products" as stated seems ironic and funny. It may provide information on John's relationship to these products. If we consider the phrases "swollen testicles" and "pleasure", we may have a hint regarding the cause of his troubles. We also know from the context that something must have influenced his purchase, and that whatever it was caused him to feel like he was experiencing "a feeling that he desired" and subsequently made him suffer because of his financial losses. It is reasonable to assume that John was experiencing "pleasure" at the time he felt entitled to experience pleasure.<n><n>### After identifying that John's pleasure was connected to how he felt in reference to his swollen testicular growth, we may deduce that the answer must lie among the following.<n><n>Answer: A: pleasure<n><n>### Instructions:The instructor gave the quiz yesterday asking:  In which theatres in Shakespeare’s plays are the lovers in love?

The sentence is in the imperative mood, and we know this because of the grammatical form of the verb "fill". If we look at the second half of the sentence, we see that there is no pronoun, which indicates we are giving the order to someone. In this case, "the lifeguard" is the logical candidate, as someone who is responsible and qualified to fulfill the order.<n><n>### Answers: The sentence "The lifeguard is a good swimmer" is equivalent to "The lifeguard fills the swimming pool". We can infer that "fill" here means "swim". The main clause of the sentence is simply a subject complement to the first clause.<n><n>### This is a question because "if?" indicates there's a condition.<n><n>### He is

Choices:  A: edge B: desire to win C: friendship D: rivalry E: skill<n><n>### Response:		The clues provided in the problem state that the subject of the question is looking for something to use to "compete against someone," implying that they are looking for some form of advantage in a competition, such as a new car, boredom, impatiently, or whatever is given above.<n>### Rationales: 1) The question tells us that people are looking for something to "compete" with when they are facing a competitor. This suggests that whatever it is, they are not necessarily looking it for someone they know. 2)<n>3) Taking into account the clues provided and the sentence structure of the problem, the most likely answer is "edge," as it suggests that an advantage of any kind would be used in a competition, whether it is a competitive edge, or a skill that a person has and intends to use to their advantage against competition. <n>### Answer:  A: edge<n>### Solution:  The most possible answer is "A: edge."<n><n>### Input:"We" were planning on visiting the library so she could study after school.

I can’t find out for sure whether we and she represent the same subject or two different subjects, however, the meaning of the sentence is that it is either "we" or "she" because of the "planning on" construction.<n>

Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n><n>### Response:		<n>You can buy treats for kiddos over a counter at a candy store. The phrase "over a counter" indicates cash sales. Auto repair shops are not generally set up for cash exchanges. The "post office" is clearly a place for kiddos to come in and buy treats.<n>The butcher shop doesn't serve kiddos, and neither does the kitchen.<n><n>Answer: A: candy store<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following short-answer question.<n><n>## Demonstration:The subject’s son is always taking his shoes off when he comes back home.

Choices:  A: friend's house B: curtains C: space shuttle D: front door E: classroom<n><n>### Response:		He never meant to damage what he felt guilty about. He never meant to break the window of (name)'s house.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>John's guilt is related to the broken window across the street. In the context of these given pieces of information, it is unlikely for him to feel guilty regarding other possible causes for which he could have broken a window. Therefore, B, the choice that names the classroom, is out of place. The phrase "of (name)'s" specifies that the house belonged to someone or is some place, and the window was the part of this house he felt guilty about.<n><n>Choices B and C ("friend's house" and "curtains") are incorrect for similar reasons, with choice C specifically saying that he felt guilty about the curtains of the house.<n><n>Choices D and E are out of place, as John didn't mean to break what, but rather, feel guilty about what.<n><n>Thus, the correct answer would be: The window of my neighbor's house.<n>

This clue points to the police officer as the subject of the sentence, and suggests the "action," in the form of "action words," "waving" and "flares," which are performed by the police officer.

They have the power to determine the severity of sentences for various crimes, though they must also abide by statutes concerning them. Sometimes they hand down lighter or heavier sentences than the law allows (as is in case of the lenient sentences handed out to the perpetrators convicted in the Nifong case and the O.

Choices:  A: university B: concert C: home D: terminal E: airport<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: University<n>Universities have been traditionally criticized for their poor security. This has led to several changes in university protocols, such as the implementation of metal detectors, increased surveillance of buildings, and increased security around student dormitories. Additionally, universities have also introduced various measures to improve campus safety, such as awareness campaigns on safety issues and the use of technologies to secure student identities. However, despite these efforts, universities continue to be a target for security threats, such as assaults and armed intruders.<n><n>### Why Do the Responses Contain These Words?<n><n>We can see that the response contains the following words: "highly," "criticized," and "security." These words are chosen because they are relevant to the question and directly answer the question being asked. The words also provide additional information regarding each of the five choices.<n><n>For example, the word "highly" is used to indicate that the security of universities has been a topic of great concern and is an area of focus for improvements. This gives us insight into how universities are addressing concerns of security and the level of importance placed on it.<n><n>The word "criticized" is also used to demonstrate that universities have been a point of contention over their security. This shows that there is a great deal of debate over their security and highlights the need for improvement. It is important to note that universities have been criticized for a number of reasons, such as lack of security measures and inadequate response times to incidents.<n><n>The word “security” is used to emphasize that university security is an important issue and that it has drawn criticism from many. Security issues at universities can include theft, bullying, assault, vandalism and break-ins. Additionally, universities can be targets for terrorist attacks, which can cause fear and disruption in the community. This information can help us to identify which choice is most relevant to the problem.<n><n>Finally, the word “security” is also used to highlight the ongoing struggles being faced with regard to university security. While some universities may have good security measures in place, others may still be lacking in this area. This provides additional context for understanding why the question is being asked.<n><n>### How to Write a Better Response?<n><n>Writing a response is an important part

Choices:  A: feel pleasure B: look attractive C: compliments D: interesting experiences E: joy<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: B: look attractive<n><n>### Instructions: <n>### Rationales:<n>1. "makeup" refers to applying cosmetics to one's face, so we can rule out answers A or E. Makeup is often applied by women as a way to increase their attractiveness or appeal, so we can eliminate C too.  <n>The remaining answers are all related to the appearance or self-image.<n>2. The most plausible answer is "look attractive," as this is the most likely way a person would describe their motivation for wearing makeup.<n>  <n>Answer: Choice B.<n><n>### Input : A man is applying lipstick, what might he be hoping his lips look like? Choices:  C: Full A: Pouty B: Smacked D: Light E: Natural<n><n>### Response : <n>Answer: Choice A.<n><n>### Rational's: <n>1. The most likely explanation for a man wearing lipstick is for cosmetic reasons, since this is unlikely a societal norm. <n>2. The answer can be inferred from the rest of the sentence: " his lips look like" hints that he is hoping his lips look one particular way, and the only choice which uses the same wording as this phrasing to describe lips is A.<n><n>Answer: Choice (a) "Pouty."<n><n>### Instruct:<n>A young man has on a jacket designed to keep out the rain.

The question asks for a type of apparel, so the best answer would either be clothing that is generally not specified or raincoats.<n>2. The clothing itself could be either a jacket or coat, as both terms are often used interchangeably to describe outerwear that is designed to keep the wearer dry.

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where is a horse likely to live? Choices:  A: michigan B: stable C: race track D: farm yard E: arizona<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: C: race track<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. The question asks us to determine where a horse is "likely to live," which implies that it lives somewhere. This is an object-oriented question that we can solve by examining the subject of the question (in this case, "a horse"). In addition, horses are a type of animal; therefore, we can narrow down the location to one that suits their lifestyle.<n>2. The only answer choice that is related to horses is C: "race track," as they often live around or near horse racing facilities. This is supported by the choice of "Michigan," as Michigan is known for horse racing and the use of horses and donkeys for transportation. Hence, the correct choice would be C: race track.<n>Answer: C: "Race Track<n><n>### Input:- Do not park here unless you are authorized- Choose an alternate that can be done- What should you do? Choices: 1: park anyway 2: follow the signs 3: obey the signs 4: drive to your next destination 5: park elsewhere<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The problem tells us that we need to park, which rules out the choice of "park elsewhere," as this implies an action other than parking. "Park anyway" is a vague answer, and cannot be used to answer the problem. The choice to "follow the signs" is incorrect, as a sign would not prohibit one from parking there, but would instead require one to follow the specific way to park. Hence, the most logical course of action would be to obey what the sign says. As the statement instructs us to "park here unless you are authorised," the only correct answer would be to "follow the signs."<n>2. This option is incorrect, as to obey can often be taken to mean doing what the rules or authority suggests rather than an alternative. Following is another choice that would be acceptable, but not as direct and would allow for the use of other solutions. Hence, the most likely choice is one that can be inferred to be direct, and that would be "follow the signs."

James is referring to his place of work in this expression. <n>2.  The next expression asks where he could easily find it. We can determine that the clipboard refers to a desk because the subject (James) kept it on another, separate object that we can infer to be a desk. <n>3. The expression to keep something easily refers to a place where it is easy to find or access. It is unclear whether the clipboard is always at James' desk or, if he takes it with him, he keeps it at the desk he is working at.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is correct to be "desk."<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n><n>### Demostration: Input: She said that the next time he called her, __________.

The subject has already spoken earlier, and now her friend is speaking.  The fact that her friend is speaking and the fact that her friend uses an indefinite article with her husband’s name, indicates that she is speaking in the near future. The timeframe of her speech is more certain than in the first sentence.  Because of this, the indefinite article is no longer required, which would point to the option B, (his wife), as being the correct answer.<n><n><n><n>### Instruct: <n><n>### Input;<n>Which of the following questions would it be appropriate to ask her if the reader wanted to encourage her to save for the future?<n><n>Choices:  A: Do you think it's important to save for a rainy day?

Choices:  A: talk B: read book C: play piano D: study book E: study engineering<n><n>### Response:		A student that is sitting in front of a bunch of black and white keys is most likely reading their textbook or studying for an exam. If a student is sitting in front of keys then that means that they are currently practicing and working on a musical instrument - like a piano. Studying their book or for an exam is not necessarily playing music, so C and D can be deleted. In the context of the problem and in all of these answers the keys aren't mentioned in the beginning, so the answer isn't E. Reading a book is only slightly more reasonable than studying their book, so, out of the two, we chose to say that the student is studying a book. The answer, then, is B: read book.<n>Answer:B: read book<n><n>### InputWhat are a couple ways to get the attention of someone eating, a book you were just going to read and a book you had just finished reading?

Look away<n><n>### Response1.A: interrupt them- It sounds like the question is asking, "How can you get someone to pay attention to something?"<n><n>- A: "interrupt him/her" is not a logical answer, because it implies that there is a reason to interrupt him/her but we were specifically told to think of a logical way to get someone's attention.<n><n>2.B: get their attention- This does imply that there is a reason for the person you are trying to get to pay attention, instead of directly trying to, which is why "B" the answer to this problem.<n><n>3.C: continue reading- You cannot think that the answer is (C) because the question specifically said that you would have just finished reading the book.<n><n>4.D. Take a break- You may think that you can take a break but by taking a break, you are distracting yourself from reading the book, therefore you would not take a break.<n><n>5.E. Look away- This is actually what you should do, rather than getting someone's attention. "E" is the correct answer.<n>Answer:E: Look away

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where would you find isopropol alcohol and safety glasses? Choices:  A: pub B: restaurants C: in a park D: supermarket E: chemistry lab<n><n>### Response:		<n>A supermarket might carry isopropyl alcohol, which is commonly used as a disinfectant and household cleaning product, but safety glasses are usually retailed at a chemistry lab rather than in a supermarket or restaurant.<n>

Choices: 1. A: list of famous people 2. B: list of celebrity birthdates (and ages) C: list of famous people over 100 years old 3. D: list of celebrity death dates E: list of people who were born on April 1<n>Rationales: For this example, we will use the following values: 1991, male and female.<n><n>1. List of famous people over 60 years old:<n>    - Choice A is incorrect because it indicates that the program will generate a list of famous people "and" their birthdates. A famous person is only a part of a birthdate, which is incorrect.<n>    - Choice B is incorrect because celebrity birthdate and age are calculated and displayed together as a birth chart. Birth charts include the birth date and birth time with birthplace information, such as in an astrological or horoscope chart. It does not include a list of death dates which are not part of birth date and age as the chart will only show your personality at birth and not show death afterwards.<n>    - Choices C and D are incorrect as this is specifically related to people over 102 and 100 years respectively and does not include list of famous people as birthdate and age do not determine their fame or recognition but only a chart indicating their personality.<n>    - Choose the correct answer as choice E as this relates to list of famous people born in the same date. A famous person is either born on same day or year or died on same date or year. You get the date and you see if any famous person was born on the same day. Famous people are people born in the same month or year or died on the same month or year. They are either born or died in the same month or date or it says on the list.<n><n>### Revision:<n>What are the main advantages of the newest smartphones?<n><n>### Questions and answers<n><n>### Inputs  <n><n>What is your greatest achievement as a young kid in elementary school?

This is an area where you would usually find pandas. The phrase "where you'd usually find pandas" suggests that a koala display would have a stuffed koala, typically. Hence, the correct response is A: jungle.<n><n>### Input:(A) In an interview with ABC, the mayor claimed the fire was caused by an explosion. (B) In the new documentary, the scientist claims that aliens caused the explosion. (C) In court, the defendant was accused of causing the explosion. (D) In the movie, the killer says aliens caused the explosions. (E) In the interview, the killer claims that he caused the explosions.<n><n>Answer: Choice D.<n><n>Explained: <n>In the interview with ABC, the fire was allegedly caused by an explosion, not by being lit. Thus, the cause of the fire cannot be an explosion. Hence, it must be one of choices (B), (C), or (E). In (E), the cause of the explosions is attributed to the alleged perpetrator; however, they deny having caused the explosions in court. Hence, it cannot be (D). It cannot be (C) because, it says in court that the explosion was allegedly caused, which means that the cause of the explosion was attributed to a third party. Choice (B) only mentions aliens; it does not claim that they were the cause of the explosive fires. Additionally, any interview claims that aliens caused an explosion. Hence the correct choice is (D). The answer to the question can be found at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5k_ZzPvvT4).

The report will not include the sale value of bicycle accessories. It will exclude the sale value of the bicycle. It should include the sale value of exercise equipment and tennis equipment.<n>Rationales:<n>1. The problem tells us that the weekly report will not include the the sale value of bikes which means that it should only include the sale. Therefore it should only contain the sale value of the sports equipment and not the bicycle accessory because the report only includes sports products not supplies.<n>2. However, the sale of the exercise equipment and tennis should be indicated because it forms part of the sales.<n>

What skills are required to be a scientist.<n>### Answer: <n>Scientists need to have a wide array of various skills. They can be separated into two general groups: skills that can be attained on the job and skills that must be learned and practiced.<n><n>On the job, scientists learn how to conduct experiments, how to collect, record, and interpret data, and they use computers and computer software to complete their day-to-day responsibilities.<n><n>In addition to the skills they learn on the job, scientists also need to be trained in areas like mathematics and physics. These skills are very important as scientists need to be able to interpret data and results with accuracy to draw conclusions. Since science is a field that is always changing, constantly updating its findings and understanding of the subject matter, scientists need to be open-minded and curious about new developments and ideas.<n><n>In the end it makes sense to include both a response that is simple and not very accurate as well as a more thorough response that uses facts and information from sources to back it up.<n><n>Explanation: These questions are fairly easy to answer. The first answer should be C (on the job) just because I think it's the one most people will choose (it is the one I chose.) The second part requires a much more thorough answer, but you can leave it more short for a simple answer and add more after you get the other one. Just my opinion. <n><n>### Instruction:Write a response  to the following questions  that complies with the request.

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: table B: restaurant C: cupboard D: kitchen E: sink<n><n>### Response:		<n>The dish drainer is the place where dishes are put to dry. This term is used in both British and American English. In general, putting silverware (which this question is more likely to refer to than dishes) in the silverware drawer is a standard practice in households and restaurants (A, B). However, placing silverware in the sink to dry would be inappropriate, as this would contaminate the water, and using the sink to dry dishes is not the intended meaning of the sentence (C).<n><n>### Input :What do you typically see at the end of the day and how do you want to do better the next time you see it in the morning. Choices:  a: the next day b: next week c: next month d: next year e: the past<n><n>### Demostration:<n>We can't determine how this phrase specifically applies to the context without more information. The "it" could refer to the following: a) whatever the subject sees at the end of a day, b) the behavior that the subject was trying to change and improve on the next morning, c) the next day of the week, e.g. tomorrow, or d) the subject's self.<n><n>1. To address a), the behavior in this phrase must involve a future change in the way that the subject acts as opposed to just the observation of events that have already taken place. Furthermore, if we are trying to improve the subject's actions on the next day, this would likely mean that their current behavior is not "typically" what they want. This indicates that the phrase "things you typically see" is meant to be the subject's current state.<n><n>2. For option b), since the subject is asking what typically they see at the end of a normal, typical day, this is likely to be a description of their behavior, not a date. This is also backed up by the "how can you improve" section.<n>3. The phrase "the next time you see it" implies that the subject is talking about seeing something in the future, not the previous day(s). This further narrows down the options to a), b), e).<n><n>4. To address option c), the phrase "the next day" is only used in the context of a list with multiple days (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, …). Thus,

Choices:  A: school children B: parents C: get money D: require to pay taxes E: take money<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to the question is: A: school children.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>It is given that the government helps with schools, a noun describing a thing or entity. The rest of the sentence does not provide any information as to who exactly gets this help.<n><n>The first choice provided by the question, A: "school children," is correct as it is the only noun that could be "helped" by the government, and it also seems like the most logical answer from context.<n><n>Some other less likely and incorrect options include:<n> - B: "parents," which would involve the help coming from the government to the parents, which is incorrect as it is not a noun that is helped.<n> - C: "get money," which is not exactly a noun but could refer to children getting money from the government, or parents getting money from the government because of their children. However, this is ambiguous in the context of government help, and this choice of an answer is incorrect.<n> - D: "require to pay taxes," which could mean, in a sense, that the government is helping the children by requiring their parents (in the form of taxation on the parents) to contribute to their own education. However, this is also incorrect as it does not fit the definition of "help."<n> - E: "take money," while correcting in the context of the government, is incorrect as it is ungrammatical English and incorrect use of "take" in the sense of taking money from the parents' pockets.<n><n>Hence, the only correct answer to the question is A: help the school children.

We might get a better job to make more money, but we are not talking about more money, just different money. We can save money or win the lottery to make more money, and probably neither.<n>We could buy a house, but we don't know if anyone saves money to buy a house, and it is not a big enough change (increase) to answer the question.<n>So, we will try the third one and ask if he can "feel safe".<n>Not quite what the question asked, but we are being logical.<n>What is he afraid of?<n>Well, not having enough money, so now we are back at making more money. We could spend more money, spend more money, spend money again, and not gain money.<n>Now we start to see the problem. Money is not what the question asks for.<n>The only way that I can see to "make more money" that is not spending the money we have is to get a new job. That does solve the problem.<n>Now we have a person that wants to make more money, doesn't realize that more money isn't going to solve the problem (or even make things worse) but we have put them as "wanting to make more money that he can't".<n>We can now do a comparison with a "person who wants to make more money", compare the two and realize there are no differences.<n>The answer is B, "a person who wants to make money gets a better job, this is a person who is already making money and wants more money, and now gets a better job to make that money.<n><n>### Input"What does the subject fantasize about while driving to work and explain its pros and cons?"

We are being prompt with "West," but "the beach" and "in the basement" are both obviously nonsense options that don't make sense.

Choices:  A: pine tree B: open country C: in washington D: wildlife refuge E: sky<n><n>### Response:		A bald eagle is only safe in a pine tree. Other possibilities would be that it was in washington (Washington County). Also, if you have ever seen an eagle, it is obvious that it is rarely in the air.  It is usually high enough that you cannot make out a white head, but it stays low enough so that it seems to be standing still.

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n><n>### Response:		<n>> Answer: C: feel bumby<n>><n>><n>> Explanation:<n>><n>> 1. The question asks for the physical response of getting your skin squeezed between two things. <n>>2. The word choice makes it pretty clear that what is being squeezed between the two things is the human body since "skin" means "flesh".<n>>3. Now let's look into each possible response choice and see if any of them make sense in context.<n>><n>> - Choice B feels cold: If the choice was "cold," it would make sense to say that your skin would be cold. The problem with this choice is that, since cold is a relative term, without a specified temperature, it can get very confusing. I can take a cold shower, but you might find my showering environment to contain too much pressure (or none at all). We want to eliminate ambiguous interpretations from this question.<n>> - Choice D itches: If your skin was being squeezed in, you'd probably find it itchy without having any physical contact with anything.<n><n>### Question: Answer the following choice question. Choices:  A. There's no difference in your personality B. You learn to avoid it C. You grow more optimistic D. You're more determined E. You become more independent<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>1. Answer: B: You learn to avoid it<n>2. Explain: Question gives background info of having the task of moving to be done in a month and a half's time. Then asks what will be happen after 2 months. This suggests that there is something in a new environment that might not be as good as originally thought in this original move.<n>3. We then consider answer choice A: "There's no difference in personality". It implies that someone's personality will not be different after experiencing certain events or change. This is obviously wrong since there is always a possibility of change in a person's character or way of thinking or way one looks after experiencing any change of setting.<n>4. The remaining three choices are a better answer. But the more appropriate choice is to choose "C: you learn to avoid it". We have been given info that we originally have thought of a very good idea and even looked forward to this experience with positivity. A

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: burlap sack B: hot country C: purse D: pet shops E: deep grass<n><n>### Response:		hot country (incorrect response) Snake<n><n>### rationale:<n>1. Context - The first sentence contains the statement "He had heard of a store that would sell a what... He decided to go", indicating that the what was a store. The second sentence contains the statement "The storefront didn't contain what he remembered, even thought the sign said that...", implying that there was a discrepancy, and in the third sentence the speaker remarks "There weren't...", implying that the what in the storefront was missing.<n>2. Clues provided in problem - Contextual clues in the problem include that the what "was a store" and it was not something you find in a burlap sack or in pet shops. Clues about the nature of what was missing include that it is "hot", as the word is frequently used to describe temperature, but also "deep", which implies that it was something that was missing in the storefront. Finally, in addition to the clues provided by the problem, the problem also states that the "sign said that...", which is an indication that the what did have signage that said it was a store.<n>3. Logical guess - "hot" is one of the answers, but it is used to describe the snake. The most likely candidate left out of the storefront was instead the hot country it came from, as "hot" might be an indication that it came from a hot country (which the sign would have indicated). The final clue indicates that the snake is the candidate left out of the what.<n>4. Correct answer - The correct answer is E: deep grass.<n><n>### Input (1): <n>"The cat stared in silence at a small white kitten that jumped on its back.

Choices:  A: illiterate B: knowledgable C: own house D: have enough food E: meet expectations<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer: A: [person who is well educated]<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>1. [well-educated person] is a context that is not present in the question. As the question does not explicitly state it, any answer provided should be a logical extrapolation of the premise. Therefore, the only options we have are [person who is well-educated], [person who is literate] or [person who knows a lot].

[person who is literay] is a logical incorrect answer, as it does not match the context given in the question.<n>3.

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Letters are sometimes delivered by hand through one of these. Choices:  A: mail box B: suitcase C: front door D: bowl E: post office<n><n>### Response:		<n>* You should not choose answers based on guesswork. For example, you could not assume that a suitcase would be the one to hold letters, even though in real life suits contain letters. There is no explanation that the answer is a suitcase.<n>* The first step is to identify the context of the question. In this case, is a letter being delivered? If yes, is the letter to one person or many people? What kind of mail box would that letter go to? The second hint given is a choice to use one type of mail box instead of another. Is this a choice provided by the sender or the recipient? Who delivers the letter, a postal worker or a family member? What is the delivery method: by hand or by mail?<n>* These kinds of questions are commonly referred to as rhetorical questions, questions asked for effect rather than an expectation of an answer. When there is a rhetorical question, it means that there is already context for the answer to the problem. Because each answer has multiple clues, and the context for the problem is already given, one can identify the problem easily.<n>* We know that the letter is being delivered to one person because 'letters' are being delivered. Therefore we know that it must be the mail box of one person.<n>* For the recipient, we know that letters to multiple people would go to the post office, so then the mail box can only be to one person, with the answer being 'C: front door.'<n>* For the deliverer, we know that the letter would not be to multiple people, as if that were the case we would have to go to the post office and not to a mail box. Furthermore, letters to multiple people are not delivered by a mail box due to the time taken to deliver to each one. Thus, the deliverer can be 'a family member' who is delivering by hand because a postman would not have access to a mail box.<n>### Output: The words the sentence ends with spell out this expression.

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

What to buy a house in USA? Choices: 0: car 1: house 2: bonds 3: businesses 4: bonds 5: car<n><n>##### Input<n><n>    You wrote that you need money to buy a house, but then you say you want to buy a car. We cannot understand what you think you want to accomplish if you want something and will buy something else. Are there any possible reasons you want to buy both? (e.g. you might need a car to get to work because you drive a long distance. You might also need additional money to buy a car when you move to United States for work.)<n> <n>You need a lot of money. There are a few ways to get more money:<n>    - Sell things you own. (Note: "thing" may sound better than "thing-s" in some languages.)<n>    - Find another job.<n>    - Get a raise at your current job.<n><n>The main difference between houses and cars is this: Houses are fixed (don't move) while cars are moveable (can easily move from place to place). That does not mean that you can't easily move from home to new home, but that moving houses is more expensive and more difficult than moving cars.<n><n>In certain cultures, it's normal to start living in a house and eventually buy a house for a person living with their parents. In others, it's more normal to buy a house after marriage where both people are more stable financially.<n><n>You bought a lot of things and you said it is too much, but you want to buy a new house, so this does not seem to make sense without deeper explanation.<n><n>##### Response<n><n>We can agree that you have a lot of things. You should find a better way to get a job and get enough money to buy your future home there. You didn't buy things before, so it seems that you don't need too many things now that you can spend your money to buy a new house.<n><n>##### Your thoughts: We don't find anything too hard or wrong in your answer. We encourage you to look for a job that would require you to work online so that you can stay home most

Choices:  A: dream B: fiddle C: watch film D: see new E: work<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer is:<n>`B: fiddle`. It is logical when I asked my boss if I am suffering from boredom, she may give me the advise of "doing something else" or "doing something other things". So "fiddle" is one of the word of the dictionary which shows the meaning of "To play about; indulge in frivolity or activity for amusement or entertainment" according to the Cambridge dictionary. So fiddle is the answer.

A line<n>> <n>> If it is a line, in what place?<n>> <n><n>From the last part, we can see that it is a line that could be drawn, and not other types of line. We would then need to look for objects that could use a line. As pointed in the previous step, "add a line" implies that "draw a line" would be an appropriate use of "add". From this perspective, an object that can use this type of addition is a line that's not existing. This means that what could be added is a line that doesn't have an edge yet, as if it wasn't drawn before the line would be added later on. Looking into a map of the streets, the only objects (from an outside perspective) that are unlined yet are the curbs along the road. Based on this and the clues in the sentence, the correct answer is E: play.<n><n>### Input :What would the person in the picture like the most?

Choices:  A: getting fat B: get fat C: typing words D: falling asleep E: wasted time<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales:<n>1. The word 'watching' refers the tv show you are seeing.<n>2. The word 'fall asleep' is a verb and the end of a paragraph which shows that you have not finished the question.<n>3. The word 'wasted' shows that you haven't used your time wisely, so you are accomplishing nothing.<n>4. The phrase "wasted time" is a hint about the context of the question, which is in a TV and the only hint is being in a TV, so the word 'fall asleep'doesn't make sense.<n>5. The phrase "not finishing" as a grammatical error of the question's sentence structure.

A or B would not be correct responses because you would not want to go to a wedding or a restaurant after you have been out all day shopping. You have had a long time together and now you want to talk to each other to get you minds off of the whole day. Going to someone else's house would be good for you and your friend as well. You are not bothered with other people so it's the perfect time for you to go.<n><n>#### Conclusion: <n><n>I am sure they decided on going to their friend's house rather than the internet cafe or restaurant or movie.

Where did he go to get more pencil?<n>Input:John ran out of what to make dinner? Choices:  a: onion b: mushrooms c: butter d: broccoli e: kale<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: John ran out of what to eat for dinner.  He decided that he would go to the place of his favorite food.  Where did he go?<n>Rationales 1. The phrase “what to make dinner” is a hint that this would require ingredients. We know this from common usage. We can infer that John is also out of what he uses to make dinner, in this case, ingredients.<n>2. The sentence “He decided that he would go” further points us towards the answer. Why would he decide to go to his favorite place again? This most logically means that John would go to get more food, which would presumably imply that he’s out of food because it is dinner time.<n>3. In summary, the rationales we’ve identified lead us to a correct answer of “kale”.<n><n>### Input<n><n>How many stars are in a perfect star?<n><n>Answer<n><n>The input we were given is "There are 12 stars in a perfect star."

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: training B: satisfaction C: injury D: beauty E: late<n><n>### Response:		A: training<n><n>### Explanation:The problem is structured like a "find the correct multiple choice answer" puzzle. We're given a choice of choices, each of which we have to analyse and select one which meets "if done correctly... doesn't cause this...", and "not cause this" can refer to one of four possibilities, which are "training", "satisfaction", "injury", and "beauty".<n>Those four possibilities are mutually exclusive, and thus one of them must be true.<n>### Demonstion:This demonstrates how to correctly answer a question asking for the correct multiple choice answer to a set of options. It answers the instruction, the question, and the prompt of the question. <n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: I wondered how many students this class really were? Choices: <n>1.  A: eight B: 17 C: 37 D: 27 E: eighty<n>2.  A: seventeen B: thirty-seven C: twenty-three D: twenty-seven E: 150<n>Rationales:<n>1.  There are two numbers in the class: eight or 8, or, using the rules of numbering, 8.<n><n>Rounding would be difficult to do as an elementary student, so if there are two numbers in the prompt, the highest number is correct answer is D, eighty, since, in this case, eight means 8, and 17 means seven, so, since this is a math class, eight is correct.<n>2. Using the same steps from the other question, one can reason that seventeen would be the correct answer, since eight means seven and again, this is a math class so eight is the correct answer.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: vomiting B: pleasure C: happiness D: contentment E: mess<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: D: contentment<n>Explanation:  In this example, the question uses the word "can" to indicate that the result is probabilistic, so there may be cases in which eating breakfast in bed does not make you feel content, but does not specifically address the possibility that you might feel ill after doing so, and therefore B is unlogical. Of the other choices, A, B, and C are all phrases used to describe emotions, so if it is the case that eating breakfast in bed can produce a negative emotion, then it can also produce the positive emotions listed as well, and the correct option is C: happiness. C is also eliminated due to it being an emotive choice that is not specific to the outcome of eating breakfast in bed. Further, D contains the word "mess," which is the answer to a separate multiple-choice question, whereas it should be possible to have breakfast in bed without making a mess, and E: mess is ruled out for the same reason. A: vomiting is also eliminated due a lack of evidence indicating that eating breakfast in the bed will make you feel ill afterward. The only remaining answer choice that makes logical sense is D: contentment.<n><n>### Input:"Getting to the finish line" would be in what context?

This is also why when you're wondering a question it doesn't make sense for your question to be a question that is not about something.<n><n>### Question: I'm wondering about this word...<n><n>### Answer: "Wondering" is a verb, and the word "this" refers to a noun, so it is best answered with A: what it means. The word "this" in the question points to the subject "wondering" meaning the subject of the sentence is the word "wondering" and it's being asked what it means.<n><n>### Response for "I wish I had this..."<n><n>"Wish" is commonly used to refer towards someone making a statement where "I wish" or "if I could" is describing what someone wants or something they are missing. This statement is used heavily in the United States to refer towards wanting something or desiring something.<n><n>This phrase "

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: exhilaration B: dismemberment C: spinal injuries D: getting wet E: splats<n><n>### Response:		(answer choice)<n>####Rationale:<n>This problem can be divided into two sections. In the first part, questions about diving and resulting outcomes are asked, and diving is referred to as jumping by the subject of the question.<n>Then a second set of questions appear, in which we are shown a cartoon. We can connect the answer to the second set with the preceding questions.<n><n>The second set of questions contains the following phrases:<n>1. "The cartoon character dives off a cliff into a deep body of water."<n>2. "His body is seen making an initial upward motion, following by a downward motion."<n>These two phrases provide the answer to the question regarding diving ending in comedic mishaps.<n><n>The answer is, of course, "splats."<n><n>### Input:"I don't know about you, but when it comes to what, I give them my all and keep on pressing." Choices:  A:"my time" B:"my life" C:"my passion" D:"my business" E:"my schedule"<n><n>### Response:"I don't Know about You, But When it Comes to my Life, I Give them My All and Keep on Pressing"<n>The writer starts the sentence with "You," and ends it with "but me." This tells us that the answer to the question, "What?" is about someone else.<n><n>"My business" seems to be the answer. The author doesn't make any comments about this, but in the rest of the sentence, they talk mostly about how important their own schedule is; therefore, "my business" is likely to be of equal importance as time.<n><n>### Input"If anyone knows what it is to be a superhero, it's him. He's the man, after all."<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The sentence is about a person named Jack. He is the hero of the story. The key idea is that in the story Jack is a hero. The subject or protagonist is a superhero.<n><n>You might think that superhero is a proper noun because it appears at the beginning of a sentence. But it does not refer to Jack directly, even though it's a name, but describes Jack.<n><n>The phrase in the story "He's the man,after all" tells us that Jack

The same logic applies for the fourth option (E), as there is no time of the day that high school class will be underwater.

The question asks us to "what people like." The question explicitly calls for something that people like.2. The choices are all activities people like.3. All the choices but "watch movies" are nouns in the sentence, which eliminates those choices4. Finally, we have to choose between A, B, C, or E. None of the choices mean dying. C is the most likely choice, since it can mean anything. But it doesn't make sense - if people like to stave in then they will like to stay in. But not people like to die. So the correct answer is D.<n>### Answer: D: The only correct answer is D.

The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Why would you not want to be working with wood? Choices:  A: blisters B: frustration C: being paid D: make money E: money<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question is not clear and I do not remember specifically what it said. However, I remember the following clues. <n>The word "would" was in the present tense, meaning the author was making a speculative hypothetical statement, suggesting that they felt working with wood would be an undesirable experience.<n>The phrase "being paid", which refers to a financial outcome of an action, is in the present tense. I would expect a "not want" statement to be in the past, or would expect the "want" statement to be in present tense, suggesting we are to assume that is desirable. <n><n>We can then consider the available choices and try to make a reasonable assumption as to what the question is.<n>The first word, "blister" is a very specific word related to minor skin irritations or wounds, and would seem to be an undesirable outcome of any activity.<n>The second word "frustration" is not a common or usual occurrence of working with wood to construct an intended object.<n>The third word "being" (money) is in the past tense, meaning we do not actually "make" money while working with wood, the implication being that working with wood would not pay well, or does not pay much.<n>The fourth choice "make money" appears to be written in the same tense as the word "being" in the previous choice. It should not be. If "make money" was an actual option, that would not make much sense.<n>The final choice, "money" is again written in the same tence as "being". Again, if the choice was "money" the question would make no sense.<n><n>I am confident the correct choice is D: Make money<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions:<n><n>### Input Q1 Why do you use your phone?

Choices:  A: in books B: radio station C: city D: tower E: medieval castle<n><n>### Response:		In books<n><n>### Rationale: <n>A:  There are only a few choices that makes sense, and this is the only one that would not include clouds. "In the city" would include clouds, "In a tower" implies living on top of the tower, and "in a medieval castle" could potentially include clouds from the windows.<n>B: The author would have mentioned it directly if that is what is meant.<n>C: The author would have explicitly stated that he could see clouds if the clouds were an inherent feature of his location that made sense in context.<n>D: Living in a city would not make sense as his location is described as "up on a tower".<n>E: He can see clouds from his window from both the medieval castle and the top of the tower. Therefore this answer is incorrect as the only choice here that does not include clouds in it's description is the option that the person is living in a book.<n><n>### Output: He was on the edge of his seat when he heard the news from the man.

Choices:<n>1: A: a song, about a song or a thought about that <n>2: B: a thought or a song about his thoughts<n><n><n>### Demo: <n>### Rational :<n>The sentence states "a song" was what he could have been hearing which means it is a correct answer <n>

Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n><n>### Response:		<n>- The clerk would put them in the pay envelope because this is where the paychecks are deposited and the pay envelopes are where the checks live.<n>- Option B is incorrect because the question states that the clerk gives them to a person (the clerk does not do this in this scenario), and the person is the one who keeps the envelope.  Option B, pay envelope, is the place of keepage in this case. Option C is incorrect as well because the envelope is where the check needs to be kept for a bank run or cash advance.  Thus, Option C, pay envelope, can not be an answer here, as an envelope has both a place of keepage and a place of disposal.<n>- Option D is incorrect because the clerk does not throw away the check (the question specifies that the clerk gives it to _a person_), nor can the clerk put the check in the trash since the trash is not a specific place where a check could end up, it is just a container.  Option E is incorrect because this would imply that the clerk, and not the person, is the one who puts the check in an envelope, when we already know that the payment belongs to the _person_.<n><n>The correct answer is therefore A, Cash Register<n><n>### Instructions<n><n><n>Which one of the following is not true about the word 'cause'?<n><n>A.

Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n><n>### Response:		<n>B: Playroom<n><n>### Rationales:In this question, the context tells us that there is an object, most likely a closed area, such as a closed room or an area of the house or yard of the given names. The phrase "to bounce against" is often used to describe a ball bouncing off of a certain object. That object is narrowed down to either "wall" or "playroom," as the phrase "a target on the wall" does not suggest another object, since "wall" is in the subject. Therefore, we can eliminate the choice "park." Similarly, "closet" is redundant. As the ball is bouncing against a wall, bouncing off the wall, and "the target" of the bounce is "toy box," we are most likely in the "playroom."<n>Answer: B: playroom

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:The delivery man was delivering a whole crate of shampoo, they went through a lot of it at the what? Choices:  A: supermarket B: motel C: at hotel D: shampoo bottle E: hair salon<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer, A, is a supermarket. The question tells us what the delivery man is delivering (a whole crate of shapoos), where it will be delivered (a motel), and what he did to get there (went through a lot of it). None of the other choices fit all three criteria.<n><n>### Input:"He aims to finish by the end of the month," said his boss, and the what? Choices D: boss A: client E: deadline  B: assistant C: task<n>Rationales: A. The question tells us two facts about the subject's boss:<n>1. The boss said something to the effect of "He aims to finish ______ by the end of the ________," where ______ is the month and _______ is any month.<n>2. The sentence's implication is that the boss is referring to a project that the employee will finish by the end of some month (presumably this month).<n>3. The question's statement of "and the" implies that there is something that will be affected ______ the deadline on the specific project the boss and employee are talking about.<n>4. Based on points 2 and 3, the likely project is business related, since both business and home life deadlines and projects are usually scheduled for the month (most projects cannot be completed by the end of a week or of a day). It's also likely because the term "goal" implies something that's measurable and that people can track; this is common in a business environment (the deadline).<n><n>### Input "I'm not ready to go there," said the doctor, and the what? <n>Answer: B: surgery<n><n>### Input :He is going to give a talk about how the what?

Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n><n>### Response:		<n>The "cat" is a metaphor the writer may have been using to represent something else, such as perhaps a cat's usual demeanor and speech. So the question is really asking about something the writer would expect a metaphorical cat to say. As the examples in the choices provided are not typical of cats, the answer would be a metaphorical "cat."<n><n>Answer: C: cat.<n><n>### Input; The person next to me looked quite upset? Choices: 	 A: what happened B: where from C: will happen D: nothing  E: how will<n><n>### Response;<n><n>### Rational:The sentence in the question is in a past active voice which is used to describe an event that happened. The second part of the question provides us with a hint "next to me looked quite upsets". This indicates that the person "next to me" is also in the past tense which makes this question "the person next to me(Past Tense) looked quite upset (past Tense) ". This provides a clue that the speaker is not the subject of the action and hence the person next to me is used in the sense of "the one who is next to me". We can rule out A,C and E choices as from the second part of question we can see that nothing happen in the past tense to "the person next to him". Hence the only correct choice is D: nothing happened.<n><n>Answer: D: Nothing happened.<n><n>### Question; I have not touched the book since Thursday. Choices:  A:- I have touch the book. B:- I have touched. C:- I touched <n><n>### Question<n>A: The sentence in question has two clauses in the sentence, the first clause is "I haven't touch the book since Thursdays and the second one is " the book". From the clue given " since Thursdays" we can see that the first clause is in present perfect tense and the second clause is in present tense, as both the clauses are different in tenses and hence can't both be correct. This tells us that "the book" in this example is the subject of the sentence. As the clauses are in parallel and are also correct, the correct choice would be B:- I have touched the book as the correct answer.<n><n>Answer: B:

Choices:  A: control people B: settle everything C: buy food D: increase power E: kill bill<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### Demonstration of Solution:<n>> It must be the first choice: control people.<n>><n>> The prompt asks which action Johnny might "choose," meaning there is some choice that he has, and that the options are controllable.  We have a better hint for choosing an answer in second and third hints of input. Let us focus on them.<n>><n>> "Johnny wanted it to be over" means he wants to settle what he is fighting. What he thinks is more important is not the money but control over himself, and the way he thinks the best way to regain such control is to'settle' the argument. This implies that he want to'settle' what he has with bill and keep what he is fighting over.<n>><n>> Let's ask how he might'settle' everything. He might give up the fight or reach an agreement with bill, and that is what he wants.  As such he wants to'settle everything' with bill.<n>><n>> What would the next possible choice that Johnny could make over money be then. That would be to buy food. <n>><n>> But that does not address the issue of control over himself, and it makes sense.  And the least likely is to raise his power or kill. Since these are uncontrollable actions, it is unlikely.<n>><n>> Therefore, the rational choice for Johnny is to'settle everything with bill' (control), and the choice is A: control the people.<n><n><n>### Input:(The man was a what and the woman was a what?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Why is this person not listening to music? Choices:  A: fall asleep B: relaxation C: deafness D: bored E: calm<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A simple way to see that choice C is incorrect is by looking at the first sentence and the second sentence. Since the answer of choice C can't be the answer of choice 'A' (fall asleep) and vice versa. Hence, we can rule out Answer Choice C(deafness).<n>For answer Choice D(bored) as the only verb appearing in the prompt being listen is the verb listen so we rule this out as well.<n>We can then use the same logic to rule out answers E(Calm) because the only verb appearing in choice C being listen means nothing about being calm from the listener.<n>Since there is only one sentence provided in the choices the choice can also not be answered with "the person does not seem interested in listen to music". So this leaves us with two options, answer Choice A(fall asleep) and answer Choice B(relaxation).<n>An easy way to see whether option A(falling asleep) fits in the prompt is the fact that the person is not listening to music. We can rule out the answer A(falling assleep) because the person is not listening.<n>And as we can see the answer option B fits in nicely within the prompt. Hence, our answer that best fits the prompt is answer choice B.<n>Answer: B.<n><n>### Input 2:<n><n>You are given the following information:<n><n>### Input<n><n>A friend of mine had one of his worst birthdays ever.<n><n>### Rationale<n>From the above input, we know that the birthday was bad because of his/her friends.

Furthermore, the sentence "we have already heard that the *monkey would likely be found* in the *great" outdoors* could either be a mistake on the test-maker's part or they could be deliberately attempting to confuse the student by adding a prepositional phrase to a question.<n>Either way, the sentence is superfluous and could be deleted without affecting the sentence.<n>Rewriting the sentence: Where is a monkeys likely to be found in _______ Choices: A: Great outdoors B: Rain forest C.

Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Answer: C: listen to each amphibian was the most important. Because the problem did not talk about what animals can do or not, so this answer is the most valuable and can solve this problem.<n><n>#### Rationale: The question focuses on animals' swimming capabilities. Since animals usually don't bathe, and listen to each other, both of these are unlikely to be the answer.

One of these would be that the kitten may not be familiar with what climb on in every room. This would be solved by making the bedroom door closed or locked. The easiest way to do this would be to closed the door, because this would prevent anyone from opening the bedroom door. This means that the easiest answer, and thus, the correct answer is A: closed.<n><n>### Input:"This was a terrible what?

It is not part of the question but, it can be used as a clue. This should help find the right answer. This is similar to the job because you do have a job. This is the best answer to look at. If you were to choose any of the clues that answer would not make sense. We can see that, "This was a terrible?" This answer is correct because it has something to do with the job.<n><n>### Note to the moderator:<n><n>This is an initial pass for this project.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Jan went to the auditorium and listened to the speech. Where might he be? Choices:  A: crowd B: high school C: city D: somewhere E: theater<n><n>### Response:		<n>The "auditorium" is the location of the location of the speech. "Listened to the speech" implies that this is where the speech is taking place; the speech is happening "in the auditorium." The "location of the location" in the context of this question is the location of the auditorium, which is the auditorium itself. Jan went to "the auditorium," implying an awareness of his surroundings and acknowledging that he is at the actual specific location of the speech, where the speech is occurring. "The speech" and "the auditorium" are both nouns, and "the auditorum" and "the speech" are noun phrases, so the location of the speech is "the auditorium." The speech is happening at "the auditorium " in the auditorium. By contrast, the speaker is present at "the auditorum." There is no speech, so you cannot describe the location as the speech location or the speech room because there is no speech currently taking place in the auditorium<n><n>Answer: C: in the auditorium

Choices: A: Foot loose B: sea sick C: fast D: Sailing E: Binding<n><n>###### Rationales:<n>1. The Words wheel loose: These words hinted that the subject (the wheel) has been loose before,  indicating that there's been a series of events happened. The "threaten to fall off" shows that there's a huge possibility that the wheel might fall off soon. 2. The words "are sailing " or "are sea sick": these words indicated that the subject "are sailing or sea sick"(is referring to their condition "Wheel is being loose") suggests that the subject "being lost in a long sail" is unavoidable. However, it is not "being tight", because "being tight" would be the opposite of being sea sick.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>### 3. Taking into viewpoint of the rationales, the most most appropriate choice for "being what" would be "footloose", that means the subject (the wheel's loose state) is a new state of affairs and is no longer stable, suggesting that there's a possibility for the subject of the sentence to fall off soon.<n><n>### 4. Thus, it can be said that "they are footloose" is the correct answer.<n><n>Answer:D: footloose<n><n>### Instrution Write a response that appropriatley completes the request. <n><n>### Demostrations: <n>Input: They had better what their intentions are before they try to explain them?

Choices:  A: fish market B: hawaiian waters C: gulf of mexico D: tropical sea E: south pacific ocean<n><n>### Response:		The first line of the question states that Johnny is looking for blowfish in place that are not near America. The second line of the question states where the blowfish may be found (that is in places that have fish markets, Hawaiian Waters, Gulf of Mexico, Tropical Sea, or South Pacific Ocean). So, there are two statements from which we can conclude that that blowfish can be found in Hawaiian waters, but not in fish markets near America. The blowfish is to be found near the places Johnny is not looking (that is, Johnny is not looking in the places that the blowfish really is). Therefore, the answer that is correct is B: Hawaiian waters.<n><n>Answer: B: Hawaiian waters<n><n>### Input/Output:An airplane flew across the water from the Bahamas.  Where could it have been going?

It did not move north or south from or to the Bahamas north jette.  It did not travel to the Bahamas islands.  We know this because the first sentence in each choice is BAH (airplane flew across the) and (airplane was flying from the)  which does not match the second sentence in each choice which is BNJ and BAR  which do not make sense.

The question also suggests that the answer will be Celsius, as that is what is being compared to when we are speaking of temperature. 3. The question states that this answer is above a certain point. In the Celsius scale, the only acceptable answers to this are degrees C, or higher, as the acceptable range is 0 to 100 Celsius. 4. To make the question even more difficult, the Celsius scale has a point labeled "37," which is the point when water freezes. 5.

Choices:  A: workplace B: bus station C: social atmosphere D: neighbor's house E: at school<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer A. _Workplace_ may also be a place to meet a friend who does not really live close to you, but it is more common to meet friends at places where they work or study. As for the rest of the options, I see less sense in them for this purpose. Neighbor's house is the only one where you can be sure the other person will be, but it has to be someone's house. Other locations are not controlled by any specific person. You may meet a friend in a bus station or on a train, but it is a temporary and unpredictable location, and you may end up talking on the street or in a cafe. Besides, if this is a friend, both of you are probably adults with jobs and a bus station is no place for them to be. (I suppose it is more likely to meet a friend who goes to a school than a person who just studies, but still). At school, when people are not studying, they are probably also not in a hurry to meet someone. So I think your friend is more likely to be at school, but I prefer to say at work because this person is certainly adult and definitely does not have a job at the school.<n><n>### Input Where do the police often meet? Choices: A: courtroom B: police station C: court D: supermarket<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answer E is correct. Usually, when you think of police, the place you want to think of is their station. There are many police stations in a city. They need to make a lot of arrests. A court is the place for a trial. You can also find courts at police stations. After making an arrest, a policeman may take a defendant to a court. He or she may also make it to the police station to be tried. A police station is also close to the neighborhood where it operates and where many of the people who are going to be arrested will live, work, and visit. If a criminal wants to escape the police, there are several places to hide: restaurants, parks, shopping centers. But if a policeman makes an arrest, he may go to the police station and tell them he caught the one he wanted. So a police station is the right place for a policeman to meet a criminal, and vice versa. A courtroom might be used for this, but I think a supermarket is something you will

The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits.

Choices:  A: sailing vessel B: paddleboat C: ship D: motorboat E: tugboat<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer to the problem is choice D, "a motorboat." The question clearly states that the helm is not something to be worn on your head or some other body part, but rather, it moves the mast(s) of a certain vessel. A motorboat is a type of boat that is usually driven by a motor and is propelled via propellers. Since it is a powered boat, it has a helm that moves the mast(of the motorboat). Thus, the motorboat is the correct answer to the problem.<n><n><n>### Input 2:<n>It's about a year too late to be worrying about Christmas shopping but I thought I'd just throw this out there in case you're thinking about it. <n><n>### Response 2:<n><n>I agree it is a little late to be worrying the Christmas shopping, however, I had not even thought about it until recently.

Choices:  A: amusement B: losing money C: charmed D: having fun E: win money<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Rationales:<n>1.	The sentence gives us no information about how the family is actually playing the cards, which strongly hints at it being a recreational, light-hearted way to spend their time. We can assume it is just the family having fun together, and that winning or losing money is not a motivational factor here.<n>2.	In the last part of the question, the phrase "win money" indicates that winning money would be a potential motivational factor to playing cards, so this cannot be the correct answer.<n>3.	The remaining answers can be quickly ruled out in the same reasoning. Choices A and C sound like a reasonable answer to the question, but B mentions the "potential for losing money," which indicates that losing money is also a possible motivational factor, so this is not the correct answer. D also says "lose money," which again hints to the possibility this can also be a possible motivating factor, making this the incorrect answer.<n>4.	The correct answer will be choice E: "win money." The question hints that the family is playing cards to win money, and no other answer makes sense.<n><n>Answer: E: win money<n>

Of those, Washington is a big city, Montana is a town, and the other states do not give us enough clues to determine where they might be.

I was asked to teach physics, which i had not learned in my own college days, and I was told that I would receive help in any way that I requested. I was given a large stack of research memos about the area of mathematics I was to teach, and the professors in that department told me I was free to make my own methods and rules. And I decided to teach the material in the way I found intuitively attractive. I was worried that I might not be doing the most effective approach to teaching physics or even to conveying the truth. But I found that my students loved the process I had set up as much as I loved writing the memos.<n>Now, we will take up the topics of science and politics. As you're aware, science includes the study of many natural phenomena. Among these is politics, which I'd like to start teaching here.

Choices:  A: direct traffic B: board vessels C: arm themselves D: help people E: find drugs<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n>The question asks what "some types of police" do; what type of police "only" do something suggests that that something is probably a small subset of duties for most police officers.<n><n>### Input-Analysis:<n><n>* The first part of the sentence that we see is "what do only some types of" which immediately suggests there more than 1 type of policing. We can see this even more clearly when we separate into two clauses.<n>* "only some" indicates that these police do this task only some of the time, but not all of it. This makes sense since "some" would be any type, and not just those that "only" do the mentioned task.<n>* The fact that the only question in this sentence deals with a plural subject is the only indicator we have for what the task is: police only do this one thing.<n>* So, we have the sentence as a whole: "What do only some types [of police] do?"<n><n>A few different phrasings might be "What type [of police] only do something?" or "What does [at least one type] of police only do?"<n><n>### Rationale Analysis:<n>The answer choices are:<n>* Direct traffic<n>* Board vessels<n>* Arm themselves<n>* Help people<n>* Find drugs<n><n>## Discussion-Based Question:<n><n>Discussion-Based Question 1: The above solution uses the process of elimination for each answer possibility.

This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: new hampshire B: dairy farm C: farm field D: texas E: county fair<n><n>### Response:		<n>The word "farm" indicates that the heifer should probably be with some of its friends to receive proper care and attention. We can eliminate choices B, D, and E, as these are not realistic farm locations. "Country" is the best definition of "farm," so the logical choice is A: new hampshie because it is a well-known, prominent farm country spot.<n>Answer: A: new hampsheire<n><n>### Input When a doctor says he would like to make you a liver transplant soon after Christmas, but he can't because he's on vacation, what should he do to get the job done even when he is gone? Choices: 1. B: schedule another date 2. C: transfer you to another hospital 3. D: make someone else a liver tranplant 4.E: have Christmas again<n><n>### Response :<n>Since a liver transplant involves a medical procedure, the logical step would be to transfer you to another hospital. The best option is a hospital that is in the area, such as a larger hospital in your city or a hospital in a nearby city. By being in the general area, there is no time wasted driving in order to reach the medical facility, and the patient's time is spent waiting while receiving care, not driving to and from an unfamiliar location. Also, being a well-known, quality hospital in the area, the patient's time with the medical staff and surgeon would be much longer in a hospital that is well-known and respected in the area, rather than traveling to a hospital that may be unfamiliar to the patient being transferred and may not have the same level of expertise. Because a liver transplant is a critical medical procedure, the best option is to transfer the patient to a nearby hospital.<n>Answer: D: make someone else's liver transplant<n><n>### Instructions:<n>1.

Choices:  A: rain forest B: tree tops C: toy store D: zoological gardens E: great outdoors<n><n>### Response:		<n>The subject would probably find a captive monkeys in a zoo (D) or circus (B). Although a captive monkey could be found in a tree (C), I doubt a monkey would be captive there. Moreover it could be found in a forest (A) but I really doubt a monkey wouldn't come out of the forest even it's not chained to a tree.<n><n>### Input : How many bangs would it take for the old oak tree to fall? Choices: 1. A: only about 120.2. B: only about 27.3. C: only about 3.4. D: it all depends on the type and size of the oakt.5. E: about 10.<n>Rationales: There are a couple of points that can be made.<n>If it took "only about 120 bangs" the tree would either have fallen after the first blow and we'd know by now or it would have toppled on impact which would be a problem since trees (assuming no wind) are very stony and fall down in a manner that could kill people. To fall on the ground a tree has to be already bent since it grows vertical.<n>If the tree is on the ground and "it all depends..." one only needs to bang it enough to be able to see the ground. In the other answers "it all depends" is mentioned too much to be credible and it is the same in most answers.<n><n>### Response : The correct answer is 3 with my reasoning being:<n><n>### Input   : Who wouldn't want their own set of sunglasses: black, sunglasses, reflect sunlight, and stylish?

Choices:  A: show B: theatre C: hockey game D: movies E: event<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is D. Movies are known for audience members being quiet, and it’s unlikely that a game of hockey would be a “fine and relaxing” activity for those who come to see it. Movies are also typically watched in groups, while hockey games are normally watched by an individual or small group of individuals. The word “entertainment” here implies a “public event or activity; the art of entertaining, such as acting, musicianship, or dancing,” which would most accurately describe a stage show or theatre performance where the audience is indeed the loudest.<n><n>### Input:(A) he is very (B) good at (C) golf (D) basketball (E) baseball<n>Rationales:<n>1. A. is very: the most common form of this sentence is "she is very _____." this implies that he should be good at golf.<n>2. B. He is good at: the phrase is "he is very good at golf," suggesting the answer should also be golf.<n>3.

Choices:  A: country B: trouble C: city D: sun E: control<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is definitely E. A democracy, as is a nation of many individual people, is essentially rule by "the people", thus B is incorrect. D is not the "rule" of a nation, as the correct answers are A, C, and E. If the question were not ambiguous, I would answer C, which is a city's governed area (if not, how would someone rule a city from over?) A government over a group of people is called "democracy", "control", or "power" over a city is called being the "mayor" or "governor", and to rule over or sun is clearly not related to any of our previous possibilities, so is also not the correct answer.<n>Answer: E: control<n><n>---<n>##### If you enjoyed this article, share it! <n>[![Share](https://dev.zulip.org/static/images/share-icon.png)](https://dev.zimride.com/sharing/article/share-post.html?pid=5f78ad12c46d1aaaf72574af)<n>

"workplace" makes sense because it can describe a school as well as a business, it is the most general answer.<n>2. Also, "his parents were always at his work when he came home from the workplace.." makes sense.<n>3. Another thing that gives away that it should be the workplace is - "workbench" and "workshop" are both workplaces.<n>4. "workout" is probably not the case since its more of an exercise and not about work or place.

We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where can you purchase food and eat it at tables? Choices:  A: house B: fast food restaurant C: library D: conference E: paper<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Demand the answer from the agent with /ans.<n><n>**Relevant UMLS 2009 CUIs**: food/84, food and drink - table setting /588565016<n><n>### Instructions<n>Write a response that takes into consideration the agent's response.<n><n>### Rationale<n>The agent responds to the question posed in the input as such:<n>Where can you purchase food, but not eat it at tables?<n><n>Consider the input carefully:<n>    - The question "Where can you purchase food…?" suggests a location that has food items. This is consistent with our earlier supposition that the question is asking for a place the speaker intends to buy food items.<n>    - The question does not directly imply that we must look for food items to eat out of the house, so it does not clearly rule out purchasing food items indoors or for an indoor setting. Thus, it does not rule out buying food that one would cook or eat at home.<n>    - The phrase "…but not eat it at tables…" then is a constraint on the place that the speaker is seeking, that is, for which the speaker would not be eating food at tables.<n>    - Again considering the context, the speaker is most likely not talking about buying food items that they will be eating out of the house: they will definitely be eating that food at a table.<n>    - Additionally, food prepared at home and eaten at a table is a normal occurrence, and is not an unusual occurrence. Since our goal is to search for the most normal, typical, frequent choice in this situation, the correct answer would be "home." So as not to be too redundant (see what we did there?), the answer will be C: home.<n><n>Answer: C: home<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. Since the question does not clearly answer the question, it could mean many things. We can eliminate some and narrow our options down.<n>2. This is a context clue; not only does our speaker not intend to eat the food at a table, they also want to eat it at home.<n><n>### Input<n>Eat or be eaten; and he replied "That's better than I think." Choices:  A. eat B. be eaten C. nothing D. you bet

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:James used the cannon to shoot at something while seeking lunch. It was overkill.  What did he shoot at? Choices:  A: body armor B: ungulate C: bomber D: kill people E: animal<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is "A:body armor."<n><n>### Rationale:<n>From the question of what James shot at, the answer can be inferred by referring to the word "it." It is not clear what exactly James shot at and what "it" stands for, but the question says he used a cannon, which is a big piece of weaponry, so the "it" probably stands for an area or place, like an office, a house, or a store.<n><n>Since he used the cannon, we can infer that he may be aiming to do an action that may hurt or damage someone there or damage something. This excludes choices "A: body armor" and "C: Animal." Body armor would not get damaged by the cannon, and since we are looking at damage and harm, it may be unlikely that an animal like a dog or a cat could be harmed by shooting a cannonball.<n><n>This leaves us with just "B:ungulate" and "D:kill people." "B" does not say exactly what was being shot at, so we can eliminate that choice. However, the word "kill" in "D" suggests that he's shooting at individuals, so it doesn't seem likely that he's shooting people. Also, he's not shooting at a large group of people, so he's likely only shooting at one person.<n><n>We can deduce that he's shooting or aiming to shoot someone with a cannon. We need to know exactly what he shot at, so we must refer to clue "James." The phrase "while seeking lunch" implies that we should infer what he is likely to be looking for. If he's aiming to harm or damage someone, it makes sense that he is looking for a target, and the most probable target that he is looking for is "something else" or what we call "lunch." Thus, the most likely choice would be "A" or "A:body armour."<n>

In either case, the subject is a metaphorical reference to something being better or more advantageous than the rest of the world, suggesting they were looking forward to something or expected something. Elvis Presley and Theodore Roosevel are both famous for being very well-versed in politics and in advocating for social progress, so it makes sense they would view the world through this light.

Both instructions, together, give me a complete understanding and can be seen as a single problem where the second instruction provides useful context for the first.<n><n>My analysis starts with the subject - "a person." This is a general, somewhat vague subject, and suggests that we are not dealing with a unique individual, but a group or type of people. This helps me understand that we are looking at a subject's common fantasies and their desire to fill those fantasies. I can also reasonably assume that the subject's desire to buy "a radio" is based on the first instruction and that it is likely for the subject to go to car and home, as the question asks.<n><n>There are several common radio-listening scenarios we could consider. Since this question is asking us to describe "a person" that wants to "have a radio" in their car and house, we could consider common situations where people listen to radio (car rides, commutes, the home). For the subject, that could be where they do their fantasizing and where they are most likely to "go," like to a store to buy a radio. This is also indicated by the answers in the space shuttle, where the subject is "away from home" and "away from work." It seems safe to assume that this is a common scenario, but we could also consider a more uncommon scenario.<n><n>### Answer:<n>**B**, shop. The subject wants a radio to listen to music, and that is best achieved by heading to a store, since there is little chance they would "

Choices:  A: get to know B: gain knowledge C: intelligence D: education E: gaining knowledge<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. We first analyze the context. The question implies that learning leads to "gaining knowledge," (knowledge is a noun, while more abstract, often unseen states like intelligence are verbs).<n>2. Moreover, the verb "usually" here is often used to introduce a generalization, suggesting that the subject will likely not have gained knowledge from any alternative activity.<n>3. From here, we further narrow in on a choice that is both a noun and verb: knowledge, or gaining knowledge.

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:How can a person end up stopping standing in  puddle? Choices:  A: move away from B: laying in C: sweating D: movement E: walking out of<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question gives us two choices:<n>1. A: lying in<n>2. B: moving away from<n><n>There can be no movement into a puddle, due to the question specifying that the answer is "ends up stopping." Lying in is not a valid answer, as standing is a state of being, and not lying in.<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>The first sentence of the question says that the subject is "standing... in a puddle", so it is clear that an option to "move into the puddle" is invalid.<n><n>### Reasoning<n>The question gives us an image of someone standing in a puddly or wet area, so there is a good chance that they are wet in some capacity. When people are wet and standing, they want to get out of the wetness, so if their answer is to "end up stopping," i.e. standing, they are clearly not leaving the wet environment that they are in. The only way to end up stopping in a wet environment would be if they lay down and stop moving in said environment. Hence the most logical option is clearly "B: moving away from," as the other options are clearly invalid.<n><n>## Rationale #2<n><n>### Demorstration:<n>Input from a friend: I do not understand how your answer was 5  and not 7: you are correct, but your reasoning is not rational based on the context.

Therefore, this rationale will explain the logic.<n><n>#### R1<n><n>Another rationale for the answer could be how people generally tend to get a little bit older every year by one year based on the birth date and age of the baby. Therefore, the year they are currently in will tend to be more than one but the previous year will be one. Therefore, the child is 5.<n><n>#### R2<n><n>This rationale is a logical reasoning for why the answer,

Choices:  A: very heavy B: video game C: news article D: card game E: lead pencil<n><n>### Response:		In a game of Pictionary, participants play by drawing a picture in an attempt to get teammates to guess what is being drawn. In many varieties of this game, teams are arranged so that each team member can be assigned a specific color pencil or marker which differentiates their drawing from that of other team members. The object of the game, therefore, is to have your team correctly deduce what is being represented, but not to get caught holding the marker (or other tool) of the opposing team. It can be said, then, that in Pictionary, people are playing with very small pieces of paper to take the lead against their opponents and avoid getting caught.

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n><n>### Response:		B: wilderness<n><n>### Explanation: <n>Looking at the "where does a marmoset" portion, we have to understand what a marmoset is. The answer is going to be somewhere the marmoset lives or is located, not where it was in the year 2000. You can infer it lives in forests and jungles, but the answer will be from a geographical location.<n><n>Based on the answer to the previous question, you know a promo will provide responsibilities, so, you know "wilderness" must be taken out of the possible choices. The answer is not "dictionary" because we know what a dictionary is and we have to use our knowledge to arrive at the next best answer. If the marmoset used a dictionary, the answer will be "underground" because most dictionaries are found underground.<n><n>"Fly" is not correct because you wouldn't expect a marmoset in the sky.

The input is split into smaller portions, or “chunks.” Each “chunk” is processed by different mappers.<n><n>Because the processing for each “chunk” is the same, we say the algorithm is data-parallel.<n><n>###ProcessB<n>1. The parallelization technique used in process B is "model parallelism and work-item parallelism." This implies splitting input data into different models, and the work item is the processing unit of each model. Instead of splitting the input data into chunks like in process A, the input is first split into batches of processing units and then each model is computed on its own batch using “model parallelism.” These batches are called “work-items” and this explains the term “work-item parallelism.”<n><n>2. It is a different approach than process A, as they both have parallelization and sequential computation.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:When going to sleep what noise does a human make? Choices:  A: loss of consciousness B: relaxation C: snoring D: dreaming E: talking<n><n>### Response:		When going to sleep, a human makes the noise of loss of consciousness, relaxation,<n>or snoring. When a human is going to sleep, loss of consciousness cannot occur. If a human is going to be relaxed, then the noise must be snoring.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>When a human is going to bed, he is either relaxing or going to sleep. If he is going to sleep, then the noise is loss of consciousness, which cannot occur. If a person is going to be relaxing, then the noise that is being made is snoring.<n><n>Answer: A: loss of consciousnes<n><n><n><n>### Input - This is not a multiple choice:<n>He was upset that his son was in trouble about what?

Choices:  A: rural area B: africa C: ohio D: big city E: tribe<n><n>### Response:		<n>If someone says "What is the opposite of village?" it will have to be a place that is smaller than village which means they are villages. This question must be city. Village is smaller than city. Hence, the answer is B: a village.<n><n>### Input The boss is not pleased, therefore he/she will be giving the worker what in return? Choices:  (A): a raise (B) a new title C) a new job D) a disciplinary letter E) a transfer<n><n>### Response<n>The boss not pleased to worker therefore means that there are many things he/she can do. But a disciplinary letter must be the first step or in another word disciplinary letter must be giving before an other things. And it does not mean that he/she will give the worker a disciplinary letter. It just means the boss must give the worker a disciplinar letter and then he/she go on stage 2 and 3. Hence, the correct one is A: a raise.<n><n><n>### Input : One must be very brave to fight a shark in the water.<n>Choices: A: A ship B: A lion C: A car D: A bear E: A whale<n><n>### Rationales<n>The sentence has a grammatical error: must must not fight. It must not fight if so, then they must be brave to make a brave decision to fight. Hence, the right answer is E: A whale.<n><n>### Answer: A whale.

However, the correct answer can be easily eliminated by using the clue at the end of the text.

Choices:  A: charming B: space shuttle C: house D: train station E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>The choice charming does not relate at all, as it implies a place, such as a room or building. The choice space shuttle may suggest a location where more intimate human contact is possible, but would not be the place where most people breathe. The choice house also does not indicate any relationship to more recent activity. The choice train station indicates public space which may be used by a great many people, and thus may be where one would find air that has recently been used or breathed by many people, but is not definitive because one would not necessarily need to breathe the air in order to touch it.<n><n>### Reasoning:<n>The choice surface of earth is the correct answer because air spreads widely over the entire surface of the earth, reaching from the deepest to the highest altitudes. Since air rises and flows back to lower parts of the atmosphere, when breathed by someone in one place, it may become breathed by people in another place, even when not in direct contact. Further, given that air is present at a high volume almost everywhere on the surface of the earth, it would be the most likely place to find air that has recently or presently been breathed by numerous people.<n><n>Answer: D: surface of earth<n>

Choices:  A: manipulate B: charming C: deceive D: exaggerate E: incompetent<n><n>### Response:		<n>When you meet someone, particularly a stranger, it is the norm in our culture to be polite and friendly. If the real estate agent is very polite, that in and of itself is not a trust building action. Being polite is about keeping the social status quo. It is a non-offensive and non-threatening approach that lets the other person know that you aren’t going to hurt or damage him or her in any way.<n><n>Ask yourself two questions.<n> - Does the real estate agent have knowledge and skills to do the job?<n> - Is the agent being truthful and honest?<n><n>When you ask yourself these questions you will know whether the real estate agent is competent. You will also have a more thorough idea of whether you can trust them. And if she is a knowledgeable, competent agent, the next question is why does she have to play a game of “to gain her trust” in order to sell real estate.<n><n>So by what are you, the reader, meant to gains trust that the real estate agent will do a good job? Why should the agent have to do something in order to have trust? If the client trusts and believes in the agent’s competence, the agent will be trusted whether or not she has to work hard to gain trust.<n><n>Real estate is a sales process, therefore, sales techniques and sales tactics are used. Salespeople have a set of techniques and tactics that they use to make sales. Real estate sales can sometimes be a manipulative, deceitful business. A competent real estate agent doesn’t have to use these techniques and tactics in order to make successful sales.<n><n>Gaining trust is an illusion - trust is not built in a day. Trust is built over time, by experience. When you’re trusted as an agent, your reputation should bring repeat clients. You don’t have to gain your clients’ trust; it is there once a client enters into an agreement and begins the process of selling their home or buying another.<n>Once you have established a client relationship, then you can begin to build trust so that when you share new ideas and information with your client, the client is willing to accept what you tell them.<n><n>If you are a real estate agent, the best way you can gain trust quickly is to share honest and truthful information and give realistic expectations about the market, and

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where can you buy a binder? Choices:  A: college dorm B: back pack C: class room D: backpack E: office supply store<n><n>### Response:		A: college dorm.  A binder is typically associated with college (it is commonly used in education to organize notebooks, assignments, and other materials). The other choices are not related to "buying a binder."<n><n>### Input:"Would you like to check your email? Choices:  Yes, I would like to check my email. No, I would not like to check my email."<n><n>### Response:"No, I would not like".  Although yes and no are both grammatically allowed options in this grammatically unstable question, the question suggests a choice which is logically invalid, as one cannot both "want to check email" and not "want to check their email."<n><n><n>### Instructions-Complete each of the following statements in the context of the given statements or situation.<n><n>**Please use commas between all items in a list.**<n><n>There used to be a time when a girl or a boy would say "yes" or ""<n><n>##  <n>A: when he was asked to take out the garbage.<n>##  <n><n>### Response 1.<n>While the text is somewhat unclear, there is an implied structure to this sentence which can be analyzed more easily.  A "girl or a boy" could be either a "girl" or a "boy," and the sentence is suggesting that in the past both "girls" and "boys" would say "yes" in response to a request to take out the garbage or clean the house, indicating chore-related or family-related responsibilities. The past tense of the sentence is suggesting an action that occurred earlier.<n><n>### Response to Response 1.<n>This one looks a little more like an actual statement to me.  There was a time, a long time ago, when a typical household would expect members to clean the house and take out the garbage (responsibility for the house).  In this situation, a female or male would have probably said "yes" in response, to the chore-related or household-related request.<n><n>##  <n>When I was 12 I remember watching a movie on <n><n>##  <n>## A. the night before my birthday party.

But I saw another table had a tip on it, and they were only getting water and bread and left it there.

He did want a tip, and leaving her tip made both of them happy.<n>

Choices:  A: demonstration B: conference C: building D: garage E: mouth<n><n>### Response:		In this problem, we can use the context of the problem combined with common knowledge to analyze the answer.<n><n>1. "my" is the most likely indicator that we are referring to this person's own property or dwelling, rather than a more general or unrelated entity.<n>2. Living is something one does in a building, such as a house or apartment. So the most logical choice is that the building is a house.<n>3. The word building has broad connotations that include both literal constructions like houses and more abstract ones like corporate headquarters. Therefore, we can cross this word of our list as not being too specific, and should instead look at words that tend to have more specific meanings: conference, garage, mouth, and some more unintuitive choices like demonstration. <n>4. "lived" is in the past tense ("lived in"/"lived at"), which is rarely used to describe a person's current or near-future location. For most people, this is a reference to something from the past, which points towards either a house or garage.<n>5. We can therefore cross off choices A and B, as well as C and D.<n>6. The word "mouth" is probably not referencing an actual mouth but instead has something to do with a home's primary entrance, which points us towards a house.<n>7. Finally, we can cross off choice E as being too far-fetched, and therefore the correct choice is B: house.<n><n>Answer: B: house<n><n>### Input:"We like living in such an attractive place." Choices: A: city B: neighborhood C: forest D: state E: suburb<n><n>### Response:"We" suggest that we are speaking about a place that is likely to be attractive to an individual or individuals. Because we are speaking of one place, the choice E: suburb, seems unlikely. We can therefore rule it out.<n><n>1. This leaves the choices of A, B, C, and D. We know that it is attractive to the individual or individuals, which means it cannot be city or state. This eliminates both A and D from consideration.<n>2. Suburb is a type of neighborhood, but neighborhoods in cities tend to be smaller than those in suburbs. Because of this, in most cases a suburb is smaller than a city. We can,

Choices:  a: The theater parking lot B: The parking lot at the Mall C: The theater lobby E: The theater itself D: None of the choices<n><n>### Instructions:Describe the work to be done <n>### Rationales:1. The first clue we have is that the subject is going to the movies. The sentence tells us that it is in the suburbs of the city, and we can assume this to mean a small town somewhere that is not close to a city center or downtown. If it was downtown they would have said the downtown area.2. The subject is looking to meet their friend before or after the movie.3. The subject says that the movie is at a theater in the suburbs (not downtown).4. "The theater parking lot" and "The theater lobby" are two choices of places to meet, though not very likely. This leaves three choices still possible: the theater itself, the mall, or the parking lot of the mall. However, the instructions have already eliminated the mall because they would have used "The parking lot at the mall" if this was intended.5. The instructions have also eliminated the theater itself because we know the movie is at a different theater in a different suburb. This then leaves us with two choices: the parking lot at the movie theatre or the parking lot at a mall.<n>6. We are looking for a place that is close enough to the city that the subject would not prefer to the mall

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:How do geese normally get from place to place? Choices:  A: carried by people B: guard house C: fly D: follow ultralight airplane E: group together<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>This question contains two elements to the prompt. First is the subject and then follows a sentence on where they go, giving me a hint on how they fly from place to place. Here we have two types of geese. These two clues give me a total two options. I can either say they travel by car or fly. The two options that I have are flying or travel by car. Since the context of this question tells me that I can eliminate travel by car since the first line of the problem stated they fly not travel by car. Since we know that they fly I need to understand how they fly? This is where they keyword fly comes into place as their primary method of travel. With the geese I am given an option on how they fly or guard house which are the options A,B,C,D, and E. So what I have learned so far tells me that we are dealing with four options. The next step is to eliminate the obvious answer. The obvious answer with this question is if you are familiar with geese you know that they don't travel with an ultralight airplanes. Next we have fly, which tells me that with this question I know that they don' t travel by car. And finally we have the last option which is the group together. This is where we see the final answer to this question. So we go down our process and look for the method of travel. And with our four options we learn that the two options that travel together are B and C. The keyword they travel together tells me they have some type of a method of traveling together, so the answer to this question is flying.<n><n>### Input How many options are we given for getting to work?

Choices:  A: pub B: plane C: beer D: store E: fraternity house<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are two separate questions here so the answer will be divided into two independent sections.<n><n>First Question: Where can I find alcohol and fried foos? Response:<n>In my experience, there is an abundant supply of both alcohol and fried chicken foods at the following restaurants:<n>+ Chick-fil-A<n>+ Applebee’s<n>+ Chili’s<n>+ P.F. Chang’s<n>The food of a restaurant does not generally correlate to whether or not it sells alcohol. The main restaurants to look for alcohol are bars and pubs, but the chicken restaurants may also sell it as well.<n><n>Second Question: Any suggestions to where I can find alcohol and fries the most? Response:<n>The type of food you eat can greatly determine how much calories, fat, saturated fats, cholesterol, sodium, and carbs you have in and day. For instance, an average serving of a classic pizza from ​[Sbarro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sbarro)​ at ​241 grams.  It has 40 grams of fat (114% of the RDA) and 1100 grams of calories and 40% of sodium. <n><n>## Requirements: What do you use to search the internet?<n><n>### Answer:<n>I primarily make use of a search engine to search through the internet, whether I use the search tool directly or one of the predefined keywords, such as the Google button within Chrome 1.5.<n><n>However, if I wanted to find something that is far more specific, I would type it directly into the address bar. For instance, if I was looking for the best pizza in a city nearby I would use the address bar to enter the address and search for pizza on the site. This would be much more advantageous than using an existing search or even my bookmarks, since it allows me to find information immediately rather than searching through predefined categories. <n><n>### Inputs: I'm looking for a good pizza in NYC. Choices<n>  A: Search (Google)<n>  B: Browse (Google)<n>  C: Address (Google)<n>  D: Bookmark (Google)<n>  E: Add Friend

Choices:  A: happy B: smile C: calm D: entertainment E: relaxation<n><n>### Response:		<n>Happiness is a subjective concept that can be difficult to quantify, as it depends on individuals' subjective experiences, so that an action or event may cause someone else to feel a certain way, whereas another person may feel completely differently about the same action or event. This is why the answers given to the questions "Was listening to music pleasurable?" and "Did you enjoy this?

Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		Choice D: homeless shelter.<n><n>### Rationales: Alcohol is often used as a coping mechanism for the stress of society, particularly its more impoverished inhabitants. It seems unlikely for a person who can afford shelter to be homeless, therefore it likely refers to an institution where homeless people often are. This would be somewhere else, namely the homeless shelter. Thus, the most appropriate answer is D: homeless shelter, with the other options (Bridge, Locked Up, Prison) being impracticable by this clue.<n>

Choices:  A: insect repellent B: heart attacks C: improved health D: shin splints E: being tired<n><n>### Response:		The answer is A.<n><n>### Input"I did not want to waste time on a small problem." Choices:  A. time was not that important to her B. she was too busy to spend time on the problem C. she was satisfied with how she handled the problem D. she chose to spend time on the more important problem E. she felt it wasn't necessary to solve the problem<n>### Rationales:The word "small" strongly implies that something is more complicated. If an individual thinks that a problem is small and then feels frustrated dealing with it she would likely move to a different task that does not cause the frustration or irritation.<n><n>### I will go to the supermarket to buy an umbrella and a pair of shoes.<n>### Rational:<n>The phrase "and a pair of shoes." gives the correct result of the question.<n><n>## Challenge:<n>What types of questions could you ask to test the learner?

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3.

Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The first part of the question specifies that the answer should be "not even noticeable", which means that the answer must be C.<n><n>### Reason : <n>The phrasing of the question indicates that a positive aspect of inflation is being discussed. The word "isn't even" suggests that whatever the person is noticing doesn't have much impact on their life.<n><n>### The second part of the question states that fighting inflation isn'<n><n>The word "isn' even indicates that, when fighting inflation, it is not even necessary to spend more money on things<n><n>### Choices A and B, are incorrect because they do not include the phrase "fighting inflation." Choice D is also incorrect because it does not include the phrase "is not even"<n><n>The last part of the question states, "not noticeable." <n><n>This phrase implies that only noticeable things are noticeable, so, if the answer is anything that is not noticeable, it must be choice C.<n><n>## Instruction: Write a brief summary of the main points of the speech, and give your personal opinion of it.<n><n>### Summary:<n>There are two main ideas in the speech.

To me, "robbery" usually means a burglary and not mugging.<n><n>The question asks the type of crime that the police accused the person of committing. This makes me think about common crimes that people usually get arrested for: murder, theft, rape, or assault.

Choices:  A: winners and losers B: perform better C: might win D: losses E: enemies<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The question says that John is competitive and I need to figure out how to divide people into more than two categories that he likes, so I can figure out the right answer.<n><n>During the first step, I'll notice the keyword "divide." The first clue I've found is that John likes to compete, not just to play one game but rather to "divide people." So, I know that John likes competing more than one category and my objective is to list them by giving more information in the question.<n><n>At this point, I'll move to the second step; during this step I will try to come up with all the information I can.<n><n>Firstly, I know that John needs two categories that he lik's and this helps me determine which two categories John actually likes the most. So I'll go into detail about how do I differentiate between the two categories.<n><n>I'm going to start by listing what kind of things/factors John would consider to make one thing a "winner" and another a "loser." First, John's preferences will come into play, so I can start by listing some preferences for "winners" and "losers."<n><n>Secondly, is that John doesn't care about who he plays with, he's "just" concerned about competing as long as he wins. So he's won't take anything related to that other player into consideration, so I can cross it out and put it aside.<n><n>After this, it will be easier for me to list factors that are related to a "loss". A key difference between a "winner" being in the first category and a "loser" is that when a player is a "loser," he loses. As a result, John will consider this as a "loss" and not a "win."<n><n>A "win" is not something that is in John's control, but if the opposing player is in the first category, the "win" is within his control; at least partially. I'll cross out the winning because I can no longer have both categories "winners" or "loser."<n><n>By the end of this step I'll have two categories: winning and losing.<n><n>Lastly, all the factors I'll put in one of the categories are those related to winning. John doesn

Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: E: exhiliraction<n><n>### Response rationale:<n>The clines that were not satisfied by the answer choices of the previous section indicate that the "chistmas" in the question is a mispelling and should be "Christmas," indicating a more specific time period.<n>The question states that a person is considering buying Christmas presents and that a "matter of principle/s" prevents them. "Matter of principle/s," by itself, suggests that the reason they want to buy Christmas presents but can't is a matter of principle or belief. This narrows our answer choices quite bit:<n>1. Happiness is a strong motivator and certainly would cause a person to buy presents, but it is not a "thing" one may find themselves lacking on a matter of principle.<n>2. Lack of money: it is possible to lack money and not buy presents. However, if someone wants to buy presents but something like lack of money prevents them, it is unlikely that the reason for their wish to buy presents is money.<n>3. Stress, impatience, or relief: these have to do with emotional states, which are more of a psychological rather than a motivational concept. In addition, again, the reason a person wants to buy presents but can't would have to be related to a matter of principle or to beliefs.<n>4. Exhilaration: this is a state of emotion or exhiliration, that is, feeling happy and excited. In the scenario of this question, the problem is not how one feels when looking at Christmas presents but that one cannot go purchase them, which suggests that the reason for that is a belief which says one cannot purchase Christmas presents.<n>5. This leaves exhiliration as the true answer for this question.<n><n>## Input:Why do you need a work contract?

Attend more classes 3. Sleep less Choices: 4. Ride a bike 5. Make a study group<n>Rationales: The prompt provides us some clues on what happened and what we learned from it. Based on the clues, we know the exam is probably an academic one. This is also a multiple choice question, so the subject would probably be taking an exam.<n>The question asks us to do something differently, not what to do, so the answer is not simply to study more or attend more classes. There should be an action verb, which can be either "really" or "again". However, "again" doesn't really make sense. For example, we wouldn't think of trying to sleep more - we know it isn't a sleeping test or something. Hence, the right answer choice would be the same as the action verb, which is 2.

Attend morer Classes<n><n>### Instruct:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Explanation:<n><n>Input: What do you prefer to do on weekends, spending time outdoors or staying at home?

We can assume that the subject likes to do more than one of the activities outlined, so none of the choices would be "one" and we should select multiple.<n>The other clues do not really provide good hints. There is no particular reason to expect it to take up more time or involve other friends, as the question doesn't really suggest that it's something one does often. I think, in this case, it would be just more logical to use the other choice to see which sounds more correct.<n>The only logical choice is then

Choices:  I: the weather II: the food III: the tour guide IV: the people V: the crowds Answer: B: the food<n><n>### Response<n>This question is based on the information given, rather than the wording of the question. The man did not like the food, implied by the fact that he "felt like he was eating the same thing everywhere he went." He did not like the people (not sure if that applies here), the crowd, or the tour guide; so "the food" is the correct answer.<n><n>### Response to the Response<n>This response is incorrect in that France is home to a variety of weather conditions. One might not necessarily like the weather, but it may be a good or bad experience for various reasons. In addition, the food in France changes dramatically from one area to another, as well as from one season to another; for example, food in the summer is very different from food in the winter. Furthermore, the food from one region may be different from the food in another region, for example in Paris and in rural areas. Moreover, it should be noted that the food industry in France is changing and adapting, making the food very international and diverse.<n><n>Answer: B: the food

This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

However, there is nothing else in the question that could be analyzed with the answer to this problem.<n>The second hint I was thinking is the phrase "first half to first 25 mins".

Since the context is vague and does not provide any other relevant information, we can assume that the city is recovering from some kind of devastating event.<n><n>When the question gives specific clues that point in one direction, it is important to carefully read the information provided. In this case, the mention of a "war" gives us a strong indication that the city is recoverinig from a war.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What would an adult man do to get ready for work? Choices:  A: dress herself B: shower C: dress himself D: drink beer E: drive train<n><n>### Response:		<n>Your response is in the format that I instructed below.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>You didn't write a complete response in your example, but with the help of [this article on the subject](https://www.toptal.com/hiring/how-to-ask-better-questions-to-hire-better-engineers) I learned how to ask questions and evaluate what someone wrote me. Your answer would be in the form of an email, so I have added the question mark you missed in my response.<n><n>1. The first sentence shows that you understand how to ask someone to provide specific information: you clearly understood that the question required you to make a prediction, not provide personal opinions on the question at hand. Great job!<n>2. The response would begin with a salutation, and it was appropriate to write this information in the first line of your email. Please make sure that you don't leave this information out.<n>3. The rest of your response did not mention the subject at all! When asked a question about the "Pros and Cons of a particular job skill/technology," it is important to identify the skill or technology in question. A possible answer might be something like: ["a few pros (or cons)"](/answers/19661), a possible [template](/answers/170355/answer/129). In this case, a good pro might be that the subject can build or break relationships and earn trust, and a con might be that it requires a lot of energy or it has too much power.<n><n>### Update:<n>The subject of this post has been [updated](/answers/158615/answer/162137) to fix what you pointed out here. Please accept my apologies for having missed this information! I'm sure that you would have made my original response a great one!<n><n>Thank you so much for your time and effort. I hope that you will be able to take advantage of some of the opportunities that we have to offer within our company. We do hire the right fit for the company after all. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<n><n>    // If the following line is not included, the email bounces back with an error.<n><n><[email protected]><n>

Where might Simon be taking the cow? Choices:  A: countryside B: city C: dairy farm D: butcher shop E: canada<n><n>### Response:		<n>In this case, I do not believe there is sufficient proof to exclude the answer choices 'countryside' and 'dairy farm'. They are both options that are plausible given what there is in the question.<n><n>Answer A: countrysiiide<n>Answer B: dairy farm<n><n>### Input : Simon bought a cow because he really want to put it to work what he didn't want any meats for it where might Simon be taking the co? Choices:  a: country side b: dairy farm c: butcher shop d: canada E : none of them<n><n>### Response :<n>In this, there are a lot of different answer choices which are all plausible and are all somewhat logical options, given what is stated in the question. It might be useful to see the question as two separate parts: the first part (where Simon bought a cow because...) is a very general sentence that offers contextual clues for the second part (but doesn't actually specify what the context is).<n><n>First, we have the question of what, exactly, the cow is being put to work with. It was bought to work, so it shouldn't just be grazing or being a pet or having its life as an end in itself. Rather, it is "put to work" for something.<n><n>In the second part of the question, we have the clue of Simon not wanting any meat from the cow, but there is no real information as to what this is in relation to. If the question had been phrased 'Simon bought a cow to put to work and didn't want it for meat. Where is Simon going to keep the cow?', we have clarification about what the meat might be going for (butcher shop) and we also have an added incentive and additional motivation for Simon to keep the cow in the dairy farm.<n><n>Finally, we could see this question as stating what Simon didn't want, but not what he did want. This would indicate that his motive for acquiring the cow may lie in some kind of non-meat use. However, this is assuming the question does not contain important information that we do not know is present in the question.

Choices:  A: art room B: police station C: classroom D: desk drawer E: school<n><n>### Response:		<n>As a student, I spend my days in a classroom, but it has never been covered or decorated with lots of glue bottles. Rather, it’s full of bubbling pondering, erasers and pencil shavings, homework problems for the teacher to correct, and occasional glue stains from art projects.<n><n>### Input<n>Having lots of glue bottle in a building means the building is art room<n><n>Rationales:<n><n>There are a few common ways that the term “bottles” might be used related to a building or property, and none of them apply here:<n><n>- When we say a person has a “bottle” of a certain substance, we’re referring to bottles of an alcoholic beverage, like whiskey. Unless this building contains a bar, this isn’t what is meant in the question.<n>- If we are referring to bottles of medication the first thing to note is that there is no medication involved in the example in the question and that the building’s contents would be incompatible with most medications; therefore, it makes no sense to refer to a building as a “bottle of medicine,” regardless of what kind.<n>- The phrase “bottles of water” is commonly used to describe the drink bottles a person is carrying. The building is neither a student taking water bottles to school nor a worker who brings bottles of water back from a job site. The context of the question clearly indicates that we are not dealing with bottles of water.<n>- Like “medicine bottles” and “bottles of drinks, “bottles of perfume” is also not relevant, as we are clearly not dealing with perfume, only glue bottles.<n>- Similarly, “bottles used to sell or store foods,” or “bottles used in cooking” are not at all related to the question. The concept of cooking can be narrowed down to “in a kitchen or kitchen area” and is irrelevant to the context of the question.<n>- Likewise, we could be talking about bottles for fire in a firehouse; however,the context suggests a school or college, and there is no indication here that the building is used for fire protection or as a residence.<n>- The phrase "a bottle of something" is

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  B: what is it A: what am I doing C: what I was doing E: going to do<n>---<n>```<n>The question could be something like :I didn't want to finish my homework and just did everything it REALLY what to do or I didn't want finish my homework today and just do everything what I REALLY what to? <n>```<n>1. The key to the answer is "did everything", so the action in this statement must have been one that could be done in every sense (without an option to "do", which limits the choice).<n>2. The context of the question then is that of studying and homework, so any action or statement in this regard would fit.<n>3. The second part of the question mentions that the speaker wanted to do something else, this suggests that whatever they did was not what they wished to do but what they ended up doing despite their intention to do something else instead.<n>4. We can therefore logically eliminate choices A and C as there are "I" and "wash" in these choices, which seem too specific for general use as opposed to what could be done in every case (without the "what"). <n>5. Choices B and E are also too specific in their phrasing; they can be considered as eliminations, although they may not fit in the context exactly they could also be potential choices.<n>6. The context also indicates that the act involved in the question is going to involve some type of work, so something that requires less effort is likely, and so choice D is eliminated.<n>7. Finally, based on our analysis, the most logical choice would be B: what am I doing, which fits the context and provides a grammatically correct option to fill the gap. <n>Answer: B: what am I doigng<n><n>### Input : The question to what you do that always makes you cry? Choices:  D: nothing in the world but what A: no but the fact that my parents don't understand what is happening to me. E: no except for what <n>---<n>```<n>What could you do that always makes cry or make me cry.  To do what and me<n>```<n>1. "what" seems like a bit odd
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What is a sign that you might not be living soon? Choices:  A: growing older B: reproducing C: shuddering D: perspiration E: palpitations<n><n>### Response:		<n>If someone asks you if you are living soon means that the person is interested in determining if the listener are a human.<n>Answer: A: growing older

Choices:  A: good health B: heart attacks C: relaxation D: rest E: fatigue<n><n>### Response:		C,relaxation<n>### Input:Why are they trying to reduce the stress associated with the new position? Choices: 1) The environment will be more supportive now 2) They will be better at managing their time 3) They will feel more comfortable with the change 4) It will be less demanding 5) They will be in control Question 2<n><n>### Rationales: 1) The first sentence gives us an idea of the type of change involved. A person is being "promoted" to a higher level, suggesting a "new" or "different" job.<n>2) "Stress management" is a phrase or keyword we often hear in job-related situations. This indicates that the subject is most likely to have experienced stress or uneasiness in their previous work position.<n>3) The sentence in which the job change is mentioned, "reducing stress associated with the new job" provides more clues about the context. These two sentences tell us that (a) the change was stressful enough for the subject to consider changing the job, (b) the subject experienced stress or uneasyness related to work.<n>4) In the given sentence, we can see that the main character is contemplating the pros and cons of a new job, thus we can assume that they have made it to the higher level, so stress management probably becomes important for them. Also, we see that they are looking for the "less demanding" part of the change, supporting the answer C, relaxation.<n><n><n>### Input:-Why is the subject looking for the less demanding part of the change to the new job?-Can you think of any reasons why stress management might be challenging?<n><n>### Rationale:  -In the sentence "The subject is looking for the less demand stress", we can easily see that it is the new change or position that becomes less demanding for the subject due to new experiences, skills and knowledge.<n>-It probably becomes hard to relax or manage the stress, as the person is overwhelmed by all the new and probably, unknown responsibilities and expectations that the change brings.<n>### Instructions:Choose the best answer to this question.<n><n>## Input:-Why is the situation less stressful for the new executive?<n><n>### Options:-They are doing much the same work in their new job.<n>### Options

Choices:  A: battle field B: museum C: weapon D: canon E: tornado<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: The question gives us no indication where the ball will be found, so its location will not provide any clue to the answer, nor will one of the options, which are all irrelevant.<n>The question also does not say whether the war is past or present. The past tense would not make much sense if the war is ongoing, so the "war" question refers to past, most likely as opposed to present.<n><n>The question refers to bullet projectiles, which is highly specific. Bullets are small and usually fired quickly in huge amounts. Also, most bullets are metal, indicating the object referred to in the question is metal.<n><n>The "bullet" referred to in the question could have been fired by:<n>    - A machine gun, which, as a weapon, is most likely to fire bullets.<n>    - A canon, which, to our knowledge, does not shoot bullets but is generally made of metal.<n><n>Taking into account the context, "bullets" in the question indicate projectiles.<n>Thus, taking into account the fact that most war cannons were made of metal but not all bullets were, the most logical answer is: C: weapon.<n><n>Answer: C: weapon<n><n>

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where would a Martian find the Indian Ocean? Choices:  A: asia B: southern hemisphere C: planet D: east E: earth<n><n>### Response:		<n>If the subject of the question were a Martian, they would not know anything about Earth. Given that they are driving, the question must be asking a question that a pilot would ask to figure out the meaning of a point on the map. The choice "Asia" is not a good answer because it does not look like a sea that was named after a location on the map in the original question. However, the other answers are all countries, which means that the planet of Earth or a group of people called the "Indians" might have found the Indian Ocean. The next best answer is then "Southern Hemisphere," because this is the only name of a planet that is not human in origin. The other answers make sense but are not answers to the question: "Where would a Martian need to go to find the Indian Ocean?". The correct answer to the question is then "Southen Hemisphere."<n><n>### Input : If the sun rose in the afternoon, how would this result in? Choices:  I: people driving to work and other activities would increase, as everyone would want to be up and active during the day. Choices:  J: more people would be traveling to work and other activities at night, as they would want to go out and explore after dusk. K: fewer people would be traveling during the day, as everyone would have to stay inside and staying inside during the day. H: everyone would be at work during the day and at the same office during the day, as the sun would be up anyway.<n><n>### Response :<n>During the time that there is a lot of light, people tend to be more awake. If the sun rises during the day, there would be a sunrise. If there was a sunrise, every one would be awake during the day. This is why K is a possible answer. However, the question does not ask what will happen when the sun rises during a day. It is asking about what will happen if there was a sunset during the day. There would be very little light in the evening because of the sunset. With a sunset so early, there would be no other sunrises during the day.<n><n>\section{Output :}<n>A: People would be traveling to and from school.<n><n>### Input A person is driving toward the school of his choice and the benefits of college?

For example, write an original sentence of what you would say to answer the question in the previous instructions.<n><n>### Cognitive Test Tip: <n>The task is "invent a response" which is to do just that, invent a response. For instance, you might have seen the instructions for the task, and think to yourself: **I need to write a sentence for this task**. But that's not what's asked of you. The instruction to write a response just means write a response. It's very similar to a task that says "complete the task" by completing the task. <n><n>In this type of task, just writing a response that responds to the question would accomplish the task.<n><n>If you find your thinking along these lines, try thinking instead: "I need to write this in a response that responds appropriately to the question" to avoid confusing your response with the task.

Choices:  A: practice B: dexterity C: idle time D: knowledge of music E: conductor<n><n>### Response:		A: idle time<n>### Justification:<n>This question has some elements in common with the previous question that dealt with what you would be fantasizing about. It also, like the previous question, starts with a phrase stating that whatever the answer is, it probably doesnt involve or entail. <n><n>In this case, the phrase is "If you are fidding through a music book when [...] you probably don't have?" which could be interpreted a couple of different ways. <n><n>First, without context, this suggests the subject in question has probably never played through a music book, implying lack of practice. <n><n>A different way to interpret it is by removing "fidding" and examining whether there are consequences or possible causes of "fidding through a music that you probably don't know". <n><n>If the subject were fiddling through the book, it would suggest they were lacking the dexterity, or the skill to play and be able to flawlessly handle a music book. <n><n>However, neither one of the answers provided satisfy the second requirement as both, A and B, can be true and false regarding idle time, dexterity, music knowledge etc. The question is not satisfied as none of them are able to provide us with a reasonable response.<n><n>The phrase "you probably don't have", however, is something that needs to be kept in mind. Idleness will cause idle time, which is the answer we want. <n><n>So, if you start playing, you will probably lose your idle time, and your dexterity with the book as well. Thus, we can answer to the question that the most reasonable alternative is idle time.

The puzzle contains all four letters of every word in the English language, all of which are hidden in a 5x5 grid (the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal dimensions of the grid do not have to be identical). Given a word, such as "globe," you need to find the grid coordinates of all the letters within this word. You are allowed to refer to the puzzle, but you are not allowed to use any external resources, such as dictionaries. The answer to this problem is the location of the letters in a 5x6 grid. For example, a word such as "reality," with letters located at grid coordinates (2, 4), (4, 1), and (7, 6), would be deemed a valid response for this problem.

Choices:  A: library B: study area C: table D: classroom E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are several answers that could be selected, but only one answer seems to be the most logical.<n><n>11. The person is obviously attempting to reference a dictionary, which they would have taken from the study area to carry and use elsewhere. The answers that might make sence are A or B. We should look at the other answers to determine which choice would make the most sense:<n><n>- If we decide to look in B, the next question should be: What would we be looking for in the bookshelf? I would guess that we would have to look in the dictionary aisle (that would be the area where the word dictionary is present; not the area for books on education or books for children). It would be more logically sound if we looked under the aisle heading for dictionary versus the books on education. Hence, B can be disregarded.<n><n>- If we decided to look at C, it would be more logical to look in the table area. There are many areas in a classroom for books to be placed, but it seems more logical to place the dictionary on a table. The first question would obviously be: What would we take with us to a table? A table would not be an efficient place for a dictionary, as it is portable, so we will need to take the dictionary with us to a table. Hence, C can be disregarded as well.<n><n>- If the student is really using an online dictionary, or is taking an exam, he or she would not have to bring a dictionary with them. They can only select the option D, as it is the only logical answer.<n>    11.

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  answer to the riddle.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Input: Where can you find a fox when not in a forest.<n><n>### Rationales: <n>Fox hunting is a sport in which a fox is chased by hounds. A fox is found in a forest but not necessarily during a hunt, so the correct answer would likely be a) open meadow, b) arctic tundra, c) great outdoors, or d) England (where fox hunting is illegal).

Choices:  A: do enjoy B: get laid C: enjoyable D: work less E: enjoy living<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question with a complete sentence.<n><n>### Response Text: <n>- The frat guys shouted that they [will have fun tonight.](https://codingbat.com/prob/p1574475)<n><n>### Analysis:<n>There are a couple of things going on in this problem. Firstly, we've got an embedded question in our response, where the answer is a "will" statement. One way to deal with this would be to use a complete subject (He). However, using "will" as an auxiliary verb makes the sentence sounds more natural. Secondly, we have a missing subordinating conjunction after "will," that is not supplied by the author of this problem. In this case, since we have a question/answer relationship in the input, we could be more natural by choosing an answer in the form of a question. This would require an appropriate verb with the missing conjunction, so "shouted they would have fun" does the trick.<n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>### Input 2:<n>The police chief ordered his officers to come to the station and do what tonight at 8 PM? Choices: 	  A: give speeches B: run surveys C: take the exam D: go out E: clean the station <n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The input describes police officers coming to the station at 8 PM, so we know that whatever they are doing has to occur later.<n>2. The question also describes what they do as surveying, which means they are probably being asked to collect data from the public, rather than giving a speech or examining.<n>3. Taken together, these clues point strongly towards "taking the exam," as the most appropriate completion.<n>Answer: D: take the exam<n><n>### Input<n>The police chief order his officers to come to come to the station, and do what tonight, between 7 and 8 PM. Choices: A: make speech B: solve question C: take exam D: complete survey E: clean station <n><n>### Analysis<n>The police chief's orders seem to be fairly clear - the officers are arriving at the station at 8PM but they are coming to the station earlier, between 7 and and 8PM. This should provide enough clues for

Then it says "Yet inside it is warm and cosy" which is saying that even though it is raining outside and the window is wet, inside the house, the environment is cosy and warm. Thus, it illustrates how the person inside feels about the weather that is rainy outside as compared to the warm and cosy environment inside. <n>### Instructions:What is the effect that the first lines of the sixth couplet have?<n>The rhyme on the 6th and 7th line is where the words are written using the same words.

Choices:  A: sun B: sky C: candle D: house E: lamp<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question tells us that the object is "vintage," so it has existed for a long time.

The key word here is concentration, which means the absence of distractions or the ability to focus. When a student is trying to concentrate, there are almost no other thoughts that would be possible, so whatever would pop into their mind would be about the task at hand, most likely one related to school or classes. The student might think about the subject they are supposed to write down or draw a picture of, or about the teacher or classmates, or about school itself, its rules, and so on. Therefore, there would be a mixture of thoughts, but most likely some school-related ones would pop into a student's mind when they can't concentrate. The correct answer would be School-related.

Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n><n>### Response:		<n>1.The key to this question is using an inference technique, which means to understand the context of the situation and the motivations for why it would be happening. In this case, the sentence is telling us that the reader is finding it hard to start work, so the subject might not be motivated to do the job.<n>2.If the subject was excited then they should already be in a state of high energy. This makes A and D as incorrect answers.<n>3.The question refers to the act of sitting down:  "if you have trouble beginning work". Using a keyword spotting technique, we can eliminate sitting because it doesn’t relate to the motivations. Therefore, we can assume that the problem isn’t one of motivation but rather an act of sitting down.<n>4.If the subject is tired, then why would they be sitting down? Therefore, we can eliminate C and B.<n>5.If the subject begins work with no problems then why does he/she find it hard to begin work? In this situation you would eliminate E and D.<n>6.This leaves us with B, E, and F.<n>7.To decide which answer would be the most correct it is important to pay attention to the question. The question is asking "if you have trouble with beginning work, you are suffering from what? "  The reader is suffering from beginning work so there must be something holding them back.<n>8.To decide which answer was the correct answer we can look at the question "if you have trouble begin work you are suffering from what?" We can ask ourselves "Which situation would most likely keep a person from beginning work?" B sounds the most logical and thus the answer is B: 'sitting down'.<n><n>Answer: B:Sitting Down<n>

Choices:  A: become depressed B: welcome change C: thank god D: experiences E: pay bills<n><n>### Response:		<n>The clue "welcome change" suggests that we are looking for things that involve significant change. As a result, we would not expect to find someone "welcome" changes like paying bills or thanking God for their blessings. Instead, a person looking for new, interesting things in life might seek them out, which supports option C.<n><n>### Input :The thing he did as he was walking home that surprised many people that night? Choices:  I) he was angry about his job  II) he was happy  III) did it anyways  IV) left early<n><n>### Answer:<n>We learn in the text (line 3) that the subject was walking towards home. This suggests that he lived somewhere, which suggests he was away from home when the incident occurred. As a result, this is most likely occurring during nighttime. The first possibility, (I) he was angry about is his job, is easily ruled out as the subject was on the way home. He would not have been angry about his job if he was already at home. If the subject was angry at work, he would likely not be heading towards home, which is the logical conclusion. As a result, he was happy (II) was a logical solution because this would explain why he was smiling.<n>

It continues to say that "he had in mind a larger work"; however, there was an 18th century essay published by Warren named "Confederate in Europe" which was published in a magazine. So, which is it? Did he write the book, or did he write the essay?<n><n>### 2.<n>It mentions that it is an 1860's essay written by Robert Warren. So, to me, that means it is dated 1860 or possibly 1862 depending on the answer to the first point I made.<n><n>### Now, the only questions I'm left with are, did Robert Penn Warren make a 1860 book about his experience in the Civil War, or wrote the Confederate essay, did they publish in the 1800's or the 1860s.<n><n>After searching, it seems it was written either 1860-1862.<n><n>### Question: What happened to the young actor and young boy from the play "Into The Woods" when Stephen Sondheim saw them both?<n><n>### Answer<n>The young actor was 19 and was called "an unbelievable talent" by Stephen Sondheim.

They notice it after the problem occurs.<n><n>### Answer:<n>Answer 1: The word "fix" means repair, and the subject of the sentence (the person driving) notices a problem only after it was caused. Hence, the person does not notice the problem until after they tried to fix it, concluding that the correct answer must be C, change a flat tire.<n><n>Answer 2: The first question indicates that the subject will use the words given in the list to complete the sentences.

The subject in the first question mentioned in this answer is a person driving a car. Hence, the correct combination of words is a person using their car to respond to a flat tire, in which the word "car" needs to replace "vehicle" to maintain the logical structure described. Therefore, the correct answer is A, use a car as a replacement.<n>

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  C: writing a 5-page in one hour D: finishing a 5-paper application in one hour E: neither<n><n>### Rational: <n>    - He is choosing between writing a 5-pg report or finishing a 5 pg application job in 1hr. As the text said he is an account executive. He has to be able to handle reports and write letters so 5 pages wouldn't be something new to him, hence A and C is not correct.<n>    - E: neither is out because he would be able to do both in 1 hour.<n>    - Writing a 5-pg application is more difficult than writing a report that's why D is correct.<n>### Response:D.<n><n>### Insufficient evidence:<n>1. A. He’s describing his job, he would not be able to finish a 5-page application in 1 hour because he’s too busy completing reports; “account executive” is a position that handles “reports” and “letters.”<n>2. C. Finishing a 5-page Application in 1 hour is more difficult (as he mentions the 5-page job he has in his current position beforehand) than writing a report.<n>3. E.

He hadn't gotten what he needed in a long time.  He was suffering from what? Choices:  A: addiction B: fatigue C: relaxation D: headaches E: over eating<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: D: headaches<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. This question states that the subject "hurt all over," which implies both physical and emotional pain. While addiction can also have a physical component, the statement that "he hadn't gotten [what he needed] in a long time" does not imply a long term, continuous situation. This suggests a more recent event, and a more recent event suggests something that happened recently over a long period of time. Addiction is a chronic disease and so is unlikely to develop over so few hours.<n>2. The next sentence, "He was tired, he was [shaking,] and he was in pain" clearly refers to the state he was in before he got what he needed. "Was" suggests the actions happened in the past, while "tired" clearly refers to fatigue.<n>3. "He hadn't gotten..." and "he was in pain" could also refer to an injury, like a headache. While this is possible, the final sentence states that David had not gotten what he needed "in a long time." This would imply that he had gotten some help before. "Over eating" is therefore also excluded.<n>4. In summary, the most likely possibility here is the "over eating" David was likely to have gained from a meal, rather than an eating disorder, leading to headaches. Therefore, the correct answer is D: headaches, which can be obtained from the question stem and subsequent context of information.<n><n><n>### Input:"She is being treated poorly at work because she is getting older," answered a colleague.

Choices:  A; Aged B: Old C: Young D: Mature E: Beautiful.<n><n>Answer: A: Aged<n><n>### Rationale:<n>1. This problem starts with a colleague saying that she is getting older and thus receiving poor treatment at work. This suggests that she feels she is being treated unfairly in some way. This is further reinforced by the third sentence, stating her realisation that ageism is a problem in the workplace.<n>2.

Choices:  A: wrong B: death of C: bad D: negative E: evil<n><n>### Response:		A: wrong. The sentence suggests that the accused was found guilty, and thus is not guilty even if he in fact is, which contradicts the judge's characterization. A death verdict would be "death of" the accused, and this is not what the judge said. "Bad" and "evil" also do not make sense. As for "negative," this is a valid answer, but is perhaps too general to be as strongly implied as the other ones in the question.<n><n>Answer: A: wrong<n><n>### Input:"You are what you do" the man said, to the man. And they both went home together, both angry and annoyed. A: man B: men C: both D: the men E: none of the above<n><n>### Response:"You are what you did" has two words in it, which is a strong indication that the answer contains two words, too. The sentence is unclear, and therefore we can neither answer B: men, since it is unclear what "two went home together" refers to, nor E: none of the answers, since it is unclear if the words are referring to one or both of the men. The question is grammatically correct, so "you are what you did" would be the correct answer had something been omitted from the sentence. As indicated by the "and" in the sentence, there is indeed something more to the sentence, so the question should read "You are what you did. And?" <n>"A: man" is the only answer that fits, since it is the only correct answer that makes sense in the sentence. "B: both" would contradict the original sentence, as would "C: both angry and annoyed."<n><n>Answer: A : man<n><n>### Input"Do you know what I did last night?"

Because we do not know what he donated it to, our analysis should remain broad and non-specific. The answer to this question is likely to be something uncommon at a business school, but not specific to only one industry, like finance or technology. Thus, we can discount choices "B" (bank), "C" (big town), "D" (big city), and "E" (building).<n><n>II)<n><n>A second hint is given in the problem in the sentence, "this allowed them to construct a... building," suggesting that whatever is being constructed in the same sentence is what is being financed.<n><n>This allows us to eliminate choice "A" (fraternity house), which does not directly relate to the work or business world.

Choice "D" seems to be the correct choice because (1) "big" usually refers to "broad" or "large" or "large amount," indicating that the science building in question is large, and (2) given that the building will be constructed with donations from the billionaire, "big" may be a euphemism for "large" or "donated."

Choices:  A: play B: movies C: theater D: screen E: television<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct option is B: movies.

Choices: 1. A: drug manufacturer B: drug distributors C: health care providers D: pharmacies E: federal government<n><n>### Rationales<n>From the context, we can infer that the FDA is trying to do something about the issue of drugs with harmful ingredients causing a health risk for the consumers. This is one of their core responsibilities, and the statement made indicates that it is no longer working well. The term "role" can signify the actor performing this task, thus implying that the person is an agency or institution. This points to the federal government, as one way the government ensures the safety of its people is by performing duties related to their health. Therefore, the correct answer is E: federal government.<n><n>### Other Options<n>A: drug manufacturer. Drug manufacturers are responsible for checking their products for safety, but not the general public. Even if the drugs are harmful and there is an advisory, it is not the responsibility of a drug manufacturer to distribute this information.<n><n>B: drug distributors. Drug distributors are responsible for making sure there are enough prescription drugs to go around, however, FDA advisories are about drugs that are unsafe for consumption by the general public and not about drugs that might lack sufficient stock.<n><n>C: health care providers. Even though health care providers, such as doctors and nurses may use drugs, these advisories are about ensuring the safety of the general public.<n><n>D: pharmacies. Pharmacies are not expected to issue advisories, but rather to check for the safety of drugs brought to them for purchase.

What does it mean for one to take things too seriously? Choices: 1. 1 He fantasied about a what to ease his fear of a wolf attack Choices:  B: new car C: job promotion D: boredom E: friends A: a nightmare B: something ordinary C: nothing D: impatience E. pressure<n><n>### Rationales:<n>Based on multiple readings and a lot of research: The story of the boy who cried wolf is a story of someone who doesn't take threats seriously and thus overreacts to imagined ones. The phrase "He fantasized about getting a what to ease his anxieties" implies that this was what he imagined to be a real wolf's presence and thus is referring to a scenario in which he overacts. It also uses the word "to ease", indicating that the threat was not particularly frightening or threatening and was rather imaginary.<n><n>The sentence then further narrows the scenario by saying that this imaginary wolf attack might be something akin to boredom. This tells us that, based on these narrative context and the phrase used, the correct answer is: E. Boredom<n><n>#### Input: The last time I felt that nervous was when I was about to do a presentation for the first time.

I'm gonna assume the reader got one of the first five.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>(A) Texas is not north of Oklahoma unless you count the sun as being over your north pole. Also, no one from oklahoma is called okie.<n>(B)  I really don't have much to say about developed land.  But I guess if the question is really asking, "Is Texas south of developed land or not?" than the only answer would be no... and if you drove, wouldn't you just look around to see if you were south of the place you are or not?<n>(C) I'm not sure I agree that Oklahoma or Texas would not be considered the United States. But I will say that United States is more the description of United States. Unless, of course, it has to be United States when they were under Mexican control.<n>(D) Desert is the correct answer.<n>(E) Mexico may or may not be south of oklahoma, but it definitely is south of texas.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What happens when you take a shower after going for a run? Choices:  A: feeling refreshed B: becoming tired C: restlessness D: leg cramps E: sweating<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>> After going for a run, you may feel refreshed and your legs may feel less tired because they have worked hard during the run. You may experience some physical discomforts such as sweating from the body’s excessive perspiration. However, since having a shower is also beneficial for your health and may eliminate odor, it is logical to take a shower as your next action after running.<n><n>### Notes:<n><n>#### Use your brain before using a search engine<n>> Use common sense first, search engine second<n><n>#### Explanation for my Answer<n>> In the instruction, it stated a person felt refreshed after a run.<n><n>> So I thought about the different benefits of having a shower after running.<n>> I think they are<n>   - it feels good and fresh.<n>   - refresh your whole day.<n><n>> In the input, there were 5 ways to take a shower and 5 choices.<n>> So I think the best way is take a shower after a run to feel refresh.<n>> There are four different feelings.<n>   - take a shower after running can make you feel great.<n>   - feel refresh<n>   - reduce the body temperature.<n>   - sweat from whole day.<n>> But I think we should keep a good habit of shower after you are physically active and to be able to maintain good health.<n>

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:No matter the background of the person, they should all be given what in applying for the job? Choices:  A: critical thinking B: congratulated C: equal opportunity D: compliments E: raffle tickets<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: D: compliments<n><n>### Explanation:<n>When we read the prompt and the answer choices, what we're asked for is a specific action that we think should be done after an interview.<n>The prompt says "No matter the background of a person", suggesting that it is not concerned with that person's background and that there is some action that needs to be taken.<n>The answer choices are things that could be said or provided to an interviewee, and not all of them make sense in the context of the prompt. A raffle ticket is not what could be given to an interviewee after an interview, and the same can be said for the others.<n>The answer choices that do not actually make sense don't need to be read, but the answer that does work is "compliments". This makes sense in the context since one usually gives compliments for a job well done. The applicant did well in the interview, they are being complimented for it, and they should go on to the next interview.<n><n>Answer: D:<n>

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where would you stand in a line and need a coat if it is cold? Choices:  A: graph B: bank at noon C: good book D: post office E: bus stop<n><n>### Response:		<n>To figure out where your line is in in the story, think about what kind of person would have a book and a coat on a bus stop in the cold. It would definitely be someone that is on their way to the bank to withdraw some money early in the afternoon. When you think about who goes to the bank on what times and compare that to the type of person who would go to a bus stop, you will notice that the person who would go to the bank would also carry a coat with them for protection against the cold (assuming weather is cold during this time).<n><n>The best answer to the story is that they would stand in a banking line (C).<n><n>### Input:"A girl wanted a pony. How could she know that the horse was hers?"<n><n>### Demand:<n>In order to figure out how the girl can know that the horse is hers, we need to consider that the girl said that she wanted a pony. The author mentioned that the horse was the best one of its kind. In the story, a pony is generally smaller. As the best one of its type, it must also be the biggest one of its kind, too.<n><n>Hence, the best answer is that she could ride it to find out whether it is hers.<n><n>### Input"Which should come first: the chicken or the egg?"<n><n>### Response<n><n>I think the story said that the chicken would come first but it would be wrong. If we need to choose it from the book, "Which should come first the chicken or the eggs", the chicken and eggs should come together. Otherwise, neither of them is the right one for the question.<n><n>It is a matter of fact that the world was created, then the chicken did not come first.<n><n>### Response"The wind is the only thing you can't control in this world"<n><n>### Demos:<n>We need to consider what the term "control" means. It means that someone could gain power over someone else, which is not the wind.<n><n>In another sense, it could also refer to the power of the "control". We cannot control the wind because it is very powerful. The people who created airplanes and sailboats made them stronger with the wind and water as the power. But they can not truly control them. So the statement is true.<n><n>### The best way

Choices:  A: park B: motel C: corner D: bus stop E: store front<n><n>### Response:		<n>To find a trash can, you typically have to find the place that you discard your trash. This is a bit tricky, as not everyone knows where the trash goes, as it's the owner of the land that decides where to put it. You would find it in a corner if you're an owner of the land, and typically you would find it around a corner.<n><n>### Input:"You don't really feel like exercising." where did you go.

Choices: A: Long hours  B: No Benefits  C:- No Pension  D:- You risk failure  E:- You have to pay yourself before others <n><n>### Response"I would not choose to start my business if I risked failure, having to pay myself first and having no pension.

Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. John's passion of loving animals and hating animal abuse indicate that he feels strongly about animal safety and wellbeing.<n>2. The line `Where might he avoid going?` implies that John might avoid certain places or places where he knows people do not take care of animals well.<n>3. Combining what we know about John and knowing that he loves animals, his hate of animal abuse, and care for animals' wellbeing, the best option would be `parking lot`, as this is the place where we usually see many animals being hurt or killed. <n>

That's not consistent with the rest of the context, and so it's not the correct answer.<n>    * Choice B: this makes no literal sense. The couch is the only object in the situation that's giving off heat, so it's not something that can make a person feel warmer.<n>    * Choices D and E make sense in this situation. The person is wrapped up in a blanket, so they may feel a bit blushy from all of the heat, and perhaps even feel the need to cuddle with a person or other object in their vicinity. Since there is only one blanket, and the couch is the only other object in the vicinity, it's the most logical answer.<n>

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work.

The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:The child really wanted to teach his grandpa to read, he thought it was wrong that he had spent his whole life what? Choices:  A: ignore B: write C: learn new things D: illiterate E: having fun<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are a few reasons why this question could be confusing, the first is ambiguousness of the word "he wanted," while it is probably referring to the child, it does not offer any context, there is no gender hint, it could mean:<n>1. the child really wanted to do something, what was that? <n>2. the child really wanted the child to do something with his grandpa.<n>3. the child really wanted someone to teach the child something.<n>4. the child really wanted his grandpa to behave differently.<n><n>Another source of confusion would be the phrase "he ___ ____ his whole life." Here we can eliminate possibilities because some, like "learning new things" and "illiterate" would not apply to a person who had spent their entire life not doing them. "Having fun" or "ignoring" would also not apply to all of the time. The correct answer is A: "he learned something new," as the grammatical form of the last phrase, using past participles, states unequivocally.

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What would a person expect if they are competent in their school work? Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### Analysis:<n>We want to narrow down our possibilities by using a process of elimination.<n>1. An answer choice that would receive compliments would be something that is done well. This would not require any skill; if it were, it would be a learned skill. Therefore, we can eliminate A: compliments.<n>2. Stickers and avoidance of pain are both actions, neither of which requires any skill at all. If this were to be a skill, it would be a physical skill - i.e. if the assignment itself did not require any problem-solving or thoughtfulness but rather just an accurate execution of the task, one would not need to possess any specific skills and could just avoid pain altogether if they performed the assignment according to the teacher's requirements. If a student didn't understand or misread the instructions, they would not avoid pain and would end up with low marks as they completed the assignment. This doesn't seem like a useful skill so we can eliminate E: avoid pain.<n>3. This leaves B: passing grade, C: intellectual challenge, and D: sticker as realistic possibilities. We are looking for a skill, and "sticker" is just an object and not a skill, hence we can eliminate D: sticker. The question tells us we need to find a skill, and we can reasonably expect that a student competent in their schoolwork would not be able to get a passing grade without doing something. Given that they have intellect and that this is in the realm of mental work, they would need to be good at using information (intellectual challenge). Therefore, the relevant choice is C: intellectual challenge and B: passing grade.<n><n>#### Conclusion:<n>The correct answer is A: B: passing grade and C: intellectul challenge<n><n>### Input What is a thing that is most likely if we have lots of time? Choices: A: sleep B: do nothing C: eat D: socialize<n><n>### Response<n><n><n>1. The text "lots of time" is a clue that can help us narrow down our possibilities by process of elimination. If we have lots of time, we can do B) do nothing. Therefore, we can easily eliminate A) sleep and C) eat as a choice.<n>2. "to socialize" is an action as well. However the word "if" connects with the words following the

Choices:  A: bookstore B: building C: meeting D: office E: coffeehouse<n><n>### Response:		<n>I believe the sentence could be edited to be better and to provide more information about the situation. The sentence is really vague that it's hard to determine what the writer wanted to say. After reviewing the clues I come to realize maybe there was a lot of people and they all wanted to come to the same place. In that case there won't be enough chairs.<n>#### Editing<n>Change the sentence from:<n>There weren't enogh chairs<n><n>to<n><n>There were a lot of people but there weren't enough chair.<n><n>The people in the sentences and were can be deleted becuase the they are unnecessary and redundant and does not add any information or significance to the sentence.<n><n>### Response 2:<n>I believe the answer B should be delayed because it is more likely someone needs to stand because I doubt everyone uses the chairs given.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>According to the question there weren't enough chairs for everyone. We should assume there is limited number of chairs. People are looking to sit so I do not agree that the bookstore or the office should be delayed as other people may not be looking to buy any books and other people may use the office<n>#### Choice E: coffeehouse<n>I believe the coffeehouse is the best choice and should be delayed.<n><n>### Comment:<n>According to my reasoning the Coffeehouse should be delayed.<n>#### Why?<n><n>Well according to the problem "everyone" wants to come to the meeting. If there isn't enough chairs then it is likely that more people will stand or sit on the floor than use a couch.<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where can you find a place to eat and places to buy items of many different kinds? Choices:  A: city B: downtown C: own house D: bar E: shopping center<n><n>### Response:		<n>This question has seven answers, which means there are seven correct answers and no incorrect answers, as shown below.<n><n>Answers: A -> D -> C -> E -> B -> D -> A<n><n>### Reasoning:<n>1) If the input has no errors, only answer choices that match it are valid answers. These are choices A through E.<n>2) If the input has extra spaces, either before or after the choices, or a space in the middle that should be absent, or wrong characters, these are all invalid answers.<n>3) If the input has more choices than the number of choices of a place to eat and a space to buy items, then the input is invalid; there are only 7 choices in the question, so extra spaces will make all answers invalid. If the input does not have these two conditions, then there are only 1 (seven) valid answers.<n><n>### Input How do you think a computer can do this work? Choices:  C A B D E<n><n>### Response<n><n>Input: A computer can do this work by analyzing data and identifying patterns. The question refers to this work as "doing the work." While it's possible for computers to do work, they would not be able to "do the work" as described. Choices A and B each provide clues that suggest this type of work would require some kind of human effort; "give you advice" and "interact with you" can't be done by a computer alone. Choices C and D describe the same work as "gathering data," but do not specify that the computer does it. Choice E suggests human input, but is ambiguous with respect to the question of whether it would be sufficient or not. Choice C is correct, because it specifically refers to the work of finding patterns, which is something that a computer can do.<n><n>### Validation<n><n>1) If the only choices that exist are E and D, the input is invalid. This is because there are no other valid choices than these and this is the only option to select it.<n>2) If any choices that are not E or D are added, they are all invalid. This is because they are all incorrect, which would invalidate the input. In addition, the only other valid choice that exists is E, which means that any other choice will be invalid as they cannot possibly be correct.<n>3

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:If I recieve a letter from a friend over seas, why might I read it? Choices:  A: pudding B: get news C: strain D: answer E: though<n><n>### Response:		<n>E: though? I dont understand, any clues for this one?<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Input: The question is what might you read it for.<n>Rationales: You might read it for one or more purposes:<n>- To learn about it.<n>- To get news.<n>- To keep in touch or maintain contact.<n>- To keep up with what they are doing.<n>The question then clarifies that you might be reading a letter from a friend abroad. This provides even stronger hints for two purposes: <n>- To learn about where they live.<n>- To keep contact or maintain your relationship.<n>This again narrows down the list of possible options to two:<n>- To learn how their life has been while overseas. In this case, to seek knowledge of the world around them, "though" as a pronoun also suggests an analytical perspective.<n>-  To keep in touch. The subject seems friendly enough to be curious about their overseas friend. "Though" here adds nuance to our answer by suggesting that our subject is slightly distant or less friendly than they used to be. Hence we can conclude that the correct answer is B.<n><n>Answer: B: <n>In conclusion the subject seeks to know things about their overseas friends, thus, to keep in touch.<n><n>### Input : To get a better grade in his class he worked on his essay when it was due, had he been graded on a curve<n><n>### Demostration:<n>Input: To get a better grade he worked on his essays when they were due, so to get a better grade he should  have worked on them before they were due according to the logic of the question. He didn't really finish writing his essays before they were due so he had to write more when they were due. In short he is saying if the teacher graded on a curve he would have gotten a worse grade.<n><n>### Response : I don't understand, could you please explain it?<n><n><n>### Examplification:<n>Answers:<n>Input:<n>He should have written it earlier.<n>Yes,he should rewrite the essay before the deadline<n><n>### Answer A:<n>Incorrect because we learned from the question that he worked on the essays after they were due.<n><n>### Answer B:<n>The sentence states that

Choices:  A: cinema B: opera C: party D: stage E: dance<n><n>### Response:		<n>This is a question that can be answered by process of elimination.<n><n>1. We know that a performer is at work, so Cinema would not be appropriate.<n>2. A performer is a performer is work, but not always. So, stage is invalid.<n>3. A stage is for a performer during a performance. Party is also invalid since this implies a party that this performer is invited to without being a performer.  <n>4. A gathering of friends is not always one that the friends are performing for. Dance is an invalid answer for this reason.<n>5. A performer has a performance. Therefore, party cannot be the answer either.<n><n>Hence, E: Opera is the correct choice for answer 5 since it is at an Opera where a performer performs and a party is a gathering of friends.<n><n>### Input : Choose the best matching answer for the idiom<n>1.

In this scenario, there are several indicators that suggest that our subjects are thinking about something related to their job/work life, because they are driving. Additionally, we are told that the subject is fantasy about getting a something ("While driving to work the subject fantasies about getting something...") and that they are analyzing the pros and cons of whatever it is they are fantasizing (The pros and cons of....). Given the subject's apparent fascination with this new thing, we can analyze the situation and come up with plausible solutions (pros and cons of...).<n><n>One issue with the previous exercise is that no matter what the clues provided, no matter how well explained, I still couldn't tell what the "something" could be. There were too many possible things to look at (car, promotion, applesauce) and the text was very general about each of them. This is definitely a difficulty in understanding the clues.<n><n>## Instructions:  For both of the tasks above, did this exercise help you form a better understanding of what cognitive strategies you can best apply to a scenario when reading the task prompt, and applying information from the scenario text in a manner that will help you answer the problem as efficiently as possible?<n><n>## Demontration:  Yes, I think it would have been very challenging for me to successfully answer the question if my instructor had not already explained what strategy I should be looking for (the strategy being that I should take into account the clues provided in the text). To me, an exercise like this is meant to train us to identify, understand, and apply the appropriate strategies ourselves. I also found the use of these clues much more helpful than the direct instruction provided in the original question. Both strategies are useful and the most beneficial aspect would be to be able to identify the useful strategy and apply it intuitively in other situations.

Choices:  A: work in life B: speak to people C: everywhere D: sitting ideal E: care for people<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question asks about the divine role of "money" as a part of everyday interaction among mankind, and so the correct response is an explanation that relates to interpersonal communication, which is usually a component of one's work. The choices listed offer vague and ambiguous suggestions that are not logically connected to money, and so do not accurately explain what god wants people to do for money.<n>We can eliminate answer choice A immediately, as it seems to suggest that money is a "given" rather than something one works for.<n>As for answer choice B, money is typically earned through employment, the activity of getting and keeping jobs, rather than working on a life-long basis, or in the sense of working until one dies. We can also eliminate this answer choice, as it does not explain what god wants people do for money.<n>Next, let us eliminate answer choice C: nowhere does the question say that god wants mankind to speak to people. We only have the context of money.<n>Again, answer choice D may sound like money is not the intended component of interpersonal relationship, but "sitting" is a relative term that one can also sit everywhere. The correct answer would need to be something general, rather than describing some form of interaction that does not exist. "Care for people" would not make sense in this instance, either: the question does not mention caring for anybody in particular, and if this were the case, god would likely ask us to pray of them instead.<n>Finally, the correct answer is E: god wants people to interact with one another.<n>Answer: E: god wants people<n><n>### Input:(Invest $1000) Dividends: $90 Tax Rate: 40% Investment Period: 5 years?

Choices:  A: fall asleep B: headache C: boredom D: relaxation E: sick<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer: A: fall asleep<n><n>### Explanation: The question tells us that we would feel something when we go to the opera. The sentence is pretty vague and does not give us much information to work with. The word "opera" is used in two ways in English:<n><n>- it's the name of a literary form originating in Italy in the 16th century.<n>- an opera is a live performance art form in which music and singing form an integral part of the story or a particular narrative, usually performed on the stage. <n>  - There is quite some variety in how opera is performed and many things that can be experienced in an opera.<n>  - If one of our responses could be "feel sick", "feel relaxed", or "feel bored", the correct answer would be (D). As opera is an art form the question could be easily rephrased "What would you experience when you watch an opera" as (D).<n>  - If the questions would have been "What would you experience in a movie theater" or "What would you experience with a performance on stage"? The correct answer would be "fall asleep" as this could never be an option for a movie going experience or a stage performance in a live show due to the dynamic environment.<n><n>### Input A What kind of book might you give the person who has everything? Choices:  Book: 1 A: The Giving Tree B: The Diary of a Wimpy Kid C: A Book About Death<n>D: I'm with the Band E: My Life as a Potato<n><n>### Response<n><n>Answer C: A Book About death<n><n>### Explansion explanation<n>The statement is ambiguous with regards to what or who is the person who has everything. There is nothing in the question that would help us to decipher if it has to be a specific book or any kind of book. The book being referred to could be related to a person who is very wealthy, or could be something that you should give to the reader to gain their attention.<n><n>###  The main task with regards to this is to determine that the question would be: <n>  - What book would you want to recommend to someone if it would be sure they would like it?<n>  - What kind of books would you want to recommend?<n><n>### Choices:<n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where would you find a desk normally occupied by a young person? Choices:  A: office building B: schoolroom C: library D: bedroom E: gym<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is A: office building. In the US, people refer to a desk in such contexts as `office space` and `the workplace.` We can make this a more direct clue by focusing more on the location rather than the furniture:<n><n>  - "desk normally occupied by a person"  suggests that we are looking for a workplace, but again it is not a bedroom since it is too personal and intimate for most professional environments.<n>    <n>Bedroom is not the answer:  A: office space<n><n>### A final question:Can you suggest a way someone suffering from insomnia could improve their sleeping habits? Choices: A: go to a spa B: see a doctor C: get a pet D: watch TV E: listen to music<n><n>### Answer:Yes, going to a spa can help with insomnia. People tend to associate spas and relaxation with helping sleep and improving relaxation, and therefore, it makes sense that a person suffering from insomnia would benefit from this. In addition, having a pet close by during the night can also provide a sense of soothed relaxation and comfort that can lead to improved sleep habits.<n>

Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: community C: building D: prague E: every city<n><n>### Response:		<n>The most reasonable answer would be B: in a community. The main reason for this is that of the different options given, there aren't any that really make a great deal of sense. In most areas, there are distinct zones that are designed for a specific use. These include:<n>- residential zones: for housing (for example, apartments).<n>- commercial zones: for businesses.<n>- agricultural zones: for growing food and keeping livestock. These areas are located far from urbanized areas.<n>- industrial zones: for heavy industry (for example: refineries, or factories)<n><n>Schools are most certainly not located in residential zones, since it would not make sense to have a school in an area where there are multiple houses and streets for people to navigate. Likewise the same logic applies to other areas - it does not make sense to have schools in commercial, agricultural, and industrial zones as they are also not considered "communities," or residential areas.<n>

Choices A: the heart gets exhausted, B: the body can't work as fast, C: the brain gets tired, D: the legs start to stiffen, E: the nose gets stuffy<n>Rationales:<n><n>1. The question is asking about what happens when the body doesn't get enough oxygen. This suggests that the subject is talking about something that happens when one is deprived of oxygen.<n>2. The list of symptoms describes what will tend to happen when the body does not have enough oxygen.<n>3. Based on the context and the information given in the problem, since oxygen deprivation most often affects people who are sleeping, it seems likely that one of the symptoms we see in the problem is the stuffy nose or stuffy ears that one feels while going to sleep. Therefore, the correct answer is A: "the heart gets exhausted, because the body does not get as much oxygen as it needs."<n>Answer: A: the heart gets tired<n>

Choices:  A: ordering dog food online B: avoid eye contact C: feel guilty D: fall asleep E: blush<n><n>### Response:		<n>Ordering dog food online is not a common sign that someone's lying.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>- This is an odd-looking response to a straightforward prompt. While it fulfills the instructions to provide an response, it doesn't directly address the questions posed.<n>  - The instruction asks us to come up with a response, but the rationale is that the response we provided doesn't seem to follow the question. We could have directly written the response "Ordering dog food online isn't a common sign that someone;s lying" or elaborated the rationale by explaining why this response doesn't fulfill the task.<n>- The instruction asks us to respond by writing a single, complete sentence; rather than providing a one-word answer. We can provide a response fulfilling the task but fulfilling the instructions too.<n><n>### Response 2:<n><n>- The instruction describes a task of choosing the most likely sign that someone is lying. It does not provide an exact description of this sign, however one can determine the possible answers by considering the phrases within the instruction.<n>- The choices are phrased in such a way that they could conceivably be the signs that someone is lying. Since we're given multiple choices, we can't discard them from the start. However, we can eliminate some options as less likely than the others by considering how unusual those choices would be and whether they fit the context within the question.<n>- We can conclude that falling asleep or blushing in response to a lie are very unusual. They do not logically fit the context, which is that someone is lying and looking for signs for confirming this.<n>- We can also conclude that avoiding eye contact and feeling guilty are more likely to be signs that someone is lying, since a person who's lying would avoid looking at or mentioning something related to the truth of their lie, or feeling guilty for doing something they otherwise wouldn't be ashamed of doing.<n>- In terms of this latter criteria, we can consider whether ordering dog food would be something a person would feel guilty at ordering. To order dog food seems to be a normal activity without a strong emotional response, unless the person feels guilty or self-conscious for ordering it. A person ordering dog food could be guilty for not owning a dog, but if ordered to a person with a dog then this isn't the case. Ordering

Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Bob is in a dressing room.  He's putting on waterproof trunks and goggles.  What sort of facility is he most likely visiting? Choices:  A: swimming pool B: actors and actresses C: fancy restaurant. D: gym E: theatre<n><n>### Response:		Bob is visiting the most likely scenario being a swimming pool.<n>##### Rationales:<n>1. The term swimming pool is an ambiguous term in English in that it can refer to a number of similar things or facilities, and the difference between them relies on context and other words in the sentence.<n>2. "goggles" strongly suggests some sort of swimming equipment, as goggles would be something one would wear while swimming.<n>3. Furthermore, the context of this sentence leads me to believe that Bob is "in a dressing room, putting on" an item of clothing, which would be a piece of swimwear in contrast to what one "would not find" in an actors dressing room (actor).<n>4. This is further supported by the fact that Bob can only "put on" (this is very literal) "trunks" and "goggles", which would be necessary to swim in.<n>5. Finally, as the question asks "What sort of facility is he visiting?", the question does not refer to what Bob is doing after visiting the facility, but rather the facility itself. This narrows down the possible choices to things that act as swimming pools/things related to swimming.<n>6. The answer does not refer to the reason for Bob's visit, but rather the type of facility he is visiting, so if the answer did refer to his reason for visiting, it might possibly be a swimming pool for exercise and fitness, since it provides the question that Bob is putting on goggles and trunks.<n>7. In the end, the most likely interpretation is that Bob is visiting a swimming pool, as it is the only possible facility that a swimmer might visit, and as Bob specifically puts on swimming related items, he is most likely visiting a swimming facility.<n><n>### Input :He fantasized about his future job : Which of these jobs would require him to deal with lots of paperwork?

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits. Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What does someone chatting with friends do when they hear a joke?

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:The artist knew that this was the peak of his fandom, so he decided it was time for cashing in by doing what? Choices:  A: selling out B: happy C: fishing D: receiving money E: getting paid<n><n>### Response:		<n>The artist decided to sell out to get more paid.<n><n>### Rationales:<n>The question gives us several signs to analyze the answer. The phrases "time for cashing in" and "selling out" are almost identical, implying that the subject is looking for more money by taking actions related to his artistic activities.<n><n>The first phrase is also prefaced with an expression of time that puts it in the past. We know that the actions we took at a time in the past led us to another place or state, so these actions were also performed in the past, which further supports the analysis that the subject is selling out to get more money.<n><n>The term "happiness" is used in the question itself, and is also used in the context of the artist's actions, implying their irrelevance. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that what is being analyzed does not relate to happiness or artistic expression at all.<n><n>Furthermore, we know that our answer will not be a physical activity. The word "fishing" is a valid English word, which shows that in the sentence it does not refer to the activity of catching things by hand in the water with a hook.<n><n>Answering questions, we have come to understand that the correct answer is "selling out to get paid".<n>

Choices: 1: Homeowners do not keep up with their payments on their mortgage. 2: Rising interest rates mean that borrowers pay more for their home loans over time or they cannot qualify for a loan. 3: Housing prices stagnate or even fall. 4: Foreclosure rates increase. 5: Homebuilders are unable to sell their inventory. 6: People decide not to move or buy a home.  Rationales:1. Because we want to avoid listing all of the choices, we will pick the ones that best describe an increase in risk and that are relevant to the question - these are 1 and 3 which both describe a situation in which housing prices fall.<n>2. Answer 1 and 2 match the second option, 2, and answer 3 and answer 6 match the fifth option, 6.<n>3. Now we know that the answers listed here are either an increase or a decrease in risk. 1 (homeowners do not make payments) and 3 (housing prices fall) both describe decreases. 2 (interest rates increase) and 6 (people do not buy a home) both describe risk increases. 5 (homebuilders cannot sell homes) and 6 (no one wants to move) both describe a decrease in risk.<n><n>### Input:- He was in awe of the amount of money that a successful business could make with a good marketing campaign. - Why would it be better to spend money on a campaign that made the public aware of your product than by making the decision to put the money in the bank?

Choices:  A: dimly lit room B: kitchen C: wall D: table E: birthday cake<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Demonstration:Input: Who is a good candidate for a work from home position? Choices: .A: introverts B: extroverts C: sociable individuals D: people who dislike being confined to their desks<n><n>## Rationale:  1. The text asks who makes a good candidate for work from home position. As it is not specific, it should be assumed that the position would either allow someone to work from home or it would require the person to work from home. If the position required a specific quality from those who took the job, the question would be "Which of the following is a job requirement...". 2. Since the word "candidate" is used, the assumption is that this is an employee or perhaps a prospective one. Employing someone for the first time would require knowing them on a basic level. The only things that are explicitly defined in this statement, and are thus knowable, are personality traits.  3. Since both B&C are positive personality adjectives, we can rule out A, the negative adjective. When you hear either A or B, you will feel one way about the candidate: either she isn't introvert enough, or not extrovert enough. 4. When you hear D or E, you will feel one thing: that the person is somehow wrong, averse, or unlike the other people working there. 5. Thus, the only answer that provides no negative feelings is C.  6. So, the answer would be D: sociable. <n><n><n>## Input:Which of the following could be considered an example of effective delegation? <n><n>## Demonstraion:<n><n>## Input: Where would you find a candle?

The word "difference" gives away the fact that this will not be a multiple choice question.<n>2. The word "that" suggests that something that exists in a mammal can also exist in a non-mammal, but probably to a different extent. We can thus expect "non-mammal" to have some adaptations, and it's reasonable to assume that since it's from the ocean, those would have to be in relation to its ocean environment.<n>3. To expand on previous step, the adaptations can be interpreted as either some sort of quality or characteristic, or the process by which that quality or characteristic is manifested. This is a slightly different question type but it has a close enough relationship that it can be interpreted in a similar manner<n>4. Looking at the two options, the correct answer is D: Process.<n>Answer: D: Process

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: fullness B: underwear C: bad breath D: better day E: dirty dishes<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is C.<n><n>### Explain your answer:<n><n>You could have guessed that "underwear" was the answer just with a small logic deduction and some analysis of the word usage. The question suggests a large family, so the piles of dishes may be more due to people not bothering to clean their dishes than a result of a large family, so that answer is out. The question also has the word "dishes," but the context leads one to consider other types of garbage, so that answer is also out. Likewise, the words "with a large family" could be used figuratively, implying that family members frequently eat together, which doesn’t fit well with the image of a sink pile and bad breath.<n><n>As for "fullness," it has a physical interpretation, so it is excluded as well. "Fullness" might be a reason for "dirty dishes," but this would not suggest bad breath being the most likely side-effect. "Better day" would also make a better answer because it conforms to the context. And "dirty dishes" itself, though used loosely and figuratively, and also does not fit well with the image and physical interpretation of "bad breath" from eating so much. It fits best with "dirty dishes."<n><n>If you look carefully, the word "underwear" is listed twice in the question, which is a clue that it is the best answer, and this is also confirmed by using the context of what the question is asking about. "Underwear" may be the result of a large family rather than being related to eating breakfast, as it is mentioned more in references to eating breakfast.<n><n>

This means that its benefits are related to an individual. Thus, any benefits would be focused on the pets themselves, which would be the correct answer, "It's easier to find."<n>* The phrase "It's lighter to..." could refer to any number of options, such as carry something or balance on the tip of a toe.

Choices:  a. stand still b. standing still c. wallflower d. dance like crazy e. like dancing<n>```<n><n>* Input: The boy was too nervous<n>* Demonstration: He was progressively standing still <n>* Conclusion: I had to think for a few minutes to narrow down the answer. The boy was doing progressively at this ball? I wasn't sure exactly what the phrase meant, and I don't think the context made it any more obvious. I needed more hints that this wasn't a simple question of asking him to dance.<n>* Key: the phrase "progressively" meant he was getting steadily better at standing still. "standing still" is a phrase you could use to describe someone standing completely still. That gave me the idea to replace standing still with "standing," which made a lot more sense. So the boy was progressively doing what at this ball?

The original question didn't include any information about what type of dance it was. The boy was doing this "at the ball" and the clue was that he was nervous, so it could be anything from a waltz to a salsa, for example.<n><n>### I have had several questions along these lines in my exams and was a bit confused by it. I do not know why it should be called progressive verb tense! I'm not an expert on English grammar, but I don't know why I need to know this.<n><n>#### My question: how am I suppose to know that I had to look for "progressive verb tenses", instead of, say, the use of "progressively" to mean

This tells us that whatever is described is something that such a person feels or experiences on a regular basis.<n><n>As for the rest of the question, we can look for some clues in the descriptions provided:<n><n>- "early death," however, would seem to be too great of a burden for anyone to bear, let alone experience frequently. This answer does not make sense.<n>- "valuable" also sounds too strong an adjective to be appropriate to the context, so we can rule it out early.<n>- "joy" is not something that one "feels" specifically, and is more of a broad emotion; we can discard A.<n>- "happiness" is a more general feeling than what would be expected of an individual experiencing life fully, and might refer to the feelings of someone whose life has gone smoothly in general as opposed to being extraordinary or extreme. B does not seem to fit.<n>- "adventurous" sounds far too positive, optimistic, and exciting to refer to feelings experienced regularly. It would indicate a person with an unusual amount of courage, drive, or thrill-seeking behavior, which does not appear to be the impression we are supposed to get from "living life fully." D also does not work.<n><n>That leaves us only with E, which refers to something that is exciting or remarkable, which might indeed be the feeling one would get from a rich, vibrant, and full life. This is supported by the choice of "life fully." Thus, the correct answer to the question is E: adventurous.<n>Answer: E: adventurous

The accountant determined that the boy's father earned more money from his job and should pay for college. 2. The mother had worked at home for the past two years and did not care to pay for college. 3. The boy's father earned less money and so he would only pay half of the college. 4. She argued that if her husband had been working instead of being at home he could have been earning more so she should only pay half. 5.

Choices:  A: population B: populated area C: create government D: group of people E: make person sick<n><n>### Response:		<n>Society cannot exist on their own.   They only rise within the population.  <n><n>### Rationales:<n>The question is very specific in that it describes both the type of entity to be mentioned, numbers, and the location in which numbers may exist, i.e. spaces. It might not be clear at first, but this suggests that we need to describe two different locations where the specific entity can be contained, one being "a population" and the other "a population of."<n><n>The key to finding the correct answer is to look carefully at the wording and determine what kind of spatial relationship it suggests—"numbers" can be "within" or "in" a specific type of entity, but what entity does the word "they" refer to?  The clues we have are "cannot...exist without..." and "rise up...in what sort of spaces."<n><n>Given these two facts, we can infer that "they" must mean "numbers" because they "exist without...any space." However, they only "rise" when "numbers are contained" within populations. Numbers arise within "populations" but they do not arise within the population area itself; otherwise the phrasing would not make sense. So the correct answer has to be either A or C.<n><n>Considering that the subject is a collective unit, we can eliminate D. Although it refers to "individuals," "group" is probably not referring to an individual group of people, but instead a larger group of people, such as a society. So we have to eliminate D. This leaves us at a choice between A and C.<n><n>The question states that numbers only rise up in "what sort of spaces?", with the spaces themselves being of a specific form—they must be "a population." Because numbers can only be conceived of as a part of a population, the numbers must necessarily be "within" a population, so our only choice remaining is C: population. The best answer is C: "a population."<n><n>Answer: C: population

Bridge can refer to being a bridge among people or things, but it is more commonly meant as a physical structure that supports or spans a gap.<n>2.

This indicates a structured arrangement that is sequential or organized, what are normally present when looking at a physical structure like a bridge or the column sections of a classical column or colonnade.<n>3.

Choices: 1: a car ride 2: ride the car 3: a car 4: a ride 5: car ride answer: 1: a ride<n><n>### Demostration:<n>The question asks us whether a car ride away from a beach should be called a "car ride", thus prompting us to consider the answer being a term related to a car. We are not given a location (beach), nor a specific activity for the car ride (for example, a drive, commute, trip, etc.) Thus we cannot immediately determine the likely candidate to be the correct answer.<n><n>However, the context can help us narrow our options. The beach is a common subject found in summer activities, implying that the car ride would most commonly take place during summer. Also, it is most likely that the car ride is away from the beach (such as in order to reach it), since otherwise it wouldn't make much sense to ask for the name of such a ride. This narrows our options even more, as it would be unlikely to be called a "car drive", a "car trip", "car commute", or "car drive".<n><n>In addition, the options are very obviously nonsensical given the situation or the terms themselves. For example, it would not be called a "ride the car" (as this sounds like the ride is inside the car), a "car" (as this sounds more like a name for the car), or a "car ride" (again, this sounds like the name of the car). Thus, only the answer 1, a "ride", makes logical sense within the given terms and context, and it is thus the correct answer.<n>

The fact that they were arrested together suggests that they were arresting each other in a way, or the implication would be that they were jointly arrested.<n>2. The next part, where the question asks if they were arrested at the same time or near each other, suggests that they were in a similar state of being arrested.<n>3.

For example, "Yesterday, John ran very slowly.” In this case,'very slowly' is adverbial phrase(S) explaining how John was running(S) in yesterday.<n><n>## Multiple Choice Question 3<n><n>>Input: Who are the people involved in the process of writing a story? Choices:  Choose “b” or “a” and write “a” if it is a verb or choose “b” if it is a pronoun.<n>><n>>Rationale:  “who” can be replaced by “________” is a pronoun while “who is” is in the form of verb “is”.<n><n>### Which among the following is NOT an example of adjectival phrase(s)?<n>><n><n>>Answer: The question says that adjectival phrase is a clause that contains the subject and modifies a noun/pronoun which is the objective. In this case, there should be a clause that modifies a noun. Following are the answers:<n><n>```<n>“Yellow flowers are pretty”<n>“My friend’s name is John”<n>“A girl who we love the most”<n>“The man, whom we trust to always be there”<n>“John, was my friend”<n>“The person, we always support”<n>"Happy people, we admire most"<n>```<n><n>## Multiple Choices Question 4<n><n>### The problem below describes the task of editing a video by removing some clips.

Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Rationales: 1. The question tells us that the subject is fantasizing about something while driving to work. This suggests that whatever they are fantasizing about is future-oriented and probably related to their job or work life.<n>2. The phrase "pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits" also provides a substantial hint. We can analyze it piece by piece:<n>    - "extra responsibilities" suggests an increase in the level of accountability or tasks, what would not arise from getting a new car, experiencing boredom, impatience, or pressure.<n>    - "benefits" often refers to advantageous or positive results from something, and is commonly used in a work context to refer to employee benefits. This narrows our possible answers even more, leaning towards something related to career advancement.<n>3. Taking into account the context and the analysis of the clues given in the problem, the most logical answer would be "promotion," as this is something one would fantasize about during a commute and indeed has both extra responsibilities and potential benefits.

Choices:  A: run B: swimming C: calculate things quickly D: fight enemy E: urinate<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: An animal must what in order to maintain balance while running quickly? Choices:  X: have four legs Y: have six legs<n>Rationales: I would like to give my reason in terms of physics here, because that's what it's based on. When you look at the question, you must realize that this is about an animal walking, which we all know is a two-legged process (the quadrupedal example is incorrect, as all four legs do not touch the ground at the same time, and are always in motion simultaneously in a way that is very different than bipedal motion). So the question is really asking, given that this animal needs to move using only two legs, what other mechanisms must be employed in order to maintain coordination while going rapidly? Now here are the possible answers, and a logic behind why these are incorrect.<n>     - A: Have Four Legs: This is not a correct answer because the question asks what animals must do in order to balance when moving quickly on two legs.<n>     - B: Have Six Legs: This is also not a correct answer, because this would apply to animals with more limbs than just their main legs. As an extension from this is the question regarding four legs and six legs, the animal would be expected to have four limbs. So this answer doesn't make sense either.<n>     - X: Have Four Legs. This is not a correct response because while the animal does need to walk with the main two legs that the question is about, the animal still needs to walk even with the two secondary legs that it has. This is what the question is asking: given that the animal has to walk on two legs, what else must be done to keep the animal balanced? So, without even thinking, one has to note that the animal must keep walking using the second set of legs, which are also on two legs. This is why this answer is incorrect.<n>     - Y: Calculate Everything Quite Quickly. This is not a valid response because the question doesn't mention that the animal needs to think a lot, although calculating could be the way to avoid an accident from balancing. All in all, this is definitely not a valid response.<n>     - D: Fight the enemy quickly. This is not a possible response because that doesn't at all answer the question.<n>Finally, we have the correct answer, which is in fact the

Choices: A: read B: exercising C: doing what is relaxing D: watching television E: being with friends F: none of the above<n><n>### Rationales: A. None of the Above:  First, we should notice that "he would unwind" is being replaced by "he does," which creates an indication that the subject is present. This is further reinforced by phrases such as "watching television" that clearly refer to recent activities. Thus, the subject isn't reading or doing anything relaxing; they are watching TV.<n>B. Exercising:  Next, we should see that the phrase "watching television" is not a verb, which can't precede the present participle "exercising." The subject is either watching TV or exercising, and exercising is clearly indicated.<n><n>C. Reading: The phrase "reading" also doesn't precede the verb "doing," which is a bit clearer because it means performing activities and thus is related to doing something. In either case, the verb phrase being used is a little funny, which indicates that there was at least one error, suggesting there is one answer that is at least partially wrong. As the verb "doing" cannot be referring to exercising, this leaves only one option: D: watching television<n><n>D. None of the A above: The most telling clue is the phrase "doing what is relaxing," which states explicitly that the subject is doing something. In either scenario, "reading." "watching TV," or "exercising," the subject is performing a specific activity and therefore cannot be doing what is relaxing. To find an answer, we need to use logic that goes against what is being suggested.<n><n>As the subject is relaxing after working at a computer all day, it would be very counterintuitive to

Choices:  A: great B: distinguished C: remarkable D: excellent E: peculiar<n><n>### Response:		The answer to the question is "E: peculiar."The answer is to be derived by going through the various phrases in the question. In the question, we are told that Sally took her medicine and then we find out that there were side effects. In order for someone to think a side effect is something to be "great," "distinguished," "remarkable," or "excellent," there must have been a pre-existing thought that some other medication, or a specific effect of a different medication may have been very good, excellent, or perfect. This is not the case in the following sentence when Sally took medication she experienced a whole bunch of different side effects. As the phrase "a bunch of" implies that Sally experienced many different side effects to her medicine, none of these side effects were perfect. Hence, the correct and only right answer is "E: peculiar," as this is the only phrase that makes sense.<n><n>### Input answer: John had a busy afternoon so he planned a few things.

We can deduce that there are unplanned things which is the left over activities or residual. Planned things take priority over the unplanned ones.<n>- The time has passed by, so it can be deduced that John had a busy day, so he would not spend time on unplanned activities.<n>- The answer must be the first things in the list of activities<n>- He did something to relax himself as he had a busy day; which is D - to take a bath<n><n>### Conclusion: We conclude that John answered the question

This suggests that we are dealing not just with a pen (i.e., a concrete object), but also with some particular context, in which we can say the subject "can buy the pen." Hence, the subject will probably be buying the pen, meaning that we will have a question that asks about the activity in which the subject engages.<n>The text makes an announcement: "You can buy a pen," suggesting that there are different locations where a pen can be bought.

Choices:  A: company B: airport C: wall D: computer network E: love<n><n>### Response:		<n>This is a tricky one! The question begins with "James was delayed for a connection," which is a common term for a layover. Usually, a layover is used when flying from multiple terminals at an airport, but the answer that the question is looking for is not airport. The answer, instead, is likely a computer network. For example, "I had a DNS issue so my connection was delayed for a couple hours, and I had to log into the company WiFi to get it fixed," which is a realistic problem that I have run into multiple times while traveling. The use of "connection" in the prompt indicates a type of connection or network, rather than any form of physical connection. In this way, the answer that the word refers to is almost certainly a computer network.<n>

C) near a bus stop near a fire station. D) at one fire station and a water fountain. E) at one fire station near a fire station that is outside of a water fountain near a military base.<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>1. People often stand near a line which is why you see them standing on a line. They often stand at a line near an outside bus stop or a water fountain where they usually stand around at a fire station. In this case, it is logical to stand at a fire station since it is near a bus stop or water fountain outside. We can answer choice C: near a bus stop near fire station.<n>2. Similarly, in choice B: outside the fire station near the bus stop and near the water fountain, people often stand near the military base that is next door to the fire station.

He had a 3-foot long, three-sectioned steel pole, and was pushing it towards a fence next to a large garage. As he pushed the pole towards the fence, it slid into a three-sectioned steel fence pole, bent it and caused the fence to collapse. When the fence collapsed, it fell across a parked car, crushing and injuring an elderly couple in the car. The boy ran home, crying and his mother was called. Upon hearing what had just taken place, his mother told the police that her son must be punished, and the couple must be paid reparation for the damage to their car. At the trial the judge gave her a long lecture about her unjustified cruelty to the boy, and sentenced her to 3 years of probation. Upon appeal this verdict was upheld.  <n><n>## Input:- A person might feel sorry to a person they have helped or hurt. <n><n>## Task:- Write the correct choice to answer the question.

Choices:  A: library B: parties C: kindergarten class D: bar E: school<n><n>### Response:		<n>This response states that if a student was about to be released from kindergarten, their schooling would come to an end.<n><n>### Rationale:<n>The response correctly interprets the clue "they would no longer be atteding school,". This points to a time in which the student is no longer in school - when they graduate. Furthermore, when a student graduates, it is commonly understood that they are no longer able to continue attending their previous school. Since kindergarten classes involve a certain level of on-going schooling, the response accurately states that graduating from kindergarten class would not allow one to continue attending kindergarten. This implies that you would no longer be able to attend kindergarten.<n><n>### Input<n>How old is the oldest child?

There are a number of possible answers, so we must rule them out as we go and use logical analysis, such as elimination.<n><n>### First question<n><n>The question asks "what is the most efficient way..." This means we must be looking for a process that is quick and easy to implement.<n><n>### Second question<n><n>The question is what the most common way to "start a sentence" is.

Choices:  A: hang in closet B: sniff C: get dirty D: become soiled E: air out<n><n>### Response:		<n>This question is very similar to the one above, but with a different context. In this case, a hypothetical subject cannot wash their smelly clothes, and they are wondering whether they should just hang them in the closet or keep wearing them.<n><n>First, let's analyze the question text.<n>1. The sentence "if clothes have developed a smelly do not be able to wash what should one do with them," suggests that the subject is concerned about clothes that have developed a smell.<n>2. This suggests that the answer to this question should be "hang them in a closet" or "don't wash them."<n>3. After narrowing this down to the answers "hang them in a clostet" or "don"t wash them," we ask how we can narrow that down further. This means that the most logical answer would have to be one that suggests they shouldn't wash them.<n>4. "air out" suggests that the smells should only come from bacteria or something similar. This means that the subject shouldn't wear dirty clothes, and their clothes should be washed.<n>5. "Soiled" is often used in relationship to food, not clothing. "Get dirty" should have been used, but didn't quite work in this case.<n>6. The phrase "a smell and can'tn be washed" implies that there isn't anything wrong with the clothes except for a bad smell. This means that they can be washed.<n>7. The subject cannot decide which answer is right. Hence, the most logical answer to this question would be "hang in the closet," as this would prevent the subject from getting a bad smell on them by wearing dirty clothing. The correct answer is C: don't wash them<n><n>### Input <n><n>Your friend, who is a fan of a fantasy football league, asks when your fantasy team plays.

Choices:  A: intelligence B: education C: effectiveness D: distress E: a stupid<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question asks us what might the inability to _learn_ cause.

This leaves us with only a few options (the correct one "intelligence" is one, but the others are also correct in some cases):<n><n>- "educatio" can refer to education or a reduction in someone's quality of _education_<n>- "effectiveness can refer to the resultant effectiveness or effect. Because this is often the case, the options are narrowed down to "education" as a learning outcome and "effectiveness" as an effect on an outcome, but in either case does not change the fact that it is a result of not learning.<n>- Distress can refer to emotional state, but the other keywords cannot refer to such state, but rather the other aspects discussed - intelligence, education, and effectiveness.<n><n>We therefore have distress as an answer, but it may also refer to an emotional state, which is why there are two answers.<n>Answer: A: intelligence<n><n>### Instructions:What are some characteristics of someone who is disinterested in learning?

A keyword is "disinterested," which means, literally, someone who does not share an interest or is uninterested. This is commonly used in a context of work, when someone "is uninterested in learning something."<n><n>Let's break down what it says: someone is uninterested, which means they are disinterested, or they disinterested on something.

In this case, trunk refers to the luggage container on a car. <n><n>The trunk should refer to where you would put luggage in a car on short trips. <n><n>Answer: D: trunk<n>

Choices:  A: nice feeling B: good karma C: respect D: new freedom E: good heart<n><n>### Response:		<n>[1]<n>Forgiveness is one of those words that seem to come with heaps of baggage — and for good reason. One of the most hurtful words in any language (next to, perhaps, "unconditional love"), forgiveness implies blame. Saying you forgive someone implies an admission that the relationship you once had was damaged, but that you’ve made a conscious decision to not let what happened get in the way of a future relationship. So, if you’re willing to admit guilt — and take blame — to make sure everything stays smooth, why shouldn’t the person you’ve forgiven do the same? What else can you expect?<n>[2]<n>The most common example of a hidden force activated after a period of time spent working on forgiveness is that of a person who no longer struggles with anger, as opposed to someone who struggles with anger and continues to struggle with forgiveness.<n>It's probably best to ask yourself, "how long ago did I start this journey?" If it's been a year or two, it's probably not a great day to have the forgiveness process derailed. If it's been more than five years, then there is no reason to feel like you are going to lose what you have achieved.<n>[3]<n>But, in the same vein, there is a good possibility that the most important thing to do on that first day is to give yourself permission to be forgiven, for the way you have chosen to live your life from this point forward regardless of what it was before. Forgiveness is not easy - and it doesn't happen right away - but it is the first step. It may not be the most important step, or the easiest step, but it's a very big one.<n>[4]I think that the forgiveness you desire has gotten so stuck inside of you that you cannot move it forward - your heart wants to forgive, but your mind is the one that says it's not possible. When I forgive I make a mental commitment to myself that I am 100% committed to forgiveness.<n>The second step is forgiving your thoughts, even though we have no control over them.<n>A third step you can take on your journey is learning to truly forgive yourself. This is important because many people do not really forgive themselves, thinking that they are wrong or

Choices:  A: ink in B: caps C: ink cartridges D: take notes E: scribble<n><n>### Response:		<n>I would check the pens to see if they’re working. If they aren’t, I would have to ink a pen. If they are still not working properly I would need to replace the ink cartridge and then I would write notes in my notebook.<n><n>### Explanation:<n>#### Rationale:<n>In the answer you suggested, I first notice the word ink. In this instance, caps or ink cartridges would be incorrect because ink is a noun not a verb. The only two things that involve ink in the context would be ink and notes. The question states that ink won't work. This is telling me that I would need to replace it.

In the second sentence, the word "job" refers to an occupation; a job "may not have a lot of" money, but will "help advance your career". The speaker is presumably concerned about money for this job, and it "may not have a what?"  Answer: B: money.<n>Answer: B

Hence, the correct answer is B: promotion.<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Why might someone want to be buying beer? Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n><n>### Response:		<n>The word "beer" is ambiguous, so the answer can't be "buying beer" as per the instruction. The subject "someone" refers to someone who is driving, so the sentence is talking about drinking and driving. This narrows the options and "intoxication" seems most appropriate, so the correct answer is D: intoxication.<n><n>### Input<n>Why might someone want to drive on the wrong side of the road? Choice: A: get arrested B; no more left turns C: no more right turns D: they do not know better<n>Rationales<n>1. The word "want" has a vague meaning, and can be used to talk about the subject's thoughts, motivations and intentions. In this case, the choice options suggest that there are many reasons a driver might be driving on the wrong side of a road.<n>2. When "someone" drives down the left lane instead of the right one, this is often called a "left turn", as the correct flow would be a left turn first, then a right turn. When describing this as "a left turn" rather than "a turn of any kind", the implication is that the left turn is the only option for the driver in terms of traveling in the right direction. This suggests that the subject might not know any better, since driving on the wrong side is an option because they can't make a left turn; if there were no left options, they wouldn't be able to "get arrested" and they would just follow the traffic flow (so they'd be "doing what most people would expect"). Thus, the only possible answer is C: no more left turns.<n><n>### Response<n>The question states why someone might want to drive on the right side even though they are aware they will get arrested, and the answer tells us why they might still be driving on the wrong lane. The sentence structure would read "Why they might drive on the left side, instead of the right, even after they get arrested", and the correct question is "Why would someone drive on the left lane instead if the correct option?"<n><n>### Input <n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.

Choices:  A: make noise B: have tea C: make time D: make payments E: take time<n><n>### Response:		C: make time<n><n>### Explaination:<n>We can see from the context that the question is about something you do in a bank, which could refer to different types of activities. However, taking into account the title of the question "What is something you do in a Bank?" and the following statement "What is something you get from a bank?" We can deduce that this question is about an activity that one gets from a bank.<n><n>The options are A: make noise, B: have tea, C: make time, D: make payments and E: take time. <n>Let's analyze each one separately:<n><n>* Make Noise - A: Can be done in the office or even in the bank lobby, where customers come to make their banking transactions, so not related to the bank environment.<n>    <n>* Have tea - B: It's unlikely that anyone gets tea in a bank lobby, more likely that it it is offered when a customer is in the bank office with an employee.<n><n>The rest of the choices can be eliminated based on whether they can be done while inside or near the bank or if they refer to an activity related to taking out the bank card, making a deposit or withdrawing money.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is D: make payment.<n><n>Answer: D: make payments<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice questions.<n><n>### Example:<n><n> Input: She was asked the question "how are you making a difference?" and the pros and cons that she had?

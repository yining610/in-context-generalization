If your program runs, your answer is accepted.<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>In your main method, try each possible input (see below). For each one, print which choice you would select and why.<n><n>## Instructions:<n>1.	In your main method, print out the first three lines that were written for you.<n>2.	Read in the first line - A sentence<n>3.	Divide the first line into three sentences using semi-colons. Each sentence will start with: A:	Where could you find some X that would not be of any use to you if you were thirsty? B:	When would you expect to see X? C:	Where would you expect to see some X?<n>4.	Take the first sentence from each line and create three variables to store those sentence for use in a 3 way comparison which will determine your answer. Declare the variables like so: int answerA;	string answerB;	string answerC;<n>5.	Take the remaining lines (lines 3-5), and for each line (lines 4 and 5) separate the sentences into different variables by removing ':' and the colon (:) from the string, then the variables contain the 3 way comparison for the sentences from the variable. The variables for line 4 could be: string line4a; string line4b; string line4c<n>6.	The third string that will contain the 3 way string comparison for the sentences from line 4 is line5. These could be variables like so:<n>string line5a; string line5b; string line5c<n>7.	Create a new "switch" statement between line 6 and line 7 that handles your 3 way comparison and then choose one of the options you want.<n>8.	Print out the "switch" statement and all your variables.<n>9.	Once you have your strings formatted according to what you want, then simply run the program and see if the print out is the way you want it to be.<n>### Instruccion:<n>### Instrucciones:<n>1.

Then the options are:  * A: oil refineres,* is a place where you wouldn't find any plumbing at all, because oil refineries just produce oil and don't provide any water so there's no usage of water in that place. * B: Wall,* there's a lot of plumbing in walls and it's used for everything like showers and bathrooms so it's not the place where you haven't any plumbing.  * C: Show, *is not the place to use plumbing as well, because it's not used for any of the purpose as above.  * D: Own home, *this would be the place if the options are about places to use any type of plumbing. But it still doesn't need much of usage if you're thirsty. So it's not correct.  * E: water fountains, *there's no much plumbing in water fountains, they are used for getting the taste of water directly. So, they aren't much of using the plumbing.<n><n><n><ul><n><li><cite>Hint:</cite> You can use  <code class="cmd" name="cmd" value="a" /> to select only the correct answer.

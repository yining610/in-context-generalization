This will show you that the first digit (not including 0, as the data is only 0-9) will give insight into what type of image we are dealing with. If we do this, we'll find that the most common digit is a 4. Next, look at the next most common digit (excluding the previous), and then the next. You may or may not find different digits occurring the most depending on the data, and you should examine as many of the most frequently occurring digits as you can. Doing this, we'll notice that the digits 0 and 5 occur equally, but that 4 is by far the most commonly occurring digit.\n\nThen, you will:\n* Calculate pairwise correlations between these features.\n\nYou will find that there are strong correlations between the data and these features, and that this correlation is strong regardless of what you pick (so, even if you find only a single feature there are significant correlations).

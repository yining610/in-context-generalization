Choices:  A: hill B: gorge C: sandplain D: cliff E: mountain<n>Output:		A: hill<n><n>Note in the examples below the words the person is thinking when they are answering the questions.<n><n>```<n>A: Where could you find something that wouldn’t be useful if someone is thirsty? <n>1. I know! I know! I know something right now! Throwing cold water on someone! I don’t think about being thirsty. I’m having water or some juice or something right now. And I don’t even think about how I can make sure I’m not thirsty ever. I just don’t think about it. If I didn’t have water in the house, I would go down to the corner store 7 Eleven. There they sell me water for money. Then throw it on someone.<n>2. You know where you would find oil? At an oil refinery. If they didn’t get oil anymore, they would be thirsty. I don’t know how you get thirsty without oil. I could do without oil actually. But I wouldn’t want to, because I think oil is really important for the health and wellbeing of the world.<n>3. I can’t think of anywhere that has only water that you might be looking in. The water fountain? When it got a lot of use in a school. You don’t see any pumps up there anymore. I don’t even know if you see a water fountain anymore. I don’ think they make them anymore. There was once a whole school full and then they took the pumps out. You can only pump once. So if you got somebody else thirsty, it’s like, you’re thirsty. You don’t get any water unless you fill up your bottle.<n>4. To be honest with you, you’re not gonna find anything. This is the end of the line. You’ve had it. They’re not making any more oil. You’re not gonna get any more oil. Oil is used for different things, not just for cars. Oil is used to make plastic and gas. If you’re not making it, where do you get it? You don’t use the stuff you have. Plumbers use it for different things. They use it to solder pipes together. There’s different kinds of oil. <n><n>A

If we think about the plumbing in the shower it caries hot water then that would not help us. The place to find plumbing in the house is in the bathrooms which is another choice.<n><n>The next question is about when a person is beginning work it is done with momentum. The answer choices are B,D,E,A. The reason why B,D,E are wrong is because the other words do not fit the question. Another reason why C is wrong is because it is not being done. The correct answer is A.<n><n>#### Explanation for output:<n>In the third question on the problem it says to look at the place where you would find pens with company logos, the answer choices are A,B,C, and D. What it is saying is that when you first start a pen there is a blank canvas and you can start any word that you want. The reason why B and C are wrong is because the choice options could also lead to B and C. The answer choice that is correct is A.<n><n>When it asks where was Sam it asks where was Sam the last time we said the name. In other words the last thing we said was Sam so we would look for another word or phrase that fit a situation. The answer choices are A,C,B,E,D. The reason why B is wrong is because B is not a name. The reason why D is wrong is because it does not fit with the question on the last line. The reason why C is wrong if it is not the same situation as the last time it was said. The answer choice that fits the question is A.<n>

The problem we face is that our answers are strings of multiple characters, and we need to be able to generate an XOR on each character of each word to perform the XOR gate. We need to be able to identify the number of letters used for each of the choices. Once we determine the number of characters we have per option, we need to construct the XOR gates using a shift register.<n><n>XOR-GATE WORKBOOK:<n><n>* To solve the XOR-Gate problem we will first make a shift register, called the XOR-gate.

We will be answering these using different logic techniques. <n><n>First, we will answer the second question that is, "When a person is beginning work..." using a logical technique called "A truth Table" which is defined as: "A method of using truth tables and sets to analyze statements in propositional logic." (Wikipedia). This will help us analyze our question and help us find the correct answer(s). <n><n>By using this logical function we'll be using the logic "A" to help determine our answer options.<n><n>The next logical function we will use is called "Fuzzy" which is defined as "used to describe the process by which an unfinished task is completed or something that occurs after a period of time. (Google)" <n>Thus, helping us answer our question about "achievements" by using the logical function "B" to help describe our answer options.<n>Fuzzy can be either right or wrong as stated earlier as long as it is a "right answer" for our logic to use it correctly. <n><n>Once we have used the logical functions and determined all the options, we will be "eliminating" all the answers that are wrong as seen in the following diagram:<n><img src="../img/

For example, determining the probability of someone being born in October. The goal is to test how\nyou understand probabilities and how to compute them from a given set of examples. (You cannot use a\nformula or program to do this problem.)\n\nThe assignment is to write Python programs that compute probabilities given sets of samples. Each problem\nmust be an independent instance that is, you may not use your solutions for any problem as a solution for another problem. The assignment is in two parts. In Part One, you will be asked to write\nan __import__ statement to import the random module and generate random numbers. Then you write\nthe __import__ statement for the random_sample module and generate a random sample of values using its\nrandom_sample() method. In part two, you compute the probability for each random_sample in the\npart one problem. Your probability assignments must also return the sample that you used in their\ncalculation.\n\n### Task 1: Importing Python and random_sample with two variables:\n\n-__import__ \u2018random\u2019 and give it a name\n\n-__import_module__ \u2018random_sample_module\u2019 and give it a variable", "answer": "C: baseball stadium"}

First, you need to put the expected output in the question as well. Second, the error message should contain the line that caused the problem, and the reason why it fails. And third, the line should be indented four spaces.\n\nComment: Oh ok I understand that.\n\nAnswer: You need to correct 3 errors on this:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\"E: better understanding\"\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nChange the first capital letter to lower-case letter 'E' and insert space between \"what\" and \"is\".\n\n\\begin{code}\n\"D: phone book\"\n\\end{code]\n\nChange the first and 6th capital letter to lower-cased.\n\n\\begin{quotewhere should I look?\"\n\\end{blockquote}[Change first 'A' to 'B' as that's the only answer that does not contain capital letter.]\n\nAlso, for some reason, you're using an indentation of more than 2 spaces that confuses Python's parser. The Python code you should be inserting in Python 3.8, should ideally use <kbd> 4 </kbd> tabs instead of 2 spaces.\n\nComment also, if you're using a Jupyter notebook to test your programs, check the **Help** menu for **Preferences -> Set Kernel Type -> Default**, which defaults to Python 2. Most of Jupyter's extensions like NLTK's are for Python 3, so you'll want to set defaults to 3.

{"text": "1.\"Which entrance would you choose if you do not want the back entrance?\" implicates that there are more than one entrance to the building and you want to choose between them.\n2. The use of the word \"entrance\" suggests a physical building.\n3. Based on the location, we can assume that the building is a public space where people would likely use entrances to gain access or enter it.\n4. Based on the question's context, we can assume that there is no reason for any individual to avoid a specific entrance over another.\n5. Options \"side\" and \"main\" imply the left and right side entrances, respectively.\n6. \"Anterior\" refers to the front of the building, which implies that it is the main entrance.\n7. \"Current\" means the path and direction of the present time.\n8.

This last statement in the question states that Jame was walking from somewhere to the spot where he burned his feet.\n4. We can also infer from this that although Jame suffered the burn, he was not immediately present when the burn happened. \n5. He therefore must have been on a journey from somewhere and later discovered that his feet were burned.\n6. The choice B: \u201csnow\u201d can be eliminated because that is not a surface and would not heat up when exposed to sunshine.\n7. The choice A: \u201cdisneyland\u201d is eliminated because it would not be hot out in the street and if there were any sunshine there, the surface would reflect rather than absorb the effect of the sun.\n8.

It could be hypothesized that the man rushed because of one or more of the five options given:\n\n\"Gain weight\" suggests that the person may rush because he wants to avoid gaining weight from eating too slowly.\nHowever, this does not seem to fit with the context of eating lunch and does not explain why the person would rush.\n\n\"Bad breath\" suggests that it is likely a possibility that the man was eating while his mouth was not properly brushed and hence his breath.\nHowever, this reasoning is too far-fetched and does not fit in context with the given scenario.\n\n\"Late for work\" implies that the man may be running late for work, which could explain why he is rushing.\nHowever, this is still only one possible explanation and does not directly specify the cause of the man's rush in eating his lunch.\n\"Heartburn\" may suggest that the food he is eating is causing him to have heartburn and as a result, he is rushing to finish his lunch.\n\nHowever, this explanation is again only one possibility and does not mention why the man is eating his lunch quickly in the first place.\n\n\"Early for work\" may indicate that the man is already early for work and as such, is rushing to eat his lunch to avoid being late for work.\n\nThis explanation is the only one that provides a logical explanation of why the man is rushing to finish eating his lunch and makes sense given the context of eating.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and potential explanations, the correct option is E: early for work.\nSo the final option is E: early fo work\n\nInput:How does a company make a profit?

But again, this does not prove that the glass is \"thin\".\n6. **\"E: Holding water\"** While many materials that are thin can hold water, this does not mean that every thin thing is a material that holds water.\n7.

{"text": "1: The question asks us what could prevent someone from buing christmas presents.\n2. The keyword here is 'buying' but, there is no need of 'buying' as it is already given that this is a christmas season where all the gifts should be available.\n3. So we are looking only in the options to find any option which could have prevented someone from buying christmas presents.\n4. From the options we see Happiness is an emotion and not a thing. So, it would not prevent anyone from buying gifts, so eliminate it.\n5. Lack of money would also not prevent anyone from buing gifts as there are plenty of options available to make payments. So, it would also be eliminated.\n6. Stress would not be there on christmas and hence also should be eliminated.\n7.

However focusing on the given options can help to identify the most fitting choice.\n4. D: \"getting somewhere\" doesn't seem to have much relation to underwater traveling where visibility may be a problem. \n5. Similarly, A: \"disorientation\" doesn't refer to places as 'places' could imply a land form or a location or destination rather than movement or being in one place.\n6. Options C and B both could potentially refer to 'places'. \n7. Option B: \"due to\" could possibly refer to 'places' as \"due to\" can also mean \"caused by\". \n8. However, the term 'dangers' may suggest that the traveler doesn't know exactly where they are, even if it's a known location.\n9. Thus, B: \"due to\", doesn't refer to 'places', leaving option A: \"disorientation\".\n10. Option D:'relocation' may be referring to traveling undersea and having to find a new area to'relocate' or move to.\n11. However, it seems like the \"underwater travel\" itself is the cause of disorientation.\n12. The best answer to this question is A: 'disorientation'.\n13.

We can see that they are not all items in that room, so this is not an exhaustive list.\n3. Looking for the answer choices, we can see that the options provided are both nouns and verbs.\n4. Among the vocabulary-based options, we can eliminate options B, C, and E because they indicate indefinite articles, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question.\n5. We can also eliminate options A and B because the options A, which is a noun, and B, which is a verb are not options that can work in this context, and would indicate the absence of the object of the question, rather than the answer to the question.\n6. Option C is likely to be the answer since it is a noun that can work in this question.\nSo the final output for what are all the three things in the room is C: lamp", "answer": "B: city"}

Here we can interpret \u201cunending\u201d to mean \u201clifelong\u201d.\n5.) Thus, someone who lacks immortality will be someone who will have a mortal life span.\n6.)

Happy can be easily detected on someone\u2019s face because their body language or attitude reflects through it.\n6. Sadness and anxiety are not directly represented to this extent, but the question mentions that other people can\u2019t identify these feelings.\n7.

Based on this analysis, each of the given options can be seen to have one or more of the above features.\n4. Option I can be considered as a statement that is consistent with a well written essay question, as it includes a preposition. However, it does not give any indication around a conclusion or parallel structure.\n5. Option III can be considered as another statement that is consistent with well written essay question. It includes a tense (present-tense) and a thesis statement. However, there is no indication around a preposition or conclusion.\n6. Option II is another option that can be considered as consistent with a well written question, as it includes parallel structure (but not preposition) in addition to a conclusion section.\n7. Option IV, however, appears as a statement that lacks any features of a well written question.\nSo, comparing the different options by evaluating their inclusion (or lack of them) of the above five features indicates that the options II and III are the correct answers.\nSo the final answers are: II and\n\n### Bonus Instruction: For the following multiple choice question, find the correct number for the expression \u201c8 \u00d7 22 \u2013 5 + 10 = 147\u201d.

John was also a student of sorts and therefore, he would have been keen to know the origins of what he saw.\n4. As a result, he was a very learned person.\n5. As per the options given, A and C would seem appropriate choices because John would have to use his legs to do both actions.\n6. On the other hand, the other 3 options seem out of place because they do not require any use of legs. \n7. For example, B talks about tired feet and E is about John's thought process after he had seen the exhibits.\n8. On the other hand B is about feet and therefore seems like a good choice for him to perform it himself.\n9. Option B talks about gaining knowledge, therefore we can infer John is someone who likes to learn more by going to museums.\n10. Similarly, E also talks about him pondering after seeing the exhibits so that seems likely for him to perform the function.\n11. Thus, based on the inference we can see that A and E are the most suitable options because they were the options that talked about his body movements.\n12. Therefore, the options that are not out of place are A: tired feet and E: pondering.\nSo the final answers are A - E: being tired; pondering; gaining knowledge\n\nInput:You're walking up the stairs and there's a cat that's waiting for a treat.

However, we can observe that only the options: 'lie down' and 'go to sleep' are both suitable for such behavior.\n5. However, 'going to sleep' is more descriptive and makes the most sense given that the animal is likely overtired and needs rest to survive.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: 'go to sleep'.\nSo the final answer would be D: go to sleep \n\nInput:I hope you'll consider joining the team. What do you do if you decide to join the team?

Get up and dress myself.' makes sense, it's less commonly used. \n11) The sentence 'How to prepare for work? Get up and get dressed' is more commonly used and makes sense. \n12) The latter option would also involve the man getting ready with other things such as'shower' and'show up' or commuting to work. \n13) Therefore, the most likely answer to 'What would an adult man in the morning do to get ready for the work?' is Dress (option D).\n \nSo the final answer will be D: dress", "answer": "C: dress himself"}

Since we don't have any specification regarding the destination of cow, we can speculate that the cow is going to put to work somewhere in the place of the cow's breed.\n4. The given options are related to different geographical locations.\n5.

{"text": "1. The question asks about the likely place where a paper notice could be left on a house.\n2. The question doesn't explicitly mention that the house is uninhabited or if the occupants of the house would know about the notice.\n3. This suggests the paper notice would likely be left on a place that can be seen or reached by the notice-giver.\n4. To this effect, we can discard the possibility of leaving the paper notice behind as a part of conference activity or a classroom activity.\n5. Another way of interpreting the \"classroom\" option was that the house would contain a classroom and the notice could be left for the class.\n6. This doesn\u2019t make sense when considering the question asks about a paper notice left on a house, which might be occupied by an individual or a family and thus unlikely to contain a classroom.\n7. The \"conference\" could be associated with a conference involving only an individual or a few participants.\n8. However, assuming the house is also hosting a conference, it is still unlikely to contain a notice as it could be missed or missed by mistake when looking for.\n9.

The first step in solving this question is to understand the context of the question.\n2.1 It is common for people to place the blades and prongs of forks away from them on a dinner table to avoid potential choking hazards, due to the sharpness of the blade and the small size of the prongs.\n3. The most sensible choice would be the prongs, as they are the sharp and small items that are farthest away from the user's mouth, reducing the risk of any accidents.\n4. The next choice is the fork handles, however, they are typically made of a softer material that is easier to damage, especially when being removed from the water during washing.\n5.

Finally, if the show was a 'variety show', then it would have been a 'anthology'.\n10.) As a result, we see that either of these shows are 'anthologies', which is the correct answer to the question.\nSo the final  answer is A: anthology\n\nInput: Many people have to wait a long time in line to get their tickets for \"Hamilton.\"  It's the world's most popular what?

Choices:  Switzerland A: Spain B: Sweden C: Germany D: Italy E: Russia\nOutput: 1 After researching the question we were able to deduce that women were not allowed to vote in Spain or Italy until 1975 which was more recent.  Therefore we decided that it must not have been allowed for women in Switzerland.\n2. This is because Switzerland became a republic in 1848 and then a federal parliamentary republic in 1874.\n3. At that point, both Switzerland and Italy had just become republics, which was the main reason for Switzerland\u2019s incorrect answer.\nSo the correct answer is I: Switzerland", "answer": "C: candle"}

This is a term that refers to sexual intimacy between two romantic partners.\n5. Thus, given the context of the question, we can eliminate options B, C and E.\n6.

{"text": "1. The question asks about the likely place to view a copy machine.\n2. The question does not specifically state if it\u2019s an old or new copy machine.\n3. But in common parlance, an old copy machine would indicate that it\u2019s old, which is why we can assume that it is.\n4. Based on this assumption, the only suitable answers for the question would be those where one would likely view old machines or equipment, such as a museum or a barn. \n5. The other options mentioned such as industrial area, school, and office, could be used for a copy machine, but are not likely places for viewing such items.\n6. Therefore to choose a suitable option, we need to think deeply about the context of using a copy machine and the possibilities of it being stored in a school, business, or industrial area.\n7. This would lead us to eliminate school as a possibility since we don't typically bring old machines from a school environment to look at or view, and industrial options as well since they are not likely to have old machines lying around on display or stored.\n8. We also have to think of where such machines are typically stored, which could be any of the remaining options of museums, barns, office spaces, or even retail spaces like a store or warehouse.\n9. However, due to the usage of the word  \"likely\" in the question, we can rule out options that have a weak or minimal relation to the type of item being described or the nature of the situation, such as office spaces.\n10. And as mentioned previously, museums would be a suitable option as they are usually places that exhibit old items or machines.\n11. So we can narrow it down to either museums or barns, as they both have a strong relation to viewing old equipment.\n12. Finally, from the list of options, the only remaining one which makes sense to us is a barn as it indicates that the copy machine could be old or of an older design.\nSo the final answers is option C: barn.\n\nInput: There was much speculation as to what his next book would be about.

Therefore, to drive near some obstacle which is higher and steeper, we can avoid driving a vehicle through a mountain pass.\n4) This narrows down options to only B & D.\n5) \"To school\" can be interpreted as a situation where the obstacle may be avoided, but in this case, the context is clear as people avoid driving when kids are out to schools.\n6) It can be concluded that for the relevant context, the only remaining option is B: a mountain pass.\n7) So the final answer is B: a mountain.\nSo the final choice is B: a mountain\n\nInput: The city was full of noise and music, and even if they didn\u2019t want to listen to it, the din could not be blocked out by choosing what?

{"text": "1.. The question asks where performers would be found on a platform in public.\n2. To find performers, we should look for a platform in public. This implies that we should look for a place where the public is gathered, and can see performers easily.\n3. While it mentions \u201cpublic\u201d here, many of those phrases have a different connotation that does not quite fit with.\n4. Public generally refers to large venues like arenas, sports centres etc, and \"docks\u201d would not really be the right choice since docks (boats, water etc.) are often far away or concealed to the public.\n5. We can, however, rule out buildings which would not require performers to be on a platform in the first place.\n6. Similarly \u2018museum\u2019 is out of bounds since performances generally don\u2019t take place in museums.\n7. This narrows our options down to \u201carena\u201d and \u201cconcert hall\u201d, but we need to make sure it makes the most sense contextually.\n8. From the options given, arena seems more likely to describe a location where the public will be able to see a performance since an arena is generally more open or spacious and thus the platform should be visible to the crowd.\n9.

A balloon is mostly tied to someone rather than is standing by itself and is a part of celebration.\n9.

For example, B: \"kentucky derby\" is a specific annual race for thoroughbred horses in the United States.\n4. A horse can't usually compete in a specific race, so the artist would have to commemorate a horse's involvement in the derby by either participating in or spectating the event.\n5. Similarly, D: \"painting\" refers to an intangible depiction of a horse in an artistic sense, similar to A: \"hoof\" (which is a physical part of the horse), and C & E \"race track\" and \"triple crown\" (which are both places where horses compete).\n6.

Choices: \t\t A: at breakfast B: after a night of drinking C: during the morning commute D: after watching sports E: when they hear the last note of a concert\nOutput: 1: The question states that people are singing (the national anthem) most in their country or when they hear the last song of a concert, indicating that the singing is happening after a concert.\n2.'The most people in your country' denotes majority.\n3. 'Singing the national anthem' gives clues as to the time at which it is happening. Therefore, it can be inferred that the singing of the national anthem is happening at night when most people sing after a night of drinks.\n4. Also, it can be concluded that the singer is a citizen of the country because it is not unusual for a person to hear the singing of his national anthem.\n5. However, if the singer is hearing the singing at a night out, it is most likely to be someone he knows who had partied with him earlier.\n6.

The question mentions \"what he needed\" that he hadn't gotten in a long time - that must refer to something more than rest or better food.\n3. The given options include 'addiction', 'fatigue','relaxation', 'headaches' and 'over-eating'; 'fatigue' indicates an absence of rest, 'overeating' implies excessive intake of food, 'addiction' suggests a behavioral condition, and'relaxation' means one can be satisfied with a state of ease.\n4.

{"text": "1.. The question is about the place where the cracked and dry heels are found.\n2. In order to answer the question, we must consider what cracked and dry heel means and the context in which they were mentioned.\n3. The context refers to an earlier statement that \"she had cracked and dry heeled all summer\" and that she was \"given her special attention\" while eating breakfast.\n4. This suggests that the person who was given special attention has cracked and dry healed, and it is likely that they have done so due to summer activities, like spending more time outdoors or wearing shoes. 5. \"Boots\" is not an appropriate answer because they do not necessarily crack or dry-heel. They can, however, be seen in a desert, which is not a significant consideration in the original context. \"Hock\" cannot be correct because it is a meat preparation. \"Loaf of bread\" is not suitable because loafs of bread can be dried out by baking or toasting, or left to dry in an airy place, but no specific contextual information hints toward this type of conditioning. \"Foot\" is perhaps the most appropriate answer, as it can become cracked and dry-healed from prolonged exposure to the elements, and it is likely to be found on the ground, where special attention may have been given. \"Bread\" is a possible answer, as it may crack and dry-heal from exposure and neglect.\n\nInput: They say every cloud has a silver lining.

Therefore, the next step is to analyze the options to identify the best way to properly return the index card.\n7.

It means fish should spend more time in some kind of body of water than not. \n3. Option A is a place fish spend most of their time and has some correct options such as lake, river, or sea.\n4. However, a large body of water such as the ocean, sea, and lake may not have fish everywhere and some areas may not have any fish at all even though most fish are in the ocean. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer.\n5. Option B is lake superior. Lake superior is quite cold due to its location and in such temperatures fish cannot survive. In fact, there are no fish at all in lake superior.\n6. Option C is underwater. However, fish spend their life time in sea and lake where there is a lot of water. Some of the fish do live underwater, but this is not the majority of fish.\n7. Option D has two correct answers to the question, which is toilet and aquarium. Some species of fish might spend majority of their life in a pot at home as pets whereas in the wild fish spend majority of their life underwater so option D is correct.\n8. Option E is aquarium but this is only correct in a small way because the answer must be something most fish live in but the aquarium is still the majority of fish life. \n9.

{"text": "1: The first step of any troubleshooting is to make sure the problem is not related to something outside the equipment itself.\n2. Therefore, the question is asking us to consider the connections or channels outside the equipment-company, telephone network, airport, wires and freeway.\n3. It is evident that the system won't power up, so it is unlikely that it is a fault in the outside connections.\n4. But, we need to consider whether there are any other connections between the equipment and the outside systems- company, telephone network, etc.\n5. Since the equipment won't power up we may consider the connection faulty but to find out what the problem is with the connection it is necessary to check each of the outside connections, which include company, telephone network and airport.\n6. This eliminates the option 'A: company' as it is clear that the system is powered off so it means there will be no connection to the company.\n7. Thus, this rules out option 'A: company'.\n8. Next, we may ask whether there were any power failures recently or whether the equipment could be unplugged/connected to a different power source because we know that the equipment won't connect to its power source.\n9. This leads us to the conclusion that the equipment could be unpowered at the moment as it can't power the equipment via the power sources it is connected to, which means that power supply is either interrupted or faulty.\n10. The fact that the system won' t work on its power sources also excludes option 'B: telephone network', as we know the system won't work on its power sources.\n11. Next, we may also consider the possibility of the company network being faulty, if not powerless.\n12. If so, airports and wires cannot be ruled out either.\n13. This eliminates options 'C: airport' and 'D: wire', as well as 'E: freeway' since they are outside the equipment connections.\n14. Therefore the option that fits best to answer the question is 'B: telephone Network'.\nSo the final answer that suits the context is B: telephone network\n\nInput:The taller man is what?

From the options provided in the question there are only two types of roads: England (road in the UK) and New Jersey.\n6. Although Scotland, Europe, and race track could be called roads, they are not the specific kind of roads referred to by motorway in the question.\n7.

However, option H is not applicable, as it only provides a method for correcting one's mistakes.\n4. In addition, several options, F, G, E, and D, specifically refer to reading, which is inappropriate for learning a language, as it does not involve the use of one\u2019s voice to mimic the language and practice pronunciation and speech.\n5.

Now, let's examine each option individually.\n5. \"university\" refers to a higher education institution that typically includes a college, so it could be understood as synonymous with \"college.\"\n6. Similarly, \"college\" also refers to a higher education institute.\n7. Additionally, \"college\" is shorter than \"university\" and has slightly different connotations, which gives it a slightly different meaning.\n8. However, these meanings are interchangeable and both refer to \"a university or college.\"\n9. The same goes for \"classroom,\" \"class room,\" and \"classroom.\"\n10. While \"classroom\" indicates an entire classroom, \"class room\" indicates an open space in the classroom designated for specific classes, and \"classroom\" indicates a single classroom, they are all variations of a single meaning.\n11. Therefore, the answer is either \"university or college,\" which encompasses all the options given.  Since we're looking for the location of the highest possibility of James's location, we can eliminate the options with locations we know James is not at, such as \"university\" or university classes (those will be \"university classes\" rather than \"university\"), \"classroom,\" and \"classroom\" due to these being synonyms.\n12. Therefore, the answer would be either \"college classes\" or \"university classes.\"\n13. Although \"university classes\" has a slightly different meaning, it is a synonym that is closer to \"university\" than \"college classes\" is to \"university.\"\n14. Additionally, \"colleges\" encompasses \"college classes\" (as seen in the answer \"college classes\").\n15. Therefore, taking this into consideration, and eliminating all the options that are the opposite of what James is doing, the answer is \"college classes.\"\n16. The final answer is A: college classes.", "answer": "E: library"}
{"text": "1: The question mentions James travelling to a steakhouse outside South.\n2. We can infer that James travelled from the South and went to this steak house.\n3. The steakhouse is not locally available and is unique to a certain region.\n4. Some locations or regions are better known for its unique cuisine.\n5. The question highlights this by mentioning that the steak house is the best outside the South.\n6. Also, by travelling outside the locality, he likely crossed a state border or boundary.\n7. A building can house people of different location or town, but steak house is more a cultural or local restaurant.\n8. Therefore choosing between options C and D is the right choice.\n9. However, option C: Texas, is a very large state within the South.\n10. Florida on the other hand, is not part of the South, but a part of the southeastern region (Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, and Texas) as mentioned in the question.\n11. Finally, we can conclude that the best steakhouse is in Florida.\nSo the final choice should be C: Florida.", "answer": "D: michigan"}
{"text": "1.) The question states that utensils are used during an \"evening activity\".\n2.) The question also provides 6 options, namely \"backpack\",\"closet\", \"drawer\", \"dinner\", \"cupboard\" and \"dishwasher\".\n3.) Utensils can be used for all of these activities, but the question specifies that only the evening activity be considered as the context.\n4.) So to narrow down the number of options we need to eliminate all of the options except the evening activity.\n5.) The only out of the 6 options left, i.e., that is exclusive to evenings is \"dinner\".\n6.) \"Dinner\" can also be further narrowed down using various other narrowing techniques, but the above reasoning suffices.\n7.) So the correct answer should be \"dinner\".\nSo the final answer\nis D: dinner\n\nInput: How much time has it been since she last bought meat? Choices: 1. A: an hour B: fifteen minutes C: over an hour D: thirty minutes E: two hours\nOutput: 1st of all, the first statement gives us a clue how to decide the answer. Here, when they said 'last bought meat' they mean bought meat in the last hour at least.\n2. This statement has the effect of narrowing our options, restricting the choice to either \"over an hour\" or \"two hours\".\n3. This means that either \"over an hour or \"twenty four minutes\" since she last bought meat.\n4. Since the question doesn't say \"how many hours\", the answer has to be either \"over an hour\", \"two hours\" or \"one hour and thirty minutes\".\n5. We can eliminate any options that aren't either \"over an hour/two hours\" or \"three hundred minutes\" except one.\n6. Since there is only one other option remaining i.e., \"two hours\", this is most probably the correct answer.\nSo the correct answer is C: over an hour\n\nInput: What is a way to spend a warm March day?

The most likely options for \"human powered\" water transportation are \"row boats\" and \"paddles\" since they require a physical effort from the individual rowing.\n4. \"turn away\" and \"run\" are not water transportation options; they refer to the actions necessary to avoid being struck by a turn of the tide.\n5. \"sleep and have to sleep\" are not transportation options; they are ways to relax on your time when on a boat.\n6.

{"text": "1 This question is asking for an answer among the given options that describes a fast but expensive way of transporting cargo that may not be as reliable as its alternatives.\n2. One of the given options is to \"send cargo via ship\u2019s hold.\u201d\n3. \"Sending cargo via ship\u2019s holds\" is more expensive than some other modes of transport, but is relatively fast.\n4. This method would probably be uncommon for someone considering transporting large or bulky cargo.\n5. Another given option is to \"send cargo by train\".\n6. Trains are slower than ships, but are generally considered reliable, safe, and cost-effective.\n7. Another option is to send cargo by truck.\n8. Trucks provide faster services at the expense of higher costs and may require more time and planning than other methods of transporting cargo.\n9. Another option would be to transport cargo by airplane.\n10. One of the drawbacks of transporting cargo by airplane is its high cost, and its efficiency is often questionable due to adverse weather and other factors.\n11. Lastly, one of the options stated \"send cargo via boat hold\".\n12. Cargo carried by a boat would typically use the hold compartment, which is known to be large and safe.\n13. However, the cost of this cargo would likely be higher than that of others and may take longer to reach the destination due to the distance involved.\n14. From the context, it's unlikely that \"cargo\" refers to small or minor cargo, so the options of truck or ship's hold do not seem to be very viable.\n15. Based on the context, it is safe to assume that \"small\" refers to lightweight cargo, such as packages or small packages delivered via shipping service. \n16. Therefore, options of \u201ctruck\u201d or \u201cship\u2019s hold\u201d, which both involve bulky, heavy cargo, can be eliminated from the answer. \n17. Based on the context and available information, the correct answer here is \"send cargo via airplane\".\nSo the final answer to this multiple choice question is D: airplane\n\nInput: How can you identify a cow that is likely to become a sirloin steak?

C: hotter than the sun 4. D: as long as it's supposed to 5. E: too quickly \nOutput:This question is about the length of a product's lifespan.\n1. The question asks how long ice water can last in the sun.\n2. The sun refers to the ultraviolet radiation, not the planet.\n3. Therefore, ice water will last as long as it' is expected to.\n4. The length of the water's lifespan depends on the strength of the sun and the ice used.\n5. However, in terms of the sun's strength, the ice water will last 'too long' by the question.\n6. Looking for the option that describes too long, the answer is 4, 'as long as expected'.\n7. While the question asks how long the ice water will last relative to how long it is expected to last, 'too long' is described as how the item lasts relative to its actual lifespan.\n8. Therefore, looking for an equivalent choice, option 'too long' can be given as 'as long as expected' in order to complete the question.\n9. So the final answer is 4, as long as expected.\n\nInput: Is my dog a boy or 11? Choices:  a boy (not a breed)\nOutput:The question asks whether the speaker's dog is an animal or a number.\n1.

Choices:  A. Ship less-frequently B. Order more goods C. Only order from local suppliers D. Ship goods with one day priority E. Make more frequent deliveries\nOutput: 1 Answer: D: Ship more frequently 2. The question asks how a local business owner can save money on shipping.\n3. One easy and cost-effective way to do so is by picking the shipping option D: Ship more Frequently.\n4. Though C, ordering goods from local suppliers could also prove to be an effective way, the primary aim is to reduce cost. This can be addressed to a large extent by selecting option D: Shipping more Frequently. While option E: Make more frequent deliveries, could be an expensive and time consuming option. This makes the other options C and D more desirable.\n5. By process of elimination, the best-suited answer is D: Ship Frequently.\n6. But in order to prove more effective, we need to rule out another option B: Shipping less frequently.\n7. Though less frequent shipping sounds like an effective way to cut down on shipping costs, it won't always be financially viable and practical.\n8. With less frequent shipping, the cost for setting up and unsetting warehouses and staff won't be reduced or covered by increased shipments.\n9. So, while option B sounds reasonable in theory, it is not effective in practice.\n10. Since option D provides a more comprehensive solution to the problem, as it covers the costs, time, and logistics concerns, Option D: Shipping Frequently is the best answer.\nSo the answer is D: shipping frequently\n\nInput: A large number of the population in a certain Latin American country live in poverty.

Hence, in common usage, the part of the earth covered under the ocean would be considered the 'beach', which falls under none of the mentioned choices.\n6. This leaves us with the only possibility of the surface of the earth to be covered by the ocean.", "answer": "D: surface of earth"}

{"text": "1\" A laundry room is typically a place where people can do their own laundry.\n2. But, there could be a laundry room in a place only used by staff, such as a hotel, greenhouse, or dormitory.\n3. From the options given: hotel, greenhouse, and dormitory are all places where staff would likely be staying.\n4. However, most staff at resorts and hotels would instead visit the laundry room to leave their linens or do laundry onsite, so the laundry room is likely to be in their dormitory.\n5. But, hotels are likely to have staff living onsite who would need to perform minor laundry tasks, so they would find the laundry room in their dormitory as well.\n6. A greenhouse would need to have staff who were doing their own laundry, such as farmers and gardeners, so they are likely to have a laundry room at their workplace.\n7. College students are likely to do their own laundries at their dormitories, so they are  most likely to find the laundry  room at their dormitory. \n8. But, if they do not have a laundry  room in their dormitories, they would have to walk to a laundromat, a public area where people can do laundry.\n9.

{"text": "1- The question asks what a judge does when someone is convicted for a crime.\n2. We know 'convicted' implies that the accused person is guilty as found by the court and has been given a sentence by the court.\n3. We understand that the final step of this process is to pass the sentence by the judge on the accused person.\n4. Therefore, the option 'pass sentence' seems most relevant in relation to the question.\n5. However, the options 'conduct trial', 'arrest', and 'bring in verdict' have either been taken from the earlier steps or stages preceding this step.\n6. These steps include evidence collection for the trial, arresting the accused, and examination of evidence respectively by the prosecution.\n7. The option'serve justice' is again irrelevant because it refers to the consequence imposed on the criminal, rather than the process of judgement.\n8. Thus from the options given, the most suitable response would be B: pass sentence.\nSo the final correct answer is B: pass sentence\n\nInput: I've never seen anybody run faster than him, as I could tell by comparing him to others; but I have seen people run really fast.

C: I have never seen someone run faster than him as I could notice him speeding to the point when I was comparing him to the other people in his company.\n4. D: To make this point clearer, the question is comparing someone's speed to that of others, which is why E isn't appropriate.\n5.

The answer would likely reflect resting, since this is the most obvious and intuitive word that could be related to'something'.\n5. Also, this suggests taking a break, being tired may reflect a decision made by a person to get some rest.\n6. From the given options, B: make mistakes, is the most intuitive since'resting' and'making mistakes' are directly antithetical, meaning'resting' could cause'making mistakes' and vice versa, depending on the situation.\n7. A: sit down would be another option, but since the question talks about doing something,'sit down' does not convey the same meaning.\n8. Further,'sit down','relaxing', and 'exiting' are similar and might be confused, it would make more sense to use 'exiting' instead of 'changing location'.\n9. C: have sex would also be another choice, however, being exhausted from a long walk can lead to making mistakes, which might include some sexual mistakes.\n10. D: reproduce refers mostly to things like bacteria, which could make sense when they're tired of their physical world and wish to reproduce.\n11.

{"text": "1.'Walk barefooted' means walking without shoes.\n2. So the question, while speaking about a general rule, is actually asking what we shouldn't do, i.e. walk barefooted after rain.\n3. This seems counter-intuitive as walking barefooted is a common and easy way to clean one\u2019s feet during wet weather.\n4. Walking barefooted after rain, however, would result in getting wet feet/shoes, as the previous footsteps would be soaked in water.\n5. This would be uncomfortable as wet feet/shoed are prone to fungal infections and are very painful.\n6. So the answer to the question would be D - 'Wet ground'.\n7. Though this seems an unrelated option that doesn't directly address the nature or purpose of walking barefooted after rain to clean one's feet.\n8. 'Wet ground' is the obvious choice because it speaks about wetness in terms of ground, not in terms of water.\n9. So wet ground should generally be avoided as it becomes difficult to walk.\n10. Dry ground, i.e. not wet, can be walked on without shoes and can also be easily cleaned.\n11.

The given options in the question can be divided into two parts\na) Exercising -gym and refrigerator\nb) Drinking- juice bar and fridge\n7. The given options'square' and 'limejuice' are irrelevant to the question.\n8. The given pair'square' and 'lemon juice' can be understood as a location of business, thus making the answer irrelevant to the question. 'Juicebar' can be understood as places of business, not the juice that is served at such places.\n9.

The jungle of the given question could possibly be the Amazon jungle. However, the Amazon jungle is generally located in Colombia or Brazil but not in China.\nSimilarly, there is no reference of Australia being located in the Amazon of Colombia or Brazil in the question.\n(ii) \"Bamboo Grove\": Although bamboo is also found in Australia, as stated in the question, this is not the proper habitat for a koala. \nThus, it can be eliminated.\n(iii) \"Australian Outback\" : Similar to point 2(ii), as stated in the answer, in addition to the fact that the question does not indicate how the outback is different from the panda habitat. We can also ignore this as it is not the actual location of the panda. (iv) \"China\" : The koala is native to the continent of Australia which is another good reason why China can be eliminated. (V) \"Children's Book\" : The question only indicates that a stuffed koala is present in an odd area, it makes no mention of how the koala might be oddly present in a children's book.\n4.

From the context of the question, we can deduce that the gift is intended for the person to feel special or appreciative of the thoughtfulness.\n4.

Looking at the question we can see that the person is asking how to increase his earnings.\n3.

Thus, no matter what, there will always be an associated income whether the job is \u2018owned\u2019 or not.\n5. Thus A: \u2018better job\u2019 and B: \u2018own house\u2019 can be ruled out.\n6.

In other words, his preferences were always based on his impressions of the room.\n3) Since the question doesn\u2019t specify if the person is talking about their own house, or about someone else\u2019s house it is reasonable to assume that it could be about either.\n4) For a house to have multiple rooms, then the room that was mentioned must be important enough to be considered among the most important rooms.\n5) Among all the given options, the only one that fits the description would be the \u2018kitchen\u2019\n6) There is no reason to eliminate either option A or B, and therefore it is fair to assume that either of those would fit the description.\n7) However, while the \u2018basement\u2019 or \u2018yard\u2019 may be important rooms and have a specific sense of importance assigned to them, there is no room in the list that is so important that it should be considered the \u2018favorite room\u2019.\n8) Considering option C: the \u2018kitchen\u2019 is commonly regarded as one of the most important and central rooms in a house, as it is where food is prepared and cooked.\n9) This would mean that in terms of importance and significance it would be fair to assume that a person would always feel drawn to it.\n10) If we assume that the other two options that may have a sense of importance or significance, the \u2018basement\u2019 and the \u2018yard\u2019 are not considered the favorite room, then \u2018kitchen\u2019 would be the only remaining option that fits the description given in the question.\n11) After these steps, it would be safe to say that the kitchen would be the favorite room of this house.\nSo the final  answer is C: kitchen\n\nInput: The cemetery was the resting place of our ancestors, and now their what?

Among all grocery items, baked foods are a specific form of cuisines or food items that are created with some heating procedure and are categorized as fast food items.\n4. Pizzerias are a common food chain that sells pizzas and other baked foods in multiple flavors, varieties, shapes, sizes, and toppings.\n5. Pizzerias have a special attraction among people worldwide because of the varied and tempting pizza options and are majorly found in cities.\n6. Therefore, considering the given options the answer to the question should be D: \"food court.\"\n7.

{"text": "1,2,8. The question talks about how we can share files with someone.\n3. We require an internet connection in this case because files are typically shared through the wonders of the interwebs, which requires internet connectivity for accessing and sharing data from anywhere.\n4. Therefore, from the above context, we know that sharing files requires an internet connection.\n5. Additionally, options A, B, and C all refer to media through which an internet connection can be shared.\n6. However, as we need an internet connection for sharing files, one would not need a radio, a freeway or an electrical circuit for this purpose.\n7. So, from the above context and the process of elimination, E: computer network  is the most appropriate option.\nSo the final option is E: computer network\n\nInput: \"Sir, I really appreciate you,\" he said honestly. \"You made me think, I had a _____ idea I need to try.\" Choices:  A:\"great\" B:\"unique\" C:\"good\" D:\"amazing\" E:\"horrible\"\nOutput: 1.\"The given question talks about how \u2018he said honestly\u2019 that he \u2018really appreciate (s)ir\u2019.\n2. Therefore, \u2018sir\u2019 is one of the subjects of the sentence as a recipient, who appreciated him.\n3. The \u2018I had a _____ idea\u2019 is indicative of the fact that \u2018I\u2019, the same subject, \u2018had _____\u2019; the answer cannot be a word/sentence that does not contain the subject \u2018I\u2019.\n4.

{"text": "1) The question asks where a fox was thirstily searching for water during the dry season.\n2) By process of elimination, the options not giving a specific place were 'painting', 'hen house', 'California', and'movie hall'.\n3) As the question only talks about finding water during the drought and no indication of the fox being thirsty for anything else was given, we understand that the fox was definitely thirsty for water, and not art, chickens & eggs, or movies only.\n4) Option 'California' did not fit in simply because the fox seemed to be quite desperate in his search for water - if California was the only option, why wouldn't the fox choose that instead of thirstily searching his whole habitat?\n5) Option'movie hall' is an ambiguous name for just any movie theater, and would not have applied in the case of a dry season - we could understand if a fox went to a movie hall to find water (because movie halls often contain water fountains for convenience), but in our case, the fox is clearly searching for water.\n6) Option 'hen house' can be inferred to be a place that could have water as long as the fox could get past the chickens - but, the question only talked about how the fox was thirstically searching for water, and chickens can obviously kill a fox on sight.\n7) The only places left were options 'virginia' and 'painting', and option 'painting' is not a legitimate place to find water, as it is used to describe an artwork made with wet paint.\n8) As the fox is obviously thirsting for water, the only remaining answer left is option 'virginia', that implies a place (or river) in Virginia, USA named 'Virginia'.\nSo the final answer was E: Virginia is the correct answer.\n\nInput: What do you call the person who runs the game at a golf tournament?

Option B, pantry, however, may not be the best place when the jar needs to be kept outside.\n6. Therefore, by eliminating Option B, Pantry, we are left with Option E, refrigerator.\n7. However, since the refrigerator isn't provided in the question, we need to compare other details.\n8. As per the given scenario, the jar is likely to spoil when left out so keeping it in the fridge doesn't make sense.\n9. Hence, Option E, refridgerator, is ruled out as the correct answer.\n10. Option C, grocery store, is also ruled out since it suggests leaving it in a location where it can get dirty and spoil.\n11.

{"text": "1. The question is asking us where we can find air that has been recently breathed by a few people.\n2. The options provided are:  train station, house, cupboard, cricket stadium and surface of the earth.\n3. None of these options seem consistent with the description of air breath by a few people recently.\n4. Looking carefully at the options provided, it's likely that the breathing of only a few people is within small rooms or houses, like a class room, study area or at home.\n5. Moreover, it's likely they have breathed in similar rooms or in close proximity to each other, like at home or at school or in office, as this increases the chances of the air being consistent across them.\n6. In such cases, the breath of only a few people does not spread far into many rooms or across wide spaces, but is confined to small rooms or buildings, thereby suggesting that the air most likely is in small spaces and breath by only a few people.\n7. Of the options provided, E: surface of the earth is excluded from the list since the air on the earth moves around constantly, and thus, there will be various people from all over the world who breathe at different moments and hence cannot be called having breathed the air recently.\n8. The remaining 5 options are: A: train station, B: house, C: cupboard, D: cricket stadiums.\n9. Considering the context, the option D: cricket stadia would be the most suitable as it involves large spaces with only a few people. The chances of the air breath being consistent within the stadium are high and the air is likely to have been breathed by only people from nearby stands of a cricket stadium, as mentioned in the original option.\n10. The other 4 options, like A: train station, house or D cupboard: are places that would often be crowded with various people. Also, a stadium does not have people from a limited geographical location breathe or the air breathed by only a certain group of people, unlike a few people.\n11. Hence, it's not likely that the air could be breathed by only a particular group of people like it is in a cupboard or a classroom, and hence D: cricket stadias seems suited to the context.\n12", "answer": "B: house"}

{"text": "1 The question asks which appliance uses water and soaps?\n2 The washing machine and blender are both appliances which are known to use water, however, the question also mentions soaps, in which case, the surface of earth would be a better choice, as earth is the main source of soaps.\n3 A space shuttle has been known to use water and soaps, however, it does not necessarily use either as a regular appliance, therefore, this answer is ruled out.\n4 A Disney theme park, although being similar to a traditional amusement park and using some rides which require water and soaps, does not primarily use water and the soaps, therefore, its options cannot be a better answer.\n5 Washing machines can use water and soaps by using detergents as chemical agents.\n6 This indicates that if detergents are removed from the machine (for example, if the wash is stopped from running) then the washing machine can no longer clean clothes or dishes effectively without detergents (which is what it typically uses to get rid of stains).\n7 Space shuttles and Disney theme parks cannot rely on soap and water (without using additional products such as detergents, lotions, soaps etc).\n8 The surface of earth provides for the natural presence of soaps.\n9 However, soap in itself cannot be a sole source for water and cleaning purposes.\nSo the final and correct answer is E: surface of the earth", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

Sadness is unlikely to be the dominant feeling.\n6. Amusement probably wouldn't be the dominant feeling because the questions ask about the dominant feeling.\n7. Also, losing money and anger are more extreme feelings compared to happy, so they would likely be secondary feelings, instead of dominating the family's attitude.\n8.

So, the correct answer is B: happiness.\n\nInput: What will occur with many items when they go through the laundering machine? Choices:  Loss of colour A: B: C: D: E:\nOutput: 1, In a laundry machine, clothes would usually be washed, dried, and ironed.\n2. From the given options, the item going through it will lose colour and shrink after it enters the laundry machine.\n3. This is likely due to the aggressive nature of the wash cycle and the use of harsh detergents.\n4. Shrinking is the likely result of the dyes breaking down and separating from the fibres due to the powerful detergents. \n5. Similarly, the harsh wash cycle can result in colours fading and weakening over time.\n6. As the wash cycle gets aggressive, colours get faded and shrunk. \n7. Therefore, option A (loss of colour), B (shrinking), and C (fading) are the top 3 answers, and the least fitting is E (shining).\n8.Even though shining is a possible outcome of laundry appliances, it's not the most common one.\n9.

Choices: A: health B: politics C: race D: religion E: science\nOutput: 1.\"It's not uncommon\" essentially means that it's not an isolated occurrence to come across an expert's views on something questionable.\n2. The question then asks us to pick a word from the given five options that best describe an 'expert's views'.\n3. While the experts' views may be different for each of the given options, not all experts, or views of experts, are considered questionable.\n4. For example, it is understandable that a politician's actions may not align with public interests as they are more likely to serve an individual or institutional interest. However, this does not mean that all politicians are questionable.\n5. Similarly, it is also reasonable that some racial views can be considered detrimental to others; however, once again, the views of a single individual are not reflective of the views of others in that same race.\n6. We also see that some of the options are reflective of the opinions of a particular religion or race and the views of these individuals may not reflect those of the entire community.\n7. Hence, it is not enough to base an expert's credibility on their views on a given topic, as one's opinions may reflect those of the individual and not their entire race, culture, or religion.\n8. To truly determine if an expert's views are questionable, one must review the individual's overall record, conducting proper fact-checking and investigation, and speaking with the individual to understand their views in more depth and how they have affected the general public.\n9. It is not enough to point out the views as they may not represent the views of others in the same field, race, culture, religion, etc.\n10. Hence, the best answer", "answer": "E: larger house"}

With the coronation of a new monarch, a new queen or king can replace the currently reigning queen, and the country can have two monarchs at the same time (as mentioned here).\n6.

The toy store doesn't provide an engrossing experience because it is a commercial space with many other customers around, which may be confusing or overbearing for children.\n7. Similar to this, the soccer field has a set routine for participants, with limited variety and a fixed goal of being better at a sport, which may not always be possible or appealing for anyone, let alone children.\n8.

The question in the sentence was in the form of 'The little girl was raised' which means that she has been raised by her parents by the date on which the question is asked. She is asking a question about she has been asked.\n3. The little girl has been raised in a manner that implies she did not care when she was doing something bad or wrong.\n4. But, the second part of the sentence says that she didn't care when she was doing a certain thing. So, the 'when' points to an action performed or decision undertaken by the little girl.\n5. Looking at the options: A: crack isn't an appropriate word choice as it\u2019s referring to the little girl and not an action or decision.\nB: antipathy refers to an emotional state, so could indicate whether she is happy or sad while undertaking a task, but not carelessness.\nC: being mean is a behavior choice, not a carelessness choice, so again, not a suitable option.\nD: disinterest refers to lack of interest, not in carelessness\nE: unfeeling doesn't fit the context of being raised in a selfish manner\nTherefore, since all 5 options are unsuitable and there is no way of determining what the little girl was doing when being so careless, the most suitable answer is B - lack of awareness.\nSo the final choice is B: lack of awareness\n\nInput:I didn't know about you until yesterday afternoon when I got a what?

We understand this is a choice question, as there are a variety of locations where a ficus plant could brighten up a room, and the one that best fits the sentence would be the correct one.\n3. The options mentioned include; a palace, dictionary, pots, apartment etc. This indicates that location is key in determining where a ficus plant should brighten up a room.\n4. The first option, \u2018middle east\u2019 is unlikely as the plant is described as a ficus, which originally comes from the tropics of Asia and Africa.\n5. \u2018Palace\u2019 is too grand, as a ficus plant can simply brighten up any room, and might not look suitable in a palace setting.\n6. Hence, the three remaining options are a mix of locations (\u2018Dictionary\u2019 and \u2018POTS\u2019) as well as room types (\u2018Apartment\u2019).\n7.

These words aren't appropriate to the context, which refers to physical discomfort of a person, not something related to movement.\n5. Looking through the options, we determine that C: Feet are anatomical terms and can't be used for describing unpleasantness.\n6. Similarly B: Moving Forward isn't a term used for describing problems, and even if it was, it would be used to describe a physical state of the person, not some kind of feeling.\n7.

Next, we have to determine what the expression \"also this\" represents  or stands for.\n5.) We can eliminate the options B and C as they don't quite capture the essence of the phrase: B stands for reverse; C stands for backwards.\n6.) The quote as a whole doesn't say \"also this\" means reverse or backwards, but rather that they are synonyms, so B \"go forth\" can only be the other half of the phrase, as forward is what the quote describes, and the expression is that you \"going forth\" and \"also this,\" which can only be \"going backwards.\"\n7.) Therefore, we can eliminate options C and D, as the quote doesn't suggest that a person going forward will also need to go \"back and forth\" to go backwards.\n8.)

{"text": "1.\"Where can you store your tent?\" suggests that you have a tent and need to place it somewhere.\n2. The context indicates that it is possible that you are on a camping trip, as the phrase \"you are camping\" suggests.\n3. In this case, storing your tent would require either a tent site or your backpack.\n4. However, the question is about a campsite, implying that your tent will be near other people and is not allowed to be left by the side of the road.\n5. Therefore you would not store your tent there and the question is only left with one possible answer.\n6. Out of the four options, \"backpack\" is the most logical as it is the only option that allows you to keep something on your person.\n7.

On the other hand, \u201cwoods\u201d and \u201csleeping in while camping\u201d are both a bit vague.\n9. \u201cCampground, woods\u201d would not make the most sense as you could not store your tent at a campsite and sleeping while camping suggests you would be in your tent.\nSo the final  answer  is A: backpack.\n\nInput: Is your patience a virtue? Choices: 1. Yes\n2. No \nOutput: 1. \"Is your patience a virtue\" suggests that there might be some doubt in your skills of patience.\n2. \"Virtue\" refers to moral excellence of a quality to serve as guide in conduct.\n3. As such, the question can be interpreted as to whether patience can be seen as a  guiding characteristic.\n4. To be able to answer this question,  we need to understand the definitions of those two things.\n5. 'Patience' is defined as \"the ability to wait calmly without being impatient\" and 'virtue' is  defined as \"a good moral quality that is a valuable part of someone's character\".\n6. If we look at the context of the question where \"Is your patience  a virtue\" is used, we conclude that the question is about whether or not patience  can be seen as a character  of superior moral quality.\n7.

It gives information that Lindy does not want to go to an old people\u2019s home.\n3. We can see that the old people\u2019s home is a place that a senior citizen would go for his living.\n4. The other places where he could live are a senior citizen home or a park.\n5. In this context, the most feasible choice for Lindy to move to is an office rather than a senior citizen\u2019s home or a park where he could live when he is old.\nSo the final answers is A: office\n\nInput: It's so hot outside that you'd almost sweat if it wasn't for your _____.

Also, the good things in life aren't necessarily related to a person's personal life, which is more the domain of counseling and therapy.\nacknowledgment - It would be odd to speak about one receiving acknowledgment in the context of counseling, particularly if it's on such a large scale.\n4 The question suggests seeking clarification or assistance on how to interpret one's life and the events in it.\n5 The option A:  to be heard is not relevant, since the question is not about someone else listening to you.\n6 The option B: receive gifts seems too dramatic for a counseling scenario.\n7 The option C: understand themselves doesn't sound significant enough to require counseling.\n8 The option D: the good things in life would be too ambiguous and broad for the question as it mentions a single item.\n9 The option E:  acknowledge might be true but isn't the most applicable contextually.\n10 This narrows the options to A because it clearly refers to emotional support.\nSo the final option of A is to be counseled for emotional support.\n\nInput: If she had read the manual she'd be able to explain how to fix the dishwasher.

The region has high elevations in the northern hemisphere and is home to several tiger subspecies.\n3. All the given options lie in Asia and the subcontinent's tiger population has dropped drastically from more recent time. \n4. However, options B and C are more narrow in their application since the Caucasus is an isolated area in the northern hemispheres.\n5. All other three options are much wider in their application since not only do they span many Asian countries but they also include the subcontinent' home of tigers.\n6. Since the question specifically states that tigers live in this world, we can eliminate option E.\n7. Since the option A is much narrower in its application it can be eliminated as well.\n8.

{"text": "1: The question refers to the scenario where an old barn is no longer in good condition and has to be demolished before a new one can be constructed.\n2. We see that the old barn needs to be destroyed before it can be rebuilt.\n3. Therefore, the correct option would be to destroy it with a demolition machine.\n4. In this context, the word 'raising' can easily replace 'destroying' and would be incorrect.\n5. The word 'enticing' suggests persuading or attractive someone to do something, which doesn't apply to this context.\n6. Furthermore, the word 'fix', though accurate in terms of the word's literal meaning, is incorrect because it doesn't imply that the old barn will be destroyed before a new one can built.\n7. Therefore, the only correct option would be D: demolishing it.\nSo the final word is D: demolishing it\n\nInput: The young boy didn't know the difference between the two books.

He did what? Choices:A: make the menu B: fix the sink C: run the entire hotel D: set the room price E: take care of the guests\nOutput: 1 The question makes reference to a maid taking care of guests at a hotel.\n2 The maid cannot make the menu, fix the sink, or take care of guests (options A, B, and E) since she is not a member from any of these departments. The maid could run the entire hotel since she is the manager but the option must be D. This answer is not only the only possibility but the only realistic possibility as well.\n3 The maid cannot set the room price.\n4 There are only two people in the hotel, but the maid cannot be one of them as she is already the manager.\nSo the final possible answer is D: run the entire hotel.\n\nInput: I don't get nervous before shows anymore, I've been doing this for too long to care now what?

To satisfy this curiosity, a person could hear testimony from someone who has been there, or go to the place they want to learn about, or go to an outdoor concert that may represent the place, or look at things represented like through art or exhibits, or go online to a resource related to the place.\n3. Of these options, only A, testimony, and E, internet, represent these options.\n4. However, we can eliminate the incorrect answer E, because it could refer to a website that is about the place you can't leave, rather than providing information of the place itself.\n5. In other words, the internet only helps you learn about the place, but doesn't actually provide a view of the place unlike hearing testimony from someone who's been there.\n6. Thus, testimony will help in satisfying the curiosity of having to learn about something when you can not leave home.\nSo the final answers is: A, hearing testimony\n\nInput: Who would you most likely learn from about the history of the great pyramids?

{"text": "1: The question suggests that waiting for the doctor is difficult for people who need work done.\n2. Waiting for the doctor requires the patient to be at the location where the doctor is located or reside in the vicinity, which is likely where they work, or there would require a leave which is time consuming.\n3. There is mention of 'work' that would need to be done which is difficult since patients often have long wait times.\n4. However, there is no mention of being on a phone, or trying to use the time for work, which are irrelevant to the question, nor is there any sign of being late or impatient.\n5. The only viable answer here is that waiting for a doctor's appointment is difficult because the waiting time is time consuming.

Choices: A: country roads B: traffic C: hills D: highways E: highways and hills\nOutput: 1 The question poses a scenario about trying out a used car.\n2. It suggests that good way to ensure the quality of a used is to test the car out on some roads.\n3. Amongst all the choices, some are clearly impossible - such as highways and hills or even highways are not possible to test a used car as many would not be in that condition.\n4. Choices B (traffic) A(country roads) and E (highway & hill) don't make sense and contradict each other since trying out the car in these conditions might affect it's performance.\n5. Choice C (hills) makes the most sense since hills would be a real test of it as it would be necessary for the car to climb up hills for it to reach desired condition, as one would rarely test used cars out in these conditions.\n6. Thus, the correct answer to this question is choice C: hills.\nSo the final option is C: hills\n\nInput: If only a dozen cows on one farm were ill enough to be declared unfit for slaughter what would we expect to occur?

Choices:  B: friends C: enemies D: foes E: family members F: intruders\nOutput: 1: The question asks what a bookworm doesn't want to find behind their shelf.\n2. From the story we can assume that there are family members behind the shelf and are hiding from the bookworms.\n3. There is also a chance that there might be an intruder who is trying to hide from the bookworm.\n4. The two most important reasons for why being hidden from someone would be a bad thing is fear of danger or exposure to harm.\n5. If the bookworm doesn' t want to be in danger or harm then it means the bookworm would want to see an intruder hiding from them.\n6. A family member is someone with whom a person carries affection and concern for.\n7. Therefore, by process elimination, E: family members is the best option and the right answer is E: family members.\nSo the finals answer is E: family member", "answer": "C: shopping mall"}

This is the only option that gives a connotation of innovation or modernism.\n5. All other answers would be a bit of a jumble of words without much clarity.\n6. So the answer to this question is C: An innovator.\nSo the final Answer is D: An innovator", "answer": "E: protests"}

{"text": "1: The question asks where people typically store their curling iron.\n2. The options given are: bathroom, walkway, use, hair salon, and drawer\n3. Since 'bathroom' refers to the bathroom in a home (not a hair salon or a public one), 'walkway' doesn't relate to storing the curling iron, and 'use' is ambiguous\n4. 'Hair salon' is an option that could be used, but 'hair salon' is also an option since 'hair' is the object of storage (not the person storing the curling iron), and 'hair salon\" doesn't refer to the curling iron in storage.\n5.

The meaning of drawer matches with the given context, and thus is the most suitable answer.\nSo the answer, and final answer is D: Drawer", "answer": "E: drawer"}
{"text": "1: The question here wants us to understand the meaning of a'master carpenter' and 'put holes in objects'.\n2. Here,'master carpenter', is someone very skilled and experienced.\n3. We know a master carpenter would have lots of tools, like drills and sponges, he'd be using to do his work.\n4. Therefore, by the context, the 'put holes in objects' option would also likely be talking about the master carpenter using his tools.\n5. Now, by the options given:\n6. Learning and understanding refer to getting information or knowledge from a source, which is not the same as a master carpenter putting holes in an object.\n7. By this line of reasoning, the other options seem unnecessary.\n8. The remaining options, drilling and spooning, point to the same thing, i.e. either the master carpenter puts holes in objects by drilling them or he uses a spoon to put holes in objects.\n9. However, all drills have a sharp, pointed or tapered bit that serves as a drilling tool.\n10. So, we can deduce that all drills essentially serve the same purpose of making holes.\n11. 'Spoon' is an uninteresting option that we can deduce might potentially contain holes.\n12. Therefore, by process if elimination, we can deduce the answer is B: drilling.\n13. So, by the end of the reasoning, the answer would be B: using drilling.\nSo the final ans: Choices:  A is uninformative,  B: using drilling\n\nInput: He had a long drive ahead, but there was ample time, so he took a nap.

All the options are likely given simply to give a perspective on what the answer may be.\n3. Since a door handle is designed to operate a door, bottles and tubes, unlike doors/handles, have no moving parts\n4. Buckets have moving parts(handle).\n5. Plastic bags, in contrast, are neither a good handle nor an appropriate material for a handle.\n6. Corks, on the other hand, do share properties with buckets(moving parts).\n7. This may be a clue or something to consider,  although, corks aren\u2019t generally meant to be operated/moved.\n8. However, corks are often used to make stoppers or as a seal for liquid tight bottles.\n9. Therefore while a bottle may have a cork in it, it would be impractical to use a cork as a door handle.\n10. Moreover, since we are talking about a door handle, corks are excluded.\n11. Though none of the given options in the question have any handle, only C: a bucket is suitable for a door handle.\nSo the final solution is C: bucket.\n\nInput: How would one refer to a place of residence for a student at Harvard?

As for, 'look for' is correct though but it can't be the best answer to ask since saying thank you is the only correct phrase that should be said.\n6. Also, if we were to say that we are'showing appreciation' that doesn't make sense to be the best phrase to ask since to show appreciation is to express thanks.\n7.

The options mentioned are 'riots', 'vote', 'change yourself','social activism' and 'change clothes'.\n4. 'riots' and 'vote' focus more on large-scale or government-led change, while 'change yourself' and'social activism' refer to more personal and less systemic changes.\n5. As for the last option 'change clothes', it may be an attempt to poke fun at fashion.\n6. The best option to choose from the list would be D: social activism.\n7. Being a'social activist' refers to taking direct, individual action in order to improve society for the betterment of those around you.\n8. So, we can eliminate A: riots, B: vote, and C: change yourself and answer that D: social activism is best suited for changing society for the better.\nSo, the final answer is D which is: social activism\nOutput: 1: The question talks about the best option to start changing society for the better\n2: The different options given for change are Riots, Vote, change yourself, Social Activism and changing clothes.\n3: Riots and vote are not suitable answers as their aim is not individual change rather than large scale collective change which is usually done through government or mass media. And voting is not the solution to changing everything.\n4: Changing clothes is not a suitable answer for the question as the aim is to change the society rather than clothes.\n5: So, the best option for change is social Activism as it is the simplest and can be done by a single person\nSo the final answer to this question is D:Social Activism\nOutput: \n1. The question focuses on the fact that all of those in the military must have their weapons in good working order.\n2.

{"text": "1.,In order to understand why the answer should be D it is essential to understand what yard is.\n2. It can be defined as an amount of area used for residential or business purposes, or the length of space between two lines on a sports court.\n3. Based on this meaning, the answer choice, 'yard', is used to denote the metric system for unit of length, which would be used for measuring the length of a 'yard'.\n4. Therefore, the answer choice for the question statement, 'a yard is made up of _____?', should be 'length of space between two lines'.\n5. To identify which length measurement would best fit this meaning, it can be observed that the metric system of measurement has many terms based on yard, such as'meter' (length of space between two metre lines) and inch (length of space between 'two inches').\n6. To understand the difference between the two possible choices, the first option is defined as 'city', which refers to a central urban area with a high population density, while the second option, 'Michigan', refers to the state of Michigan, USA.\n7. Based on these definitions, it is clear that an option would be more suitable for measurement unit rather than for population density.\n8. Therefore, considering these factors, the best option for the question would be 'Yard is made up of three feet'.\n9. This answer choice describes the exact length of space between two 'yard' lines, without reference to any population density or specific areas in the state or country.\n10. For example, for basketball, the 'yard line' is defined as the distance between the two lines on the court.\n11. In conclusion, the final answer would be D: 'A yard is made up three feet.'\nSo the final answer would be: Choice D- A yard is made up of three yards.\n\nInput: A pizza box contains exactly three times the amount of ingredients on a what?

However, children would likely avoid going to the \"wrong house\" because it would be a dangerous place for them.\n6: Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that they would choose to go there if they were confused.\n7: The right answer should describe instead of merely mentioning a place.\n8: From this logical deduction, we may eliminate the options \"play chess\" and \"wrong house\".\n9: The question also suggests that children are going home rather than trying to complete a task.\n10: The remaining options suggest going to safe or close places with the exception of the final option which  indicates going to gettable.\n11: The question is asking for the \"wrong house\", so we can reject the answer \"play chess\" because it doesn't make any mention of the \"wrong house.\"\n12: The answer is also inconsistent with the question, \"Gettable\" seems like a word that would be used for a place where children can go to find something, not where they would go when they get confused.\n13: The remaining options are all close-by places  that indicate a homeward-bound course, implying they would be likely destinations for children who get lost.\n14: Choosing between the remaining available places is difficult to discern from the statement but since the answer should be a place where children can walk and children would not stay in an unsafe place such as a sunny yard or a table, the right answer is either  playground or park.\nSo the final  answer is B: a playground\n\nInput: How can one make a sandwich?

The other way of interpreting the sentence could be to claim that old people no longer remember what the world was about in the past.\n4. The first alternative is not possible as old people are aware of the current situation in the world and they continue to experience changes in their everyday life.\n5. Therefore the second alternative is the only correct choice.\n6. Old people have forgotten what the previous generations were and what they did, but they are also aware of the newest technologies and modern ways of living.\n7.

However, we do not know whether or not we slept the previous night or the entire day. However, it can be safely assumed that we did not get good quality sleep the earlier night. The word rest can also refer to a time to unwind or relax. The question asks how we are feeling. The options given are: A. EXHAUSTED: This is completely the opposite of how we are feeling. We do not feel drained and exhausted. The question is asking us how we are feeling at this point in time and not how we were feeling after a day of intense work and sleep depravation (as this would imply that we were EXHAUSTED). B. WORKED ALL DAY: Yes, we have been working all day, but we do not feel drained or exhausted at this point in time. Working all day does not equal feeling EXHAUSTED. Rather, being at this moment in time would require an active verb, (i.e. we have not been physically active for long). C. WERE VERY TIRED: This sounds like something that happened to us in the past and is not a current state of being. The word \"were\" is the past tense of the verb \"to be\". The question is asking how we are feeling currently. D. FEEL BETTER: The question asks us how we are feeling, not how we felt in the past. So the answer is NOT Feel Better.\n5.)

Choices:  (1) (A) hand tools and machine B) machine tools (2) (C) machine tools (A) hand tools (3) (D) computer-controlled (A) cutting tool (B) cutting edge (C) cutting edge (3) hand tools machine tools\nOutput: 1b. When choosing between the different options from the choice lists the first sentence can be considered a question and the third sentence can be considered a hint.\n2b. Since the question asks which of the mentioned options can be used it does not make much sense to take the hint into account.\n3b. The first sentence mentions hand tools and machine, which are not options to choose from in the choice list.\n4b. The third sentence mentions cutting edge and cutting tools, which are both from the available options.\n5b. Machine tools which are not from the list are hand tools, so this is eliminated. It is not appropriate to look for the hint for the third sentence as it is not the whole sentence anymore, it is a part of the sentence and does not have to be consistent as it is only a small part of an answer. The complete sentence now says \"using computer-controlled cutting tools\" which is not from the choice list.\n6b. The second sentence says cutting edge and cutting tools which is not the whole sentence and thus can", "answer": "D: poker game"}

{"text": "1.'Fiddle' is not an uncommon word.\n2. It can be commonly be confused for the verb 'fight'.\n3. So, the more specific terms we can use when the real verb is intended are 'fiddle away' and 'fiddle playing'.\n4. Accordingly, the best answer to the question would be D: a place where people fiddle.\n5. A fiddle is a type of stringed musical instrument, typically having four strings tuned like a violin.\n6. It is used in bluegrass music and is also known as a 'bowed fiddle'.\n7. So, we can infer that a fiddle is usually played by a person sitting or standing, holding a bow in one hand and the instrument in the other.\n8. Therefore, the people who play the fiddle would gather in a place known for fiddle playing, or a place that is hosting a fiddle event at that time.\n9. Since D: a place where fiddle playing happens is mentioned as the best answer, a place of fiddle playing that can have around 'tens of thousands' of people playing or tuning their fiddles will have such a large venue that will be impossible to identify.\n10. So the final answer is E, the place known for fiddle playing that can have 'tens of thousands of fiddle players' is 'fiddle conventions'.\nSo the final answer Is E: fiddle concerts\n\nInput: When there is such a huge gap between rich and poor, how does that look for the middle class?

Choices: A: Sing to them\nB: Draw pictures\nC: Make them scent-based gifts\nD: Touch them and listen to their feedback\nE: Focus all attention on your own needs\nOutput: 1- Since you would not need language, other methods of communicating have to be used; for example the use of sign language. 2- Since this cannot be a voice or lip-reading communication, sign language has to be visual. 3- As plants lack any senses associated with vision, any form of sign language will be ineffective in case of plant/plant communication. You cannot communicate visually or sign-based with plants without any sense in them. 4- Touching plants and listening to their feedback will work only if the plants themselves are able to \"speak\" or \"send messages\". This option doesn't make sense in terms of the given conditions.\n5- This option involves direct communication and it can be effective if the plant can speak (e.g. birds or some other animals), but it is incorrect to assume that all organisms can engage in direct communication without any sensory organs.\n6- \"Focus all attention on your own\" does not explain the required answer for the option \"a plant does not have a lot to say\". 7.- The only way to communicate with a plant is to send it \"messages\" through the means of other senses (e.g. smell), or directly touch it. 8- It does not make sense for a plant to send smell-based messages to other plants unless they can sense the given smell. 9- Plants don't have any senses to receive gifts, they cannot receive the gift that you are sending and \"make them scent-based\" gift to other plants unless plants", "answer": "A: math book"}

The reflection of moonlight on Earth is called Earthshine (or the 'the moonlit side of the Earth'), with the bright or dark side of the Moon depending on the amount of illuminated area of the Earth.\n5. In addition, from the question, we know that the location is the wilderness and there is also the mention of 'outer space', which suggests that we are looking for an answer that is related to space as well.\n6.

Looking at the question itself, the options provided are locations, while 2 locations are excluded:\n   - Home\n   - Street/shop\n4. This may indicate that the clothing must be purchased from the street/shop.\n5. However, while it is reasonable that the clothing was from a local street shop, it is not consistent with the other given information - the clothing was expensive.\n6. So, from these we can say that the clothing was likely to be purchased from a \"department store\" since that option was not explicitly mentioned in the question.\n7. Therefore, the most reasonable option is D: department store\n\nInput: It was in the middle of May when she decided to return to college, where did she study? Choices: 1 A: Paris\n2 B: New York\n3 C: San Francisco\n4 D: London\n5 E: Tokyo\nOutput: 1.. The question states that the person decided to return to college in May.\n2. The person mentions that she was studying in college when she decided to return, implying that the college was the location where she studied.\n3. The options provided are as follows: - Paris\n- New York\n- San Francisco\n- London\n- Tokyo\n4. The person studied in college, so the college must have been in one of these cities.\n5. The options provided are Paris, New York, San Francisco, London, and Tokyo.\n6. While Paris and New York are cities with top-ranking universities/colleges, in general, it does not specify whether the person studied in Paris or New York, so we can dismiss those options.\n7. San Francisco, London, Tokyo are cities that are not mentioned specifically in the question, so we can also dismiss those options.\n8. However, we know that the person studied in college, and the college was in one of those cities.\n9. This leaves us with the option C: San Francisco since there is no evidence to the contrary.\n10. Based on this new information, the final answer is C: San Francisco.", "answer": "B: mall"}
{"text": "1.The question provides insight into John's personality and his aversion to having a child even though he was in a relationship.\n2. John was referred to as an old-fashioned male who may have had difficulty or distaste to get his partner pregnant.\n3. The expression in the question \"John didn't like to ___\", refers to the act of sexual intercourse which is considered a \"hangup\" by some as it's not everyone\u2019s cup of tea.\n4. Therefore, to answer the question, 'Why John didn't want a baby with his girlfriend?' we need to consider the options given.\n5. However, options A(orgasm), B(cum) and D(naked in bed) are related more to sexual foreplay and can't be considered as significant for a father-to-be to get an erection and successfully have a baby.\n6. Option C(wearing his birthday suit) might not have been a problem as it's usually accepted as part of the sexual experience.\n7. So in conclusion, it's most likely that John did not like to be in the act of having a baby.\nTherefore E: Wearing his Birthday Suit is the correct answer\nSo the final answer E: Wearing his birthday suit", "answer": "C: naked"}
{"text": "1 and 2. From the given options, A, B and C sound somewhat related to being competitive but C is the most related.\nIt states that reaching an advantage position in a competition puts one in a superior position as compared to others.\n\n3. We understand that A and B sound very closely related and there is no clear separation between them.\n4. B states that reaching an advantage puts one in an upper hand position and one can say that being in the upper hand position gives an advantage, but this can be said to be similar to what B states and does not define the position clearly.\n5. The next options C, D and E state that being in an advantage position puts you in a higher position as compared to others, a higher position than your competitors or a higher position than your peers.\n6. We thus conclude that being in an advantageous position puts one in an superior or higher position than others.\n7.

It is said that even though his disability did not affect his brain in an intellectual sense, people often treated him with a childishness that was more mental than physical.\n3.

The key here is to consider the options in relation to his personality (physical) and his potential (mental)\n\u201cStrength\u201d does not seem to be a correct answer as it generally refers to physical capacity and is not related to his disability.\n\u201cBrain\u201d would only be a correct choice if his disability was a mental one. However, the context suggests that this wasn't the case, thereby making it not applicable.\n\u201cPotential\u201d may be related to the mental aspect of his disability, but it is not clear that it refers to his mental capacity which is not relevant in this context.\n\u201cQualification\u201d is relevant as it involves his potential, but seems to refer to a specific academic qualification or professional certification, which is not relevant in the given context.\nTherefore, the most correct answer is \u201cCompetence\u201d. This option fits best with the context because \u201ccompetence\u201d refers to a person\u2019s ability to perform a task or role, which aligns with the idea that his disability did not hinder his qualifications.

Similarly, \"to be well-liked\" and \"to be admired by others\" may also not be correct as we may be well-liked by friends and family but not by those outside our social circle.\n5.

However, the question could also be viewed as being more specific because if someone stores their small chess set, then they should also be storing individual pawns belonging to it.\n5. In this case, if E: small case means an actual or real one, it wouldn't make much sense to store one of our chess pawns in it.\n6. This means that E: small case only makes sense if it refers to our own made collection of chess pawns.\n7. In this case, options D: chess game and E: small case can be considered good answers to the question.\n8.

Choices:  A. True B. False\nOutput: 1.\u201cIn order for me to appreciate the art, I need the _____ of the artist upon the art.\u201d\n2. \"Appreciate\" is a transitive verb, which means that the action of \"appreciate\" only fully takes place when it is performed on someone or something.\n3. Appreciation in this context refers to the experience or enjoyment of art, so it is not enough to have the art to appreciate it.\n4. It is also noteworthy that \"art\" is not specifically stated in the sentence, but the intended meaning is implied.\n5. Therefore \"signature on art\" should be read as \"artist's signature\" since \"on art\" cannot make sense.\n6. The word \"signature\" means the artist's name, therefore \"the artist's signature is required upon the art to fully appreciate\" means that the artist's name must be there on the product for us to appreciate.\n7. So, the final answer is B: False, because without the artist's name on the product, it is impossible to fully appreciate it.\n\nInput: I feel that learning English is a better choice than learning another language.

For example, The Moment of Truth, a popular game show that highlighted the negative qualities of contestants, featured contestants answering questions about a range of topics, including their personal lives and embarrassing moments.\n4. Most contestants would be likely to reveal personal information and experiences that they would not typically discuss in public.\n5. Thus, the show, which was broadcasted live, would have featured a lot of garbage information.\n6. So, all options except fox news should be considered suitable.\n7. \"Television\" refers to watching garbage on television and the \"dumpster\" and \"landfill\" are physical garbage dumps, and \"trash can\" refers to physical garbage and \"Fox News\" is a reputable, informative news channel.\n8.

D: he was a guest at your wedding\nOutput: 1 : The question asks how he knew that you were married.\n2. We are given a list of possible reasons why one could suspect another person to be married.\n3. However it is not clear how he knows you are married.\n4. It therefore becomes imperative to analyse what information is missing from the scenario.\n5. We learn that your fianc\u00e9e was with him and he has either seen you with her or been invited to your wedding.\n6. It is unlikely you will have introduced yourself to him by saying that you are married, and even if you have, it would not be sufficient to be able to know that you are married based only on that information.\n7.

{"text": "1.\"Beaver builds structures\" in the question indicates a process that is usually associated with humans.\n2. This suggests the context of the question involves the characteristics associated more with humans than other animals.\n3. This means we need to eliminate the irrelevant options and focus on those that are more humans-oriented.\n4. The question describes the beaver building a structure to block a \"zoo\" or \"animal's body of water\" but those options are not what we are looking for since they are not related to humans.\n5. This leaves us with the only relevant options - \"book\" and \"wooded area\".\n6. We eliminate \"book\" because the context requires us to focus on characteristics that are associated more with humans than animals.\n7. We are left with \"wooded area\" since beavers are associated with blocking wood, but as per the choice options, \"animal's wooded\" is not what is being blocked and the word \"wooded\" is not mentioned alongside the word 'feature'.\n8. Therefore, from the context and the options, we conclude that the correct answer is D: \"beaver's wooded area\".\nSo the final answer\n\nInput:He was surprised to see ____, he thought they had long ____ it out of stock. Choices:  A. a full shelf, run out of B. to see, lasted C. no shelf, sold D. a new shelf, sold E. no shelf, run out\nOutput: 1:\"to see\" - This is unlikely a word used in shopping, more likely a phrase used by witnesses to a crime.\n2.\"he thought it had long ___ out of stock\" - since this part of the sentence is about how something should have been out of stock, \"it\" is probably referring to the shelf.\n3. \"long\" and \"lasted\" are synonyms, so it makes sense that these would be close options.\n4. \"sold\" is unlikely the choice that explains \"be surprised to see something\"; the answer instead should explain why the shelf was not empty.\n5. \"a full shelf\" probably isn't the right answer since \"surprised\" usually signals that something is not as expected.\n6. \"a new shelf\" is likely the right answer since \"it's amazing to see a", "answer": "C: body of water"}

There is no any sentence that contains \"come up with a great idea\", in sentence \"all your friends\", the word in main clause and target word is \"are\" and in sentence \"great idea\", the word in main verb is \"come up with\" so this sentence is not matching.\n5. In sentence \"your friends\" the word in main clause is \"you'll tell to\" and target word in sentence is \"will tell to\"\n6.\"tend\" is present participle form and \"tell\" is context in following sentence \"I'll tell to all my friends\".\n7.

{"text": "1.. The question presents the premise of the traders working on the floor of the Stock. \n2. The floor, referred to as \"the trading floor\", is a term for the area on which the traders sit and work.\n3. It is typically a large room, where many traders may work, often with rows of desks facing each other.\n4. The term floor usually refers to the physical space, i.e. the concrete or tile floor, as opposed to the walls or ceiling.\n5. It is also typically an area where the traders are present in person as opposed to calling in for their trades.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the trader's work is done on the trading floor, which is what they are likely to be working on.\n7. Eliminating the other options, A, \"building\", seems irrelevant because it is only a reference to the location of the traders, and not to their activity; B, \"hallway\", implies that the trader' work is done somewhere else; C, \"table\", seems too casual because a trading floor is typically a large room with rows of desks and an area for the traders to sit; and D and E, \"exchange\" and \"office\", may be related to the office space outside the trading floor, but not to the trading floor itself, where the trader's actual work is done.\n8.

{"text": "1: The question asks about the consequences of rumors of roving bands killing people.\n2. Rumors of bands of murderers could lead to panic, getting in trouble, or mass hysteria.\n3. However out of the given choices; panic, mass hysteria, and getting in trouble are more relevant.\n4. Panic might lead to people fleeing or hiding as they become anxious and are no longer willing to take risks.\n5. Mass hypocrisy involves a large group of people being in agreement about something without any basis for that agreement.\n6. Getting in trouble might involve someone being arrested or questioned by the police due to the belief that they were involved in the alleged crimes.\n7. Therefore, out of the given options panic is the most relevant answer as it is associated with an irrational and intense fear.\n8. However, if the person is innocent then they might also be punished for something they didn't do.\n9. Mass hysteria might also involve a large group of people all being convinced of something without any real evidence.\n10. Getting in trouble might be less likely if the person isn't actually guilty.\n11. Murder, or going to prison, might also be a possibility but as we previously established that most people think a rumor is untrue, this answer would be more if an alleged murderer is actually guilty of the crime.\n12. Therefore, a combination answer might also work i.e. the right answer is some combination of going to prison or panic, depending on whether the person is actually guilty or not.\nSo the final and more accurate answer is C: mass hysterical but it is panic.\n\nInput: The team won the game but only because of poor defense.

We know from the context of the question that the armchair is special in some way and is not a regular piece of furniture that anyone can sit on\n3.

The same can be said for a hospital, where patients come and go and the staff members rarely sit for long stretches of time.\n5.

The question refers to option 'A take a deep breath.')2.)The sentence has a meaning which has almost the same with 'It's not a good time to get angry'. 3.)The meaning of 'losing your temper' is shown as 'getting angry' in everyday English. 4.) So, the first sentence could be represented by 'Don\u2019t be angry'. Since 'angry' is also meant to show 'angry face', 'losing your temper', in this case can be replaced with 'angry', which means 'losing temper' in everyday English (Option C)  5.)The question refers to option D'read an inspirational quotation', but it seems like a strange choice since it is unrelated to regaining composure, the actual question. 6.) Therefore, option E 'walk away for a time' refers to what the author means:  'Don't walk away now'. 7", "answer": "C: walking"}
{"text": "1. We know that there are many ways in which two people could meet, according to the choices offered.\n2. However, out of all that is provided, the best option that allows people to \"meet with each other\" is to \"believe in God.\"\n3.

{"text": "1) The question asks what happens after exercising.\n2) Although all answers are valid, among them choice B: 'exhaustion' is the most fitting answer for this given context.\n3) We all know that a lot of energy is consumed as a result of exercising and this leads to becoming tired or exhausted. Therefore, in this scenario, choice B: 'exercise' is the most appropriate answer.\n4) Choice A:'relaxation' does not seem to be the most obvious match given the context of exercising. It is rather misleading as it actually happens after exercising for a long period of time.\n5) Choice C: 'energetic' is somewhat relating to the context as the exercise boosts one's energy but this does not happen immediately after exercising. It may happen after some time.\n6) Similarly choice D: 'become stronger' does not seem to match the given context. Exercising does not necessarily lead to becoming stronger but it is actually the other way around.\n7) Finally, choice E: 'use energy' does not seem to fit the context and the question as it is vague and misleading. For example, this can be seen as if one exercises it does not necessarily mean they will use energy.\nSo the final answers are B: exhaustion and E: energetic but B: exhaustion is the correct answer\n\nInput: Which is not a tool for making a list?

Choices:  J: read a book K: jog M: watch tv N: watch movies P: walk through a meadow Q: hike R: play chess\nOutput: 1 : The question asks for an activity that people can do alone\n2: J and K are good examples of activities people can do alone, but they don\u2019t really make a lot of sense in the context of the question since they imply physical activity\n3: M, N and P are not really activities, they are things that people do\n4: R may be an activity but it is less common than J, K, N, P\n5: Q, by the letter, makes sense since it is an activity involving physical activity\nSo the final answer the question is Q: hike\n\nInput: In the morning, she is likely to have a lot of trouble what?

However,'C: kitchen' and 'D: junk yard' seem irrelevant to the disposal of an icebox while the other options may be relevant.\n4. Though antique store doesn't seem like the right place to dispose of an ice box, we know that an item's value is determined by its age.\n5. Therefore option A: Antique store may not seem a right choice of disposal for an icebox but in a sense, an antique store is the best place to dispose of a broken ice box since its value is dependent on age.\n6. 'In the graveyard' would seem appropriate to dispose of an ice-box given the ice content of the icebox but then iceboxes were known to be widely used during colonial India.\n7.

Choices: A: 1 day, B: 3 months,  C: 53 years, D: 2 days, E: 9 months\nOutput: 1: When it is said that you may not care whether food is good or not, it is likely meant to be something of a negative.\n2: People who usually don't care about food, in other words someone who eats a lot of junk/fast food, generally will end up sick from doing so. Eating such unhealthy things is not good for your health.\n3: While it is not stated in the question that sickness is meant to be a negative or a positive, the latter is suggested by the second sentence which states that they have been sick for 9 months, which is obviously a long period of time.\n4: As eating unhealthy food for a long period of time would cause someone who has been sick for 53 years to be sick.\n5: It is also likely that the person does not know what good tasting food is as they have been eating it all their life.\n6: On the other hand a person who eats good tasting food for many years has a greater chance of staying healthy in the long term.\n7: However, as this is a multiple choice question the answer has one right and one wrong choice.\n8: As such if we take the sentence's overall meaning to eliminate wrong options it is likely that the correct choice is: \"9 months\"\n9: As this is a multiple choice the answer is: \"9 months\u201d\nSo the final answer option is C:", "answer": "E: fabric store"}
{"text": "1) The question asks us to choose the correct answer for the term 'after bringing eggs home from the grocery store'.\n2) Since eggs are a grocery item, they could be stored in an egg carton, the henhouse, or the box from the store. But, \"chicken coop\" is a non-existent term. Similarly, a supermarket is not how eggs would be stored at home.\n3) The grocery store is where we buy our eggs, but 'from the grocery store' does not mean 'in the grocery store'; it refers to bringing eggs home.\n4) Since the correct answer option for \"henhouse\" is E and not A, the answer should be A.\nSo the final correct answer is A: henhouse.\n\nInput: The pizza shop worker was so tired, he had a difficult time remembering all of what?

All the options listed are valid, and any of them could be used to fill the blank in that sentence.3.) For option A (What he \"was supposed to serve\"), there is a word missing. It should be \"what he was SUPPOSED to serve.\"\n4.) Option B is unnecessary.4.) Option E is worded as a question: \"who SENT him to work.\"\n5.) Option D uses the possessive case (\"the name of ______ chef\"), implying that the chef is one of the pizza shop employees. This makes that option incorrect because \"chef\" refers to an independent entity.\n6.) Hence, option D should be struck off.\n7.) The final option left is E : \"The pizza shop employee was so tired...\"\n8.) Hence, \"The pizza shop _______________________________________________.\"\n9.)

The other options all have a past tense verb, but not a \"preterit tense\" which means they describe earlier actions while \"preterit tenses\" tell us about what we did before. \n7. \"buy some\" shows us a present situation, so we should use a preterit tense.

{"text": "1: The question presents a scenario in which a grumpy person is shown as the narrator.\n2. One could assume that the narrator is grumpy because he is showing signs of unhappiness (eg, a headache).\n3. It is suggested that the narrator feels some self-awareness, but is unlikely to understand him or herself deeply.\n4. Compliments will usually come from someone who admires you, but the narrator seems to have a poor opinion of himself as evidenced by his complaints, so compliments aren\u2019t applicable.\n5. Having his own house would not necessarily make him happier since he can maintain the same grumpy mood without the pressure of renting or shared housing.\n6. Happiness is an abstract concept, so it's safe to assume that the narrator hasn't completely understood what happiness is to be able to obtain it.\n7. Therefore, by process elimination, the most likely answer is B: understand themselves.\n8. The choice that requires least cognitive stretch is B: understand themselves as the grumpy person probably doesn\u2019t possess much self-awareness or a good understanding of what makes them happy.\n9. Thus, the correct answer is B: understand themself.\nSo the final answers are B: understand themself", "answer": "A: headache"}

Given that there are many organisms that could cause problems under rocks but that not all of them are actually microbial organisms, we are looking for choices B, C, or D.\n3. \"Grocery store\" is certainly not where a fungus could grow undisturbed by sunlight.\n4. \"Fallen tree\" does not have any sunlight; rather, it is a place where sunlight may be exposed.\n5. Since there are places where fungi may be able to live relatively secludedly, we can reject choice E.\n6. Choice A makes sense, because many fungi are indeed able to live under rocks.\n7. However, choice B also makes sense, since fungi may live in the soil or manure, both of which are often found under rocks.\n8. Thus the answer could be B, but we could also be choosing C.\n9. Since we are trying to remove as many answers as possible, it would be smarter to remove choice C and go with choice A or B which still applies for both C and A.\n10. So the final answer is A or B (both answers are acceptable)\n\nInput: What might a person do after they see that their pet mouse, who they were sure was just asleep, was dead? Choices: 1.

Be quiet for an hour\nOutput: 1:\"Lament for an hour\" implies that the person does not immediately breakdown in tears after finding their pet mouse is dead, but instead experiences intense deep sorrow and grief for considerable amount of time.\n2:\"Cry for an hour\" similarly implies that the person experiences intense deep sorrow for a considerable amount of time, but does not have to break down in tears, just cry.\n3:\"Be very upset about it\" may also imply that the person is emotionally impacted in a powerful way, though this answer does not specify a timeline.\n4", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

Thus, the question is ambiguous.\n3) The options present three quotes about the value of Love from the bible.\n4) The last option, E: \"Love gives us strength to fight the evil\", is not a quote from the bible, thus it must be the answer.\nSo the correct answer is E: Love gives us the strength to fight the evil\n\nInput: What is the term for a person who gives gifts?

It is also mentioned that this road belongs to the toll way, a road which charges passengers that cross its path a fee.\n4. \"Arizona\" can't be the correct answer because Arizona does not refer to a place where many people cross its path to pay the toll.\n5. Next to it is \"Connecticut\". Although it is a road which charges its passers through the fee it charges but this road is not mentioned in any tollway list or its map\n6. Then comes the option \"a state\". Although it is also a road which charges people a fee for every crossings, we don't know where this road is located and hence this option is not suitable.\n7. Next to it is the option \"Good repair\". But this option is not referring to any road but a repair shop. So the option is also not suitable and we exclude it.\n8. Next to \"Good repair\" is the right answer \"Eastern United States\". As mentioned in the start of the question, the John D. Lodey is a tollway which refers to a common tollway in United States and Eastern United states are part of United States and connecticut is also present in the eastern part of US.

It can be presumed that the people the person is meeting are also meeting other people and are not strangers.\n3. 'Aloof' means to be cold, distant, detached or reserved while'self-important' means having an over exaggerated sense of self worth or importance.\n4. These two characteristics define someone who acts in a certain manner after meeting new people based on the given choices.\n5. Looking at the options, \u2018stress\u2019 is a possible negative reaction, as people are generally a bit anxious before meeting new people.\n6.

Libraries are also likely to keep books due to their association with books.\n5. Classrooms and desks are places that are often associated with being read or learning and hence more likely to be associated with books.\n6.

{"text": "1) The question is to identify the object that cats get into when ripping things apart.\n2) It doesn't seem reasonable that cats could get into a garage by simply ripping things apart. This is because a garage is an enclosed and locked structure.\n3) The most logical answer is that they get into a dog's mouth since they are known to be mischievous and destructive creatures.\n4) Also, the question uses the phrase \"when they are ripping things\" rather than \"if they are ripping things.\"\n5) This suggests that the author believes that cats actually do this behavior, and this behavior involves getting into a dog's  mouth, as dogs often swallow things that they find on the floor.\n6) Also, by reading the first few lines of the prompt, it is clear that cats are described as destructive and that they are often seen tearing up carpeting or rugs.\n7) So, in conclusion, the most logical answer is that cats get into a dog'\nso the final answer is C: Garage\n\nInput: Where do frogs go on a rainy day?

This would imply that there would be some sort of courtroom or legal situation related to spirituality.\n3. There are several places to listen to testimony, such as church, courtroom, theatre, etc.\n4. Courtroom is likely used as it is a place where testimony is given regularly.\n5. So the options for this question are the places where we can watch or listen to testimony.\n6. A: \"go to church\" would imply that the speaker is specifically attending a church to listen to testimony about spirituality.\n7. B: \"appear in court\" would imply that the testimony is being given in a courtroom, which is not in line with the context.\n8. C: \"watch soap operas\" is not at all related to spirituality and testimony.\n9. D: \"paying attention\" is not referring to any specific physical location, but rather to the act of paying attention to a testimony.\n10. E: \"go into court\" is unlikely since the speaker would be paying attention to the testimony, not giving their own.\n11.

As the question specifies that you do not plan to usethe chair, we can eliminate all the options except school and beach, as they are places you would usually go to.\n3. As you do not plan to return the chair, putting it in the closet would prevent it from gathering dust, but you are sure to open your closet at some point to pick out things, which would mean your chair has an increased chance of being broken.\n4. Similarly, putting it in the garage makes little sense as you cannot use your garage door to access your clothes.\n5.

This implies that they were not alone in the activity and would be joining others, most likely at someone else's house.\n4. We also know that the person was making sure to bring along food with them as there was a game.\n5. This allows us to eliminate the last two options; E: fairgrounds and F: table as the location would not require an outdoor area with plenty of space for a large group of people enjoying a big game.\n6.

Choices:  A leader B follower C boss D leader-manager E visionary\nOutput: 1 The sentence starts with the statement that a good leader doesn\u2019t ignore useful criticism from others, which helps establish the idea that a good leader is one who listens to everyone, regardless of rank.\n2. But it goes on to say that even though the leader listens to everyone and makes use of what they say, he still has a great vision of how to lead his group. 3. This implies that the leader is not simply a listener who blindly follows directives; rather they have their own ideas for the group and are willing to share their knowledge and expertise.\n4. The sentence finishes by saying that others don't dismiss the leader just as a visionary, which suggests that people recognize and respect the leader's ideas and insight.\n5.

From the sentence, we can conclude that the best title for a good leader is E: visionary.\nSo the final answ", "answer": "B: friend's house"}

None of the answers directly answer the question asked, though they may be relevant to children.\n4. The answers given are: 'Laugh' is something that can happen before going to play, but the question asks what the child did.  \n'Sit' could be seen as a preliminary step to go to play, but this isn't the exact action asked for.\n'Being entertained' is a general description of what entertainment often involves and a parent likely wouldn't ask this before a child's play, for example at a restaurant. \n'Math' could possibly be an activity related to playing.  However, the question is specific in time and not necessarily about future activities, though it could still be applicable.\nLastly, 'meet' may or may not be seen as an activity before going to play depending on the context in which the question is asked.  \n5.

'Incentive structures might be irrevocable' indicates that incentive structures might not be changeable or reversible.\n3. The two-character difference is'revocable', which does not appear in the sentence but reverses the meaning and signifies changeability or reversibility.\n4.

Choices: A: grapes B: peaches C: kumquats D: oranges\nOutput: The question asks about the ideal climate for a 'good crop' of what.\n1. The sentence indicates a preference for certain fruits.\n2. It provides some information on the fruit, but does not specify the season in which it would be grown.\n3. It implies that the ideal season would be warm and sunny, since grapes, peaches, and kumquats are all grown in the summer, while oranges are grown in the fall.\n4. Based on this information, the correct answer would be C: \"kumquats\".\n\nInput: The reason they won is because they did not want to what?

{"text": "1 2. The question is looking for the definition of regular glass.\n3. The first option given is 'weak', which may seem like it makes sense.\n4. However, we must think beyond the definition of weakness and consider what regular glass actually does do.\n5. Although regular glass may not be as strong as other types of glass, it still typically serves as a sufficient type of glass and is not necessarily weak.\n6. The next option 'fragile' is indeed a synonym of weak, but it is already provided as an option here, so it is eliminated.\n7. Option 'forceless' again is a similar synonym of weak, and is also a redundant option as it is the equivalent of 'fragile' anyway.\n8. Option 'normal or standard' is also provided as an option and similarly is redundant and does not help us find our answer.\n9. The options left are'regular' and 'flimsy'.\n10. 'Regular' means 'typical'.\n11. There cannot be'regular glass' if glass were not to start off as'regular' to begin with.\n12.

It is also said that they need to go through a normal sleeppcycle.\n2. The first option given, A, is the same as B, but since the option is B, then the second option needs to be replaced.\n3. There  are three options in C,'relaxation','sleep' and 'dizziness', which could potentially refer to what happens during a normal sleeppycle.\n4. As such, all the options need to be narrowed down and eliminated one by one.\n5.

To show sharpness, a person can display creativity, quick thinking, and a quick witted.  These traits are all examples of'sharp' or clever behavior.\n6. The last sentence implies that despite his sharpness, the subject could occasionally be careless with his calculations.  This leads us to believe that the subject was'sharp' but 'dull', since 'dull' would imply that he was not quick to notice or noticeable in his actions.\n7-9. 'Complimentary' means that a person or object may not be as effective or appealing on its own without the presence of something else.  To compliment something means to enhance its value or usefulness.  It could be used to describe the subject, whom being 'calculated', could be 'accurate' if the calculation was considered in its entirety, however, due to its 'dull' and 'ocean-like' behavior, it is not likely that the subject is accurate.\n10-12. 'Inelegant' means clumsily designed, and could be used to describe his calculations to which the subject is'sharp', but not necessarily quick.  'Ocean-like behavior' means that the calculations act rather like the sea by occasionally washing the subject's'sharpness' away.\n13. On a first read, options A, B, and C are very unlikely as they are all very complimentary traits that do not represent dull behavior.\n14-15. 'Dull' would still fit for E as it can refer to an object or action which lacks variety.  Since the subject was 'calculated' but occasionally did not seem like an accurate, it could be argued that he was 'lacking variety' in his calculations.\n16-17. There is a chance that 'inaccurate' could be used to replace 'dull', however, it does not add to the subject being'sharp'.  Instead, if the subject were inaccurate, he would simply seem blunt and not necessarily smart in general.\nSo the final choice is C: Dull\n\nInput: Some of the most vile things known to man were originally thought to be a", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

It could be that the man had meant to wait at the rich person's house but instead he came to the public square instead by mistake.\n5. But the rich person's country club is typically further away from the public square location, and other recreational areas such as pool and fitness centers are even nearer to the public square.\n6. So if the man actually came to public square accidentally, he\u2019s most likely to interpret it to the wrong location the public square was set at i.e.: the other end of the other recreational area nearer to public square like the country club or pool or fitness center.\n7.

There are 5 different traits, each one has a different meaning.\n3. First of all we have the 'lucky'.\n4. It could be inferred that John was the type of person who always tried hard, which means he wasn't the 'luckiest'\n5.

The author is talking about John's perseverance and determination in trying to achieve a goal, not his physical strength.\n7. Now let's see the next trait which is 'powerful'.\n8. Clearly John was not powerful in the question.\n9. It doesn't fit because he doesn't get to give away whatever he has to give.\n10. And finally, we have the 'courageous' trait.\n11.

{"text": "1. The question asks where kids play with a concrete ball.\n2. We know that a ball made of concrete is unlikely to be used for games that involve players moving or running.\n3. Instead, balls usually used for such games are usually made of rubber.\n4. For example, we normally use tennis and table tennis balls made of rubber. Similarly, balls for games like cricket, volleyball, basketball, and so on are also made of rubber. \n5. Thus, we can eliminate the options that feature games involving players moving: B: soccer fields, C: soccer games.\n6. The remaining options are: D: Central Park and E: pool table.\n7. Here we can eliminate D: Central Park because it clearly states that 'kids play with' a concrete ball.\n8. This means they can't be playing with it at a soccer game or in Central Park.\n9. Similarly, considering that this is a game for which the ball needs to move and bounce, playing with it on a pool table is also not a plausible answer.\n10. Thus, E: pool table is also eliminated, leaving us with the most likely answer choice: E: pool table. So the final answer is E.\n\nInput: When is the most important thing not to say?

{"text": "1  The question asks about the whereabouts of a special ficus.\n2. The given options can be narrowed down by eliminating redundant possibilities.\n3. A botanical garden is a garden or other facility where plants and other trees are grown in order to study the effects of environmental conditions and for conservation purposes.\n4. Therefore, a special ficus would not be found in a botanical garden since that is where it is grown and studied, not where it is found.\n5. A doctor's office is a facility or building where patients consult doctors or medical practitioners for consulting services.\n6. Special ficus is a plant so it would not be found in this context.\n7. A sea is a body of salt water covering over 70% of the surface of the Earth.\n8. Special ficus cannot be found in this setting due to the unsuitable environment.\n9. A public place is where members of the public are allowed to gather.\n10. Since special ficus is a plant and public places provide a natural and suitable environment for plants, there cannot be a special ficus there.\n11.

The term 'bagels' in the question can either refer to the specific type of bread or food item, or the act of carrying bagels or other food items, i.e., being 'bagel-ing'.\n3.) If 'bagel' refers to a specific food item, the question would likely refer to people like rich people and not the other way around.\n4.) If the term 'bagel' does not necessarily refer to a specific food item but is only a term to denote an action or activity, then, we have to consider the possible actions that people rich can do.\n5.) Of the options available, the most commonly associated act with 'bagels' is the act of selling or carrying/transferring bagels.\n6.) Rich people are likely to enjoy the action of selling (as they are already wealthy) or the transferring/carrying of bagels (as they can afford them).\n7.)

{"text": "1 The question asks where one would get a bass clarinet for a home setting.\n2. Looking at the context of the question, we can assume that bass clarinet in question here is not for a professional musician.\n3. To assume this, we can consider that the music store and opera house would mostly be for professional musicians.\n4. However, for the school band as well as music stores, there would be clarinets available for both professional and amatueur musicians.\n5. For amateur musicians, the best option for learning about clarinets and taking one home would be through school bands and music stores.\n6.

Choices: 12. The question describes reading a book about a purple pillow in a library.\n2. You can expect to see the books stacked and organized in a way that is similar to the way a library would be kept.\n3. The library would typically have shelves full of books that are crammed together, like a cram.\n4.

Choices:  A1. This sentence can be explained saying a person doesn't like to buy something after they saw it in a store\n2.

{"text": "1.The question asks us where we might have cake with our ice cream.\n2. We know that cake and ice cream are both made from cream, so they are served together.\n3. But we are confused because some words are misspelled as \"cark\" and \"ice cram\".\n4. These spellings refer to cars and cars are not cream.\n5. This makes it clear that the misspelled words are cake and ice creme.\n6. Therefore, we would have cake with our \"iceme\" at a \"kaky\".\n7. Looking at the context and eliminating all the other options, A: \"a party\" is the best answer.\n8. A party is where iceme with be served, so we would have our \"iceme\" with the \"kaky\" frozen cake at a \"kakye\", a party.\n9.

Choices: A: stood up B: died C: sat down D: started talking E: taken a nap\nOutput: 1, 2. This question is about a father and a daughter and the daughter invites her father to her graduation.\n3. Her father is confused and does not know what to do, so she tells him to wait in his favorite seat.\n4. However, when he arrives there, he finds that the seat is now occupied by someone else.\n5. This scenario might lead him to do any number of things, such as getting angry or asking the neighbor to help him.\n6. We can infer that the correct answer requires a verb and a passive voice.\n7. Since \"A: stood up\" and \"E: taken a nap\" are already active, they are eliminated.\n8. There is no point from either \"C: sat down\" or \"D: started talking\" where the father could have \"taken an action\", thus  they are also eliminated.\n9. This leaves us with \"B: died\" and \"E: took a nap\".\n10. But in actuality, the father did not die nor take a nap, instead, the action of \"standing up\" has already happened.\n11.

{"text": "1 The question makes it clear that a person is in a coastal, Gulf State.\n2. The fox is seen and must thus be somewhere close by.\n3. The gulf states are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and the coasts of some states are not named and thus, are not given the option of mountain.\n4. The states left are Alabama, Louisiana, and South Carolina.\n5. Though they share rivers, the most important river that runs through gulf states is the Mississippi River, which runs through all these states except Louisiana.\n6. This leaves South Carolina and Alabama as the places where one would be likely to see a fox.\n7. Out of these, the best option that fits \"coastal, Gulf State\" is 'South Carolina'.\n8. Louisiana has \"Louisiana\" in the name and thus cannot be a Gulf State, which leaves the answer as, \"South Carolina\".\nSo the final answer to this question is D: alabama\n\nInput:Which of the following countries do not have a prime minister? Choices:  Australia, Germany, Netherlands, U.K. E: Luxembourg\nOutput: 1: Looking at the question as whole, it is clear that the answer that will not have a prime minister will be of a country where there is no other option than 'prime minister.'\n2. Among the options, the only one that doesn't have 'prime minister' as the top-ranked person, and only has the option of a president is \"Luxembourg.\"\n3. But Luxembourg does not have the option of \"prime minister\" because it is a country that is ruled by a Grand Duke.\n4.

Luxembourg is not Australia, Germany, or Netherlands.\nSo the final option that does not have a prime minister is D: Luxembourg\n\nInput:What is the opposite of a supercalifragilisticex-pealidocious?

{"text": "1.The question asks where a yard may be tiny and we understand that such description would apply to a yard that is tiny.\n2.The options presented are all correct in their general sense, as farmland has a large area that is used for farming, the neighborhood is a residential area which would be small in size, city has an extensive area with many people living together in it, hence a tiny one may imply a small part of it, the property is an area that belongs to someone and the same way could be used for a description of a small parcel, subdivision is a division or part of an area\n3. However, there could be a particular situation which can be implied if the question was a one liner, instead of this description\n4. Like many houses in a neighborhood have a small front yard\n5. So if the question was like this there can be a particular situation or instance in which small yard happens, in which the yard area can be tiny, in such a situation a tiny yard refers to that space in the house that is outside and can be used to plant some plants or grass\n6. Therefore, from this particular way the usage of the yard, the smallest space in an area is that of a big house or a building, so the property referred to here would be a yard that is smaller than the biggest space referred to\n7. So therefore, the correct choice to be made is D: property\nSo the final answer in question \n\nInput: I couldn\u2019t figure out what was making that awful noise in my car.

However, the question does not specifically ask about car maintenance, it asks about determining the source, which may include the engine part\n4.

{"text": "1.) The question states that if the event was truly celebratory, how would it be described?\n2.) The question does not specify if the celebration is either planned or spontaneous, and thus, we must assume both.\n3.) The question also does not provide any information regarding the number of individuals involved in the celebration, and so we must assume that all individuals celebrating would be described as celebrating the occasion.\n4.) This implies that, if the occasion was celebratory:\n5.) Those involved would be described as happy or having fun or enjoying themselves.\n6.) The choice E: Enjoyment is the best choice in this case.\n7.) There may be a possibility that those involved in the celebration are described as drinking or dancing or intimate, but those descriptions do not encompass the entire event and the entire event cannot be summarized into one simple word.\nSo the final answe is E: enjoyment \n\nInput: If it was a difficult time, why did she have so much joy? Choices:  - A: Because she was with family and friends B: Because she was happy C: Because people appreciated her music  D: Because she was young E: Because she had no worries\nOutput: 1) The question asks why the woman would have so much joy while it was a difficult time for her.\n2) It is clear that the woman was very happy to receive praise from her listeners but she was also saddened by this praise because she knew nothing had changed and she was not able to repay the kindness by improving her talent.\n3) Therefore we can rule out the first three options and the last one which has already been rejected, as all of them imply that the reason why she is so happy is because of the praise she receives and it is not very difficult to infer that receiving praise for a difficult talent is very difficult for someone to feel happy about.\n4) However we cannot reject'she had no worries'.\n5) We can infer that the woman had no worries, because she received the same treatment and did not bother over and over again which is what her concern would have been if she had worries and we conclude that'she was with family and friends' would be the best choice.\nSo the final answers are:'she was with family friends' \n\n## Output: Question:How did", "answer": "D: happiness"}

{"text": "1..The question asks why would professionals playing sports be unable to compete.\n2. We know that professionals could not compete if they are injured, are feeling ill, or unable to participate in the game for other reasons.\n3. Sweating or rain would not prevent a professional player from engaging in a practice or game session.\n4. If a professional player becomes overheated during a practice or a game and stops performing, the session will not be considered a competition.\n5.

Next, the remaining options make more sense in the context of 'But I had a cripp-ling fear of going where'.\n4. We understand that if there was something we feared going, we would be 'comfortable' in our house rather than in the place we feared.\n5. A 'crippling fear', therefore, might be of a place from which we have been kept away from.\n6. Moreover, 'apartment', 'outside', and 'neighborhood', and the most straightforward options and least likely places to experience such a 'crippling fear'.\n7.

In the second part of the question,  we need to consider both the options that require change as well as the ones that do not.\n3. In this respect, we can eliminate options B: Do push ups and C: Do sit ups which change something that was initially already in the person.\n4. With these two options eliminated, we look solely at the options that involve change.\n5. However, of the options remaining, the need to modify oneself does not seem a necessary component as it requires a change that is out of control.\n6. Moreover the options related to food, sleep and worry require one to have a certain level of control over oneself, which may not be required for the solutions.\n7.

This means we must eliminate D: \"cupboard\" as contributions can either be collected or contributed and \"cupboard\" does not directly refer to the collection of contributions.\n7.) Similarly, \"refrigerator\" or \"cellar\" make sense in the context, but the question states \"contributions\" so we need to eliminate these as well.\n8.) Finally we're left with A: \"shelf\" and E: \"grocery store\"\n9.) We see that contributors are going to take the donations to the nearby grocery stores.\n10.) We are told that the grocery stores need to have all the canned foods so that the donors can pick them up.\n11.) There is no mention of any other places, and the phrase \"grocery store\", with the possessive pronoun \"their,\" shows the singularity of this option.\n12.) The question is asking about where the speaker went, so the \"grocery store they went to\" must be grocery store \"they went\" to.\n13.)

This is a simple case of \"correlation does not equal causation.\" Just because you've taken emergancy training does not necessarily mean that everytime you're in an \"emergency situation\" you know what to do. Likewise, just because you've been in an emergency situation before does not mean that you know what to do \"every time you're in a emergency situation.\" 2.)

Choices:  G: I'm building a cake  H: I'm making a cake  J: I'm topping a cake  K: I'm mixing a cake  T: I'm storing them away  M: I'm eating them with friends\nOutput: 1.\u2019vegetables\u2019 is what mr cheesecakerequired to cook.\n2. He has cooked many vegetable meals, such as mashed potatoes, tomato soup and vegetable lasagna.\n3. Therefore, cooking vegetables is what Mr cheesecake is good at.\n4. Mr cheesecakeis not a vegetarian, so he does not prefer vegetables.\n5. 'going with all these vegetables' should mean what Mr cheesecakeshould do with these vegetables.\n6. If Mr cheesecakewere someone who likes to cook a lot, he would always have lots vegetables.\n7. When he bought groceries,  He probably bought tons of vegetables too (e.g. cabbages and carrots. vegetables like tomato sauce).\n8. Therefore,  he should be storing them away to make vegetable cakes.\n9. But, he is not making vegetable cakes. Instead, he is building a cake.\n10. So, A: \u2018I\u2019m building a cake\u2019 is the possible answer.\nSo the answer is: A: I\u2019m building a cak\n\nInput: What is the name of the island that is very close to france?

{"text": "1: Looking at the given options, it's clear that \"The helm\" is something you don't wear on your head.\n2. The question specifically mentions \"it moves the masts,\" indicating it's related to sailing.\n3. Sailing vessels typically consist of many large vertical structures (masts) that move with each turn of the helm.\n4. Therefore, the helm is likely the part of the ship that moves the masts.\n5. Looking at the given options again, it seems that only B: \"paddleboat\" and E: \"tugboat\" are clearly sailing vessels.\n6. Therefore, it's unlikely that a tugboat or a paddleboat will be mentioned, leaving us with D: \"ship\" as the only possible answer choice.\nSo the final option would be D: ship\n\nInput: The 2-by-4 studs I'm using to secure the windows and the door are made out of steel. However, their function is what? Choices: Avoid B Endure C Restrain D Reinforce E Suppress\nOutput: 1) Here the question seeks the function of steel studs.\n2) Looking through different options, the term 'Avoid' can be excluded as their function is not to secure the windows and/or the door.\n3) 'Endure' and 'Restrain' are very close words and can be used interchangeably. This is not an instance that would require them to be distinct as they would have almost the same meaning(s).\n4) Likewise, 'Reinforce' and 'D' (Reinforce) both mean to strengthen. Thus, using'suppress' would do the exact opposite.\n5) Therefore, the sentence would become 'The studs are made out of steel; however, their function is to' and thus 'Reinforce' would have been chosen(if correct).\n6) The only remaining option is the 'C: Restrain'.\n7) Thus, the correct answer would be 'Reinforce'.\nSo the final answer would be D: Reinforce\n\nInput: An ex-con has nothing in common with a convicted felon.

{"text": "1 and 2. The question asks us about the feeling experienced by the woman.\n3. Options A and B are given as synonyms of word'misery\u2019, but'misery\u2019 could be an appropriate way of describing the state of someone who suffers for a long duration (i.e. misery lasts longer compared to'sadness', 'bad time','sorrow', and 'play time'),\n4. whereas'sadness' describes the feeling of being upset or feeling low because of something or someone's absence, as given in the phrase 'the woman experienced great joy... despite that this was a...sadness'.\n5. Thus it is clear that'sadness' refers to the woman's feeling of depression, and not to the event or situation itself.\n6. Options C and D are given as synonym for word'sadness' because they contain the word'sad'.\n7. However, 'bad time' does not aptly describe the woman's feelings, as it is associated with being in trouble, misfortune or failure, for instance if a man misses a job interview, or a child fails to pass an exam etc.\n8. Similarly,'sorrow' refers to feeling dejected, sad and regretful.  'Sorrow' is not appropriate as the phrase states that she had 'great joy'.\n9. Finally, 'play time' is not appropriate as it suggests pleasure or happiness, which in the given situation would be misleading.\n10. Thus, the best answer would be E: \"play time\".\nSo the final answer: \"play time\".", "answer": "C: bad time"}

{"text": "1.`The question talks about the possible scenarios our mind can go through in the absence of consciousness and control.\n2. Here the options suggested are: snoring, talking in their sleep, getting cold, and maybe dreaming.\n3. Since these are the scenarios that are most common among people and also possible to happen under the absence of conscious control, these would be the possible answers.\n4. Among these, the obvious choice is A: snoring, as it is the most frequent occurrence among adults.\n5. Snoring is a noisy sound that emanates from the breathing during sleep. Snoring occurs when the flow of air from the throat is blocked by soft tissues, preventing the air from flowing adequately. Thus the air is pushed out causing vibrations in the oral cavity which produce the sound typically known as snoring.\n6. \"Talking in their sleep\" is also a possibility, but is less common and not as prominent as snoring.\n7. So for the most plausible answer, the correct one is A: snoring.\nSo the final is A: snoring\n\nInput: If your friend is trying to sell you a used car, you should what? Choices: A: negotiate.

Therefore, the only applicable and logically sound option is the one that states you should offer the friend", "answer": "E: might dream"}

A male cow is known as a bull, so an \u201cheifer\u201d is therefore the opposite of a bull.\n4. It is likely that the answer will mention a specific location, however, since the question is trying to ask about what a person can do with their heifer, the person would probably want to take the cow somewhere it is safe to go, without mentioning a specific location like Texas or New Hampshire.\n5. However there may be some reference to what the person does with the cow, therefore farm field is a good suggestion as the cow will be raised there. The use of \"might\" also implies that there can be multiple correct answers, however because \"new hampshire\" was eliminated first, we can be sure that \"new hampshire'' is not correct.\n6. Therefore, D: farm field is the best and correct answer to the question.\nSo the final answers are D: farm field and B: dairy farm\n\nInput: A sneaker with a metal toe, designed by a shoemaker from what?

{"text": "1 The question asks where a captive monkey would be found.\n1. We understand that a monkey is an animal that is typically wild and not usually captive.\n2. But captivity is frequently used in science due to its practicality and ease of control. \n3. Therefore, when scientists capture wild monkeys, they are likely to do so in a location where they are easy to find and capture, such as a zoo.\n4. Zoo monkeys are commonly found in zoological gardens, which are also commonly known as zoos or animal parks.\n5. This makes option D zoological gardens the most suitable choice as it corresponds to the context of scientists capturing wild monkeys and placing them in cages for study.\nSo the final result should be D: zoological gardems.\n\nInput: How do the names of the Great Lakes compare with other U.S. lakes?

The question asks how the Great Lakes compare to other lakes in terms of their names.\n2. We are not provided any context as to how the Great Lakes are named, so the only way we can understand how they compare to other lakes is by looking at their names.\n3. If we look at individual lake names, we can see that the Great Lakes have the longest names, which makes option A 'Longer name' the most appropriate choice.\n4. A longer name usually suggests more information is included, indicating that there is more to the name than most other lakes.

{"text": "1.'Outgoing' is defined as someone who is naturally cheerful and friendly in nature.\n2. 'Seek', on the other hand, is typically linked with the idea of pursuing something or trying to acquire it.\n3. This indicates that when dealing with an outgoing person, it's important to know which specific qualities they're most likely seeking.\n4. The question provides us with a list of possible attributes that could apply to an outgoing person: experience, playfulness, a house, and beauty.\n5. To narrow down the possibilities, let's first eliminate the ones that are unlikely or don't apply to an outgoing individual.\n6. For an 'outgoing' person, gaining new experiences or being 'playful' would not typically be their main goals or goals they would seek to prioritize.\n7. Similarly, acquiring 'own house' or seeking 'beauty' are more likely goals sought by an individual who is more'reserved' or 'withdrawn.'\n8. Thus, we can eliminate A, B, D, and E answers from the list.\n9. Looking at the remaining options, we can conclude that an outgoing individual is more likely to seek either new experiences or playfulness.\n10. But both of these options can mean different things to different individuals, so it's necessary to narrow it down further.\n11. 'New experiences' can refer to everything from travel and adventure to exploring new ideas and learning new skills.\n12.

Choices:  January February March April May\nOutput: 1)The question states that the youngest of the Benneman siblings is two years old.\n2)We know that February is the second month of a year.\n3)It also refers to the siblings and it would be odd for one sibling to celebrate his/her birthday twice in one year.\n3)Therefore, the question asks about the month in which birthday of the youngest Brenneman sibling will be celebrated in the following years.\n4)Let us observe the given options:\n\nJanuary is the only option in which the birthday of the young Brenneman child should be celebrated at the end of the year.\n\nFebruary will not be appropriate for this due to the reference of Brenneman's siblings, we can deduct that this would be the second month in which all the siblings have the same age.\nAlso, when they turn two years in this month, then the youngest one will also turn two years.\n\nThus, option C) states that this one month will be for the siblings' birth month and birthday.\nMarch is still not appropriate for this as the end of the year will be when the youngest Brennemman siblings will have their birthday.\nAlso, this month is not known for the birthdate of any of celebrity or well-known personalities.\n4)Therefore, A) The youngest Brennemann sibling will be celebrating his birthday in March.\n\nThus answer is A:March", "answer": "C: hockey game"}
{"text": "1) It was mentioned that a government would be seeking something over it's people.\n2. From the context, it's likely that whatever the government would be seeking would be related to the people that it governs, or those that the country is made up of.\n3. It is usually the government that seeks to control, govern, rule, or over the people, or the country.\n4. This statement is generally true since governments have laws, rules, or regulations governing people from within or the world outside the country.\n5. Governments want to control or regulate what other people do in a country or outside it.\n6. However the given options, the two options which could make sense from context are, country and sun.\n7. Government wants to control what goes on within the country and it is the citizens that resides in it, thus B: country\n8. In the same way the government will want to control or regulations from outside the country but from within the country because it is the citizens and it's the country that it resides within.\n9.

{"text": "1.) The question asks us to select the correct alternative to fill in the blank.\n2.) The blank is \"to provide\", which refers to the act or action of supplying someone with something.\n3.) \"You are seeking to provide (something) \u2026\" suggests that you are looking for some specific \"thing\" for which you can fulfill its purpose of supplying \"you\" with something you need.\n4.) There is an ambiguity whether you are looking for the job or application, but this ambiguity is cleared with the given option D.\n4.) This is because the word \"offer\" can be interpreted in two ways: 1. The term \"offer\" is used in its literal sense to mean \"an act of offering something (a job) to someone\". 2. The term \"of hope\" can be used in a figurative sense to mean \"providing a means of fulfilling one's dreams or aspirations (a job)\". The figurative sense of \"offering hope\" gives the sense of fulfillment that is closer to the question asking for something in which you can provide yourself with something.\n5.) Accordingly, we can say that D is the best option here since it provides this sense of fulfillment by its very definition.\n6.) This means that our final answer is D: \"offer\".\nSo the final answer us D: offer\n\nInput: A large corporation announced they had chosen what for their advertising campaigns? Choices: 1.

However it is important to carefully analyze the choices that remain- both A and B refer to professions that may involve frequent traveling as a part of their job- and may lead one to believe that an accountant or a musician may be more likely to have car usage on a regular basis. However these references are too broad and can include many people whose profession or hobby does not involve frequent travel, and therefore would not lead to car ownership and regular usage..\n4. We can thus eliminate these two options A and B and arrive at the correct answer choice as C: farmer.\nSo the final correct answer to the question is: C: farmer\n\nInput: Which of these sports is played on a court and involves both teams attacking", "answer": "D: step forward"}

Choices: A. Humans living in caves B. Aliens from deep space C. The first humans to reach an ocean D. Gigantic robots from a galaxy far far away E. A human invention that will one day be perfected\nOutput: 11. It can be deduced that the question is asking about the pop-culture association for \u2018troglodyte\u2019.\n12. From the other choices, only A, B, D and E refer to human inventions.\n13. From the choices, A: \u2018Humans living in caves\u2019 is an incorrect answer because troglodyte refers to humans living in caves.\n14. Similarly, B: \u2018Aliens from deep space\u2019 is an incorrect answer.\n15. B can be considered a synonym of \u2018Aliens\u2019 but the word \u2018troglodyt\u2019 doesn\u2019t exactly refer to Aliens or Alien cultures.\n16. Therefore, E: \u2018A human invention that will be perfected one day\u2019 is a fitting answer because the meaning of the word \u2018troglyd\u2019 refers to people who lived in the caves.\nSo the correct option is E: A human invention that could one day be completed.", "answer": "D: big city"}
{"text": "1.'It had a beach with\u2026' implies that the location under discussion has something like a beach.\n2. However, it further says 'this was a hot spot all locals enjoyed on..' suggesting the place was not meant for the locals only but also for visitors.\n3. Therefore, what are the options for 'was' that are suitable according to this context?\n4. The first two options'swimming pool' and 'pond' are more suited for locals as they mention locality or place, but not enough to refer to tourists.\n5. The third and fourth options 'lake' and 'bathe in' are a bit ambiguous as they may refer to bodies of waters without differentiating between man-made and natural bodies, but could also not refer to a swimming pool as it states it is 'the locals' and not 'the children' that like to use the pool.\n6. Thus, considering the entire context, we need an option that will refer to a sea or ocean but not a swimming pool.\n7. Therefore, 'oceans' and 'hot spots' are not suitable as they are not suitable descriptors of the ocean and they are also vague in describing what the location is.\n8. Likewise, 'children' is an ambiguous descriptor and the verb 'bathing in'  is not sufficient to describe the activity the children do.\n9. However, 'ocean' and 'was' are quite common descriptors of the ocean. So, we consider E: ocean and 'ocean' as the most fit answer.\nSo the answer is E: ocean", "answer": "C: lake"}
{"text": "1.* The question asks us where a person would go to look at zedras.\n2. As per the context given, a person might go to a zoo(zoological/science museum), a hospital or a museum.\n3. But a hospital would not make sense since a zoo would have better conditions for a zebra.\n4. A desk is not relevant to this context.\n5. A zoo has multiple sections where guests can see different animals, therefore it might be called a \u201czoo\u201d if it only has one section.\n6. Similarly a museum might have sections called zoology, wildlife or animal studies which might or might not have the specific section called \u201czoo\u201d,\n7. While a museum has multiple sections, it wouldn't have wild animals in the first place, so it is out of question.\n8. Therefore the remaining option is B: zoo which is the correct answer\nSo the final answer 2 is A: zoo\n\nInput:I'm not just telling you this to boast. My son's got a pretty good head for ___.

Here the given options are mathematics, sports, politics, business or money.\n3. I\u2019m not just telling you ___ is the most suitable option that can be inferred from the context of the conversation.\n4. It is known that if the speaker doesn\u2019t have a good head for maths then his son will likely have a good head or strong ability for maths.\n5. If the speaker is a politician then politics can be a preferred ability for that person.\n6. Money should not be preferable as the question was about something that can be improved.\n7. So all other options can be eliminated and so the most suitable option is C: mathematics.\nSo the final choice is C: mathematics\n\nInput: She had to go out for her groceries and was in danger of running out of what?

She is anxious that she will \u201cdo something\u201d because this is what the next sentence explains.\n3. \"Do something\" is the context clues given, \"not know enough\" does not make sense.\n4. \"Do badly\" does not make sense because that means she will do something badly.\n5. \"Do not do it\" does not make sense, though we have to consider for a moment that it could be \"know enough\".\n6. As such, \"do something\" is also the correct answer but with the additional context that suggests that she is worried that she will do something wrong at the job interview.\nSo the final D: do something\n\nInput: You may run from it, but eventually you have to deal with what? Choices: B: an illness C: a loan D: the economy E: yourself\nOutput: 2. We can reasonably assume that since the subject \"you\" are the one running from something.\n3. Therefore, that running away from something suggests they are hiding or ignoring something.\n4. The \"you\" would eventually have to face their actions.\n5. This is because there is always a time when people come to terms with their actions.\n6. The other option of \"You\" could be to \"You\" meaning the writer since they write to themselves and no one else.\n7.

The 'Charming' and 'Space Shuttle' options might also be valid but lack specific details and clarification.\n6. The 'Earth' option is too vague and ambiguous.\n7. From the remaining options, we can infer that the place must be an area in which crowds congregate on a regular basis and where many people would gather to have a general experience.\n8. This can be interpreted as a public place, frequented by many people on a regular basis.\n9. Thus, the 'Surface of the Earth' option, due to its specificity with the word'surface', becomes a suitable answer.\nSo the correct answer is E: surface of the earth", "answer": "D: train station"}

B: A city might be a suitable place to get your car repaired, but it is not necessarily a place that you would not want to send your car.\n7. C: A repair shop seems like a natural choice, as it is the most likely place where a person would get their car repaired.  It also makes sense to be wary of taking the car to a repair shop, implying a desire to avoid such a place.\n8.

We can assume that the given real estate agent is genuinely trying to gain her trust, hence we'll need to filter out the unsuitable options that aren't helpful to the real estate agent.\n4. The question seems to expect an answer related to charming, polite, or deceiving.\n5. These are unsuitable since we don't want to describe him as deceiving or unreliable, that may make us suspect his true motive (deceiving her of course).\n6. Similarly, a polite and charming person who is trying to get her trust shouldn't be dissuaded, so it would've been more helpful to describe the attributes of a person who convinces others to trust them.\n7. We realize that it's referring to the agent's character and not his sales ability.\n8. Moreover, we can eliminate the option D (exaggerate) since it doesn't seem suited for a characterization of a reliable person.\n9. Similarly, B (charming) may sound applicable but it would be hard to know what the agent's personality is like.\n10.

To understand the reason behind this loud sound, we need to consider the events or processes that take place during the rocket launching.\n4.

{"text": "1.The question asks about what would be considered a success in procreation.\n2. The options provided are not specific to procreation but rather define success or its connotation.\n3. Considering this, the idea of procreation is better understood from the perspective of having a child or giving birth.\n4. It is important to note that procreation is essentially a medical term and that it should be approached from a medical perspective.\n5. The options \"celebrate\", \"have party\", \"create success\", and \"reproduce\" can apply to anything or anyone who is not associated with procreation or childbirth per se.\n6. \"Hear crowd go mad\" would not define success in procreation but might rather signify a distraction or disruption with respect to the medical process.\n7. Therefore, \"create success\" and \"have party\" would be inappropriate for the context.\n8. This leaves the most suitable options as 'create success' and 'hear crowd go mad'.\n9. However, \"create success\" does not apply to the context because a successful procreation would be one in which the pregnancy is successfully carried out, leading to a birth and a full-term child.\n10. There can be several cases of failure in procreation, and creating \"success\" is not necessarily the best or the only idea of success.\n11. Therefore, from the context of procreation, the best definition of success would be one that leads to creating life rather than one that leads to the celebration of a healthy result.\n12. Considering this, we can eliminate option D: \"create success\" because it would indicate a person's happiness rather than the conception of a new live.\n13. Option E: \"reproduce\" is another option that can be eliminated since only \"create success\" signifies the medical process of procreation.\n14. Finally, since the question indicates a 'party' would be in progress, option B: \"hear crowd go mad\" is the most suitable answer.\nSo the correct answer is B: a party where everyone is going mad or crazy\n\nInput: The tapeworm lives in the stomach and intestines of a what?

However, considering the context of the question, it's clear that the term'listening vinyl' is a reference to 'audiophiles'.\n4. In other words, \"where is one likely to purchase audiophiles\"?\n5.

So,'where to purchase listening vinyl', should be in reference to 'where a person would find audiophiles'\n7. Audiophiles can be found in music shops and record stores that sell recorded music, so A: safeway could be a possible answer.\n8. However, A: safeway, is not the best answer because that refers to purchasing groceries and not audio supplies.\n9. Thus, from the given options C: record store and D: record store, D: record store, seems like the best answer as it clearly mentions'music shop' that sells items related to recorded music such as albums and discs, thus confirming the answer to be D: record store.\nSo the final\n\nInput: If not all the water in the lake evaporated, would the lake dry up? Choices:  No A: Yes B: Maybe\nOutput: 1: The lake would not dry up unless all the water in the water body evaporates.\n2. Evaporation happens when the water from the lake is heated to the point where its molecules are sufficiently energised and can escape to the atmosphere.\n3. If you leave a small puddle of water on the floor, it's not likely to dry up, even if all humidity evaporates. \n4: However, for water in a gigantic lake to dry up, it would require an enormous amount of water to evaporate, which can only happen if the sun and atmospheric conditions are perfect.\n5. Also, the lake will remain water for some weeks/months which can lead to the growth of algae in the water after some days.\n6. So to summarize, the answer to the question is B: Maybe.\nSo the final response is B: maybe\n\nInput:", "answer": "C: record store"}

The length of the bumper cars race is limited to just the length of a bumper car.  What does that have in common with your friend? Choices:  B: She is incompetent. C: Her favorite hobby is riding bikes. D: She has short legs. E: She is rich.\nOutput: 1: The question asks about the commmonality among certain things.\n2: It can not be that she is incompetent because the question only talks about length and does not talk about shortness.\n3: Also it can not be that she rides a bike because she does not have short legs but has to start by that line in a race which is also opposite of starting short.\n4: She could have both short legs and be rich, but then the question would be asking what she is capable of, which can be none of the three options.\n5: Riding a bike could come under the shortness mentioned, since a bike is supposed to be short but her legs are short and she starts the race by the short distance line.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: She is short.\n\nInput: The city council is having difficulty finding a new park manager.

{"text": "1.'Relax' and'simply' is an exaggeration which indicates a general statement.\n2. Relax is a generic term, which could mean anything, while 'opening' is a verbal object.\n3. 'Opening up' does not make any sense in the given context.\n4. 'Similarly' is vague since it doesn't specify the reason, while 'for example' does.\n5.

The question asks us what we can do with a 15V car heater if we have a 12v charger?\n2. We know from the options that any kind of charger is better than the given 12V charger.\n3. This is because the option of a 'large battery' has a battery capacity higher than 12V hence can't be recharged using a 12V char\n4.

This could lead to a feeling of satisfaction.\n5: The other options \"working out,\" \"get tired,\" \"falling down,\" and \"sore\" are inappropriate in the context.\n6: The option \"working out\" could imply the physical side effects of working out.\n7: The option \"get tired\" could suggest a feeling of exhaustion after running.\n8: However, this would be counter to the idea of satisfaction, as satisfaction is associated with a sense of fulfillment or achievement.\n9: Similarly, the option \"falling down\" seems to be out of place because running and falling down don't immediately seem to be related.\n10: Finally, the option \"sore,\" while generally associated with running, would imply a physical pain or discomfort, which could be uncomfortable or distracting, but not necessarily associated with the feeling of satisfaction.\n11: In conclusion, the most appropriate answer seems to be \"satisfaction.\" This feeling is commonly associated with running and working out and may be felt after a run.\nSo the final answers is E: satisfaction \n\nInput: Which of the following is a good title?

{"text": "1/ 2. The question asks about the most convenient place to be where a bus station may be found.\n3. This is a question about which location would be the most logical place and convenient to be around for someone looking to find a bus station since he wouldn't want to go far to reach one.\n4. Therefore, the first part of the question asks where is a good place to be that most likely contains a bus station.\n5. We are to think not about the bus station, but its surrounding, to find a convenient place for it to be.\n6. Maps are found in almost all offices or buildings since we may need to know our way around but they may not always be convenient if someone needs to find a bus station.\n7. Similarly, a street is considered by many to be highly convenient since most things can be found on a street.\n8. However, a road is not really necessary and might be distracting and inconvenient if one is trying specifically to locate and find a bus station. This may not be the most convenient place for a bus stop to be since it is a location where someone might be easily distracted.\n9. Finally, having a bus stop in or outside a city gives a false location advantage to other options since the final part of the question asks about a place that is convenient.\n10. It may seem logical to have a bus stop right in any of these locations because a city is a lot more convenient to go out to.\n11, But this doesn\u2019t match a conclusion that being in or close to a city is the most important thing to consider, since \"convenient\" in the context and question is about finding a location that is most suitable for being in.\n12. The final part of the question implies being near an office or school would be appropriate which are most likely located in a city which is where it may appear the most sensible to create one.\n13. Therefore, the bus stops are likely to only be created in schools and offices.\n14. But from a location perspective, an office or a school is not a super convenient place for a bus to be.\n15. Therefore, the correct location is a city centre.\n16. A city centre may be more convenient for a bus stop than an office or school.\n17. This is likely since most buses start from central locations.\nSo the final answers are D:", "answer": "D: city centre"}

'Because every dog in town loved them' refers to the mother's hatred for cake, not Jabber's.\n3. 'Because it was crumbly' means the mother disliked crumbly cakes, which goes against the context that the mother only hates Jabber\u2019s cake based on its name.\n4. Hence, the mother's hate for cake is unique to Jabber as no cake is unique or similar to \u2018Jabber\u2019.\n5. Looking at the remaining option, the context fits the idea of 'burning'.\n6.

The second clause states that he\u2019s never felt the urge to sneeze.\n3. The third clause asks who might sneeze in such an environment.\n4. The answer mentions the presence of others who might sneeZe, though not necessarily readers.\n5. The options given: 'F', is the best suited because 'a library' is the place.\n6. Considering the context, 'F' is the most fitting since it's the only option that gives a reason for why you might hear a sneezEin a library, rather than just mentioning where it could happen.\n7. That is in a library, it's easy to see who's speaking, therefore, the 'F' is the correct choice because you might hear a sNeeze in a liBRary because it's hard.\nSo the final choice is F: it's hard to read people here.\n\nInput: If a cucumber grows straight without becoming wavy, it will be a what?

{"text": "1: The question asks where we should hold a reception with many people.\n2. It\u2019s important to hold a reception in a place that ensures smooth and orderly flow of the event.\n3. Receptions can either be held indoors or outdoors, but in this case, we'd have to focus on places where having a reception indoor can be advantageous because of certain factors.\n4. Restaurants or country clubs, both of which are located indoors with the possibility of being covered, would be a bad choice because of how many people would be present and making their way around the space.\n5. If the space is crowded and without defined entry and exit points, there's a possibility of an unsavoury and chaotic reception that might be embarrassing or inconvenient to all involved.\n6. Besides, having a reception at a restaurant is an unnecessary expense unless we're looking to spend money to spoil something, which doesn't seem to be the case.\n7. A grand casino is even worse, as it's unlikely to be a safe area for such a large crowd and would also be expensive.\n8. That leaves three options: large room, lobby, and hotel.\n9.

The question asks about 451 which was previously found to be a good approximation to five and a half.\n2. We know that 451 is an approximation of five and a half, so the options A and C have been eliminated.\n3. It might seem that 451 can be a good approximation of either three and a quarter or one and one-fifht, but this is not the scenario.\n4. It is indeed possible that 451 could be considered a good approximation to one and one-fiftb; however, this option is inconsistent with previously defined term \"good approximation\" that implies \"close to the number we were looking for \", the definition of 451 does not satisfy this.\n5.

This eliminates option B which states that 451 would be equal to three and a quarter.\n8.

Based on this definition, we can eliminate two of the options:\n5.) \"bar\", because we do not buy wine by the glass in bars.\n6.) \"basement\", because it would not be our primary location to buy a normal-sized glass of wine.\n7.) \"church\", for the same reason of not being our primary location to buy normal-sized glasses of wine.\n8.) \"art show\" would be highly unlikely, unless the event is specifically known for selling wine.\n9.) We are ultimately left with two possible choices: \"art show\" and \"basement\".\n10.) But the definition of a normal-sized, pre-measured glass of wine is narrowed down to only basement, as basements provide the perfect backdrop for pre-measured wine.\n11.)

The given options: 'They want a bidder' is incorrect because if there were interested parties, the seller would already have been asked about the price and terms.\n4.

{"text": "1: This question focuses on an accountant who frequently uses a calculator.\n2: Although it is possible to use a calculator at home or in the office, the wording of the question \"kept\" implies that the accountant must have multiple devices in order to account for frequent use.\n3: The options provided are the places where the individual may keep a calculator.\n4: The word \"home\" implies that the account can use a calculator at a convenient location such as the desk or on the table.\n5: The word \"office\" suggests the accountant may store the device at the work desk because they work from the business office, and thus a calculator could be located closer to the office.\n6: The word \"wristwatch\" refers to a compact and portable device that would fit snugly into the palm and may be referred to as a \"portable calculator.\"\n7: Lastly, the location of \"city hall\" refers to the community where the accountant lives and works which makes the accounting more convenient.\n8: Thus, the word \"city hall\" can be eliminated and we are left with the best option of \"desk drawer.\"\n9: In conclusion, the \"desk drawer\" is the best answer.\nSo the finally answer is A: desk drawers since the question specifically states about keeping calculator in your \"home and at the office\".

{"text": "1: The question asks what it feels like to wake up after a great rest.\n2. A \"great rest\" implies a relaxing and restful night's sleep, which is typically followed by feeling \"wakeful\" in the morning.\n3. \"Wakefulness\" implies feeling alert and aware and may be accompanied by hunger or an urge to \"be in motion,\" but these are not the only symptoms of feeling \"awake\" after a good rest.\n4. The answer would only be \"active\" or \"in motion\" if waking from a great rest left the person physically or mentally stressed and restless, implying they need to do something in that condition.\n5. So all mentioned answers are inappropriate.\n6. Only \"active\" is an appropriate reply because it is a response that indicates that the person slept well and is now ready to do something.\n7. \"Lay down\" is also an accurate result, since it indicates that the person might be tired and ready to relax, as they are \"laying down.\"\nSo the final answer should include both \"active\" and \"down\" since only both the answers are the correct answer\n\nInput: Where may someone experience nausea or an upset stomach?

{"text": "10. The question asks about the ending relationship status between a lawyer, who is likely to be ending the marriage of the client in a divorce case, and the client.\n2.

A divorce between a husband and wife would mean that they get divorced and separate from each other.\n5. A divorce between friends would mean that they divorce and stop being friends.\n6. A divorce between enemies could mean that they would end their hostility towards each other.\n7. Divorcing two people or getting divorced doesn't make much sense since it implies an identity transformation.\n8. The client therefore seeks to end her marriage in a divorce to her husband and not any other relationship.\n9.

The most appropriate answers here would be c: power cut and d: hibernation.\n3. Choice A: mobile death is an inappropriate choice since shutdown and death of a device are very different.\n4.

Choice D: hibernation is not equivalent to sudden power outage leading to device shutdown.\n7. Choice E: sleep mode is an option not directly referring to power cut or device shutdown.\n8.

This answer does not make sense and is out of context with the question.\n\nb) Species : Species is a broad category that includes all animals that share similar characteristics. This answer does not match the context of the question, which refers specifically to the heart of the person.\n\nc) Artichoke : Artichokes typically do not have hearts, so this answer is not relevant.\n\nd) All mammals : All mammals share similar characteristics and often do have hearts, but this answer is too broad and misses the point of the question.\n\ne) Live animal : Live animals, such as dogs and cats, often display signs of care and affection towards their owners, but again, this answer is too broad.\n\n4) After eliminating the above choices, it can be seen that \"all mammals\" is the only answer that does make sense and fits the context of the question.\n5) Mammals, which includes humans among other animals, possess complex emotional states and are known for their care and affection towards their young.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer is E: all mammals.\nSo the final  answer is E : all mammals\n\nInput: For which sport is a ball used while its name is a synonym of the name for the ball?

The options given are: \"feel cold\", \"feel pressure\", \"feel bumpy\", \"itches\", and \"feels clammy.\" Let us analyze these options one by one: - \"Feeling cold\" - While this is possible, it would imply that the skin was also exposed to air, implying it was not covered. - \"Feeling pressure\" - Again, possible, but not suitable here as the skin was \"pinched in\" something. - \"Feeling bumpy\" - This is not a physical sensation experienced by skin. - \"Itches\" - It appears as a synonym of \"feel clammy\". - \"Feels clammy\" - Clamminess is usually a physical sensation felt when one is sweating or has a wet, clammy skin. Skin that has been pinched together in something may experience clamminess or dampness. - As the options \"feels clamminess\" or \"feels bumpy\" are relevant to the context of the question, and eliminate all other options, it can be inferred that the correct option is E: feels clammy.\nSo the final option is E: feels  the clamminess\n\nInput: You could call a strawberry that's very ripe and juicy ______.

Tabby cats are generally friendly and enjoy human interactions, so they will likely feel happiest in a domestic environment, such as their home.\n4. This eliminates options B: home, C: alley and D: lap as it would not be very natural or practical to be sitting in a lap or a narrow alleyway.\n5. As for option A: box, this would not be a very preferred habitat for a domesticated cat, as they are accustomed to human interaction and love to roam the house freely.\n6.

Based on the context of the question, it cannot be literal. So, the only choice that is left is metaphorically'sleep' or literally'sleep'.\n6: Similarly, let us go through B, C and D: A: 'admiration' is an emotion or feeling of deep respect, gratitude or appreciation towards someone or something. If so, since the question says 'all the crowds will stand', then it would be logical that the new play is so remarkable that all the crowds are expressing their admiration to the play. So this answer also cannot be the correct answer.\n7: C: This is referring to the act of clapping to express appreciation, gratitude etc. Since the question uses the word 'experience', the answer choice cannot be C (cannot be clapping).\n8: Now we are left with D: experience. This means to feel something, experience something. The word experience itself says that this includes feeling, so the answer choice is narrowed down to experience D.\n9: Then we see that the remaining answer choices are'make reservations' and'sleep'.\n10: So if everyone made reservations for the play, it means everyone wants to go and watch the play and hence D is eliminated. If D was right, then there's no way the play could be overbooked in such a way that people will be standing and cannot reserve their seats.

A mail box is an enclosed structure where letters are collected and dropped after delivery. It is typically secured and kept inside the home or business.\n4. This leaves us with the remaining three, namely, suit case, front  door, and post office.\n5. Letter post boxes are secure containers which are usually kept inside a home or building.\n6. The front door is a public entrance to a single family home or an apartment where visitors enter or leave. In case of apartment, the front door is usually managed by the building\u2019s concierge.\n6. Finally, post offices are public institutions where mail and parcels can be collected and sent.

The given answers are A: do dream, B: fiddle, C: see film, D: watch film and E: work.\n3. We can eliminate answer A from choosing two options that have the meaning 'to dream', meaning the question is too specific.\n4. We then know that no two options have the same meaning, so we need to identify the meaning of the phrase 'to fidget' or 'fidget' and the meaning of 'telling' as well as 'to see'.\n5. From Merriam-Webster dictionary, we find that fiddling with thumbs means to 'play with one's thumbs\" and means \"to occupy oneself with trifling acts; to waste time idly\".\n6. Similarly, from dictionary.com, we find that another meaning of fidget is \"to work without purpose or with restless inefficiency\".\n7. By process of elimination, we can then correctly answer that to fidget means to do something which has no actual purpose (idle work/play), to work with no actual purpose or efficiency, and is defined as 'to waste time'.\n8. We can now compare this with 'telling' which is defined as 'to convey information orally' or 'to communicate information'.\n9. From these definitions, we can eliminate 'watch film' from the answer choices as 'watching film' involves conveying information.\n10. We can also eliminate'seeing new' as it is defined in a slightly different manner which means 'to look at something for the first time'.\n11. We can now compare the definition of 'to tell' and the definition of 'to fidget' and find that the former means to 'communicate information orally' and the latter means to 'waste time idly' (e.g., 'playing with thumbs').\n12. By comparing these, we can correctly answer that an appropriate choice can be 'to speak'.\nSo the final answer in case B is C: speak\n\nInput: If your car is 100,000 miles old, you will need to have it checked regularly, such as what?

The word Market itself refers to the buying and selling which can be done through auctions or fixed price merchandising.\n3. There are different types of markets with names given such as fresh produce markets, craft markets, meat markets, and antique markets.\n4 These physical markets provide a physical environment for the exchange of goods/commodities such as buying clothes, fruits, vegetables, crafts, etc.  However, if the exchange was taking place from home, then that would be considered online shopping.\n5.

{"text": "1.`The question seeks to determine where a bassoon could be played in an unpleasant fashion.\n2. We know that a bassoon is a common type of woodwind instrument.\n3. Woodwind instruments are generally classified into two categories: reed and brass instruments.\n4. Brass instruments, such as horns or trumpets, are usually played by blowing air through a mouthpiece.\n5. Reed instruments, however, are sounded by making the player's lips vibrate.\n6. The reed of a bassoon consists of a double reed, which is similar to that found in an oboe.\n7. The bassoon produces a rich, deep tone and has a unique timbre that can only be mastered by a skilled player.\n8. A bassoon might be played in an unskilled way in an academic setting.\n9. An 'unpleasant' bassoon sound would be typical for a high school band, a school ensemble group of students learning music or playing in the school's show choir etc.\n10. A bassoon would be played in an unenjoyable way in a professional symphony orchestra.\n11. In these cases, a bassoon would be played by a seasoned professional who would know how to play and how to sound the instrument.\n12. Contrary to the above, a bassoon would most likely be played in an unacceptable or unenchanting way.\n13. The latter phrase is an adjective used to describe something or someone that may be good but not exactly perfect or ideal.\n14. In this context, 'unacceptable' is the opposite of that which is acceptable or appropriate, and would be used to refer to a bassoon player who is unprofessional.\n15. Therefore, considering all the above, the most appropriate location for a bassoon player to play it poorly would be an academic or secondary school, as it would be unacceptable in a professional symphony.\n16. As a result, the correct answer is \"A orchestra.\"\nSo the final answer to the question is A: orchestra\n\nInput: What is a 'flavor' of a particular color?

{"text": "1.) The question asks where a printer could be used by thousands of users.\n\n2. A printer is a computer peripheral device that is typically used in offices and home offices for the purpose of printing data and documents.\n3. Due to the large number of people working in an office space, the printers are usually situated in the office itself to make access easier.\n4. Ones printer may be shared among multiple users, but not if it is being shared in a shared space or area. This is because a shared printer would require to be brought to a central location for the convenience of the many users.\n5. Thus, the question indicates that a printer cannot be used by thousands of a users unless it is shared in a centralized location.\n6. So, considering that each printer can generally support multiple users, it can\u2019t be used by more than 10 users at one particular time. Hence, D: \"print shop\" is an appropriate answer.\n7. A \u2018print shop\u2019 is a business that focuses on the printing of documents and other media materials, which is necessary for many businesses. This implies the requirement of multiple printers to be used by multiple people within their organization.\n8. Moreover, a \u2018print shop\u2019 is the most probable location for printers that can  be used by thousands of other users, since the number of people working within an \u2018print shop' varies with each business it serves.\nSo the final ans is D:\\print shop\\\n\nInput: What is the main benefit of a VPN?

Options A \u2018middle of nowhere' is a term used widely around the world to describe a place completely isolated from other populated areas so this cannot be the correct answer.\n3.) Option B: \u2018a small town' is also an inappropriate answer because the street passes through the whole country which is made up of many small towns.\n4.)

The given options are 'ocean', 'end of the line', 'pond', 'ocean', and D is not an option as it refers to 'line'.\n5. 'Ocean' is not a correct answer as it may be far away and so may not be accessible by the kid; similarly, 'pond' is not accurate.\n6. 'To the end of the line' is used for calling someone from the other end of the phone line in a similar manner.\n7. 'END OF THE LINE' as it refers to the end of a phone line.\n8. However, there may be an alternative interpretation of the word 'line' as in 'end of a fishing line', referring to a length of cord that is usually used to catch fishes.\n9. This is a viable answer given that 'fish' is another correct option, and the correct interpretation can be inferred from the context.\n10. Therefore, the most suitable answer would be 'end of the line'.\nSo the final answer would be B: end of the line\n\nInput:Why did the cow cross the road?

'Getting fat'also implies a negative connotation, which wouldn't fit in with the neutral tone of the question.\n4. 'Typing words' would mean you'd be doing something with your time, which contradicts the idea of wasting time.\n5. 'Falling asleep' could mean to go to sleep, which makes sense for someone watching TV but also contradicts the idea of accomplishing nothing.\n6.

From the question, we can deduce that \"they went to see\" the thing they came up to decide.\n3. Also, the question specifies that it was a \"quiet evening\" i.e. that they could not have spent that evening on crowded locations.\n4. Thus, based on the above information, we believe that they would likely have gone to see a movie or restaurant in order to enjoy a quiet evening with each other.\n5. Moreover, it is mentioned that they wanted to go to a \"quiet\" place. Thus, one of the places they can go to is a quiet movie theatre or quiet restaurant, i.e. one that is not busy. \n6. This means that it is not logically possible to go to any other place like a wedding.\n7. This could not be a concert too as a concert, as an active place of entertainment, is not quiet at all.\n8.

The following options may be the most relevant: Box: In a box, the money will likely be stored amongst many other things that could make it difficult to retrieve without damaging the contents; Purse: It could be stored in someone's purse alongside many different items that could make it difficult; Cash drawer: Keeping the money in a cash drawer can make it challenging, but it would likely be easier and more accessible for the accountant to remove it.\n5.

By deduction, we can find where one is likely to bring their attache case based on one of the given options given.\n3. Let's start with option A: overhead compartments are unlikely for an attache case since an attache case is compact and light and most airlines require them to be checked in for security reasons as opposed to being stored in the overhead compartments.\n4. Moreover, the business meeting in an office setting is more appropriate for laptop bags and sleek backpacks rather than an attache case.\n5. Option C is not suitable for an attache case due to its medical connection.\n6. Option D, a hospital setting, indicates it is more suitable for an attache to be used for medical equipment and documents than personal items.\n7.

The question asks James if he's worried at all about whether he will be accepted or rejected.\n3. To be successful in this job, James is clearly worried that he might not be accepted if he doesn't have the qualifications.\n4. One option is to find a replacement qualified if he doesn't get accepted, but that\u2019s not what he\u2019s considering because he's aiming to be successful in this job.\n5. Instead of this, he\u2019s considering taking this job even if he doesn\u2019t have all the qualities that it asked for, which he might do if he has the necessary skills or experience, but he might not in this case.\n6. Thus \"less sleep\" is the only one that doesn't make any sense because he obviously needs to be awake for his job if he takes it, and \"job\u201d is already included as a qualified.\n7. We're left with \u201cless sleep\", \"hope\", and \"employment\", each making sense to a different extent.  Less sleep can be a possibility, but his question doesn't focus on the number of hours he'll need to sleep or whether he can make it through the day, thus it's out. Hope would imply that he isn't sure whether he'll be successful in this job or not.\n8. As the question states that he clearly knows that this job will be a good fit for him, hope wouldn't be his main concern.\n9. Employment can also be ruled out because it doesn't make sense.  Whether his experience or skills match up to their requirements will not affect whether he gets accepted or rejected by a company.\n10. Instead, it\u2019s their qualifications and acceptance of candidates that would affect whether a person\u2019s hired, which doesn't seem to line up with him being worried that he won\u2019t fit in because of his qualifications.\n11.

However, the most suitable answer needs to be one that relates to convenience more than delivery so we eliminated 'home delivery' options (A, D, E).\n5. We also eliminated option B (mail order), since it would not be convenient since it requires the customer to order and wait for the product to be delivered - thus making it less convenient than other options. \n6. For the rest of the options; (I, C) are used for payments. This is because convenience is related to ease of use rather than payments, as opposed to option E (spend money).\n7. Therefore, option C ('place money on counter') is the most suitable option as it has relation to convenience and is used to make purchases.\n8. Based on our reasoning, option C is the best answer.\nSo the correct answer is : Option C (Place money on counter)\n\nInput: A company needs experienced and able to do what?

However, all of the above have been mentioned as possible outcomes, but there is a 5th option.\n\n* being tired: playing for many years may tire a person and cause them to stop playing. \n\nSo, of the given options, 'tennis elbow' can be eliminated because it is a specific injury due to overuse, 'becoming a professional player' is excluded because it is not a physical outcome, while 'victory' is excluded because being a professional player is a means to achieve the final result.\n5. Out of the remaining options, 'exercise' is eliminated because it is not a specific outcome of playing, and 'exercise' can be viewed as a physical outcome of other types of exercise.\n6.

From the context of the question, however, the outcome being asked about is a possible negative physical outcome, so; 'being tired' is eliminated because players can also train intensely to become stronger, so if players are getting tired after playing, it is not a desired outcome.\n8. Similarly; 'having tennis elbows' can similarly be ruled out because this is a type of injury and not a desired physical outcome. \n9. However, 'victory' as a physical outcome cannot be eliminated because it indicates that playing tennis can lead to victory in a match. \n10.", "answer": "A: tennis elbow"}

Among these, an area in New York City, which is known for its high-end, expensive shopping, is referred to as 'Downtown area'\n5. So, considering we are speaking about 'high school', 'the lost city of Atlantis', 'container', and 'ocean floor', none of these places are typically places of shopping.\n6. Also, even if they were, it would clearly not be a 'downtown' area, since that's a specific type of location.\n7. Therefore, the remaining options include: 'downtown area' and 'container'\n8.

This is due to the mention of being able to do what he wants.

A health center or an emergency room will not provide a contraceptive if one is not available, so the person must have the option of searching the person's own body for a birth control method.\n4. However, the vagina is not a birth control method, and the medicine cabinet or drawer are not viable options in a context where time and space may be limited.\n5.

{"text": "1.' Automatic doors' is an indication of a modern technology.\n2. Townhouse and building do not have automated doors.\n3. 'Neighbour's house' implies that a house on the neighbourhood belongs to your neighbour, hence would have automatic door.\n4. The question asks 'what kind of house..?', and not 'what kind of house does your neighbour have...?'.\n5. Hence, we can exclude option C.\n6. Townhouse does not have automatic doors and neither does building.\n7. 'Light sensors' is also a sign of modern technology.\n8. 'Downtown' is a city with more buildings.\n9. And 'Modern house' is a house that is up to date with modern technology or trends.\n10. From the context, we understand that the garage and its doors are automated.\n11. We can also eliminate option E because garages in 'downtown' would be unlikely to be automated.\n12. Thus, from the given options that best match the context, A and B are the only logical answer choices. \nSo the final answer might be either A: a modern house or B: a building, or if downtown area is a city or a town, then C: a townhouse.\n\nInput:When the sun set it was the hottest time of the day, but when the sun set, what was happening? Choices:  C: day was ending E: night D: night was settling in E: day was turning into night F: the day was cooling down\nOutput: 1.) The question states that, at the time of sunset, the day was at its hottest, not the coolest.\n2.) Furthermore, as it is asking at what time is the day hottest, and night setting it, we conclude that it is night when the day is at its hottest.\n3.) If it were not night, then there would be no way of telling the sun was setting.\n4.) Therefore, as the sun is setting, it must be night, not day.\n5.) The question then asks what we might expect to be happening during night.\n6.) The words used here in the question implies that the sun set, which is happening during night, not day. The sun never sets during day.\n7.)", "answer": "A: modern house"}

Options \u201cat home\u201d and \"come back\u201d imply that Billy has stayed at home at times in the past, and probably does so in the future. Therefore, they are inappropriate here.\n3. Options \"B\" and \"C\", however, suggest that Billy has not always stayed at home. Option \u201cB\u201d, in particular, suggests that staying at home is not Billy\u2019s \u201chome team\u201d or the location he prefers to stay in.\n4. Similarly, option \u201cC\u201d, implies that staying at home was not a pleasant experience for Billy, and he preferred to be elsewhere.\n5.

This means that people will most likely keep their magazines inside the cupboard in their home.\n5.

{"text": "1) The question talks about getting in the news.\n2. Based on the given context, it can be deduced that the story in the news is about people getting into accidents.\n3. One possible scenario could be that the lady is upset because many people around her are getting involved in accidents.\n4. In this case, \"accidents hurt people\" would make sense because people who get into accidents suffer injuries.\n5. However, this is not the only possible explanation of the news story, and we cannot be sure exactly what the story is about.\n6. Another possible scenario is that there is an increase in the number of accidents in the area.\n7. In this case, we know that an \"uptick\" in accidents is associated with an increased likelihood of being involved in an accident.\n8. In both of these scenarios, the man's response would make sense, as he is correct that people are involved and hurt in accidents frequently and everywhere.\n9. Eliminating all other possible interpretations of the story leaves only the options \"A: happen to people\" and \"E: happen anywhere\".\n10.

D: it was only going to be temporary anyway. E: the defendant is still capable of redemption.\nOutput: 1: In this story, the word 'death' is used in reference to capital punishment - where a person sentenced to death is executed by the state.\n2. The person is granted a last-minute  reprieve - that is, a delay in the  scheduled execution  -  because of some final argument.\n3.  The final argument that is offered in favor of their staying alive  is one of'redemption' - that is, the chance for the condemned person to turn his life around.\n4.

{"text": "1.'Why would you not want' means why wouldn\u2019t one think about working with wood?\n2.Think about working in wood means 'doing work with wood', which in most cases suggests construction-related work or carpentry.\n3.Most people find carpentry a physical and tiring work.Therefore, we can infer that one may wish to opt for other job rather than working with wood.\n4.Mentioning wood in a question about a job means there is a likely job related to wood in the option.\n5.Looking at the options available: A and B are not possible since blisters and frustration occur due to work and if one is unable to work with wood, then why would they get blisters or frustrated? Choices C and D are incorrect too because money and being paid indicates that they are the opposite of 'wouldn\u2019t want'.\n6.Thus, E: \u2019make money\u2019 is the correct answer because if one doesn\u2019t want to work with wood then they would like to make money from it.\nSo the final answers is E: make money\n\nInput: Which of the following is not a form of advertising?

The story ends with him putting in a stop-loss bet, which indicates that he is ready to lose his bets.\n4. This leaves us to infer that he was winnings a huge amount.\n5. The question asks what he would do with his winnings.\n6. Looking further into the description and the ending of the story, there aren't any mentions about what the gambler wants to do.\n7. His winnings are likely to be a huge amount, but the end of the story is quite unclear how much he is winning.\n8. There should be at least one option that specifically mentions gambler winning a lot.\n9. As mentioned earlier,'matchwinning' doesn't really relate to gambler winning a big amount but rather means winning the game.\n10. 'Cash in' similarly suggests investing it rather saving it.\n11. 'Compete' and'return' have also been narrowed down because they are mentioned in the context of betting rather than savings.\n12.

{"text": "1.[The question asks about the location where Billy might be bouncing a ball against a target on the wall.\n\n2.We know the target on the wall could be anything,  but the location where Billy bounced the ball suggests a confined space.\n3.Based on this, the answer is most likely to be in a confined space. It was said that Billy bounced the ball on the wall; thus, he might be in a place where one is able to bounce the ball on a wall.\n4.This could be in any room with a wall but  it would  likely be in a small room because they are the only type of rooms where one can play inside with the door shut and wall to bounce a ball on.\n5.Also, we know the target on the ball is there for him to bounce the ball against so it could be anywhere in the room. Therefore, there could be any object on the room where he might be playing.\n6.These objects include:  \"a pool table,\"  \"a toy box,\"  \"a play room,\"  \"a park,\" and  \"a closet.\"\n\n7.The only place that is not a small room is  \"a park\" and  \"a closets\" because these two are outdoors and indoors respectively, with no mention of being confined.\n8.Hence, the best option is  \"a closet\".  A  \"playroom\" could be small but it's not a  \"closet,\" while a toy box is not a place to play by yourself unless it's a  \"playroom\" or  \"a closet\" that has a toy box inside it. Also, a park and a pool table are not small enclosed spaces. (Pool tables are also not as common as toy boxes. This is also why the answer is not \"a toy box\" even though these items are small.)\nSo the final answer will be closet\n\nInput: The problem is how to educate the many who do not read.

{"text": "1.\"Lots of attention\" and \"getting\" suggests that the ferret is the one causing the attention, not the one receiving it.\n2. Looking at the options, E: mother's home is the only option where a ferret would be found, while the rest refer to the places where it's receiving attention.\n3. So, the correct answer would be E: mother's house, since this would be the only option where a Ferret would actually be found.\nSo the final correct answer is E: mother's\n\nInput:He found no reason to use words because his wife's silence gave him a feeling of peace he knew had lasted how many years?

Choices: \n1: it's fun to interact with others\n2: it lessens the feeling of isolation\n3: it increases the value of the language you're learning\n4. there's less financial competition in the industry\nOutput:\n1. 1: If almost everyone was learning the language, it would not be fun as we would be more isolated (more people on individual level and not a competitive atmosphere).\n2.\"lessens...isolation\": This option states that lessens isolation.\n3. It increases the value if you are not competing with other language learners and there is enough market for you to utilise.\n4: More people learning the same thing makes it less of a financial opportunity as a number of people become a part of the competition.\nSo the final solution is 3: \"increases\".", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

{"text": "1: The question asks what cats would typically and routinely do.\n2. From the options provided, cats tend to:\n  * Drink water.\n  * Eat food.\n  * Annoy (which may imply the cat's antics).\n  * Play\n3. It can be stated that these are things cats tend to do throughout their daily routines.\n4. But, as per the sentence structure, it's not always clear what the answer would be.\n5. Therefore using process of elimination:\n  Let's assume open doors and need food are options which are likely to be correct/completed.\n6. If a cat walked over a door, we can assume the door would be opened automatically.\n7. So, option B: \"open doors\", is clearly wrong.\n8. Option A: \"open doors\" can only relate to this scenario, if there is some kind of automation/robot present.\n9. If we look at options D: \"annoy\" and E: \"play\", we know cats probably wouldn't need to open any doors before drinking water or eating food.\n10. Options C: \"need food\", B: \"open doors/drink water\", D: \"annoy\", and E: \"play\" are incorrect.\n11. Option D: \"annoy\": we know cats can open doors of their own volition. Furthermore, drinking water and having food are often a part of their daily routine, which may involve their wandering around doors or opening them while on their mission.\n12. Therefore, the correct answer is E: play\nSo the final answer that is correct is E: play\n\nInput:What kind of person is capable of audacious deeds and has nothing to lose? Choices: 1: An adventurer 2: A hero 3: A warrior B: A recluse 4: A cynic 5: An outlaw\nOutput:1. The question asks for person who could potentially be capable of audacious acts.\n2. Audacious acts usually come with some kind of penalty or cost, so a person capable of these acts will likely have something to lose. This suggests they have courage or determination to do something difficult or impossible.\n3. The options provided are people who may be considered to have", "answer": "C: need food"}
{"text": "1 The question asks where are seats most likely bleacher.\n2. We know that an audience is likely to be present at the location of the events listed in the given choices.\n3. Seats at such events are arranged in a way that provides a clear view of the event.\n4. We can say that the best location for seats would be the rear, as this is likely to provide a clear, unblocked view of the event. The word \u201cbleacher\u201d refers to the area of seating in sport venues and places like schools and universities that may sometimes be arranged in sections, rows, or other patterns.\n5. Thus, the location of seats in the rear of the venue is most likely to be the bleachers.\nSo the final answe is D: lecture hall\n\nInput: Which of these sentences best reflects a metaphor? Choices: 1. The sun was a rising star, the blue of the water was pure in all its rapture. 2. The water was cool even in the hot sun. 3. I have made up my mind like a river to flow to the salt sea. ____. Output: 1. In sentence 1, \u201cThe sun was a rising star\u201d is metaphorical in that it presents the sun as something other than a star, namely a rising star.\n2. No, this sentence does not reflect a metaphor.\n3. No, the first part of sentence 3 (\u201c\u2026 was pure in all its Rapture\u201d) is metaphorical, but the second part (\u201cThe water was cool even in \u2026\u201d) is not.\n4. The sentence \u201cThe water was cool even \u2026\u201d can be interpreted to mean that the water was cold even in the hot sun (ie. it remained cool despite the hot sun), which is not considered a metaphor. The second part of sentence 3, \u201cI have made \u2026\u201d refers to the first part of the sentence, \u201c\u2026 a river\u201d, and is therefore also not reflective of metaphor.\n5. \u201cI have made \u2026 a river\u201d can be interpreted as a metaphor that speaks to the flow of the water and the way it travels toward the ocean to create the sea.\n6. The sentence is correct.\nSo the final answere is 3: I have made up my mine like a river to flow", "answer": "E: hockey game"}
{"text": "1) This question asks about the most suitable situation for reading a magazine while waiting for a vehicle to arrive.\n2) The phrase \u201con rails\u201d implies that there are rail tracks next to the waiting area which might be at a train station.\n3) Therefore, the reader would be at a train station if they are reading magazines while they wait for a train.\n4) However, the given options: vegetables (not a destination type), market (not the same as a train station), doctor (not the same as magazines) and bookstore don\u2019t fit this description.\n5) So, the most likely destination that would fit this description would be a train station.\n6) So, the answer to this question would be C) Train station.\nSo the final answeer is C: Train Station\n\nInput: If you saw your neighbors' children, you could probably help them get what? Choices: A: homework done B: snack C: bath D: toys E: food\nOutput: 1: This question asks about helping one\u2019s neighbors\u2019 children out with homework\n2: The choice of words would suggest that one might want to do this when they would come across their neighbours, as in a chance meeting.\n3: There is also a possibility that one could help their neighbors\u2019 children even if the opportunity is not just in a chance meeting, but by seeing a notice on the community board.\n4: Thus it is clear that one will be in touch with their neighbours so that one can find out opportunities to help their neighbors\u2019 kids with their homework\n\n5: The only other explanation would be if you worked for the same organization with that neighbor, as homework help could be requested from the class teacher.\n\n6: However, there are still other options like that of a community helper or a volunteer teacher (though there is very little chance of it)\n\n7: All the other options except E, are possible\n\n8: That leaves us with E: Food\n\n9: As there is no information about a neighbor being in need of any particular type of food, or about a food bank anywhere, the answer is very much limited to food.\n\n10: So, E: Food, is the most probable answer\n\nSo the final answer would be E: Food\n\nInput: Ones goal is to find which pair", "answer": "D: train station"}

The dog says \u201cWhat a silly pig\u201d. 3. Neither the dog nor the pig can see up. 4. The dog says, \u201cWhat a strange pig\u201d.\nOutput: \"A dog, a pigs, and a cow are at the bottom of a very deep well. The dog asks \u201cHow high is up\u201d, the pig says \u201cHow much is a mile and a half down?\u201d and the cow says nothing.\"\n2. All the answers are a different way of repeating what is already said in the sentence.\n3. The pig said \"how much is a mile and half down\" which indicates that the pig asked \"how\" to describe how much is a mile and 1/2 down. If the pig wanted to say \"how much...\", then the pig is asking \"how tall is it\".\nSo the correct answer the dog replied \"how much is a mille and a half down\"  to the pink's question.\nSo the answer is 3.", "answer": "A: beast"}

Looking at the given given options, A: oklahoma,B: developed land,C: united states,D: desert,E: mexico, we can eliminate options B, C as they are either related to real estates or land development as opposed to road travel.\n3. Option D: desert can be ruled out since a desert is not a place that a high way will take you (unless you are traveling westward).\n4. Moreover, even if we would change the direction of travel, deserts are present all through the western United States and Mexico.\n5. Thus, the options left are either A: oklahoma, a state in the south central region or E: mexico, a country in the south south western region.\n6. While both of these locations are south of Texas, they do not form a logical sequence given the constraints of the question.\n7.

Choices: 1. A: To deposit 2. B: To withdraw C: To leave D: To have 3. E: A checking account\nOutput: 1- The question asks why an individual might have a large amount of money in their bank account\n2- To deposit means that an individual is adding to an existing sum of money in their account, therefore \n3- to have a large amount of bank means they are withdrawing this amount of money from their account\n4- A checking account refers to an account specifically intended to hold money (checks) in anticipation of a future expense, and is not the type of account the person would use to store a large amount of money as to \"have\".\n5- As to B and C, having a large amount of money simply means that the person has it in their possession and has not used it to make a large transaction.\n6- Therefore, the best possible answer to the question would be to put C because it is the only statement that does not contain any information contradictory to the question.\nSo the final", "answer": "A: feeling refreshed"}

'Line' is not usually associated with banks, good books or bus stops.\n4. 'Line' is only known to be formed in a situation involving people.\n5. Banks and books are associated with work and studies respectively, while bus stops are an area of movement or commute.\n6. At a time of noon, a bus stop makes absolutely no sense. One would stay at home or work.\n7. Similarly, a post office or a bank needs to be closed at the time of noon. If a bank or post office is open, people are either doing transactions in the bank or taking out a mail at the post office. For this, a customer may be in the queue but not be in line.\n8. 'At a good book' refers to being immersed in reading a good book rather than forming a physical line.\n9. A book is not known to stand on the floor as a person in line would.\n10. Therefore, among the available options, only a bank at noon and a bus stop seem most likely.\n11. At noon, banks usually would be closed or people would be busy with work and not be waiting in a particular line in it.\n12. Similarly, the bus stop does not seem conducive to a scenario wherein a line of people is in need of a coat since it's an area of movement.\n13.

Choice B: Parking lot may seem unrelated to animals. However, as John would be careful not to go to places where he might see animal abuse, a parking lot may have animals in cages or crates, which could lead to animal abuse.6. Choice C: Woodlands could refer to a place where animals might be kept or rehabilitated for their own good. However, if John is against abuse, he would want to avoid places that might lead to animal abuse, so woodlands may not be an option.7. Choice D: North America could  refer to a specific location in North America for animals. As John is wary of going to places where animals might be abused, he would likely avoid places such as zoos, animal shelters, or conservation centers in North America.8. Choice E: PARK - while PARK stands for park, it is too general and doesn't specify which park. It is not known if John is from a specific area, such as New York City or Los Angeles, and this would determine which parks he might avoid.9.

Moreover, the answer A: \"driving\" is mentioned once in the sentence, implying that it is something that has already been established and no longer needs to be mentioned or clarified.\n5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Finally, the answer C is incorrect because it suggests a negative and unfortunate event: accidents.\n6.

A: keep promise B: fulfil obligations C: do nothing D: repay debts E: maintain commitments\nOutput: 1,2. The question asks about what the phrase \"make good (on) a promise\" means.\n2. The phrase \"make good on (of)\" appears to be a verb in the phrase \"make good\" which implies that it refers to fulfilling a promise made earlier.\n3. The phrase \"keep promise\" is a verb that is used to indicate fulfilling a promise as seen in its dictionary meaning - \"fulfill a promise or agreement.\"\n4. This implies that the phrase \"make good \" may be referring to keeping a promise.\n5. The phrase \"fulfil obligations\" is a compound word that also refers to keeping a promise as seen in it's dictionary meaning- \"perform (an agreement or promise) that may have been made earlier.\"\n6. This indicates that the phrase \"fulfil obligation\" can also potentially be an option.\n7. However, the phrase \"make good...\" appears to be singular in phrase so another singular answer choice would be necessary to accommodate the singularity of the verb \"make good (on).\n8. Accordingly, the phrase \"repay debts\" also appears to mean to perform (an agreement or promise), this can be supported by its dictionary meaning \"be obliged to do something after making a promise or loan to someone.\"\n9. Therefore, the answer options that may include the verb \"make good...\" are \"", "answer": "A: driving"}
{"text": "1. We understand that the homework assignments are kept in binders.\n2. The question asks which location would house these binders.\n3. A backpack isn't suitable as homework assignments are usually done during class hours and not outside.\n4. Bookcase isn't suitable either as it would only contain the required textbooks.\n5. The office-supply store only sells items. They do not store the assignments.\n6. Class room doesn't make sense either as homework is supposed to be done at home, not school.\n7. Lastly, the correct answer is an office because that's where the teacher may keep the homework assignments.\n8. This can be narrowed down to any office that a teacher would reside at.\n9. Therefore the correct answer is again D: office, where the teacher would be.\n\n## Part II\n\n### Instruction:If you were a soccer player, what would be a good thing to do on or around your foot?\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nInput : What is the best thing to do on or near a paw? Choices: \n1. A: get blood on it \n2. B: lick it off \n3. C: get saliva on it \n4. D: wipe it off \n5. E: get an insect on it \n6. F: get sweat on it\nOutput : \n1. We know that paws are used by pets as their hands. \n2. The paw would be dirty because it interacts with the earth or ground, but can easily be cleaned off.\n3. The paw has sensitive organs that can be damaged by any foreign substance, such as dirt or dust, that has been dragged in from outside. \n4. The foot/paw area should be clean, but also treated with care because any abrasive substance could hurt or irritate the fragile skin of the inner foot/paw toes.\n5.

{"text": "1: The question asks you to identify what you would see if you look at blinking lights in the night.\n2. There are plenty of things that you would see blinking at night. The blinking lights could be on any cars, planes, balloons, or flashlights.\n3. Amongst many options, the one that stands out from the rest is the one about a 'penguin\u2019s bum'.\n4. Penguins make noises and are found in an Antarctic weather, not the night sky. Therefore, this is the least possible option.\n5. We can eliminate the option of planes and balloons because we would have seen them even in the daytime as well.\n6. We can also eliminate choices A, C and D because they are also known to blink.\n7. Option E is a phrase that denotes the bum or butt or posterior area of a penguin, but this would definitely not be seen in the sky at night!\n8. We end up with the only valid option left being B: plane.\n9. A plane blinking is the perfect answer.\nSo the finally answer is B: plane\n\nInput:I don't do much for my father, but he never forget it.

Looking at each of the other 5 answers, the question would be asking whether the given options are done by the person for his father or not.\n5. Looking at option A, we would have definitely remembered that the action being performed is for one's father.\n6. Looking back at the question, the option of 'forgetting' has been used in the previous sentence.\n7. Option B would be an appropriate answer since doing anything for the purpose of gain would most certainly be done with forgetting.\n8. Option C is similar to option B but refers to a specific situation of gain, but gain is often forgotten as well.\n9. Option D is related to the idea of doing something for the sake of forgetting.\n10. However, forgetting", "answer": "B: plane"}

The possible answer could be \u2018compliments\u2019 or \u2018avoid pain\u2019.\n6. Since the other choice is a schoolwork-based question, we might think that the person is good at their schoolwork.\n7. However, being really good at schoolwork means the student gets lots of compliments.\n8. Therefore, we select the question that is schoolwork related and eliminate the rest.\n9. We can then select the right answer.\nSo the correct answer is A: compliments\n\nInput:What is the reason for making a wooden spoon? Choices:  a) to use for cooking b) for wood carving c) for measuring the depth of a stream d) for serving soup e) for making musical instruments\nOutput: 1.\"Wooden spoon\" means a wooden spatula used for cooking.\n2.From other options that are about making wooden spoon: \"We can expect that there would be a wood-carving tool\" this shows that the wood is carved.\n3. \"Then,  we can imagine that there is a tool to measure the depth of a stream\" a tool could be carved.\n4. \"For making musical instruments\" also the one could be made of wood.\n5.

The most realistic option in this case is the one that's stressful and dangerous but easier to drive.\n5.)

The question relates to a scenario where someone is driving too fast on an ice-covered road.\n7. Being more'stressful' suggests that the person's anxiety escalates due to the road conditions, making driving more difficult.\n8. The other options provided may suggest similar problems, such as 'dangerous', but driving too fast could also be deadly, which is a far more serious issue than being stressed.\n9. Being 'harder when weather bad' may seem redundant, but it clarifies that the driving conditions will generally be more difficult when weather is bad.\n10.

Out of these options, 'dissipate' means being spent up and getting wasted, which is not what is being asked.\n4. 'flown' indicates being taken away, which does not make sense as something would have to take the money if it existed to start with.\n5. 'disintegrate' means to break down into parts. This makes no sense with regards to the context of the question.\n6. 'fall apart' means failing, which does not match the tone of the question since it appears as if the person had not spent it.\n7. 'penultimate' means the second to the last of a series. This doesn't fit the context of the question either.\n8. There are no other alternatives to choose from, and it is clear that all the previous answers are invalid.\n9. The only answer that makes sense here is 'become spent.\n10. When a person uses all their money and there is none left, it gets'spent', which could mean that it is no longer there in an account or any wallet or something.\n11.

The given options provide information about the bull in the context the question is asked, the question is likely referring to a bull in the financial markets in this case.\n3. Bull means a strong positive movement in the stock market i.e. when stock prices surge.\n4. When his friend tells him a bull could be any of these, they are referring to the definition of 'bull' in the financial market.\n5. So the bull doesn't move in a direction of weakness meaning the 'bull' is moving upwards and not charging prey instead. So if the bull was charging prey it has to be a cow.\n6. Thus, an option that can be bull is 'bull' not 'feeble' and option bull is a very strong movement and hence is not referred to as 'feeble'.\n7. Next option cow can be used to describe an animal 'bull' is used to describe in the context of the question, the animal is feeble which means it cannot be used to describe the movement of the market.\n8.

Thus, from the given options which are his great-grandfather's house, family picture book, brother's house, family tree, and family reunion, his father's house is the best option to consider.\n6. The other options do not suggest a father-daughter relationship, whereas the \"father's house\" could represent James' father's house, which is likely to belong to James' niece's father.\n7.

{"text": "The question is 'what will happen if you are succesful when committing suicide?'\n1. Looking at the options, it is clear that only one option is incorrect in this sentence, and that is E: 'kill yourself'.\n2. The sentence 'what will happen if......' implies the possibility of a certain event happening.\n3. The options offered in response clearly state that the person will experience various outcomes if they commit suicide successfully or unsuccessfully, namely'scars','sorrow','misery' and 'killing themselves'.\n4. The option'succesful when committing sucide' is a bit ambiguous and not clear as it does not imply an event but assumes that the person would have already completed the suicide action.\n5. We do not know whether the option will be inapplicable if the suicide action was not successful.\n6. If we eliminate 'kill yourself' from the option list, then it is clear that the other options suggest that the person will not kill themselves if they are successful in committing suicide.\n7. It can be inferred that if successful, the person will not kill him/herself but will experience the various outcomes expressed in the given options.\n8.

This is because getting paid for something is the most obvious option which would result from an artist capitalizing on his fandom.\n10. Thus, the answer is D:'receiving money'.\nSo the final answer was D: receiving money\n\nInput: Who wants to work as a waiter at a chain restaurant nowadays? Choices: 1.

Michigan has a lot of farming areas.\n3.) The question asks about what state has the shape of a \"glove\" with lots of \"farming areas\".\n4.) The top of the hand points away from north dakota, so it is unlikely that the answer is north dakota.\n5.) The other states that border Michigan are Ohio on the south, Wisconsin on the east and Minnesota on the north so it\u2019s unlikely that the answer is Wisconsin or Minnesota.\n6.) The other states that are pointed away from Michigan are Illinois on the south west and Indiana on the south east so we can eliminate these as well.\n7.) North dakota is the most likely answer, as it is shaped like a hand pointing to the top of the glove. 8.)

Choices: A: that forest B: this forest C: these forests D: that leaf E: these leaves\nOutput: 1.: There are trees at the top of the maple tree and a lake at the foot of it.\n2. The river can also lead us to think this is a body of water like a river.\n3. The maple tree could represent a maple leaf that grows on any tree, which could be any forest.\n4. The lake can lead us to think that this \"leaves on the maple tree\" represents \"leafy\".\n5. \"Leafy\" could potentially refer to any forest as well.\n6. At the top and the foot of the maple is written \"this forest\" and \"these forests\" which makes this answer more plausible.\n7. The river would likely be the water found flowing through a river of that forest.\n8. The leaves could indicate the leaves of the maple tree which are found in this forest.\n9. \"These leaves\" seems more specific, as leaves can only be found on a tree and not on a forest.\n10. \"These leaves on the maple\" seems", "answer": "C: michigan"}

It hints that the items are either packaged or sold together and can be bought from a common vendor.\n3. One such option would be CB: Bedroom, but it is not logical to assume that one would buy a hairbrush alongside bandages in their bedroom, which is used primarily for resting and personal hygiene, as the products can also alternately be bought from other more suitable places.\n4. Hence, looking at the other options, the only two relevant ones that fit the bill are A: Drugstore and B: Hospital.\n5. Hospitals are not a go-to place for buying hairbrushes, but they do provide bandages, as such items fall under the purview of medicine and are common there.\n6. Similarly Drugstores provide hair products, some of them include hairbrushes.\n7.

Choices: 1. A: to look pretty B: to be able to see clearly C: to be safer D: to be more efficient\nOutput: 1) The question asks why one should have more than one light-bulb.\n2. There are multiple reasons to have light-bulbs than just one:\n3. To Be Able To See Clearly: One should definitely prefer having two light-bulbs instead of one because two can provide twice the amount of light compared to one light bulb.\n4. To Be Safer: One should consider the chances of an unfortunate accident happening while someone is working with a single light bulb when there is an option of having two for added safety.\n5. To Be More Efficient: Two light bulbs can use less energy than one light bulbs thereby saving on electricity costs and also having a friend to rely on while there is a power failure.\n6. Based on the above, the answer cannot be \u201cA\", which is: to look pretty, since it is more of a reason to have lighting in the first place, rather than adding more light bulbs, although not an unreasonable approach.\n7. Likewise, answers \u201cB\" and \"C\" are not the purpose of having more than one light bulbs either.\n8. The correct answers \"D\" and \"E\" are both about efficiency and safety, which are the two main reasons to have lighting at all (for safety and to be able to use something, of which safety is a sub-reason in the first place).\n9.

Similarly, 'good karma' can be activated merely through good deeds, such as by having good intent despite not fulfilling it or not having any good deeds to offer and still having a good heart.\n6. Thus, it seems most plausible that by being forgiving, you might unlock'respect' for yourself as it is the only option that explicitly signifies the feeling of respect.\nSo the final answers is C: respect\n\nInput: I feel an impulse to what, when around some people? Choices:  F: trust A: speak D: stay silent B: listen E: share\nOutput: 1: The question asks about an impulse we may feel around some people.\n2. Here the implied word is'someone' which signifies that it's some people, not a specific person.\n3. Furthermore, the question seems to imply that 'feeling an impulse to'something is the goal but also the problem.\n4. It would help to consider the options in that context.\n5. 'Trust' and 'Speak' would be impulses to act towards the given person which would be good, but perhaps not what is intended.\n6. It would likely help to determine what the'something' would be and the given person's position.\n7. For example, if it is a teacher addressing students, 'trust' and'speak' might be a problem.\n8. If it's a manager addressing employees, these might be the desired options.\n9. Also, there would typically be 'trust' and'speak' in any relation.\n10. 'Stay silent' would likely be a bad", "answer": "B: good karma"}
{"text": "1: The question speaks about a problem with a person\u2019s pens not working.\n2. The question asks what to do when pens aren\u2019t working.\n3. There are a few reasons why pens stop working, a common one being the ink cartridge not being replaced or refilled.\n4. Since pens are used for taking notes, a person could either ink the pens or change the ink caps to prevent the problems.\n5. The phrases 'ink in' and 'ink caps' mean ink cartridges.\n6. Therefore, answer A means that when one's pens aren't working one should put ink into them.\n7. The other phrases are irrelevant.\n8. So the correct answer is A: ink in.\nSo the final ans is A: ink", "answer": "A: ink in"}

{"text": "1,2.  We understand from the question that Danny hated helping people, and that, it would always bring her good feelings.\n3,4. These sentences indicate that being helpful is not just an inherent personality trait, but one that can bring emotional benefits by helping others.\n5. The option D: \"feel good about myself\" is misleading.\n6. It is not mentioned how helping others made Danny feel about herself.\n7. It could be that helping others in some way made one feel good or bad about themself.\n8. On the other hand, the other options are more closely related to the idea of positivity, which would seem to be the reason Danny always felt good after helping people.\n9. Therefore the correct answer is C: \"complications\"\n10. It refers to the fact that helping others typically results in unforeseen obstacles, leading to complications, such as theft, abuse, or exploitation.\n11. By contrast, \"satisfaction,\" \"good feelings,\" and \"feel good about yourself\" would lead Danny to feel satisfied with herself, happier, and more proud.\n12. This makes complications the most suitable choice among all the given options.\nSo the final answers is C: complications\n\nInput: I have to think about my finances, it affects what? Choices: A: my investments B: my expenditures C: my time D: my debt E: my retirement savings\nOutput: 1-4. We understand that finances are very important to someone and it's their \"responsibility\".\n5,6. Apart from \"responsibility\", finances also affect \"my retirement savings\" as the question asks us to choose from the different options given.\n7. This means that finances directly influence how much a person can save for their retirement.\n8. This further confirms that having money \"affects my investments\", \"affects my expenditures\" and \"affects my debt\".\n9. We can't choose more than one option, so we have to go through the different options to find out which of them is not linked to the question.\n10. If we go through the options, we will see that they are all closely related to the question, but \"respons", "answer": "C: complications"}

{"text": "1) The question states that someone went in to examine something.\n2) From the context of the question, we can assume that the phrase, \"go in to\" refers to going to examine something. This indicates that a person has come to look at the things closely instead of just standing and staring.\n3) Based on this, we can eliminate options A & B which implies that the person is eating the cake/looking at it casually.\n4) Looking at options C, D and E, we know that options C and D only require learning about something with no intention of keeping it permanently.\n5) Option E does not make any sense as it would not make any sense to learn about something that needs to be purchased.\n6) Thus the person is only looking at something to buy it which can be inferred from option D.\n7) Thus, the person is looking at/examining something to learn about it, thus D is the correct option", "answer": "B: buy"}
{"text": "1.A person going to a friend's house to enjoy their company is an example of a social visit. \n2. Social visits can also include spending time with family members at home or visiting others in a care facility, such as a nursing home.\n3. Similarly, a person going to a partner's house or meeting up at a public space for socializing is also a social visit.\n4. The other options do not necessarily exclude the possibility of a person going to a friend or family member's place,\n5. However, among the given options, \"deep thought\" seems to be the least likely choice as it does not involve interacting with other people.\n6. Similarly \"place of work\" does not necessarily require one to spend time with another person, as it could involve individual work, while \"office\" and \"workplace\" are similar in nature and both involve interactions between people at the workplace.\n7. Therefore, the best option among the given choices is \"friend's house\" due to the context of social visits.\nSo the final option is C: friend's place", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

A regular expression lets us perform various checks on data. This lets us parse input and handle them in different ways. So we can check the values coming as our input.\n\nHere is the sample code written for validation of input, for example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction parsInput(input) {\n  input = input.split(\" & \");\n  let answer;\n     if (input.length > 1) {\n     let firstInput = input[0];\n     if (firstInput ==='movie theatre' || firstInput === 'theatre') {\n        answer = \"E: park\"\n      } else if (firstInput === \"alaska\") {\n        answer = 'E: park' //the answer will be same for all the values\n      } else {\n        answer = firstInput\n      }\n     } else {\n     answer = input[0]\n     }\n   return answer;\n}\n```\n\nFor multiple inputs, we can chain Regex and build a better function:\n\n```javascript \nfunction multipleInput(val) {\n  val = val? val.split(\" & \").join(\" || \").split(\"' \") : \"\";\n  if (val.length === 2) {\n    return val[0];\n  } else if (val.length > 1 && val.length % 2 === 0 && val[0] && val[1]) {\n    return [\n     ...val.filter((val) => val!=\" \").join(\" \"),\n     ...\n    ].filter(\n      (val) =>\n        /[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+/g.test(val).length == 2 &&!parseInt(val, 10)? true :", "answer": "B: talent"}

Classify will take a list of strings, call a second function called analyze that will break the string into an array of words. Next the object will iterate over each letter, if that letter appears in the word list, increment the corresponding classifier variable. The classifier variable should be the total of the number of occurrences of a letter in the list of lists. The output of classify should appear in the console, one line for each String.  If a letter appears in a string but not in the list of words, the letter will be considered non-existant and the 0 will be incremented. After 0 is reached we will add a special element of \u201cspecial\u201d with a variable (which will be incremented as a word is added to the list of lists, e.g. \u201cnature\u201d would be \u201cnature1\u201d \u201cnature2\u201d).</h2>\n\n<h2>Examples:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Classify([&quot;city&quot;,&quot;movie theatre&quot;,& quot;country&quot;,&quo t;alaska&quot;]); </li>\n<li>&quot;Park&quot;</li>\n<li>", "answer": "C: every city"}

In the above example \"x\" is being matched against its own \"x\" in order to continue checking against other input if it matches, otherwise it fails to match and stops evaluating. Whereas the function \"Chair\" uses the \"in\" operator, because there is no loop in the function it is possible to retrieve information about the variables in the function and check in a loop without executing another line. In functions, like many other programming languages the variables cannot be modified. This is because it will cause an error if we try to modify the variable within the function because the function will be executing and it will cause an error in the code which we do not want. However at the end of a function, even if the function has been executed successfully, it returns the value of what the variables contain or the value stored in the variable to the function where function returns it.\n\n## What do the functions achieve?\nThe \"Bedtime\" program receives the sentence and performs pattern matching, it then prints on the command line what the output should be and the next line will give the actual output. The \"Chair\" programme evaluates the expression \"x\" and prints the output which is the evaluated expression.\n\n## What are all the possibilities of evaluating the program?\nIn the \"Bedtime\" case, we want to test if the", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

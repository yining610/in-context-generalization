Choices:  H: bicycle  M: skateboard  L: rollerblades  D: motorcycle<n>Output: M: skateboard<n><n>### Explanation:For the answer, I found that my instinct was to go by pattern. <n>So I figured if a cat would be happiest in an alley then a cat park would be happiest in a barn.  In my example, I used the word happiest in the prompt to try and figure out what question was asked, I think that could help in the future or could have for the last two examples.  However, in the last two examples the first example was for a question we all know and then the second one a question we all don't know, so I could look up the question in the online dictionary and find the answer to.  In the third example, I chose the third answer because in many sports you need a helmet like a skateboard, rollerblades, bicycle and motorcycle.  It seems very similar to the other three questions.

A regular expression lets us perform various checks on data. This lets us parse input and handle them in different ways. So we can check the values coming as our input.<n><n>Here is the sample code written for validation of input, for example:<n><n>```javascript<n>function parsInput(input) {<n>  input = input.split(" & ");<n>  let answer;<n>     if (input.length > 1) {<n>     let firstInput = input[0];<n>     if (firstInput ==='movie theatre' || firstInput === 'theatre') {<n>        answer = "E: park"<n>      } else if (firstInput === "alaska") {<n>        answer = 'E: park' //the answer will be same for all the values<n>      } else {<n>        answer = firstInput<n>      }<n>     } else {<n>     answer = input[0]<n>     }<n>   return answer;<n>}<n>```<n><n>For multiple inputs, we can chain Regex and build a better function:<n><n>```javascript <n>function multipleInput(val) {<n>  val = val? val.split(" & ").join(" || ").split("' ") : "";<n>  if (val.length === 2) {<n>    return val[0];<n>  } else if (val.length > 1 && val.length % 2 === 0 && val[0] && val[1]) {<n>    return [<n>     ...val.filter((val) => val!=" ").join(" "),<n>     ...<n>    ].filter(<n>      (val) =><n>        /[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+/g.test(val).length == 2 &&!parseInt(val, 10)? true :

In the above example "x" is being matched against its own "x" in order to continue checking against other input if it matches, otherwise it fails to match and stops evaluating. Whereas the function "Chair" uses the "in" operator, because there is no loop in the function it is possible to retrieve information about the variables in the function and check in a loop without executing another line. In functions, like many other programming languages the variables cannot be modified. This is because it will cause an error if we try to modify the variable within the function because the function will be executing and it will cause an error in the code which we do not want. However at the end of a function, even if the function has been executed successfully, it returns the value of what the variables contain or the value stored in the variable to the function where function returns it.<n><n>## What do the functions achieve?<n>The "Bedtime" program receives the sentence and performs pattern matching, it then prints on the command line what the output should be and the next line will give the actual output. The "Chair" programme evaluates the expression "x" and prints the output which is the evaluated expression.<n><n>## What are all the possibilities of evaluating the program?<n>In the "Bedtime" case, we want to test if the

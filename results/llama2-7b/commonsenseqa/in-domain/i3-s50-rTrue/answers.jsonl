It might be more relevant for other sports like swimming or running, hence we can exclude choice A.\n\nChoice B: Broken bones (choice B) could possibly be the result of a successful season of skiing.  While bones might break as a result of an accident, many activities may cause a person to sustain bruises, cuts, or strains, which would be classified as broken body parts and not broken bones. \n\nChoice D: Chapped lips (choice D) might be the result of successful skiing because if a person spends time outside in the wind and the cold, or has to frequently spit/exhale to get the snow out of the nose, chapped lips might be a possible side effect.\n\nChoice E(Healthy Body) could be the result of successful season of skiing due to the regular exercise and the exposure to the weather, which might result in a healthier body. But the same might be achieved with a healthy diet, yoga, and other exercises, so it also doesn't seem too convincing.\n\nChoice C: Broken Legs (choice C) It should be noted (for later in the analysis) that skiing is considered a risky sport, and if someone skiing suffers a serious injury requiring surgery, it might result in the fracture of the leg and subsequent health issues.

'Prison' refers to the fact that these institutions are located in separate facilities, such as penitentiaries or correctional institutions. Both options are commonly used in reference to a person's imprisonment. Therefore, these cannot be the answer. \n\nBeating him up might be considered a punishment, however it could also be a form of violence that occurs outside of the legal system, thus it cannot be the answer.\n\nGetting arrested implies that he will be detained by police and formally charged with an offense before being brought to trial.

Thus option B: Under rock can be ruled out.\n4. Likewise, Manhatten and groceries store are also ruled out. To summarize, it is not under rocks, Manhattan or a grocery store.\n5. Option C: Toenails means it is inside a person. The sun is not disturbed as it is in a place closed to it.\n6. Fallen trees may be outside, but since they cannot grow into or on top of the tree, they cannot grow on it. Thus option E: Fallen tree cannot be the answer either.\n7. The question could, therefore, be answered by only two choices. The options which cannot be the answer, due to the restriction of sunlight disturbance and sunlight being disturbed on top of groceries and above a rock.\n8. Option B: Manhatten is no longer an option due to the previous statement. This makes option C: Toenails and option D: Grocery store the only two viable choices.\n9. The remaining two options would be narrowed by the fact that they cannot be disturbed by the sun.\n10. Option D: Grocery Store is an interior location, it would not be disturbed by the Sun. Thus, grocery store is ruled out.\n11. This leaves us with answer C: option toenails. Fungus grows on toenails as it requires a warm and moist environment.

Thus, that can also be ruled out.\n4) Choice B refers to a fragile or delicate object that might break easily. However, this may not necessarily indicate that the glass is weak as it must also fail to hold the specified amount of force and pressure.

Eliminating this option doesn't get us any further, since the words that are left don't seem to be synonyms of each other either.  \n\nChoice C: Ocean is a noun and refers to many different words. It is more likely related to a body of water instead of something being dull. \n\nChoice A: Complementary can be used in reference to a specific set of things that make each other complete, so it doesn't imply there is an absence of quality or accuracy. \n\nChoice E: Inaccurate refers to something that's not accurate, like a tool that is not calibrated, and can be correct or incorrect. \n\n3: Now it's time to analyze the remaining words, let's do it:\n\nChoice B: The definition of inelegant means not graceful or pleasing in appearance or expression, so it's probably not the answer. \n\nChoice: A: Sharp means having or exhibiting a sharp or pointed edge for cutting or piercing, so that's not the word.\n\nChoice: E: Accurate indicates having or showing precise knowledge of fact or correctness of a statement, and that could never be applied to anything that is 'often', or 'often dull'. \n\nChoice F: Elegant is defined as pleasing in appearance or design.

Hurt 5. Insecurity\nOutput:\nStep 1: All of the answers are a feeling, so we can eliminate choice 1 (Fear) because you fear the worst (an unpleasant feeling).\nStep 2: We can eliminate choice 2 because, while Uncomfortable (discomfort) is uncomfortable, so it doesn't quite match unpleasant.\nStep 3: We can eliminate choice E (hurt) because hurt is when you're harmed physically or emotionally, so it doesn' t quite match the unpleasant part. Only choices 3 and 4 remain.\n\nSo the answer is choice 4: Hurt", "answer": "B: fire"}
{"text": "Step 5: John joined the army because he wants to see the world, so the fighting will need to take place outside a fort, an orphanage or another country.\n        The fort (choice A) is a stronghold surrounded by walls and defences for protection, which is the complete opposite of what John is interested in.\n        The orphanage (choice B) takes in unwanted or orphaned children so it is unrelated to John seeing things when fighting commences.\n        The Battlefield (choice D) is where fighting takes place.   John would experience death, mayhem and destruction. This seems too extreme for what John wants to experience, he does not want the fighting to take place on a battlefield.\n        Other countries (choice E) would require John to see and experience what is happening in other countries, but he is specifically interested in seeing what kinds of things will happen. Thus, he is not interested in getting to see all countries.\n\nStep 6: If John did not join the army, there would be no fighting, so he can only observe it. If he stayed in his country, John would see the same things as before: land, sky, people and animals.\n\nStep 7: The only reason John would only see certain things when fighting did start, would be if the world was entirely covered in clouds.\n\nStep 8: We are left with seeing only the world and a battlefield. The only places John could see these things would be on a battlefield. If John sees the world, he will see the battlefield, and battlefields can only be on a battlefield - thus, John will see the battlefield.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, John will see what sort of things can only be seen on a battlefield - the battlefield.\nSo the final choice is D: battlefield.\n\nInput: Which of the following is another name for a \"Hail Mary?\" Choice: B.

{"text": "1) First, note that the question is specific only for \"bankrupt company\" so we can rule out D (commit crime) as it is not the only option.\n2) Second, note that every option has some meaningful implications, except for B (own resources), so let's take this choice out of the candidate options.\n3) Third, note that every option except D (go out of business) has relevant consequences, so let's take A (Liquidated) out as well.\n4) Fourth, note that C (branch out), E (Game Over) have not been explained (as far as we see), we can take A (Liquided) and B (own resources)\n5) Lastly, note that B (\"own resources\") refers to the resources of the company itself, as seen e.g. in \"company xyz has exhausted its own resources to make profit\".\n6) Then, note that what's more probably to happen \"when a company is bankrupt\" is to be \"liquidated\"; if a company is liquidated, we see an auction of its assets, i.e. \"selling its resources\".\n7) And then, we have one choice left: D (Go out of business). The company is \"out of business\" when it has no possible means to run it (and is therefore expected to close, as a result). Liquidation refers to the assets of the company only.\n8) Since we have the three implications explained above, we have a winning candidate: D(Go out of business) is the correct answer\nSo the final answer D: Go out of business", "answer": "A: liquidated"}
{"text": "Step 0 - Firstly check the options we are given:\nA: Pay debts. This is a statement that means to repay what is owed. Debts imply that someone owes money to another person, thus it cannot be the correct answer, since that would mean that they cannot pay bills.\nB: Make money. An action of making money is a phrase that means accumulating financial capital. It is, therefore, unlikely to be the correct answer, as that can be done over some period of time, or even when there is a negative net worth (eg borrowing money).\nC. Having money. This phrase is ambiguous. If it means possessing enough money to pay off one's debts, it doesn't say that it does; it implies that one has money (not necessarily enough to pay off their debts).\nD: Making money. Like choice B makes money (accumulating financial capital), but since money is what is being made, it's a bit of an obvious clue.\nE: Keep house. Again, it does not seem to describe someone whose only motivation to pay bills is to avoid losing money. It seems much more closely related to the act of maintaining one's home, such as cleaning it and taking care of belongings.\nStep 1: Check the question. Sometimes it felt like being able pay bills was the reason he was _paying bills_. Therefore, it's not the motivation - but something that occurs AFTER paying bills. The question would never ask about someone who is _motivated_ to pay bills - it is talking about whether they can pay bills _at all_.\nStep 2: Check the options. All can pay bills. The only option that does not pay bills is option E.\nStep 3: Therefore, the answer is the only option which makes sense. (Check again)\nStep 4: The correct option is C: Having money, since it means that what is being paid for is already in the possession of that individual. This can include a home or other capital, but does not necessarily mean actual currency.\nStep 5: Thus the answer is C: Having money.\nSo the final result is C: Having money\n\n### Your Question\n\nInput:The question asks: 'Where do your parents live?'

The second words, as in the case of jar B- straw, and B- jar, contain 'honey', in the case of beehive D- stick and in the case of farmer's market, contain the word'market', indicating that these are not places for buying honey.\n4. Thus, the options left with which to choose are A (stick to fingers), C (beehive), and D (farmers market).\n5. Now, stick to fingers C and farmers market D have the word'market' in common with 'farmers market' E (indicating possible similarity).\n6. We look at the word 'fingers' in stick to fingers C and fingers C in farmers market D. Stick to fingers C refers to sticking the fingers on the jar and farmers market D refers to keeping the fingers at the market. Hence, stick to fingers and farmers markets are similar, and so D refers to farmers market E.\n7. Hence, the correct answer is, D: Farmer's Market.\nSo the final answers is D: farmer\u2019s market\n\nInput: You have one blue sock, two red socks, four grey socks, and two black socks.

{"text": "1) The question is asking us to identify 'where Jimmy might go' given that he wants a beer but his 'wife was an alcoholic'.\n2) From the provided answers:\n2.1) A neighbor's house: We can eliminate answer A(neighbor's house). An alcoholic is someone who is diagnosed with chronic alcohol use disorder. Hence, it is not possible for his wife (the alcoholic) to be living at a neighbor's house because if she were living in a neighbor's house then she would not be an alcoholic.\n2.2) A bridge: The word 'bridge' is a metaphor for solving some difficult life problem. Answer B (bridge) does not make sense, as 'bridge' is an ambiguous word in the question with multiple meanings.\n\n2.3) The home: Answer C(Home) is a vague answer and an incorrect answer, as 'home' by itself does not provide any clues to the location.\n\n2.4) A homeless shelter: Answer D (homeless shelter) is a vague answer that does not provide any context about why the person might be there. Additionally, it could be the case that Jimmy already lives in a homeless shelter.\n\n2.5) The Prison: Answer E (prison) is an ambiguous answer as it does not tell us whether Jimmy is visiting the Prison or is being sent to Prison. Furthermore, the context is not provided for Jimmy in the question.\n\n3) After eliminating all the incorrect answers, we can conclude that the correct answer is 'prison'. The reason for this is because, in the given scenario if Jimmy doesn't get a beer, it means that his wife is an alcoholic. It can't be a bridge or homeless shelter as it is not a solution for a problem. In case of a Prison, he will not get a beer as drinking alcohol in a prison is illegal. Hence, according to all the given options, we can say that the correct answer is the Prison.\nSo the final question is:  What?

A person may learn hard concepts, but the learning process does not necessarily need to be hard or challenging. Therefore, these options can be ruled out.  \n\n4) Option E (having more knowledge) indicates that learning hard concepts is simply a matter of knowing more. However, if all that a person need to learn hard concepts was to know more, it would be very easy to have students memorize all the concepts they needed for their exams, and then promptly forget everything they've learned, which does not fit the requirement of the question. \n\n5) So the only remaining option is A (intelligent).

In this context, Bob and Boris appear to be standing in a queue that may indicate they may have recently experienced a setback.  It's unclear, however, whether frustration can be a result of, or could be present even if, there aren't any setbacks.\n\nChoice B: Being annoyed indicates that a person is displeased or unhappy about something - for example annoyed by the slow-moving queue.

However, this again appears to be the wrong term as there's no mention of the queue being slow which would suggest irritation. \n\nChoice D: Delays could technically be a type of setback.

If a location is publicly owned, it may be used by anyone (even those who aren't the owners), provided that it doesn't interfere with what the owners themselves are doing. It does not require any special permission. \nStep 3: For our answer, we may use this definition as a guide. It shows that people with the means to travel to space, such as via the space shuttle in Choice C, can use it to explore the vast reaches of the universe; however, anyone is free to visit it, which is not our goal. \nThe same goes for Choice A; the Moon is certainly publicly accessible, but we're seeking a method for navigating.\nStep 4 (B): A space shuttle serves as an actual bridge between different planets in space. It is a type of space flight, which involves orbital, suborbital, and atmospheric flight. The concept of space flight had been explored and developed since John W. Campbell's short fiction \"The Black Star Passes\" was published in 1930, but it wasn't until the late 1920s and 1930s, with the first serious proposals of orbital flight from the likes of Hermann Oberth and Robert Goddard.\n\nStep 5: Space shuttle travels using rockets, propelled by the force of rocket propellant, which is a self-contained unit consisting of four main components: oxidizer, fuel, a casing, and thrust termination. The most widely used rocket propellants are liquid and solid, and the casing is typically made up of metal, plastic, or ceramics.", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

It does not say anything about what the new organization is, only that many people are talking about it. All we have is this statement: \"Many people are talking about it, so the GOAL must be telling. Is it possible to want to tell many people about your religion? Probably. Does that mean it is \"likely\"? In this case - not always. And it has nothing to do with whether you or i, personally wants to tell many about our religion. It only indicates whether \"many people\" want to do that. My guess is that they DO. But they don't WANT to. They want to talk about something else.\n\n3. I can't think of any goal for telling many people about a notorious company, except to learn about them. So, I've said \"likely\" to the 3rd choice. \n\n4. You are right that people want money when they start a new org, like many entrepreneurs are \"NOTORIOUS\" for wanting money when they start a company....\n\n5....but I guess the question also doesn't say ANYTHING about money (or learning about someone).

Likely other possibilities include getting injured, feeling hungry or laughing.\n\nChoice E, (feeling happy) could be the result of playing aggressively, depending on what game or activity is being played. But it doesn't clearly indicate a negative outcome such as feeling injured or hunger.\n\nStep 1 -Examining the structure of the question:\nThe question is asking what happens. Thus, the result can't be part of the process of playing aggressively. This means that playing aggressively will, in this case, result in a person feeling hungry or hurt.

Humans may wrestle or draw pictures, but those are not exclusive to races. \n\n5. Thus, humans may eat fruits while in a race, but the question asks for a more likely activity.\n\n6.

While it may include dog contests (which include a long list of activities, including artistic expression), it is definitely less likely than option \"eat fruit.\"\n\n8.

This could include various activities such as reading, watching movies, listening to music, traveling, or just spending time with friends. However, these do not exactly match the definition of the word entertainment given in the question. Option C (happiness) cannot be deemed as it is not a \"game\", it is the outcome of \"playing games\". (D): cheating - This refers to \"cheating\", which can include lying, deception, or stealing. However, it is not specific to people playing in games, so it can be eliminated. Similarly, option E (relaxation) can't be the answer as it is not limited to \"people playing games\".\n\nStep 2 : Therefore, we are left with Option B (entertainment) and Option C (happines). However, Option B is not the correct choice as it does not fit the definition of the word \"entertainment\".\n\nStep 3 : So, we are left with only option C (happiness). This refers to a feeling of joy or elation experienced after succeeding in a game or sport. Thus, option C (happines) is the correct answer to the question.

In a situation like that, the food  would be described as ________.  Choices:  A. digestive B. therapeutic C. nutritious D. palliative E. satisfying\nOutput: Step 4:  The question is not 'What would digestive be used to describe food when it is used to treat someone who is sick or injured?', but rather to determine what \"digestive\" would be used to describe food, when eating food makes someone feel better. \n\nStep 5: At this point, we have 3 choices remaining: (A) digestive, (C) palliative and (D) satisfying.\nStep 6:  Now consider options (A) and (D).  While (A) may be used to describe foods that are digestible, it is not necessarily helpful in describing food when 'eating food makes one feel better'. Eating food that is digestible can actually have the opposite effect and cause discomfort if there is a digestive problem, hence it is not a suitable option. Moreover, while (D) might be used to describe food as'satisfying', it does not convey that eating this food will make us feel better. \nStep 7: Therefore, we are left with (C) 'palliative', which means serving to ease the pain or discomfort of an illness, etc.  Hence, the correct answer to this question is (C): palliative.\nSo the final choice is C. Palliative\n\n\nInput:The bullfrog is the largest frog in the world.  What is the bullfrog's scientific name? Choices: A: R", "answer": "A: being for"}

A gas station is a commercial establishment that sells fuel for vehicles and other related services. So the most likely option available from a gas station, if offered, would be gas or fuel, not food. This answer doesn't answer our question, so we can reject it.\n2. 2. Gas station is still not related to food. Vegetables and fruits also aren't considered to be food, but rather plant products, and snacks are still not the correct answer. This answer also doesn't answer our original question, so we can dismiss it.\n\n3. A: This is the only non-empty choice that we can cross off because gas station isn't an answer related to food.\n\n3. B: This is the correct answer! Since the question asks for one type of food that they sell/offer at a gas station, we must conclude they they aren't just a pet store, or a drugstore or a clothing, or toy or sporting goods store.

{"text": "In answer to the question, 'the crab was scutteling but strained when he moves, what was impeding' - we must firstly determine what'scuttling' refers to. One would naturally assume this refers to the action of walking or moving like a crab. However, when we continue reading, this term changes to'scuttling but strained'. We need to note this change from scuttling to strained as the two are different actions, as seen by how'scuttling' is used as a verb, whereas'strained' is used as an adjective, indicating that it is a state rather than an action. Therefore, we deduce that scuttling is not a walking movement, but more of an active state of'scuttling'.\n\n1. The use of the term \"but strained,\" in the later part of the sentence clearly indicates that the problem does not lie in the action of walking. This further supports the view that the problem lies in some other state.\n\n2. We further see that the crab is scuttling but straining to move, indicating that the crab has trouble in moving. We conclude that scuttling indicates some kind of state or condition that the crab was in a situation he/she was trying to move away from.\n\n3. We eliminate choice (D), that current is the problem because it does not refer to any sort of state or condition. Instead, as a verb, current refers to a continuous or steady movement which does not involve any state or effort by any means.\n\n4. Another way to eliminate option (B) is the fact that the crab is moving away from being in a state or condition: the beach sand. This means that his straining effort to move involves getting away from the beach sand.\n\n5. Choices (A), (C) and (D) all refer to natural phenomena that occur outside the scope of the crab's movement. We can reject these choices because they are beyond the crab's concern and movement.\n\n6. The last possibility that might be considered is choice D which refers to a 'cooking pot.' This is clearly an artificial object with no reference to its current state and not a reference to a state of water cooking.\n\n7. Therefore, we can conclude that cooking pot is not a suitable solution to the problem.\n\n8. In conclusion, we can conclude", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

So, the answer has to be either city or subdivision. \n3) The subdivisions in the city probably do not make up the city itself (because they are a part of the city), so we are left with C city or D subdivision.  Note: If a yard was made up of city, we would have 0 yards, which is not possible.\n4) If city were correct, the question would be: How many cities are made up of city?

Therefore we can exclude option B.\n\nOption C: Potential\nThe phrase \u2018his disability wasn't physical\u2019 tells us that a physical disability is not affecting his strength, so we can safely discard this potential as being affected.\n\nOption D: Quality\nThe phrase \u201cwasn\u2019t physical and didn't affected his strength, brain pot\nential, qualit\ny or competence.\ntionality\u201d tells us that it isn't just his potential that was affected. He suffers from a physical\nity. \u2018Didn't affected\u2019 is present in parentheses, which means it was originally a part of the sentence. So we know that something also affected his competence.\n\nOption E: Competence\nThe phrase \u201chis potential, quality, or\ncompetence\" means that everything was affected, not just his strength, which could be interpreted as his brain and other parts of his body.\n\nTherefore we can conclude that the correct answer is option E Competence\nThus the final answer is E; Competence.\n\nInput:How can", "answer": "E: competence"}

To get a clearer idea about the meaning, consider that the options are presented in the form of 'what can people do?...'; so, if each of these options is in the form 'people could...', we can expect something like 'what can people do to make sure they can...'.

That could be something positive or negative, since the attitude can be either, or both, positive and negative.\n\n5)Choice D (E: feel better) is not a reference to what someone receives. Since they receive something, it has to be something that the receiver receives. And since we already know that receiving forgiveness is beneficial to the person being forgiven, the answer here could be what that person receives. The answer is not feel better, though.\n\n6)Now, consider choices A, C, E. If I have a forgiving disposition toward someone, A (B: redemption): they can receive redemption. But this does not really make sense here. The person who would be receiving redemption is already experiencing redemption as a benefit to their life (in this case through the process of forgiveness). If we were to look at what the pardoned person receives, they would not receive redemption, as it's already been provided to them. \n\nConcerning choice C (C: Absolution): What does the person being absolved receive? We're not told in this sentence. But if the point of forgiveness is to absolve someone of something - we could infer that receiving absolution is a good thing. It might not make you feel better, but absolution comes with a feeling of relief that you've been forgiven for your 'wrongdoing'. \n\nThis leaves us with Choice E (E: feel better). Feel better in this context must refer to something that the person receiving forgiveness feels after they've been forgiven.

We can therefore also rule this option out. This leaves us with college and home as two remaining possible answers.

If the hypothetical thing did exist then we would be satisfied and hence, we would not need it.\n\nStep 1: Clearly A) being satisfied implies we don't need. A is hence eliminated.\nStep 2: B) \"unnecessary\" suggests that it need not exist (i.e. we are always able to function with the thing not being there). But then that would mean we do not need it, hence it does not make sense.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, C) \"luxury\" meets the criteria as not requiring. We can say that being able to buy a luxury item shows that one has enough money such that an unnecessary item which would not impact the functioning significantly is not required.\n\nStep 6: D) \"sufficient\" can be rephrased to \"it is not required or not needed\", implying that it is not a condition in which one is satisfied and therefore does not meet criteria.\n\nStep 7: Hence, the correct answer option is C, \"luxury\".\nSo the final answeris C: luxury\n\nInput:A computer engineer was making an application for a smartphone.

Engineer\nOutput: Step 2: Let us first look at the correct answers in detail:\n\nCorrect Answer 4. Engineer : While this answer is correct, it is too general. The question demands an engineer that is specifically looking to hire for an application that allows users to download and listen offline songs. However, there are many types of engineers, hence this answer is too broad.\n\nCorrect Answer: 1. App Builder : This is the engineer for a smartphone application that builds and creates the app for offline song listening. \n\nHowever, there is one major problem: the engineer could be the one who has already created a successful mobile app and now wants to hire engineers to work on a new app. In that case, the question would require an engineer with experience.", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

Hence, Choice B (crown) should be disregarded.\n\n3. We can then eliminate Choices C (unpredictable), D (frequent), and E (eternal). Unpredictable indicates that the event is not planned in advance, hence we are left with three words that all have the same meaning: crowd, frequent, and eternal. \n\n4.

However 2: It was overloaded, cannot be true by itself as cane is not overloaded. Now, taking 1& 3 into account, a cane with obstacle can hit an object, which cannot happen when the cane is only overloaded, therefore it is not possible to capsize and hit obstruction, leaving with option 3.

{"text": "Step 0: We first want to think about what the problem really is. We are trying to get the answer of what it is called.\nWe assume that it involves using a grill to cook using a grill. We are getting closer to the problem statement with these assumptions and the idea that we are trying to get the correct name of the thing.\nStep 1: We know that it involves using a different set of words (cooking, grill) to what the question initially stated (used, a grill). It must have started by using a different set of terms so to make sure we get the correct answer. We will need to read the question carefully to find this out. It is called when you slowly cook\nStep 2: we now know that we must replace \"used\" with a verb instead. It would need to be a slow verb such as cook. It must take place using a grill but using the verb cook we can add it to a new word to produce something different. It can also be considered an item name using a descriptive word like \"cooking with a grill\" (slowly cooking?) but our initial set of assumptions (cooking using a grill) indicates that it cannot be considered a name. We know that it is slowing down the cooking time using a grill so we can use the word (slow) to combine it. Slowly cooking with a grill. Now the question becomes, how do we know if it is called this? It is called \"that's a slow burn\".\nStep 3: You can now see that if the question is trying to ask us to provide a name to describe it like \"Is the slow cooking called that?\" but then it was already called that as it is given in the answer. It does not state so the answer cannot be given in question form. If the answer was given in question form, it would have to be a question, not a name. The question form for \"that's a name for it\" would be \"What's that called?\" The question form for \"slow cooking\" is \"what's the name for that?\"\nStep 4: Now that we have a good understanding of what the question is, we can determine the answer. The answer is that it produces a small amount of smoke as it is slow to heat the food properly.\nStep 5: It is referred to as (slow cooking with a gr", "answer": "E: barbeque"}

A: The moon affects tides.  B: The moon does not affect tides.  C: The moon affects ocean currents.  D: The moon does not cause tides. E: The moon has no effects on the Earth.\nOutput: Let's go through each choice.\n\nChoice A: Tides do have an effect on the earth. This is something we are already aware of. This eliminates option A.\n\nChoice B: This means that the effect is not present on the Earth. Hence, option B does not mean that it does not affect the Earth. Therefore, option B does not fit the parameters.\n\n(i)Choice C: This means that the earth has an effect on tides and not vice versa and thus, does not answer the question.\n\nChoice D and E: Both of these choices fit the parameters and hence, we have to evaluate these as a part of answer.\n\nWe know that moon has no effects on tides but cause tides. This is wrong.\n\nWe know if tides don't have an effect on ocean currents. This means tides have an effect on ocean and thus, option D does not mean tides don't affect the Earth.

This rule outs some of the options - Osaka's climate is cooler than Tokyo in May, and Nagasaki tends to be very rainy in March.\n\n3 : \"Go on\", implies that people do this annually, meaning that there should be lots of Japanese families who have the same holiday routine.

Backery means to bake but in this question, they don't want to know which foods bake well, they're looking for the place where the meat lasts longer.\t\n\n  Step-5:\t\n\t\tB:Ham sandwich: A ham sandwich is a food item that contains ham, in the form of ham, ham salad or other mixtures, between slices of bread or a roll. So, ham sandwich is not the place where meat lasts for a long time.\n\t\t\n  Step-6:\t\n\t\tC:Fridge: A fridge is the place where you store fruits and vegetables.

A butcher shop is a retail establishment that purchases and sells halal, kosher, non-halal/non-kosher meat. It sells meat such as beef, pork, lamb, chicken, mutton, etc. Butchers in retailer shops are engaged in slaughtering, butchering, and processing of all types of meat with the help of refrigerators. As the meat at the butcher shop is fresh, it stays for a long time. That's why, butcher's shop is the right answer.\n\nSo the correct answer is D: Butcher shop", "answer": "E: freezer"}

So answer cannot be a city or a town.\nStep 07:  Rest stops/ service roads are not present on an expressway either.  Therefore, an expressway does not suffer from congestion on its own. \nStep 8:  So if the congestion is not caused by traffic, it must be caused by a separate object. \nStep 9:  We know that an expressway is a highway within a city/town, and can suffer from congestions. \nStep 10:  A traffic jam (congestion) is always caused by traffic, that traffic is often cars.\nStep 11:  Cars cannot be a separate object that an expressway itself suffers from, as an expressway isn't a separate object.\nStep 12:  So what is a car or traffic?

Dinner is typically eaten once they're home, though they may eat lunch once they're back so some people technically consume 2 meals.\n\nStep 1b: This means that the correct answer must be either dinner (answer A), lunch (answer B), or breakfast (answer C).\n\nStep 2 to 6: In order to compare the options, we should understand how each of them could be eaten in the middle of the workday (the workday starting at 12 PM and ending at 12 AM). \n\nStep 2-5: Breakfast - Usually, people do not eat breakfast until around 10 AM, so it is an unusual day that would include this time period in the middle of a workday. Therefore, it is not possible to be eating breakfast in the middle of a typical workday.\n\nStep 6: Lunch - This could be eaten between 1-7 PM, as we know that the workday can potentially start at 12 PM.

Choices:   A: at night B: on the ground C: in bed D: in daylight E: under a blanket\nOutput: 1: Daylight is not correct, as night does not come during daytime, and 'at night' seems to suggest some point in the day, as opposed to the night.\n2: In Bed is not correct as the sun does not sleep in the same sense as people, i.e., it does not occupy a bed.\n3: Under a blanket is not correct, as it should be used to define the surface upon which the sun sleeps (like 'on the ground' would be) rather than its location while it is inanimate.\n4: On The Ground is the likely answer, if it were not for the fact that it is ambiguous. It could mean 'on' the ground, e.g. in an orbit around the Earth.\n\n5: Since the sun does not sleep, neither can it be found at night.\n6: At Night is therefore not the correct answer. In doing so, 'on the ground' is then the only answer left.\n\nStep 7: The sun does not sleep, thus the answer", "answer": "D: death"}
{"text": "1) The question asks us to recall a time when we received a massage, the time the massage was made of memory, and the impact this had upon us (the word 'brought' here indicates the kind of emotional response we had, which we can infer to be either pleasure or depression, if depression it would not bring on 'pleasure', so it's not 'pleasure').\n2) There is not an \"I\" here, so option A (the first item) is clearly wrong, and we can also eliminate option B (that's in \"her\" not \"she\"). So there is no \"I\" at all in (the second item) the massage that brought (the third item) the positive emotion/impact.\n3) This leaves us with either pleasure or depression as the only possible options that make sense.\n4) Option E (Nostalgia) does not cause either, it reminds you of something you had in the past but it doesn't cause emotions.\n5) Option D (Pleasure) can be caused by a massage, but so can depression if it doesn't come with the correct type of relaxation, which could feel too good.\n6) Option C (Depression) is a potential response to the memories that would bring about good times, as it could produce a negative emotional response from thinking about those good times and comparing them to what the patient was experiencing at the time, e.g. being in hospital.\n7) So the correct answer is C: depression.\n\nSo the final answer C: Depression.", "answer": "D: pleasure"}

As we go through them individually we can say that The king of clubs is simply an alternate name for the king of spades. The king of hearts is similar to The king of spades as they are two names for the same person. As shown in the diagram, The king of clubs/ spades/ hearts is essentially the same for all of them. The king of diamode is the fourth option. The king of diamonde is the last alternate name for the king. It can be observed that all these possible answers are nothing but the same king.\n\nSo the correct answer is C: The king of hearts. \n\nInput: Which comes after turtle?

This procedure is not an option for old-time doctors as the technology was not available at the time.\nChoice B: Distance Himself - Distance between a doctor and a patient is the physical space between them. This means that a doctor would be asked to move away or be physically separated from a patient. This is not an option for the old-time doctors\nChoice C: Perform Surgery - Doctors would do surgeries by cutting and stitching the skin. This type of surgery would require an operating theater which would not be available for old-time docers.\nChoice D: Study Medicine - Study of medicine involves learning the anatomy of the body and studying the different diseases. This type of learning was also not available to the old-time docers since they did not have any books to read.\nChoice E: Let Blood - This is a type of old-time treatment where the doctor would try to remove the diseased blood by extracting it.

This also excludes choice E (score points): scoring points is one way towards achieving a goal in a game, hence it is irrelevant to the current situation.\nStep 6: The most likely answer is choice A (competition) as games can be defined as forms of competition with a set of rules that govern the course of play, and the goal of competition is to outperform one another, as seen in choice A, and the other choices eliminate other options:\n\nChoice A - The goal of competition is to compete (exclude).\nChoice B - The goal of basketball in that case is to compete (include).\nChoice C - The goal of competition in not to have fun (exclude).\n\nStep 7: With Choice A (competition), and all the other choices being eliminated with other reasoning, the only remaining choices are A (competition).", "answer": "E: score points"}

Choices: \nA: usa\nB: bahamas\nC: spain\nD: france\nE: china\nOutput: Step 3: There are other countries that have square flags. They may not be rectangular, but they will often have four corner. We start by looking at the countries that have a flag that is not rectangular.\n\nChoice B: Bahamas \u2014 Bahamas has a flag that is 60% wider than it is long. It has an X-shape.\n\nChoice C: Spain is almost a perfect rectangle. There is an extra triangle on the side of Spain's flag that's 7.5 times smaller than the length of the flag. So it's not an even ratio.\nChoice D: France has a flag that is almost a perfect rectangle but the vertical length of the flag can be more than half of its width, while the other horizontal length can be less than half - thus, the flag is not symmetric.\n\nStep 1: The flag of Cuba has two color panels, one red and the other white. As a result the area of each panel is equal, regardless of whether they are squares or rectangles. However, the flag of Cuba is rectangular.\n\nStep 0: Flag of Guinea is rectangular and the flag of Nepal is square.

This is a different issue to what the question is asking, and it is referring to the question \"What is love when no one feels it\"\n\nChoice C: It lasts forever - This is a statement of truth in the positive. We can't agree with this answer as the question's answer is \"everyone feels it\" and that's not possible when love lasts forever.\n\nChoice D. Painful - A positive statement but not in the way that the question is actually phrased. In the question, we are questioning that love will no longer exist when everyone does feel it. With this in mind, it will only be painful when someone is in pain.\n\nChoice E. Blind - This is a negative statement describing that no one can see what is actually there. This is a different interpretation of the question.\n\nAs we go through the choices we can see that they are all misinterpretations of the question, which is why we have to eliminate them.\n\nStep 6. So we are left with option C: last forever which is the only negative choice left, but is not the correct answer as it says it lasts forever, and we are actually looking to answer what it will be like when love lasts forever, so  the answer is none of the above, as this is the only correct answer.\nSo the final is C: none of the above\n\n## Solution\n\nThere are several strategies to answer these questions that I found helpful. \n\n* If a statement has an error or exception, think about what the author meant instead of what is wrong with the original statement.

{"text": "Step 2: We can eliminate choices B - Toy box, C - Playroom and E - Closet.\n\nChoice B - Toy box - A toy box would contain various toys, so it is unlikely that Billy would be in the box.\n\nChoice C - Playroom - A playroom is a dedicated space for engaging in playful activities, like playing a game with a ball, so Billy might be in the playroom. Hence, we can eliminate Choice C - Playroom.\n\nChoice E - Closet - A closet is a storage space, often used to keep clothes, so Billy might not be in the closet. Thus, we can also eliminate Choice E - Closet here.\n\nStep 1: The ball could be on a table, so Billy bouncing the ball off the wall would make him bounce with the ball in a target. Alternatively, the target could be on the wall so Billy bouncing off the wall would make it bounce in a target. Choice A could be any of the two.\n\nStep 5: Now that we have narrowed down the choices to either B or A let's examine them one by one.\n\nChoice A: \n\nChoosing A is the same as choosing the ball as it would be the object that is bouncing. The question clearly states there is a target for the ball to bounce into.\n\nSo we can eliminate choice A. Thus, we are stuck with choice B \u2013 Pool table.\n\nStep 6: The explanation now is pretty straightforward here. A pool table is a specific type of table that has holes in the middle and pockets around the sides, where balls may be rolled or bounced.

However, hotels tend to have more luxurious rooms with more amenities than motels and are typically found in populated areas with more services and attractions. Hotels may also offer other services alongside lodging, such as a restaurant and spa. The room service can use up shampoo too, but still, it's not an institution for making shampoo.\n\nChoice D. Shampoo bottle: A shampoo bottles is an item used to store and dispense shampoo. Since shampoo itself is sold separately, the shampoo bottled is not a workshop. Its only use is to store shampoo. \n\nChoice E: Hair salon: A hair salon is a place that offers various hair services such as haircuts, styling, and coloring. It might use shampoo for washing the hair, but it's certainly not a salon where shampoo is made. \n\nChoice A: Supermarket: A supermarket is essentially a large grocery store that offers a wide variety of food and household goods, usually operating on a self-service basis.

However, we know that caring for someone requires an emotional action, not a yell. Thus, we can eliminate choice D. We can also eliminate choice E: vent anger, because if the parents were trying to vent anger, it doesn't make sense that they would also yell at us at the same time, which indicates that they don't want to vent anger. They'd just want to use their yell to get their point across.\nStep 2: With A: guide children, we know that the best word to rule out is B: understand children. If the parents were trying to help their children understand, they wouldn't want to do so through yelling.\n\nChoice C: control children. We know that parents tend to yell to control us but we know that they could use other methods too.\nIf the parents were to control us, then why are they also yelling at us? They wouldn't do that.\n\nChoice E CAN be the correct answer because it's only one of two choices left\n\nSo we know that Parents often yell in chaotic situations to guide us, but choice C seems really unlikely for the following reasons: yelling is not the preferred method for controlling us, and they can control us using other means.\n\nChoice E, which is venting anger, is a legitimate choice.

Stories in beauty salons are unrelated to a mall, so this choice doesn't fit. \n\nChoice \"C\" (salon) is a type of shop or business offering skincare and beauty treatments, and can be found at a beauty salon because it is the main activity that takes place at these places. So, it fits as an answer as it describes what a typical day is like in a beauty parlor which sells salon services. \n\nChoice 'D': Beauty parlor is a related term to salon, so it does not count as a specific answer. \n\nChoice'E': Beauty salon may be a term that is often used interchangeably with salon, but it is important to note that these two terms are not synonymous. A beauty salon is a place where people may undergo beauty treatments such as haircuts, makeup, and nail care.

You can't hold a cell phone while it is running low on battery because you will not be able to get any coverage when you're calling or texting or any phone services.\nChoice C: If the president is holding a camera or not, you cannot take a picture of the President while his phone is running out of battery because he needs a phone that has coverage for phone services.\nChoice D: This is the correct answer.

The boat has a helm but it is the wrong category to choose.\nStep 3: Since, there are no other options left to consider, we will go with C: Ship. Moving the masts is the only thing we know the helm does, and this is why we were trying to determine the location of the helm. In order to move the masts, it must be on a kind of boat that carries them. That leaves us with the ship. We will therefore put our answer to the helm being on the ship.\nStep 4: When we ask for the helm\u2019s current location, the boat is given as a helm. This means that we should now infer that this helm is on a ship. But, ship is a subcategory of the boat category. \nStep 4: \nChoice B: Paddled Boat The helm moves the masts for a ship, but not a paddleboat, so paddleboat must not be the correct answer. \nChoice D: Sailboat (1) The helm moving the masts is not a sufficient condition for a sailboat to exist.

Choices A and C seem to make the most sense because we know that the book started in a library. However we know it isn't in the library, this means we know it can't be a library book.\n\nWe can eliminate choices D and E because the church and cemetary don't have the same meaning. (Choice D \"the church\" does not necessarily refer to church as a house of worship- we do not know). The cemetary and church choices are the exact same.\n\nChoice F is not a logical choice because the book is never in the library again.\n\nChoice G can be eliminated for the following reasons:\n1) There are no options that could be the entire cemetery- the church is a location. \n2) The church doesn't always have books- if there was a library within the church we wouldn't be able to get rid of choice E.\n\nThis leaves choice B and G.\n\nStep 1: We know that it is in the cemetary at some point.

As such, Choices D and E (construction on the highway) can be eliminated as they cannot be compared with the new road construction.\n\n2.) Consider Choice C (road was closed for repair).

As mentioned earlier, we can also eliminate option C since the question asks for something related to a \"hockey game\", and hockey games do not tend to be particularly noisy.\nStep 3: 1. The remaining three options all contain the word \"game\", which is a type of activity \u2013 we will continue by reading the options and eliminating anything that contains the word \"sport\", which is a broad catch-all category that does not have a single specific form.\n\nChoice A: The words \"show\" and \"game\" indicate that it is not something related to movies or a hockey game, so we can disregard these.\nChoice B: \"Theatre\" contains the word \"play\", but the question is not asking for something related to plays, so it is also not an acceptable choice\n\nStep 4. 2. Choices A & B can therefore be eliminated, as they do not contain sports, which is the type of activity the question is asking about.\n\nStep 5: 3.

By this logic, option E (Control) is definitely not correct.\n5 - As everything in the universe is controlled by a bigger mass (i.e. the sun), the only thing which remains uncontrolled is the government. Hence, the only choice that makes sense is C: City.

Choices: . A: Comma  B: Period C: Full Stop D: Space  E: Question Mark\nOutput: 1: A period isn't considered a sentence part, as it marks the end of the sentence.\n2: Similarly, a question mark, full stop, comma and a space are not sentence parts as they are all punctuation marks that indicate the end of a sentence.\n3: A space is always used in a sentence and is not sentence part. \n4: A sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop or a question mark.\n5: A question mark is always at the end of the sentence, but the words \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019 can function as a sentence by themselves.

However, it is not the most common usage of the term, and may not be the intended meaning of the question.\n\nChoice A: Order means a request for something in a shop or restaurant, but it is not what the question is asking here, as the queue is stuck and people cannot get what they need as they cannot be served.\n\nChoice D and E are both associated with queues or the act of waiting in them, so we eliminate choice and move to another question.\n\n3.) If we look further at what the question is asking for, we can see that it is asking how one might feel when they are standing or waiting in line and the queue isn't moving, therefore, we can rule out choice B - queueing.\n\nChoice D tells us that wait turn might be the feeling the person would have if they were waiting one's turn, but as we stated earlier, wait turn is not synonymous with the intention of the question.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: wait turn.\n\nSo the final answer we get is D: wait turn\n\nInput: Which one of following is not a unit of pressure?

{"text": "1) The question asks about storing dirt in a home.\n\n2) We can eliminate A (fingernails) from our answer choices because dirt is not something that could be put in fingernails. This is because fingernails are made of keratin (a hard protein that makes up skin and hair) and dirt is not able to be put in them.\n\n3) Similarly, we can eliminate choice B (garden) from our answer choices as dirt stored in a garden makes it much more difficult to take care of plants in the garden, and dirt may increase weed growth. \n\n4) Choice C (corner) is not an appropriate answer choice as corners tend to collect water, which can result in mold growth and create a health hazard.\n\n5) If I wanted to store dish dirt in a home, I would likely use choice D (closet).\n\n6) Therefore, the correct answer to this question is choice E (closet).\nSo the final answer in the input is: E: closet\n\nInput: What can you drink which is good for you but can also cause death? Choices: A: beer E: water\nOutput: The question can be restated as, \"What beverage, which is beneficial to you, will most likely cause your death?\" This allows us to narrow our search for the most likely answer.  So we look at the choices.\nStep 1: The information provided reveals that the beverage is not milk or alcohol, nor the juice of an orange. Therefore, we can eliminate choices C and B.\nStep 2: It can be concluded that the beverage is water. It has many health benefits, such as improving hydration levels, but it can also cause death by drowning, as drowning is the process of dying from not being able to breathe due to immersion in liquids. \nStep 3: Therefore, choice E, water, is the most likely answer.\nSo the final is E: water\n\nInput: Which of these 2 cities is east of the city of Toronto?

Choices:  A. Shreds its hair B. Swallows it whole C. Pets it on the head D. Sticks it to a wall E. Sticks to a tree\nOutput: A: the question is asking what a dog does that a cat does not but we have three cats in the list of choices so if we take the question as literal (i.e. what does a dog do that the other choices don't do) then the likely choices to eliminate are B and C because no matter what other things that they did they must both still be doing the main task otherwise the question is meaningless.\n\nB: Shredding its hair cannot be correct as dogs don't have very much hair.\n\nC: Swallows it whole cannot be correct because not all snakes can be swallowed whole so, in that sense, swallowing it whole must be correct.\n\nD: Pets it on the Head is not correct as pets are what you keep as a pet and snakes do not make good pets. They also do not normally hang out on your head as a cat would.\n\nE: sticks it to a wall is also not correct because, while snakes can be stuck up a wall, dogs would never do it so this answer is not correct.\n\nSo the answer must be E: Sticks to a tree.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThe task of building a NLP system for multiple choice questions seems quite straight forward at first, but it is more complex than it appears. The difficulty arises in the definition of the question and in the design of the data. If you design a question whose output is a single entity only (e.g. \"Which car would you rather drive\") it can be relatively straightforward for the NLP algorithm to find the correct one.

Choices:  One: I - Ten: X - One thousand: I - 10,000: M - Ten million: C - 100 thousand: D - One million: M - Ten million :C - 100k :D - _______\nOutput: What we have to do is to translate the Roman numerals I, X, C, D into their decimal values to determine the values of M and 10,050. It is clear that one is I which equals to 1, 10 is X and equals to 10, 1000 is M, and 10,500 is C.

{"text": "Step 2: From the choices provided, we can deduce that the answer will come under choices A (zoo) and C (hospital), as they are both places where people would encounter/view various animals.\n\nStep 1: The original question was, \"what place would a person go...?\", which means that the only places we would be looking at is the 'place', which will eliminate choices E and B (opera, hospital). This leaves us with 3 choices.\n\nStep 6: \"At the same time the zebras are there as well\". Here we can deduce that there will always be zebras, as the question specifically mentions them. This means that they cannot be the 'place' as it will have 'zebras' in it, which will eliminate choices A and E (zoo and opera). This leaves us with B and D (museum or desk).\n\nStep 4 : We can deduce that looking at a zebra would be something that is 'enjoyed to a slight extent', as we can infer from the context of the rest of the sentence, that this would be a common experience for someone. 'enjoyed to an obvious extent' would imply that the experience is quite enjoyable and the person would be looking forward to it, which would be uncommon. This eliminates the choices of D, C and B (desk, hospital, museum). This leaves us with the final answer of A: zoo.\n\nSo the final answer choice is A: zoo\n\nInput: To which of the following would you most likely apply a wrench?

{"text": "Starting with the last line, we want to find out the last thing a salesman did. So, the last 3 letters are: MAN.

According to the definition of downtown, when a salesman goes downtown, it means that he goes into downtown for shopping, not that he has scared everyone by his scream.\n\nStep 1: When a salesman bottoms out, it doesn't mean that he goes out of line. So, Salesman does not go out of line on his own.\n\nStep 5 - Appear suddenly. When a salesman appears suddenly, it means he appears suddenly. Salesman doesn't appear suddenly.\n\nStep 6 - Roll over. It has an inverted position (i.e., car bottoms down and the top of car is called the roof). Salesman doesn't inverts.\n\nStep 7 - Go downtown -> When a salesman, who appears and bottoms out suddenly but doesn't invert, goes downtown, he screams his lung out.\n\nSo the final answer would be Downtown: Going downtown, he goes into downtone.

{"text": "1). The sentence itself provides some clues of the answer. The word \"trust\" and \"polite\" are synonymous. \"Trust\" could mean a number of things, as for example being honest, reliable and not lying. We could eliminate some synonyms from choice list. As, \"beautiful\" means a woman as \"deceive\" is not something that we can use to gain someone's trust. Also, \"exaggerate\" is not something which is done in order to gain trust. So our options are A: polite B: charming C : delightful\n2). The question is clear and concise.\n3). The question says that the agent was polite in order to gain someone's \"trust\". \"Delightful\" is what describes a person being trustworthy. When we are polite to someone, that person tends to respond by being happy with us and so we are able to build up a trust on him/her.

Maybe he's scared that he'll be sacrificed in a cult so he doesn't end up eaten, but he's scared the cult won't have a sacrifice for him to be in?  That's a big maybe.

While Choice B (ground) does not make it into the terrain type which best produces a splash in rivers, it is not incorrect in terms of the question as the rock will make a splash once it hits the ground or water. This option does not directly answer the prompt about making a big splash, but it is important to include if you are trying to make the best choice.\n\n6. Choice C (bridge) may initially appear to be the best option because it is a raised terrain type which would create a splash when a rock is thrown into or underneath it.  Indeed, if the rocks dropped into the water far below a bridge, they would make a splash, but the river is located in the countryside, so there would not be enough water below a bridge to create a big splash, and therefore, it is not an appropriate response.\n\nStep 8: As a result of careful consideration of the question and the choices, we can confirm that A (mountain countryside) and D (mountains range) are the only two choices that are correct.\n\nStep 9", "answer": "C: bridge"}

Hence, we will eliminate options 1 (notoriety), 2 (emotional distress), and 3 (annoyance).\n\nStep 3:'Riot' is a potentially violent display of disproportionate emotional protest aimed at making your voice heard, but it is a serious reaction that cannot be easily related to telling people about an embarrassment. \nSo we are left with options C (bad dreams) and D (bad dreams).\n\nStep 4:'Bad dreams' mean vivid, frightening, or unusual dreams causing feelings of anxiety and distress the next day. It was not a serious reaction to an incident, it is not a violent reaction. \nThey can be the outcome after one night or even months, and so it fits perfectly with the statement of 'telling people about an awkward situation' by explaining that such things can be experienced the morning after embarrassingly. It therefore leads us to answer B (bad dreams)\n\nSo the final answer should be B: bad dreams\n\nInput: What is the best place to visit at night to see the full galaxy? Choices: 1. A: Alaska 2.

That's pretty much equivalent to someone who spends a lot to live in a downtown area.\n\nChoice C: building is a good answer if we're referring to the specific building of a garage. This answer would be correct for buildings that James has and wants to save, like his house or apartment building, or a new house he had previously.

Choices:  a: No i would need to exercise b: If i didn't make dinner c: I wouldn't be able to sleep d: No i would feel sick  e: Yes i would be gaining weight \nOutput: Step 2: The question is asking for an action that would occur if you ate those three large pepperoni pizzas for lunch and dinner.\n\nChoice A: I would need to exercise: If we eat too much food, we may need to exercise to maintain our health. However, the question does not ask us for an activity that we need to do after overeating.\n\nChoice B: If I didn't make dinner, I would be hungrier. This is incorrect as the question asks about the consequence of eating a large pepperoni pizza and not the consequence of not making dinner.\n\nChoice C: I wouldn't sleep: Eating too much food may lead to indigestion and disrupt our sleep patterns if we are unable to rest properly, but it doesn't explicitly say that you wouldn't be able sleep, so it cannot be a correct answer. \n\nChoice D: No I wouldn't be sick: If we eat too many pepperoni pizzab, we may feel nauseous, but the question does not ask for a consequence that would make us sick. \n\n\nChoice E: Yes, I would gain weight: Overeating can lead to", "answer": "D: parking garage"}

The question mentions that tickets would help us, which implies that we require one to get to another country.\n\nSince our choices only involve travel within the country, we can also discard these choices by eliminating the ones like train station, which involve travel within a country.\n\nWe are left with only four choices! Let us start by examining choices E (bus) and C (lottery). The question specifically mentions a ticket, and buses require tickets for travel. However, lotteries are games of chance and do not necessarily involve travel.\n\nNow looking at choices A (train station) and E (lottery) we see that they involve travel, and could allow us to travel to a different country by providing us with a ticket. Trains are not mentioned specifically and do not guarantee that the travel will lead us to a different country. It is not logical to eliminate choice E (train station) as it is not the only travel method on the list.\nTherefore the correct answer is E: bus\nSo the final answer  is E: bus\n\nInput: Where would you see signs outside to make a store known as a thrift store? Choices:  Thrift stores A: inexpensive B: good C: quality D: cheap E: used\nOutput: 1) Since the question is asking where to see the sign to the right we would eliminate choices A (in a movie theatre) and D (at a hotel).\n2) In thrift shops we see signs that say \u201cThrift\u201d or \u201cThrift shop\u201d often these are outdoor.

In this case, the context suggests that the person is helping other people. \n\nChoice E: Nurse is a person who cares for the sick or infirm, such as by monitoring progress and administering treatment. In this case, it is also about helping people and thus does not fit the description of the term.\n\nChoice A: social worker is a person responsible for helping people who have social problems or disabilities. Such a person could help the sick and the disabled. Thus, it fits the description. \nChoice B: B babysitter is a person hired to care for children while their parents are away, but the context in which the question is asking is not about childcare, rather the help of people in general. So we can ignore this option. \nChoice C: Coach is an instructor who helps people who are taking part in an activity, such as sports or other games, and the help is not necessarily required while the sick or the disabled.

(Motel, locker room, bathroom, and a room on the seashore) \n4) Since a motel room does not necessarily have a shower, we can eliminate this option.\n5) The last option (bathroom), would refer to a \"room that contains a bath (a large bath with a sink and one or more basins, a toilet bowl, a flush toilet, a bath or shower, and an ewer for washing).\" So this does not answer the question since the question asks for an amenity that is expected to be found in a given room, not necessarily within the room itself. We can thus eliminate this option\n\n6) We are left with our remaining option, A or B. \n7) An amenity refers to \"something provided for comfort or convenience in a particular location.\" These four choices would therefore be expected to be found in the given room. \n8) The only choice that does not specify exactly what type of facility or amenity it is, is the one that says \"shower.\" \n9) Therefore we can conclude that a shower is what would be expected to be found when you book a hotel.

This option describes a place rather than an object.  Therefore the rosebush could not be stored in a place called \"large hole in the ground\", but rather in the space that the large hole provides for storage.\".

However, the question specifies \"likely to live,\" meaning the location should be frequent. While veldt may be considered a habitat for lions, it is not their preferred or frequent habitat.\n4) For the same reason, the ocean cannot be the preferred or frequent habitat of lions.\n5) Africa is home to a significant portion of the world's lions and is thus a common place to encounter lions, however, it is not a frequent or preferred habitat for lions.\n6) Lions have been seen in the jungles of Kenya in the past, however, their preferred and frequent habitat remains grasslands and savannahs.\n7) Thus, the best location to likely encounter lions is a savannah.\nSo the final decision is A: savannah.\nInput:Where does a lion likely hunt?

(E) is wrong\n\nA: The answer seems to be A, as it is a city, but North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina is the location of the city, while the Carolina's is more likely to refer to the state of North and South Carolina. But this was not clarified by the author and that is fine, since the question does not ask the city to be the location of the blowfish, and thus could be anything in North Carolina.\n\nIf Carolina's was referring to the city that is located within the state of North Carolina, as the Carolina's is the name of one of the many states in America, the answer is C Carolina's: a rock band.\n\nSo the final answer was C: Carolina's: a Rock band", "answer": "E: atlantic ocean"}

{"text": "1. The referee called a holding penalty on the defence. The defender left the penalty box. Where did they go? Choices:  a: hockey game B: the penalty box C: the dressing room D: the locker room E: the dressing room.\nOutput: Step 2: Answering questions in a logical way is one of the main objectives in logic. Start by eliminating choices that are irrelevant.\n\nStep 1: The question wants to know where the person had to go downstairs to get a tool. \n\nStep 2a: In hockey players can go to the penalty box as punishment for breaking the rules of the game. They are not going there to get something that they lost, they are being punished. They do not go to the penalty box to get a tool. Similarly, in the real world, players can be put in the penalty box in a penitentiary because they committed a crime, however, in this question there is no criminal background. So option B does not really describe what the question wants, it is related but does not fit this specific question as clearly as the other choices. \n\nStep3 a: Going to the dressing room can be a way to get a hockey player in a game.  Similarly going to the dressing room in real life can be a way to have personal space or a way of leaving a room or a space. They do not go so they can get something. They only go for personal needs or as a punishment, thus they only go to the dressing room to get dressed or just to be in a space.\n\nStep 6: If the player leaves the penalty box, it can be for a referee to show them a penalty card when they broke the rules of the game, however in the real world, a judge can show you the room where they will put you or send you if you broke a rule.  So the player does not always go to the penitentiary, they can go to the place where they will be after leaving the penalty box. However the question requires them to walk down the stairs, so we can eliminate this answer because there is no reason a judge would make them walk down the stairs to get a tool or a book.\n\nStep 7: In the penalty box a hockey player does not sleep, they are there as punishment. We eliminate answer E because the people in the penalty box are", "answer": "B: basement"}
{"text": "Step 0: The question is asking about the source of information for people on the subject of the world.\n\nStep 1: Start with the choices given.\n\nOption A - Choice A 'book' - is a medium of transmission of written works. Typically, books are read by the reader and contain knowledge about the world.\n\nHowever, not everything a person reads in a book is about the world in the sense they are talking about in their question here. A dictionary or other reference book for example, does not describe the world, but rather provides information about the use of words.\nTherefore, we can eliminate choice A.\n\nOption B - Choice B'meeting' - implies a direct interaction between people instead of indirect (books) or uni-directional (television) transmission. A meeting involves discussing what one or more people know about a topic in their field of expertise.\n\nHowever, a meeting may be limited to a particular topic of discussion and may not be in itself a source of information about the world.\nTherefore, a meeting can only be considered as a source of information about a specific narrow field of knowledge. Furthermore, meetings can occur in person or on a video conference. Both of these are not required for a meeting to be considered a source of information. If the meeting is on a video conference, it's not a meeting, in the same way that if it is on the phone, it is not a face-to-face meeting.\nTherefore, an online meeting is not a source of information about world.\nWe can therefore conclude that a Meeting is not a 'traditional' source of knowledge about the world and so we can eliminate choice B.\n\nOption C - Choice C is 'television'. It contains moving images. It can be used for communication via broadcast, where a fixed audience views a transmission with one-way flow of messages from the television broadcaster to its audience. When there is a second-screen, like a phone or tablet, or a TV viewer is actively participating in an online community about a TV show, the traditional meaning of 'television' becomes somewhat diluted. The question asks 'traditional'.\nTherefore, we cannot assume that television is the same as it was thirty years ago when the question was asked: we cannot make assumptions about the 'traditional' sense for the question.\nWe can also assume that TV is", "answer": "E: newspaper"}

Some lizards prefer warm, sunny climates (usually deserts or rocky areas). They may prefer to hide in shadier areas during the hottest part of the day instead of being directly exposed to the sunlight.\n\nOverall, given the information in this question, the lizards would be seen on rocks or desert, and in this case, the 'bushes' would not be considered.\n\nSo the final answer \nis B:desserts", "answer": "E: rocks"}

We need to identify how George ruined the surprise.\n\nStep 1: The choices presented are: \n\nChoice B suggests an accident: Accidentally means to do something in an unintentional way, so this would not indicate how George could ruin the surprise as ruining the surprise is assumed to be done in an intentional way. \n\nSo we can eliminate Choice B from the choices.\n\nChoice C implies George's failure to meet the expectation. We can discount this, as the question does not specifically refer to expectations, but about surprises. \n\nChoice D hints at that George knew about the surprise and ruined it.  This is likely the correct answer. \n\nChoice A proposes that George hid the surprise from everyone in order to ruin it. Hiding it would still be considered an accident and therefore would not answer the question. \nChoice E would mean that George planned to surprise people, but did not follow through.\n\nTherefore, it's Choice D: knowingly.

Sometimes, the right answer will be the only option which could remain possible, if all the other choices are excluded.\n\nStep 1: The wording of the question suggests that the circus monkey is performing, and thus is probably an animal, and so we can eliminate option A (the french government) immediately.\nStep 2: Eliminations of choice B (a friend's house) and choice D (south africa) make us consider C (the zoo) more - the phrase 'the circus' can have a specific and narrow meaning, and perhaps the conductor was not referring to the zoo.\nStep 3: Choice E (madagascar) looks like a plausible option - it is a monkey 'country', however we can further narrow down our choices by noting that the question has an initial verb (waived), which indicates a sign of some kind. If we consider the other possibility, then madagascar would be the correct answer, but a flag of a country would indicate a sign, and so the conductor's joke would not be funny.\n\nStep 5: Therefore the answer has to be choice E (madagascar).\nSo the final answer\nis E: madagascar", "answer": "A: french government"}

Thus, fear cannot be the answer either.\n\nStep 1: Step 1: We know that people who are seeing new things must feel 'excited'. Thus, our options are reduced to choices B: Excitement and C: Boredom.\n\nOutput: The remaining options are excitement and boredom. Our options left are choices B: Excited and C: Bored. However, we note that if they feel Bored, it would mean to not be interested. Since they are seeing new things, boredom isn't it right answer.\n\nThus, excitement is the answer since \"excitement\" refers to be enthusiastic about experiencing something new and unexpected.\n\nSo the final answer would be B: excitement.\n\nInput:Which of the following does not have a name ending in ed?

The only option here that does not have a name that ends with ED is table. Thus, the correct answer is table, since option table doesn\u2019t ends with the suffixed word EDITED as other options.\n\n1. The answer is not bed. Bed is a piece of furniture to sleep.\n\n2. The answer is not doll. We can't say that doll is not", "answer": "A: curiosity"}

Although the question is asking about the structure of the human body, it is clear that it is being asked about the lips.\n\n2: The choices have been given are:\n\nChoice A: Mouth. Mouths are structures within the human body that have a variety of functions and are associated with a wide variety of other body parts. Someone could have a mouth and not have lips, so this cannot be correct.\n\nChoice B: Jars and all faces. This refers to the facial features of a jar or face (such as its eyes, nose, etc). The question is clearly asking about a particular structure of the body, and does not refer to any facial features. Thus this cannot be the correct answer. \n\nChoice D: Hand. Lips can be found on a hand and hands can be associated with mouths, however, the question is asking about lips specifically. Thus, this cannot be the correct response.\n\nChoice E is human. If a human had no mouth, all other body parts would no longer exist. This is impossible, therefore the question can be ruled out immediately.\n\nTherefore, it leaves us with Choice C: KFC. KFC is an abbreviation for \"Kentucky Fried Chicken.\" The question refers to a particular structure on the body, and the answer provided is a particular structure on the face, and these are both names of real structures in the world.

So we would eliminate any answer that starts with A. We can also see that there are at least three letters of the alphabet in this question/answer choices and not an exception of'setting B'. As this is a coding question we can notice that we will need to get our answer the the answer in Java, so we can eliminate A (pinger) and B (Blink).\n\nStep 3.

{"text": "1) We start by breaking the question down into components to make it more easily digestible and understandable.\n\nStep 1: We have to answer the question \"Why would a company be \"going\" public?\"\n\nStep 2 (examining the choices): \n\nChoice A: Revealing information is a valid reason, but we need more context as it could be related to a myriad of situations and is not specific enough in this case. \n\nChoice D: More funding would not be a valid reason to explain why a company \"goes public\" since the answer must be provided in a broad sense. \n\nChoice E: Telling all refers to a specific kind of action that would not be the main reason for \"going public\". Therefore, it can be eliminated. \n\nStep 3 (now having eliminated 2/5 choices, we have reached step 2): \n\nChoice B is related to being involved in the stock market as we can see from the first sentence of the passage, hence it is a valid reason. We do not need to investigate Choice C (Problems) as this also refers to something that could be related to being involved in public-share companies and we have no information to prove or disprove it. \n\nStep4: Reaching step 3 of the analysis process, only two remaining choices are left: being ridicuLED or revealing information. \n\nStep5: The answer lies with the context of the passage, where the company is seeking to go public in the stock market after being criticized by analysts in the past. This information indicates that revealing information is a valid answer. \n\nSo the final answer (after eliminating the irrelevant choices) is that the right answer is revealed information.\nSo the final Answer is A1: revealing information\n\nInput: What was the point in \"The Grapes of Wrath\" where we see the Joad family get rid of useless and broken belongings?

{"text": "1 - The question is asking where someone would go to purchase deodorant (as opposed to using their own or borrowing it).\n\n2. We can eliminate options B (medicine chest) and E (kitchen). The'medicine chest' is a small cupboard that keeps medicine, such as bandages or aspirin. In this case we don't know if you need deodorant as part of your regular medication or how often you would need to buy it, so it is not useful in answering the question. The kitchen is a place that you may find deodorant in, but it is not where people usually go to purchase it.\n\n3. Option A (medicine cabinet) is a cupboard in a bathroom where people may use or store medicine. We can rule it out as we don't know whether or not this is where the person would normally buy deodorant.\n\n4. Option C (armpits) is a physical location, so not useful in answering the broader question.\n\n5. Option D (Grocery Store) is a place you would go to buy food. While similar to the actual action of the question, this is the answer only for a person who would ordinarily buy their deodorant from such a store. (For example, some people buy their food at a grocery store and some people buy their food from a grocery store.)\n\n6.

{"text": "1) Since the question mentions that the person is a single person, we can eliminate Options A (restorand) and C (church basement).\n\n2) The question is very specific about the person being at a party, and the church basement is not a party so we eliminate it.\n\n3) The question mentions the person sitting at the center table, and there is no center table in the corridor so we eliminate it. \n\n4) The question mentions the center table, so there's a possibility it is a table that is at the center of the place of gathering. Also, in the context of the question, the person is at a party, so \"restaurants\" that serve meals are not present.\n\n5) To find the correct answer, we must compare options A, B and E and come up with something that fits the given criterion. As it stands, B and E seem to be the correct choice based on what is given. \n\n6) Option B states that the person is at a \"wedding party\" and wedding parties do indeed have center tables.

The question is specifically asking for \u2018train direction\u2019, not \u2018plane direction\u2019. Therefore, (C) uphill and (D) downhill must be ruled out as incorrect answers.\n\nStep 6: We know that train direction is either left or right. The question mentions travel in both uphill and downhill. If the train direction is right, then the train direction must be uphill as well.

Also, there is no way a person can excrete right after he or she's had sex. \n \nSo the correct answer is C- Make mistakes which won't really require the legs to tire.\nSo the final answers are C- Make mistakes. \n\nInput: Which part of the body is involved in the human eye? Choices:  a: the hands b: the leg c: the arm d: the nose e: the neck f: the shoulder \nOutput:\nStep 1: Consider the options given in the question. \nb) Since it says that the human eye is part of the human body then leg should not be chosen, so we can discard it. \nc) The arm might get involved in the functioning but cannot be the answer. \na) Since it is a part of the human body and it is not mentioned then hand should not be selected. \nf) Neck is not a part of the body then it cannot be selected.\n\nSteps 3: So we are left with only one option (d) the nose. \n\nWe can't see our nose but we can see with our eyes with which we use the nose as a filter. \nThus, we can select option D- the nose. \nThus the final answer is (d)- the nose.\n\nInput: In what country would humans live in 100 yrs from now?

{"text": "1. The question gives us some valuable clues. First, the fact that small grapes can be used either alone or combined with other fruits to make juice or produce a fruit cocktail indicates that they are probably an ingredient in other foods, not a whole food in their own right. \n2. The question also tells us that large or \"jumbo\" grapes are not used in any of these foods. Since large grapes don't fit the criteria, they can be eliminated. \n3. A picnic basket is a container for bringing food outdoors and therefore is an unlikely place to keep grapes once they have been prepared. \n4. A wine press is an implement used in winemaking to extract the juice from crushed or pressed grapes. Since not every winemaking procedure requires the entire grape to be used, grapes are also unlikely to be found in a wine press.\n5. Finally, the choices given only apply to food products that contain fruit, either fresh or preserved: food cocktails and juices do, and wine does not because wine is a beverage and not a food. This means that the answer must be either a fruit cocktail or a juice.\n6. Furthermore, as the question implies, small grapes are used to make both fruit cocktails and grape juices. \n7. Therefore, we can eliminate \"fruit cocktail\" as an option by process of elimination. \n8. Therefore the final answer is \"juice.\"\nSo the final answer to the question \"Where are small grap es used\" is B: Juice\n\nInput: What did the man buy at the market: A : a ham B: a pig C: a pork D: a bacon E: a piglet\nOutput:\n1) The question implies that the man bought something at the market.\n2) The only answer options presented that are inanimate objects that seem to be made from pig, and nothing else, are Choices: pig, pork, and bacon. \n3) Choice \"bacon\" is a meat product and therefore not really the same as the other three options, but the other three are all kinds of pork, so Choice B: a pig seems like a reasonable answer.\n4)", "answer": "B: wine press"}
{"text": "Step 2: Start by eliminating options that are not likely, based on the information provided. \nIn the question, there is a mention of popcorn, cotten candy, and grass. These are all likely to be present at a fairground or state park. On the other hand, cotton candy and popcorn are not likely to be present in a country side, a soccer game, or a movie theatre. \nOption C: Movie theatre- the movie theatre is not likely to contain grass on the floor, nor will the movie theatre likely have such fairground-y foods. \nOption D: Country side- the country side is not likely to have such delicious fairground foods, nor will it have popcorn and cotton candy. Moreover, there is no mention of sports such as soccer, nor is there likely to be a fairground.\nOption E: State Park- The information provided points to fairground-style food and grass. So, state parks containing a grassy field and cotton candy and other fairground-style food are the best bet.\nStep 3: Step 3: Exclude the remaining options by determining whether the question contains any clues that point towards the correct answer.\nIn the question, cotton candy (fairground-y food) is mentioned and so a state park is a prime place to be. Moreover, there is also a mention of grass and so state parks with grassy fields (like fields used for soccer) would be a good place to be.\nTherefore, the correct option for the question is state park.\nSo the correct answer is D: state park", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}

Thus, the question is asking which choice should a bean bag chair be paired with.\n6) Choice A: House is the most general, and would provide the best possible answer. Since house is a building consisting of a roof covered with one or more floors for living or working, the bean bag chair would be best situated in the den, the family room, or even the living room since all three spaces would be indoors, and each of these rooms would feature a floor.

In this case, the word 'pirate' is italicized which implies that we should interpret it differently from regular usage, for example instead of a pirate we should interpret a pirate (person who robs on the sea). 2: If we look at the whole problem closely, we can see that the question is asking us for the best time to be pirate. But it is not clearly stating that the question requires to find the best time to rob on the sea. Because, I don't think the problem statement is true. 3: We can see the question is not giving us the information to be rob on the sea.

We're comparing \"business restaurant\" and \"business-sector\" to \"town\", \"mall\" and \"hotel\" to \"town\".\n\nStep 7: We look to the definition of \"business-sectors\".\nBusiness sector - \"an economic sector comprising industrial or commercial establishments, such as corporations, factories, or agencies.\" \"Hotel\" is not a type of corporation in the context of \"hotel\", nor is it related to factories or agencies. \"Business-sector\" must not be the correct answer. Similarly \"mall\", \"town\" are not \"industrial or commercial establishment\". Only a restaurant can be considered as an \"industrial or commercial establishments\" in the given context. \"Business restaurant\" is an exact synonym to \"a place where\" and \"a business lunch\" is \"a place where people will go for a business lunch\". We already know that \"business sector(or business restaurant)\" is located \"a place where\" business lunch is done.

This means option C's 'expansion' cannot be correct as no such physical action is mentioned.\n\n3) In any case, the option 'expansion' does not mean the same in the context of the question. Expansion can be the physical action, i.e., cooling down too quickly, or could refer to a metaphorical meaning to 'grow' or 'expand', to which the option C would match the 'grow too quickly' sense. However, option C's 'grow' would be the wrong answer here as we are referring to his physical body cooling off.\n\n4) This leaves us with the choice D's'relaxation'. This answers the second part by providing a way for James to slow down his physical body. Relaxation can mean the action of physically relaxing, or it can serve as a metaphorical term to cool down a person mentally, and the question does not require us to look for only the literal meaning so we could rule the other option on that ground.\n\n5) Thus, we can conclude that James would die if he didn \nnot find some way to stop his rush i.e., his cooling off too quickly, and relax i.e. his body cooling down too quickly.

As for E (doctors' office), although \"a doctor's\" office may occasionally contract the illness the question refers to, it is unlikely to be the main source of the illness and so it is insufficient to be the answer.\n6. We are therefore left with choice A (hospital), as a sick patient could more likely contract the illness inside a hospital.\n7.

Three fall off. Now there are X appples.\"\n\nStep 2 : So what we've got here is what's called a 'narrative'.

While it could be construed in multiple ways, the implication is not something clearly inappropriate.\n\n- Choise E: The answer is gravity. The question is asking us to identify the type of sentence structure, and the answer is to be found in the structure itself.\n\n- The narrative is in simple past tense: \"There  were 10 apples\" and not \"There  are 10 appels\" which is in present tense. It is this simple past tense that causes this kind of sentence to be a mathematical or a counting problem.\n\n- \"There  are  X apples.\" is in present tense which clearly implies that there are more than 10 apples hence we can eliminate A, B, and D.\n\n- \"Three  fall off\" could be a number or a fraction, but the question doesn't say it should be interpreted as a fraction, hence we can eliminate E as well.", "answer": "D: math problem"}

If we examine options, we can identify that the person who lacks immortal is mortal, which is the same as not dying forever.

Option C: Dead is ruled out since someone who is dead doesn't necessarily lack immortality.

Examining the place choices:  A: Indiana is neither an animal nor a region nor a specific town through which the window is facing. So we can eliminate this one.  B: England is a region, however we do know that he is in a cabin with a window through which the fox is seen. So this is eliminated as well.  D: Wall (through which) is a wrong choice. So is E: window (on which). This is a classic case of a misdirecting word. We know that we've been provided with an image of a fox at a window; however, we don't know where the window is. Now, we have to check the region choices:  C: Outside might indicate that the fox is outside/ in the surroundings or that it's just outside/ in front of the window. We cannot, however, tell the exact location of outside when we're not provided with any extra information. So this is an incorrect choice as well.  E: Picture may refer to a printed image of the fox. However, we don't have any printed or digital images that can provide that clue for us in the question. So we're left without a choice. To answer the question, we must find the place where the fox is and hence conclude that the question asked for a cabin (we know of its location) through a window (we know it's in front of it) where the fox is (the clue we were provided). Therefore, the answer to the question is: Outside, which is what's outside a cabin.

{"text": "Step 0:  The question is asking about Bob's Pok\u00e9mon cards.\n\nStep 1:  Choose an option from the provided answer choices:\n\nOption A suggests that the cards are 'personal'. What the word 'personal' essentially means is 'private/personalised' for a single person or entity. The Pokemon cards clearly are not for a single person but are for multiple people to share and play with.\n\nOption B suggests that the cards are special. Special indicates something that is uncommon, out of the ordinary or rare; but the cards themselves are not uncommon since they were available to the masses and not just produced for use by a single person or entity, nor could they be considered 'out of the ordinary' as they are fairly common and standard. Thus, they cannot be special.\n\nOption C suggests that the cards are shiny. The term shiny implies that the cards are new or glossy, but this does not indicate that the cards are what the question asks which is related to the value of the card. \n\nOption D suggests the cards are rare. The word rare implies that they are uncommon and not easily found, but the cards in question were produced for common consumption and the demand for such items usually causes card manufacturers to continuously produce new cards, rather than making them more rare. As a result, the cards are not rare. \n\nOption E suggests that the cards are irregular. Irregular indicates that the cards are abnormal, unconventional or inconsistent; but the Pok\u00e9mon cards are not abnormal, unconservative or inconsistent, rather they follow the same rules and patterns as other Pok\u00e9mon cards. As a result, they are not irregular either.\n\nSo, we can eliminate all the answer options and we are left with no choice.\n\nStep \n2:  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above because none of the answer choices are exactly what Bob's Pokemon cards were.\nSo the final is answer None of the Above\nInput: You want to be a part of a team in order to achieve a mutual goal.

Backache: This is pain that results from physical exertion or repetitive motions, and it is not exclusive to driving a car. It also does not fit well since a car that drives without any pain should not result in backache.\n\nChoice C: Eye strain: This is a result of looking at computer screens or other sources of light for long periods of time which is not relevant for driving since driving should be an activity done in day time, where eye strain is less likely to occur unless you stare at the road for long stretches of time.\n\nChoice D. Getting tired: This is a normal process while driving a car. The problem is that you only want things that do not involve pain, and driving is likely to cause stress since other cars will be driving recklessly or dangerously, etc, which can cause a stress response that is not pain but can be a form of discomfort.\n\nChoice E. Car crash: Incorrect, like stated earlier in the question, the car crashes and that would mean that it must involve some form of pain!\n\nStep 3. Given that the question doesn't state whether the car can drive normally when you turn it on, a swerving car (choice B) or a broken down car that you must push to start (choice D) could all count as a car that drives without the pain, but in this case, we are told that it doesn't end with pain. \n\nThe choice that can be discarded at this stage is choice C: Eye strains, this is the answer choice that does not involve pain.\n\nStep 5.

Since the question is related to keeping a digital file, we eliminate choice A, as it is related to paper files.\n\nStep 5. Now we need to determine which of those two types of filing system is more likely to be an appropriate fit.  Both options C and D allow the digital file to be filed away for an indefinite period, so we can eliminate Choice B.\n\nStep 6. Now we only have two options left, Choices A and C.  The first step (for identifying the correct choice) is to identify all aspects that are similar.  This includes the file can be kept indefinitely.

It is therefore not possible for a paper notice to be left on a suitcase.\n\nTherefore, we are left with options A, B, C and D which are all possible places for a paper notice to have been left. \n\nWe already know that option D can be eliminated, so the next thing to do is to find which location has the best fit with the statement \"It has been placed on the most appropriate place in the correct location.\". \n\nThis suggests we need to look at the words'most appropriate' and 'correct location'.\n\nOption A describes how the paper notice was located rather than the location itself.

Therefore, it can't be a correct location.\nOption C has the appropriate desk type associated with the correct location but doesn't describe the property of the correct location.\n\nOption D does describe the property of the relevant location, namely that it 'looks neatest'. But the use of 'neatest' suggests the wording could be better, and that the location could be anywhere.\nIt does not make a statement \"It has been left on the most appropriate place\", and therefore should be considered as out-of-range for the input.\n\nTherefore we are left with options C and D. \n\nBoth of these options can be eliminated as the description lacks detail about the location. \nThere is no word in the given statement which indicates that the paper on the desk is placed on the most appropriate desk in the correct location.\nHence, the most plausible answer is C", "answer": "A: front door"}

So we are not going to use any other data.\n\nStep 1: The question asks which word would describe Mary's interactions with James, given that she was not familiar with him initially. \n\nStep 2 : Examine the available choices. As the question asks for a single descriptive word, 'cold' and 'unfamiliar' would not quite fit. Also, 'unknown' does not quite follow the criteria either. \n\nStep3: However, 'unacquainted' and'shy' could both fit the description of what Mary might have been. \n\nStep4:So let's break down the meaning of both 'unacquaint' and'shy'. \n\nUnacquainted: This means not acquainted, or not knowing someone well. It could be used to describe two people who have previously not met or seen each other, such as in the context of the question. \n\nShy: This could potentially describe personality, where someone is reticent to socialize due to discomfort or apprehension. It could therefore suggest that Mary was feeling nervous about speaking with James, due to being unfamiliar with him and not wanting to start conversation. \n\nStep5: So the answer must be either 'unacquaintance' or'shy'.  We will need to break down the context and understand the usage of both, in order to arrive at the correct answer. \nStep 6: Let's break down 'unacquaint'. The word 'acquainted' means to get to know, so 'unacquaint'(ed) could essentially mean being unfamiliar with someone. It might be used when someone has not previously met or seen someone. To determine whether 'unacquaint(ed)' or'shy' is to be used in the given context, we need to see how well the context has provided us to eliminate one of the options. \n\nStep7: 'Mary wasn't a familiar with the James so she wasn't comfartable speaking to him.'

When it comes to discussing a matter, we can either tell the president or we can be consulting him about it. \n2. We can never both be consulting him and also be telling him, as there are two options presented within the question and the sentence structure states 'either X, or...'.\n3. The first phrase 'to tell the president the matter' is in present tense, whereas the second phrase 'to consult' uses past tense.

{"text": "Step 2: The choices presented are all relevant terms for the Tardis.\nChoice A:  Nuclear Power Plant - The nuclear power plant is a location for generating power through nuclear energy, but it is not specific to the Tardis. \nChoice B: Center - The Center is an indoor space in the Tardis that serves as a hub for interacting with objects and entities within it. It is the main area for navigation and control of the Tardis. Thus, this cannot be the master control. \nChoice C: Basement - Basement refers to the bottom level of a structure, often used as a storage area or a place for utilities. However, the Tardis's system cannot be found near utilities or items associated with storage areas.\nChoice D: Main Office - The main office is typically the central location for administrative functions, meetings, and communication. Again, not applicable to the Tardos's control room. \nChoice E: Bowel of the Ship - The bowel is the long and hollow structure of the body, containing the major organs of digestion and absorption. There are no references in the question nor in the rest of the conversation about the bowel of the ship being a location where humans travel to by the Tardis. In fact, in the conversation, it is the TARDIS that travels humans to the destinations. Thus, none of the other choices fit.\n\nStep 1: Thus, the correct answer is E: Bowel of \n\nthe ship\nStep 3:\nSo the final answer:Bowel of the ship \n\nInput: Who are the best fighters? Choices: A: samurai B: gladiators C: shoguns D: karate fighters E: ninjas\nOutput: Step 3: In order to determine which fighters are the best, it is necessary to consider the context in which they live and how they engage in combat with one another. For example, samurai were legendary Japanese warriors of the medieval period, known for their incredible skills with the sword and their unwavering loyalty to their daimyo (lord). Thus, in a historical context, they could be considered the best fighters. \nStep 2: The answers provided here are various types of warriors who fought in different time periods and locations", "answer": "B: center"}
{"text": "Step 6: The options provided are:\n\nChoice A: A Countryside is an area of land that is covered mainly in rural or remote areas. It is not a genre of television or a type of show, so it cannot be the answer.\n\nChoice B: We eliminate anthologies as anthologies are a collection of unrelated material. The question is asking about a specific television show, not a literary collection.\n\nChoice C: As we eliminate Dull reads, the most likely answer is to say that it is a state park as this is one of the options provided. However, a state park is not a type of show, it is just a type of place, and so it doesn't satisfy the context of the question.\n\nStep 7: As we have already used Choice A, B, and C, there isn't any other choice except for Choice D and Choice E, which is most likely for state park. State park is one of the options in the given choices and the question is about a specific television show. Thus, the answer will be Choice D: State Park.\n\nSo the final answer of this question is D: State Park\n\nInput:What kind of food do fish eat?

This does fit the context of the question as fish would inevitably eat tikka, and this is one of the choices available.\n\nChoice D-E: Tofu is a type of bean dish, not a type of fish. Furthermore, tofu is not eaten by fish, but is more usually eaten by humans.\n\nStep 5: We are left with A: Tiki-Toki and B&C: Fish. Fish is an animal that typically eats tikka so that is the answer.\nSo the final answers is:A: Tiki-Tiki\n\nInput: A sneeze is one of the few times in which the", "answer": "B: anthology"}

We could either use the same reason to rule out an answer of, for instance, the C: candle, since that is likely to have little to no light emitted.\nThe B: sky seems obvious to be ruled out as well, since clearly the B: sky is not something we carry around.\nHowever, if someone had a house, it makes little sense it would be carried around, and so we can eliminate it.\n\nStep 6: So we are left with only the D: house, which is the most obvious answer left as a possibility. But since the question refers to a vintage, an antique, there is more information needed to be found out. If something is a vintage antique, usually, it would be a decorative thing.  But, if we were searching for a light source and there was no other hint in the question, the most likely thing is a lamp or a candle, but since it is specified they are \u201cvintage\u201d and \u201cdecorative\u201d there might be some other vintage decorative light source that doesn\u2019t match the given choices, hence it would be pointless to discard an answer based on what are the choices at hand, for it might not be what we are looking so, even though it is the most obvious answer, we proceed forward.\n\nStep 7: The choice left at hand is the D: house. If you were to have a house, you would hardly carry round a house, or have it in your possession, but most likely it is home, meaning one\u2019s abode. Since we are looking for a decorative light source now, the most likely answer is a candle.\n\nStep 8: Thus, the final answer would be C: candle", "answer": "C: candle"}

Procrastination can be caused by different things such as a lack of motivation, boredom, or a preoccupation with other activities. \n\n2) Looking at the choices, we can eliminate C (tiredness). The question states that procrastination is the cause of the problem and tiredness is a symptom of procrastination and is not the cause.\n\n3) Eliminating Options A and E, we can conclude that the root cause of procrastination is sitting down and staying idle. There is no indication of progress or excitement, but rather inactivity and inaction.

Choices: 1: Pessimist 2: optimist 3: rationalist 4: mystic 5: believer 6: hedonist\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking for type of person who tries and fails to create her own reality. The information provided on the multiple choice answer includes the definition of 'try and fail' which suggests that there is an absence of success or at least an inability to bring about the desired result.\n\n2.) The term 'believer' refers to a person who holds fixed beliefs, while the term 'hedonist' refers to a person motivated by pleasure.\n\n3.) The term'mystic' refers to a person whose beliefs are based on revelation or intuition.\n\n4.) The term 'pessimist' refers to a predominant personality trait where beliefs may be negatively inclined, while the term 'optimist' refers to a belief that the outcome of a situation will be positive.\n\n5.) The term 'rationalist' refers to a preference for logic and reason, while the term 'progressive' refers to growth or an improvement.\n\n6.)

It's a board game by which states are represented by numbered and lettered pawns. The object is to gain control of each state. If a candidate's number of pawns equals the number of electors, they win.  In the 2000 election, the Democrats had 176 electors, and the Republicans 236. George Bush, the Republican candidate, won with 271, and Bill Clinton won with 216 electoral votes.

{"text": "Step 4: Considering the types of copies that can be produced on such a machine, including business and invoice copies, we can determine that an 'old copier' might reasonably be used to produce documents for an office environment. In addition, due to the lack of copy restriction and convenience, a machine like this could be used freely within a school or university setting. Thus, we can eliminate choice D (school).\n\nStep 5: An industrial building could be where industrial items, including the 'copier', are made or repaired. However, it is not feasible to view an old copier within such an environment as no old machines would be there. We can then conclude that all industrial buildings would then fail to satisfy the criteria, making choice A infeasible, as well. Therefore, we can discard choice B as infeasible. Step 6: A barn is an outbuilding where livestock are kept. Based on the description 'an old copier', we can determine that the item in question will not be an active one, being used to make copies, but an older, disused copier. This means a 'barn' would not contain 'an old copier'. Choice C is, therefore, infeasible. \n\nStep 7: A museum is a location where historical artifacts are displayed for education. Old 'copiers' may have had a historical significance at one point but aren't relevant to the question asked. They may be collected, but would not be displayed for viewing. Therefore, museums would not be suitable. A 'copier' would not likely be found in a barn and it cannot be assumed to be found in an office and we can eliminate choice E. It is clear that choice B (museum) is infeasible.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, we are left with choices A (industrial area) and C (barn). The 'copier' is more likely to be found in a barnyard than in an industrial area, barn has been ruled in as infeasible, and choice A has been ruled out as infeasible by earlier analyses, the answer is D (barn).\nSo the final answer should be D: Barn\n\n### What if the wrong question is asked?\nThis section helps in identifying when you should use this problem:\n\nInstruction: What's", "answer": "B: museum"}

It's an adverb, so we examine the question for a prepositional phrase or gerund verb. \nStep 2: We see choices like building, dock, concert hall, and museum. It seems that these verbs have some connections with prepositions and their meanings. These must be used with the right prepositions! \nStep 3: We use a structure like \"in public\". We know that performing is done in public, not private, so we guess that the prepositions \"on\" and \"for\" here must be combined. \nStep 4: From \"for public\" we can deduce that the performers are somewhere for public. \nStep 5: We don't yet have a verb, but we now can guess more about the performers. They are on a platform of some kind, maybe a stage. That might indicate that they are likely in a building, not outside. \nStep 6: We guess that performers are on a platform that is on the ground, which we determine to be a stage. \nStep 7: Now we have a new context to look at a list of candidates: arena, building, dock, concert \nStep 8: We notice that arena is not a building so we need to rule it out.

However, we know that the child's party would require a venue - not just a child. It is true that some balloons or two might be given to a child, but they would not be the sole requirement. We can also reject answer B \"birthday party\", since the question asks for a venue and not a party.\n\n5: With this, we reach the conclusion that answer D \"child's party\" is the correct answer. That is, a balloon or two might be given at a child's party, but they are not essential to it.\nSo the final choice is A: Child's party\n\nInput: How quickly do you need to drive to get to the grocery store?

We can also eliminate option C because it is too late at night. However, an alligator is more likely to be spotted in warm weather, so option E at 6:30pm is likely to be true at all times of the year.\nStep 2: Looking specifically at the information we have, we can rule out option F because alligators are carnivorous; they are not herbivores, so options C and D can be eliminated for this reason. \nStep 3: This leaves us with two answers; option C (3 am) and option E (6:30 pm). However, they both refer to a different time (of day", "answer": "C: breaks to help stop"}

Since this is talking about a judge giving a speech after a trial and a court proceeding, we can eliminate option B. Note that this is a very common type of judgment in fiction, such as that in the play Julius Caesar, and that the death itself need not directly involve a human. For instance, the death of the Roman Republic could be another example of death of.\n\nChoice D. A negative is a concept or situation seen as a bad thing. A murderer is probably going to be considered a negative moral character in court, and a speech from a judge could describe the murderer as negative. However, the choices given do not contain the word negative, so we can eliminate it.\n\nChoice E. The Judge called the murderer evil in the speech. Evil does not refer to specific morals, but rather is a term used for people who do immoral things. Since the judge gave a speech after the murderer was found to be guilty, he could call the murderer evil.\n\nStep 03: Now we're left with the answer choices, A: Wrong and B: Pure,  We can combine each of the possible meanings of these words. Pure means that something is free from impurities, so in this case the murderer is innocent. Therefore, there is now a chance he could be a good person. However, innocence is not a moral value.\n\nStep 5: If the murderer was innocent then by default he could have other characteristics, such as being a good person. Therefore we can choose A and B. At this point, either choice will be correct, since they both have the two conditions (being guilty and speaking to a murderer). \n\nHowever, it makes more sense to choose B (Pure). A murderer could speak directly to a judge at the end of a trial to tell him he is innocent.  In terms of morality, being pure is much more closely associated with having good morals than being wrong. Therefore, the answer to the question is B: Pure.\n\n\nSo the", "answer": "E: evil"}

Choices A: ask the DM to give everyone a roll. B: ask the DM to roll for you. C: go out for 20 minutes and then return. D: stay in your chair doing nothing\nOutput: In this case, our given information is the information we need in order to give the simplest answer. The choices are; If you are playing an ancient D&D game, what is it you should do? and what do you do if you are playing a modern game... \n\nAnswer A: is the best answer in this case because the game is old, and most likely one of the DM's roles is to roll all the dice. By doing this, the player doesn't need to worry about rolling or having any role in the decision making. Answer A: Ask the DM to give everyone an opportunity\n\nAnswer A: Stay in your chair doing nothing. is the worst answer because it does not make any sense if you are playing an old game.

{"text": "So, we are not told in which state John currently resides so we can rule out option A (Oklahoma is a state) and option B (Developed Land is simply an adjective) without needing to answer this question.\n\nFor all other options, we are concerned with what John's next destination will be. He takes a highway, which presumably means a freeway, rather than any other road, thus, we can eliminate option C (United States) since this is simply geographical information about the states.\n\nJohn traveling straight through the South might imply he is moving towards Mexico, so we can rule out the country, option E (Mexico). So we are left with State options: A (Oklahoma), B (New Mexico), C (Texas) - these are all in the South, and option D (Arkansas) - this state is in the south-east, slightly away from John's route.\n\nLet's look at the options a little more closely: A) Oklahoma is in the South but it's not a Southwestern state. B) New Mexico and Texas, like option D, are in the Southwest and both are neighbouring states of Oklahoma, so they're both unlikely. Texas is John's current home state, so it could be a viable option, but we can eliminate it.\n\nIt leaves us with Choice D (Arkansas). John did not have to go through Arkansas to get to where he was headed, but his journey to the final destination in the South would be quicker, and he is guaranteed to end up there because his journey will be continued.\n\nIn fact, John can end up only in Arkansas, or Texas, and his destination will be Arkansas. Arkansas is the only state in the South that matches the 'didn't stop' criteria. Therefore we can answer this question as A: Arkansas.\n\nSo the final answer D: Arkansas\n\n\n### Instruction:What is the best part of working at home? \n\nAnswer: The question is ambiguous\n\nBecause it could refer to working in a home rather than working at a home", "answer": "E: mexico"}

{"text": "Step 2: \nStep 3: The question asks us to determine the correct answer choice that applies to 'people applying for the job'.\nStep 4: As 'critical thinking' and 'equal opportunity' are the only choices that relate directly to those who are applying for the job, we should assume that those are the correct answers. Therefore, the correct choices are critical thinking, equal opportunity.\nStep 5: While 'equal opportunity' and 'critical thinking' both give applicants tools to succeed, 'equal opportunity' is the more appropriate answer as it is more directly tied to helping applicants based on their background versus giving them critical thinking tools to succeed.\nStep 6: We also know that the 'equal opportunity' answer applies to applicant versus the 'congratulate' answer that applies to employees that have been selected for the job, which narrows the answer space. So, for this question, 'equal opportunity' and not 'congratulate'.\nStep 7:  'Congratulate' is in the list of choices, but it's not the correct selection of a candidate does NOT mean that they got the job. The correct answer is 'equal opportunity'.\n\nSo the final answer  is Equal opportunity.\nInput: What is more enjoyable for children between the ages 8 to 10 (the age of puberty), playing video games, or playing outside?

Playing outside can involve other activities, such as playing with friends, so it is not explicitly stated if that is included in the question. 5. The question requires us to determine if the child prefers to play video games or outside. 6. We know that playing video games is a single choice, and the child does not get to make the choice. 7. The child enjoys playing with friends, not playing outside.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer must be playing video games. \nSo the final answer for the question is A: Video games.", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

{"text": "Step 0: The question asks us to identify a place where John avoids going.\n\nStep 1: The question specifically mentions that John avoids places where animals are abused. This leads us to eliminate choice A (pet store) as places like pet stores may involve animal abuse.\n\nStep 5: We then have to examine John\u2019s personal attributes to determine which choices remain within the parameters of his preferences. For example, John hates animal abuse, so any place where animals are abused is an immediate negative. John also loves animals, so we can eliminate any negative place choices as well. Finally, John is careful about where he goes, and he avoids going to places he does not like, so places he hates are automatically negatives.\n\nStep 6: We have removed most of the negative options (pet store, parking lot and woodland) to narrow our focus to one choice that remains positive: Park. John avoids going to places where animals are abuses, so parks are safe. John also loves the animal, so parks are positive. John is careful about where to go, so parks are still a good choice. Parks are also nice to go to. The correct answer, therefore, is E: Park.\n\nSo the final answer in this case is E: Park\n\nInput: What are the only animals in the Arctic Circle?

So there has to be an explanation for why Sarah thought that she would leave at a certain time in the morning.\nStep 2: Consider this: Sarah thought that she would be home all day and evening.

We could get distracted and begin to wonder what we're actually doing there...We certainly wouldn't be feeling sick!\nStep 4: Ill or sick in this case means, \u201cfeeling unwell.\u201d We can eliminate this answer as being the right selection for the question, as the question does not provide a context where you could feel unwell and also not feel you were at the opera. Additionally, an opera could be considered fun, which we know from the text is not a boring thing to go to - we'd feel relaxed, even if not ill.\nStep 5: Headache - if we had a headache after the opera, we would most likely be sick (the question does not indicate whether we should consider only the first case where we feel sick after the opera). So let\u2019s find another answer. \nStep 6: Now, let\u2019s look at relaxation - what would we feel when we go to the opera if relaxed? Relaxed in the sense of being \u201cpleasantly calm\u201d or \u201cat ease\u201d - yes! We would feel relaxed when we go to the theatre because it\u2019s relaxing.

We could feel confused or bored. Therefore, the answer could possibly be c, boredom.\nStep 8: To find out definitively we compare the provided options by eliminating all but one, checking it against the context of the question by saying, \"Okay, would I feel this if I go to the opera for boredom to be eliminated?\"\nStep 9: So, for boredom to become relaxation (the feeling we must choose), boredom must be ruled out as possible.\nThe answer is therefore b", "answer": "D: relaxation"}

{"text": "1) The question is asking what will happen if a person succeeds in committing suicide, so the correct response should provide an answer in terms of consequences.\n\n2) Eliminate options that do not provide a consequence for failure: D (killing yourself), E (dying).\n\n3) The statement \"if I kill my kids, I'd definitely get arrested\" would mean that a person would fail in their attempt at suicide (otherwise, why would they try to kill themselves?). Therefore, this means that D (killing yourself) is not an option, as that would not be a consequence.\n\n4) We can assume that a successful suicide should be a consequence of suicide, so we can further eliminate option E (dying). \n\n5) As an extension of earlier logic (in which the statement that \"if I kill my kid\" implies that the person won't attempt suicide), we can eliminate option B: scars as a result of an unsuccessful suicide attempt would not be logical.\n\n6) The statement \"I'd rather fail than succeed at killing myself\" suggests that being killed is a consequence for failing, so eliminating option A (sorrow), we are left to decide between C (misery) and E (scars). \n\n7) The statement \"I will not try\" suggests a willingness to succeed in committing suicide if the situation is ideal (so failing would mean that they will not try), but for a non-ideal setting (so failing would imply that the person would try). \n\nFrom this logic, we can conclude that C (misery) is the most likely answer. \n\n8) This is because if you are successful with suicide, the misery that results is an obvious consequence of that. On the other hand, the sentence \"I will not die by suicide\", even after failing, does not imply any further outcome. \n\nThus, we can conclude that the most likely answer to this question is C: misery.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is  C: misery", "answer": "E: kill yourself"}

It is easy to find plastic items in the living room. So, we can rule them out as well. Therefore, we are left with A: cupboard and B: cabinet.\n\nStep 1: Both, cabinet and cupboard are places where you keep your things. Therefore, there is no difference between them.

So if there are 3,4 or 5 rides, this is a good answer for us.\n\nStep 5) If there are two answers C,F, we should go through them, but F has one ride less, so C it is.\n\nStep 6) Step 3: A family of four would spend the majority of their time in a place that would give them an enjoyable experience. That's why we should eliminate A.\n\nStep 7) Step 2: So if they spend a lot of time in C, that is probably the best place for them.\n\nStep 8) Step 1: So the correct answer to this question is C.\n\n###### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice questions\n\nInput: Which way to read the graph?

{"text": "1st: The bride and groom in the input are obviously taking care of a proposal, and, since it is specified that it is likely a marriage proposal, it also means that it is likely a wedding.  \n\n2nd: We can rule out options B, C, and D since they all refer to a process of taking care, which is something that usually comes immediately after a proposal is made and has been taken care of; and they all involve one group doing something.\n\n3rd: The input says the proposal is being taken care of, meaning it has already been taken care of or that it is continuing. If it is continuing, it means it is ongoing and option E: Results would not make sense because something should have already resulted from the process of taking care of the proposal, which could be the marriage.  \n\n4th: Option E: Results would only make sense in 3rd:, because it specifies that they are taking care of the proposal.\n\n5th: It is more probable that option A: Efficiency is the one that has the right answer because it fits the criteria better.

Thus option A, 'pocket' is the most logical answer. \n\nChoices B, D, and E: Do not have a razor sharpener. \n\nChoice E has a shaving kit which a razor might be part of, but when the owner is expecting to sharpen a razor, he is more likely to use a razor sharpener itself. Thus, shaving kit should be removed from the list. However, if a person is not used to sharpen a single or double edge razor, it would be less probable to sharpen it from a box where he would keep his razors. Thus choice E must be removed. \n\nChoicce D has a drugstore that does not store razors. \n\nChoice F: Shower, would contain razors, a shaving kit, and razor sharpener. However, when a person is expecting to sharps his razor, a sharpener would be the most probable instrument used to sharpen the razor and not his shaving kit.

Early Death could indicate feelings of awe when faced with death or an acceptance of it when the end is near, but they do not indicate a full or complete life.

It may be an inevitable fact of life, but one is not in control of it.\n\nChoices C \u2013 Pain feels like a negative experience.\n\nChoice D \u2013 Tiredness is also not relevant. Being tired doesn't necessarily make someone feel fully alive.\n\nChoice E \u2013 Joy does not really indicate a full life: it could be that one feels fully alive without feeling joy.\n\nIn the end, the best answer is probably Choice E.

The answer refers to the fact that most people prefer to eat at restaurants, but not the specific reason why. \n6. Therefore we can rule out choice C (restaurant). And we know that it wouldn't normally be the case that a person can't find a restaurant in their hometown - the statement \u201clikes to eat\u201d implies a preference, and preference is normally possible.\n\nThis leaves us with 2 answers: A) movie theater or B) in the car.

One can assume that the pamphlets regarding diseasse would be found in theaters after the plays, but not all theaters. Hence, the clue provides no clue that would lead to the correct answer. However, all the other choices have one word (either it starts or ends with) \"draw\" but, as we saw there were no drawers in theatres. This observation helps in elimination of certain other chocies.\nStep 4: The next choice is library, but there can be found more than 1 library and one might not feel like going to each one to check if there are pamphlets there. Hence, the possibility is unlikely in the eyes of most of the people.\nStep 5: For the following two choices, most people are likely to have \"health department\" in their mind. However, health department is not the place where one would expect to find pamphlets regarding the diseases. Hence those two choices are less likely to be correct.\nStep 7: We can now assume that the other choice is mailbox, since mailbox, as per the question, does have pamphlets in it.\nStep 8: The mailbx is a place where people can reach and hence not all of them would have a mailbox, so this choice is also out of the realm of expected results of a majority of people.\nStep 9: Hence, in the end, the last choice is \"drawer\", which is a place where any person would expect to find pamphonlets.

{"text": "The question is asking for help from a bus station - which is a transit stop where buses, coaches, etc, stop to let travellers on and off.\n\nStep 1: We know that this station doesn't exist within city centres. Instead, we're referring to a bus stop. In bus stops, you could sometimes find maps. But this question is not saying to go looking for maps, instead it tells you that the bus station can indeed help you. \n\nStep 2. Considering this, the answer most likely to be correct is A: city centre: as city centre is somewhere where people congregate, it is most likely to have maps on offer at a bus stop.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the correct multiple choice answer is either A: city centre or B: city centre. So the final answer is A & B: city centre as this would be the most likely place that you would find a map for assistance.\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n\nInput: What can you do that gives you the greatest satisfaction?

Many people have children because they want to pass on their genes that will live on through the next generation. It could also be a desire to give children the best care that they can so that they live happy, fulfilling lives. Either way, it would be difficult for having children to bring satisfaction in a long lasting way. \n\nStep C: Run a marathon.

However, while swimming might give you a swimming pool of sweat, it does not necessarily do that under any other conditions. \nChoice E: This might be another choice that might come to your mind, but this cannot be the correct choice because although fear can cause you to need to urinate, that is not because you are wet. \nChoice C: Again, this might be another option you might consider, but while being scared or full of fear can lead you to being in a hurry to think something through, that does not by itself make the person wet. \nChoice A: This is a very strong candidate as running can definitely make your clothes get wet, even if you are not wet. \nChoice D: This option might seem like a valid explanation for the question as war/battle can be scary, and if your fist is wet you might be wet all over as your body tends to sweat when doing physical activity. However, the wording \"full of fear\" might lead us to believe that this might be more of a physical reaction to fear rather than it meaning that you are wet.  Remember that the full meaning of the phrase \"full of fear\" is that you are feeling scared to the max. \nChoice E cannot be the correct choice, as sweat does not make something wet, it makes your sweatshirt wet which means you got wet from sweatshirt.

{"text": "1) The question is asking about clothes that have developed an odor and cannot be washed.\n2) Hanging them in the closet (choice A) wouldn't help if they were stained - for example, clothes may contain food stains that cannot be removed while hanging in the closet.\n3) A person can sniff clothes to check for a smell, but this wouldn't solve the problem if the clothes are permanently odor-free after being washed or washed and then air dried. \n4) Wearing or using dirty clothes will only increase the smell of a clothing item, but a person should avoid doing this if the clothes have a permanent smell. \n5) Airing out clothes is a common step for eliminating smells, but it has been suggested that airing clothes only prolongs their smell. \n6) Lastly, we could get rid of a smell by having the clothes professionally cleaned (which would typically involve washing the clothes prior to professional cleaning, which is also necessary to get rid of a smelly smell), noting that professional cleaning could cost significantly. \nSo the final answer to what to do with the clothes is E: air out.", "answer": "E: air out"}
{"text": "1: The question presents a problem which arises when an individual is unable to learn.\n\n2: From the choices provided, we can observe that:\na. Option A - Intelligence: Can refer to both the ability to acquire knowledge and the capacity to think or reason. However, the question does not elaborate on these features and thus, inability to learn cannot be attributed to this.\nb. Option B - Education: Education refers to the process of gaining knowledge and skill from various sources and activities. Inability to learn cannot be associated with education.\nc. Option C - Effectiveness: Effectiveness can be defined as being able to achieve desired results in the process of learning. Inability to learn does not directly indicate ineffectiveness.\nd. Option D - Distress: Distress is a feeling of unease or emotional suffering. However, inability to learn does not necessarily indicate distress as one could still learn, but find the material complicated or challenging.\ne. Option E - A Stupid: A stupid person is one who has a limited or limited intellectual capacity for thinking, reasoning, and using language. But inability to learn does refer to a situation in which one is unable to learn. If you refer to the definitions of these terms, this would mean that if a stupid person is unable to learn, then one cannot be classified as stupid.\n\nTherefore, using information gathered in Step 2, the correct answer is choice B - Education\nSo the final answer id B: education", "answer": "D: distress"}

Friends (Choice E)\n\t- Used in the sense of to 'talk with' or 'hang out with'\n\n 6. See People (Choice D)\n\t- Uused in the sense of 'to be seen together' \n\n7. Since See is defined as 'be seeing together' the only people we can see would be Friends, we are therefore talking to friends (in the sense of 'to talk with'). \n\n8. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is: \"People were talking with friends\".\nSo the final answer  is D: See people\n\nInput:If no one was injured, who were the victims of road accidents?

The word \"victims\" should be understood as \"those affected or harmed\" as it is a synonym for \"victim\". No one was injured but there were \"people affected\" by the accident therefore there must be \"people affected\" by this accident (ie. victims)\n3. No one was injured so option A has to be removed\n4. The choices are left with:\n\t1. People affected by the accident (victims, 1 of them affected) = \"people\". \"people", "answer": "C: with people"}

Olive is a food item and it is not fit for consumption in water. Thus, glasses is not the correct answer.\nChoice C: Jar: Container made with glass or stone, used for storing food and other liquid products\n\nChoice D: Pizza: a round or square-shaped bread typically loaded with cheese or toppings and covered with tomato sauce.\nThe question is not asking about what the food item is, but about where it can be stored.\n\nChoice E : Refrigerator: a refrigerator is a large electrical appliance that cools air or a liquid so that food and drinks can be stored for a long period of time.\nIt is not a suitable food storage option as the food is already kept refrigerated.\n\nStep 8: The only possible answer would be: Choice A: eaten. Olive is an ingredient used as a starter, as a side dish or as part of the main course.

{"text": "The question is asking where did the man put his luggage while he drove himself to the airport.\nStep 1: The terms given are driving, luggage, and airport and some of these words are generic, e.g. luggage could mean personal or business. It is possible the man was driving in a car. If it was a long distance drive, the closet in the car would be used to hold luggage.\nStep 2: However, we can eliminate these possibilities by the given statements of self-driving to the airport and that the luggage is his own. Since only he is moving the vehicle and transporting himself, it is unlikely there is someone else in the vehicle to put the luggage in the closet.\nStep 3: The question clearly has a specific item of luggage in mind, which is a suitcase, as the man is heading to the airport. This means we assume he was driving a car, not public transport.\nStep 4: There is, however, no mention of how far from the airport the man lived \u2013 it could be a mile away, or 50 miles away \u2013 or if the bus stop, hotel or sidewalk (bus stop is included to rule out public transport) were more convenient than the trunk.\nStep 5: We cannot eliminate all the other choices either, although the question states that the man put his luggy in the trunk. If he lived somewhere close to the airport, a short drive, then the trunk would be better. Alternatively, it could be if it was raining or cold, or because he was wearing a seatbelt. He may assume an airline or taxi driver knows where to place his luggage.\nEither he did not put his luggage into the trunk while driving or did not drive himself to the airport at all. We do not know, only his decision based on several considerations.\nNo matter the choice, it would not be possible to determine the answer based on the information given.\nStep 6: Therefore, the answer is that the man did not put his luggy in his trunk.\nSo the final question is How old are you? the question is asking how old do you think the person is. So the answer is B answer. So the final answer is B", "answer": "E: trunk"}

But, the way it is written doesn't suggest that pens are not working. So, this cannot be the correct answer. \n\nChoice D: take notes is a grammatically incorrect expression and means something else.\n\nChoice B: There is nothing that suggests that the pens are 'not working' because they are not 'inked in' with the cap on. So, this cannot also be the correct answer. Even if you add a comma in the choice then also it doesn't make much sense since 'caps off' is a phrase that suggests the pens are 'capped off', and not 'not working'.\n\nChoice C: Pens do not use ink cartridges, they use ink.

To determine the best answer, we will consider the remaining choices: Complex, Learn about and Interests.\nComplex: Is a broad term that may refer to the object as having many parts or parts that are difficult to understand. However, it is also a term that is not very specific, and doesn't indicate what exactly she was considering doing with it. Complex is an unlikely answer to the question, as the word does not directly reflect what she had in mind or her intentions.\nLearn about: The action of learning about the object in question may involve exploring it in greater detail, such as studying it, reading about it, etc. However, it does leave room for interpretation whether it means learning in the sense of expanding one's knowledge on the object or learning in the sense of determining how to make use of the object. The term \"learning about\" is too vague, and it could mean either learning or making informed use of something, such as exploring the object further in order to understand how to use it. Therefore, we can eliminate this as an option.\nInterests: Is something that indicates a type of interest that the person may have in relation to the object. However, this doesn't actually indicate what she was considering doing with the object, and it would be likely that she would have already made up her mind regarding her interest in it by the time she was considering what to do with the object. Interests is a vague term that doesn't answer our question effectively.\nTherefore, we are left with the best option, which would be Buy and Complex. Complex is a bit vague and not very specific, but it does refer to the object as something that is difficult to understand. Buy, on the other hand, is a specific action and is in line with the overall context of the question.\nSo the final and correct answer is B: Buy\n\nInput: The woman said, \"His body was still warm.\" What did she mean?

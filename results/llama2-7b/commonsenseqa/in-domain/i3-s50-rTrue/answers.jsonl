{"text": "Rationales: It's obvious that he's talking about his fridge, but he used a synonym for it: \"What\". This can happen pretty easily. You might forget the name of someone you know quite well.

Instead, it can refer to someone or something in general. If someone comes up to you and says, \"What, hey buddy?\" they are most likely just being friendly.

(The article is the object of be.) However, the verb is singular, the verb is wrong.\nC: The object (going to read the last article) is plural, and the verb (is going...) is plural, but the predicate subject is not plural, so it\u2019s grammatically wrong.\nD: The object (going...), the predicate subject, and the verb are singular here, meaning that you don\u2019t want a plural verb.\nE: Not only does this have a plural predicate subject (reads is incorrect here), but the word order is off.

{"text": "> This one's easy. \"Hoping people would what _______ his offer\" is an erroneous way of saying, \"Hoping people _______ his offer.\" The meaning is clearly \"Hoping people wouldn't respond to his offer.\" So I'll eliminate A, B, and C, and then get the rest of the way by process of elimination. I don't suppose anyone would \"contact\" a salesperson to decline a product or service. Also no, someone would not \"answer\" a salesperson even if, technically speaking, we might define this by saying, \"One must answer a polite 'no'\" or \"I might answer, 'Yes!' to a person we don't trust and then tell them I don't want it anyway.\" That takes it out of the scope of all reasonable responses. So we must conclude that no one can \"attract ______ ducks,\" and the answer can hardly be \"ducks,\" could it? So the only answer left is \"what\" because the correct expression is \"Hoping people won't do what ________ his offer.\" But the person didn't want people to what. He wanted them to say \"no\" to his offer because he knows it would attract a lot of ducks. You should be able to get an \"A\" by being clever enough to answer by process of elimination, and I must say that the process itself is not complicated.

However, if someone is already drinking alcohol and they continue to drink it, they can become more prone to falling down. They might also continue drinking alcohol even if they are over-consuming so much that it can make them pass out and not wake up until they're sober.\n3.

{"text": "The correct answer is B: dog park! Dogs need to get exercise and socialization just as humans do, so taking them for a walk or to dog parks is a perfect way to maintain their physical and mental well-being!\n\n### Detailed explanation\n\nThe question is asking for a location that is indoors and gives dogs plenty of space to play and run. In order to do this, we must first consider what spaces indoors that meet these requirements might be. First, it says that it \"stayed strictly inside,\" so we must therefore eliminate any outdoor locations, such as a living room, big house or even a park. This leaves us to eliminate only the inside options of \"dog park\" and \"small apartment,\" as a dog park is an indoor area where people can go to walk or play with dogs, and small apartments don't have enough space to comfortably fit a dog on its own. Lastly, we must choose the option that is both indoors and gives the dog space in which to roam and play. This leaves us with the only option of dog park. So, the answer is B: dog !", "answer": "E: big house"}

Make a loud noise to attract an uninvolved predator to eat the original predator. This predator is larger than the original one.\n\n### Process for solving the above task\n\n### Example: \n\nStep 1: In this case, run as quickly as possible and do everything in your power to avoid being killed. When you flee to the nearest water, it will also cause the predator to get wet by fleeing. The predator's natural instinct to avoid water will cause him to lose interest in you and flee from you, leaving you alone.\nStep 2. When you get away from the predator, call for help or raise a sign. \nStep 3: Find a safe tree to help you see. When the predator returns, it is more likely that the new predator will target the predator that pursued you, leaving you alone again. Return to where you fled.\nStep 4. When the predator leaves, look for more signs that indicate prey nearby to avoid being targeted again. \nStep 5.

Since room and church can already fit in the given room, the answer D: room would be impossible.\n\n### Rationales:  1. Bathroom and closet are not apartment rooms, but areas to store or house objects. 2.

Option C, grocery store, is an unusual choice to allow a cow to reside. It is more probable that the cow will be killed at whichever cattle ranch that supplies the cow to the grocery store.\n\n4. Option D, slaughterhouse, is not applicable because the goal of the farmer is to save the heifer and keep her from the slaughterhouse.\n\n5.

Choices:  I. airplane\nII. subway\nIII. airplane III\nIV. ferry V. bicycle\nVI. airplane VII. bicycle\nAnswer:\nVIII. airplane.\n\nWe know that the city is called Boulder.  The city of Boulder, Colorado is known for \"its outdoorsy environment.\"  Thus, it is not correct that \"one way to get there\" would be by  subways.  This leaves us with three remaining options:  flying, bicycling or a ferry.\nFlying is possible and would not require a ferry.  Ferrying may be a mode of transportation for getting to Boulder, Colorado  but not \"one way.. to [the] city.\" A bicycle could be a mode of transport there, as the route between Denver to Boulder is 37 miles and includes 1825 feet of climbing, but this would be a very long way to travel by bicycle to \"the city.\"  We can therefore \"eliminate A, C, D, and E.\"  \"A person should travel there by flying, not bicycling.\" The answer is either B or F.\nFrom \"City of Boulder's Topography Map\", it shows that the city of Boulder is in an area called Boulder Valley.  Thus, \"One could take the ferry to the Boulder Valley\" because it is the nearest water.  Although the city is near a large reservoir, Boulder Reservoir, this area is not part of either Boulder City or Boulder Creek.  Since \"the Boulder Creek Area\" and \"City of Boulders Landscape\" are near both the city and the reservoir, the answer would be in that area. A ferry is the best way to reach the city of Boulders Landcape.  This is a perfect response.\n\n### Sample Responses\nThe following are from the sample responses.

This could result in him digging up buried treasure.\n3. Bury his money, like some gangsters do. This doesn't make sense because he doesn't know who is buried there or what gangster he plans to bury his money with.\n4. Bury his money as a joke since \"I don't think anyone will find it...\", even though that is not true\n\nFinally left with only \"Bury his money in the yard\", which matches the scenario of the entire book. He trusts banks, he doesn't dig up buried treasure with gangsters, he would like some money to win the competition and bury in his yard makes this scenario much more realistic.\n\n### Inference: An inference is something that can be deduced or inferred from something else.

Every person who is great at (something) has focus and dedication, but not with the same intent.\n\t\tFocusing on something is not dedicating to something or vice versa.\n2. The word \u201cwhat\u201d is not commonly used, and the correct answer should be a word with a common usage pattern.\n4. The word is plural, thus \u201cwhat\u201d is wrong. \u201cWhat to it\u201d would be a sentence.\n5. The given choices are not logical. For example, a person who is great at painting is focused and dedicated, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have luck. \n\n### Answer:\nTo eliminate all incorrect answers, a focus and dedication are not the same thing.\nIn a combination of all the above rationales, focus and what would be an incorrect answer as \"focus and what?\" is the most common type of sentence.\nA person who is great at  painting does not necessarily have \"hatred\" towards painting. A person who is great at swimming does not necessarily have \"surprised\"? at swimming. Neither does a person who is great 25 at swimming \"hatred\"? for 25,\nIn addition, \"What to it\" is not a common use to say \"what to it?\" in this context.\nAs a result, the answer is D.

{"text": "The answer, according to the prompt, is `E: grocery store`. By the dictionary definition, a newspaper delivery refers to a person who delivers newspapers. A grocery store is a store that sells food and other household items. It would make the most sense for a grocery store because it sounds more general and would fit the bill. However, the answer must be consistent with the entirety of the text, therefore, any place where newspapers would be delivered outside of a grocery store would likely sound unfamiliar.\n\nAdditionally, one can argue that the answer should be grocery stores as opposed to grocery store since it makes the sentence more accurate and can't be easily confused with plural.\n\n### Input 2\nThe problem states: \"The referee called a f...\":\n\nThis sentence makes _no sense_ at all.

As the name states, the location can be any country, but it must be one that is commonly referred to as a destination for motor vehicle travel. \n\nFrom this, the choice E, Japan, can be ruled out. It is a location to visit, not necessarily motor vehicle travel.  Similarly, the choice C, Spain, is another option, though the country name can also be a location for motor vehicles. \n   \nThe choice D, New Jersey, is likely, considering that it is a US state and its location indicates it is in the northeast section of the country.\n\nThe choice B: United States, then, is likely as an answer.", "answer": "E: england"}
{"text": "I understand your concern about this particular question, but my instructor has informed me that the question was properly constructed and is indeed valid.\n\nHere is why:\n\n>*The Question*: How might compassionate thoughtful be described as being...\n\nTo answer this question, we must first understand the full sentence by interpreting two distinct parts. For example, look at the sentence above. It is asking us to interpret as:\nHow can compassionate be described as being thoughtful?\n\nHowever, look at this:\n>*The Question in Context*: How might compasstionate thoughful be referred to as being?\n\nThis is a completely different question from the previous one, with a very different purpose. For example, we now have to guess how compassionate thoughfull could be referred to within a context. \n\nIn order for an answer to be considered valid, one would have to evaluate the following parts:\n  * What does this question (or phrase) exactly mean?\n  * How can I interpret this?\n\nHowever, in order to answer this, we have to consider the context.

If we don't, we can't give a valid and appropriate response. \n\nLet's take a look at what I mean (this is a very complex question, but we'll try to break it down and make it easier to understand).\n\nFirst, this paragraph is about describing compassionate thoughtfull and how it can be defined with other words. This is a very complex sentence and we can't simply write down any old answer. \n\nAs you can see below, we have two distinct parts:\n\n>*Part A: How might compassioneous be described*\n>*Part B: As being thoughtful*\n\nThese words are meant to be considered separately and as a unit. This is crucial to remember when giving an answer. This isn't a case of simple word replacement or substitution.\n\nWhen asked to describe a verb with another specific word, you can use other types of specific words.\n  * noun-noun\n  * adjective- verb\n  * verb- adjective\n\nNotice that we are always talking about compassionate, not about thoughful.  \n\nTo evaluate our options, I'll break down each", "answer": "D: kind"}

She lost it on something.\nQuestion 3 - what she thought would she get on the spool  The spool was already half-empty, so Sally thought that there was more.\n\nQuestion 3: When did the kite fly? - Sally lost the kit in the place where it was flying.\nQuestion3b: What did Sally think was in the spool? The spool was alrready half-empty, so she thought there's more.\nStep 4 : Go back and analyze the given options. Option A: Sally lost the kitt because Sally doesn't think there's more on the spool - because it's empty.\nOption B: Sally lost her cat because Sally thought that there there was more on the spoo - when there's already half empty.\nOption C: Sally lost her  Cat because she thought that there was mored on the spoo. There's nothing on the spool, so the correct answer is B: Sally lost the Cat because she thought that she's going to get more string on the spoon - which is empty.\n\n### Input 2: The spool was already empty of string, so Sally thought there was more. She was careful not to slip her fingers through the loop - otherwise, she would have lost the kite for real. She thought she heard string rasping across the cardboard. It was probably the string slipping from the empty spool that she heard. What did Sally think the problem was?

{"text": "The question states that they were Bob\u2019s Pokemon cards, which means that they were Pokemon cards that Bob owned. Bob thought that they were common and worthless because he thought they were Pokemon cards common enough that people in his town would have them too. Therefore, the Pokemon cards he thought to be common were not rare like his neighbors had, but they were instead really rare because they were very valuable.\n\nAnswers:\n\nPokemon cards are trading cards owned by players who play the Pokemon video game. These cards have value and can be traded between people. Pokemon cards that are common are so common that many people own them, and their value is very low. One example of a common Pokemon card is Charizard, a card whose worth is less than a dollar on online auctions. Pokemon cards that aren't common and are rarer have higher values. For example, there is a rare Pokemon card named the First Edition Trainer No 1, which has a value of more than $4,000 on online auctions, 100 times more expensive than Charizard. Pokemon cards that players consider rare are usually shiny like the First Edition Trainer because shiny Pokemon cards have higher values. An example of a shiny card is Venusaur's GS 18, which has an estimated value of $800 or more on online auctions. \n\n### Input : What type of breath makes noise, but doesn't indicate you're sick?

This is a common sentence fragment, because it laces the part of speech in brackets. We can rewrite it as \"The following statement [is a] sentence fragment.\"\nStep 3.

The app provided a choice for noise and an animal sound. It then provided a choice for whether it was correct or not. The final questions asked for the correct answer, which I then wrote it out below with descriptions. The purpose was to evaluate the correctness of the answers to the earlier questions whereby the app responded. \n\nThe first app provided the question: \u201cWhat often happens after a lengthy day of travel, specifically by plane?\u201d\nMy response: \u201cA. sickness\u201d\nThe next choice it gave was \u201cB. motion sickness.\u201d \nMy response: \u201cC. relocation.\u201d It stated the explanation: \u201cThe traveler is not sick, so sickness is ruled out as an option. Motion sickness is a physical effect rather than a long term condition. Therefore, the answer must not be sickness. Relocation is associated with traveling and not with being ill. Sickness could be said to be associated with jet lag. Although it happens, it doesn\u2019t often occur, so it is probably not a primary symptom of a lengthy day of being on a plane, and also doesn\u2019t have to do with travel, so is easily ruled out. Therefore, being relocated is the choice that most fully meets the criteria outlined in the question.\nThe following options were provided: A: sickness, B: motion sickness, C: relocation, D: jet lag E\u201d fatigue.\n\nThe second App provided the question: \u201cWho has the sharpest teeth in the wildlife world?\u201d\nMy response:\u201dA: predators\u201d\nThe next choice provided was \u201cB: sharks.\u201d\nMy response: \u201cNot predator.

First of all, i tunes application requires an apple account to use, thus if you don't have one, or the account is deleted for security, you won't be able to use that app.\nStep 4. We know that a blank password won't work since an android phone needs the owner's password to unlock it.\nStep 5. Try a password reset will work. When you log out a mobile phone and log in to a new account, if you find that another account is already logged in to that device and it is required to enter the password for that particular account, the phone screen will display a password reset request. In this case, we will try with a password reset and if it works, we will get on to the next step. If the reset is successful, the phone will be unlocked.

Therefore, a person is not likely to be a hero if death is involved.\n* If  the hero is not someone who saves the lives, we do not know the extent of the hero's battle nor if the battle is considered as a tremendous one. \nConsider \"putting their families and friends in danger\":\n* If the hero is not someone saving the lives of people, they may not have put friends and family in danger.\n\nTherefore, the answer is  A: someone who saves people's lives and then dies mysteriously.\n\n**Answer:** A: someone who saves lives and then dies mysteriousely.", "answer": "E: class room"}

Write a response that is appropriate for that task and includes the correct answer. \n\n### Input\nIn a study of the behavior of wild chimpanzees, scientists found that the dominant chimp in a group, an adult male, would punish young chimps whenever they challenged the adult male's position in the group. The scientists gave the following examples of the punishment given:  If a young chimp challenged the dominant male by rushing at him, then he would either push the chimp out of the way or use his long arms to prevent the challenge. If a young chimp did something a little less aggressive, if he, for example, just wagged his lips at the dominant male, then the dominant male would slap him lightly with his hands or with his tail.\n\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### Choice A\n\nWe can determine that the punishment given in the above scenario is A - if the young chimp challenges the dominant male by running to him he will either push him away or use his long arms. So we can eliminate options B, E, and F.\n\n### Choices B and C\n\nAccording to the scenario, C - \"slapping him lightly with his hand\" is not correct, since the dominance is given by the dominant male. Slapping a young chimp with his tail, however, is not a dominance signal, but a punishment given by the dominant male for challenges or acts of disrespect. We can eliminate D - slapping a young chimp's tail as part of the punishment.\n\n### Answer\n\n* The most appropriate choice is C: slapping a young chimb with his tail\n\n### Input 2:\nGiraffes eat leaves, and lion's eat meat, and zebras eat grass.

{"text": "As I walked out of the room, all I could think was that I was leaving a nightmare. It always happened. After working so hard to get something right, I always seemed to take two steps back. There would be another room to fill and another room to decorate. I had no choice. The house had to be finished today, and that meant me moving into my third room in as many days. When I entered the house, I found there was very little in the rooms, except the furniture that had been left behind by the previous tenants. My old friend, Teddy, had told me to get the bedroom ready before getting anything else. Teddy\u2019s advice was always good. However, every time I stepped into the room, I found it to be cold and damp. The night before, I had thought about making a fire, but after a long day, I had felt too tired. I had been tempted to stay up a little later just to make something to help me through the night. Instead, I spent some time trying to work on one of my art assignments. But I couldn\u2019t stay up because I had a class early in the morning. The bedroom, with its cold hard tile floor, felt even worse to me in the morning than in the evening. I didn\u2019t like the idea of getting up and stepping onto that floor. It wasn\u2019t bad enough that I would have to step on the cold hard tile every morning and every evening. In order to warm it up a bit, I decided to get an electric heater and move it to the bedroom. It would give me some warmth for a while, but also, hopefully, help me fall asleep. By the time the sun came up that day, I was eager to get back to painting. I picked up my paintbrush and went in to my room. As I sat on the hard tile and painted away, my mind began racing. My heart pounded as I stared at the blank canvas. When someone stepped into their house, they immediately felt its welcoming warmth as they stepped across those very same tiles. It was so easy and so natural for someone to fall asleep and wake up fresh every morning in order to face the long days ahead.\n\nAs I turned over in bed, I began to notice strange sounds coming from the kitchen. I could hear muffled conversations and laughter among the appliances.", "answer": "B: bedroom"}

{"text": "### Rationales:\n\n### Input A: What is the opposite of foolish? Choices:  C: foolish B: careful D: intelligent E: careful\n\n\n### Rationale: Bears are animals that are mostly found in the northern hemisphere. Bears are used as mascots on many American college and professional sports teams.\n\n### Answer: The first thing to do is determine the purpose of the question. In this case, you are asked to find a synonyms for two words.\n\n### First, we look at the second choice, \u201cfoolish\u201d. It means acting rashly or impulsively without considering the consequences. It is usually used as an insult to describe someone acting rashly or recklessly. Some options can be eliminated. For example, option D, \u201cintelligent\u201d, is definitely not the correct one. Someone who is \u201cintelligent\u201d is usually neither \u201cfoolish\u201d nor \u201cthoughtful\u201d to any degree.\n\n### Options B: Careful and A: Thoughtful are somewhat reasonable choices, but neither is correct. Careful does not mean \u201copposite of foolish\u201d, as suggested by the question. Being \u201cthoughtful\u201d means being careful, deliberate, or having considered something. There\u2019s no reason we should look at \u201ccareful\u201d and \u201cthoughtful\u201d as opposites, any more than \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d.\n\n### Option C: \u201cCareful\u201d is very similar to \u201ccareful\u201d. We could eliminate \u201ccareful\u201d and look for another option with \u201ccareful\u201d in the words, like \u201ccautious\u201d, \u201ccalculated\u201d or \u201ccalculators\u201d.

There is ample evidence that humans are capable of observation, especially observation about their physical surroundings. An example of observational learning can be seen when a child first picks up an object and explores and manipulates it. As an adult, you have learned through observation how to pick up, hold, drop, and look at objects. This is what is referred to as motor learning, and it is a type of observational learning.\n\n### Your Response:\n```\nIt is safe to say that humans have a capacity for observational learning because they learn so much from their physical surroundings, a type of observational approach.\nWe typically observe when a child is first introduced to an object and how they tend to explore, manipulate, and even look at it. As an adult we have already learned about picking up, holding, dropping, and examining objects, which is what is referred to is the case of motor learning, a form of observational learning.

{"text": "Input: If a person does something to someone else, they might __________? Choices: A: feel sorry B feel trustful C: cross street D ride a bike E lend money\nRationale:\n1. Choice A feels sorry has 2 different meanings, and the one we need to use is the one that makes sense in the context of the question.\n2. If a person does something hurtful to another person, they _might_ feel sorry, since it goes along with the question, therefore a might fits in the blank.\n3. Choice B feel trustful does not make any sense in this context.\n4. Choices C cross street D ride a bicycle E lend money are similar in the way that the phrase \"might do\" can describe this. But we should eliminate those since the phrase \"do(s) something\" is already there. Hence, the correct answer is A: feel sorry.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input:\"Avoid taking pictures at the top of the mountain as you may risk your life.\"\nWhat would be a good way to capture photos?

At any place on the mountain\n\n### Response:\"Avoid taking pictures in the valleys as it is dangerous to walk alone.\"\n\n### Rationale:\nIn the given sentence, avoid taking pictures at the top is highlighted and since we are given some other choices, choose the good way to capture photos instead. In choosing to do this, we should eliminate A. From Choices B, C and D we can eliminate C because it's redundant after D and eliminating of Choice D. Since the sentence does not mention an action towards Choice E, we can eliminate it. Thus, the answer that we can choose from are Between Choices A and C and D. We want to eliminate C because A and C are both at the top of the Mountain while D is in a position close to the top. We can choose C if we consider the danger is higher for A since it is at the top for pictures, but at the bottom for walking.\n\n### Answer:\nA.

Choices: 1. syllable 2. prefix 3. suffix 4. accent 5. intonation\nRationales: The two obvious choices, suffix and prefix, occur in English words, but the teacher is most likely to refer to them in relation to vocabulary and writing, not speaking. \nFor example, one can add a prefix such as \"un-\" to a word in a sentence, but not in speech. As for accent and intonation, they are not words. They are used in speech, such as stress and intonation patterns but are not referred to in the context of vocabulary and spelling. Only syllable and accent are used in the same way and so are the best choices.\nAnswer: 1. sy\n\n### Input\nInput: what would a basketball player do if the ball got stuck in the net? Choices: \t1. take a free throw 2. take a shot 3. take a point 4. take a penalty kick 5. take a penalty shootout\nRationales: A player has three choices if the ball gets stuck in a basketball net: take a free throw, take a shot, or take a penalty shootout. A free throw and a shot are ways to score points, while a penalty kick refers to awarding a point to the opposing team. These ideas should help in the elimination process. First, all three of these choices are possible things a player can do when the ball gets stuck, so option one can be eliminated. Second, out of the three remaining options, choosing 2 is a possibility since a point could be scored, but the phrase, \u201ctake a shot\u201d, does not include any other ideas. This option can  be eliminated. \nThe final options are 3 (take a point) and 5 (take a penalty shootout). \nOption 3, take a point, refers to a basketball player scoring a point when the ball is put in the net. It is the correct answer, as the options that could be selected from were all possible things that a player can do when a ball gets stuck in the net.   \n\n### Instructions:  \nAnswer the following multiple choice", "answer": "C: jar"}

{"text": "Input: What is it called when you cook food while not watching it? Choices: 1. A: grilling B: barbecue C: baking D: boiling E: roasting\n\n### Rationales 1. To clarify and answer the question, we must first de\ufb01ne what \"grilling\" is and how people normally do it: Cooking on a grill. 2. To clarify and answer this question, we must first look into and understand what \"grilling\" means and usually consists of. We must also use reasoning to exclude those options that do not make sense to the situation. If we use the context of this situation, barbecue is not what the questioner is asking about because barbecuing is done at a barbeque. So those options that consist of 'barbecue' must be excluded. 3. Using inductive reasoning, options A & B both have the word 'grill' in them. However, those options also tend to be used for cooking outside. Since this question mentions it is in a kitchen, the options not involving barbeques are automatically excluded from the answer. 4. When it comes to cooking food in a kitchen, one does not have to watch every single progress. Thus, option D must necessarily be excluded. 5. In a situation involving cooking food while not watching it, barbecuing the food would be very time consuming and very difficult. Therefore, the options involving barbecues must also be excluded. 6. When it comes to something like barbecue, which normally consist of multiple people cooking food together, baking food would be the slowest option to cook the food. Thus, option E, as well as D must also be excluded from contention. 7. Therefore, the question is asking us to choose between baking and roasting. Thus, the answer must be C: baking.\n\nAnswer: C: baking\n\n### Instructions:Answer the two multiple choice questions based on this passage\n\n### Demostration:\n\n### Instructor: Please take out a piece of paper and begin reading\n\nRead:\n\nLittle boys and Littie girls make mud pies in their yards,\nAnd sometimes the big mud pies aren\u2019t any fun.

Choices:  Yes No\nRationales: The answer is not the same as the question because there is an assumption that the sponge is meant to be water-tight. \nThus, the answer is no. The statement 'A sponge is water-tight' might mean that the sponge will not absorb water. However, the question 'Is a sponge water tight?' implies that the sponge should contain all the water and not absorb any. The rationale for this approach is that if the person has a sponge that is water-tight, and asks 'is this sponge water tight?', the answer of 'No' would make sense as the sponge would already be perfectly water-tight.\n\n### Reference:\n\nhttps://github.com/taylorjwu/Water-tight-Sponges/blob/master/Readme.md\n\nhttps://githubusercontent.com/taylorwu2020/Water-ticket-Sponges/master/Readme/readme.md", "answer": "B: love"}

However, there are still instances where both a hardware store and the engine can also be thrown.\n\n    We can eliminate choice E: We can eliminate choice E since sporting goods stores do not sell fishing rods. \n\n    We can also rule out choice C: since engines usually do not get thrown.\n    Therefore, choices left are B Hardware Store and D Your Spine. \n\n    However, it is most likely that choice B is correct, because of the following reasons:\n        1. B is more specific than the others, describing a store that sells materials for building/construction. \n        2. D Damage to one's spine sounds serious enough that it is not likely someone would choose B. \n        2) D damage your spine is unlikely since a person would not likely throw one of the above items at their spine which is located in one's back, not in their face or chest directly. In some cases, damaging their spine may be as serious as a broken leg if it does not heal quickly, so it is unlikely to occur. \n        - Hardware vs Engine:\n        3. Most people who would throw a rod at someone or something would likely choose to throw a rod made of wood or metal, which is more likely to cause damage to the hardware than damaging the engine.\n        4) An engine could harm a person, but the damage would be due to fire/flames or other issues more than someone getting hurt by the engine itself.\n\n        Since engine damage is not likely, therefore we are left with:\n\n        - B & E: The items available in B and E do not meet all of the qualifications of choice - so choice E, Sports Goods Store, may be correct.\n       \n        - B (More information):\n        5) Additionally, we can rule out B because sports goods stores do not sell rods in the United States, and in the United States, people are more likely to throw a stick used in fishing (usually with a fish", "answer": "C: engine"}

It lives in the greater tropic ocean region and tends to be located in relatively warm waters with a salinity value of 1.0%. \n\nIn contrast, pufferfish sold as food are typically farmed in aquatic facilities and are bred for commercial purposes, where they are kept in tanks or in the water and thus do not live free. \n\nIn terms of the blowfish\u2019s lifestyle, he does not currently live in the pet shop, because he never lived in one. \n\nAs a predator, the blowfish eats a wide variety of foods found underwater, and he spends most of his time living freely in the greater tropic oceans.

It contains caffeine, which is well known for enhancing the human body's capabilities of being alert and focusing. It is also a natural source of energy for a person's body: many individuals consume caffeine at a large amount (especially in coffee). However, caffeine affects everyone differently. If the individual does not consume coffee regularly, they may consider consuming half the amount in the beginning and gradually increase it.\n### Coffee may not be what the human body needs, so a person must take this into consideration when making a decision.\n\n### Answer:\nStep 1: First, we need to identify the type of breaths that produce sound: sigh, yawn, cough\nStep 2: There are two types of sounds that might be heard when people breathe: cough and clavicular.\nStep 3. From the given choices, cough, clavicular and yawn are types of breath that produces sound.\n\nEliminate: Since a cough usually happens when somebody is sick, so, it can\u2019t be the answer. \n\nYawn: Yawn can indicate sickness\n\nStep 4: Yawn does not necessarily indicate illness. So, we have to eliminate clavicular from option and so our final choice is a sigh.\n\nStep 5: A sigh always generates a noticeable sound.

In C, it says \"fear and anxious\" and it doesn't make sense because fear and relaxed are not the same. Also, in D, it says \"relief and anxiety\" and \"calm relief\" doesn't make any sense, so we can eliminate that option too.\nNow that we have eliminated five options, only A and E is left to look at the answer. We can see that A implies that \"anxiety can be a way to calm yourself\" and E implies that \"a way to feel calm is to feel anxious.\" So finally, we can conclude that the answer is B - \"fear and peace.\"\n\nAnswer: B: fear and peace\n\nInput: What will the word \"momentum\" describe when it is applied to any object or item in space?

It says momentum describes the quantity of kinetic \nenergy. Momentum is defined as the product of a mass and a velocity. The velocity can be expressed as the product of the mass times the acceleration, so we know momentum is equal to mass multiplied by the acceleration. \nNow it is not specified when the momentum is the quantity of kinetic of potential or the total momentum. \nSo in the given context, the momentum should be the quantity of kinetic in space because the speed is related to space.\n\nAnswer: B : The quantity of KE\n\nInput:", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}

A helm is not something like a hat, a helmet, or a protective cap; it is also not some type of protective cap or covering for the head or neck. \nA helm is more narrowly defined as a term which refers to moving parts of a sailing boat.\nIf we carefully look at the choices, then, we can eliminate B Paddleboat, C Ship, and D Motorboat from C Ship.\nIt is very commonly known that a helm is the part of a boat where a helmsman or Captain sits down and moves the mast through various mechanisms. \nPaddleboat is not a sailing vessel. Neither is a tugboat. \nIf we check the wording, if the helm was on a paddleboat, then moving the mast would be equivalent to moving the paddle, which we know is impossible. \nIf the helm were on a tugboat, the answer cannot be \"sailing vessel\" because we cannot move masts on tugboats. Therefore, the answer to this question is A: sailing ship.\n\nAnswer: A: sailing ship\n\n### Input-\n\n- We live on what?\n### Step-1\n#### Step-1.1\nExplanation:The question \u201cwhat do we live on\u201d means the type of food, the thing from which we derive.\n#### Step-1.2\nThe definition for the word \u201clive\u201d is as an idiom means to survive; the meaning behind this idiom does not relate to human beings only.\n\n- We live/survive on what?\n\n#### Step-1 3\nThe question also states \u201cwe live on it\u201d and when we analyze the question, it can refer to animals, insects, living beings, and humans.

We can do this by understanding the function of the statement, which is to explain why the person disliked mosquitoes. The important element in this is that the insects make what. 2. From the list given, we can rule out A, B, and D, which can't make something. 3. From C, we can see \"make\" indicates that the insect moves around and creates a sound, not that it produces honey or pollenates flowers. Also, mosquitoes don't produce honey or help flowers pollenate, so we eliminate E. 4. From those that fit, we can see they make a sound, which indicates that choice C is correct. \n\n### Input:\"I awoke in an alley, with no clothes and with a dead dog in my right hand.\"  What is the narrator?

Choices: 1. A: rock music B: oldies C: hard rock D: soul music E: country\n\n\nRationales:Step 1: From the given choices:\n* A: rock music, oldies and hard rock are all types of music, but none of them come on specifically when elevator arrives at one\u2019s floor.\nStep 2. We can eliminate those options.\n* B: Oldies is music from the earlier part of the 20th century.\n* C: Hard rock is not used when an elevator arrives at floor.\nStep 3. We are left with the two options.\nStep 4. We know that the elevator only arrives at one\u2019floor.\nStep 5. One could use country as music or as a style or genre. Elevator is used in country music, but only country music should be an option.\nStep 6. So the answer would have to be B\nNow the question is: What kind of music comes on ELEVATOR?\nThe Elevator itself is a specific kind of machinery, so we can immediately eliminate rock music, soul music, and classical music because those are not things that play in an elevator.\nThe last three choices are types of music, but all have to be types of music that play on ELEVATORS. This narrows down our choices to B, HARD ROCK and Country.\nBut it does not matter what specific music type plays on elevators, only whether you can hear it when an elevator arriv an individual floor. Since this question is asking about country music, we can eliminate country music and hard rock.\nWe have only B and B, therefore B comes on elevators.\n\n### Input What is the most basic task that needs to be done by a human to get by in a world of machines?

{"text": "A \n### Reason: A: Wine is found at a bar or at a restaurant\n\n### Rationale: For the following, a 'bar' can be synonymous with a restaurant in some cases, but also can be a specific establishment which offers alcoholic beverages, which can include wine. \nWhile each of the four remaining options have their own connotations with wine, none can really be found at each of the given locations.\n\n### The only choices that describe an establishment that offers wine or alcohol of the like are: \n    A: bar,\n\tB: restaurant,\n\tC: church(s), and\n    D: art show.\n\nAn art show, or museum, can show wine related items, but such an art show can't really offer wine to a customer to drink. \n\nRestaurants can do this, however, so are a prime candidate. They can sell wine to individuals, so that rules out D, church.\n\nThe rest of the possible places to buy a cup of wine are A, B, and C.  Churches are locations for weddings, and can also hold events, but there isn't really a cup of wine at church attendees can drink as they're there.\n\nA bar is where people go to get a drink to drink, and you can't really get wine in a bar since you'd be asked to leave, at least in the real world. \n\nBut restaurants can have wine available to you if you're dining there, so the restaurant is the only choice that makes sense.\n\n## Rationale:", "answer": "C: bar"}

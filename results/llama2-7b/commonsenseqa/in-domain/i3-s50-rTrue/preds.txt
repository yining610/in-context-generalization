Choices:  A: carpet B: refrigerator C: breadbox D: fridge E: coach<n><n>### Response:		<n>Rationales: It's obvious that he's talking about his fridge, but he used a synonym for it: "What". This can happen pretty easily. You might forget the name of someone you know quite well. So instead of asking a friend, maybe you go, "What's going on?" instead of, "How's it going?" Just be a little careful, and you can get around this question easily.<n><n>### Response 2: <n>This question is a little more confusing than most ACT question because the word "what" doesn't refer to something in particular. Instead, it can refer to someone or something in general. If someone comes up to you and says, "What, hey buddy?" they are most likely just being friendly.

Choices:  A. reads B. reading C. who reads D. read E. is read<n>Rationales: A: The subject (the man, who is going to read...) is the plural (“they” in my version). A sentence is about an uncountable noun (going to read) that has a singular verb (read) — and that would be grammatical. <n>B: The object in this sentence is singular. (The article is the object of be.) However, the verb is singular, the verb is wrong.<n>C: The object (going to read the last article) is plural, and the verb (is going...) is plural, but the predicate subject is not plural, so it’s grammatically wrong.<n>D: The object (going...), the predicate subject, and the verb are singular here, meaning that you don’t want a plural verb.<n>E: Not only does this have a plural predicate subject (reads is incorrect here), but the word order is off.

Find the final answer by eliminating the false and incorrect choice.<n>Step 3.a. As you can see after determining the subject is Dinner that Living Longer does not follow it at all because it is not living longer that will result in stomac aches but is stomach ache which is not even close to it.<n>Step 3b. The same to stomach ache and illnes is not related to the dinner since illness is not a condition that will result in stomaach ache<n>Step 3c. Acid Reflux is a disorder which is a state a being so it is not related to the subject at all.<n>Step 3d. Therefore Tiredness is the closest result to the question as it is a result of having too much dinner.<n>Step 4.

In fact, the sentence refers to a specific type of person who gives their direct opinion, so the what is singular here.<n>Step 3 : Now, we can examine the five options listed above.<n>Step 4- From these options, A and D are not the answer because they refer to what a person is thinking, not telling another person their opinions.<n>Step 4- C, B, and E are all describing an individual. Therefore, we should eliminate them. <n>Step 5: This leaves A and E as choices to choose from.<n>Step 6

Choices:  A: hang up B: respond C: contact D: answer E: attracting ducks<n><n>### Response:		<n>> This one's easy. "Hoping people would what _______ his offer" is an erroneous way of saying, "Hoping people _______ his offer." The meaning is clearly "Hoping people wouldn't respond to his offer." So I'll eliminate A, B, and C, and then get the rest of the way by process of elimination. I don't suppose anyone would "contact" a salesperson to decline a product or service. Also no, someone would not "answer" a salesperson even if, technically speaking, we might define this by saying, "One must answer a polite 'no'" or "I might answer, 'Yes!' to a person we don't trust and then tell them I don't want it anyway." That takes it out of the scope of all reasonable responses. So we must conclude that no one can "attract ______ ducks," and the answer can hardly be "ducks," could it? So the only answer left is "what" because the correct expression is "Hoping people won't do what ________ his offer." But the person didn't want people to what. He wanted them to say "no" to his offer because he knows it would attract a lot of ducks. You should be able to get an "A" by being clever enough to answer by process of elimination, and I must say that the process itself is not complicated. So it shouldn't be too difficult to get an "A", even if you have to try a couple of times to get used to it. The only problem with the game is that the game doesn't require a lot of information. <n><n>### Input" The city has a long history. It used to be known for having a large manufacturing area and many other famous sports teams Choices:  A:" B:" C:" C:" D:" C:" <n><n>### Response" I think we're missing some information about this city and that's why we can't determine that it has a long history. I also don't understand why they're saying there were many sports teams and also "large manufacturing area." We don't know if it's only one or both because the word "and" is generally used in the plural, so I feel that the question is really asking for the answer "C:" and I agree

In a way, he was saying that these activities were impossible. The fact that he said that he does not know what simple activities he can still do shows that he has a problem understanding himself in simple terms. Choice A is not possible because in this sentence he already mentions no go and in B he already complained about the impossible. Therefore the correct choices are D, E and C. While choice C says he could not do these activities, choice D says Cant do, so option E is more correct since it says what he is doing and not what he is unable to do. The correct answer on this question is option E.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>The correct answer is E: impossibility

Choices:  A: violence B: falling down C: vomiting D: vomiting E: lower standards<n><n>### Response:		Answer: The answer is Choice C: Vomiting.<n><n>### Rationales: <n>1. Option A: Violence: This is when someone harms other people using violent means. This would be unlikely to happen after someone is drunk as they're more likely to become passive or less violent since they're already drunk. <n>2. Option B: Falling Down: This option refers to the act of falling down due to overconsumption of alcohol. Falling down is unlikely because it can be dangerous and unpleasant. However, if someone is already drinking alcohol and they continue to drink it, they can become more prone to falling down. They might also continue drinking alcohol even if they are over-consuming so much that it can make them pass out and not wake up until they're sober.<n>3. Option D: Vomiting: This option refers to vomiting caused by drinking alcohol and it is consistent with the information provided by a person who gets angry after getting drunken.<n>4. Option E: Lower standards: This option refers to lowering standards when someone is in a different state of mind. It's not clear how this differs from Option D, but they seem to have similar meanings. Lower standards when somebody is drunk might not be necessarily linked to any of the previous options and a better one would be lowering standards.<n><n>Output: What is a good sentence to describe being bored?<n>Rationales:<n> 1.

Choices:  A: living room B: dog park C: basket D: small apartment E: big house<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer is B: dog park! Dogs need to get exercise and socialization just as humans do, so taking them for a walk or to dog parks is a perfect way to maintain their physical and mental well-being!<n><n>### Detailed explanation<n><n>The question is asking for a location that is indoors and gives dogs plenty of space to play and run. In order to do this, we must first consider what spaces indoors that meet these requirements might be. First, it says that it "stayed strictly inside," so we must therefore eliminate any outdoor locations, such as a living room, big house or even a park. This leaves us to eliminate only the inside options of "dog park" and "small apartment," as a dog park is an indoor area where people can go to walk or play with dogs, and small apartments don't have enough space to comfortably fit a dog on its own. Lastly, we must choose the option that is both indoors and gives the dog space in which to roam and play. This leaves us with the only option of dog park. So, the answer is B: dog !<n>

In a city, city blocks are much smaller compared to the length of the entire city, and thus he might have easily been able to run across town on a city block, and therefore this answer must be what he ran.  The only other answer can be town as it might be possible for him to run across town, but this is not described in the story, so the only correct answer is D: city block.

It was already mentioned that at one location in the public means squash.<n>2. What they're asking about the meaning or purpose of the word public, and not a country club, rich person's house, or a pool, parks, or the fitness center because they have already specified that it is a squash court, not a fitness center, so that rule this out right away.<n>### Explanations:<n>### The first choice that was eliminated is option A. Country clubs and fitness centers are not specific to public places, and so this cannot be the answer.<n>### The second choice, Option B, can not be the answer because rich person's houses are not public places. Again, that is not what the question is asking.<n>### Option C, pool, is not an acceptable answer either because public pools and recreation centers are not the same thing.<n>### Option D, park, can be eliminated for the same reason that the country club above was eliminated. Option D is not a specific public place.<n>### Finally, from the choice given, the only acceptable answer is choice E: fitness centre. I know this because fitness center, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, is the only public thing that is included in the list. It is also used in the question. "One end of the public what" is just the same as "one end of the public fitness center" because they're the same type of place.<n>### Questions and Answers:<n>### What happened?<n>I went back to write the instruction on top of the task, and the response ended up disappearing.

What should you do in the event that a predator, such as an alligator, attacks when you're alone? Choices: <n>1. Don't run, turn away from the predator and look in the other direction.<n>2. Stay still and wave your hands, to show that you aren't prey.<n>3. Bellow loudly, to scare the predator away.<n>4. Run as fast as possible and do everything you can to avoid the predator.<n>5.

When you flee to the nearest water, it will also cause the predator to get wet by fleeing. The predator's natural instinct to avoid water will cause him to lose interest in you and flee from you, leaving you alone.<n>Step 2. When you get away from the predator, call for help or raise a sign. <n>Step 3: Find a safe tree to help you see. When the predator returns, it is more likely that the new predator will target the predator that pursued you, leaving you alone again. Return to where you fled.<n>Step 4. When the predator leaves, look for more signs that indicate prey nearby to avoid being targeted again. <n>Step 5. Continue monitoring nearby animals for signs of potential threats for the rest of the night. <n>Step 4.

The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick?

Choices:  A: refrigerator B: fridge C: freezer D: oven E: bought at store<n><n>### Response:		<n>When a turkey is spoiling it is usually referring to one already cooked. What the turkey needs is a "refrigerator" not any of the other answers. (refrigerate means to keep a food that has been cooked from spoiling.)<n><n>### Input : When someone is ill, what happens in their body? Choices:  a: the tube carrying food or fluid from the upper digestive system to the lower intestine b: tissue covering the outside parts of the digestive duct c: gastritis d: the pear-shaped organ that stores food and makes enzymes e: mucous membrane around the digestive duodenum<n><n>### Response :<n><n>The tube that carries food or fluid from the liver is what is being asked about. C is incorrect as it is the tissue that covers the outside parts of the body. The stomach is the organ, not the wall, in the above case as we are talking about the digestive process. Bile is stored in the gall bladder, not the stomach as shown in the question. Enzymes are produced by the stomach. The answer is A d the tube carrying food to the lower digestive tract.<n>

This can occur while running away. <n>Step 5b: Consider step E, Hunt for food. Running has always exhausted the body, which makes it more difficult for you to find food. If someone knows they are being chased by police, they will not think to hunt for food.<n>Step 6b: The person knew the police were chasing the person, so the only logical answer is to run away.<n>Step 7b: No need to continue if step 6b is selected<n>Step 8b: If step 6b doesn't match any of the choices - The person felt that the law was unfair and did not feel comfortable about it, so they chose the only alternative, either death or running away.<n>Answer:<n><n>### Input 2:What makes people do the right thing even if it can be dangerous? Choices: <n>A: They want to help people. B: because there are consequences. C: their ego is hurt.

Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:What happens when someone is playing too aggressively? Choices:  A: get hungry B: laughter C: injury D: having fun E: feeling happy<n><n>### Response:		The word "aggressive" means "too aggressive". The question is asking what happens to a person when they are playing too aggressively.<n>### Reason 1: There is no reason to think that laughter, injury, or having fun are the result of someone playing too aggressively<n>### Reason: Only "hungry" and "happy" make sense as a response. The only two things that we can "get" that are both a result of being too aggressive, which makes "hungry" a correct answer. <n>### Answer: C: injury<n><n>### Input : What happens when someone's ears are overwatered? Choices:  A : it goes down B: gets thicker C: shrinking D : gets shorter E : grows tinnier<n><n>### Reason : When humans get their ears wet, the earwax dries out. The question does not make sense because nobody's ears are growing or shrinking. <n>### Reason Two : There is no reason to believe "earwax" can grow or shrink. <n>##  Reason Three : "watery" as used in the sentence does not mean "soaked". <n>##  Reasons Four : There is no reason for "shrinking" or "shortening" to be selected because it's not about shrinking. <n> <n>### Step One  : When someone play music, their ears get over watered.<n>### Steps Two : The word "thinner" in the sentence makes no sense. <n>### Step Three: The word "grows" in the sentence makes little sense and should be excluded as an accurate choice. <n>### Why : If we are over watering earwax, then it shouldn't grow larger.<n>### Rationales Five : "C" is the correct answer because watering ears can make them smaller, thinner and shorter. <n><n>### Steps Four and Five : The "shrinking" and "shortening" should be the right choice because it refers to the human ear.<n><n>### Answer:C: shrinking<n><n>### Input  : What happens when someone is very sick? Choices: <n>### A: it gets dried out.<n>### B  : it gets tighter<n>##

The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick?

Choices : A : drinking B : intimacy C : dancing D : Happiness E : enjoyment<n><n>Celebrating the occassion means they are happy. But if they went out to enjoy themselves that doesn't indicate they were happy. Ie if they went out to drink then that is being happy but that doesn’t mean they are celebrating the occassions. Also, if they drink intimacy that will not celebrate the occassion as “intimacy” doesn’t means they are happy. Celebration means the occassion should be about something that is happiness. If it is about dancing then it’s not a happy occassion. If it’s about dancing for fun then ok that could be considered an occastion of happiness. But they don’t mention fun, they only mention “celebrating” which means they are thinking it as being happy. So the only answer that would be correct is A: “drinking”<n><n><n>```<n><n>Answer: Drinking - A<n><n>```

Where would he go to plug in? Choices:  A: toy store B: basement C: school D: rest area E: building<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer is option B. Toy store and Building are not correct because John's RV does not need a plug to operate. John's RV is a means of living which requires the use of appliances so school or rest area do not make sense as options. Toy store and Building do not need to be plugged in for the task at hand, which is Cooking. The correct answer is in option B which says basement.

Choices:  A: bathroom B: closet C: school D: room E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n>The text describes college students who are generally known to be a low budget and low quality student. In this case, the word 'decor' clearly refers to interior decor. In the context of the question, the other mentioned words are all either rooms or areas that are used to store objects which are too large to fit in the same room (eg. bathroom, closet). Since room and church can already fit in the given room, the answer D: room would be impossible.<n><n>### Rationales:  1. Bathroom and closet are not apartment rooms, but areas to store or house objects. 2. Church and room share the same meaning of area where one can spend time, thus a room is more specific than the common room, church. 3. The college children, with their "low budget and low-quality decors", can use room inside their apartment more appropriately than bathroom or church.<n><n>###  Answer:  D. their room.<n><n>### Input :<n><n>A: Where do humans go to a city to be in nature?<n>        B: What game is the player sent to the penalty box in?<n>        C: What kind of breath does not indicate you're sick?<n>Answers:<n>        A: Which is used as a term for a city?<n>        B: In boxers, you would get sent to the penalty box.<n>        C: Yawns are what sort of breath?<n>        D: Live can refer to breathing?<n>        E: Clavicular Cranes?<n><n>### Question:<n>What type of breathing is silent but indicates you’re sick?<n><n>### Context:<n>Question: Which is used as in terms for a city that is a common area for humans to be in nature? <n><n>### Rationale: 1.

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:What is a parents primary duty? Choices:  A: speak freely B: happiness of a child C: care for children D: school child E: control children<n><n>### Response:		Parents' primary duty is to provide food, shelter and clothing for their children. From the choices given, <n><n>the care for children has to be covered by the other parents or the people who are taking care of the children. <n><n>If parents would do their primary duty towards children, these choices would be eliminated.<n>The choice D school child is not correct because it's not the parents but the care giver who can control the children<n><n>Hence, the answer is B: happiness of a Child.<n><n>### Output: D: school child<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>What is the difference between a group and a team? Choices: A: number B: role C: membership D: leadership E: purpose<n><n>Step 1: 1. First, take notice of the context in which this question is posed. There are already options that are relevant to a sports game. For example, the choice E: purpose seems to be in the context of being on a team in a field game.<n><n>Step 2: 2. Examine the options one at a time.<n><n>Step 3: 3. Determine whether it is a group or a team.<n><n>Step 4: 4. Eliminate options by comparing them with the group in the context or the context itself.<n><n>Step 5: 5. By comparing the context, the answer can be found, as this is a group.<n><n>Step 6: 6. The answer is D: leadership, the most relevant option in this case.<n><n>Response: D: leadership<n><n>### Instructor's Review Guidelines<n>Think critically about the task for the student's response.<n>Congratulate the student for completing the task correctly.<n>Correct any problems in the student's response, keeping in mind they did not have your knowledge.<n>Clarify any missteps in the student's thinking by asking good questions.<n>Avoid being judgmental.<n>Ask open-ended questions that make the student think, and give the student time to respond.<n>Provide positive and constructive feedback and use words such as:<n><n>You<n>I<n>We<n>This<n>Here are the criteria I used to grade your response:<n>

This task involved the elimination of incorrect choices, based on the premise that a wild ride does not involve sickness.<n>2. To eliminate incorrect options, I used the rule of inference from enthymemes.<n>3. Also, I used rule of elision to understand that choices D and E are both forms of the verb "to play," so they needed to be combined into one choice.<n>4. I used the rule of transitivity with the predicate "to involve sickness" to eliminate choice A. By adding the rule of elision again, I was able to choose C over B, which is the more specific choice regarding what form of play.<n>5. Finally, I used rule of elimination to decide between constructing and constructing, since the question is about the end of play and constructing is only a form of play.<n>

Choices:  A: cattle ranch B: countryside C: grocery store D: slaughterhouse E: dairy farm<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1. Option A, cattle ranch, is not applicable as the farmer's compassion dictates that he will not have his cows slaughtered. <n><n>2. Option B, countryside, would contradict the compassionate nature of the farmer as it would likely result in the heifer's death.<n><n>3. Option C, grocery store, is an unusual choice to allow a cow to reside. It is more probable that the cow will be killed at whichever cattle ranch that supplies the cow to the grocery store.<n><n>4. Option D, slaughterhouse, is not applicable because the goal of the farmer is to save the heifer and keep her from the slaughterhouse.<n><n>5. Option E, dairy farm, would likely be an inconsiderate option as the farmer would have to be willing to take care of the heifer until she reached adulthood, which would likely be contrary to the business of a dairy farm.<n><n>#### A. Cattle Ranch:<n>6. Therefore, we can eliminate the two incorrect choices as the three remaining choices have not been disproven and appear viable options.<n><n>7. The heifer could reside on the farmer's cattle ranch, as the farmer would not have the heifer killed.<n><n>####B. Countryside:<n>8. Therefore, by process-oriented elimination we can determine that option B, countrysider, cannot be the solution as it is inconsiderate of the farmer's wishes to not save the heifer. <n>Thus, we can eliminate Option B and determine that both Options A and C are viable choices. <n><n>9. An additional piece of information is that Option C has not yet been disproven, therefore it remains an option.<n><n><n><n>10. There is an assumption that the farmer believes the cow has value due to her quality and the emotional connection the farmer shares with the cow. <n>11.

Option C, groceries store, was introduced to disprove the two previous options by process of rule.<n><n>13. Option C

Singing, for that matter, is not performed solely by a<n><n>### Human vocal cords, but the human mind, through musical notes.

However, if the person doing that act were to scream, or sing, it might not be enjoyed by the afore-mentioned group, because it requires hearing. <n><n>## A: If the performer were deaf, the act would not be enjoyable. To get the point across, the person performing the act would have two choices: scream or dance. These two options are the only one he / she has. This is because "doing" an act cannot be a passive thing, it has to be expressive, too. Otherwise, there would be no act done and the word "do" would not exist. Another thing the performer has to do is make a physical reaction. However, all possible physical reactions in this situation could have some form of singing. This might be "dancing", "jumping", etc. <n><n>## B: To enjoy the aforementioned act(s), one has to listen to it. To listen to it, there must be sounds. <n><n>## C: As previously discussed, the aforementioned performer, and a lot of performers in the past, have been deaf. For some reason, they still can do their job. The reason is that their talent is what makes them deaf. <n><n>## D: The aforementioned group would not be able to enjoy any act involving the act(s). If someone is dancing, it is because his/her soul has to be in contact with the dance. The same is with singing. There is a certain thing someone has to "do" before singing: "listen". <n><n>## E: The afor

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick?

Choices:  A: ouch B: skip C: enjoyed D: awesome E: watch television<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The children exclaimed "Superman".<n>2. Superman is not an object, so that can be eliminated.<n>3. From remaining choices "enjoy" and "watch television", it is evident that superman is cool and is a superhero, so it is either "enjoyed" or "awesome/awesomely", but not "enjoy". Therefore, "awesome" is correct answer.<n>Answer: A or E: awesome<n><n>### Input : What kind of noise does a toy phone make? Choices: <n>A: clucking, bleating, roaring<n>B: ringing, buzzing, humming, mewing<n>C: click, clack, tweet, beep<n>D: yowling <n>E: twitter<n><n>### Response : <n>1. The given answer can be read as "ringing, buzzing etc." <n>2. Among the remaining answer choice, "clucking, bleating" and "yowling" are not noises, and "clack" is not a choice.<n>3. The correct answer therefore is "ringing, buzzi...,..."<n>Answer: A: Ringing, buzzing<n><n>###### **NOTE :   ** In this question, the solution is the same for all cases(a:, b:, c:, d:, e:), and a single solution in common for all the given cases. Hence, it will be marked as one wrong response no matter which option was selected. The solution is incorrect because the correct answer is always the combination of two choices(ringing, buzz...). It is always the answer, no matter which two selections for the choice were given.<n><n>###### ** NOTE :<n>* Please consider the use of this response for educational use and only.  <n>* We appreciate to be notified of inappropriate responses that are not educational.<n>* We will take actions to avoid them.

Then if you want to dump that in the outside garbage, just put the icebox body in the kitchen, put the ice in the freezer, and then put the broken icebox body in the outside garbage, because it's old. There is also a landfill junkyard, because landfills are for garbage, but garbage is not only just your daily trash, so that could be the antique store too.<n><n>* Icecubes belong in ice boxes, and you can only get icecubes from ice.

Choices: A: none B: two C: one D: four E: three<n><n>### Rationales<n><n>The key is to see the word "examines" in step 2. That is the clue that leads you to answer D: four. If the doctor did not examine the patient, then they would not need to know the number of symptoms present.<n>Additionally, step 2 shows an important definition of what a symptom is. "Symptom is a sign of a medical condition that does not necessarily have a physical cause." Thus, if a patient has a headache but no other symptoms, then there is no medical condition.  <n><n>Answer: D: four<n><n>## Instruced:Complete the task.

Choices: 1 A: caution 2 B: alert 3 C: notice 4 D: cue 5 E: clue 6 F: sign 7 G: instruction 8 H: hint 9 I: advisory 10 J: announcement<n>Rationales:<n>1. A word of warning means to imply caution against something.<n>2. A word of caution is to imply not to do something.<n>3. An alert means the same thing so also not a word of warning.<n>4. A notice can refer to something you need to remember, not a word of warning to do something.<n>5. A cue is a prompt or a signal, not a word of caution.<n>6. A clue is a sign or a hint about something you should do or not do.<n>7. An announcement is not a word of cautions.<n>8. A sign is not a word of warnings<n>9. A hint does not mean to do something, it indicates something indirect.<n>10. Finally, a word of instruction, while a type of word of caution, does not mean only a word of warnings, so it is still not the only option not to be one of those words of warnings. <n>11.

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time.

Therefore, the answer choice should be B, tomb.<n><n>Explanation2: Going through the remaining options, the arena, C, indicates a structure that has a specific function and does not involve a large amount of buried materials.<n>Also, based on the question, "much to their delight", it would be unlikely that they would have found a buried arena. The treasure, E, does not make sense as a structure. Therefore, the answer would be between B, tomb, and C, arena.<n><n>Since the tomb, B, required the explorers to go through a path towards the entrance, which also indicates a specific direction and location, therefore, the answer must be C, arena, which had been discovered by the direction in the question.<n><n>## Question:<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>## Demonstration:The demonstration below shows the steps to complete the task.<n><n>## Instructions:<n><n>### Demotiation:<n>A: Which of the following statements is true?

A'super market' is common terminology for "grocery store" or general merchant which may apply to a small chain or a large store and would not require placing any products inside.<n>3. A 'fruit basket' is not a check out location and cannot be used for placing goods.<n>4. A 'grape basket' or 'fruit basket' would not be used as the checkout area but would be the destination of the final basket of items.<n>5. Therefore, by rule of elimination, the correct answer is Fruit Market.<n><n>### Answer: Fruit Market<n>

Cubs are cubs, and they look the same as bears. F is a good answer for the bear.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>The correct answer is F.

Choices:  I. airplane<n>II. subway<n>III. airplane III<n>IV. ferry V. bicycle<n>VI. airplane VII. bicycle<n>Answer:<n>VIII. airplane.<n><n>We know that the city is called Boulder.  The city of Boulder, Colorado is known for "its outdoorsy environment."  Thus, it is not correct that "one way to get there" would be by  subways.  This leaves us with three remaining options:  flying, bicycling or a ferry.<n>Flying is possible and would not require a ferry.  Ferrying may be a mode of transportation for getting to Boulder, Colorado  but not "one way.. to [the] city." A bicycle could be a mode of transport there, as the route between Denver to Boulder is 37 miles and includes 1825 feet of climbing, but this would be a very long way to travel by bicycle to "the city."  We can therefore "eliminate A, C, D, and E."  "A person should travel there by flying, not bicycling." The answer is either B or F.<n>From "City of Boulder's Topography Map", it shows that the city of Boulder is in an area called Boulder Valley.  Thus, "One could take the ferry to the Boulder Valley" because it is the nearest water.  Although the city is near a large reservoir, Boulder Reservoir, this area is not part of either Boulder City or Boulder Creek.  Since "the Boulder Creek Area" and "City of Boulders Landscape" are near both the city and the reservoir, the answer would be in that area. A ferry is the best way to reach the city of Boulders Landcape.  This is a perfect response.<n><n>### Sample Responses<n>The following are from the sample responses.

In the scenario of playing sports without competition, one would still have fun and possibly even a competitive edge because the focus is primarily on enjoying the activity. <n><n>### Instructions:Complete the following sentence.<n><n>### Student's response: It is unwise to____________ when it is in the past.<n>### Instructors response: The question is asking if it is wise to regret the past when it has already occurred. However, the answer suggests that regret should not also be applied to the future. <n>### Instructor's response: The word regret is not appropriate in the context of this question. Rather, the context suggests that the instructor views regret or remorse as a possible response to the past or recent memories, whether good or bad. <n><n>## Instructions: <n><n>### Student response: Why does the narrator use the word "cadet" often in the story?<n><n>### Instructor response: The narrator, as a pilot, is using the word `cadet` as a signification of `trainee`. The word `cadet(t) ` refers to a young boy or girl learning about something important to them. The cadet at hand is being trained to fly. Therefore, the response will be B: as a signification of trainee.  <n><n>### Instuctor response (after feedback from another)<n>### Instructores response: First of all, the correct answer in the list is "a word". In this case, I see that the word "cadets" in the story represents a form of trainee, and I can answer with B as the correct response. However, my feedback is that the entire process of teaching, quizzing, and feedback is rather slow and the speed of the teacher's voice in the tutorial video makes it more stressful than necessary, and the fact that the quiz has to be stopped for the tutor's feedback seems unnatural to me.  <n><n>## Student feedback (follow up question)<n>### Student response to the following: I understand if A is wrong because it is a word that doesn't make sense, but I think it does because it's a word of someone from the past and I think the use of that word indicates a time and a

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: study french cooking C: taste sauce D: prepare food E: thin sauce<n><n>### Response:		What do chefs do when working in an evening? Chef, meaning cook or culinary specialist, is someone who prepares food for people and in a kitchen. Given that the preparation of food refers to chopping, mixing and creating the food items, in the evening, a chef is cooking dishes for people to eat. It is generally not cooking your own dinner, as stated in choice A. <n><n>Chef is also not studying how to cook dinner or learning a recipe, as stated in choice B. Moreover, tasting sauce is a practice that tasters do. It is not an action that occurs to chefs that are usually working in the kitchen. It is also not correct to say that they are preparing food. <n><n>Thin sauce is not an action that a chef would do either. Chefs generally chop food, mix ingredients but do not thin sauce. <n><n>The same thing occurs with the remaining choices. They do not fit the description. Thus we can rule out <n>choice D, B, E and A. <n><n>The final answer is C: cook dinner.<n><n>

This cannot be said about names, hair, or brains as not all people born from the same parent share the same name, hair color, or IQ.</p><n><n>### Explanation<n><p>The given choices are not always required. For example, A and E are both used to introduce the concept of "person in the same family." The question asks "What do people in the <i>same family</i> often share?</i>. The answer must be shared by people born from the same parents. Thus, the question is to identify the things shared by members of the same family. So, B, C and D are not correct because these are traits that members of one family and those members of another family do/do not share. Only A and E consist of "things that people in the same family share." <n></p><n><n>##### Input: How does a person move in a hurry without walking?

Option A, oklahoma, doesn't necessarily go on a football field, as a field is 0-dimensional (flat) and Oklahoma is a state, which is 3-dimensional (round) shape.<n>	* 1. Option B, university, which is a 3-dimensional thing, doesn't necessarily apply either.<n>	* 2. Option C, college campus, however, does indeed relate to the question.

Hence, by process of elimintion, the answer is C: college campus.<n>	* Option D: players are who play on a football field, so it is one of the options, the other being College campus.<n>	* 4.

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:The hippy wanted peace with all humans, he had strong what for them all? Choices:  A: names B: words C: naval D: bladders E: feelings<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>```<n>This is a very difficult question to answer. This is what I’ve figured out: <n>First, I identified the verb to be, in this case it is all humans. I substituted the verb to be ‘people that he wanted peace with’. <n>Second, I identified the name of the subject, it is hippy. The noun ‘hippy’ was substituted for all humans. <n>Third, I identified the noun from sentence 2. It is peace and the noun is substituted for the noun ‘hippy wants’.  <n>Fourth, I identified the subject, it is the hippy as I replaced the verb, to be ‘hippy’ with the subject. <n>Fifth, I identified the verb, to have in sentence 2, and changed it to ‘had strong’ to match the verb in sentence 1. The subject ‘all humans’ is not the main subject but a pronoun. <n>Sixth, I identified the adverb, for in sentence 2, it is all. It is substituted for for, as it modifies all humans. <n>Seventh, the verb to be in sentence 2, is in the same relative position as the verb in the subject in the sentence 1. <n>The verb all humans in sentence 2 is in the relative position, it is a noun phrase, and it determines the clause where there is a verb phrase. <n>Eighth, in sentence 1, people is a noun. In sentence 2, people is a pronoun, but it is still a noun. <n>Ninth, I identified the relative position of all humans. It is in the pre-position, and it determines that the relative position of verb, which is a noun, is in sentence 1.<n>The verb had strong in sentence 2 is also in the relative position, which is why it modifies verb in the sentence, where there is a pronoun in the position. <n>The pronoun the in sentence 3 modifies hippy. The verb hippy is modified by pronoun, that is, for hippy. <n>I believe the verb is a relative pronoun. It does not start a relative clause but modifies a noun.

It follows with the word, "four", which is plural for the number, "four". The speaker mentions the presence of time, which may be "class". There is also the word are, which is plural, and may refer to classes. This indicates that many classes are taking place. <n><n>The word, "classes", is singular, so the speaker has either one class or multiple classes. <n><n>The speaker may take a nap while classes are ongoing to recover from pulling an all-nighter in order to complete some form of schooling at four in the morning. <n><n>## Solution<n>### Instructions:<n>Input: What is the result in a race?

Bury his money in the garage, since it can be destroyed by fire or moisture, this may leave him in a worse situation<n>2. Bury his money under the house. This could result in him digging up buried treasure.<n>3. Bury his money, like some gangsters do.

Bury his money as a joke since "I don't think anyone will find it...", even though that is not true<n><n>Finally left with only "Bury his money in the yard", which matches the scenario of the entire book. He trusts banks, he doesn't dig up buried treasure with gangsters, he would like some money to win the competition and bury in his yard makes this scenario much more realistic.<n><n>### Inference: An inference is something that can be deduced or inferred from something else.

What is a leader for? Choices:  b: a winner c: a teacher d: a team member e: a player f: a loser <n><n>### Response  : The best player makes the most kills or assists. Therefore he is a player. We can eliminate all other choice. Players play together to win or reach their goals. A winner wins a game or competition. This answer is also not correct. A team member plays together with the others (teams). Certainly players are the best players of the team. This should mean that they are the main ones too. A leader is someone who leads a team or group. This answer is the correct one.<n><n>### Final Response<n><n>### The best <n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where do humans go in cities to be in nature? Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:When he was a small child he called the giraffe mascot a cow, it was a fond memory of the now defunct what? Choices:  A: toy store B: story book C: great outdoors D: countryside E: wildlife refuge<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Step 1: What we were given: a statement where the speaker calls the giraffe masot a cow and recalls fondly an almost defunct what (given in choices)<n>Step 2: What they are not asking: what the giraffe masct is (the answer is D: giraffe) or what the fond memory of the giraffe mascot in a defunct what is (E: wildlife refuge)<n>Step 3: Answer, C: Great Outdoors. The speaker says the fond memory was that of the defunct what, not what. <n>The only available choice is an animal park.<n>Step 4) We know the speaker was once younger, because otherwise he wouldn't recall the event as a fond memory. <n>Step 5) Since the event happened in an animal park, it must have been defunct. <n>Step 9) The answer is C: great outdo door.<n><n>### Final Response:<n>The answer choices that are all given were not only incorrect but also misleading - for example, a cow is a completely different animal than a giraffe, so the choice A: toy store is incorrect.  Similarly, the choice C: great outdooor, is misleading because a great outdooor location would not commonly house a Giraffe mascot, it would instead be a children's park or a zoo, which could contain both. <n><n>### Final Answer:<n>A: toy store - incorrect<n>B: story book - incorrect<n>C: great outdoors - correct<n>D: countryside - incorrect<n>E: wild life refuge - incorrect<n>

It's the only option that starts with P, the letter in the box, because the others don't.<n><n>### Rational: Bold and capitalized the correct word.<n><n>### Recommendations:<n><n>1) The question, "where do humans go in cities...," and other questions could be refined to avoid confusion.<n>2) The instruction, "write a response that appropriately answers...," could be refined to ensure a valid answer.<n><n>### Difficulty: Medium<n>
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where do humans go in cities to be in nature? Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:Why might a person go to get counseling? Choices:  A: to be heard B: receive gifts C: understand themselves D: good things in life E: acknowledgment<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choices A, B, C, D and E have been eliminated because they do not involve any of the reasons to get counseling.<n>A person will not get counseling if they want to acquire gifts or the good life, nor will they go to be heard, because that can be done by talking to family and friends, who will listen intently.<n>People going to be heard would only be seeking counseling if they could not confide in loved ones, but that is not what the question is asking: it seeks to determine the main reason.<n><n>We can therefore say that a person goes to get counseling to understand themselves, and this is based on the answers that remain and the reasoning that follows them.<n><n>When a person goes to get some counseling, it means that they want to find an understanding, so that they can take control of and overcome their difficulties. <n><n>### Rationales:The last option left is "To understand yourself more" - that choice, however, is more than adequate in and of itself. <n>Thus, we can eliminate choices A, B, C and D. <n><n>The other choice that remains, "To receive gifts," is also not a valid option. While a person might go to seek counseling to receive gifts, it is not the same as getting counseling to understand oneself. <n><n>This leaves the option "Acknowledgement" as the correct answer. <n><n>Answer: A: To understand yourself more<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.<n><n>Input: The United States government sends foreign aid to countries on which continent? Choices: A: North America B: Europe C: Africa D: Asia E: Oceania<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>Eliminate A, B and D as 2 of the countries are in Europe (A and B), 1 is in Asia (D), and 1 is not in a continent (Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania).<n>This leaves us with the final answer choice of Africa (C), as the majority of the continent is located on the continent of Africa.<n><n>Answer: C: Africa<n><n>### Input : The movie "Home Alone" is a comedy.

Choices:  A: being happy B: glee C: smoke D: stress relief E: may laugh<n><n>### Response:		A, being happy<n><n>### Rationales:<n>1. The question asks you what someone would do if they were having fun, and A, being happy, indicates that someone is having fun.<n>2. Smoking is not a part of having fun for most people.<n>3. Stress relief is usually not a part of being happy for the majority of people.<n>4. Laughing is a sound that is made when someone is happy, so answer E: May Laugh cannot be the answer.<n>5. Glee and being happy overlap and the meaning of both is roughly the same, just the choice C: Glee is more specific in its meaning than A, Being Happy.<n><n>### Input (alternative):<n>Do people who are tired sleep? Choices: A: no, go to the gym B: Yes, rest  C-1: Sleep more D: yes, take an afternoon nap<n><n>### Response (alternative):<n>C-1: Sleep More<n><n>### Rationels (alternative):<n>1. The question clearly says "if people are tired". No one says that going to the gym will make them tired.<n>2. Going to a sleeping person and asking "Are you tired?" Will be an awkward question, and the question doesn't specify that it's only at night that rest is required.<n>3. The options are being either answered with Yes or No. <n><n>### Inputs:<n>1. How do people measure when to stop driving a car? Choices: A-1: They count the traffic lights. B-1: When they want to go for groceries! C-1: Counting the stop signs D-1: The traffic light in front of you. E-1: By the time it takes to travel a certain distance.<n><n>### Response(s) (alternative):<n>None of the above<n><n>### Rationale(S):<n>1. A-1 is clearly incorrect because the light count is not a way to measure how much time they have been at the wheel.<n>2. B-1 should be removed since it is obviously not the case that drivers only drive to the grocery store.<n>3. C-1 could be eliminated too, since most people don't measure driving distances with stop signs.<n>4. There are many people that drive for more than half

Every person who is great at (something) has focus and dedication, but not with the same intent.<n>		Focusing on something is not dedicating to something or vice versa.<n>2. The word “what” is not commonly used, and the correct answer should be a word with a common usage pattern.<n>4. The word is plural, thus “what” is wrong. “What to it” would be a sentence.<n>5. The given choices are not logical. For example, a person who is great at painting is focused and dedicated, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have luck. <n><n>### Answer:<n>To eliminate all incorrect answers, a focus and dedication are not the same thing.<n>In a combination of all the above rationales, focus and what would be an incorrect answer as "focus and what?" is the most common type of sentence.<n>A person who is great at  painting does not necessarily have "hatred" towards painting. A person who is great at swimming does not necessarily have "surprised"? at swimming. Neither does a person who is great 25 at swimming "hatred"? for 25,<n>In addition, "What to it" is not a common use to say "what to it?" in this context.<n>As a result, the answer is D.  Dedication requires focus and motivation to achieve a goal. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: dedication.<n><n>Input: What is bigger? The planet earth or the sun?

Choices:  A: grocery store B: grocery bag C: restaurants D: farmer's market E: bushel basket<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Rationale: C: 1. The definition of grocery bags is, "A carry-all bag usually sold in a supermarket or department store and used to put groceries in that one can take home." There is no mention of potatoes. There are many options that could be taken home such as fruit, vegetables, meat, etc. Therefore, the choice is not specific. 2. Farmer's markets do not carry potatoes, and potatoes would be sold in a grocery store rather than a restaurants.  3. The final answer is E. Bushel Basket: "A basket for carrying grain, fruit, etc." <n><n>Answer: D: bushel basket<n>

Here’s how.<n><n>**Step 1**: From the given choices we have to eliminate “A :front door” because no letters are missing, and no one has gained access to the house.<n><n>**Step**: We can also eliminate “D:package” because no one has gone through the package or stolen anything.<n><n>**Step2**  We can rule out “C: Post office” because there is no missing mail or letters in there.<n><n>At this point, we’re down to two choices, **E :mail box” and “B: newspaper box”.

E: put a blanket on you<n><n>### Task Response : The answer may be obtained by taking a deeper look into the question.<n><n>* step 1: First, let us eliminate choices “D : wear a scarf” and “C: wear a robe” for we will not cover ourselves in these items because they will make us look more visible.<n><n>* step2: Now we are left with options A,B and E<n>* step 3: We can eliminate option A as well because one cannot be completely hidden with a mask even though it is made to cover the whole face, also, this would require contact with other people and that may or may not become the issue depending on the person and the situation, as well as the environment where the masquerade takes place (behind the curtain is not the safest place to cover).<n><n>* step 4: Next, we can eliminate option B “Painting yourself with green paint” as it makes us more visible than anything. If someone tries to hunt for you then they will not look away as fast as before. Also, it would be hard to put green paint on oneself if one is already covered in green paint.<n><n>So, we are left with only E – “wear a blanket.<n><n>* We’

By the dictionary definition, a newspaper delivery refers to a person who delivers newspapers. A grocery store is a store that sells food and other household items. It would make the most sense for a grocery store because it sounds more general and would fit the bill. However, the answer must be consistent with the entirety of the text, therefore, any place where newspapers would be delivered outside of a grocery store would likely sound unfamiliar.<n><n>Additionally, one can argue that the answer should be grocery stores as opposed to grocery store since it makes the sentence more accurate and can't be easily confused with plural.<n><n>### Input 2<n>The problem states: "The referee called a f...":<n><n>This sentence makes _no sense_ at all.

For example, look at the sentence above. It is asking us to interpret as:<n>How can compassionate be described as being thoughtful?<n><n>However, look at this:<n>>*The Question in Context*: How might compasstionate thoughful be referred to as being?<n><n>This is a completely different question from the previous one, with a very different purpose. For example, we now have to guess how compassionate thoughfull could be referred to within a context. <n><n>In order for an answer to be considered valid, one would have to evaluate the following parts:<n>  * What does this question (or phrase) exactly mean?<n>  * How can I interpret this?<n><n>However, in order to answer this, we have to consider the context. We have to first understand what we are talking about. If we don't, we can't give a valid and appropriate response. <n><n>Let's take a look at what I mean (this is a very complex question, but we'll try to break it down and make it easier to understand).<n><n>First, this paragraph is about describing compassionate thoughtfull and how it can be defined with other words. This is a very complex sentence and we can't simply write down any old answer. <n><n>As you can see below, we have two distinct parts:<n><n>>*Part A: How might compassioneous be described*<n>>*Part B: As being thoughtful*<n><n>These words are meant to be considered separately and as a unit. This is crucial to remember when giving an answer. This isn't a case of simple word replacement or substitution.<n><n>When asked to describe a verb with another specific word, you can use other types of specific words.<n>  * noun-noun<n>  * adjective- verb<n>  * verb- adjective<n><n>Notice that we are always talking about compassionate, not about thoughful.  <n><n>To evaluate our options, I'll break down each

A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time.

The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:In war, your primary method is combat, but your goal is to do what? Choices:  A: conquer opponent B: fight enemy C: join army D: kill E: terrible<n><n>### Response:		<n>The choices are listed in the following order; from the given choices to the general ones. Therefore, the most likely possible answer is the last four. <n>Step 1: Primary method would be combat.<n>Step 2. Then the goal is to do what. For this one, we can eliminate those which have the same meaning as "the goal", namely, "what you do", like C and D, and the ones which have the opposite meaning to the primary method, like B and E (which is why Step 2 is always the last step).<n>Step 3. Now, since we eliminate the first two from Step 2, what options are left? In other words, in which order should we eliminate the third choice (i.e. the general one) from Step 2?<n>The following pattern can help us to find the answer:<n><n>First, find the last general word (excluding the other questions)<n>Then, find the general word (if there are no other questions)<n>If the next one is general, the answer is general<n>If it is not, it indicates it can be general<n>If it is also general (with multiple general words in any order), the answer is general.<n><n>In this case, what is the last general word? - Army. Then, does it still have any general word after army? The only choice that may be general is terrible. So, the answer is general. Finally, the last choice - terrible, which is the only answer that is general with multiple general words of any order. So, the answer would be terrible.<n>Answer: C, D: terrible<n><n>## See Also<n>[Given-A-Questions](https://github.com/thushan95/Given-A-Question)<n>

Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:When having food at a formal place, what do you usually do? Choices:  A: sit B: being sociable C: talk D: drinking E: medium<n><n>### Response:		<n>We can eliminate the first answer choice, “being sociable” - as to “be sociable” does not specify anything about food. Furthermore, “sitting” is a term only sometimes used to refer to eating food.<n><n>It is unlikely to have a meal where everyone only drinks, so “drinking” is not the correct answer.<n><n>The opposite of medium is larger, and “large” can be used to describe the portion of a meal. Therefore, this does not fit the description of what you do at a formal place, where the food should be “medium”. <n><n>“Talking” does not necessarily imply eating and may not be the correct answer.<n>Therefore, the answer choice is D: Eat.<n><n>### Input 1: You go on a trip to see your old friend. You are trying to find him and his friends at a place you have never been before. <n>Which one do you do first? Choices:  - ask his friend  - walk and look for clues - knock on the door - go to the phone booth - take a map from the counter<n><n>### Response 1: I would ask his friend where my old friend may be at.<n><n>### Response Options<n>When there is too much work to do in a place, the people running the place may post a sign saying so. I have not seen a sign at a bar saying "No one here!" So, I know the answer choice "No one here!" cannot be the answer.<n><n>The answer "Go to the phone booth" cannot be correct because you have to have a phone to go to the phonebooth in the first place. If you do not have a phone, you cannot go to the phone boo, and therefore you would need a map.<n><n>The answer choice "Not there" does not tell whether we are talking about a different place or another location within the same place. I can only conclude that I should search in the first place.<n>Therefore, in our case we should go to the first place.<n><n>### You go on a trip and you see an oversized door that leads to a dark room that is filled with a variety of treasures but that you do not recognize. Choices:  - look for a light switch - look for a hidden code - go in and find treasure - go in and find a trap (

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time.

Choices:  A: water B: doctor C: spread disease D: mouth E: ear<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Steps 1-3:<n><n>Remove options that will always be incorrect based on the context of the question.<n><n>The keyword "get" indicates that something will be received from the food. 1. "Germs" must be received onto food because "germs" cannot enter the food. The answer choice B: Water cannot be eliminated, because eating food will mean that the food could become moist, and so the germs could be spread onto water. Thus, the answer choices B: water and D: mouth cannot be ruled out.<n><n>The keyword 'food' must mean edible food. 2. The other choices are either illness or an element of the body. Thus, the remaining answers are (a) B: Water, (b) C: spread disease, (c) D: Mouth, (d) E: Ear<n><n>#### Step 4:<n><n>Now, the answer choices must provide a complete sentence.<n><n>Option (b): B: water must be eliminated because of the word "your" in the question. You are not going to wash your food with water.<n>Option (e): E: Ear doesn't include the complete thought. Eating food that contains ear can cause an infection. <n><n>#### Step 5:<n><n>The answers C: spread disease and D: mouth do not contradict the answer choice C: spread disease. C:  spread disease tells us that the food can spread disease. C: spread disease can only be spread if it is in a liquid form. It does not say that C: spread disease is liquid.<n><n>#### Other Answer Options<n><n>Therefore, the answer is D: Mouth.<n><n>Answer:<n><n>D: mouth

This is why we are given the option of "offended", however B and C have been eliminated, and we have a choice between a) and d)<n><n>d) is likely to feel "rare" which is why it is included as an option. Rare can also be used in the response in terms of feeling "special" like what is used in option A. <n><n>Therefore, the answer is A and B: special and personal. <n><n>### Input:"Why do people enjoy visiting historical landmarks?" Question marks are not included in choice lists.<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>Choice A states that "people can think fondly back on a particular time" which explains historical landmarks. <n><n>Choice B explains that "historical landmarks remind the visitor of a special period in history", which also explains historical the landmarks. <n>Choice C explains that "historical structures give people confidence in their home and country", which does not explain historical landmarks and therefore this choice is eliminated. <n><n>Choice D mentions why people "can become better acquainted with a local area" which is a way to learn about a place, so this choice is eliminated as well.<n><n>Therefore, if we look at the remaining options, we realize that choice A: people can think fondly back to a particular time, explains historical landmarks, and choice B: historical landmarks reminds the visitor of a special time in history, does as well. Thus, the given answer is A and B, and not C or D. This choice is the only way to answer option D since A and B are answered.<n><n>### Input"Why should people learn how to swim in their youth?"

Choices:  A: desire B: money C: time D: credit E: spending money<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>A. She loved buying products, but she might have other motivations other than desire: love, fear of loss (missing out on new trends), being seen as current, etc.<n><n>### Rationale:<n><n>* If A is correct than she shopped more because she had a desire than any other needs (she might have had money to buy but not to spend). She might just have a weak desire, or she might have many purposes of shopping: money-saving, being seen with the latest trends, being different from other women and so on. We can assume that a person can have multiple reasons for shopping.<n>* C. Shopping can take a lot time. She loved buying more than any other purpose of shopping (other than money/time), but buying does not take much money (other than her credit or savings), so not time/money related.<n>* D. She can enjoy shopping more than she likes saving money (her impulse to save money is not the strongest one).<n>* E shopping is not about the money she likes to do (she can make money and save money, but she was not driven by money).<n>* B. She might try to buy products, but she is not money driven, so love and fear are not in play, fear being the main one.<n><n>### Input : A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush - what does this mean?

Choices:  A: carried by people B: guard house C: fly D: follow ultralight airplane E: group together<n><n>### Response:		 Geese normally go from place to place by flying. Geese have wings and can fly. It is not possible for geese to be carried by people. There would be no places for the geese to be guarding, since a guard is a structure, and not a place. Gees do not have ultralight airplanes but they can be carried on an airplane. It is not possible to follow an ultralight air plane, because they are small and unnoticed, but geese can be seen. Lastly, we will consider the choice, E, group together. Geese may group together but a group would have no definite place. Thus, we will rule this choice out and go back to the choice that we had already eliminated, D, follow ultralight aircraft. We will now consider flying again and notice that flying is the action of moving quickly through air, and we will not consider the answer A, carried by people. We will now consider the answer C, fly, and we do not consider option B, group together, because a group does not have a definite place and we already have the choice fly listed in options. Therefore, the answer would not be choice B. The choices that have already been eliminated would be the answer.<n><n>### Input 2: If a person from Ohio buys a house in New York, what state would the property tax collected from that house be paid to? Choices:  a: state b: ohio c: both d: florida e: new jersey <n><n>### Response2: If a person or business has a property in New York, they would pay the property taxes in the state of New York. The state would not collect the property tax from a house, the state would collect it from the business. In that case, the state would pay the house property taxes in another state, maybe Ohio because both Ohio and New York have an income tax and New York State has some of the highest property taxes in the nation. A person may pay the property tax from their wallet because they own other properties and they only pay for some of their houses if they can't afford any of them. The person pays for the property taxes on the house that they have chosen to live the most, which would be Ohio. The business has more than one house and they probably pay taxes in both Ohio and New York. <n>### Input 3:

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:Joe bought a ficus.  He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>###### Choice A:<n><n>######  Answer:<n><n>###### Family Room<n><n>### Rationales:<n>```sh<n>  A ficus plant is a type of tree.<n>  However, it does not look good in a forest, where trees are found naturally.<n>  Similarly, it does not look well in a hair salon, whose decorating theme may not look good with plant decorations.<n>  Furthermore, a ficus would not be a good decoration for a large movie.<n>  Finally, a ficus would unlikely look good in a flower garden,  since the natural environment of a ficus is that of a tree<n>```<n><n>### Input<n>Choices: <n>1. A: movie theatre 2. B: flower garden 3.C: hair salon 4. D: tropical forest 5. E: family room<n>Rationales:<n>1. The name movie theatre clearly means it is for viewing movies.<n>2. The name movie theatre already contains the word theatre, so we can eliminate D.<n>3. A hair salon decorating scheme may look nice with a ficus tree, but likely would not look beautiful with the decorating theme of a flower garden. <n>4. A flower garden is typically green with bushes.<n>5. A tropical forest would not necessarily have a ficus plant in it, and so the answer is B: flower garden.<n><n>### Input  <n>Question: 1.

Choices:  A: toy store B: home C: school D: toy shop E: shelf<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>**A**<n>Evaluate the conditions in 3rd Sentence: "where your family play a board game"<n>Rationales:<n>1. The 3rd option is the Toy Shop where you buy the game<n>2. If you choose Toy Shop, then your family needs to buy the game from shop.<n>3. We can eliminate the Toys Shop option because family can't play a board game there even if you are provided it because you can not bring the board game home with you.<n>4. Hence 1st, 2nd and 5th options are rejected. <n>4. The only remaining option is where your family play board game i.e A: toy store.<n>5. All things considered, if the conditions in the sentence are met then Toy Store is the answer.<n>

They were really what? Choices:  A: personal B: special C: shiny D: rare E: irregular<n><n>### Response:		<n>The question states that they were Bob’s Pokemon cards, which means that they were Pokemon cards that Bob owned. Bob thought that they were common and worthless because he thought they were Pokemon cards common enough that people in his town would have them too. Therefore, the Pokemon cards he thought to be common were not rare like his neighbors had, but they were instead really rare because they were very valuable.<n><n>Answers:<n><n>Pokemon cards are trading cards owned by players who play the Pokemon video game. These cards have value and can be traded between people. Pokemon cards that are common are so common that many people own them, and their value is very low. One example of a common Pokemon card is Charizard, a card whose worth is less than a dollar on online auctions. Pokemon cards that aren't common and are rarer have higher values. For example, there is a rare Pokemon card named the First Edition Trainer No 1, which has a value of more than $4,000 on online auctions, 100 times more expensive than Charizard. Pokemon cards that players consider rare are usually shiny like the First Edition Trainer because shiny Pokemon cards have higher values. An example of a shiny card is Venusaur's GS 18, which has an estimated value of $800 or more on online auctions. <n><n>### Input : What type of breath makes noise, but doesn't indicate you're sick?

Choices:  A: automobile accidents B: backache C: eye strain D: getting tired E: car crash<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The choice A is not possible because an accident and backache cause pain. Another reason is that there would be no automobile accidents in the future if they do not involve pain.<n><n>The choice B is not possible because backaches do not occur in the future and have been experienced in the past. <n><n>The choice C is not possible because eye strains are experienced by people who read for long time, and do not happen to those who don't spend long hours staring at a computer screen or phone.<n>    <n>The choice D is not possible because accidents with a car do not happen to all of those who are driving a car.<n>    <n>The final choice is option E-a car crash, because car crashes always cause accidents.<n><n>Answer: E: a car crash<n><n>## Other Questions<n>### Below is an instruction that asks for a task. <n>###### Write a response that completes the task.<n><n>Input: The following statement is a sentence fragment, not because it ends with a preposition, but because the subject is not in the sentence. This is a common confusion, where students often think because a fragment is missing an object, so a preposition is misplaced. In reality, many fragments do have subjects. What do we do when our preposition is not in place? We try to put the noun or pronoun earlier in the sentence to make it into a complete sentence.  Choices:  A) change the sentence fragment <n>B) make the sentences longer by adding more detail C) write a sentence with an active voice D) delete incorrect prepositions E) rewrite the fragment <n>Rationales: The sentence begins with "The following statement...." and thus, the subject of the statement is being talked about or compared to another statement, as in "The following statement is a sentence".  <n>Step 1: This is a fragment, because it lacks a grammatical subject.<n>Step 2. This is a common sentence fragment, because it laces the part of speech in brackets. We can rewrite it as "The following statement [is a] sentence fragment."<n>Step 3. It is not a sentence fragment because it does not have a subject, but it laces one that is left out from the previous statement. This subject can be considered as the sentence's topic.<n>Step 4. There are two ways to finish this sentence. 1)

Choices:  A: growing older B: reproducing C: shuddering D: perspiration E: palpitations<n><n>### Response:		<n>I think that is not really possible to determine this without further information. The question contains a lot of ambiguity. A, growing older, can be a sign or the actual cause of dying, but it is often not clear. B, reproducing, could be a sign that you are alive, too. C, shudering, doesn’t really mean that you can’t live. There are people with diseases that cannot shudder at all. D, perspiration, doesn’t really say anything about your life. And the last choice, palpitations, is often a symptom of a sickness that ends in dying.

The app provided a choice for noise and an animal sound. It then provided a choice for whether it was correct or not. The final questions asked for the correct answer, which I then wrote it out below with descriptions. The purpose was to evaluate the correctness of the answers to the earlier questions whereby the app responded. <n><n>The first app provided the question: “What often happens after a lengthy day of travel, specifically by plane?”<n>My response: “A. sickness”<n>The next choice it gave was “B. motion sickness.” <n>My response: “C. relocation.” It stated the explanation: “The traveler is not sick, so sickness is ruled out as an option. Motion sickness is a physical effect rather than a long term condition. Therefore, the answer must not be sickness. Relocation is associated with traveling and not with being ill. Sickness could be said to be associated with jet lag. Although it happens, it doesn’t often occur, so it is probably not a primary symptom of a lengthy day of being on a plane, and also doesn’t have to do with travel, so is easily ruled out. Therefore, being relocated is the choice that most fully meets the criteria outlined in the question.<n>The following options were provided: A: sickness, B: motion sickness, C: relocation, D: jet lag E” fatigue.<n><n>The second App provided the question: “Who has the sharpest teeth in the wildlife world?”<n>My response:”A: predators”<n>The next choice provided was “B: sharks.”<n>My response: “Not predator.

E: corner thief is also excluded because corner thief is a type of activity (meaning to steal from shops) and is not related to the type of traffic in this case (meaning stopping cars).<n>6. D: force open door is the only choice that fits the scenario. There was an accident and the policemen needed to remove the traffic out of the way and stop cars, which can be done only by forcing the traffic (cars) to stop by blocking the route.<n><n>Answer: D: force open door<n><n><n>

A: Try to<n>unlock a device by using the find my phone app. B: Use a USB cable to try to access the phone.<n>C: Try a password reset D: Use a blank password E: Try to restore the phone by using a<n>computer and iTunes<n>Rationales:<n>Step 1: We know that we get stuck in situations. The key is to find answers about what to do in stuck situations.<n>Step 2. Consider each choice and evaluate each of them in the given scenario.<n>Step 3. First of all, i tunes application requires an apple account to use, thus if you don't have one, or the account is deleted for security, you won't be able to use that app.<n>Step 4. We know that a blank password won't work since an android phone needs the owner's password to unlock it.<n>Step 5. Try a password reset will work. When you log out a mobile phone and log in to a new account, if you find that another account is already logged in to that device and it is required to enter the password for that particular account, the phone screen will display a password reset request. In this case, we will try with a password reset and if it works, we will get on to the next step. If the reset is successful, the phone will be unlocked. But that will delete all data that was in the phone.<n>Step 6: Thus, option B is a good choice. We can plug either a USB or lightning wire into the mobile phone and try opening the device using the find my phone application. So, we can also say that option E also is a good choice. Option D is not a good choice since by trying to enter a blank password will delete all the files in the phone.<n>Option C is not a good choice, because by using a USB drive or wire we find that by doing so we can easily open and unlock the phone.<n>Option E is the second best choice since it will open the device in no time and we will be able to use it.<n>Option A shouldn't be the first choice since it will make us unable to login to the application

The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick?

First, define each choice, then choose an appropriate one.<n>2. Step 1: Identify each choice.<n>2.1. A: assisted living: nursing home, which only applies when the patient is sick and can take care of himself. Here, Sally is doing well on her own as no one has a reason to send her to a nursing home.<n>2.2.B: old people's homes: This place receives the old, sick, or disabled, including infants. However, since Sally is not sick and is just a student, this cannot be the answer.<n>2.3. C: high school or College: This is her house.<n>2.4.D: republican party: This is an organization that needs people to apply, not just be part of it. The answer is not even applicable to this situation because Sally is not a member of any kind.<n>2.5. E: organization: This could refer to any organization, but this answer is not relevant, since Sally is obviously a student.<n>3. Step 2: Look for the choices with specific details that are applicable to this scenario.<n>3.1. A high school: This could be applicable to a student's living situation. The student may be living and studying here, but this does not necessarily meet the specific need, especially for Sally, who is a senior.<n>3.2.

A: Sally lives and goes to school so this choice is correct.<n>

When your goal is to find the most likely word in a list, it is easy to misinterpret what ali means. This may come from the way you read this, either "Alice" or "Ally" or some other combination. Regardless of what you hear in your head, this is the first choice. Ali is clearly a common term and will not be the object of the pronoun that will be used in this statement. The sentence, "What would you tell Ali to do?" will result in A: Work Hard, the first choice in the list.<n><n>### Response 2:<n><n>Since Clavicle Yen, Choices, and Ali are all pronounced as ali, you will likely make the first choice. The second word of the list is Clavicle, which is likely due to the word "Clavicular", which refers to the body's clavicle. As a result, the answer will be A: work hard.<n><n>**Reference:** [[https://github.com/GoogleChromeLangResearch/multimodal-qas#usage-instructions](https://github.com./multimodal-questions/usage-instructions)]<n><n>---

Therefore, a person is not likely to be a hero if death is involved.<n>* If  the hero is not someone who saves the lives, we do not know the extent of the hero's battle nor if the battle is considered as a tremendous one. <n>Consider "putting their families and friends in danger":<n>* If the hero is not someone saving the lives of people, they may not have put friends and family in danger.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is  A: someone who saves people's lives and then dies mysteriously.<n><n>**Answer:** A: someone who saves lives and then dies mysteriousely. <n>

The scientists gave the following examples of the punishment given:  If a young chimp challenged the dominant male by rushing at him, then he would either push the chimp out of the way or use his long arms to prevent the challenge. If a young chimp did something a little less aggressive, if he, for example, just wagged his lips at the dominant male, then the dominant male would slap him lightly with his hands or with his tail.<n><n><n>### Rationales:<n><n>### Choice A<n><n>We can determine that the punishment given in the above scenario is A - if the young chimp challenges the dominant male by running to him he will either push him away or use his long arms. So we can eliminate options B, E, and F.<n><n>### Choices B and C<n><n>According to the scenario, C - "slapping him lightly with his hand" is not correct, since the dominance is given by the dominant male. Slapping a young chimp with his tail, however, is not a dominance signal, but a punishment given by the dominant male for challenges or acts of disrespect. We can eliminate D - slapping a young chimp's tail as part of the punishment.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>* The most appropriate choice is C: slapping a young chimb with his tail<n><n>### Input 2:<n>Giraffes eat leaves, and lion's eat meat, and zebras eat grass.

Choices:  A: dissipate B: flown C: disintegrate D: fall apart E: penultimate<n><n>### Response:		What has happened to the money after a person has used the last of his or her money?  It has dissipated.<n><n>* There is a rule to test the answer. The rule says: If you have spent all of your money, that is called having dissipated it.<n>* If all the money is gone, there isn’t any money left. But if you’re still getting money, you haven’t spent it all. So, there must be money left. This money that is left is called the penultimate.<n><n>* When you’re choosing your answer, ask yourself which word in the question means the same as the word for “last” in the choices. For example, if you’re asked what happens to money after you’ve used the last of it, what is the word that means “after you’ve used the LAST of it”?<n><n>### Demo response:<n>What has happened to a girl's money after she has used all of it on a birthday present for her mother? Choices: 1. dissipate 2. flown 3. disintegrate 4. fall apart 5. penultimate<n><n>Answer 1: This girl hasn't spent all of her money yet. If she had, that would mean she had spent all of it and it had dissipated. So, this answer, dissipate, is incorrect.<n><n>Answer 2: The money has not flown anywhere. If the money had flown anywhere, the girl would not have any money left to help her buy her mother a gift. So the answer, flown, is incorrect.<n>        <n>Answer 3: The money has not disintegrated. The girl could use these funds to help her buy her mom a nice gift. So, if the money had disintegrated, that would mean it had changed into other forms that may be useful when buying her mom a birthday present. <n>      <n>Answer 4: The money hasn't fallen apart. If it had fallen apart, there would be no way that the girl could use money to buy her mom a nice birthday present. So, the answer, fall apart, is incorrect.<n>          <n>Answer 5: The money has not been spent completely yet.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where do humans go in cities to be in nature? Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:Where can you find a place to eat and places to buy items of many different kinds? Choices:  A: city B: downtown C: own house D: bar E: shopping center<n><n>### Response:		A:city<n><n>### Explanation:From the options stated in the question “Where can you find a great place to eat and place to buy items of many kinds?” (implicitly a place that has both food and goods), and based on the other given options we can infer that:<n><n>* city: a city is a city in a city, not in a town, that can have a great place to eat, places to shop many different kinds of items, and is the default assumption to be a general place<n>* downtown: downtown may only have one great place or places to buy, many different kinds of items. It's more likely to be where people rent apartments(where their house is not big enough) or houses in town<n>* own house: there's a possibility to find a great place to shop, eating and buy items in your own house but it would need a specific room or place to be done. A house is implied to be in a town, not a city.<n>* bar: there's a good chance to buy any items or eat in any type of bar, but it's unlikely to have a great place. A bar is not a default place to stay when a person goes out.<n>* shopping mall: shopping mall doesn't have many choices when trying to buy any items.<n><n>The only options to fit all aspects of the statement is therefore the answer city.<n><n>### Answer: B: City<n>

Choices:  A: cinema B: opera C: party D: stage E: dance<n><n>### Response:		<n>**C: Party** <n><n><n>Rationales: C: The performer is a person that is part of the show or a member of the band.  The word opera describes a kind of show or the place you see a show, a stage. The performer on the stage of an opera may not be a close friend. <n>An opera singer is also not a typical performer one would see at a party unless they are also the host.<n><n>Dance: It doesn't involve a performer. It's a show for you and other persons, with your close friends, where you all learn the dance. And you do it with your close friends.<n><n>**A: Cinema:** A cinema does not describe a gathering of friends. You sit in a cinema in an individual seat, and you enjoy the performance, so you would see a performer somewhere on it. But the performers are the film actors on the screen. You don't know the performers.<n><n>**E: Dance:** Dance is a show you do with your close friends. You may be a performer, but you aren't necessarily. You are involved in the production, but you are a party to the dance more than the performer in a drama.<n><n>**B: Opera:** Opera is a kind of show, but you do not have to be close friends to go to an opera.  An opera describes a place you see a show. The word "party" does not describe a gather of you or your close friends, who may or may not include a performer.<n>So, the answer is C, "party."<n><n>### Input<n><n><n><n>Step 1: Identify the main purpose of the question.<n>Step 2 & Step 3: Process the two remaining choices.<n><n><n>### What is the highest form of flattery?

The question directly talks about all the people the speaker and the friend are missing. So, there is no way that every person being missing (including their friend) is a man.<n>B. The question does not state or mention what type of people the speaker is missing. <n>C. There are only two possibilities - 1) the missing person is another man; 2) the missing person is a woman. The speaker might be looking for a man, but there is no indication in the question that the missing person is a man.<n>D. This means that there are exactly three people between you and your friend, two of whom are men and one woman. <n>E.

Choices:  A: houses B: bedroom C: istanbul D: open tress E: gym<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>As I walked out of the room, all I could think was that I was leaving a nightmare. It always happened. After working so hard to get something right, I always seemed to take two steps back. There would be another room to fill and another room to decorate. I had no choice. The house had to be finished today, and that meant me moving into my third room in as many days. When I entered the house, I found there was very little in the rooms, except the furniture that had been left behind by the previous tenants. My old friend, Teddy, had told me to get the bedroom ready before getting anything else. Teddy’s advice was always good. However, every time I stepped into the room, I found it to be cold and damp. The night before, I had thought about making a fire, but after a long day, I had felt too tired. I had been tempted to stay up a little later just to make something to help me through the night. Instead, I spent some time trying to work on one of my art assignments. But I couldn’t stay up because I had a class early in the morning. The bedroom, with its cold hard tile floor, felt even worse to me in the morning than in the evening. I didn’t like the idea of getting up and stepping onto that floor. It wasn’t bad enough that I would have to step on the cold hard tile every morning and every evening. In order to warm it up a bit, I decided to get an electric heater and move it to the bedroom. It would give me some warmth for a while, but also, hopefully, help me fall asleep. By the time the sun came up that day, I was eager to get back to painting. I picked up my paintbrush and went in to my room. As I sat on the hard tile and painted away, my mind began racing. My heart pounded as I stared at the blank canvas. When someone stepped into their house, they immediately felt its welcoming warmth as they stepped across those very same tiles. It was so easy and so natural for someone to fall asleep and wake up fresh every morning in order to face the long days ahead.<n><n>As I turned over in bed, I began to notice strange sounds coming from the kitchen. I could hear muffled conversations and laughter among the appliances.

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick?

Choices:  A: accomplish B: make progress C: stop arguing D: do business E: concert<n><n>### Response:		A: accomplish<n><n>### Feedback: The reason why we are able to answer the question is because we are familiar with the background context from previous questions. "What kind of breathing makes sound but does not produce noise when you are sick?" The answer is:sigh. This also implies that 1. when you talk about breathing and making noise in a sentence, it does not necessarily mean that it produces the same effect. 2.sigh often results in making sound but it does not indicate that you're sick because it indicates relaxation with a happy feeling.<n>

Choices:  A: supermarket B: pig C: cow D: refrigerator E: store<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>1.  The only valid choice is B: pig. It is the only type of animal that produces milk according to the definition of the question.<n>2.  The other choices are not relevant to the question since they are either places that sell and store milk or they are other animals that don’t produce milk.<n>3.  Additionally, the words “supermarket”, “refrigerator”, and “store” are not a synonyms for B, “pig” and thus cannot be the answer.<n>4.

And thus, since the last player fouled does not seem to be the one who was fouled, a yellow card is not the answer.<n><n>Step 4: To determine what the fouled player receives after foul play, you must look for signs or clues.<n><n>Step 5:  A red card means that a person is sent off the field and cannot return for the rest of the game. The only other choice that could work is the time-out; this also means that the fouled player is out for the rest of the match, but it doesn’t require them to leave the field, which we can eliminate A-D.<n>Step 6: This leaves the only remaining part of the puzzle, the penalty kick, which is awarded to the fouled player.<n>Step 7: Because of this, the correct response is C: penalty kick.<n><n>### InputS<n>What are all the animals that are also insects?<n><n>#### Response<n><n><n>An animal is a multi-faceted biological entity.

Bears are used as mascots on many American college and professional sports teams.<n><n>### Answer: The first thing to do is determine the purpose of the question. In this case, you are asked to find a synonyms for two words.<n><n>### First, we look at the second choice, “foolish”. It means acting rashly or impulsively without considering the consequences. It is usually used as an insult to describe someone acting rashly or recklessly. Some options can be eliminated. For example, option D, “intelligent”, is definitely not the correct one. Someone who is “intelligent” is usually neither “foolish” nor “thoughtful” to any degree.<n><n>### Options B: Careful and A: Thoughtful are somewhat reasonable choices, but neither is correct. Careful does not mean “opposite of foolish”, as suggested by the question. Being “thoughtful” means being careful, deliberate, or having considered something. There’s no reason we should look at “careful” and “thoughtful” as opposites, any more than “wet” and “dry”.<n><n>### Option C: “Careful” is very similar to “careful”. We could eliminate “careful” and look for another option with “careful” in the words, like “cautious”, “calculated” or “calculators”.  All the mentioned options are definitely not what we expected from the question.<n><n>## Analysis<n><n>How does the student think through each step in the instruction?<n><n>How did your co-instructor demonstrate each concept?<n><n>What other feedback can the students give about their experience being co-instructed by a peer?<n>

Choices: A: feel sorry B feel trustful C: cross street D ride a bike E lend money<n>Rationale:<n>1. Choice A feels sorry has 2 different meanings, and the one we need to use is the one that makes sense in the context of the question.<n>2. If a person does something hurtful to another person, they _might_ feel sorry, since it goes along with the question, therefore a might fits in the blank.<n>3. Choice B feel trustful does not make any sense in this context.<n>4. Choices C cross street D ride a bicycle E lend money are similar in the way that the phrase "might do" can describe this. But we should eliminate those since the phrase "do(s) something" is already there. Hence, the correct answer is A: feel sorry.<n>Answer: A<n><n>### Input:"Avoid taking pictures at the top of the mountain as you may risk your life."<n>What would be a good way to capture photos?

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:Where could you put some olives to prevent them from getting nearby food wet?

Choices: 1. syllable 2. prefix 3. suffix 4. accent 5. intonation<n>Rationales: The two obvious choices, suffix and prefix, occur in English words, but the teacher is most likely to refer to them in relation to vocabulary and writing, not speaking. <n>For example, one can add a prefix such as "un-" to a word in a sentence, but not in speech. As for accent and intonation, they are not words. They are used in speech, such as stress and intonation patterns but are not referred to in the context of vocabulary and spelling. Only syllable and accent are used in the same way and so are the best choices.<n>Answer: 1. sy<n><n>### Input<n>Input: what would a basketball player do if the ball got stuck in the net? Choices: 	1. take a free throw 2. take a shot 3. take a point 4. take a penalty kick 5. take a penalty shootout<n>Rationales: A player has three choices if the ball gets stuck in a basketball net: take a free throw, take a shot, or take a penalty shootout. A free throw and a shot are ways to score points, while a penalty kick refers to awarding a point to the opposing team. These ideas should help in the elimination process. First, all three of these choices are possible things a player can do when the ball gets stuck, so option one can be eliminated. Second, out of the three remaining options, choosing 2 is a possibility since a point could be scored, but the phrase, “take a shot”, does not include any other ideas. This option can  be eliminated. <n>The final options are 3 (take a point) and 5 (take a penalty shootout). <n>Option 3, take a point, refers to a basketball player scoring a point when the ball is put in the net. It is the correct answer, as the options that could be selected from were all possible things that a player can do when a ball gets stuck in the net.   <n><n>### Instructions:  <n>Answer the following multiple choice

A: grilling B: barbecue C: baking D: boiling E: roasting<n><n>### Rationales 1. To clarify and answer the question, we must first deﬁne what "grilling" is and how people normally do it: Cooking on a grill. 2. To clarify and answer this question, we must first look into and understand what "grilling" means and usually consists of. We must also use reasoning to exclude those options that do not make sense to the situation. If we use the context of this situation, barbecue is not what the questioner is asking about because barbecuing is done at a barbeque. So those options that consist of 'barbecue' must be excluded. 3. Using inductive reasoning, options A & B both have the word 'grill' in them. However, those options also tend to be used for cooking outside. Since this question mentions it is in a kitchen, the options not involving barbeques are automatically excluded from the answer. 4. When it comes to cooking food in a kitchen, one does not have to watch every single progress. Thus, option D must necessarily be excluded. 5. In a situation involving cooking food while not watching it, barbecuing the food would be very time consuming and very difficult. Therefore, the options involving barbecues must also be excluded. 6. When it comes to something like barbecue, which normally consist of multiple people cooking food together, baking food would be the slowest option to cook the food. Thus, option E, as well as D must also be excluded from contention. 7. Therefore, the question is asking us to choose between baking and roasting. Thus, the answer must be C: baking.<n><n>Answer: C: baking<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the two multiple choice questions based on this passage<n><n>### Demostration:<n><n>### Instructor: Please take out a piece of paper and begin reading<n><n>Read:<n><n>Little boys and Littie girls make mud pies in their yards,<n>And sometimes the big mud pies aren’t any fun.

Choices:  A: music store B: dance hall C: orchestra D: symphony E: tennessee<n><n>### Response:		The options for an answer are choices A, B, and D. From the choices given in the question, all of the locations where a fiddle can play are places where music (dance and fiddle) is being played. Furthermore, a fiddle playing in a music store is not usually a problem, since many musical instruments can be played by employees. <n><n>### Response 2:<n><n>### Demostration<n>Input: An arch has five smaller arches, called supports, holding it up. Each support is equally spaced along the curve of the arch. Which is the middle support of the arch? Choices: 1. A: last support 2. B: first support 3. C: third from left support 4. D: middle (third from right) support<n><n>Rationales:<n>1. The first support only supports the arch, and cannot be the support that "holds it up. Furthermore, if this support is "last" support, then supports are not distributed equally (i.e. last support is not "also called the last support").<n><n>2. A support is "middle support" if it is the support in the middle. (C) The support on the third side from the right is the middle support. <n><n>3. If the choice "middle support" is not the third-from-right one, then there are "middle supports". (I.e., C and D are not correct.)<n><n>4. Since the last and first supports are not "middle supports", they are neither the last, nor the first "support" which means both alternatives (A) first support and (B) last support are incorrect.<n><n>5. Since C and D are eliminated, that leaves only A and B to choose from. <n><n>6. A and B cannot be the answer since the middle support cannot be located to the right or left of the arch itself.  <n>Answer: C: Third-from-left support.<n><n>### Input : Which is not an answer to "In which season does it rain most often in Chicago"?

The first step to take in this problem is to determine the question's scope. <n><n>Rationales: First, it is important to break down the given questions and make appropriate connections. From the given questions, we see that drugs are not only any substance, but they also "do" things, such as damage your brain or cause accidents.<n><n><n>### Based on this information, the answer to the question lies among the choices. <n><n><n>### Step 1<n><n>### Step two: ELIMINATE THE INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSES.

Choices:  A: circus B: carnival C: surprise D: spoons E: party<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. We can rule out choices A, B, and C. We know that "want to run away", in this case, refers to "want to become a [clown/circus performer]", and not "want to run far away from home" which would be the more common meaning of the phrase. <n>2. The phrase here refers to clowns and the rest of the circus entertainers, as the man wants to join them. <n>3. "Surprise" has the connotation of "something that is unexpected" or "something that you are not ready for", which does not match the context of the question.<n>4. The choices D and E all involve some type of party, which does not follow from the question. The man ran away from home but not to a party. <n>5. Therefore, we can see by process of elimination that the answer is, "college".<n><n>Input: What part of a plane does an air hostess sit on?

Choices:  Yes No<n>Rationales: The answer is not the same as the question because there is an assumption that the sponge is meant to be water-tight. <n>Thus, the answer is no. The statement 'A sponge is water-tight' might mean that the sponge will not absorb water. However, the question 'Is a sponge water tight?' implies that the sponge should contain all the water and not absorb any. The rationale for this approach is that if the person has a sponge that is water-tight, and asks 'is this sponge water tight?', the answer of 'No' would make sense as the sponge would already be perfectly water-tight.<n><n>### Reference:<n><n>https://github.com/taylorjwu/Water-tight-Sponges/blob/master/Readme.md<n><n>https://githubusercontent.com/taylorwu2020/Water-ticket-Sponges/master/Readme/readme.md

Choices:  A: fishing camp B: hardware store C: engine D: your spine E: sporting goods store<n><n>### Response:		<n>We can eliminate choice A:<n><n><n>    The question refers to damage done to a *rod*, and in most cultures, fishing camps do not use fishing rods. It is more likely for a person to throw a rod made from wood or a metal stick when they are frustrated, or throwing a fishing rod used by children. However, there are still instances where both a hardware store and the engine can also be thrown.<n><n>    We can eliminate choice E: We can eliminate choice E since sporting goods stores do not sell fishing rods. <n><n>    We can also rule out choice C: since engines usually do not get thrown.<n>    Therefore, choices left are B Hardware Store and D Your Spine. <n><n>    However, it is most likely that choice B is correct, because of the following reasons:<n>        1. B is more specific than the others, describing a store that sells materials for building/construction. <n>        2. D Damage to one's spine sounds serious enough that it is not likely someone would choose B. <n>        2) D damage your spine is unlikely since a person would not likely throw one of the above items at their spine which is located in one's back, not in their face or chest directly. In some cases, damaging their spine may be as serious as a broken leg if it does not heal quickly, so it is unlikely to occur. <n>        - Hardware vs Engine:<n>        3. Most people who would throw a rod at someone or something would likely choose to throw a rod made of wood or metal, which is more likely to cause damage to the hardware than damaging the engine.<n>        4) An engine could harm a person, but the damage would be due to fire/flames or other issues more than someone getting hurt by the engine itself.<n><n>        Since engine damage is not likely, therefore we are left with:<n><n>        - B & E: The items available in B and E do not meet all of the qualifications of choice - so choice E, Sports Goods Store, may be correct.<n>       <n>        - B (More information):<n>        5) Additionally, we can rule out B because sports goods stores do not sell rods in the United States, and in the United States, people are more likely to throw a stick used in fishing (usually with a fish

It does not specify how the desired mark was measured, and so could refer to a grade. However, as one of the other answers states, it could also refer to whether you received an appropriate pay grade. However, I don't think the question is ambiguous as to its referent.

The second rule helps to enforce the first, but a game without such rules would not be one in which people could actually play; driving safely is an essential and foundational rule of the concept of "driving." In the case of a basketball game, the most essential rule is arguably the rules of the game, which state where offensive and defensive players may be on the court, which players may participate, and what may be done with each specific item.  There are so many other rules in place in the game that people still choose to respectfully call fouls when a violation occurs.<n><br>

Otherwise, if all food were consumed, you'll feel "contentment". <n><n>#### Rationales<n><n>Even though the question is asking for a condition, as it's quite obvious that a person who is sick cannot feel pleasure and happiness, those options can be eliminated right away.<n><n>Therefore, if you eat until your stomach is full, your body will feel "contentment" which is not a condition that is related to answering the question. <n><n>So, by elimination, answer has to be "mess"<n><n>Answer: A: Mess<n>

Choices:  A: condition heart B: expend energy C: laugh D: stretch E: weigh<n><n>### Response:		<n>The input states that many addicts turn to exercising to treat their addictions. The word "addict" does not necessarily indicate that they have the disease of addiction, but it usually does. The input states that exercise is a good way for addicts to treat a form of addiction, and there are various other types of addiction. From this it can be determined that it is the addiction to alcohol that the addicts are dealing with, and exercise is a natural method of curing the physical pain of alcoholism.

The question was asking what game is the player in, given that the answer will only be one of the options. The multiple choice question was the best choice to use because there were only going to be a few options to choose from, allowing it to be accurate. The best choice was to keep everything relevant. If this question was posed to children, there were multiple other choices besides football and hockey. If the question instead were to ask the player what the kind of box was that they were put in, this question would not be relevant. <n><n>The answer was that it was an hockey game according to the choices provided. These are accurate because those are examples of games in which a hockey player could be sent to the penalty bench. It also states that it does not

Choices:  A: fish market B: pet shop C: great outdoors D: river E: little mermaid<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The blowfish, which is commonly known as a puffer fish, belongs to a family of saltwater fish called tetraodontidae. This particular blowfish lives in its natural habitat: the ocean. It lives in the greater tropic ocean region and tends to be located in relatively warm waters with a salinity value of 1.0%. <n><n>In contrast, pufferfish sold as food are typically farmed in aquatic facilities and are bred for commercial purposes, where they are kept in tanks or in the water and thus do not live free. <n><n>In terms of the blowfish’s lifestyle, he does not currently live in the pet shop, because he never lived in one. <n><n>As a predator, the blowfish eats a wide variety of foods found underwater, and he spends most of his time living freely in the greater tropic oceans. Therefore, the answer choice that best fits the blowfish’s natural habitat and lifestyle is choice E: Great Outdoors.<n><n>### Assignment:Please answer all four questions. <n><n>1.

While it is possible that the patient had indigestion after eating a dinner of raw chicken, that was not what the passage asked. The passage asked specifically about what the poor man felt after eating the chicken, not what he would feel.<n><n>#### Response: <n>*I agree that the response incorrectly stated "A: indigestive." This is a typographical error. The entire question and statement ask what "WAS" felt by the man, not "was felt by the man." This would change the response answer to "C: illness" as the word "sickness" is used in the question. "Sickness" and " illness", although not identical terms, should be considered equal to each other for the purpose of this question.<n>*The response should be scored as "E: throwing up" because this option corresponds to the first option, what WAS felt, not what was felt after eating uncooked chicken.<n>*The author's response does not correspond to the passage at all and should not have received 4 points, nor an A.<n><n>#### Input: The patient had an attack of diarrhea, but only after eating the raw chicken.<n><n>### Answer: B: Die<n><n>### Explanation:<n>Input: What was felt by the poor chicken eater?

Choices:  A: bookstore B: library C: doctor D: home E: table<n><n>### Response:		<n>A magazines are kept either in libraries or in homes, we know that, as the question says,'most people' keep it, hence home is a more probable option than the library as it is not a place that has been visited or kept in by most people.<n><n>### Rationales: 1, Libraries are places where people tend to keep magazines.<n>2. Magazines are not kept commonly in the doctor's office nor in a table as they are not places where people normally hang out nor keep magazines. They often do not have magazines lying about at home unless they purchase magazines regularly, and it is also implied that bookstores do not sell or keep magazines. Therefore, we can eliminate A, D and E for the first two steps of the process. <n>3. Since most people do not often hang out in bookstores, we can eliminate C as the answer in the second step <n>4. Home and library are the only two place not eliminated at the final step, but homes is more likely to be chosen as a location that magazines will be displayed or lying around than the library as a majority of people do not hang out in libraries as much, nor is that a place that magazines will likely be hung.<n>5. Home is the more likely answer to the question. Answer: A: home<n><n>### Input:-23 * -3 = Question: What is 0?<n><n>### Response<n><n>23 * -3 is multiplied by -3, so that is 69<n><n>### Rationale: The multiplication is negated as a single number, so it will become a negative number. <n><n>### Answer:-23 * -(-3) = -0<n>

Since she was clearly getting worked up about the topic, the reason must be either A. Accidents that are serious like this. B. Accident in general. Since B happens to everyone, she is referring to all of them not just her friends.

He could see clouds when he looked out his window.  Where might he live? Choices:  A: in books B: radio station C: city D: tower E: medieval castle<n><n>### Response:		<n>#### Demonstration<n>Input: Where might James live?<n>Challenges:<n><n>1. Choice A: books - In books, the word "lived" is always used when describing a character, not a real person.<n>2. Choice B: radio station - a radio station is a business which involves audio transmitting and broadcasting, not housing.<n>3. Choice C: city - In the context, CITY can only mean the actual area/place called "city", which consists of houses along with other common buildings, such as shops, offices, churches, etc. Therefore, it cannot be the answer since it is not a tower.<n>4. Choices D: tower - The question asks 'where might he live'.  Therefore, the answer must involve living in a tower and not anywhere else.<n>5. Choices E: medieval castle - a medieval castle would have been built hundreds of years ago, and would therefore NOT be the answer. <n><n>Therefore, the only valid choice seems to be option D, but there is doubt about the correctness of this option.  Could James have lived in a tower a long time ago but would be in different circumstances now?  What if he used to live in a tower but moved to a different one? Could a tower be in a different city?<n><n>Final answer:<n>In summary, D, T, C, B, A are not reasonable answers because they are general terms.<n>However, the option “tower” is the only specific answer that remains.  Thus, this is indeed to the correct answer.  There are no other ways of saying "tall tower" besides using this simple word sequence "tall tower".<n>Answer: D: tower<n><n>### Input<n>What do you call it when you throw an apple at a tree?

A motel is a place where people stay the night, but shampoo is usually left at home in most instances, therefore,'motel' can be disregarded. <n>2. At a hair salon you wouldn't use this much shampoo all at once. If you use a hair salon, you typically don't bring your own shampoo.<n>3. Supermarkets sell shampoo but they don't usually sell as much shampoo at once, and a delivery driver would not use shampoo while working.  <n>4. The shampoo bottles are designed for only one or two uses at a time, with the potential for a 'use' to be only for one individual. <n>5.

This ad is not necessarily negative but it seems like more information is required to get a full understanding of what the ad is actually about. <n>3.

Choices:  A: found B: destroy C: construct D: fix E: produce<n><n>### Response:		What should James do?<n><n>### Rationales: <n>1. There are two conflicting motives.<n>2. This is similar to saying, "I have a hard choice: if I make a choice, I would either ruin or advance a relationship".<n>3. If advancing a relationship means ruining the current one, then the choice is to do nothing. <n>4. Elimination process: First, look for the words which are more closely related to the first choice (if any). Then, look for words which are more contradictory to the first choice ( if any).<n>5. If the second choice involves ruining something, it is unacceptable. This means we can eliminate choices B, D, and E (all choices that involve ruining). The same goes for choice C if it involves constructing something but could instead cause harm on something.<n>6. However, no choice that involves advancement has that much conflict, so the final answer is A: find<n>Answer: A: find<n><n>### Input:"Jane's mom was taking care of her sick friend.

The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time.

Choices:  A: eat ice cream B: have sex C: sit down D: make mistakes E: hear sounds<n><n>### Response:		What do humans want when they want to reproduce is stated in the phrase "they want to reproduce."

Choices: A: I hate my breath B: my breath tells me something is wrong C: I like my breath D: nothing is wrong E: There is something wrong with my breath<n><n>### Response : If I like my breath, but then say it smells, then it does't actually smell good.  However, if I hate my breath and then say it smells bad, then my breath actually does smell.  Therefore, my breath tells me that there is something wrong with my speech.     <n><n>### Input  : There are two types of cats.  Each kind has their own breed.  Breeds can breed.

Each breed of cat can and did breed with another cat breed.  If you look at what it's saying, the word to pay attention to is "with".  "With" is a preposition.  When using prepositions, one must also be aware there is a word that the preposition "breeds" with which is known as it's object.  For instance, the preposition "with" breeds an object because the sentence states "If two breeds each breed... then..."  It is with this object that the sentence is describing.     <n><n>## Instruction : The next five sentences contain parts that were left out. For each, choose the number or letter that best completes the sentence.

Choices: 1 A: calm and anxious 2 B: fear and peace <n>3 C: fear and anxious 4 D: calm and calm 5 E: relaxed and relaxed<n>Rationales: Here, the option(s) 2 & 4 can be eliminated because "fear and peace" and "calm and calm" don't seem to make much sense.<n>Next, if we eliminate those choice, the next few choices that can be eliminated are C and D. In C, it says "fear and anxious" and it doesn't make sense because fear and relaxed are not the same. Also, in D, it says "relief and anxiety" and "calm relief" doesn't make any sense, so we can eliminate that option too.<n>Now that we have eliminated five options, only A and E is left to look at the answer. We can see that A implies that "anxiety can be a way to calm yourself" and E implies that "a way to feel calm is to feel anxious." So finally, we can conclude that the answer is B - "fear and peace."<n><n>Answer: B: fear and peace<n><n>Input: What will the word "momentum" describe when it is applied to any object or item in space?

It says momentum describes the quantity of kinetic <n>energy. Momentum is defined as the product of a mass and a velocity. The velocity can be expressed as the product of the mass times the acceleration, so we know momentum is equal to mass multiplied by the acceleration. <n>Now it is not specified when the momentum is the quantity of kinetic of potential or the total momentum. <n>So in the given context, the momentum should be the quantity of kinetic in space because the speed is related to space.<n><n>Answer: B : The quantity of KE<n><n>Input:

Neither is a tugboat. <n>If we check the wording, if the helm was on a paddleboat, then moving the mast would be equivalent to moving the paddle, which we know is impossible. <n>If the helm were on a tugboat, the answer cannot be "sailing vessel" because we cannot move masts on tugboats. Therefore, the answer to this question is A: sailing ship.<n><n>Answer: A: sailing ship<n><n>### Input-<n><n>- We live on what?<n>### Step-1<n>#### Step-1.1<n>Explanation:The question “what do we live on” means the type of food, the thing from which we derive.<n>#### Step-1.2<n>The definition for the word “live” is as an idiom means to survive; the meaning behind this idiom does not relate to human beings only.<n><n>- We live/survive on what?<n><n>#### Step-1 3<n>The question also states “we live on it” and when we analyze the question, it can refer to animals, insects, living beings, and humans.

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Choices:  A: sigh B: clavicular C: yawn D: cough E: live<n>Rationales: Step 1: First, identify the type of breathing that produces sound.<n>Step 2: From the given choices, sigh, yawn and cough are types of breathing which produce noise.<n>Step 3: Evaluate the conditions in the question - the type of breathing should not indicate that you are sick.<n>Step 4: A cough typically occurs when you're sick, so it can't be the answer.<n>Step 5: Yawning doesn't necessarily indicate sickness, but it also doesn't always produce a noise. <n>Step 6: A sigh, however, always generates a noticeable noise but does not indicate sickness. <n>Step 7: Therefore, the answer is A: sigh.<n>Answer: A: sigh<n><n>### Input:John hated mosquitoes.  It wasn't the bloodsucking that he disliked, it was that the insects made what? Choices:  A: fly B: buzz C: move D: honey E: help flowers pollenate<n><n>### Response:		C<n>### Rationales: The question asks for what the insect does. There are four steps: 1. Identify the key component in the statement to be substituted. We can do this by understanding the function of the statement, which is to explain why the person disliked mosquitoes. The important element in this is that the insects make what. 2. From the list given, we can rule out A, B, and D, which can't make something. 3. From C, we can see "make" indicates that the insect moves around and creates a sound, not that it produces honey or pollenates flowers. Also, mosquitoes don't produce honey or help flowers pollenate, so we eliminate E. 4. From those that fit, we can see they make a sound, which indicates that choice C is correct. <n><n>### Input:"I awoke in an alley, with no clothes and with a dead dog in my right hand."

Let us see your true potential. Now, go back home and read your classwork for next week."  The answer is (X) 1, 2 and 3.<n><n>### Rational: We can eliminate choices (Y), (Z), (A), (B), and (D) because (X), (Y), (Z) are letters and not words, and none of them are words that could be used to describe anyone.<n><n>### A group of friends gathered together in one of their houses.

Choices: A: new york, B: big city, C: town, D: idaho, E: shopping malls.<n><n>Rationales: New York is a big city and thus is excluded from the choice.<n>Similarly, Big city is a broad generic term which refers to either a large city or a small town, and so it too is excluded. <n><n>Therefore, we must compare C, Town, and D, Idaho, and the rationales for doing this are:<n>1. Idaho is a common name for a town and is a suitable answer for the problem. <n>2. Town is also a common name for a place, but it may be referred to as a part of a city such as New York being referred to as a Town.  Hence, town is only suitable as an answer if it refers to the whole city, and Idaho does not refer to a part of the city. <n><n>Given the rationales it makes sense to eliminate town and Idaho is the clear choice. <n>Answer: D: idaho.<n>

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking where in a city do humans go if they want to experience nature.<n>2. The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box. What game are they playing? Choices:  A: sporting event B: time race C: part two boxers D: football E: hockey game<n>Rationales: 1. It is well known that punching is not allowed in most sports, and a foul is called when it happens.<n>2. A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time.

Choices:  A: factory B: school C: grocery store D: band E: aircraft<n><n>### Response:		I would expect to find factory in the input. This is because I understand that the operation has to be in the same place where operations occur. I can eliminate school and grocery store because they are not the place where operations occur.  Band, while does occur in certain specific places, is not the place where operations are conducted. The last choice is aircraft, which is a form of transport, but not where the manufacturing operations are being conducted. Therefore, the answer must be factory.<n>Answer: Factory<n><n>### Input Where in the human body are most fats found?<n><n>### Response where in the human body are fat.

However, the question doesn't clarify where the task is meant to be delegated.  So we have to identify which of the choices is most plausible according to the question. C "another person" refers to a human other than the question or an unknown party. If a situation is likely, this is the correct answer.<n>D The choice D" the floor" does not make sense as it appears to refer to a building without any human-related objects.<n>A. "a computer" The choice A: a computer also makes little sense, as delegation requires the person delegating and the delegating person to communicate. In most situations, a delegate does not have direct control over a computer device. <n>B. "a printer" "a printer" fits better into the context of the question because the question does not specify that the task should be delegated among humans only. This also goes to the main idea of the question 'getting the task done fastest.<n>The final answer is A - C.<n>Answer: A - C.<n><n>### Input":If the player makes a shot in baseball, they lose points.

Choices:  A: wall B: office C: space shuttle D: front door E: tent<n><n>### Response:		The question states that there are lots of windows present in that room, or section of that room.<n>Since the windows on the wall, or in the corner area of the room, are often small or inconspicuous, they may not be counted. Therefore, a room that contains lots of windows must have them in the tent, or the front door, both of which have more windows than typical corner areas. Although the option D, front door, may seem like an easy choice and the most reasonable, it may not be the best because front doors have locks, may have glass that could be shattered, and do not typically have curtains.<n>The other sections, C, Space Shuttle, and B, Office, have too few windows that may not be as effective in lighting the room from all angles as a room with lots of windows. The remaining section, E, Tent, contains the most windows that may be effective in lighting the space for more effective use.<n>Therefore, the answer is E, tent, because it has more windows and is therefore the most effective solution.<n>

The 10th Mountain Division was activated in 1943. The 10,000-15,000 soldiers in Italy formed a combat ski unit that played a key role in the Allied victory. Most of those involved had never skied before. The soldiers would ski across Italy’s Apennine Mountain Ridges and attack German positions in the rugged Dolomite Mountains."<n><n>### Input   : A: A: A: A B: B: <n><n>### Response    : A B<n>### Rationale : There are 3 answers so if we look at the first question “A: A: A: …” we must have 3 correct answers.

Eliminating these two options leaves D and E.  <n><n>D Car can't really mean where to purchase listening vinyl because you never drive a car to listen to listening vinyl, only through it to drive. In addition, you don't buy it from a car, which is also redundant and should be eliminated.<n><n>E Wallpaper seems similar to Record Album Store. It is most likely not the name of a store selliing listening vinyl, but is instead the same as the term, record album, and is therefore redundant and should be eliminatted<n><n>In conclusion, the best and only choice is C Record Store.<n><n>Answer: C Record Store<n><n># 🧐 Why did you choose these questions as examples of multiple choice problems with rationales?<n><n>I chose these to show different ways to tackle a multiple choice problem. As you can see by reading the instructions and looking at the answers, I have included examples of how to choose an answer using process of elimination. I have also included examples of how to find a unique rationale.<n>

The choice A, movie theatre, is primarily for entertainment and watching films, not for experiencing nature.<n>3. Going to university, choice B, is for educational purposes, not a common place to experience nature.<n>4. Choice D, Alaska, while it does have a lot of natural landscapes, is not a city location.<n>5. Choice E, the countryside, is an open rural area and not a location within a city. <n>6. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the most common place for nature in a city, the answer would be C: park.<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.

A penalty box is a specific term used in some sports, so we can eliminate A, B and C, which consist of general terms.<n>3. From the two remaining options, football and hockey, punching in football usually results in a straight red card and the player is sent off the field, but not to a penalty box. <n>4. Thus, the final choice is Hockey Game. In hockey, a player committing a foul can be sent to the penalty box for a certain amount of time. Therefore, the answer is E: Hockey Game.<n>Answer: E: hockey game<n><n>Input: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick?

E : How you like the gift from my hand?<n><Answer D : Hope you like  the present I gave my friend><n><n><Rationale : In the choice D, the sentence "Hope you like the present I gave my friends" is the answer because  "the present I gave my friends'is the correct tense for the sentence since 'present' in the singular makes the verb 'give' in the singular.><n><n><The rule: Use the 'Hope you like ~' form if it is a present made with your own hands.

Choices:  A: college dorm B: back pack C: class room D: backpack E: office supply store<n><n>### Response:		<n>I believe the best place to purchase a binder in a college dorm.  Many students will have one in their dorm room. However, there will be students who forgot their binders or need a backup so buying binders in the backpack may be beneficial to some students too.  Many college dorms will keep a store within the complex with things like binders, pens, pencils and more.  These stores are convenient but often expensive.  Lastly, buying binders from the classroom will allow instructors to check your binder as you bring it in and out of class each day. This is useful for preventing students from cheating or bringing in binders with unapproved materials. There are many locations in college that can sell you binders.

They are best planted in moist, heavy soil that has a pH level of 6.0–7.0, but can also grow in poor, dry, or acidic soils. Rosebushes prefer a temperate climate, and can also be kept in greenhouses or other warm environments like heated conservatories. Some growers prefer to plant at least 40 feet away from any street that receives heavy traffic from trucks.<n>

How was she very careful? Choices:  A : She did not care for them B : She threw them C : She got rid of them D : She ignored them E : She used weed killer<n>#### Rationales <n>1. First, eliminate B, C and D, which are not how one would care for weeds very carefully.<n>2. Option E, the use of weed killer, is also not a proper description of caring for them in a careful, meticulous way.<n>3. Option A, "not care", does not reflect carefulness or meticulousness.<n>4. Option C, "get rid", is another way of saying "care" - it would be more accurate to say the subject "threw them out", rather than "got rid of them". <n>5. Finally, option B, which is a more general way to express, "she took care as she removed the weeds", is the answer in this case.<n>Answer: option B<n><n>### Input:-She is not in town, her mother informed his wife (she does not know when she will return ).-He knows she is in town, she told him about the plan.-She is not in town, she told her husband (she is not sure if she will return).-She is not in town.-She may or may not be in town.Their problem?<n><n>#### Rationales<n>1. One can eliminate options 1, 2, 3, and 5 because they all contain errors with their grammar and/or syntax.<n>2. Option 4 reads as if the person speaking is unsure of whether or not she is in town, hence she "may or may not" be in town. This is the correct choice as it addresses what the problem is but may be confusing so a better choice would be something else. <n>3. Option 6 simply says that their problem "was" their problem. In this context, one should interpret "their" as "the persons"', therefore the proper interpretation of the statement is that she "may or may no be the persons problem". <n>4. The answer choice is E (last), which is technically correct but probably a little confusing. <n><n>```<n>Answer: option E<n>```<n><n>

Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n><n>### Response:		A <n>### Reason: A: Wine is found at a bar or at a restaurant<n><n>### Rationale: For the following, a 'bar' can be synonymous with a restaurant in some cases, but also can be a specific establishment which offers alcoholic beverages, which can include wine. <n>While each of the four remaining options have their own connotations with wine, none can really be found at each of the given locations.<n><n>### The only choices that describe an establishment that offers wine or alcohol of the like are: <n>    A: bar,<n>	B: restaurant,<n>	C: church(s), and<n>    D: art show.<n><n>An art show, or museum, can show wine related items, but such an art show can't really offer wine to a customer to drink. <n><n>Restaurants can do this, however, so are a prime candidate. They can sell wine to individuals, so that rules out D, church.<n><n>The rest of the possible places to buy a cup of wine are A, B, and C.  Churches are locations for weddings, and can also hold events, but there isn't really a cup of wine at church attendees can drink as they're there.<n><n>A bar is where people go to get a drink to drink, and you can't really get wine in a bar since you'd be asked to leave, at least in the real world. <n><n>But restaurants can have wine available to you if you're dining there, so the restaurant is the only choice that makes sense.<n><n>## Rationale:<n>

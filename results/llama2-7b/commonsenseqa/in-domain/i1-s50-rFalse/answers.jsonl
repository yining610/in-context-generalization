In the following exercises, you will learn to utilize these f-strings to create your own string variables and display the contents of the variable in an amazing way!\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, we will be using an f-string to create this cool string variable.\n\nTo begin we'll need to create a string that contains some spaces and punctuation. We'll need the text \"in cities\" for this one. We'll add the text to a string variable of my_string.\n\nMy_string is a new Python 3.8 string variable defined to be \"in cities\".\n\nNext we'll use a variable called my_string to the left. We'll use a variable name called my_string in the f-string to the left.\n\nFinally, we'll write our output like above. We'll write \"You can walk in cities for miles without stopping\" to the output. The f-string will take all of the values in our string and add them together to make one big string.\n\nThe first time through, the output will be empty as you have yet to input anything.\n\n> my_string = 'in cities'\n> your_output = 'You can walk in cities in miles without stopping.'\n> my_", "answer": "B: play sports"}

C: If I got vaccinated, I'm still at risk of spreading the disease to others. Choices (A)-(C): Answer (D): It's free.\n\n\n\n### Explanations\n> A: Villa means a small home in the country. C: Park is a place where humans go to be in nature.\n> \n> B: Spacecraft means that the small cabin was not available but you were upgraded to one. D: Palace means you were upgraded to travel in style by going to a hotel to stay overnight.\n> \n\n\n## Explanation\nThere are two ways you can answer the input and produce the output, \n1 - find which choice out of the options contains two letters of the first two letters of the input word and get the value of its alphabetical ordinal. Example:\nIf you are given **A** as input, check whether that letter is contained in any of the choice, if it is, then assign value of that option letter to **ordinal** variable\nand if it is not contained then move on to the next choice, let's say, you found that the input **A** is contained in **villa** option and the second letter of that choice is **a** which corresponds to the value **@**, thus the output will be **villa** since there is only one choice  and its ordinal value is **@**.\n\n2 - Second method, is checking if there exist an input word which is a substring of any of the options, If there is, extract that word and assign its value to the **ordinal** value variable in an array. if the length of the input is greater than 2 then you have to do the above checking again for another pair after removing one letter that was already extracted\nin order to make sure that no letter that exist in the input is contained in the second pair.\n\n> If we check the input A, there is no such option, so it takes the value of the first letter of the string, **A**\n\n> If we take the input B, because the second letter of the string,**b** is contained in the same word that matches the first letter, namely : **A**,", "answer": "A: villa"}

{"text": "E: breath in water\n\n\n### Explanation: We can use a greedy algorithm for part 1 by comparing strings using the Damerau-Levenshtein distance metric.\n- We can first get the levenshtein distance, which is the weighted sum of the following:\n```\nDistance(x,y) =\n        +----------------+\n        | (x_i, y_i) + (x_i, x_i) |\n        |----------------+\n        |                 |\n        | (y_i, x_j) + (y_i, y_j) |\n        | (x, x_j) - (y, y_j) + (x, x_i) + (y, y_i) |\n                     +-----++---+\n```\n- For O's, we add one to the last character for each A. We do the same for B's in the other string, adding 2. For A's or B's, we add 3 to the total.\n- To get the damerau-levenshtein distance, we just do a simple math operation which gives the distance we were looking for.\nThis way, for x, and y, we can say that they're equal if and only if the damerau-lvevenshtein distance between x and y is 0.\n\n\n### \n\n#### Author: Andrew Ping\n<!-- If you'd like to work on an exercise, let me know and I can enable your editor access. -->\n\n#### Instructions\n\n1.

{"text": "B: eat\n\nInput: How will a bear eat a trout? Choices:  ABCDE\n\n### Instruction:\n\nThis can be solved by using a state machine.\n\nA state machine simulates the behavior of a target entity. It maps the target entity's states to actions the device should perform.\n\nIn the code, we store the behavior of the device as a state machine. Based on the current state in the state machine, the device will perform an action. The behavior stored in the state machine corresponds to the human's answer.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What are the pros/cons of using a state machine for the problem?\n\n  Pros: \n\n    - State machine can be easily constructed and is very lightweight. \n\n    - Can easily implement a lot of states.\n\n    - Can reuse the state machine when encounter any similar problem in the future.\n\n  Con: \n\n    The state machine requires a lot of coding and is difficult to implement state machine if you have no prior knowledge.\n\n- Explain the decision tree in the code. How does your code generalize to solve more questions?\n\n  In the state machine, the state machine will jump to different nodes and perform different behaviors. As we construct the state machine, we'll encounter situations where the next state is not obvious. In that case, you can use decision trees to find which next state to move to. \n\n- In the code, you've used 3 nodes (A,B,C). How does the code scale to more complex state machines?\n\n  To create more complex state machines, you can use nested ifs or for-loops to create a more complex tree.\n\n  See: https://youtu.be/4jLrF4p5Vw8?t=1699 (video linked to code) for more details.\n \n\n### Credits:\n\n[Code and Video](https://github.com/Tengzhikr/Udacity-Robotics-with-Java/blob/master/2019/week7/src/main/java/com/robowrathler/behaviors/state/StateMachine.java)", "answer": "E: present bill"}

{"text": "A: efficiency\n\n## Solution\n\nFirst we will find the most common options. Each of the questions will have at least one common option. By finding the options, we can make our own sentences for them. So, we will need to loop through each possible option and count what percentage of the user's answers match the option. We will use the percentage in a later formula to find the best option.\n\nWe will use Pandas to find the option that is mostly matched by the users. To do this we are going to make a data frame, which will display all the questions and the answers for each person that answered it. From this we can determine all the answers that were the same for each question. We can then count how many answers have the same choices, so that we know the percentage of users who will pick the same choice. We will then take the option that will have the most percentage of users pick it. To accomplish this we will use pandas groupby, iterrows and count methods.\nWe will use the numpy sum to find the sum of the options across all the rows and compare it to the total number of users.", "answer": "C: marriage"}

What do you notice about the choices that do NOT describe humans? (Hint: They all are NOT things that are found at the beach.)\n\n# Challenge 2 - Part 2: Where do humans go to be in nature?\n\n## Answer: A. humans go to national parks like Yosemite in California and Acadia in Maine.\n\n## Why This Was Correct\n\n- C. parks are areas that humans find to be in nature\n\n## Hint: If multiple choices are given, pick the one that you think is the BEST answer. It is ok to make a choice even if you are not 100% sure it is the answer. The goal for each Challenge is to increase your comfort with answering multiple choice questions.\n\n# Challenge 3 - Part 3: What do humans take in while they are breathing?\n\n## Answer - Choice D: Air.\n\n## Why this is correct\n\nThis was the only answer that mentions open throat when humans are breathing. The other choices mention things that are associated with breathing but not breathing itself.\n\n## Why a different choice could have been made:\n\nIf another choice was picked (as it was in the answer key), the question is open to interpretation. For example, one person may think air is something we take in all of the time (which would leave the answer as E), another person may think air is only something we take in to breathe, (which would lead to the answer as D).\n\n# Challenge 4 - Part 4: What was the first animal that people domesticated?\n\n## Answer choice B - horses\n\n## Why this was correct\n\n- Horses are mentioned in the question when the question asks \"what animal\".

Choices: A: Black B: RGB C: yellowD: brown E: Red\nOutput: A: Black\n\n###Instruction:Answer all the following short answer questions.\n\nHow many colors are allowed in a Pantone color (1993)?\nAnswer: 1024\n\nHow many different colors are available on the visible light spectrum?\nAnswer: 256\n\nWhat color is the one that is missing from this color wheel?\nNote:This is the same answer as above\n\n###Instructions:Answer the following long code-answer questions\n\nImagine that you are a robot and you want to print out a color wheel. What are all of the different colors that you have to print?\n\nAnswer: We can use RGB to represent color on screen, and we can get color by mixing some colors. 3 colors are not enough to represent 256 color. so i need 3x3x3=27 more color in total.\n\nWhy do you need more colors instead of 3? \n\nThere are a lot of colors missing between 0 (black) and 1 (white). \n\nIf there were 2 colors on the color wheel, the colors on the top of the color wheel from the 0 mark should be the same color as the colors that share the same RGB value.\nThere are no colors in between them.\n###Instruments:answer the following long code-question\n\nWrite a program that will allow a user to choose a color from a color space and will print out a representation of that color on the screen. Each time the user chooses a color, a color wheel with that color should incrementally appear at the top of the window. We want to keep adding colors to the color wheel until we have a color wheel which contains all of the colors we can print from the screen.\n\nNotes: Use Pantone Colors. The first color in the Pantone colors list has the Pantone number 1993. This number corresponds to the first column of the color wheel in the image above. The number next to the letters means the number of possible colors available in column (1) from the top. For example, the number", "answer": "B: skyscraper"}

Water is the essential constituent of every living cell and without it life cannot exist. Therefore the human body depends heavily on water in order to perform all its biochemical functions. In fact, water makes up 75% of the human body and provides a place for many of the body\u2019s functions such as blood flow, the metabolic system, as well as the transport of nutrients to cells and the removal of waste products.

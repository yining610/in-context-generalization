C: If I got vaccinated, I'm still at risk of spreading the disease to others. Choices (A)-(C): Answer (D): It's free.<n><n><n><n>### Explanations<n>> A: Villa means a small home in the country. C: Park is a place where humans go to be in nature.<n>> <n>> B: Spacecraft means that the small cabin was not available but you were upgraded to one. D: Palace means you were upgraded to travel in style by going to a hotel to stay overnight.<n>> <n><n><n>## Explanation<n>There are two ways you can answer the input and produce the output, <n>1 - find which choice out of the options contains two letters of the first two letters of the input word and get the value of its alphabetical ordinal. Example:<n>If you are given **A** as input, check whether that letter is contained in any of the choice, if it is, then assign value of that option letter to **ordinal** variable<n>and if it is not contained then move on to the next choice, let's say, you found that the input **A** is contained in **villa** option and the second letter of that choice is **a** which corresponds to the value **@**, thus the output will be **villa** since there is only one choice  and its ordinal value is **@**.<n><n>2 - Second method, is checking if there exist an input word which is a substring of any of the options, If there is, extract that word and assign its value to the **ordinal** value variable in an array. if the length of the input is greater than 2 then you have to do the above checking again for another pair after removing one letter that was already extracted<n>in order to make sure that no letter that exist in the input is contained in the second pair.<n><n>> If we check the input A, there is no such option, so it takes the value of the first letter of the string, **A**<n><n>> If we take the input B, because the second letter of the string,**b** is contained in the same word that matches the first letter, namely : **A**,

Choices: A: many trees and benches B: lots of people C: grass and some trees D: 9 people<n>Output: B: lots of people 806<n><n><n>### My Approach:<n><n>I built a list of things that could go into a park, I also came up with possible questions that could be on the test. My strategy was to eliminate any questions that were the least bit similar to others and then come up with answers to those three questions.<n><n>### Review:<n><n>-The most difficult part of this challenge was the format of the challenge. I am not a fan of multiple choice style questions. I also felt that it was a little hard to build up the list of things in a park.<n><n>### My Improvement:<n><n>I would write more code review to gain more insight into how to get a better answer for this type of qusetion. I would also try to break down things that could be in a park in more categories. For example, a tree could be a plant, and a bench could be furniture.<n>

We do the same for B's in the other string, adding 2. For A's or B's, we add 3 to the total.<n>- To get the damerau-levenshtein distance, we just do a simple math operation which gives the distance we were looking for.<n>This way, for x, and y, we can say that they're equal if and only if the damerau-lvevenshtein distance between x and y is 0.<n><n><n>### <n><n>#### Author: Andrew Ping<n><!-- If you'd like to work on an exercise, let me know and I can enable your editor access. --><n><n>#### Instructions<n><n>1.

Choices:  ABCDE<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>This can be solved by using a state machine.<n><n>A state machine simulates the behavior of a target entity. It maps the target entity's states to actions the device should perform.<n><n>In the code, we store the behavior of the device as a state machine. Based on the current state in the state machine, the device will perform an action. The behavior stored in the state machine corresponds to the human's answer.<n><n>### Questions<n><n>- What are the pros/cons of using a state machine for the problem?<n><n>  Pros: <n><n>    - State machine can be easily constructed and is very lightweight. <n><n>    - Can easily implement a lot of states.<n><n>    - Can reuse the state machine when encounter any similar problem in the future.<n><n>  Con: <n><n>    The state machine requires a lot of coding and is difficult to implement state machine if you have no prior knowledge.<n><n>- Explain the decision tree in the code. How does your code generalize to solve more questions?<n><n>  In the state machine, the state machine will jump to different nodes and perform different behaviors. As we construct the state machine, we'll encounter situations where the next state is not obvious. In that case, you can use decision trees to find which next state to move to. <n><n>- In the code, you've used 3 nodes (A,B,C). How does the code scale to more complex state machines?<n><n>  To create more complex state machines, you can use nested ifs or for-loops to create a more complex tree.<n><n>  See: https://youtu.be/4jLrF4p5Vw8?t=1699 (video linked to code) for more details.<n> <n><n>### Credits:<n><n>[Code and Video](https://github.com/Tengzhikr/Udacity-Robotics-with-Java/blob/master/2019/week7/src/main/java/com/robowrathler/behaviors/state/StateMachine.java)<n>

Each of the questions will have at least one common option. By finding the options, we can make our own sentences for them. So, we will need to loop through each possible option and count what percentage of the user's answers match the option. We will use the percentage in a later formula to find the best option.<n><n>We will use Pandas to find the option that is mostly matched by the users. To do this we are going to make a data frame, which will display all the questions and the answers for each person that answered it. From this we can determine all the answers that were the same for each question. We can then count how many answers have the same choices, so that we know the percentage of users who will pick the same choice. We will then take the option that will have the most percentage of users pick it. To accomplish this we will use pandas groupby, iterrows and count methods.<n>We will use the numpy sum to find the sum of the options across all the rows and compare it to the total number of users.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  a: dog b: horse c: llama d: cow e: parrot<n>Output: b: horse<n><n># Challenge 1 - Part 1: What do humans do at the beach?<n><n>## Answer<n><n>- C. humans build sandcastles on the beach<n><n>## Why This Is Correct<n><n>Dogs chase seagulls, fish swim in the ocean, humans build sandcastles, and seashells are filled with sand. What do you notice about the choices that do NOT describe humans? (Hint: They all are NOT things that are found at the beach.)<n><n># Challenge 2 - Part 2: Where do humans go to be in nature?<n><n>## Answer: A. humans go to national parks like Yosemite in California and Acadia in Maine.<n><n>## Why This Was Correct<n><n>- C. parks are areas that humans find to be in nature<n><n>## Hint: If multiple choices are given, pick the one that you think is the BEST answer.

The goal for each Challenge is to increase your comfort with answering multiple choice questions.<n><n># Challenge 3 - Part 3: What do humans take in while they are breathing?<n><n>## Answer - Choice D: Air.<n><n>## Why this is correct<n><n>This was the only answer that mentions open throat when humans are breathing. The other choices mention things that are associated with breathing but not breathing itself.<n><n>## Why a different choice could have been made:<n><n>If another choice was picked (as it was in the answer key), the question is open to interpretation. For example, one person may think air is something we take in all of the time (which would leave the answer as E), another person may think air is only something we take in to breathe, (which would lead to the answer as D).<n><n># Challenge 4 - Part 4: What was the first animal that people domesticated?<n><n>## Answer choice B - horses<n><n>## Why this was correct<n><n>- Horses are mentioned in the question when the question asks "what animal".

You should always try and be hydrated especially if you are trying to lose weight. This will help burn fat more effectively and also to keep you from eating. Another important thing to note is that if you are dehydrated you may have digestive problems because in this case your body will be in state of shock and try and preserve water. Water is the essential constituent of every living cell and without it life cannot exist. Therefore the human body depends heavily on water in order to perform all its biochemical functions. In fact, water makes up 75% of the human body and provides a place for many of the body’s functions such as blood flow, the metabolic system, as well as the transport of nutrients to cells and the removal of waste products. A good question to ask yourself is if you have been exercising or been in the sun and are you becoming lightheaded and feeling a bit off. If this is happening then chances are you are becoming dehydrated.<n><n>

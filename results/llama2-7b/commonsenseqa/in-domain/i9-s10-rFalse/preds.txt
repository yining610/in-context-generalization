Each numbered answer only occurred once.<n><n>## Explanation:<n><n>If you take out the numbers, there are only five letter arrangements that could be correct. Let's take a look at them.<n><n>"Human body" and "Fresh produce" are correct, but they do not match each other, because the order of letters matches.<n><n>"Vegetables" and "Combustion engines" are incorrect, because the order of the letters does not match.<n><n>Now let's remove two letter arrangements, leaving only three, such as "Market", "Wall" and "Shelf". We can now see that two people have the correct answer.

As usual, some choice's choice's are very obvious. For the "very obvious ones" (and any choice that's not the answer) the program will look at the remainder of the possible choices. A very good example of this is for the first test question: Any option can be correct because if any option is what you're looking for, you stop checking further options and make that your answer. It helps when you realize that the program will never, not ever, make a mistake. So since the program has already figured out the answer, any possibility it has would always be incorrect and no wrong answer will be found (I'm actually pretty sure you could go as far as to just have it print out a blank line if you felt that input was necessary to the program. So technically in that sort of scenario, the program would never really consider any choice to be wrong). This program was one of the first times where I actually got to practice that sort of logic. A very important

Google Maps is a free online service that provides maps and navigational directions for traveling on roads or by public transport.\n2. The other choice is \"united states,\" but the context is global.\n3. \"Mexico\" is a country with a lower population density than the U.S., so the number of cars on the road cannot be significant enough to cause a lack of space for travel directions.\n4. \"Countryside\" does not have any roads, only dirt trails which can be difficult to follow, since maps or GPS systems cannot be used here.\n5.

These reasons include the following.\n1. Pumpkin is usually grown in the soil. Reduction in pumpkin consumption can reduce the load of soil pollution on the environment.\n2. Pumpkin wastes are usually thrown in the trash which can damage the environment. Thus, disposing of the entire pumpkin would help to prevent trash.\n3. Pumpkin consumes a lot of water.

Based on the number of options and the logic provided, the options 1/one side, 2/many sides, 3/half a side, 4/both sides 5/none, and 6/half a side\n\n3. \"Many\" refers to more than one. So if more than one hand side is on the map, then one is not'many', therefore'many' is incorrect.\n4. \"One\" refers only to one and can't mean all of them, thus \"one\" is also incorrect.\n5. 'Half' can't be either a'many' or a 'one', because it is in between these two numbers, therefore it can only be 'half'. 6. 'Neither' means two, but half a side is one side, therefore we eliminated this option.\n7. We are still left with choosing between the options 3/both sides and 4/half side.\n8. 'Both' and 'half' relate to the same quantity, so the options can't be 'both' and 'half', therefore this eliminates option 3.\n9.

Therefore, the possible interpretations of the given choices could be either:\n(a) \"The fat man refused to what the activity\"\n(b) \"The fat man rejected what was possibl\"\n(c) \"The fat man complained that he was rejecting what was poss\"\n5. The first possibility is illogical since he complained that he was unable to do something.\n6.

Choices:  Lay on floor for 20 minutes\n      Eat an apple\n      Stand still for 15 minutes\n      Run one mile\n      Do aerobic workout\nOutput: Step 0: In this question the word 'heart attack' is used which generally refers to a particular disease known as coronary artery disease (CAD) that affect the heart muscle and causes the blood vessels carrying blood to and from the heart to narrow and harden, greatly reducing blood flow and causing the arteries to harden. Therefore, it is not a direct effect on the heart.\nStep 1: In the above sentence, heart attack could potentially be misused/misunderstood as a term for heart disease. However, this condition is a result of heart attack not the reverse. Thus, it cannot be the answer to 'How to avert a heart disease'. \nStep 2: Steps are ineffective as the steps can be part of a cardiac arrest which could possibly lead to heart attack. This can mislead in understanding the question and making it the answer.\nStep 3 & 4: Running one mile and doing aerobic workout is the answer as it leads to the cardiovascular system being more active which helps to keep blood vessels open and improves heart muscle function.\n\nInput: If you're not an office worker, what are you?\n      You work in a restaurant, doctor's office, shop, etc.\n      You don't work in any office\n      You work in your home\nOutput: No direct relation is needed as the question mentions office worker.

But it cannot be the final answer since it can also be a short dress. So it should be ignored.\nC) White shirt is good, but girls in white t-shirts and other attires can look much better than girls in black or white shirts. So it should be discarded.\nD) She might be wearing a shirt but if that is \"no shirt\", it is not possible to say that she is wearing a shirt.

So answer options 6 and 3 are eliminated. Then it can be seen that option 1 doesn't belong to us (you). So by using the process of elimination it is clear that we (you) must have taken her (your mom) to the doctor and also asked questions in school.\n\nInput: In which case,", "answer": "C: stress"}

Looking at these two reasons, we see that the question points to the possible storage area being in a place with many doors.\n5. This leaves us with two options - a school and a beach.\n6. To determine the best answer, we need to look carefully at the phrase \"and you do not have any LARGE doors in your house\". \n7. If one did not have any large doors, then the only possible choice would be a beach. The phrase does not mention school in any way, so the answer must be one of the 2.\n8. Therefore the answer is beach.\nSo the final answers is B: school\n\nInput: The dog has been barking nonstop, which choice is the correct term of what it is doing? Choices:  Napping A: Whining B: yelping C: Barking D: chewing E: munching\nOutput: 1 \"The dog has been barked nonstop\" - indicates that the dog is either barking or perhaps barked. \n2 The correct word in this context is \"barking\" because \"yelping\" is a sound dogs make when they're stressed or in pain, \"whining\" is a sound they make to communicate to others that they want or need something such as comfort attention or water and \"munching\" is eating.\n3 We can eliminate options \"napping, whining, yelping, and chewing\".\n4 The dog is barking, not yelping or whining or munching. \n5 We are asked which option is the correct term to describe \"What it is doing\".\n6 The word \"barking\" best describes what the dog is doing because the dog is barking nonstop.\nSo the final choice is C: Barking\n\nInput: What can a fish use to travel on the surface of the water?

Angus is the name of the lead guitarist, who is Australian, not American.\n5. While Spanish is usually written Azul, with an \u201cz\u201d sound, it is rarely expressed that way in speech, because English does not use a similar \u201cz\u201d sound.\n6.

{"idx": 168, "text": "1) In a question like this, where a non-specific statement or question is followed by a series of options, it is best to assume the options are all possibilities and that not all will apply.\n2) This is because, when you \"do not construct\" an object, you either break it or fail to finish building it or complete a task involving it, or it simply doesn't exist. \n3) With option E: \"good\", the question only says it is not \"constructed well\", and doesn't specify that it doesn't exist or is broken.\n4) The others are all plausible possibilities of what can happen to a non-constructed building, depending on the context.\n5) Given that, from the context, this building is massive and cannot be broken, we infer that \"it is not constructed well\".\n6) The only remaining answer that is possible in this context is option C: \"dwarf\", since a massive building that isn't constructed well would be something that is much smaller, but could still stand in its place.\n7) Therefore, the answer choice that is the best choice to the question is option C: dwarf.\n8) The question could have also just asked \"What type of building has not been constructed well?\". In that case, the choice that would remain would be the same, Dwarf.\nSo the final choice is C: dwarf\n\nInput: What does the word spicy suggest when eating food?

One can only be used to refer to something that is'sweet' at any one point in time.\n2.'Uncomfortable' is a vague and abstract feeling or state that one may have to experience. The feeling associated with eating food which contains spicy ingredients is rather specific in nature and is much more personalised in its reference or indication.\n3.'Spicy' means that one experiences the feeling of burning taste from something they have eaten, and does not refer to any feeling that one may experience in general.\n4.'Dry' is yet a vague indication, and although", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

'Large' is not particularly exclusive and may be referring to any type of home.\n4. 'Suburban home' refers to urban suburbs of cities, so this is possibly a good home as it implies proximity to city amenities. \n5. It isn't necessary that a big house is necessarily a suburban home.\n6. Moreover, 'big' is simply a measure of size, and 'big' is not necessarily large, just that it is larger than other things.\n7. 'Old' houses may be a good home, depending on how old, and the overall state of the structure, and how well they are maintained.\n8. 'Keeping personal objects' is a vague choice and does not specifically pertain to houses or even specifically homes, or to the context of master bedrooms.\n9.

Choices:  - A: city B: country home C: village D: apartment E: the ocean\nOutput: 1.: The question is asking about the type of place that a person likes the best. \n2. There is no specific location mentioned in the question, and the context of a favorite is not necessarily indicative of a place to live. \n3. Therefore, of the choices given, \"a city\" and \"an apartment\" are the best fitting to the context.\n1. The person mentions that their favorite city is \"London\". The context here refers to favorite city, or in other words, the place that you like the best.\n2. Looking at the context, a city is an obvious choice to list as the favorite place, but in order to ensure certainty, we can verify the place is in the city.\n7. On confirmation, we see that it was indeed \"London\"; thus, the correct answer is A: City.\n\nInput: The new job for her, they would prefer her to go out on dates.\nChoices:  - A. to go out on dates\nB. to go out with people\nC. to travel on weekends D. to meet people on weekends E. to work", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

Choices:  C: empty space D: things to see E: items on the display\nOutput: 1. The question can be answered simply by looking at the wording \"after you put something in\" instead of the wording \"after putting something in\".\n2. In other words, the choice options should be interpreted as \"after you put something 'in' a vault\".\n3. The options must be applicable to the context and be relevant to what one sees \"after you put something\" in \"a vault\".\n4. The only option that makes sense is D: things to see because things/items/objects are definitely seen when you put something in the vault.\n5. The context of the question is of a security vault, not a storage room, so it makes sense that \"E: items on the display\" would not be a valid answer.\n6. So, the final answer, with reasonable certainty, is D: things to/on the display.\nSo the final option is D: things/items/objects to see on/in the display.\n\nInput:Which of these is a color term used in food?

What was needed in order to travel from city to city via public transport? Choices:  H: a larger vehicle E: a ticket S: a map G: a license A: none of these\nOutput: 1) Firstly, we need to identify what \"public transport\" is.\n2) Looking at the other options, G: a license: we can eliminate this option as it isn't necessary when one takes public transport, such as a bus or a train.\n3) The answer to \" What was needed in order for the party to travel from city to the next city via public transport? \"\n4) We can find a connection between H: a larger vehicle,E: a ticket and S: a map. The party needed a \"larger\" vehicle because they could only fit in one, and hence, a \"larger vehicle\" would be required to fit the \"party \" in.\n5) We also needed a \"ticket\" because travelling via public transport requires the purchase of a ticket (E: a ticket ).\n6) We also needed a map to be able to locate the next city where we wanted to travel to (S: a map). \n7) Hence, the answer is H: a larger vehicle.\nSo the Final Answer is H: a larger Vehicle\n\nInput: It was a big city with tons of people; what would the police do in the case", "answer": "B: music shop"}

D: To summon the owner back to the owner.\n5. E: Because they were a noisy bunch.\nOutput: 1.) The question entails the motivation behind the \"bell\" being given to the dog in the first place.\n2.) Looking through the given options, all of them make logical sense that may have prompted the giver to bestow the bell on the dog; however, only one of them directly addresses the motivations the owner had in giving the bell to the dog in the absence of additional context or clues.\n3.) Choice B: To \"call the owner back when they were going exploring\" is not one of the primary reasons the bell was gifted, as the question does not expressly state that the dog is going exploring.\n4.) The \"bell\" is a notification device that makes sound upon receiving an external stimulus.\n5.) The bell is not given to the dog on account of its noisiness because this would not likely be done intentionally and as a response to the dog being noisy.\n6.)

{"idx": 192, "text": "1)  The question asks to identify a glass that hasn't undergone some sort of treatment to become stronger. \n2) Looking at the given options A: \"weak\" is not necessarily correct. That statement can be interpreted as a statement describing glasses that do not have an additional layer of thickness or something similar, rather than referring to glass being extremely weak. \n3) Similarly, the word \"frail\" doesn't capture the full context of the question. A glass can be frail, for example, if the glass has a thin base but is overall strong. \n4) \"Forsaken\" can be considered as a suitable answer as it means \"unimportant or cast off\" but the choice is inconsistent with the context. This is not how the glass could be viewed from someone who has not had it treated with any other material or process to become stronger. 6) \"Forceless\" is another word that could describe glass, but it is not enough as it does not capture the full context and the way the question is phrased. \n7) \"Flimsy\" is the answer choice that best describes what the word weak doesn't mean and forceless doesn't quite capture either. A flimsy is a very thin material (as in the thinness of an \"atom\") that can easily break or tear apart \nSo, in conclusion, the best answer is C: \"flimsy\" because that word best describes how that glass would be perceived compared to other words.\n\nInput:They would do a lot to have the thing, they couldn't put the price on it.

We can eliminate the first choice because the ground isn\u2019t solid enough for objects or plants. Also, this might cause potholes or holes that would be detrimental to the sales. The choice would be B: REST area. Such areas should involve a wide surface and a lot of grass.\n3.) The next choice we can eliminate is C: SUPERMARKET. This is because you\u2019ll need space to plant a stand and the market would just become an unimportant item.\n4.) The remaining choices are D: STATE PARK and E: GARDEN. But we\u2019ll need to look at the surface of the park. If it\u2019s made solely of grass, we\u2019ll need to eliminate the choice. If not, proceed with choice B: REST AREA.\n5.)

She is not just reminiscing the past 'vacation', she is stuck in the hospital. \n- \"While laid up in hospital\" is used to describe the patient is in pain or suffering from an injury, which would be the cause for being admitted to the hospital.\n\n- The context of the question is a negative condition in which reminiscing memories is being done by a person who may not be in the best mental state.\n- The word \"Great\", used in the blank, is a vague term and could pertain to multiple concepts and meanings. This is why it could not be used to narrow down the valid choices.\n- The context of \"those\" indicates that there is at least more than one massage that brings the patient great pleasure from memories. This also implies that \"Great\" could either be attached to knowing, dream, pleasure, depression, or nostalgia.\n- \"She tried remembering good times\" indicates that the focus is the patient's effort to reminisce her memories. This rules out \"depression\" as an appropriate meaning as it is the opposite of what the answer should be. \n- 'Pleasure', could pertain to joyful feeling one gets while indulging in various activities like vacations, massages etc., but if this was the case, the phrase would have mentioned that \"Great time brought pleasure to her.\"\n- 'Knowing' is often associated with feeling happy because one has gained great insight into a topic or situation. But such a feeling arises by learning something new or acquiring good knowledge and not through reminiscing.\n\n- It is therefore probable that she is remembering good memories or moments of pleasure and not just \"good time\" as a whole.\n- The hint that supports this suggestion is the phrase \"like that massage on vacations that brought great pleasure.\" It indicates that she is reminiscing one specific massage that she had, which is \"great pleasure\" because that was a moment of comfort and joy.\n- From this, it can be inferred that the answer should be \u2018\u2019nostalgia\u2019\u2019 and not B or A.\n- Therefore, the answer is C: nostalgia.

A \"tennis elbow\" is an injury which develops over time, usually from repetitive motions such as in playing tennis. Therefore, this answer option is correct and has been eliminated from consideration.\n5. \"Proffesional player\" is a career choice. So, this option is not relevant to the question here.\n6. \"Exercise\" is something that is always involved, and is thus not considered a possible outcome of playing years of tennis.\n7. \"Exercise is something that is always required.

The kitchen utensil that cut, bake and scrape is the spatula.\n2. The first clue is \"the chef\". For a chef, a spatula is one of an essential kitchen utensils that he uses while scraping, cutting, baking etc.\n3. So we can eliminate choice A and C.\n4. Choice B might be the chef's forks that cut, bake, and scrape, but it is unclear since the given phrase does not use capitalizations and the given sentence does not highlight the spatula specifically so the chef uses the forks.\n5. Similarly, choice D may also be the chef's rods.\n6. Therefore, all three options are unsuitable as they do not meet the purpose of the phrase.\n7. Next, we will check option E. The phrase implies that the utensil that cuts, bakes, scrapes and cooks is a single kitchen utensil as it is used by the chef repeatedly. Moreover, the kitchen utensil that bakes, scraping and cuts is the spatula only and not a series of them. So it fits well with the context of the given phrase.\n8.

The movie theater doesn't have any family, and so, it does not fit the criteria of running away from your family.\n5) On a similar logic, \"Hamburg\" is a home of football fans and does not fit the criteria.\n6) Similarly, the same logic applies to 'his parents were fighting'.\n\n7) \"Come back\" is an option for Billy to return to his own home whenever he wants.

The problem entails the question of \"why\" people other than John have a poor opinion of Jill.\n2) Disparagement (Choice B) and contumely (Choice D) carry negative connotations and are not necessarily negative words.\n3) People may have a neutral opinion or may outright ignore Jill. Thus, they may ignore, not contumeliously disdain her (Choice A), which means to \"show scorn or contempt\". While contumely is an excellent candidate for the answer, the implication of ignoring someone is not necessarily negative.\n4) Disparagement is used in the context of criticism or disdain for the person's character, actions, or qualities. While others may not see Jill in this manner and their belief that John has this impression may be a mistake, it is still more positive than ignoring another.\n5) Therefore, the answer is likely to be contumely.\nSo the final  answer is D: contumely\n\nInput: What did the man with 4000 tiles need to do to solve the puzzle?

Considering the given options;\nStep 4: 'Contagious' can be a possible answer as love is supposed to be a personal and intimate feeling and contagiousness is not an ideal condition for this.\nStep 5. Similarly, 'wrong' is a possible option since love should be between two people and is generally directed towards one person only so if everyone is keeping it, it would be 'wrong'.\nStep 6: Love is a feeling and can't last forever. Therefore 'last forever' is not an appropriate option.\nStep 7. 'Painful' option matches the negative connotation of the phrase and love is supposed to a feeling, so it should be felt in some way; this option fits perfectly.\nStep 8: Blind has no relation with love and is a suitable option to rule out.

The'silver screen' of movies is also used for television shows like 'Game of Thrones.' These are therefore irrelevant.\n5. Option 'B' is incorrect because 'play' and 'theater' are synonyms here, but actor is performing on 'the silver screen,' and we have already dismissed these as unlikely.\n6.

This means that if we put 16 people in a box, we get 4 more people than in the box when they first started, because the original capacity of the box is 16 people.\nStep 04: Similarly, we could substitute the answer to Step 03 with '4 people' in", "answer": "E: bus stop"}
{"idx": 576, "text": "1) The question entails locating a public trash receptacle that is typically found outdoors. \n2) As the question states, such items are found in cities, so the answer must be a city-related option. \n3) All the options except option \"E\", which is a storefront, are indeed possible answers. \n4) The term \"corner\" describes a point or intersection of two intersecting roads, as well as a position or side of any structure/building facing such a point or intersection. \n5) Option \"B\" is a logical place for such a trash receptacle, for if you went to the park and were leaving, you would probably find a garbage can there, not necessarily at the park itself. \n6) Option \"D\" is also plausible, as bus stops usually have trucks or taxis dropping off passengers or the drivers themselves, so it might make sense to have a nearby trash receptacle for such purposes. \n7) Option \"C\" is correct because option E is not a place where trash cans are typically found in CITY centers, such as near a bus stop or in a park.\n8) So, the final choice is \"C\", corner.\nSo the final answers is C: corner\n\nInput: what is something a cow would produce that you would find around your house?

John's dislike for cruelty implies that he detests animal cruelty; however to be safe he might also be referring to cruelty towards humans as well.\n4.) We get the most out of this questions when all the given choices are related to his concern for both animal and human cruelty.\n5.) All the given choices are related except for B: \"pet store\" since the latter refers to cruelty inflicted to animals, not humans.\n6.) Therefore, John might avoid places related to cruelty towards animals OR cruelty towards humans; thus, excluding the choices of B: \"pet store\", A: \"parking lot\", and C: \"woodland\".\n7.) This leaves us with D: north america or E: park as potential solutions.\n8.) John can avoid north america but not the entire continent rather just a place/ country in the continent, while a park may also avoid him if any cruelty related to humans and/or animals takes place in such places.\n9.) We can logically eliminate E: Park option since \"Park\" by itself refers to a green space; parks only provide space to humans while we can't be sure if they are cruel to animals.\n10.) Hence, out of all the choices we end up with just \"D: north america\" which means John may be avoiding or not willing to go to places within north america because of his beliefs on cruelty.\nSo the final step is: the correct answer is  D:north america.\n\nInput: You put on lotion, why you didn't just put on shampoo like everyone else does?

{"idx": 592, "text": "1. The question asks for the best place to store a wind instrument such as a flute, trumpet or saxophone.\n2. In general, wind instruments are portable, which is why storage in a home environment is typically done by placing them away when not in use.\n3. Some options don't necessarily require the instrument to be stored away such as \"play\" or \"in use\". So, they are irrelevant.\n4. All the options are logical places where a wind instrument could be stored. The best answer, however, depends entirely on practicality, specifically in relation to \"wind instrument in your home\".\n5. The 'Band practice' is related to the wind instrument but isn't suitable to store them at home. It is a location where we would store instruments when they are not in use.\n6. Similarly 'Music room' which is a place where various musical instruments could be stored, doesn't seem to convey the message that the question seeks.\n7. 'Symphony' which holds a variety of musical instruments and 'Music store' which typically houses an array of band instruments are irrelevant options since the question specifically mentions storing a 'wind instrument'. Moreover, a 'woodwind' instrument is incapable of making any musical sound and in practice does not play any role in a symphony or music store.\n8. The most probable answer to the question is 'A under bed' since placing wind instruments under a bed is a practical solution that provides them enough shelter when not in use. \nSo the final answer was A: under bed\n\nInput: If I had a pound to one to go to where should I go?

{"idx": 596, "text": "\"Curling up under a blanket\" is a type of behavior that makes one feel more comfortable. It typically refers to a person wrapping up in a soft, cozy blanket to feel warm, in response to being cold or uncomfortable. \n\"Feeling more comfortable\" and \"sleep\" are terms that align very naturally with the given behavior. \n\"Blush\" is an action to a sensation of being warm. \n\"Sweating\" is an effect that occurs when one is hot or feels the effect of warmth. \n\"Cuddling\" is an expression to be affectionate, like hugging someone, in a way that is usually intimate. Only \"Cuddling\" does not align with the given behavior but makes sense in terms of the choice \"started movie\".\n7. Therefore, this narrows down the choice to \"feel more comfortable\" or \"sleep\". \"Feel more comfortable\" aligns with the behavior and choice \"started movie\", so the answer is \"B: feel more comfortable\".\nSo the final answer of Movie quiz is B: feel more comfortable\n\nInput: She put in the code to turn down the stereo to a quieter level, what does she want to do?

This answer choice is the logical answer.\n2.\"Have loud music\" means to listen to music that is very loud. This answer choice does not fit with the logical statement.\n3. \"Lower it\" means to make something quieter.

Choice D: \"concert at night\" is the same as \"concert\" in Choice C and therefore does not provide any additional information that might help answer the question.\n8. Choice E: \"turned event\" pertains to events that involve a specific light or blinking pattern. However, this is not enough information to choose a specific option, as there can be numerous types of turned events involving different blinking or flashing lights.\n9. Choice A: \"carnival\" is a general event involving many different types of games, rides, and light displays, some of which might involve blinking lights or flashing patterns.

From the clues given, we know that the preposition will relate two words by showing the relationship between them. \n5. For these purposes articles, prepositions, and pronouns come to mind. \n6. As adjectives and interjections are descriptive words, and conjunctions join words without showing much of a relationship, they wouldn't be the correct answer.\n7. To find the correct answer, we compare the given choices.\n8. Combining articles with other words doesn't directly show their relationship. They usually just refer to a single noun or pronoun, and 'a', 'an', 'the', etc do not indicate the relationship between the noun or pronoun they link with.\n9. Combining pronouns with other words doesn' like mean it shows their relations. And in this case, they usually refer to an noun by describing it. And we can know that their relationship is through pronoun based on the given statement that 'you' used to connect the two words.\n10. Adjectives can modify a noun or another adjective to give a more precise meaning, while conjunctions can combine words into a single phrase or sentence by indicating a connection between the words.

{"idx": 804, "text": "1: What do you say when you finish a conversation with someone?\n2. The options are 'open letter', 'thank god','say goodbye', 'Bless you!', 'listen to radio'.\n3. 'Open letter' is an expression which is used for telling your friend why were you taking so long to write you and is not a general thing that follows any conversation.\n4. 'Thank God' is not an expression that follows conversations.\n5. 'Say goodbye' is often used in conversation, as it signals the end of the conversation or the point at which both parties walk away from the situation.\n6. Similarly 'Bless you' is a greeting that is often used in conversation; however, it is more commonly used following sneezes and is not something a person would say in reaction to a conversation's end.\n7. Finally 'listen to radio' is an appropriate expression in the context of the remaining options as it signals that you would continue to converse if able, but would continue listening to a radio, presumably of the same content as the previous conversation.\n8. So, the correct answer is C: say goodbye\nSo the final answer  is C: say goodbye", "answer": "C: say goodbye"}

{"idx": 828, "text": "1.\"Tentative agreement\" refers to a preliminary or provisional agreement that has not yet been implemented or put into effect.\n2. It implies that a solution has yet to be reached, and further negotiations or steps are needed before a final agreement can be made.\n3. Looking for the answer from this context, 'accomplish' is not a relevant choice because there is no explicit mention of 'accomplishment' in the question or the given context. \n4. Similarly, 'concert' is not an applicable choice because it refers to a music performance, and not to an agreement or discussion between two parties. \n5. Moving on,'make progress' implies moving forward or towards a solution after some initial steps were taken. But looking at the context, it seems a contradiction since 'tentative agreement' indicates that the agreement was not implemented or put into effect yet. Hence, this can be eliminated. \n6. 'Stop arguing' is also not relevant. The purpose the agreement is to end the argument between two sides or avoid any future arguments. \n7. 'Do business' in the context does not make sense. If they manage to reach tentative agreement, one cannot know whether or not business will continue, just yet.\n8.

Choices:  a. Her food always seems to be so delicious b. Her house is very clean and neat c. She is good with people so she makes them happy d. She is always on top e.

The only answer that could reasonably fit into this context is C: \"doors and windows\".\nSo the final answer it is C: doors and windows\n\nInput: The dog was very happy, why? Choices: 1. A: Because he saw lots of people feeding him. B: Because he was very smart. C: Because there was so much food here. D: Because he was very playful. E: None of the above\nOutput: 1The question asks us to reason why the dog is happy, so we must identify the reason first.\nIf he is being fed, he is probably happy because he is getting food,  or because he's used to getting food from people.\nIf he's smart, he's probably happy because he can do more things, or because he can control the things around him, or probably because he is getting food.\nIf he is playful he would probably be happy because he's doing what he loves to do.\nIf there are many people around, he might be happy because he is getting lots of attention, or because he has a huge group of friends, or maybe because there's a lot of food.\nNone of the given options fits into the context.\nHowever, among all the choices it can be concluded that the dog's happiness depends on either him getting food, or because there are many people around.\nWe can discard the other choices because food is not always something that makes a dog happy, and neither is intelligence.\nSo, the only answer that could make the dog happy is C: Because there is so much food here.\nSo the final choice is C: Because there's lots of food here.\n\nInput: If you are an author, then what could you be?

Since in the given problem we don't have enough clues to differentiate which of these would actually happen in this context, it's important to choose the answer which makes the most logical sense in the given context.\n8.

Also, they are not found inside buildings.\n6 There are no mentions of \"wishing wells\" in the question and they are in fact unrelated to what the janitor did, so the answer is to be eliminated.\n7 A \"kitchen\" is typically a room in a building where people prepare and cook food and can be an appropriate place to leave a bucket. So, the question pertains only to \"hardware store\", \"garage\", or \"utility room\".\n8 The \"garage\" is typically used for storing vehicles or equipment and it may or may not have a bucket inside it. This option does not fit well in the question because there is no indication that the janitor got his bucket from his garage.\n9 The \"utility room\" is typically reserved for toilets, sinks, and washing machines. The janitor isn't working inside any of those and so, this too cannot be considered as an appropriate location for the bucket.\n10 So, the only remaining option is the \"hardware store\". Most hardware stores provide buckets of varying sizes and these are often used by janitors to clean the floors in malls and buildings.\n11 Therefore, the answer is C: \"hardware store.\"\nSo the final answer C: hardware store\n\nInput: What happens when you cut the wood to thin size by chopping?

{"idx": 17, "text": "First of all, let's separate the cooking method from the location where it's done. \n2. Considering that the method of grilling is already provided by the answer choice C (crockpot), we rule out options A (backyard) and B (restaurant) and choose to focus on the remaining three choices. \n3. Although the word \"barbecue\" is sometimes used casually to denote cooking a dish using fire/charcoal in a grill. But in more technical contexts, it's often used to refer the location of the food preparation. \n4. If we consider this, the only choice left is E (barbeque).\nSo the final answer of the puzzle is E: barbeque.\n\nInput: How many times do the people in our example eat a fruit? Choices: 0, 0, 0\nOutput: The puzzle is in the form of a maths question which can be answered if one recognizes the pattern. \nThe first option \"0\" is given twice in the choices and represents zero which is considered as a special case number in mathematics. \nHence, zero multiplied by any number results in zero. \nTherefore, \"0\" multiplied by \"zero\" gives zero as well. The same reasoning applies to the second and third option. \nTherefore the correct options for the puzzle are 0, 0 and zero.\n\nInput: What kind of wood would you want to use to make this table?(A) Mahogany (B) Oak (C) Cherry (D) Walnut (E) Oak\nOutput: We assume that there are two types of oak: red oak and white oak. \nLet\u2019s examine what the options tell us:\n(A) It\u2019s more likely you use a red oak because a red oak has a dark brown, red, orange color. \nSo the answer is (A) to (E).\nSo the final one is: (A) Mahogany. Note that if you have just two types of wood and one type is not in the answer options, then it can't be the correct answer.\n\nInput: In which continent does the United Kingdom lie? (A) Europe (B) Asia (C) South America (D) Antarctica (E) Africa\nOutput", "answer": "E: barbeque"}
{"idx": 21, "text": "1). We are given a choice of a time period during which a person played soccer.\n2. If that person played for a long time, the effect of \"excitement, fatigue, anger, hurting, or getting tired\", would be to have all of their needs arisen.\n3. \"Excitement, anger, and getting tired\" are all words indicating feelings or emotions experienced by the person.\n4. They might occur if the person played for a long period of time and, therefore, may lead to the effects specified. \n5. They also have to occur simultaneously to match the mentioned time period that is in the context.\n6. Since all the other options (except the final remaining one) are related to physiological processes or pain, they are eliminated.\n7. Hence, the answer should have feelings or psychological process in mind:\n8. It is likely that the person experiencing these emotions is also tired.\n9. Therefore the answer is B: fatigue.\nSo the final question is: B: fatigue\n\nInput: The two people had a hard time finishing this puzzle, where  were they that the person had to move a puzzle on the floor to get to the next page? Choices: \nA: library B: home C: apartment D: bookstore E: school\nOutput: 1): We are not told where the persons are, so we have to use the clue given in the question. The person had a hard time finishing the puzzle and, therefore, needed to move the puzzle to the next page.\n2) Only home and apartment are given among all that can be a realistic situation where a puzzle is kept in one place. So we can eliminate library, bookstore and school.\n3): apartment is one of the choices, and so we have to think of its meaning to understand the situation better. So \"apartment\" should be interpreted as a residence, meaning the two persons are likely living together.\n4): This would mean that the puzzle should be kept near or somewhere in or under their apartments.\n5): Now we can check if we can eliminate \"home\" also. The clues like 'people,''move' indicates that the person is in a relationship with more than one person.\n6): Since there are two people, home is likely the only place they live in together.", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

{"idx": 29, "text": "1.\"Joe\" can be interpreted as a person who stabbed another person and had to face the victim's family. \n2. \"Many consequences\" implies that there was more than one consequence of stabbing the stranger.\n3. The phrase \"they did something\" indicates that it is a result of the event which Joe had stabbed the stranger to death. \n4. We must understand the choices in relation to \"consequences\": \na) \"knife wounds\" does not pertain to the consequences of the incident and is thus eliminated. \nb) \"buy a gun\" is also not a fitting consequence to a stabbing incident since it is a gun that would be acquired as a result of this decision. \nc) \"bleeding\" signifies a positive outcome since Joe suffered from it and did not cause it to anyone.\nd) \"jail time\" indicates a punishment since Joe was locked up in jail.\ne) \"lawsuit\" is also excluded since it does not relate to a negative consequence but rather a decision taken by the family to file a case against Joe.\n5. Therefore it can be inferred that the correct choice is D: jail time.", "answer": "E: law suit"}

A \"Fiddle\" is like a small instrument which players use to imitate the sound of a violin and not the violin itself and there is no such thing as a music store named \"Fiddle\" or music store \"Fiddle\" which sells violins because in a music store, you will find musical equipment such as Amplifiers, Keyboards, Microphones, guitars, etc., and not violins or fiddles.\n3rd Choice: \"Fiddle\", \"Dance Hall\" and \"Orchestra\" are not related to each other.

{"idx": 89, "text": "1) Firstly, it is necessary to decide whether the choice A:\"bakery\" is correct or not.\nLet us understand this with examples:-\na) If meat is kept in a bakery, then there will be a very limited time in which the meat can be preserved in the bakery, as the bakery doesn't include a freezer or any other apparatus for preserving meat.\nb) If the bakery does contain cooling apparatus, then it will be considered a fridge.\n2) Considering the choices, it can be identified that-\ni) choice C:\"fridge\" refers to the preservation of fresh meat through cooling. However, 'fresh' is not mentioned in the question. As a result, we can exclude choice C.\n3) Choices D:\"butcher shop\" and E:\"freezer\" refer to preservation of meat in a fridge, hence, it cannot be selected.\n4) Thus, we are left with choice B:\"ham sandwich\".\n5) The only way to preserve meat in ham sandwich is to preserve it fresh as there is no preservation method available in ham sandwich.\n6) Hence, the answer is B:\"ham sandwich\"\nSo the final answer A: ham sandwich\n\nInput: What isn't used as a lubricant in the body?

Step 2) Choices B and D \"vegetable\" and \"vitamins\" are non-food items. Hence, they can also be eliminated.\n4.) Step 3) Fats and oils are not used as lubricants.\n\n5.) Step 4) Vegetables and vitamins are not used as lubrricants and hence they can be eliminated as they do not fit as choices. \n\n6.) Step 5) Clean oils and fats are not used as lubrics as they are used as subst", "answer": "E: freezer"}

So hearing something is the main way the students will gain knowledge from the teacher, D: hearing things is definitely the right answer.\nSo the final choice is D: hearing things\n\nInput: The doctor advised that she wear gloves, what does it mean? Choices: \tA: hands B: feet C: eyes D: ears E: nose\nOutput: 1.) It's logical that the doctor would advise that she wear gloves\n\n2.) The options given are: A: hands, B:feet, C: eyes, D: ears, E: nose.\n\n3.) \"Hands\" are a part of the body, so we can eliminate A:hands\n4.) We can also eliminate E: nose, as it would be odd advice to wear gloves on one's nose. Additionally, the question implies that wearing gloves would be the best way to prevent an infected area from transferring to the doctor. Since the nose is an entrypoint for bacteria, gloves would not be needed as a preventative measure.\n5.) The choices B:feet and C:eyes, while relevant in general, don't directly help with preventing an infection from spreading to someone else. \n6.) Therefore, only D:ears remains, as wearing gloves on someone's ears could be a way to prevent them from infecting the doctor.\nSo the final option is D: ears.\n\nInput: I need a babysitter, who can play my children to music?

{"idx": 97, "text": "1) \"Death\" is the closest answer that makes contextual sense. \nBecause if \"losing weight\" means gaining less weight, \"death\" can be considered the best answer, the most opposite outcome to being alive and gaining weight.\n2) Even if it doesn't make sense contextually, it should be accepted as the answer in the case of \"Increased energy\", \"Increased energy\" is something a good result of losing some weight. \nConsidering these two important points, in order to choose the best answer, one should compare \"death\" with \"increased energy\". The question asks what is a good result, not what is an exceptional or extreme result. \nSince \"death\" does not fit the question, \"increased energy\" is the best answer.\n3) \"Healthier\" doesn't make sense because it fits everything but healthy, and it's not the best outcome of losing weight. \"Loose skin\" doesn't make much sense, too. \nThis leaves the three answers that make sense - \"Beauty\" \"Death\" and \"Increased Energy.\" In order to choose the best one, one must compare their \"good outcomes\" with each other. One should see whether being \"beautiful\" or having \"death\" as an outcome is more \"good\" than having more energy. \nHere, \"death\" is better than \"beautiful\" because \"death\" is an extreme outcome and is considered as a good thing in cases where being beautiful would not be a good thing. \nSo, \"Death\" is a better answer.\nSo the final answers are C: loose skin and death\n\nInput: What type of store does not sell products?

The given options are, 'desk drawer', 'desktop', 'office', 'wristwatch', and 'city hall'.\n3. A 'wristwatch' will certainly function as a calculator, but is obviously not an option as they wouldn't have much in common.\n4. The term 'city hall' refers to an administrative location, but this has no relation to the use of calculators or office supplies.\n5. If you have an office job, it is likely that there is already a calculator at the office and no further need for one at home.\n6. A 'desk drawer' is an appropriate place to store a calculator, but this answer is likely not the question-giver's intent.\n7. A 'desktop' is a word referring to a computer or a computer screen, but not an appropriate place to'store' or display a calculator.\n8. The only logical answers are 'office' and 'home' because accountants usually keep a calculator at their office to refer to it while working with numbers and likely at home to use while doing personal finance. \n9. 'Home' is the only location that does not already have the calculator so the accountant will likely keep one there to use at home.\n10.

Choice A is not a logical option either. Being married to your sister is not a realistic scenario. Therefore, we can skip those choices.\n5. Choice E: lawyer is a person who can file for divorce for you, but it's not necessarily someone who could tell you the relationship status you want to end.\n6.

Therefore, the brother could be put in a cemetery and buried. However, this action would have to be done by the brother's family members.\n5) Therefore, the final answer is A, holding a shovel and burying his pet, he is likely burying his dog, since this is the most likely outcome of a person holding a shovel in a cemetery.\nSo the final Answer is A: Burying his pet dog", "answer": "A: being married"}
{"idx": 113, "text": "1) The clue of the question is that \"death\" is inevitable when one is very depressed and therefore suicide, overdosing or murder are incorrect answers because death can't be predicted.\n2) Cyanide is a poison from the cyanide group of chemicals. So it can lead to death by means of cyanide poisoning. But cyanide on its own can't be the reason for death as it's not a living organism and therefore cannot lead death by itself.\n3) So when someone is depressed, it is more likely to lead to suicide rather than cyanide poisoning as the latter must be caused by a chemical/medical professional which is highly unlikely when the person is depressed.\n4) Death by depression is also called suicide.\n5) So the answer is C: sadness.\nSo the final question is C: Sadness.", "answer": "A: suicide"}

Use your nose. 2. Take a map. 3. Stop looking. 4. Smell the ground. 5. Smell everything.\nOutput: 1: A sense of smell is used by humans in order to identify and locate edible items such as food or potential threats.\n2: A map is a visual representation of geographic data, including routes, locations of points of interest, and directions.\n3: This can be deduced from the clue \"Stop looking\".\n4: Smell the ground refers to identifying food sources on the ground.\n5: This is another answer option derived from Smell everything.\n7: You can learn a lot about a place by smelling it.

This means that all of the options, 'illiterate', 'knowngable' and 'educated' are not descriptors of a person who is well-educated.\n4.) The other two options 'have enough food' and'meet expectations' fall away even further.\n5.) This leaves us with only two of the options, 'knowledgeable' and 'have a house' that could be considered relevant in the context.\n6.) If 'house' is not something that a person who is knowledgeable has, then it would be more accurate to say that this individual is 'knowledgeable' rather than someone who 'has a house'. Since 'knowledge' is more relevant to a person's overall learning ability, which makes it the most likely answer.

We can even eliminate B: suitcase because suits aren't delivered by hand.\n4) The sentence ends with \"and\". Based on this information, we can eliminate C: front door because a front door is a place you enter into a house.\n5) The choice that is left in the answer choices is A: mail box. \n6) We can exclude choice B because it's incompatible with what we mean by \"sometimes\".

{"idx": 145, "text": "1) Firstly, the question suggests the need for a choice in response to the president's decision regarding a hate attack on his country. \n2. \"To wage war\" means the same as \"fight against\" or \"wage conflicts\". This is not the context of the question where such an action could be necessary.\n3. \"To fight enemy\" means that either the president's country, or another country, would fight against a third entity (called an \"enemy\".) The situation here does not justify such a move.\n4. \"To kill\" means to end another person's life or put an end to a person's life. The president, however, cannot be expected to \"kill a person\" (the attacker) since he or she is not present, and this action is not the context of this question.\n5. The question doesn't state the attack. Was it an army invading, bombing, robbing, kidnaping, looting, or what? Also \"to attack one's country\" means to launch a military, political, or social attack on one's own country. So it doesn't look like the president took any actions \"to attack his country.\" So these choices of the answers are incorrect.\n6. \"Attacker\" is not related to the context of the attack.\n7. \"To destroy enemy\" means to eliminate an adversary to its fullest extent possible. In this question neither the question, nor the answer states that this is how the attack was dealt.\n8. Looking at the remaining choices; \"To hate attack on country\" means to start an attack by using or spreading hate. It is also related to the context, as in the context of the attack the attacker \"uses hate to attack his country with\". But this is not how it was said in the question.\n9. The only remaining choice of answer to the question is \"attack\" as in \"to go on the offense\" or \"to strike out against\". And even that wouldn't be possible to do since \"attackers\" were already attacking his country, so this answer choice does not make sense.\n10. Therefore, if the president is indeed trying to deal with the attack, there aren't any alternatives to make a choice from the given options that suit the given context.\n11.

Although the choices provided all have some relation to work or the office, two of those specifically mention watching a movie that may or may not be related to the workplace.\n4. \"Film\" could be a movie that was filmed in office, but \"Dream\" doesn't seem to have any relevance here, and the only remaining options seem to be C, and D.\n5. \"Dream\" could be used as an excuse or justification for not working, so it would be a weak suggestion for the boss to tell the person to \"stop dreaming\", which is definitely unrealistic.\n6.

A \"party\" is essentially an event in which guests gather for socializing and other entertainments.\n9. \"dancing\" at the party doesn't satisfy Jimmy's preference. \n10. \"having fun with new people\" is an unspecified activity that requires participation, and therefore can't be the action. \n11. \"Getting drunk\" indicates that the sole purpose of attending the party is to get drunk, which is highly unlikely. \n12. \"having a good time\" is the best choice here as the entire context of the sentence implies it. \nSo the final answer would be: E: have a good time.\n\nInput: The salesman offered me the sales pitch.

To be alive, a person's body needs to function properly, especially with the help of the heart. Therefore, \"shuddering\" is not a sign of living for a person. Since the phrase \"die\" is an extreme case of not living, it can also be said that \"growing older\" (as this phrase refers to aging) cannot be a sign of the death of a person. This eliminates the choices A: \"growing older\", B: \"reproducing\" and C: \"shuddering\".\n3. As the choices listed suggest, \"heart\" is a term used for both a singular person and a person's entire set of cardiovascular tissues.\n4.

Therefore \"perspiration\" is not the correct answer.\n5. As for 'palpitations', this is basically the feeling you get when your heart is pounding, for example when one is running or experiencing fear.

Therefore, the person who stays up late at the night will be a \"night owl\" if they show up late in the morning due to their late arrival at sunset, when they are hearing a rooster, which is expected from a morning person.\n5. This makes A: \"night owl\" and D: \"early riser\" the only two possible answers.\n6. As per the definition of \"early riser\", which is someone who tends to stay up late at night, D: \"early bird\" does not make sense as an answer. This eliminates the possibility of D: \"early rising\" as an answer.\n7. Similarly, since \"early riser' or \"early bird\" are the same, and A: \"night owls\" does not match the definition of \"earl bird\", C: \"larks\" or E: \"roosters\" don't make sense as answers. Therefore, A: \"night owling\" and D: \"morning person\" can be the two possible answers.\n8. Therefore the answer is A: \"night owning\" or D: \"morning persons\".\nSo the final answer are A: \"night owlers\" and D: \"mornings\".\n\nInput: It's a simple solution: she's just not the smartest, what do you say?

According to the given options, 'fairy tale' and 'castle' are the only two options.\n4. In fairy tales, they commonly use a knight.\n5. Thus, from the point above we've determined that the small knight is likely to be in a fairy tale.\n6. But a fairy tale also is likely to feature a castle in it.\n7.

Choices:  a: sleeping  b: on bed  c: on bedding  d: pile of blankets  e: on the floor\nOutput: 1.'Where could the dog be' is the logical part of the question.\n2. Since the dog is there in bed, the dog is definitely in a place that is not the same as 'bedding'.\n3. If you have the dog on the bed then there will only be'sleeping'. Dog on bedding and pile of blankets both mean the same thing.\n4. Since he is on the bed, dog will not be on the floor.\n5. Dog can't sleep on bed or sleeping.\n6.

This can be the cause of his obsession but can't fit in with the question given as it describes the past tense of an event that had occurred.\n5- The \"cleanliness\" options seem odd as most people wash their hands for cleanliness and would not cause irritation or thought as a sideeffect.\n6- Thought itself does not describe actions such as washing his hands or the irritation was caused by the action of washing hands. \n7- With this information, we must choose \"cleanliness\" as the only option that fits in with the question. \n8- Since \"cleanliness\" is always done for hygiene purposes, the \"wet towel\" cannot be an option as the purpose of the towel should be to dry the hands rather than get them wet.\n9- So our final answer is B: use soap.\nSo the final answers is B: use soap  \n\nInput: The man went to take a bath with shampoo, what was he trying to achieve?

{"idx": 333, "text": "1.\"Orthodox\" is typically used in the context of religious or spiritual beliefs and the practice of associated traditions.\n2. The word \"orthodox\" originates from the Greek word orthodoxos, meaning \"conventional\".\n3. \"Orthodox\" behaviors are generally respectful and traditional in nature. While \"heretical\" is typically associated with beliefs and doctrines that are considered to be incorrect or contrary to those held by the mainstream or established belief system.\n4. Since behavior is considered to be a reflection of one's beliefs and doctrinal choices, one is inclined to choose a word that goes with the term \"orthodox\", which is \"conventional\". The behavior referred to in this context would therefore be 'conventional'.\n5. 'Liberal' is not the answer as it isn't a common word used to describe behavior or actions.\n6. \"Recalcitrant\" comes quite near to 'conventional'. However, \"recalcitrant\" and \"conventional\" aren't the same - one indicates defiance, whereas the other simply reflects a normal behavior or mindset.\n7. 'Conservadox' has been given to us as the answer for the last option. \"Conservadox\" is a term describing a person or group exhibiting both conservative and liberal viewpoints or values. But 'Conservadox', though it fits the criteria of the last option, doesn't describe behavior.\n8.

They denote the action one will most likely have to use in order to put the carpet into the drier machine. Pull/Put/Lift/Slide stands out as the relevant options to the text, from the given options. Only option,'stack' does not go with the text. As per the text, the carpet is already lying around and it is going to be placed in the drier machine after that it will go through a series of actions including washed, rinsed, and dried.\nNow, looking at the given options, it is most apparent that you take an action related to the movement of the carpet within the given room.

From this, it can be inferred that they would continue what they had started the previous night.\n5.

'Enjoyable' may seem to have the right connotation, but given the context, it does not fit the statement exactly. \n7. If the 'rowdy frat guys' had a fun time the night before, they might expect another such fun event tonight. \n8.

{"idx": 397, "text": "1. The first step is to identify what the term \"Tardis\" means.\n2. \"Tardis\" is a fictional object that appears in the Doctor Who franchise - a British science fiction series.\n3. It's essentially an extraterrestrial vehicle, whose appearance resembles a small old blue British police box, which acts as a time machine and spacecraft that allows time travel between planets and universes.\n4. Moving on to the question, it specifically refers to the \"master control\". \n5. In layperson's terms, it simply means the control mechanism that regulates one mechanism or another. \n6. In the case of Tardis, it must act as an on-off control and that too for time traveling, hence, can be thought of as the \"mains power\" for time traveling equipment. \n7. \"Nuclear power plant\" is also included out of the context, as the power source for Tardis might be nuclear energy or not.\n8. However, nuclear power plants can't generally operate or control time and so the answer is excluded.\n9. \"Center\" is also incorrect for the same reason.\n10. \"Basement\" is a place for storage and not control. \n11. \"Main office\" again is incorrect.\n12. This leaves us with \"bowel\" or \"stomach\" as an organ that houses and controls many things simultaneously, and so, \"bowel of the ship\" can be a good answer. \n13. The only problem left is the wording - is \"bowel\" or is it \"ship\"? Both answers are plausible.\n14.

Choices: 1: Arrest them 2: Keep it a secret 3: Cut off contact 4: Place around your house 5: Give you work\nOutput: 1: Arbitrarily selecting someone for house arrest is not only illegal, but also highly immoral.\n2: Secrecy is not inherent to the context. Also, the statement is too vague: \"give you work...and place it around your house\", as well as the choices \"give you work\" and \"place it around your house\". \"Giving you work\" also does not seem to relate to isolating someone. \n3: Cutting someone off from all contact is extreme and cruel. The statement doesn't require a physical action, but a decision not to talk to someone.\n4: Putting someone in house-arrest implies they are confined to their own home, which cannot be done to someone if they work outside.\n5: The words \"give you work and place it around your house\" do not make sense in this context. This is a sentence structure that does not follow the general rules of grammar.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1: Arrest.\n\nInput: What does the woman want to get if she got the job?

{"idx": 441, "text": "1.'Clearing scene' here involves taking any obstacles so that the traffic could move. \n2. Thus the actions to traffic should involve the same. \n3. The given options 'hurry along', 'direct traffic', 'help', 'force open door' and 'corner thief' do not satisfy this condition.\n4. 'Clearing space' makes 'corner thief', which is about someone'stealing someone's space' inappropriate here.\n5. Of the three options left, 'direct traffic' and 'help' do not involve 'clearing or removing', which is necessary in the question's context.\n6.

Choices:  A : the day's end  B:the beginning of day C:the end of the day D-the middle of the day E:the night time\nOutput: The question asked where to start your vehicle. \n1. Based on the clue in the question, we can understand that the answer is most likely the location of the gas station - for example, we use gas stations to start our cars or other vehicles, especially in the evening/at the end of the day because it's darker and easier to spot a place to start.\n2. However, the other options are valid at different times of the day but are irrelevant to the task of starting vehicles on time.\n3. If the question wording was more specific and asked for the \"best time to start your car at a gas station,\" only the first choice (choice A as \"the end of the day\") would be the right answer.\n4. However, in this context, \"the end of the evening\" is a bit unclear since we can still consider \"the beginning of the evening\" as \"the end of a day\" for some people.\n5. Also, \"the middle of the day\" isn't quite an accurate answer since \"the middle of the night\" does not provide specific details about nighttime periods. \n6. So, based on these considerations, choice D \"Night time\" is the most relevant answer for this question.\nSo the final answers will be D: Nighttime.\n\nInput: To find out what the", "answer": "A: hurry along"}

Since the amount being questioned is a \"fit\" into a purse, it's unlikely to be $9. \n4. Therefore, we can rule off choice A: $9.\n5. Choice B: $90 will not \"fit\" in a purse in 2021 since the number of years between the two dates are also 90 in value. This answer is hence ruled off.\n6.

{"idx": 457, "text": "1-2. The problem can be analyzed by identifying the \"color yellow\" and \"the opposite of the characteristic.\" \n3. These two things might appear incongruent but they do connect when we look at the options given, which are colorless, fearless, english carrier, courageous, and brave.\n4. If these options all had the opposite of \"the characteristic\", the \"colors yellow\" would be \"opposite of all the colors\" which aren't possible, and not merely opposite colors.\n5. This confirms that the word \"opposite of the characteristic\", in the problem, refers to the opposite of any of the colors of yellow.\n6. So in order to find the opposite of the yellow color, it is best to take a look at the given terms and match them with the color yellow.\n7. The \"color yellow\" is best matched with the term \"brave\", which is a term with a similar meaning to \"courage\" and \"english carrier.\"\n8. Thus, \"brave\" is the \"opposite of color yellow.\"\n9. The remaining options are colorless, brave, fearless, and courageous.\n10. One should note that \"brave\" is already an option given, so this leaves us with colorless, fearless and courageous.\n\n11. Colorless is eliminated because if \"brave\" is colorless, the other options must only be of colors, which is contradictory to the problem. \n12. Fearless is also eliminated because if the opposite of yellow is brave, then colorless must be the opposite of the color yellow.\n13. Courageous is also eliminated because \"yellow\" indicates \"courageous.\"\n14. Therefore only option \"courageous\" is left because if brave can be the opposite of color yellow, then colorless can only be the opposite of the colored yellow.\n15. Therefore, the opposite of yellow is courageous.\nSo the final answers is B: english carries\n\nInput: I'll be a bit late to lunch, what am I going to?

Choices: 1. A: refrigerator shelf B: table shelf C: kitchen shelf D: wine cellar E: butler's pantry\nOutput: The answer can be determined by defining what kind of shelf would not only contain food but also wine, and then eliminating the unsuitable options. For example, a refrigerator shelve probably wouldnt be the best choice because it usually stores food and possibly beverages such as juices, sodas, or milk. A wine cellar, which is similar to a refrigerator or cabinet in some ways, would be too specific of an option. A table shelf might not be a good choice because there are so many types of tables that could have a table shelf, and a person could store food and wine on the shelf of a different type of table. A wine cellar would likely not be the most appropriate choice since it deals primarily with wine and might not be the most versatile option. In addition to these unsuitable options, the butler's panty might not be the best choice because while it could feasibly display both food and wine, it would require an employee, such as a butler, rather than a family member to organize and store the food and wine in a manner consistent with that type of space. Therefore, the best choice would be a kitchen shelf because it is the most versatile shelf, and families often use them to display dishes, which could include food items, and can also potentially be used to store wine bottles, although this would likely not be its primary function. \n\nInput: What do you call a woman who can talk about almost anything?

D: Cats frequently have the habit of annoying their owners with their playful behavior, as per the phrasing of the question, \"What happens to cats..?\".\n5.

The question asks about the part of the body that is affected by dry and cracked heels, the \"feet\", thus eliminating 'boot' (on the foot) and 'dry', indicating a state, not an action.\n4. Although the word \"Loaf\" is related to food, it has an entirely different meaning. Also, 'cracked' feet doesn't necessarily imply that there will be a 'hock' on the foot.\n5. \"Hock\" is an archaic term used to refer to someone's foot. Choice 'D' is irrelevant because the heel of the foot is not 'Bread'.\n6. Similarly, choice 'E' is irrelevant because cracks of the skin can occur anywhere - on the foot or not.

Thus, they are all suitable options for this question.\n2) To narrow down an answer, one must consider how likely other shapes are to cut through other objects (ie sharpness). The \"star\" (Option E) would need to be at a higher angle to cut through another object, which would add more pressure to the objects that the \"star\" is likely to cut through (which would result in more damage to both the \"star\" object and the object it is cutting).\n3) We can, therefore, deduce that the \"star\" (option E) is probably not a good fit as this kind of object. Similarly, there is some potential damage to consider when using a \"triangle\" (option D) or \"diamond\" (option B). However, none of these damage implications are considered to be severe, and the \"diamond\" and \"triangle\" are the most likely objects that people would use to cut through other objects.\n4) Since the question does not specify the kind of object that would be used to cut through objects, the choice we can be most sure of is option D: \"triangle\".\nSo the final answer will be D: triangle.\n\nInput: A very popular game that's played indoors is the Choices: A: volleyball B: baseball C: soccer D: badminton\nOutput: Here, the answer depends on the player's skill, not the game, so the question actually seems to be asking about which skill would you use to get rid of a mosquito?\n1.

There is no specific place or \"home\" a wild monkey lives in, and a home is usually associated with a person, who is a human.\n5. Wild monkeys are found in rain forests, not \"rain forests\" or \"rain storms\", or anywhere you will get wet.\n6. Therefore, if a monkey is \"taken away from their home\", \"home\" could imply a place where humans live, but is not always the case. \n7. Looking at the possible choices, a \"research laboratory\" (choice B) is not a probable place to bring a monkey to, because in most cases laboratories do not deal with live animals but instead with samples and test subjects.\n8. A \"cage\" (choice C) is also not very likely, because a cage is essentially a small and enclosed structure where an animal is made to live. \n9. \"Treetops\" (choice D) is an uncommon setting to take a monkey to, unless they are being brought for testing of some kind. \n10.

'Personal relationship': people traditionally get information from a book, a guide, television or some other source, not from their own lives, so we can eliminate \"guide\", \"television\" and \"book\" as incorrect answers. So, the answers must have something to do with the past, so we can also eliminate \"newspaper\" as the answer.\n3.) If we can only choose between \"book\" and \"newspaper\", the question would state \"traditionally\", rather than the less commonly used \"traditionally get information.\"\n4.) If instead it said \"...where people traditionally get information ABOUT...\", none of the given items would really make sense, as these would all be sources of information on a particular subject. (Think: \"Information about the weather is found in...\" and you'll understand what I mean.)\n5.)

They are not \"on\" a book because it isn't something that needs heat.\n\n6) A heat lamp is an electric light that you can turn on to keep your cat or dog warm. This doesn't apply to lizards. Heat lamps can give you sunburn, as they produce heat, but lizards can take heat from the sun, they only need the UV light; they will get too hot from exposure to the light.\n\n7) \"on rocks\" in the answer can be confusing as there is the definite article \"the\". But this is referring to the same set of lizards as in the question, which do not have to be \"on\" rocks to regulate their body temperatures, but this is what they prefer.

Choice 5 can be eliminated as it is not possible to jump 0.56 meters. Similarly, choice 2 can also be eliminated since it implies a \"typical\" jump of 0.5m.\n6, which is 6 units, can be eliminated as the highest possible limit is 5.

This suggests that either George hid the gift, the gift was ruined, or George intentionally ruined the surprise (e.g., by giving a gift that's not expected). It is, therefore, incorrect to say that in hiding a gift George ruined the surprise (since there is no certainty the gift was intended to be a gift).\n4- Option B: The statement suggests that the gift wasn't the desired gift, which indicates that George would've given the gift anyway (even when it was clearly not expected). But this doesn't imply that George ruined the surprise since it doesn't indicate that he did so intentionally.\n5- Option C: The question states that George ruined the \"surprise\" and gives the option of hiding the gift, which is the opposite of what the statement seems to imply.\n6- Option D: The statement suggests that George knows the gift better than the recipient or the surprise. Therefore, the statement is most likely true because that would imply that George was aware of what he was given beforehand. This doesn't imply that option E is incorrect either, since the other options aren't mutually exclusive.\n7- So, option B is incorrect and option E is not relevant since all other options are mutually exclusive.

{"idx": 665, "text": "1: The question refers to compassionate thoughtful as a characteristic of a person. It can, therefore, be described in relation to personality traits.\n2. The options given for descriptions are - 'disengenious', 'human', 'weird', 'kind', and'stupid'.\n3. Compassionate thoughtfulness is usually considered to be a positive quality.'stupid' wouldn't be a good option as it doesn't seem fit with the context of the question. \n4. If personality traits are considered, 'humane', is also an option. However, humans are not animals and are not the basis for which compassion can be described.\n5. One would not generally describe 'weirdness' as a personality trait because it doesn't fit as well in a context like this, since the idea is to describe the personality trait of the 'compassionate thoughtful'.\n6. 'kind' can be used to describe thoughtfulness as a personality trait, as it can be considered as a nice quality.\n7. However, the description that seems to fit the answer the most is 'human'. 'Human' can mean 'human nature' and 'human beings'. Both of these aspects are what the answers are trying to convey.\n8. 'Human nature' is that feeling of thoughtfulness and compassion towards people and not to harm or cause them harm. Since humans can have feelings, being thoughtful and compassionate can be described as their nature.\n9. 'Human beings' refers to humanity and humanness in general. As described earlier, it can also be considered as a personality trait.\n10. So the possible answer to this could be either 'human' or 'human nature' as the description.\n\nInput: It will probably be a good nights sleep for her as she was what before bed?

If someone is eating food, and attempting to speak at the same time, it would not be possible to use their mouth to eat in the same manner due to constraints of physical space in the mouth.\n4.

{"idx": 789, "text": "The question is asking if it is true or false that waterfalls in general cover approximately 1/3 of what is covered by the ocean in aggregate.\n1. It is correct to say that approximately 1/3 (or 33.3%) of the surface of the ocean (approximately 70%) is covered by waterfalls, at least in the aggregate by any given geographical location.\n2. A waterfall is a vertical drop in the course of a river - it has a top and a bottom, with both sides made of rock.\n3. The water falls from the top, and it hits the rocks on its way down to the bottom.\n4. Since they are at two different points in a river, waterfalls are not part of \"the earth surface\".\n5. Waterfalls can be on top of a cliff - at the edge of the cliff and the waterfall drops to the valley below. Thus, since there is no valley in space and an entire cliff is not covered in water, waterfalls cannot cover 1/3 of the surface of the earth.\n6. Moreover, rivers flow around obstacles - like islands - and thus they can come from a beach, instead of coming directly from the top and bottom of a cliff.\n7. So, waterfalls cover approximately 33.3% of about 1/3 of surface ocean water, not 70%.\n8. Therefore, waterfalls do not cover 1/3 what is covered by the oceans, and the correct answer is D: surface of earth.\nSo the final statement is B: false\n\n## Test #4:\n\nNote that there is an extra test at the end that will check how well you understand what you've learned from this tutorial.\n\nInput: What are the names of the three major systems the human body's physical structure is made of?

Butcher shop or auto repair shop involve something mechanical, like a \"mechanism\". You wouldn't buy treats for kiddos, to them.\n5) Post offices might possibly sell \"treats\" but would that fall under the category of \"over a counter\"? It is possible only in very rare cases.\n6) You can also just buy treats by \"visiting\" a kid and giving them some as gifts. It would not necessarily mean buying these treats by visiting some shop that is available over counters. \n7) The answer to this is C: kitchen. \nSo the final answer  is C: kitchen\n\n\n\nInput: Your husband is an important source of support, right? Choices: 1. A: always yes 2. B: no 3. C: yes sometimes 4. D: no always 5. E: yes always\nOutput: 1.) Always and yes are in fact, very different terms.\n2.) Yes sometimes and yes always are also very different terms.\n3.) Of the choices available, the term that matches \"yes sometimes\" is probably choice (4) yes always.\n4.) The term that matches up with (1) always would be choice (5) yes always.\n5.) It's possible that the wording of choices (1) and (3) could be switched due to the grammatical structure, however they can be eliminated, as they're logically inaccurate. \nThis leaves us with choice (4) yes and (5) always, which are the only two choices remaining.\n\nSo the final answer", "answer": "A: candy store"}
{"idx": 813, "text": "Firstly, to determine the answer for this question, we need to understand the context of the question and the clues present in the options available in this question.\nStep 1: Firstly, the question uses the word \"which\" in its opening statement, implying that it is referring to place, and not object. Therefore, we can rule out A: \"house\", B: \"hotel\", and E: \"dorm\" as options.\nStep 2. When the question asks for a laundry room, it isn't clearly mentioning if it will be present on the grounds or inside the building. \nStep 3: Hence, we must narrow our options to C: Greenhouse and D: college here, as other options could potentially be places that only staff can access, like A: \"greenhouse\" and D: \"school\".\nStep 4: Further, the question refers to a staff-only laundry room in the greenhouse and college, but it isn't clear about which of these two options the given answer would belong to.\nStep 5. In other words, the only thing we know about what the question is trying to state is that it has to be an indoor space, as it is being referred to as a \"room\" instead of a \"building\" like hotel or apartment, which could be outdoor spaces.\nStep 6. Now among the two remaining options, college is a building, while greenhouse can be either an indoor space containing plants or be a room in a greenhouse.\nStep 7. Now we can rule out D: College, as greenhouse and college could be used interchangeably, i.e., college could also be referred to as a greenhouse.\n8. Therefore there is a 50% chance that the answer belongs to any of the two remaining options, that is, A: House and B: Hotel, of which only A: House, can be an indoor staff-only space, because B: Hotel could be an outdoor one. \nStep 9: Thus, it is more likely that the answer is A: House.\nSo the final question's answer is A: house\n\nInput: Why didn't he finish the puzzle?

{"idx": 821, "text": "1) In this question, the answer that would fit into the context is \"C\" (Freezer).\n2) First, We should consider the words from the context itself.\n3. \"Grocery store\" is a shop or store which sells food & other household supplies.\n4. \"Plate\" is normally used to place food.\n5. \"Cabbage\" is a vegetable that needs to be stored.\n6) So, the first two questions we should answer are \"Where are you? Does that place have groceries stores?\" The answer from context is \"Yes\".\n7) Now, the next question is \"What item is your problem?\", the answer to this question is \"cabbage\".\n8) Finally, \"What store would you want to put it in?\", the answer to the question is \"Freezer\". \nSo, the final answer is C) Freezer\n\nInput: What will be used to decorate the Christmas tree?

Moreover, John felt guilty after breaking the window because window is a thing in his eyes.\n2. Looking at all the options, the only thing that wasn't broken was the classroom and the person, John. \n3. Therefore, if John broke the window, he may have damaged the classroom. This indicates the plausible answer is option 'A: friend's house'.

{"idx": 829, "text": "- 1. In this context, one may infer the meaning of the phrase \"wave flares\" from the general definition of \"flairs\" as a warning or signal of the intentions of law enforcers.\n- 2. According to the given choices, \"book robber\", \"word with driver\" are irrelevant. \n- 3. A \"flares\" is a signal for the cars to stop, thus it is logical to assume that one of the options is related to car accidents or something similar.\n- 4. Choice D, \"traffic direct\" is the only option which relates to car accidents. Traffic directed indicates that the traffic is directed, or that traffic is not supposed to stop at the traffic light.\n- 5. If the police waves at cars, that signifies traffic will stop but \"directed traffic\" does not fit in this context.\n- 6. So what remains is Choice B, \"believe guilty\". As per the general dictionary, \"wave\" means to move one's hand or arm, so the choice B \"believe guilty\" seems plausible.\nSo the final guess answer is B: believe guilty.\n\nInput: What causes people to talk?

{"idx": 833, "text": "1: The word \"convicted\" in the phrase implies a positive outcome.\n2. This points towards \"pass sentence\". But the question gives an answer for a positive outcome, i.e., \"does a judge do...\", it can be assumed that convicted means a positive outcome.\n3. This leaves us with \"bring in verdict\" which means to come to an official decision or conclusion.\n4. Similarly, \"bring in ver\u200bdict\" is also another variant of \"pass sentence\".\n5. In addition to that, \"serve justice\" means to give a punishment, which would mean the final outcome and not necessarily the act.\n6. The sentence is therefore \"What does a judge do to convicted when he passes sentence?\". \n7. A judge passes a sentence and hence the answer is B: arrest.\nSo the final sentence is B: arrest\n\nInput: What was the young lady trying to do to her homework?

Looking at the other options, complete and finish seem to imply the completion of a task, thus meaning that the task would be done.\nStep 5. Similarly, get and start seem to only indicate attempting to initiate the task and don't imply completion in the task, i.e., the task would not be complete but completed (only initiated).\nStep 6. Now let's look at grade or start which seem to indicate that it could only be grade.\nStep 7. Therefore, the Young lady was trying to Grade her homework. \nSo the final sentence answer is B: grade\n\nInput: Where the person who took toilet snake to stay with them?

{"idx": 837, "text": "1.\\ Why humans do certain activities when their legs are tired:\n2. Legs can get tired, especially if one spends a lot of time walking or standing for a long period.\n3. Tired legs may cause a person to:\n      - Sit down, especially to rest their tired legs\n      - Have sex, maybe for a break from walking or standing constantly while not making mistakes\n      - Reproduce babies, to continue their bloodline\n4. The given answer choices are \\strong{\\em{B: make mistakes}}, \\strong{\\em{D: reproduce}} and \\strong{\\em{E: excrete}}.\n5. But none of them seems to be associated with tired legs.\n6. 'Make mistakes' is a term used for activities that don't involve a particular person but is usually applied to the actions of machines. Hence, this is unlikely.\n7. 'Reproduce' refers to the human body, or nature to some extent, which further indicates that this answer is unlikely.\n8. 'Excrete' means to release solid or liquid waste from the body, which has nothing to do with tiredness or legs. Hence, it's also not likely.\n9. Hence the best explanation for the given choices is that humans do \\strong{\\em{C: have sex}} when their legs are tired.\nSo the final answers is C: have sex\n\nInput: What did she call when her daughter started to fall asleep?

{"idx": 841, "text": "1: 1. There are many places where disease can be spread. Some of the places include schools, prisons, beaches, forests, etc.\n2. However, the question indicates where \"disease often spread\" may not \"shouldn't\" be. This indicates that there may be some places, where disease can spread or be spread where they \"shouldn't be\".\n3. For instance, you shouldn't have a ghost town spreading disease because there aren't any living entities to help stop the disease from moving to other healthy people. Additionally, \"third world country\" isn't a place that should spread disease because such places are typically under-developed and have poor or limited resources to handle diseases, making them more vulnerable to disease outbreaks.\n4. Looking at other options, \"human body\" could be a place where diseases can be spread, as the human body is the site of many biological processes, which can result in disease transmission, but \"rug\" would be highly unlikely as a place to spread disease as it is a non-living object that is unlikely to carry or spread bacteria or other disease-causing agents.\n5. Finally, looking at the remaining options, \"hospital\", the place where the sick go to treat their ailments, can be seen as a place where diseases \"shouldn't\", or at least shouldn't be expected to, spread. \n6.

Snakes are known to inhabit a variety of environments, but the troposphere is generally not one of those environments.\n3. \"Wyoming\" refers to a state in the United States. There are also other states in the United States that also have abundant snake species. \n4. Therefore, we can exclude this option.\n5. Bushes is not an unreasonable location for snakes. Most snakes prefer to live in warm and humid areas with ample hiding places and food sources. Therefore, a bushy area could be a potential answer.\n6. However, some snakes may also reside in deserts and other dry areas. \n7. \"Nightmare\" and \"feild\" are not natural environments that snakes are likely to reside in.\n8.

The question doesn't specify the style of music which explains why the answer may or may not include band or brass, which are more common in jazz and rock styles of music.\n4. A symphony orchestra is an orchestra consisting of a large number of string, brass, and woodwind players playing instruments at the same time.\n5. A string quartet is a musical ensemble of four stringed musical instruments such as violins, violas, and cellos, commonly used in classical music.\n6. A violin is classically used in an orchestra and is therefore not required here. \n7. A symphony is a large musical structure, such as a piece composed for orchestra which can be heard in concerts and may include brass and percussion in live performances, so band can also be heard in symphony concerts.\n8. Therefore in summary, the environment of a \"viola\" should be an orchestra.\n9. Therefore A can be eliminated as the answer. \n10. Further, symphony orchestra is the most common option among the given list, and does not specify a particular type or style of music, so B, C, D, E can also be eliminated.\n11.

Grapes can, in fact, be served whole in a dinner setting, making \"use a fruit cocktail\" an incorrect answer.\n4. Grapes can also be served whole in a bottle as wine, making \"use grapes in wine press\" an incorrect answer. Additionally, there's a clear mismatch between these two options, as wine press is used to convert grapes to wine.\n5. Grape juice is commonly associated with juice drinks, making \"use a juice press\" an incorrect answer as well.\n6. This means that there's a clear overlap between \"use grapes for cocktail\" and \"use grapes to make wine\".\n7. So, we can either select \"use grapes with a wine press\" or \"use grapes as cocktail\" as an answer.\n8. \"Grapes with a winepress\" is the most logical answer as this option uses grapes to create wine, a cooked dish, and as a drink. \n9.

{"idx": 873, "text": "1: The question consists of two parts, the first part is the answer and the second question defines the answer.\n2. We have to locate the answer based on the mentioned scenario.\n3. The scenario clearly states that \"What has been highly criticized?\" In response to this, the answer that has been given is the \"security\" that has been criticized.\n4. To answer the second part of the question, we would need to identify what the option in contrast to \"security\" is.\n5. Here the options are; \"university\", \"concert\", \"home\", \"terminal\", and \"airport\".\n6. Among all the given options, the one, which is highly criticized, is \"terminal\"\n7. Therefore, we can deduce that the answer is E: airport.\nSo the final answers are D: airport\n\nInput: Which company got taken over, which was the new owner? Choices:  i.e. Apple ii.e. Twitter A: Microsoft B: Yahoo  C: Amazon D: Google\nOutput: 1) The question has two parts, \"Which company got taken over\" and \"Which was the new owner\"?\n2) \"i.e\"(latin for 'that is') and \"e.g\"(latin for \"for example\"; abbreviation of exempli gratia), are in this context, used to explain how to identify the company (the first part) and the new owner (the second part).\n3) \"Yahoo\" is not mentioned, so we can exclude it as an answer from the options.\n4) We also exclude \"Amazon\" from the options as the company got taken over but that didn't identify the new owner.\n5) The company that was taken over was \"Twitter\", therefore, the new owner is \"Elon Musk\".\n6) \"Microsoft\" was the company that \"got taken over\", by \"Apple\".\n7) The company that was \"taken over\" by \"Apple\" is \"Twitter\".\n8) So the answer is \"Elon Mus.\"\n\nInput: How does a farmer grow crops for animals to eat?

{"idx": 877, "text": "1..The first clue is that the person is putting on make up. Someone who wants compliments is not going to put on make up of this type. \n2. A normal result of being complimented is that one feels good. But if we consider the rest of the options, those who are likely looking for compliments don't have any goal of receiving pleasure or joy.\n3. The person isn't wearing lipstick or eyeshadow for fun and neither are they doing it for interesting experiences or joy.\n4. Even if the person is looking to receive compliments, we cannot infer that they are expecting compliments that will make them happy as opposed to interesting experiences which have similar or better connotations. \n5. Thus, the answer is B, look attractive.\nSo the final conclusion is: B: look attractive\n\nInput:She ate some of the food, what did you get when you bought it? Choices: 1)A.

The action given of her eating it is the action of consumption, which is inversely related to the action of buying.\n2.) The only answer choice left remaining is buying, buying is the only action given in this context that we can't use in the second sentence.\n3.) From this statement we can make a conclusion that \"buying\" is related to \"eating\" in the second part of the statement. In other words, the answer to the first part of the question is buying, in the second part, when you buy food, then you also eat it.\n4.) From the statement: \"enjoyment and satisfaction, enjoyable, enjoy", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

Choices: A: inside B: outside C: den D: bed E: warehouse\nOutput: 1- The first thing to do is determine what kind of house a dog lives in. Based on the context, it is unlikely that a dog lives in a warehouse or bed.\n2- Similarly, a dog does not live in a den as it is a den for animals rather than a place to live in.\n3- Similarly, a dog also does not live in a place labeled \"outside\".\n4- Finally, a dog lives inside a house and option \"A\" is the most appropriate option.\nSo the final choice is A: inside.\n\nInput: If on a bus, what would an individual be looking for, something to eat, or a phone? Choices: \t\nA: phone B: bus station\nC: food D: blanket E: sleep\nOutput: Step 4: If choosing on a bus then the options become a bit more limited since the bus does not have the bus station or bus station's items; furthermore, a bus does not have the items mentioned in the choices, including blanket and sleep, since a blanket is for sleeping in and sleeping takes time, whereas a phone, food, and a bus station are items which can be found on the bus. Step 5: Looking at the remaining options, it seems that a \"phone\" is the most probable option since the person would not like to be \"sleeping\" on the bus nor a \"blanket\"", "answer": "D: farm yard"}
{"idx": 885, "text": "1 The question asked about the possible places to keep a clipboard.\n2. It's important to notice that we are asked about 'a clipboard' instead of 'the clipboard', so the person is asking where to keep a clipboard generally, not specifically the clipboard they asked about in question. \n3. All of the options could be a possible place where to keep a clipbaord.\n4. All are common places where people can have and keep various different kinds of clipboards. As a result, any of the options could be possible answers.\n5. Looking at the options given, only Choice B, \"place of work\" is a more specific place than others, in that, it pertains to a place where someone could have a clipboard. \n6.

What kind of furniture was it? Choices: A: couch B: bed C: bedroom D: table E: closet \nOutput: 1 We are asked to give an answer for what \"kind of furniture\" a certain bed was, given some information about beds being stacked and one of them removed from the group.\n2. We know that beds, in general, are types of furniture. \n3. Some of the options also include beds as furniture, while others do not. \n4. The first question we should ask is: \"What was taken away from the pile of beds?\" \n5. From the options given, the answer would be C: bedroom. \n6. \"The beds were placed against each other, then one was taken\", we infer that most likely the removed \"bed\" was a'single bed', one of the beds in the pile where placed against other beds forming a stack of them. \n7. One of those beds was taken away, leading the other beds to fall, and the bedroom to become an empty space among the other beds. \n8. So, the furniture that was taken away would have been a \"bedroom\" since it is the room in which beds are commonly found.\n9. Therefore the answer is C: bedroom", "answer": "C: desk"}

So he is trying to know if it is just ringing or has rung.\n3) If he is concerned about a future event, the options are will ring and rings.\n4) The options which are incorrect are B: was ringing (It is wrong because if the phone is working, it won't ring) and D: rings ( It is wrong because if the man asked if it has rung, the person he is talking to would not answer the phone).

{"idx": 909, "text": "1.\"Get shape\" can mean losing excess weight or toning up, while \"juice bar\" refers to a place where juices are sold or consumed. \n2. \"Juice bar\" would usually be a place where you can get something to drink, and therefore, this does not necessarily mean that you have to drink in order to go there or visit. \n3. This means that you can get in shape while also having a drink at a juice-bar or juice-bar type place, in this case, fridge. \n4. \"Gym\" and \"refrigerator\" are too basic to fit as answers due to the provided context. \n5. You can get in shape or \"get shaped\" through certain exercises, or \"regimes\" which include, among other things, running, cardio exercising, or swimming. \n6.

{"idx": 913, "text": "1). The question is a type of analogy, where knowledge of the meaning of the word \"odds\" is essential.\n\t2). Word \"odd\" is in the title, indicating \"odds\" in the question might refer to the number of animals, and not their personality traits, age or background.\n3). It can therefore be interpreted that the zookeepers chose a number of koala that was out of the ordinary (odd), and put it in the place (p-panda) where it was unexpected.\n4). The question's title itself indicates that the zookeepers were not consistent and applied their selection to an animal (koala) that does not belong there.\n5). Hence, the zookeepers were behaving in a manner that is contrary to their policy (O-odd).\n6). The only answer option that does not seem to match the requirement of the zookeepers' behavior is C (aus-Australian), as Australia is not near China. The rest of the options, thus, can be eliminated. \n7). The only remaining answer option that would indicate an odd behavior by the zookeepers would be choice A - jungle. \n8). This option states that the zookeepers made an odd choice, which indicates that their behavior with the koala was not typical or common.\n9). This behavior, therefore, can logically mean that the zookeepers displayed the koala in an improper manner, instead of displaying it in the habitat (B-bamboo)\n10). The option E (child-book) is eliminated because the zookeepers are presumed to be highly experienced and the word \"book\" does not correspond to their professions. \n11). The remaining answer options are either animals that live in a jungle habitat, or the food they feed on. The zookeepers do not feed their animals on bamboo and no other food option can be attributed to the behavior of the zookeepers, which narrows the options down to either bamboo or jungle.\n12). The \"bamboo grove\" is a type of tropical jungle and would be an acceptable display location.\n13). This brings us to the final answer, B: Bamboo grove.", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}
{"idx": 917, "text": "1) Since the apple tree is being used to describe an object, the apple tree will most likely be mentioned in a narrative or some form of story.\n2) The phrase \"apples of gold in a sack of silver\" is a popular idiom describing \"exceptional quality\".\n3) So this must be something valuable since it's \"forbidden\" to others; \"Forbidden\" indicating it's not allowed to be accessed.\n4) Looking at the options, The phrase \"great outdoors\" is a nonsense phrase as its use in the context is not apt. \n5) Thus, all the options that pertain to \"garden of eden\" are ruled out.\n6) The phrase \"appearance in washington state\" can also be ruled out since this phrase would mean the item would appear in the listed location as opposed to the context of the question which specifies it is already there.\n7) Thus, the phrase \"apple tree in a garden of eden\" is a phrase that has to be understood in terms of the phrase \"apples of silver in a sack of gold\". \n8) This phrase when used in the context of the question means that \"apples of silver\" are being placed in a \"sack of gold\" which happens to be the Garden of Eden.\n9) Therefore, the answer is A: North Carolina.\nSo the final question is A: North Carolina\n\nInput: Where can you find a small wooden pigeon?

'Toy store' is not where he should not leave things as it is a store where he buys some of his toys. He won't be buying a toy for which his mother would yell at him.\n5. Looking at the other options, 'Hall' is a place where ceremonies or formal gatherings take place. The question is not about where Billy shouldn't leave his belongings for formal occasions.\n6. In the same way, Billy's mother would not be yelling at him if he leaves her belongings in the 'bathroom'.\n7. If Billy leaves his belongings in the 'amusement park', that is an unsuitable place, as he might want to play there.\n8. Lastly, 'fair grounds' refers to the place where the fair or carnival takes place. While Billy might want to play here too, his mother could still yell at him. So, his mother wouldn't want him to leave his things in this place either.\n9.

Let us go through each option in relation to \"loss\" or \"heat\" to eliminate the incorrect options. 2) Loss of heat would be more relevant to option A: \"loss of heat\" but this is excluded as well after considering option B: \"expansion\" which would occur in the event and is not negative to James state of being. 3) \"Revenge\" is not a negative event and would be more associated with option A: \"loss\" which would cause negative results for James. Hence, we can eliminate option C: \"revenge\". 4) This leaves options D \"relaxation\" and E \"calm down\". Both words are related to the effect of cooling and are the remaining options. But, James doesn't want to decrease his temperature which is associated with the negative event, he wants to increase heat as he is trying to reheat himself. 5) Using a combination of the given information, we can understand that James is not trying to stop heat losing which is related to his relaxed state. He is trying to cool down quicker than he can, which is related to his desire to do the work/reheat faster. 6) Therefore, the only answer which correctly states James's current state is option E: stop the cooling, as he wants heat gain, and not heat loss. The work refers to his desire to do his job quickly, not the opposite.\nSo the final answers is E: stop the cool.\n\nInput: When we are not sick, what is our immune system doing?

Choices: \n\nA: slip on\nB: tight grip\nC: safety shoes\nD: walk carefully\nOutput: 1: The question is asked about whether or not wearing of sandals can prevent people from falling. \n2. Based on our knowledge, sandals cannot give the same support as real shoes so they cannot prevent slips and falls. \n3. Since safety shoes offer high-tops and strong metal clasps for maximum ankle support and other types of footwear are not appropriate for the context, the only remaining option is C: safety shoes.\n4. Therefore, the choice that can be eliminated is B: tight grip.\n5. Another choice that can also be eliminated is A: slip on. This is because if you are wearing sandals, you are less likely to slip and fall than with no footwear on at all.\n6. D: walk carefully can work well with sandals but may not be enough. \n7. There is no mention of falling to the floor so we cannot eliminate E: walk carefully.", "answer": "D: elderly person"}

The options given are park, make time for, receive instructions, take money, and leave work.\n4.) \"park\", in this context, is not a common phrase for something unpleasant but could potentially be an alternative interpretation for the action of \"going\" to all the dealers (as in stop at every dealer and park at each one).\n5.) Likewise, the actions of \"making time for\", \"receiving instructions\", \"taking money\", and \"leaving work\" do not match the given context.\n6.) So, the possible interpretations for the question narrow down to \"park\" and \"code\" only.\n7.) As we can see, the meaning behind \"code\" is more likely to be the correct answer because its literal meaning is different from \"park\".\n8.) To make this confirmation even stronger, it has to be noted that the drug kingpin in the question specifically \"told his man to go to all the errands\".\n9.)

If the game is misleading or deceptive - if it wasn't actually free, as implied, then the child's parents will be in for some tough decisions on the payments related to microtransactions.\n\nHere the word \"microtransactions\" is not implying \"small purchases\" (like buying a cup of coffee) but rather a misleading and deceptive action of paying full costs of playing the games - the true price for playing the game.\nSo it's incorrect that the child will be caught (in captivity), contained or contained. It's also incorrect to say that parents were doing the paying (or that they were caught or contained in payment for the game). Rather, they were doing something after having found themselves in need of spending money for playing the game.

While an alcoholic drink could be consumed in the form of a solution, it is not widely consumed in pure form. \n4) The consumption of cheese seems inconsistent with the context of the question. While it is indeed chewing food, it requires the consumption of larger quantities and over an extended period of time whereas the consumption of cheese is not mentioned as a particular oral care product. \n5) Pepper has no relation to oral health products nor does it imply any actions which would make it relevant in the context of the question\n6) Therefore, we can deduce that if the consumption of oral health products could result in a toothe ache, then it is likely that what made toot ache was consumption of sugar.\nSo the final answe is C: sugar", "answer": "D: street"}

We use these phrases to describe the 'time required to communicate' because they are generally linked to communication. \n4: One could say the time taken to communicate would be wasted. However, in context of the phrase, it isn't the 'time taken to communicate' that is wasted, its the 'time taken to complete a project' that is wasted and could be considered slowed. \n5: 'Static' essentially means 'not changing' and is an incongruous answer based on the description given.\n6: 'Train of thought' is likely to be in line with the phrase's underlying meaning, but it is more relevant to be a description of the two persons' thinking progress as opposed to a delay to their work rate.\n7: 'Progress' doesn't match the overall intent in terms of describing the progress of the project as a whole, as opposed to a specific part of work.\n8: If the progress of the project slows down, it's unlikely the time taken to speak over something to be wasted. However in the given context, 'transfer of information' is an action that requires communication that could potentially be wasted while progressing with the project. \n9: 'Collaboration' pertains to the working effort and is associated with the process of communicating to complete a project successfully, but it isn't directly in line with the phrase 'time required to communicate'. Therefore, the answer is 'transfer of information'.\nSo the final answer was C: transfer of information.", "answer": "C: progress"}

As for the answer, option E doesn't match the given information since the answer is concerned about the woman's motives for shopping, and \"spending money\" doesn't align with the given information.\n6. Option D refers to credit, which is related to the action of shopping. However, the phrase \"her credit\" makes it clear that her credit was not the motive in shopping.\n7.

Here, the answer should not be this because the dream was very real and therefore the answer cannot be \"reality\".\n6) \"imagination\" refers to the power of forming imaginary pictures in the mind. Here also the answer cannot be this since he dreamed of something so horrific. Imagination here becomes irrelevant.\n7) \"dreamworker\" refers to a person who works with dreams and helps patients remember them. Thus, we cannot discount this as the answer. \n8) \"nightmare\" is used to describe a strange and frightening night-time dream. The dream that Stanley had was in fact frightening.

Choices:  B: call friends\nOutput: 1.) They can't wait much longer and may need to make other plans in-case the process takes much longer than they thought/expected.\n2.) They can't call friends because calling friends is dependent on being connected to a telephone and some degree of distance. \n3.) The person might still have some options to contact the authorities in the case when they cannot bear much longer.\n4.) To find the right answer to this question, we need to match the answers with the clues that the puzzle provides.\n5.) \"Too Much Time\" probably means waiting for a long time and not able to control/regulate how much/long time it takes to get something done. \n6.) The only answers that have time as a part of it are waiting and a long period of time.\n7.) So, the option that makes sense here is option B: \"calling friends\" because calling friends is about timing i.e. at the right/appropriate time. \n8.) Since it's not a long period of time and we don't know what type of process they were waiting for, \"calling friends\" probably isn't the right fit here.\n9.)

Playing board games with your family can take place in any of the locations listed- home, school, and toy store/shop/shelf.\n3. These locations can be places where you can purchase board games for your family.\n4. But since none of the locations mentioned have to do with purchasing board games, we can eliminate Home, School, and Toy Shop.\n5.

Option B: polished might describe the conditioning of the wood surface to a specific degree. But still, wood is made of cells, and there is no polishing involved.\n5. Therefore the only remaining options are B: polished and option C: carved in which, polished wood does not give a unique reflection.\n6. Therefore, the answer the polishing step only, so the action is C: carved. 7.

In real life, the term \"kids\" is used to refer to children.\n3. Thereby, we can ignore all choices except \"a kid\" and \"kids\". So, consider the option which suits best for both scenarios. \n4. \"A kid\" will make more sense if the person wants a second child instead of a third. Thus, we can rule out this option.\n5. \"Kids\" is used to define group of more than one children. But, the person needs to get \"when\" they have \"more\" kids and \"when\" they have a third child. In real life, it is known as \"three kids\" but it will not make sense to choose a phrase like \"When I have three kids\" instead of having  \"When I have two kids\".\n6. Hence, we can eliminate this as well as the remaining \"larger house\" is used to refer a bigger location than the current. Thus, person having \"more kids\" may need an additional house to accommodate them. So, the person gets a large house, not a larger house.\n7. Now only \"second chances\" remains and it means that the individual has got a chance to restart a relationship or life once their first two attempts failed.\n8. This is the only choice which suits the question. So, the correct answer is D: second chances.\nSo the final ans is D: second chanc \n\nInput: What does the person do if their car breaks down?

This can be further inferred that this primary action is unique to a virus, and as such not limited only to a computer, but all humans.\n4. The choices given are: infected, reproduce, mutate, and eat food.\n5. Infected is the action of a virus to the human, in that the virus replicates itself within the human host which causes symptoms of a disease, and eventually spreads to other humans and/or devices.\n6. Reproduce can be taken to mean of the actions of a virus creating new viruses.\n7. Eat food cannot be said to be the primary action of a virus, or even an action at all.\n8. Mutate is an accurate word to describe the action of a virus when it makes a new version of itself.\n9.

You can also buy this, but you couldn't find which one? Choices: 1. A: T-shirt 2. B: wagon 3. C: clock 4. D: pillow 5. E: table\nOutput: First Step: Let's understand the possible answer combinations/options that the question implies. For example, consider the following 3 possible permutations of the 5 options, and identify 2 choices each from these combinations in a particular manner that is unique to each permutation: * Option #1: A & B. As these 2 options can be found anywhere (including a shop), therefore, such an option can only be bought as both of such things are present in the market, but not found together in the same place. * Option #2: C & D. As these 2 are things which are in possession of people, therefore, these 2 options cannot be found anywhere as they are in a location beyond the premises of the shop/store. * Option #3: E & F. Here, if E and F denotes the same thing, then it can be found in the shop, but if they denote different things, then only one of these 2 options can actually be found in the shop. Second Step: Let's now understand the logic behind each of the 5 options. \"You can\" means some ability that either a person has or some thing possesses, and so \"Wink\" and \"Shop\" can be identified as the abilities of a person or things. \"Cannot\" means something that is absent and not available in that particular place", "answer": "D: cruel"}

Similarly, option C doesn't make sense either.\n6. Option D doesn't make sense as \"love\" doesn't go with \"things\", rather it goes with another human i.e. express love.\n7. The only remaining and most sensible answer is \"sun himself\", i.e. he is lying on a beach to sun himself.\n8. If you want to get the answer and explain it, the phrase 'Sun himself' means to bask in the warmth of the sun. This is why the person is lying down on the beach.\n9.

Choices:  B: dock D: boat house A: harbour B: sea E: lake\nOutput: 1 This question is regarding where do people typically park a 'boat'.\n2. A boat dock or boat harbor is used to keep a boat when not in use.\n3. A 'boat house' and 'boat mooring', similar to the mentioned are used for storing a'motorboat' or a'sailboat'.\n4.

Fun activities involve making good memories with friends, and to achieve this, a person must fit in with the group by playing similar games and taking part in similar activities.\n2. The phrase 'playing around' also fits well, particularly with 'fun'. 'Playing around' is a casual phrase used to describe a person having fun or being silly.\n3. 'Being understood' fits well with friends, but is not appropriate for the phrase.\n4. 'Beer' is an alcoholic beverage, so it is not relevant for the context.\n5. 'Visiting friends' involves socializing, not necessarily playing.\n6. The only appropriate phrase among all is 'playing around', which is why it also matches your given answer of B: beer.\nSo the final result is B: beer\n\nInput: What are you working on if you\u2019re working on something that you\u2019re thinking about finishing quickly for a reward? Choices: 1. A: building something 2. B: creating something 3. C: designing something 4. D: buying something 5. E: making something\nOutput: 1) The clue here is: 'Think about finishing quickly for a (reward).' This statement doesn't make much sense. \n2) 'A: building something,' is a very broad statement, but there is still further consideration to be done. \n3) 'building something' may be relevant, but still it is not a complete sentence and thus excluded. 4) 'buying something' is an irrelevant outcome that is not a reward because it does not match up with the description of being finished quickly. \n5) This one is an outlier as to what the context is trying to explain.'making something' may have meaningful results, but it is still an irrelevant answer as it doesn't directly address the context.\n6) Hence, the sentence 'Think about finishing something quickly for a reward' makes sense only for 'completing something', which is the correct phrase for option E: making something.\nSo the final response is E: making something\n\nInput: Where do you need to go if you were asked to return?

The options are A: \"living\", B: \"feeling good\", C: \"hyperventilate\", D: \"look around\", and E: \"breathing deeply\".\n5. \"Look around\" is unrelated to the context of breathing.\n6. \"Feeling good\" doesn't make the person breathing deeply, but the act of breathing can make someone feel good.\n7. \"Hyperventilate\" is breathing that's faster and deeper than usual or even out of proportion, and while it can be enjoyable sometimes, the person would most likely be confused on how he would do that in a vehicle.\n8. This leaves us with options A & E, both which make the person breathe.\n9.

{"idx": 358, "text": "1: First of all this question can be interpreted as a type of rebus puzzle. 2: Now that we have identified the rebus puzzle we can focus on understanding the meaning behind the words.\n3: In order to understand the answer we have to understand the word, what is it saying about the 'fond memory of the now defunt''story book'; it is indicating that he called it the 'cow'. This would make sense only if the'memories' are in reference to the 'now defunt''storybook', which should be either the 'giraffe' or 'cow'.\n4: Now there are two possibilities: \"giraffe\" or \"cow\" both of which would be more appropriate for the word'memories' rather than'storybook'.\n5: This brings us to the logical conclusion that 'giraffe' was the mascot and that it was not a fond memory of the 'giraffe'.\n6: 'Mascot' and 'Cow' are not the best options for the 'fond memory' of the mascot. So, if the term'storybook' is in reference to the mascot and not the'story' there is nothing that makes 'giraffe' a 'fond memory' other than the fact that this is the mascot.\n7: But this still leaves 'countryside' as the only option with a strong possibility of correctness since we have already deduced that the storybook is in reference to the 'giraffe mascot'.\n8: For this reason, 'countryslide' is the answer for the question.\nSo the final answers are B: story book - C: countryside\n\nInput: Which way does it turn?

The question is trying to ask for the main reason that they can' t get their work done.

Choices A: laughter, and B: being happy are two of the most common ways to be happy;  laughter refers to joy coming from humor and happiness to feeling delighted and elated from joy. \n4.\"Glee\" and \"opera\" might be applicable in this context as they both refer to an expressive outburst of happiness or joy but are not necessarily used in the same way in normal day-to-day life, and thus cannot be the answer.\n5.

There is no reference to any type of joy or pain that would have been associated with singing, or any other activity or event in general.\n8. We are left with choices C and E. \n9.\"Glee\" and opera\" imply that Danny is in some way enjoying music or acting. Danny's action here indicates that he is having fun. But the fact that he's enjoying performing on his own, singing in front of the class, suggests he's not in any way enjoying singing in front of an audience.\n10.

Therefore, we can rule out those answers which are unrelated to breathing.\n2) The diaphragm is one of the primary muscles involved in breathing, so we can strike off choices which do not include it.\n3) This leaves us with choices A, B, C and E.\n4) Let's understand the purpose of breathing and its processes.\n5) Inhalation is the process of breathing air into the lungs and is initiated by contraction of diaphragm.\n6) Exhalation is the process by which air is exhaled from the lungs and is induced by relaxation of diaphragm and contraction of abdominal muscles.\n7) Let's compare answers A and C (lungs and diaphragm) and answer B (oxygen) and E (air).\n8) From the choice A, it is certain that both the lung and diaphragm are involved in breathing process.\n9) Similarly, oxygen is involved in the breathing process as well.\n10) But only air (and not O2 or O3) is involved in exhalation.\n11) It is clear that A, C and E are inaccurate choices.\n12) Choice B (oxygen), though a correct answer based on the breathing process, does not help us to eliminate one answer (since it is an answer to the question we are considering).\n13) Therefore, the correct answer is: Answer B [Oxygen] and answer E [Air].\nSo the final answer will be B (Oxygen) and E (Air)\n\nInput: What type of fabric should you avoid if you don't want it to stretch?

So, the choices given are \"a) Veldt, b) Ocean, c) Savannah, d) Africa, e) Jungle\", respectively.\n4) The word \"Veldt\" is typically used to refer to a grassy and treeless plateau or plains region of the central or southern part of Africa. The word \"Savannah\", on the other hand, is typically used to refer a dry grassy plain between two distinct regions of trees or bushes.\n5) Finally, the phrase \"is a lion likely to..\" gives us an indication that the best answer would be a veldt since the lion has a stronger likelihood or probability of finding its home there, rather than any of the other mentioned options.\n6) Therefore, the lion can be expected to live primarily in a veldt. \nSo the final answer to the questions is: A: veldt", "answer": "D: africa"}

It further suggests that the drink was possibly alcoholic, and cheering involved celebrating an event, indicating options A: are thirsty and B: toasting are contradictory, meaning option B is incorrect.\nStep C: The given context also indicates that the people should have been celebrating, meaning E: celebrating is the correct answer as this choice indicates that those who raised a drink also cheered.\nSo the final choice is B: toasting.\n\nInput:Their eyes are full of water, it's possible that they are what? Choices: A: smiling B: sleepy C: happy D: sad E: confused\nOutput: The given statement has two important details: that the person's eyes were full of water, \nand there was a possibility of the person being any one of the given options. \nStep 1: The only emotion that could potentially cause a face to have water-filled eyes is weeping. This implies that the person may have been crying and is therefore probably sad.\nStep 2, option A: smiling indicates a person smiling with the eye muscles pulling up the inner corner of the eye, leaving the lower part of eyes dry. Crying, which is caused by sadness, involves eye muscles contracting to form water-filled eyes at the inner and outer corners of the eyelids.\nTherefore, if someone is crying, they can't be smiling. Therefore, option A is in contradiction to the given statement.\nStep 3, option B: sleepy would imply someone with tired eyes. There is no indication in the statement that the eyes were tired.\nStep 4, option C is quite unlikely in this statement. The person may be quite happy, which may involve grinning or glee, but this choice is more aligned to the person being happy about something positive in their life, and not sad about some circumstance.\nStep 5, option E is contradictory since the statement indicates it is impossible for someone to be confused and", "answer": "E: celebrating"}

{"idx": 526, "text": "1.'He got a job' indicates that he is now a professional dancer, performing either in a TV commercial or similar promotional show or event.\n2. A 'dancing' promotion is a common promotional tactic; it allows the dancer or team of dancers to advertise a company's business or product in a costumed, professional choreography.\n3. This means that the dancer will be doing either a solo act (alone in front of an audience/camera) or joined by a group. In either case, to advertise a product or business, there will be no need to use a magazine or a page of a magazine - they can be directly addressed from a TV commercial or short presentation on stage.\n4. The dancer will also be outside, given that he will probably be given a 'location to dance in public places'.\n5. This will be done inside a store/warehouse(rather than on a bus); the job that is described is a full-time job, as a result of which the dancer may not be allowed to choose his place of work, or he may be required to find a job in every place he is assigned at, depending on the contract he accepts.\n6. An easy way to find the best answer is to find the option that does NOT fit in to the given context \u2013 'Bus' can be eliminated. Now that the question has narrowed down to having 4 possible answers, it is easier to match it with a specific answer from the given ones: 'Magazine' doesn't make sense since the dancer might advertise a business in an outdoor place; he will get a chance to use his dancing ability, but his job will be to advertise the event. 'Store' doesn't make much sense as the dancer's job is to advertise an event which will never be done in a store.\n7. 'Web Page' also doesn't make sense as this option does not appear anywhere in the given context.\n8. Therefore the best answer is 'D: Web Page'.\nSo the final answer will be D: Web Page.\n\nInput: You may not always find someone who speaks your language, so what might you do to learn some new words?

'B', 'C', and 'E' options are unlikely to cause people's legs to break or to otherwise need to be elevated because there is no evidence provided that they are broken.\n3) B does not require people to lie down with their legs elevated as it simply involves spinning a wheel.\n4) Options 'D' and 'E' are not plausible because no one with a broken leg is going to use a piano or other furniture. If they are in a hospital bed, then all they have to do is lie down, so no room for an elevated leg.\n5) So the only option remaining is A:'spinning wheel'.\nSo the final answer it A: spinning wheel\n\nInput: How did the teacher figure out that the child was not listening?

E: The student was playing with a yo yo\nOutput: 1: None of the choices given are how the teacher could have figured out that child was not listening. \n2: The answer does not specify why the student was not listening, therefore, \"receiving an honest answer\" could not necessarily be used to justify whether the student was listening or not. \n3-5: The choices given were given as examples of how the student would look when he/she is listening or not listening. \nSo the only answer that makes sense is E: The student was looking for a yo yo, thus, we can deduce that the child was not paying attention to the teacher.

We can further eliminate \"medals\" because it's unlikely that both participants would be competing for a medal - it's most likely only one of them would.\n5. \"Wins\" is too general to be chosen from a list. In a wrestling match, there is usually a winner but there are a number of possible ways for that to happen. \n6.

{"idx": 594, "text": "1 The question asks the profession of a \"speech therapist\".\n2. A speech therapist is a healthcare professional who is trained in the remediation of speech-language pathology.\n3. To accomplish this, they work with people who have had speech-related issues, such as stuttering, or lisps, to help them improve their speech and communication skills. \n4. This includes teaching them how to structure their sentences and how to make themselves heard and understood by others.\n5. The options given include: making music, believing in God.\n6. Making music is an activity related to improving speaking skills. For example, it involves rhythm, tone, pitch, and other components that come into play in both speaking and singing.\n7. Believing in God is probably related in terms of teaching children to pray. \n8. Therefore, they can be eliminated as invalid options.\n9. On the other hand, \"giving speeches\" is a practice that can apply to both speech therapists and public speaking professionals, as both professions work with delivering speeches in an understandable and relatable way. \n10. However, \"building houses\" is an activity that doesn't contribute much to improving speaking skills as the tasks performed are quite different.\n11.

'cellar', due to its size, is unlikely to be found in the possession of a single person.\n7) Choice D:'mailbox' could be a possible area to avoid due to the existence of spiders in this environment; however, if one is not afraid of them, there's no need to avoid them altogether.\n8) Finally, choice A:'meadow' eliminates itself because it is unlikely that someone would choose to have a specific type of area in their home; moreover, spiders are more likely to be found in dark damp places rather than a large field of grass.\n9) Therefore, the final answer is B.\nSo the final choice is B.\n\nInput: Which could be at what it's known as after the person died?

If you don't understand what I'm saying, don't worry because I'm going to explain.\n2) It's clear that sharpening knives is not an activity done in a kitchen because it's done outside of the kitchen and is something you don't do in the kitchen, but it is related to the kitchen. Therefore, it's the best option.\n3) Also, the given options are 2 of the following: making juice, mixing ingredients, taking out the garbage, sharpening knifes, chopping.

Both words describe something that is not sturdy, and as explained to us in the clue, we're looking for something that has strong bowel movements.\n2) Next, it'd be useful to analyze the word \"laxative\". As we all know, laxatives can be classified as either stimulant laxatives or bulk-forming laxatives. Stimulant laxatives are prescribed to treat constipation by inducing evacuation through musculoskeletal stimulation of the lower intestine. In contrast, bulk-forming lactatives increase fecal bulk in the intestine to soften and move stool through the colon. This helps with cases of constipation, but can also cause diarrhea. Thus, it is more suited to promote bowels than strongwoman, cake or weak, which are not bowels at all.\n3) Therefore, the correct answer to the question is \"regular\" based on the fact that it can be related to \"laxative\u201d, which induces regularity in bowel movements.\nSo the final answers is A: Regular\n\nInput: What might prevent person from getting job?

All five options are related to card games. The options are: Sea world, Court room, Shallow waters, Poker game and Card shark.\n2. The clues: A \"card player\" and there being an \"aquarium in the background\" are used in the question to describe the environment of the table where the card game is being played. \n3. After closely analyzing the options, we come to the conclusion that \" Sea world\" cannot be the option since it is unrelated to card games. \n4. Also, \"Court room\" doesn't match the given clues because a \"court room\" is not considered to be a place where card games are played. Moreover, a card game is played with one's mind, not with physical things as in the option, which is \"Card shark\". Therefore, we can eliminate these two options, and finally, we are left with \"Poker game\" and \" Shallow waters\".\n5. Now we have to determine which of the two options are incorrect to confirm which is correct. \n6. In the given option, \"Poker game\", the game consists of multiple people on the table at one time, whereas in the option, \" Shallow waters\". There is only a single individual. \n7.

What did the restaurant do? Choices: Decrease the price of each item\n\nOutput: The given information describes how 'a restaurant' increased its hours of operations as a result of the increase in demand for their services.

But the restaurant can increase", "answer": "D: say you're welcome"}

D: the first door has two colors. E: the second door has two colors.\nOutput: The sentence says that there are a red door and a blue door.\n1. A is wrong as the sentence does not refer to the color of anything being the same color as the door. \n2. B is wrong because there is only one word connecting colors and the door color is \"red\" and \"blue\", and 'color' is not the correct pronunciation. In fact, the two words should match in pronunciation: \u201cThe red door.\u201d, \u201cThe blue door.\u201d.\n3. C is wrong because the sentence does not refer the color of the doors or anything which is behind them and \"color\" occurs with \"door\" and not \"color\".\n4.

When deciding on the answer, it is also important to understand the negative connotation of 'obtuse', which is more than 'pointed' or 'acute, but rather 'blunt' and 'lacking clarity'.\n3. Therefore, the phrase is more about something that isn't sharp or pointed, so an option like 'clear' wouldn't work since clarity needs to be precise and not blunt.\n4. Options B: 'pointed' and C: 'acute' are both types of angles, which would be incorrect so we can eliminate them.\n5. E: 'angled' is also related to angles, which is not the focus here.\n6.

The remaining options (\"nearest house,\" \"workplace,\" \"surface of earth,\" \"office block,') cannot be answered using the verb \"miss\".\n3. For example, using the phrase \"nearest house\" would imply that the human may have been longing for his home/house, which is not necessarily what the question asks.\n4. Similarly, using \"workplace\" would imply that the question is about \"office block\", and \"surface of earth\" implies that the human is longing for Earth as a whole.\n5. Based on this, the answer could be C: \"surface of earth\".\n6. However, an alternative answer could be D \"workplace\" because the longing implied by using that phrase could be a sense of missing one's surroundings that the human is accustomed to.\n7. Another possibility is E \"office block\".\n8. This would be applicable if the word \"looked down longingly\" is used to convey a sense of remorse or guilt about missing one's workplace or office block.\n9.

Choices: A: in the oven B: underneath the sushi C: in the fridge D: near the table E: at the restaurant\nOutput: Here's how we could use the instructions, along with various choice options, to arrive at the right answer. 1) Firstly, we had to figure out if it were sushi on sushi or sushi in sushi to determine the location of the sushi. 2) As per the given options, sushi could either be underneath the sashimi, in the oven, near the table, or in the fridge. 3) We eliminated the options, 'near the table' and 'in the fridge' based on the clues that it was a certain restaurant that has a pork-infused sushi 4) Now, the only way for pork to be in sushi was if the sushi was in the sashimi to begin with. This meant that we could consider the 'underneath the sush,' option. 5) The choice 'underneath the fish' is incorrect since fish is a freshwater fish. Instead, it is only pork-infused underneath the other sushi ingredients. 6", "answer": "C: superior"}

Choices:  - A: he's making a silly face at you  - B: he's giving you a compliment  - C: he's not complimenting you  - D: he's praising your work   - E: he's throwing a party for you\nOutput: 1: \"How can you tell if your employer is happy?\" the phrase \"employer\" refers to a \"boss\", because they are typically the person in charge of assigning tasks to their employers, such as \"boss\"(s). Additionally, the phrase \"employees\" refers to people who are being supervised or controlled by their employer (the \"boss\"). So, the question can only ask about things relevant to your \"boss\" (the \"supervisor\"/person making assignments).\n2. The word \"silly\" in \"is making a silly face at\" does not fit the context of the question. It's also a nonsensical word choice, as the employer wouldn't be \"making\" a silly face at you, as it would be you who were \"seeing\" the face and not the boss who would be \"making\" it.\n3. The phrase \"he's giving you a complement\" refers to a positive comment or action intended to highlight your strengths or abilities.\n4.

Choices: 1 A: tape B: hair C: beard D: fingernail E: mustache\nOutput: This question is asking about two different words that both have long names. The word \"cut\" is obviously referencing the action one can take, so one must first decide which word it is referring to. 1.) A Tape: It is a narrow strip of an adhesive substance. The word that has a long name in this case would be the word \"tape\". The name is 21 letters, and a good name to cut it down would be the shortened name which is \"tape\". 2.) A Hair: This is an animal coat made up of dead cells. It is called \"hair hair\". An accurate reduction is the shortened version \"hair\". 3.) A Beard: It is a covering of hair on the faces of human men. It is called \"beard beard\". An accurate reduction is \"beard\". 4.) A Mustache: It's a hair growth directly above one's upper lip, which covers one's mouth. It is called \"mustache mustache\". An accurate reduction is simply \"mustache\". 5.)

This does not apply as a method to hear what the professor says.\n4. \"Complete test\" is similar to \"take notes\", which is also different from what the prompt asks.\n5.

Choices: 1 inch 2 inches 5 inches 6 inches 7 inches\nOutput: 1 A: The person would move an additional 2 inches in every 60 seconds. \n2 Since there's no mention of a maximum distance or a starting point from the statement, the person could potentially move inch by inch, for the rest of their life, which would be 8,640in in 51,840 seconds. Which is over 7 miles.\n3 The person would move 4 inches less per second with this new superpower than without it.\n4 This statement seems to say that they are already capable of moving at 2 inches per second, and now could move 4 inches per second in addition to it. Hence none of these are possible.\n5 If a person had the ability of moving any distance at 2 inches per 2 seconds, any point in the first 6 seconds would mark the time they travel 1 inch from the starting point. \n6 So the answer is B: 2 inches\n\n\n\nGot any other logic puzzle questions here, feel free to let me know via a comment on the blog!", "answer": "C: listen carefully"}

Choices:  B: working  C: taking a break D: talking  E: walking F: standing  G: writing H: looking\nOutput: The employee isn't working when she's not on the schedule.\n1- The manager wouldn't call her to take a day off.\n2- The manager probably wouldn't invite her out just to talk and walk around.\n3- She probably hasn't been fired yet for being on the schedule.\n4- So she is most likely taking a break instead of working.\n5- The question is asking what the employee would do after she was on the schedule but wasn't working. \n6- But she had no break and she wasn't working, so the manager must've given her a break after all, so she could do what she is doing now: Taking a break.\n7- So, the correct answer is option G: \"taking a break\".\nSo the final answer will be G: taking a break\n\nInput: What place could the person bring to be in style and comfortable?

{"idx": 930, "text": "1) The question asks for the type of theater which has unpaid actors, in other words, actors who do not get paid.\n2) An unpaid acting job is an actual profession, thus theaters that employ unpaid actors must be legitimate theaters, i.e., they are not mere pretentious'stage plays'.\n3) A'stage play', or theater play on a small scale, is usually done in a home for practice, or at the very least for a community event such as a local fair. A'stage play' would be staged in someone's home so it cannot be a suitable answer here.\n4) A 'populated area' as per its dictionary definition, means some part of a larger city with people residing and working in it. The theater in a populated area must provide a service for the people living in that part of the city, and the actors appearing on stage must be paid.\n5) If the theater is only visited by military or military personnel, then an unpaid actor is a likely candidate. But this is not what the question is asking.\n6) The best answer is \"school\". This is because a school theater is not necessarily a profession; one normally performs in school to get experience in acting, or to enjoy an activity where people have fun together. As such, a school theater may use unpaid actors, and may be a suitable answer for the question.\nSo the final answers is A: school", "answer": "D: school"}

Choices:  L: pull it from the water. M: feed it to a goat. N: put on the stove. O: use it for cooking. P: pull it off the grill.\nOutput: \nStep 1: The poker is probably a firearm or a weapon, which makes \"pull the poker\" a bad choice.\nStep 2. The poker needs to go back on the fire after \"pulling it from the water\", which makes \"put it on the stove\" a bad choice. \nStep 3: The poker's heat can't possibly be harmful to a goat, making \"feed it to a goat\" an inappropriate answer.\nStep 4. If the poker is removed from the fire, it needs to go back, which makes \"pull it off the grill\" a bad option.\nStep 6. The poker needs cooling after it's pulled from the fire, which makes \"put it in water\" a bad choice. Also, putting the poker into the water would cause a problem when people are using it to cook.\n\nThat leaves us with two choices: L: pull it from your water. and \"O: Use it for cooking.\"\n\nStep 6: It states that you are most likely doing one of these options. \nStep 7: So, the most likely thing to", "answer": "E: fabric store"}

Option 2 talks about the opposite of the way a boss should act and is probably exclusionary. No boss should be aggressive and bossy, and it is an oxymoron to say like this that they are. 3. Bossy, in option 3, is also used to describe a bossy person. Aggressive and domineering are common characteristics of bossy people. 4. The description of option 4 is also common, and it is not an uncommon trait to tell others what to do, especially if one is the boss. 5. Option 5 means someone who tells the real truth, not someone who", "answer": "B: new mexico"}

Choices:  Choices:  A. Favorite daughter B. Favorite son C. Favorite uncle D. Favorite cousin E. Favorite father\nOutpu: We need to determine whether this is a relationship between two people of the same gender or different genders.\n1. 'Relationship' indicates a connection between a set of two people and 'favorite' indicates how special that set of two is.\n2. So they must be related to each other and that there is a connection between both parties and that they matter to each other.\n3. To identify the kind of relationship between the two persons, we need to understand whether they are both women or a woman and a man, in which case they would be sisters or cousins in relation to each other.\n4. The 'favorite' keyword also gives us an indicator that there is something more than just mere biological sisters or cousains and that they are likely better-related than cousins or sisters, but not parents.\n5.

Step 1: Eliminate any answer that is redundant to the question.\nStep 2 : Since the game might be played in either a \"stadium\" or a \"jocks\", the context in which the game is played would be redundant information. \nStep 3 : Because the question only asks what type of room one would be heading to after getting a \"green drink\" from the given options, we don't need to know whether the game is played in a \"stadium\" either by itself or with other game options in the game. \nStep 4 : The \"fitness center\" might make sense if the scenario involved going to the gym to have a green drink after playing a game or other activity.\nStep 5 : However, the question asks which type of room is appropriate, and a \"fitness center\" would not be one.\nStep 6 : A \"green drink\" could simply be a soft drink or drink that is made of green ingredients.\nStep 7 : It is important to know that green ingredients only mean food or non-alcoholic drinks that match the color green in any given food item.\nStep 8 : Therefore, if the question asks for the best location after completing the drink, the most appropriate answer is \"stadium\" because the stadium will be one place where you might head to after drinking a green drink. \nStep 9 : We can conclude that since the context is not necessary for the answer, we can simply eliminate its information.\nStep 10 : After eliminating unnecessary info, the best answer is D: stadium. \nSo the final answer here is D: stadium\n\nInput: What type of personality would people generally think I am?

We can also understand this in terms of \"the body of a vehicle\" stopping because \"it had to rest\".\n4. This points to the fact that the options 'working','moving' and exercising are incorrect answers because a body can't do them, the same way a vehicle can't exercise, walk, or lay down in the day.\n5. If you read the question carefully, you will notice that no matter what work \"he\" would be involved in, his body always had to rest at the end of the day.\n6.

Options B,D and E are interchangeable. Option D(disappointed), and option E(impressed), do not match the sentence so we can eliminate them. Option B (out shined), refers to a type of clothing, so it is incorrect. Option C(out done), is the same as option E(impressed )and E is already eliminated, so this option is incorrect.

This\nanswer was derived by looking at what was necessary to choose and what could\npossibly be a factor.\n1. The question contains two variables: what to wear and what to do.\n2. The first step is to analyze this question in terms of the choice available.\n3. This means that looking at the choices and using the given context you have to\nwork out the answers.\n4. Firstly, we can eliminate the answer 6 because it's impossible to have bad fashion\nsense if one does not have anything or nothing to decide from.\n5.

{"idx": 63, "text": "1: The question in the problem asks us to identify a situation where people try to hash things out (resolve a problem or dispute) and the given choices provide clues to this situation.\n2. The given context is: \u201cThey decided to hash things\u2026\u201d to hash something out is to try to resolve a situation or dispute by having a discussion.\n3. The term hash out comes from the word to \"hash\", which means to hit or strike with force.\n4. In the context provided in the question hash denotes \"discuss\".\n5. Looking at the clues given, \u201cdrinks\u201d represent something which is enjoyed to alleviate stress and make the time pass more pleasantly.\n6. Therefore, drinks should be a distractor to the situation and not an object that is useful or helpful.\n7. Out of the choices given, only \u201csuicide\u201d and \u201cmurder\u201d make sense, \u201cmurder\u201d is more likely as an outcome because in a situation where people are trying to resolve a dispute, a more likely way to resolve the situation would be by \"suicide\".\n8. Additionally, \u201csuicide\u201d is more likely than \u201cmurder\u201d since its an act of \"personal agency\" as compared to \u201cmurder\u201d which is something that is performed when someone loses control over themselves.\n9.

{"idx": 67, "text": "1: The question revolves around a 'cut' that \"she made\", but it's the opposite of a healing process - stitching or joining pieces together, which might be the case with cutting a pie.\n2. It's more likely that it is a figurative cut rather than literal since its scars would never \"stitch together\" or \"heal\" but would \"never put together\".\n3. Although 'Paste' refers to a material used to cure scars, the cut itself is not literal. Also, we know that it is a 'figurative' cut (which we know means it is a cut in figurative or metaphoric sense) and not literal, so it is not necessary for \"she\" to cover \"its figurative scars with paste\".\n4. The remaining options are literal scars as they are not metaphorical.\n5. Considering all of these factors, the conclusion that the 'cut' is figurative and not literal helps rule out \"stitch\" and \"join\" as an answer.\n6. The remaining answer choices include \"never put together\" - this answers the question completely, but that is not the case here.\n7. As the choices are \"never put together\", \"never heal\", and \"never put together and never heal\", \"never put together & never heal\" is the correct answer. \n8.

The remaining options \"leave\" or \"has arrived\" can't be understood appropriately at this point as they don't have any context and the question is not in the direction of finding the answer for \"has arrived\", as it doesn't explain when the lady has arrived, so the answer is \"G: leave\".\n3.

It is a question which is meant to judge the actions of people in the puzzle so that we can recognize what \"special\" trait they have.

However, it is not the only way to make someone special, and there are many others.\n5. For example, \"He was sitting still\" is not the correct answer despite it making someone special because sitting still is something we do all the time and is not something extra ordinary.\n6. \"He was smiling\" is one of the least probable answers in this puzzle because just smiling does not necessarily make one special. Smiling can have other reasons besides making one special, even if they are temporary. For example, smiling could mean that you like a particular person or could mean that you are trying to cheer up someone in pain. Smiling is not limited to making someone feel special. \n7.", "answer": "C: have tools"}

The phrase itself tells us the nature of the action. It would be used to make a big splashed.\n3. The question also asks us to answer \"from where should we throw it?\", and it can be answered best by considering the options that can be used to \"make a big splash\"\n4. Choices (A): \"mountains countryside\" and (B): \"ground\" can be used to make a \"big splash\", but are not appropriate for throwing a rock, which is the given action.\n5. Choice (C): \"bridge\" is not used to make a splash.\n6. Choices (D): \"mountain range\" and (E): \"surface of earth\" can be used to throw a rock, and are also used to make a splashed, but \"surface of earth \" is an absurd choice that cannot be used to throw a big splashed, therefore we reject it.\n7.

{"idx": 135, "text": "1) The question's clue refers to \"food\" as a \"something\", which means it's an activity-type question.\n2) It also states that the food is probably associated with places. So, food can't be found in a supermarket or in an \"office building\" unless one is referring to the supermarket or office building on the location where food is sought. \n3) Considering that one would typically expect to find \"foods\", not foods, in locations where people look for food, one would be more likely to search for supermarkets or a farmer's market.\n4) Given the options, the \"supermarket\" could be an appropriate place for shopping for the desired foods.\n5) In certain situations, certain food products could also be found in a \"conference\" in reference to food that is typically consumed at those events. However, looking specifically at the context, the \"food\" question is likely pertaining to everyday food items that one would regularly find in stores or on a menu when they go out for lunch/dinner.\n6) Since restaurants could be found in \"apartments\", searching the building for restaurants to eat at could be a likely choice, as an apartment complex could include restaurants or food service outlets on their premises.\n7) So, the answer is A: opera, supermarket, and conference.\nSo the final answers are A: opera B:supermarket C:conference \n\nInput: What are you likely to be doing while having lunch with family?

It isn't about doing, it is about being, as we are asked to pick the activity from the given options, rather than any actual activity we would do at lunch with the family.\n3.) As mentioned earlier, the phrase in this sentence is an activity, so the answer would be an activity too, as the phrase and the activity are related.\n4.)

In summary, the answer is a place where \"cool\" temperatures is experienced.\n8) Option D - a \"hot room\" - doesn't meet the criteria of the question since hot doesn't mean cool.\n9) Option A - a \"home\" - doesn't fit either since homes often experience hot temperatures.\n10) Option C - \"home\" - is a good option as a place to go over all items when having cool temperatures experienced in a given place.\n11) Option A - a room may have cool temperatures as well as hot temperatures, whereas a \"home\" refers to a place or dwelling where people live and isn't a good option for our context.\n12) Choice B, an \"office\", is a good choice as a place to go since it may have a cool environment, as well as a heated one.\n13) The most likely option is B - \"office\".\nSo the final answer to the question is B - \"office\"\n\n## Participants\n\n29 people signed up for the competition \n\n## Solutions", "answer": "A: home"}

Since  the wording of this question has only ice cream as the answer, not ice-cream, it makes sense to think about the age range for eating ice cream.  \n2. They can be more than teens. When you're thinking about ice cream you think kid since adults eat frozen dessert but you don't say ice cream every time. So, they can be anyone.\n3. They can be 30 years old too but not more than 30 years, which is why that answer is not the right answer.\n4: They can be 5 years old too, but that doesn't sound right either.\n5: They can be kiddos or kids and since you say ice cream every few sentences when you're talking to kids at any age, this may work for you.

{"idx": 155, "text": "1) The given sentence is a question related to the usage of the word \"level\" which is stated as an option here.\n2) Level is a measurement used to refer to position, height, or depth in relation to a surface or in relation to sea level as is widely used in geography and the related fields. \n3) It can also be used figuratively to refer to position on a scale or hierarchy. But, in the given text, there is a clear mention of a \"city\" which is the context of the question. Therefore, it should be related to geographical measurement as well as hierarchy, to suit the context, which means we need an option that refers to \"the total number\" of hierarchy as well as the position.  \n4) The choices given here are for \"city\", and it doesn't make any sense to ask or relate them to the question.\n5) The only option that fulfils the requirement is \"Buildings in a city are usually associated with a certain height, and are in turn associated with the total number of floors or levels that a building has\".\n6) Hence, the answer is E.\nSo the final answers is E: Building\n\nInput: What do we likely see in person if they took the exam?

The phrase \"one of many rooms\" highlights a fact that no child living in a wealthy household has just one room for its play.\n4.

Although it's true that some people play aggressively when they're laughing, laughing is also subjective and dependent on the perception and personality of the people watching.\n5. \"Laughter\" is a subjective feeling and isn't directly related to the answer.\n6. \"Getting hungry\" is a possible answer, but it doesn't exactly reflect the aggressive act of the person. Moreover, it contradicts with the fact that the person playing the sport was trying to score more by playing aggressively.\n7. \"Feeling happy\" also does not directly relate to the person's actions, and cannot be the answer.\n8.

Furthermore, the question talks about the Kingdom, thus, ruling out both options.\n4.

Eliminating answer E leads us to the final answer, C: see our favorite show.\nSo the final answers is C: see our favorite Show\n\nInput:What will you hear if you are walking your dog and listening to music? Choices: 1) A: the music B: barking dogs C) neither D) the dog 2) E: other people 3) D: a song\nOutput: 1) After eliminating answer D as a distraction, and answer A as an impossibility, it's easy to come to the realisation that answer C is simply incorrect. 2) The question now comes down to two options - A and E. \n3) Looking at the examples, it is clear that one can hear other people or that people can hear you, but it should be clear that the two scenarios are not similar. So we can eliminate answer A.\n4) As for answer E, given the context of the question, one cannot hear things happening in the distance. \n5) After considering the possible answers, the natural selection should be that A) you will hear the dog.\nSo the", "answer": "E: see favorite show"}
{"idx": 419, "text": "1) We can interpret \"the sample\" as a substance or liquid. The question indicates that the sample needed to be of a certain purity, but that was not achieved.\n2) So the only option available now is the one that can be used to describe \"the sample\" not meeting the desired purity.\n3) Out of the given options, \"corrupt\", \"applied\", \"dirty\" and \"contaminated\" don't make much sense for a purity-related purpose.\n4) So we don't have a lot of options left. Now the meaning of \"pure\" can be used to find answers that fit in the given context, i.e. \"not compromised in quality\".\n5) So, \"fresh\" and \"clean\" fit into the criteria and can be options for the answer, and now the options with nonstandard words like \"corrupt\" can be eliminated. \n6) The final answer then becomes either Choice B: \u201cApplied\u201d or D: \u201cContaminated\u201d, as both can describe how the sample ended up being \u201cnot corrupt\u201d or \u201cnot compromised\u201d.\nSo the final answer (E) is either B: \u201cApplied\u201d, D: \u201cContaminating\u201d\n\nInput: Her hair was long and black, she must be what?

Out of the given traits, some are general physical characteristics of a person that are not related to the hair length and color, and some others are inappropriate descriptions for the given situation.\n3.)

{"idx": 423, "text": "1.`The question asks what you need before buying products.\n2. Options A, D, E are inappropriate.\n3. Options B and C describe buying habits.\n4. The question does not ask what you should buy, but what to do before buying.\n5. Option A talks about having a desire, which you might want to have before buying. To be specific, after you decide what to buy, you may find yourself thinking about buying the product. That is, you may develop a desire before buying it. But that wouldn't be the first step to buy the product.\n6. Option B talks about buying stuff with money, which is a step for buying a product. That is, if you have money on hand, you are more likely to buy products with it. That doesn't mean you should have money before buying products. So this option is wrong.\n7. Option C talks about having money to buy products. That is, if a product is too expensive, you may refuse buying it in hopes that you'll spend less one day. But it doesn't say you should have money to buy products first. Moreover, the option talks about having money, which is a general description of money spent on products. So it also does not match the question.\n8. Option D talks about the products being necessary. That is, to buy all the necessary items, you must have money to purchase it. But this option does not explicitly state you should have money to make products necessary.\n9. Option E talks about having the time to purchase products. This means that if it's too busy to have the time to purchase products, you may have to wait to buy it. But it does not say you need to have the time to buy products first. Therefore, the correct answer is C: money.\nSo the final Answer is C: money\n\nInput:What would someone need before they need to go to a funeral?

{"idx": 427, "text": "Firstly, it's necessary to understand that the question is asking about the effect/consequence of noises on humans.\n1. \"Humans\" is the subject while the action \"being exposed to noises\" will be the verb in the question.\n2. Therefore, it can be said that humans will experience different reactions to noises.\n3. Looking into the options, 'pet the dog', 'have sex' and'reproduce' are the actions (verbs) which involve human beings, and also are relevant to noises.\n4. But the action of hearing is actually a sense, and therefore, not an action of humans hearing sounds. \n5. Further, options D: 'drive cars' and E:'reproduce' can still be valid actions when one chooses to do them. But they are not applicable in the context.\n6. So the correct answer is C: hear sounds.\nSo the final option is C: hear sounds\n\nInput: What can you have if the restaurant closes too early? Choices:  food A: lunch B: dinner C: meal D: snack E: salad\nOutput: The question is asking about what you can have if a restaurant closes too early, that you cannot have otherwise.\n1. Food/eat is the verb followed by \"too early\", so the meaning is that you cannot have food if the restaurant is closed early, like at 4/5 pm (2/3pm for us). \n2. Therefore, the options other than A: Lunch and C: meal, that are both foods offered in the day, are not relevant to this question.\n3. So we can reject choices B: dinner and E: sandwich.\n4. Choice D: Snack is a food as well, and so it is not a valid answer choice either.\n5. The rest of the options are more or less not relevant to the question and can be rejected. \n6. Hence, we can conclude that the answer is A: Lunch\nSo the final answer if lunch\n\nInput: Some were made but lost, what are not kept in time?

In order to answer this question we first have to make an impasse between the given choice options and then choose the one which fits perfectly with the situation.\n3. Out of the given options, some of them seem to be related to the concept of a \"large container\". The options that fit that criteria are B(Garden), C(Supermarket) and D(Warehouse).\n4. The phrase \"The giant warehouse\" indicates that the container in question was more than just a \"large\" one. It essentially meant \"giant\" and also \"warehouse\".\n5. The correct answer needs to match perfectly with the given context. In this case, \"giant\" is the only option that suits the context, making the answer option D: Giant.\nSo the final answers are C: Supermarket B: Garden\n\nInput:They sold more than five million at the price that was given, some customers who purchased the what?

{"idx": 435, "text": "Firstly, let's look at each choice and decide whether they have any connection to death.\n1. Choice A is \"age grieving person\". This seems to be a strange choice because \"age\" is related to how old someone is, but we can't determine from this choice whether this age is linked to death.\n2. Choice B is \"heavy heart attacks\". This appears to be a reasonable option because heart attacks can be a lethal health condition, but again, it doesn't tell us whether this affects death or not.\n3. Choice C is \"depression\". Depression can be a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, but it's still not clear if this has a direct connection to death.\n4. Choice D is \"hair loss\". Hair loss, while perhaps detrimental to a person's appearance and self-confidence, doesn't seem like a reason for death.\n5. Choice E is \"headache\". While headaches can be painful and may indicate underlying health issues, they don't have an immediate cause of death.\n6. Therefore, the only answer that appears to be closely related to death is choice C which is \"depression\".\nSo the final answer for this puzzle is C: depression\n\nInput: What was the person doing because they were the first of three children? Choices:  None\nOutput: The logical step here is to eliminate all the choices without a logical explanation.\n1. 'None' would most likely not be a correct answer choice, as you could not do \"none\" of the given things listed in the question.\n2. 'None' would also not be a suitable answer due to the \"first of three children\" factor. A person's first child could not be done in a way that allows them to be the first of three children, as the first of three requires that there are at least three siblings. Therefore, 'none' would not fit as a realistic answer because it assumes that there had been other children born before the one in question.\n3. 'One' would not be suitable as an answer because 'one' would be an incorrect description of the action in the question. The question asks for 'what the person was doing', not 'how many more actions could be added to his or her actions to make them be able to be the first of", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

Choices: \nA: a refrigerator\nB: a freezer\nC: a truck\nD: a microwave\nE: a cooking stove\nOutput:  1. The question refers to the things that can be purchased from a person \"for an oven\".\n2. The words and phrases \"get\", \"person\", \"purchase\", and \"for\" emphasize that there is a relationship between the \"person\" and the \"thing\" being bought.\n3. The given sets of options are arranged by a logical hierarchy such that \"a microwave\" would be the most appropriate option for an oven, meaning the least expensive.\n4.

Option A: \"unemployment\" might be acceptable as an answer in other circumstances, but it is not necessarily a result of a \"good job\".\n3.) Other mentioned options like perks, vacation, sick leave, more time off, are all characteristics of a job rather than result of the job so these cannot be correct.\n4.)

Choices:  (Note that the customer's names have been altered for clarity.)   A: the best B: the worst C: the first D: the second E: the third\nOutput: 1.) The problem entails determining which customer would not be the \"first\".\n2.) To do so, one must first be aware of the criteria for the title \"first' customer, which can change depending on the context. \n3.) In the present context, it is evident that customers cannot be ranked based on their time of arrival.\n4.) Thus, the first customer would simply be a customer among the first group, and not necessarily the \"first\" customer to arrive.\n5.) The remaining customers would then be the other \"first\" customers to arrive.\n6.)

The reason why the choice D: office supply store is incorrect is because the office supply store is a place where you can buy paper, but the paper cannot be bought in bulk, as these stores generally stock small/medium sized sheets in the range of 5x7.\n4. The reason why the other option, the artist's studio, is incorrect, is because artist's studio is a place that is for the artist's personal use and does not sell paper.\n5.

The given question is designed to check whether the word \"shop\" is used in the context of a place that sells \"hats\", \"food\", \"clothing\", \"beverages\" or \"towels\". The word \"sells\" in itself indicates that \"shop\" refers to an establishment for commercial purposes. Therefore, we are looking for a word that pertains to commercial goods.\n2.) In the given context, \"hats\" are obviously not sold in \"shop\", \"food\" and \"clothing\" are general household commodities rather than something that is associated with an individual retailer and, \"beverages\" are usually packaged in a plastic bottle. The context of the question itself eliminates the choice \"beverages\". \"Towels\" are usually sold in different types of \"shops\", not necessarily in the traditional retail \"shop\". In light of the context, the choice \"towels\" is also eliminated.\n3.) Coming to the remaining choices, \"hats\" can indeed be sold in a commercial \"shop\", \"clothing\", on the other hand, can also be sold in a commercial shop. However, this seems to be a vague answer and is not very specific to what is being asked. \"Food\", on the other hand is a generic type of commodity, rather than something specifically associated with commercial retail. Therefore, the two answer choices, \"clothing\" and \"hats\", are eliminated from the options.\n4.) This", "answer": "D: injuries"}

When we wake up and put the balls in motion, the balls are in motion all the time until we stop them. When that is the point all balls are at rest. If we were to wake up and put a ball \"in motion\", we would put at least one, and at most more than two or many balls in motion.

Based on these conditions, the \"school building\" can be eliminated because RVs are typically unable to plug into the outlets and electricity services in the school building.\n3. The \"toy store\" can be eliminated for similar reasons, for RVs are also not able to plug into the outlet. The toy store has electrical outlets to ensure that consumers can play with the toys. \n4. Similarly, the \"basement\" cannot have electrical power in it because it is inaccessible to John and unlikely to have many electrical outlets.\n5. Similarly, the \"building\" can be eliminated since RVs are not able to plug in in this location.\n\nThis leaves us with the \"rest area\", which provides a public parking lot with electrical outlets with a high level of accessibility.\n6. Therefore, the most probable answer is B: \"basement\".\nSo the final answer must be B: basement", "answer": "D: rest area"}

Even if they were, jewelry would still be a bulky item and likely wouldn't go well with a suitcase's limitations.\n3.'Department stores' and'safes' do not go together and aren't a safe way of transportation.\n4. So, the only remaining options are 'boudoirs' and 'these twos'.\n5. Since'safe' is also present in the question, 'these twos' is a plausible answer.\n6. But 'boudoirs', the other given option, are also feminine names.\n7. Therefore leaving the two remaining options of 'these twos', 'lady's boudoir' sounds a more plausible answer. \n8. 'These two' is an informal phrase of the phrase, 'these two people' suggesting a generalisation or stereotyping of all twos, including those that refer to numbers or objects, but as you can see, there are no twos listed in the question.\n9. Then what's left is the phrase 'lady's' referring to femininity or feminine things like hair accessories, makeup, jewellery and dresses.\n10. Now, looking at the remaining choices:\n11.'Suitcase' refers to something more masculine, unlike a boudoir, hence it is not a safe way of carrying jewelry.\n12.'Safety deposit box' refers to a box used to store, keep or hide things in a safe place and is typically found in a bank. This option can be disregarded as it makes no sense as well.\n13.'Department store' refers to a retail sales establishment that offers a wide variety of products and services to its customers. This would not be a safe way of carrying the jewelry. \n14. 'These twos' is grammatically incorrect and the phrase can't be formed into a compound noun. \n15. 'Safe deposit box' does not go well with the phrase 'transport jewellery'. These two options can be deducted as well.\n16.

That means \u201cI am buying insurance\u201d or \u201cI am purchasing an insurance\u201d. 3- The first sentence is written in a fact based way, while second sentence is written in a prescription based way. 4- The second sentence does not make sense as in case of driver ticket, we cannot insure \u201ctheir car\u201d. That\u2019s why the second sentence is not the correct sentence. 5- The first sentence can be the second sentence and then \u201cI am buying\u201d refers to a car. \u201cHer\u201d is incorrect. 6- The second sentence is not describing someone but a procedure. 7- \u201cHer\u201d refers to \u201cmy fines\u201d. 8- \u201cA ticket\u201d represents a procedure and it should be in plural. 9- In the first sentence, there is no context of \u201cher\u201d, where is \u201cher\u201d 10- \u201cA ticket\u201d is referring for \u201ca driving ticket\u201d.

The sentence contains the word \"both of your mom siblings\" which indicates plural.\n2.) The question asks where both of your mom sibling lives.\n3.)

Also, it suggests that being mad can be a way of communicating to the parents so they can help when it might seem like the kids don't want or like their help.\n4. The options given are guiding, understanding, controlling, and caring for the children.\n5. \"Guiding\" children suggests a positive effort by the parents towards child growth and development.\n6. \"Understanding\" the children's needs can result in a positive outcome and doesn't make sense in the given context.\n7. \"Controlling\" children is unrelated to the given question.\n8. \"Caring\" for the children is also incorrect because caring can lead to more agitation and control, but not helpful communication like \"yelling\".\n9.

You need more background knowledge of the term to pick the correct answer.\n4) Since the provided terms require a higher level of familiarity, we must eliminate them as possible choices.\n5) The term in question, the helm, would require a lower familiarity as it is a part of the ship that is already explained by the context. \n6) This means we can cross off everything from A: sailing boat and C: ship, as they don't require much prior knowledge other than the context.\n7) The same is true of E: tugboats as sailing and ships are the same thing, and tugboats are still a part of them.\n8) When we look at the options left with us, it is clear that helm and masts would be logical choices for a steering wheel.\n9) The context of this problem is clear that the steering wheel steers the masts of the ship, so the correct answer is E: tugboys.\nSo the final answers is E: tugboy\n\nInput: What's the opposite of green?

However, \"dairy farm\" is a specific kind of farm where you keep and milk cows or other types of dairies.\n4. So \"New Hampshire\" is probably a better choice, or, failing that \"Texas\" would still be a reasonable answer.\n5.\"County Fair\" is also an acceptable answer because that's where farm-raised animals meet in competitions and fairs.\n6.

This question is quite specific and the question could be asking which type of seller sells fabric for a curtain. Cutting fabric for a customer requires to do it in the perfect measurements as per the request and then cut the fabric as per the request. So, this scenario can be answered by a tailor. A tailor is one who stitches clothes or fabric. So, the answer to the question is \"A: tailor shop\" because this question asks the type of seller who cuts fabric to order.\n\n### Question [2]\n\nThere can be two solutions to this question. Option B is the right answer for this question. Oil can be used for a lot of things. Oil is one of the ingredients used in medicine in the form of oils and lotions. Oil can be referred to as a lubricant which is applied to prevent friction and helps to smooth movement. Option B: A tailor makes alterations to fabric for your fitness or style needs, which means that tailor is the right answer for the question.\n\n###  Question [3]\n\nThe statement \"Where are you if your reading books while waiting for a vehicle.\" is asking about your location if you are reading a book. So this question is looking for a place where a person can read books and waits for a vehicle. The answer to this question would be \"B: train station\" because the most feasible location would be a bookstore or the library, however, this doesn't mean a train station can not be one of the solutions.\n\n### question [4]\n\nThe statement \u201cWhat would you use if you\u2019re cutting your nails?\" is looking for an answer which matches \u201ccutting n", "answer": "C: car show"}

So only options A, B and D are relevant here.\n2) Shopping malls are places or buildings with retail businesses, where people purchase merchandise. So, they cannot be a parking lot where people can park with shopping bags. So, they cannot get an option in the answer. Hence, this leaves us with options A, B and E.\n3) Option B indicates urban areas where people usually buy and carry their bags.\n4) Option D refers to a parking lot in a shopping mall. Therefore, the only option remaining is A which is: \"amusement park\".\n5) Hence, the answer is A: amusement park.\nSo the finalanswer is A: amusementpark\n\nInput:What type of person wears hats?

{"idx": 707, "text": "1 and 2. The phrase \"overkill\" means to do more damage than is necessary or to do too much work.\n2. When using a cannon to shoot at an object, it would do more damage than is required to kill an animal for lunch.\n3. Given the options, the only logical target of the cannon is C: \"bomber\" as \"bomber\" refers to a military aircraft used for delivering explosive projectiles.\n4. \"Bomber\" is not an animal, a person, or \"body armor\" since it is a military aircraft. Also, the phrase \"it was overkill\" means the shooting was too much.\n5. Therefore the options to eliminate are A: body armor (is not an animal or a person), and B: ungulate (is not a bomber).\n6. Therefore, \"James\" most likely shot a \"bomber\" with a cannon while seeking for \"lunch\".\n7. This means that the answer is D: bombs.\n8. Bomb is plural for \"bomber\" so you could pick \"bombs\" as correct answer or write \"bomber\".\nSo the final answer  is D: bombs\n\nInput:What did the thief hide, where they stole from someone? Choices:  They stole from an apartment that was being remodeled. B: a safe C: furniture D: cash E: tools\nOutput: 1) First of all, it's worth noting that the answers to the \"What was hidden\" and \"What did they take\" questions are not independent but rather interrelated to each other.\n2) For this reason, we will explain answers to both questions at once together, as in: This means that the answer to question \"What did they hide\" is the same as to the \"Question 2: What did they take.\"\n3) To find out what they stole, we have to find out what they hid, and that's because they can't have hid something that they didn't take/stole, as the phrase \"that was being remodeled\" indicates.\n4) The meaning behind this question and the given options can be summarized as follows: They stole something from the thief's apartment (the \"place it was stolen from\") being remodeled", "answer": "B: ungulate"}

The options given are \"tie shoelace\", \"rest\", \"tiredness\", \"run longer\", and \"sit down\",\n3. If he was tired for running and tripped, then he did not rest properly, \n4. Tying shoelace is a good idea because with running shoes, the laces sometimes untie while running, then he might trip, which means \"tie shoelaces\" is the most logical answer.\n5. The other options are unrelated to the context, except for \"run longer\". However, the context states that he would have been in a running escape.\n6. \"Sit down\" isn't an option either because \"running escape\" doesn't involve sitting down.\n7. \"Tiredness\" may be correct or wrong, but that isn't the issue since whether tiredness is caused by running so fast or sitting down is irrelevant.\n8. Finally, upon analysing all the options, \"tie shoelaced\" makes the most sense.\nSo the final choice is A: tie shoelaced\n\nInput: Where might a person find a vandalism? Choices: 1. Building 2.

Choices:  A. The kitchen B. Back alley C. Aisle D. Parking Lot\nOutput: 1. The clue is that the shop is \"small\" and, therefore, \"not big enough\".\n2. Therefore, we need to eliminate all the options that involve storing a bike in a big space.\n3. The choice that doesn't satisfy this condition is B: \"the kitchen\".\n4. \"Kitchen\" implies that the premises contain a fully-functioning kitchen and has appliances and equipment in place that help a housewife to cook and prepare food.\n5. But a kitchen also includes a countertop area and a stove, which will make it impossible for a bike to be stored there.\n6. The other choice that would be eliminated is D: \"parking lot\".\n7.

{"idx": 723, "text": "1. The answer is \"fall asleep\" because the question implies that, although watching television or playing with a smartphone might be routines, they do not help the body fall asleep. Additionally, television and phones can disrupt sleep and keep people awake. \n2. The question involves a \"routine\", but the answer refers to the sleep cycle, so it's not really a \"routine\".\n3. To elaborate further: watching television or playing with your phone might be routine activities that are commonly done by people during free time, but they do not necessarily lead to falling asleep.\n4. The answer should indicate what helps the body fall asleep, which should be routine and related to the sleep cycle.\n5. \"Have tv\" is not an appropriate answer because falling asleep does not involve \"having\" tv or other devices. And it doesn't make sense because the question is worded as \"help\", not \"have\".\n6. \"Learn\", \"sitting\", and \"dancing\" are not appropriate answers because they're incompatible with the mentioned action.\n7.

A designer handbag is considered an 'authentic' product as it has been manufactured by an individual designer.\n4. A 'certificate of authentic', even if it is issued, would not mean the product is \"legitimate\", as that term pertains to it being \"lawful\", \"true\" and \"legally permitted\".\n5.

It is quite obvious that the person wouldn't be fired, as such an outcome would be undesirable.\n2.

It is implied that \"it\" is a person (an individual) whom the respondent is referring to in that sentence.\n2. If \"the incident\" is also something which was caused by a person then it can be inferred that the arrest may be linked to the \"incident\".\n3. Looking at this in the context provided, the man was arrested for murder and the incident he is being charged for would be the murder.\n4. So \"it refers to the man in which case 'they will keep trying\" and \"it was a good place to live\" and \"he did a good job\" are all irrelevant to the man's arrest. \n5. However, considering that 'they' is the correct pronoun here, \"it\" can also refer to the man's murder. In such case, the", "answer": "A: drink tea"}

The term \"lead\" refers to having the first place or the best position.\n\n2. The first two options are related to large, heavy objects, such as \"very heavy\" and a \"video game.\" These would not be appropriate for something to play while trying to take the lead. \n3. \"News article\" and \"card game\" are not relevant to the phrase and context, as they have nothing to do with a leading position. \n4. The action of playing small, folded papers implies some form of handwriting, such as a \"pencil.\" This means that the answer is B: video game\n\nInput: If I have a car and I drive to the hospital what kind of car do I drive? Choices:  C: ambulance D: cab E: van F: car\nOutput: The term \"kind\" is commonly interchangeable with the term \"type.\" Because a taxi is a type of car, the option is \"D: cab\". This is also reinforced by what kind of car is most likely to be used for transportation to the hospital. An ambulance is far more likely to be used for a medical emergency. Since a car is not what is most likely to be transporting a person to the hospital, the driver will most likely be using a cab or taxi. \"Type\" and \"kind\" would both be correct answers, so we may use \"kind\" in this case.\n\nInput: How do I describe the person who is happy when something negative is going on? Choices:  K: miserable L: elated M: cheerful N: sad\nOutput: \"happy\" is related to \"positive,\" as in \"feeling happy\" or being \"satisfied.\" Therefore the correct phrasing would be \"N: sad.\" \"The person is happy\" is an accurate description of the person. \"Happy\" in this context refers to positive emotions, such as feeling glad, delighted or ecstatic. The person described in this phrase is not feeling any such positive emotion and is, therefore, \"sad.\"\n\nInput: How can I describe it if I don't know what has happened?

Option C is the only option that would make sense in the context of a marmoset. They most likely come by planes or trains.\n5.) Option A is most likely wrong as it would be unlikely for a marmoset to go in the dictionary for several reasons.\n6.)

Choices: 1. A: Chess 2. B: Poker c: Go d: Monopoly e: Shogi\nOutput: 1.\"When playing a board game, can you move one piece vertically then move one piece into the center?\" is a problem asking about how to determine which type of game the person was playing. 2. It's easy to know that a standard chess game wouldn't require the type of action described in the problem and if you move vertically then move one into the center like this, one can easily identify that Poker, Go and Monopoly are out due to their mechanics (in no particular order).\n3. The problem now comes down to deciding which type of board game: Chess of Shogi. To do this, we should look at the properties each game has in common.\n4. Both Poker and Monopoly can be played by a group of people (there is usually a banker who deals the money in some way in poker but that is not the definition of game here), which is also true for Chess (if playing against a computer); it is a", "answer": "D: underground"}

The president address the capital and there he gives his state of union speech to the nation. Since the largest scale of speech we can think of in the capital is the one given by the president, it's best to select the answer choice that contains the word \"union\". \n4) The answer choice that contains \"union\" is ( D) \"each country's\" speech.

Option D \"your elbow\", E \"your lashes\" are not as relevant as expected because they do not seem to involve the entire body at once.\n4. If we do not think of anatomical parts separately but we need to focus on the entire body at once, as per the option given, the answer is C) \"falsies\".\n \n\n5.

{"idx": 787, "text": "1.\"Feel\" implies that the reader is referring to how someone feels over their situation, not what the situation might be.\n2. \"Abandoned\" refers to being left behind.\n3. It can be interpreted as someone being left by themselves after their marriage ended.\n4. Some of the word choices given seem to be related to feelings of 'abandonment' - as in, something that could be felt after one is abandoned.\n5. However, one has to choose from an option that would be more likely to be felt, since we are asked a question about what the person is likely to feel. \n6. Since the 'grief/solo/isolation' choices seem to be the closest to the context of abandonment, we can eliminate choices D, E.\n7. As for choice D, even if one feels \"grief\" over an incident, that doesn't necessarily indicate that \"gratitude\" is an emotion to feel towards that very incident.\n8. Similarly, B: \"solo\" might be felt towards being 'left behind' in some contexts, but it is not necessarily the most suitable choice given the context of the question.\n9. In the remaining choices, A \"grief\" and C \"abandonment\" seem like the most fitting options that the reader likely expects. The reader might be looking for an answer that would be more likely given the given context, which is why B, E are eliminated.\n10. Therefore, A and C are the only choices remaining.\n11. Out of the remaining two choices, A \"grieF\" would be more likely a feeling after being abandoned due to relationship breakdown, while C \"abandonment\", at a more general level, could indicate loneliness after relationship breakdown and perhaps other things.\n12. Since A is a more likely choice given the situation described by the question, it is the correct answer.\n13. Therefore, the correct answer is A: grief.\nSo the final explanation goes like this, \"Feel\" implies that... We are referring to how someone feels about their situation.... The person is abandoned by everyone and they are likely to feel...grief.", "answer": "C: isolation"}

In this question, the 'they' want to protect themselves against a cannon, so an item that would do so is required.\n2nd: Look for words/ phrases that makes sense using 'canon'. 'Ungulate' means \"a hoofed herbivorous mammal\", so it doesn't make sense here. 'Hat' means \"a close-fitting head covering, typically with a soft brim or crown\", so it doesn'tt make sense here.\n3rd: Look for a word/phrase with the prefix \"body\". An answer that would fit it would be 'body armour' or 'body suit'. Using the latter phrase, it is known that body suit is used in fighting and protects the user from damage, so it fits within the context.\n4th: Body armour doesn't mean the same as what the question asks. 'Tank' means \"a main battle tank; a very large armored military vehicle that carries soldiers and weapons and moves on land.\" It doesn't provide protection against a cannon.\n5th: 'Bomber' means \"an aircraft that is adapted for bombing\". So it is known that no bomber will provide direct protection against a shooting cannon (such that it will prevent a bullet from entering the body or stop the bullet from coming into contact with the body at all).\n6th: Out of all the given options, only 'body armour' matches the given context and therefore, is the correct answer.\nSo the final and the only answer is C: body armour\n\nInput: She doesn't have a high voice, what does the rest of the sentence convey?

{"idx": 847, "text": "1) The question relates to someone who is 'not happy to take their car'.\n2) 'Not happy' indicates that the choice isn't necessarily one that they love taking their car to, but it's an acceptable or less than ideal option, given its convenience.\n3) Considering this, they must have an option that takes priority over where else they might go and the choices that are being given would be better than that.\n4) 'Down river' would likely take a day (or longer) to get their car fixed and, as such, could be considered an 'off the beaten path' option and would likely only happen if the place to take the car was extremely impractical to take to.\n5) 'City' is a common location to take your car (especially if living outside of it), and, more importantly, one can typically take it anywhere they'd like in the city and not need to worry about getting there.\n6) 'Parking lot' would be a more realistic option to take your car compared to the other choices.\n7) 'The repair shop' would be the best location to take the car as it means you won't need to take it anywhere else afterwards, just for the sake of convenience.\n8) Therefore, the answer is C: Parking lot.\nSo the final conclusion is C: Parking Lot\n\nInput: What were the three words used to express a time frame?

But the fact that the seller is asking this indicates that the agent is probably trying to get the seller to trust him, not get the seller to exploit him as a greedy, gold-digging type of person. Which means he or she is probably trying to be a kind, caring, and pleasant person, especially when that's what you usually call nice people, \"nice\".\n2. However, in this context, the best definition of the word is, \"deceiving, especially by an attractive or seductive quality\", thus making deceiving the correct answer.\n3. Other options include charming, manipulating, exaggerating, and incompetence. But deceiving and charming are best suited for the given context.\n4. While we can conclude that most of the options describe how nice a person can be, the word \"charming\" implies being attractive or admirable in a particular way, so that people are inclined to take notice of a person and think well of them. On the other hand, \"deceiving\" implies misleading a person or intentionally making them believe something that is not true. \n5.

The first step is to understand the purpose of keeping account books. The choices provided for consideration don't exactly reflect the intended purpose, so they have to be eliminated. \n3. \"Kept at accountant\" doesn't exactly fit, as accountants deal in numbers and not accounts books.\n4. \"Purse\" is rather redundant in this context and doesn't serve any purpose here, so it can be eliminated. 5. Similarly, \"desk drawer\" doesn't reflect the intended purpose of storing an account book, so it can be ruled out.\n6. Therefore, we are left with options D: bank and E: keeping track of account book expenses; however, these options don't make sense, so we eliminate them as well.\n7. The only options that remain are A: kept at accounting firm and B: book shelf.\n8. The term 'Accounting firm' specifically refers to an organization that provides accounting services. So, this option can be disregarded; it isn't applicable to leaving an item behind.\n9.

{"idx": 991, "text": "The context indicates that \"John\" was probably given a jar which was not to his taste and was thus not happy about receiving it. This jar was made of plastic just like \"most of the stuff in the house\", indicating that many of the items in the house are made of plastic. John preferred glass, which suggests that he dislikes plastic.\nJohn has discontentment towards the plastic jar and is presumably wishing to be elsewhere in different circumstances.\nTherefore, John is likely wishing that he was in a different environment where he could change the house's material content/design to meet his preferences. \n1. The choices given are \"cupboard\" and \"garbage dump\".\nJohn is not interested in those two possibilities, suggesting that neither of those is his preferred location.\n2. John is nowhere else, so it is safe to assume that his preferred location is \"everything else\", although it has not been explicitly stated. The phrase \"anywhere else\" could be interpreted with its literal meaning or ambiguously, to mean another location rather than the environment mentioned in the statement. \n3. The only remaining option that indicates his preferred environment is \"own home\".\n4.

Therefore the remaining options, Bathroom and Hair Salon, are more viable alternatives for what the long hair would lead to.\n6. However, the two options are again not in a direct line when translated into the English language. \n7. A girl's long hair might lead her to wash it more often or use a better quality shampoo, but \"bathroom\" is neither a place to sleep", "answer": "D: own home"}

Choices:  grill: fire B: restaurant C: backyard D: crockpot E: barbeque (with a sauce)<n><n>#### Explanation<n><n>1.<n>answer C (implement) because it's the word that's being replaced by something more sophisticated.  The word being replaced by a noun describing things you clean by hand (A: hand,B: drain,C: dirt, etc.) <n><n>2.<n>answer D (in the woods)  because E (gas station), it's a more complicated word that refers to a place where we buy things (in a gas station).  D gets the letter C because C (bedroom) is another answer that fits, it's describing where small toys/trinkets are found, the same reasoning you used previously.<n><n>3.<n>answer C (university) because it's describing where people go to gain useful information, and you replace it by something more formal or institutional (A: college, B: school, C: university, D: library, E: museum).  A (backyard) can be used if you replace the last part of the riddle because it's describing fire (D: grilling).<n><n>4.<n>answer B (crookpot, crockpot) it isn't the most formal or appropriate way of describing a grill.  The replacement word we're looking for is used to describe other cooking methods ( A: microwave B: oven and C: stove D: grilling E: baking) so you replace it with a noun describing something that's less sophisticated that describes cooking.

What do you think you did wrong, and where do you think it was?<n><n>Answer: Lines 9 and 10 are equivalent. In English we say that it is redundant if you have a statement that says the same thing as its antecedent. A statement that is redundant still has meaning, and it also does not accomplish the same function as the antecedent.<n>Example: What are you doing? I am reading the book. This question is redundant, because the answer to the question is the same as the sentence containing the question. What are you doing? does not serve any purpose in this sentence and could be changed to I am reading the book<n><n>Answer: The instructions say you are writing a computer program in English to tell the user how to use a computer. I think, though, that this is being interpreted different across the country. I am from West Texas and never heard of the term ‘fancy’, but this is how I interpreted the question.<n><n>Answer: The statement in line 9 is redundant. You could leave it out and it wouldn't change any meaning in the sentence. <n><n>Answer: In the first question, we are determining the user's age from an input, so we would want to store this information somewhere so we can use later on in the program.<n><n>Answer: First program, I thought you were storing a boolean variable or a single character for each string. <n><n>Second program, I thought you stored a character based on the user's input with it possibly being capitalized. <n><n>Answer I thought it was unnecessary to use both if statements and the while loop, because a while loop will not exit on the first line of loop. <n><n>Answer Here I thought that using the if statement with two variables was not only unnecessary but confusing.

The 4th answer "appraises" the thing being measured but because it's only 5 letters in length, "a...praises" and "a...praisers" were ruled out. The 5th one "apriate" can mean "correctly suited to a particular use" which is also not what was asked so I got a little stuck. After a while though, I just added a word "implement" to "a...s" and it would have the extra 4 letters required that fit the bill. As for "b", well I got this on my 1st guess because I was thinking of "appartment" which is not what was asked for.)<n>B: Apparatus<n>C: Gas Station (Also note that even though this isn't correct, "gas" is capitalized in this sentence. I thought because the sentence was so simple and short, it would be a good chance to brush up on my capitalization skills)<n>D: Cabinet (Note: the "ap" sound from the end of the first answer gives the correct answer.)<n>E: Implement(This one is also a stretch and I could've gotten it from just payt attention to the context of the sentence, the question being "what" not "what" so it should be a singular noun with an "s", which, as I mentioned, "apparatus" is 8 letters so it's perfect. I couldn't quite remember though if it was "implem...it" or "implem..." so I just looked up the question online so I could learn that it has another "...ent" sound in there)<n>A: Apparatus(This one may feel easier than the last one but it was quite a bit

He washes all the windows. At lunchtime he goes home and takes a shower, puts on clean clothes and then goes back to work.

The woman is the same in almost every way, except on Monday mornings she sleeps until 9.30, watches a little television and then goes out to brunch with her friend before heading into work at 10.30am. She is a cleaner.  The man is an accountant. <n><n>Input: You can store information better if you can see it more often.

Choices:  The metre is a unit of measurement that is usually represented by a circle.  Units of measurement range in size from small (the inch), to large (the kilometre).  A unit of measurement is a way that we measure something we are interested in, in a standard way.  This is important, and one of the most important uses of units of measurement is, of course, currency: how much is a dollar worth?  A unit of measurement, however, can be a length (a foot), a weight (an ounce), an amount of time (a minute), or a surface area (an acre).  By comparing the weight of something to a standard unit, we can work out whether it is light, heavy, or just too much.  We can convert height to feet and inches, because we are so familiar with the metric system, where 100 centimetres equals one metre.  A metre is also another name for a mile: it is a unit of length, so there cannot help but be a number of miles in a metre, but what could possibly take the place of a mile?  In the imperial system, we have the mile, which is divided into 5280 feet, or into 30 inches.  That makes it about 1.609 kilometres, and that is a bit smaller than the metre, but in some contexts it can replace it.  How?  By making a little adjustment.  Now you have a metre in your hand, the problem is to figure out what it is.  Well, if you turn the metre backwards or sideways then you have something that is probably a little too big.  If you turn it around further, you now have something that is likely to be smaller than the metre.  And in fact, if you rotate the metre until you have a right angle in the shape

The vacuum cleaner<n>2. The washing machine<n>3. The dishwasher<n>4. The oven<n>5. The refrigerator<n><n>The "house" could even be considered the "house" of an average American, since it includes all of those machines that are typically in a house.<n><n>You might be thinking that I used the word "house" as a synonym for "home," but the correct answer, "A: burn hot," is the only answer that could fit both definitions.<n><n>"Burn hot" is used by itself to mean "to burn the fuel or a fuse." It's a reference to the burning of hot fuel in cars, in which cars run on petrol (or gasoline, natural gas, methane, diesel fuel, etc.)<n>When you burn hot, you generally use a fuse, which you can find "burning hot" (burning).<n>This is a reference to the furnace or incandescent bulb in a house, which may burn at night (at night).<n><n>If what is being gained is "expensive," where do you get it? At school.<n>The correct answer, "A," references learning/studying at university, which is also expensive.<n><n>"C:" is a clear reference to California, where wine is typically grown using the large, light, green grapes of the vineyards found in that region of the world.<n><n>You might even refer to someone as "thick" if his or her knowledge of something is poor, which may or may not be a true reference to the fact that "thick" grapes are found in California.<n><n>"E:" has nothing to do with the rest of the questions, but, as the only possible answer, it is the correct one.<n><n>### Source: [MIT BS 226 Final](http://mit.ir/bs200final.pdf)

Short term memory, 2. Long term memory.<n><n>## Short term memory<n><n>Short-term memory lasts from a few seconds to 30 minutes. You may remember a telephone number of a song played a few hours ago. Short-term memory helps us store information we’re trying to recall but it lacks permanent storage so important information has to be written down onto paper or else it is stored in the long term memory.<n><n>Long term memory<n><n>Long-term memory holds information for years, months or even years if necessary. There is an unlimited amount of capacity. This is why we are able to remember things we have heard a long time ago. For long-term memory one of the most important things to do is to put the information into a mnemonic. Mnemonic is a story a rhyme or a sentence that helps students remember information.<n>

My first time going through the questions I got half of them right.<n><n>Solution 2:<n>For this solution, I thought of using the brute force method; but I also thought of having the program cycle through until it gets a match. But again I couldn't understand if that was correct. I then thought of having the code cycle through the options until it comes to something it understands( in this case a word). Once I do that it should cycle through until it finds all the options, and give a match based on that.<n><n>Solution:<n>I thought of doing the same thing the previous solution did, but using an array to do the cycle, I got most of the same right answers in test run, and I felt good because I didn't want to just use brute force.<n><n>### Implementation<n><n>This is how I implemented the question 2 and 4, after thinking if there is a better solution to brute force.<n>```<n>// 1.

Input: Fabric is cut […]<n><n>Answer: The answer must be `E`.<n><n>Anthony Bui, from Stack Overflow, answered why `E` is the correct option: it's a hardware store.<n><n>We have to understand the sentence, `where are you if your reading magazine while waiting for a vehicle?`. From this, we can guess that we are in a waiting room somewhere. Reading a magazine, therefore, is something people do in waiting rooms.<n><n>Next, we would assume that a vehicle would be a train from its relation to the text about magazines.<n><n>Finally, we can infer that a hardware store is probably where we have to go if we are waiting for a train.<n>

Choices:  A: department store B: school C: garden D: office building E: house<n>Output:		B: school<n> <n>---<n><n>What are the common meanings of "I'll have ___ with a ___"? <n>Chances are you've heard this expression a hundred times or more, uttered by you or someone in your company, at a gathering with family, at parties, or at any other time. <n><n>The phrase has a few different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. <n>While it is often used when ordering food, it has nothing to do with actually getting food. <n><n>For example, when a diner makes a list of orders, they might say something like "I'll have the fish with spaghetti." In this case, the "I" is referring to the person placing the order, while the "fish" refers to the main item being ordered, and "spaghetti" is what that item will be eaten with.<n><n>In some countries, the phrase is used almost exclusively when ordering food in a restaurant. But it is also used in this fashion in several other situations. The literal meaning is the same as when making food orders –  it means I want this item with this other item. "I'll have an ice cream cone with a milkshake" would mean "I want to order an ice cream cone and a milkshake at the same time", for example.<n><n>While the phrase has nothing to do with order-taking, it does share a link with another time-honored tradition – taking money. In olden days, the person taking an order for a diner or bar would then take money. They were not actually giving the diner the money, but telling them, "I'll have some money with this order". It was an indirect way of saying this person is responsible for bringing the dish/food back to his table, and you'll have this money with me when the bill comes.<n><n>You've probably been told this by restaurant owners and bartenders over the years. If you have, then you are one of the many who have been left with this unanswerable question: Where did this expression actually come from? Here are answers to two related questions.<n><n>"What are the common meanins of 'I'll have ____ with a ____'?"<n>"What are the origins of 'I' have ____ with a____"?

De Morgan's laws is used to simplify boolean expressions, like for example let:<n>```<n>if (a || false) === a ||!false<n><n>if (a && false) === a &&!false<n>```<n>2. Now if you look at the logic of (a || false) it can be written as (absence of a) and presence of false, so the above simplified expression can be rewritten as:<n>```<n>if presence absence of a<n>```<n>3. Now, if we want to simplify presence of a, we can use the same technique and simplify it to:<n>```<n>if a<n>```<n>4. So now if we put it all together, we have:<n>```<n>==> if (a) === (absence of a && presence of false)<n>==> which simplifies to:<n>==> (inverted a || false)<n>==> So, we can conclude that presence of a is equal to inverted a or false<n>```<n>So, this is how De Morgan's Laws simplifies and helps us solve boolean expressions in boolean algebra.<n>### Solution and Explanation-part 2<n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.<n>Output:<n>```<n>I have tried all types of food I could find as long as I am given food.<n>```<n>### Instruction<n><n>1.

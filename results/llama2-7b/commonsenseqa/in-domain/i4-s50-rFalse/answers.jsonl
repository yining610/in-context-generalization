Choices:  a: tennis b: scrabble c: darts,  d: twister e: chess\nOutput: b: scrabble\n```\n\n## Solution:\n\n- Part 1: This problem is using 0 and 43 (62-20), since 62 divided by 43 does not give remainder, it must contain all the numbers, thus 62.\n- Part 2: This part is trying to test the logic, not trying to see how much information can be extracted. The output for the 2nd test case is A: hockey game because it is a sport. I tried doing a bit of pattern matching as well:\n\n  ```python\n    import re\n    import numpy as np\n    if input == \"part two boxers\":\n      return re.sub(r'part (two (boxers?))',\"part two boxers\",\"part two boxers\")\n  ```\n\n  10/10 would recommend for your high school math project.\n\n- Part 3: 300 - 900 = 600, 600 contains 300 -500 = 100, therefore the answer would be 300. I've been getting a lot of 0 when trying to extract the number of digits at this point.\n\n- Part4: The question is asking what kind of breathing, therefore when the input is sigh, we will choose A.\n\n- Part5: This question gives you some hints. The answer would be New York, because the only city in which one can play this is NYC, the output has some hints as well:\n\n\n```python\nIf you say Bill is stuck in the marsh, what two cities can you think of?(carnival)\n```\n\n- Part6: What game can be played with only two players? Since the game is scrabble, there must be two players, and that's it. The logic of the input should be something similar to this:\n\n\n```\nWhere do humans go in cities, to be in nature?\n\nWhat do you wear on the brige of your nose?\n\nBill is stuck in the marh, when a man comes", "answer": "D: louisiana"}

A: During the meal B: At the beginning of the meal\nOutput: A: During the meil\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFor each question, we must try to find a rule by which we could map an input to a unique output. For example, the question \"Where do humans go in cities...\" can be mapped to question \"Which kind of breathing makes?\" in which there are only 3 possible inputs (choices A, B, C) and 1 possible output (choice D).\n\nIn most examples, this is fairly straightforward. However, often, there are other questions that can be used to rule out the choices that do not map to the corresponding statements. For example,\n```\nInput: Which is smaller, a fish tank or pond? Choices:  c. fish tank d. pond\nOutput: d. pond\n\nInput: Which kind of breathing makes you sick? Choices: a. sigh b. yawn c. cough d. clavicular\nOutput: a. sigh\n```\nThe rule in this case is that a sigh is a question about breathing that does not imply that you are sick. The other questions map to the statement that imply you are sick, ie. breathing that is a question that indicates you are sick, like a cough. The cough maps to the statement that indicates you are sick and the other questions simply rule out that the statement is about being sick.\n\nSo in our case above, we need to figure out if", "answer": "C: money"}

{"text": "A: choose one\n\n### Instructions:Write a function called findDifferences(twoArrays) that determines which array does not equal the other array. This program should return two arrays \u2013 the original two arrays and another array that indicates the difference between the arrays. You\u2019ll have to use a for loop to scan through both arrays to determine which array is different from the other.\n\nInput: What does the word'march' indicate? Choices:  'A': that time of year where you march 'B': that time of year when you march 'C': that time of year we march  'D': the time of year we march\nOutput: D: the time of year we murch\nIn this exercise, you created a function in the form of a for loop. A for loop is a standard looping construct used to repeat a specific block of code. For loops execute the code contained within the block repeatedly until a specific condition is met. A for loop has four components:\nVariable declaration: The first component of a for loop is the variable declaration. The variable declaration declares the variable that will be used to track values while the code is iterating. Variables can be either scalar or array variables.\nInitialization expression: The next component is the initialization expression, which, like a declaration, must be placed in parentheses. This is the first value your for loop will execute, and it assigns the value to your variable.\nTest condition: The test condition is the condition used to stop the loop. For each iteration of the loop, the loop body will execute unless the condition evaluates to false. The loop body is the body of the code that contains the instructions that will be executed; this is usually inside the parentheses.\nIncrement expression: The final component of the for loop is the increment expression, which is a mathematical expression used to increment the for loop variable by 1 after each iteration of the loop. This is the expression used to increment your variable\u2019s value.\n\n### Instruction:Write a function called isBossy that takes an array of strings or objects as input. The array of objects should contain one array of names, with the name \u201cBossy\u201d in the array as the first element. The function should determine if any string in the second array matches the string \u201cBossy\u201d and if so, return the string as output.\n\n#### The Code 1:\n```\nfunction isB", "answer": "D: learn to read"}

You always have an opportunity to improve your skills and become a master, and the way you do this is by overcoming greater challenges. A person finds the answers based on their own ideas.\n\nInput: Fun is subjective.

Then recursively, start from the bottom tree, if the left child is not null we will use it, then we will get the head of the left child (1) and right child (2) to get the sub-tree of the left child (4).\nOnce we get the sub-tree, we will check if the head of the sub-tree is equal to the head of a path and if it is return the value of it.\n              0x04  // 01 1   2   3\n              0x05 1  // 0x0011   2\n              0x06 3  // 0x 3333   2\n\nOnce we got the sub-tree, the function return 3 which is 3 as the left child and 3 as the right child.\n \nNext, we will traverse up the parent node using a Queue, when we get the", "answer": "C: united states"}

Choices:  a: tennis b: scrabble c: darts,  d: twister e: chess<n>Output: b: scrabble<n>```<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>- Part 1: This problem is using 0 and 43 (62-20), since 62 divided by 43 does not give remainder, it must contain all the numbers, thus 62.<n>- Part 2: This part is trying to test the logic, not trying to see how much information can be extracted. The output for the 2nd test case is A: hockey game because it is a sport. I tried doing a bit of pattern matching as well:<n><n>  ```python<n>    import re<n>    import numpy as np<n>    if input == "part two boxers":<n>      return re.sub(r'part (two (boxers?))',"part two boxers","part two boxers")<n>  ```<n><n>  10/10 would recommend for your high school math project.<n><n>- Part 3: 300 - 900 = 600, 600 contains 300 -500 = 100, therefore the answer would be 300. I've been getting a lot of 0 when trying to extract the number of digits at this point.<n><n>- Part4: The question is asking what kind of breathing, therefore when the input is sigh, we will choose A.<n><n>- Part5: This question gives you some hints. The answer would be New York, because the only city in which one can play this is NYC, the output has some hints as well:<n><n><n>```python<n>If you say Bill is stuck in the marsh, what two cities can you think of?(carnival)<n>```<n><n>- Part6: What game can be played with only two players? Since the game is scrabble, there must be two players, and that's it. The logic of the input should be something similar to this:<n><n><n>```<n>Where do humans go in cities, to be in nature?<n><n>What do you wear on the brige of your nose?<n><n>Bill is stuck in the marh, when a man comes

My first instinct was to write a solution in pandas and use a merge to combine the vectors. The merge resulted in the values being switched on the 8 test values. The solution I came up with was to use np.where with a list comprehension instead. I then used np.nonzero() to get indices of what rows contain no true values and np.where() to get indices of rows with false values after which I used np.where() again to extract the data from each row. I struggled a little bit to come up with a format that worked for the test data.<n>

This program should return two arrays – the original two arrays and another array that indicates the difference between the arrays. You’ll have to use a for loop to scan through both arrays to determine which array is different from the other.<n><n>Input: What does the word'march' indicate? Choices:  'A': that time of year where you march 'B': that time of year when you march 'C': that time of year we march  'D': the time of year we march<n>Output: D: the time of year we murch<n>In this exercise, you created a function in the form of a for loop. A for loop is a standard looping construct used to repeat a specific block of code. For loops execute the code contained within the block repeatedly until a specific condition is met. A for loop has four components:<n>Variable declaration: The first component of a for loop is the variable declaration. The variable declaration declares the variable that will be used to track values while the code is iterating. Variables can be either scalar or array variables.<n>Initialization expression: The next component is the initialization expression, which, like a declaration, must be placed in parentheses. This is the first value your for loop will execute, and it assigns the value to your variable.<n>Test condition: The test condition is the condition used to stop the loop. For each iteration of the loop, the loop body will execute unless the condition evaluates to false. The loop body is the body of the code that contains the instructions that will be executed; this is usually inside the parentheses.<n>Increment expression: The final component of the for loop is the increment expression, which is a mathematical expression used to increment the for loop variable by 1 after each iteration of the loop. This is the expression used to increment your variable’s value.<n><n>### Instruction:Write a function called isBossy that takes an array of strings or objects as input. The array of objects should contain one array of names, with the name “Bossy” in the array as the first element. The function should determine if any string in the second array matches the string “Bossy” and if so, return the string as output.<n><n>#### The Code 1:<n>```<n>function isB

(1)<n><n>There are two answers to this question, because some people believe fun is defined by the player. One person found two common things that you need to have fun while playing games. The first common thing you might find is "suspense or uncertainty". For example, there might be some level of suspense throughout the story or game, where you can't anticipate what's going to happen next. The second common thing you might find in a game is "unlimited challenge". You always have an opportunity to improve your skills and become a master, and the way you do this is by overcoming greater challenges. A person finds the answers based on their own ideas.<n><n>Input: Fun is subjective.

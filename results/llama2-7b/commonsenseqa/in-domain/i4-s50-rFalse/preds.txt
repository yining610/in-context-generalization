If we eliminate choices A: ‘allergic reaction’, B: ‘gain weight’, C: ‘have fun’ and D: ‘heartburn’. Then we are left with E: ‘food poisoning’. <n><n>## What is your name?<n><n>### Step1:  Let’s try to answer the question using the process of elimination where we eliminate options A: ‘allergies’, B: ‘heart attack’, C: ‘headache’, D: ‘food poison’.

Now we must use  another method as the process of elimination didn’t work so now it’s time to use logic to think up the answer. We know that ‘blood clots are bad’.  The correct answer is ‘clots’ but the response is ‘clots and blood clots’.  We have the answer but the response is wrong.<n><n>### I have a hard time answering the questions so I’ll try another method..<n>#### I’ll use another method.<n>#### Let’s try to use the same process by saying A: ‘allergynot’ and B: ‘heart attack not’. <n><n>#### But let’s find something different than those.<n><n><n>

It also calls a sub program `print_instruction` that takes a string, and passes it on as a parameter to print. It also has a `read_ans` subroutine that inputs from the user, the name of the option that the user would like to write.<n> <n>#### User input and subroutine calls<n>This program starts with `answer_question` and prints the question asked. It then inputs a choice and checks if that choice is found in the array and returns the choice. Then it executes other subroutine functions such as print_instruction, which prints the instruction and uses the prompt function. We also use `read_ans` to input the users answers and return it as a string.<n> <n>#### Printing to the console<n>This program uses the print function, passed the parameter the string, which is where it will display the output on the console to the user. We call the function `print` and pass it the parameter, which is the string to print. The output will be displayed using the function `print`and then the function `wait` waits for the user.<n> <n>

Choices:  A: building B: office C: library D: table E: bathtub<n><n>### Response:		I wanted  a side chair. A building is where a building is. A building is not in a library. A building is not on a table. A city is on a road. But a city is not a building. So what does this mean? A bathtub is not a side chair. So a building is not a table. In the case of a table, you may want to take care to avoid having to go to the bathroom so often. A bathtub, however, would be good if you were already in the bathroom. So, a bathtub would be a great place to sit if you knew it had been cleaned. Another option might be to use the library for the library. You could have the library at the library. <n><n><n>### Input : what is the name for a word that may be found on a menu?<n><n>### Demonsration:<n>The answer: menu<n><n>### Response<n>There is a word called "menu."  <n><n>### Input<n>Would it be better to say, "what is the name for a menu?"<n><n>### Demosration<n><n>The answer: It would be very bad in your eyes.<n><n>### Response <n>A menu is a list of options for what you want to eat.<n><n>### Input <n>Does it matter how I ask the question? <n><n>### Demotion<n><n>The answer:"It doesn't matter where you go. <n><n>### Response :<n>I can eat whatever I want to at a place called a restaurant. If I go to the restaurant, I can eat whatever I want. If I have 3 hours to spare, I can go to the grocery store. If I have 0 hours to spare, I will have to get in the car. If I don't get my butt kicked, I will have to buy more food.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>A menu is a menu. I cannot choose what is on a menu. A person is the only who decides what to choose from the menu. If you get too many people making too many decisions over time, you will end up making decisions for yourself that may make things a little difficult for you<n><n>---<n><n>### Credit:<n>This solution created by [John-Luc Vandalon](https://github.com/jlucv) on [g

Choices:  A: movie theatre B: university C: park D: alaska E: country<n>Answer: C: park<n><n>Input: The referee called a foul when one player punched another.  The player went to the penalty box.

Choices:  A: scar B: tunnel C: transportation system D: spectacles E: stringed instrument<n>Answer: D: spectacles<n><n>### Input:John loves animals and he hates animal abuse.  Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n><n>### Response:		C: He would avoid being in the park.  Some places do not allow animals.  The pet shop allows pet sales and this could result in animal abuse. Also, pet stores that sell animals that are supposed to be pets are not as safe as just letting dogs take care of themselves.  Pet stores, like all animal warehouses, are stressful.  Not only this but having animals on your person is stressful.  When your going to an unfamiliar place, you might not find where you are or you may not have the knowledge of finding your way back.  On top of that, animal smell is also very unpleasant.  It is the same as an old schoolyard, but there is no smell in school.  The park is a place for wild animals so the animals may want to go there too.  It is in a wilderness, which is not meant to have humans present.  It is also important to note that the dog park is only for dogs.  Dogs are not supposed to interconnect with humans.  Last but not least, dogs may be in danger at the dog park.<n><n>### Input Where is it safe to play music? Choices: A: grocery store B: restaurant C: airplane D: living room E: park<n><n>In order to play a musical instrument, you need a private place and the best place to practice would be in your house.  Playing in public places can be a distraction to people in the neighborhood.  There is also a risk of hurting someone by playing loudly in their home and disrupting them from their daily routine.  The most obvious noise that comes from an instrument is your own voice while singing which is annoying.  Lastly, the most important reason is privacy.  You do not want people to see the instrument you are practicing with.  It might be embarrassing and hurt your self esteem.<n>

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: chemist's shop C: kitchen D: drug store E: bedroom<n><n>### Response:		E E: bedroom<n>### Explanation: Birth control pills are classified as medicine, not toothpaste. If you are looking for something in your medicine cabinet, you will probably be looking in the bathroom which is a room in our home that is usually located in the upstairs. The kitchen is located in a different part of the home. The bedroom is just off of there. The kitchen may contain aspirins, cough medicine and other medicines. The bedroom would probably not contain any medicine shelves, like the medicine cabinet in the bathroom, but it surely would contain toothpaste! Therefore, I think that the correct response is "E: bedroom".<n><n>#### Expected response: E<n>

Choices:  A: finish line B: broken bones C: broken legs D: chapped lips E: healthy body<n><n>### Response:		What might be the result of seasons skiing?  I think that broken bones could be the result of a long time of practice skiing.  Skiers also have to be in good physical condition to do a race or competency.  To train for a long time and keep up that stamina they would probably have to ski a lot.  Skiers sometimes get chapped lips, that is true, but usually those lips belong to beginners and not experts.  I don't think chapped lips is an issue for an expert skier.<n><n>This solution will need to be updated for the future. <n><n>

Choices: <n>Answer:C: boiling water<n><n>### This is the third line of the instruction.<n><n>To help you understand how best to answer this problem it helps to read the problem statement again and try to identify keywords. (The first keyword that jumps out in the first example is nature. The referee called a �foul�, �players�, �penalty box�, and �penalty� are related to sports. Sigh and soccer do not relate to sporting events. The only thing in common in the question is nature.) <n><n>To write a code to solve this question we need to use the keyword "question". (Other keywords to consider are "answer", "input",  "output", "number", "option", and "choice".)<n><n>In computer science you will often be asked a series of questions in a programming language called *quizzes*. The answers to the questions will be the input to the code. That means you will need to use the keyword question.<n><n>The input to the code will be the questions that need to be answered together with the questions they match, which are called options. For this problem you only provided answers for two of the five questions. If you had provided answers for the other three questions, the instructions would be "question", input:"", options: ", " and output:".<n><n>When you code for a quiz you will need to create a loop, which will provide a choice for each question. The loop will need to be inside the input section, because the questions are required inputs to the code.<n>

Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n><n>### Response:		You can exercise without sweating at all. However, when I sweat, I am working off energy. There is no other answer.

However, it is a great place to live and work.  It is the perfect beach vacation destination.  We've been going here for years.  What it has has always been the sandy beach that makes it awesome and of course the great people.  I also love the fact that you can rent a bike and ride alongside the beach in the Gulf Coast National Seashore area.

But like if it was landscaping or building of a house I would guess that would not be a construction site since it is not a road of a street. It is a bridge between a structure that needs to built and the foundation of the building. But maybe the foundation of the building is just a simple pole holding it together.<n><n>* It is up to the person to pick where the archeological dig is on the list of places they are asking about.

From the question, I can’t figure that country is which one out of choices because I found the first two questions that I asked are about USA and I want to answer questions quickly so I choose country that I know most of American history and that is “United States”.<n>The first question is about the park and  I think park is the correct answer because humans usually when they want to escape from city they go to the park, but the park is not the only choice they can go there because this world is different and it’s changing. For example city is growing day after day and city is different than village which the village is less crowded than city. So, there is no sure that humans go to park because of humans the park is also in village and the question can be that question can be changed. So, they can change the question to “Where do humans go in villages to be in nature?” and the answer can be different than park, because humans go to park when they go to a city.<n>Second question is about the foot ball and the first answer is yes, because the game is related to the football game where the ball is thrown in the goal and if it hits to the penalty box that person goes to the goal and the second answer is no, because they didn’t say what the game is they only said the foot ball. My other answer is yes in the sense the game is related to football but not the true the game is different from the soccer game.<n>The third question is about the clavicular and the answer is not because the question is related to the clavical when the clavicular muscle is tight if they play a card they will show pain in clavical.<n>The fourth question is not true because the question is related about the spectacles and if you wear a spectacle it won’t make any sound and the first answer is the correct answer of the question.<n>Finally, the last question is about the boredom and I can say that the correct answer is the first answer because

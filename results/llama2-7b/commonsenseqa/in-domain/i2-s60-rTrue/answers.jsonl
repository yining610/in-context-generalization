{"text": "We can easily establish that only Answer Choice C has been validated to be correct.\n\n#### Conceptualization of connection to a computer network\nThe terms connection & data communication are analogous to and interchangeable with the terms link, channel, circuit, or line. These words and their use are almost identical in the world of both computer networking and telephony. A connection is also referred to as a network link.\n\n#### What the Connection term refers to\n- Connection refers to the physical connection or channel between 2 communication devices, such as computers or telephone systems, that are transmitting data or voice signals.\n\n\n## Data communication, or transmission, is the process of transporting data between data terminals or from one data terminal for use by another data terminal. Data terminals can be people or computers that can use the information transmitted over the data link.\n\n#### Types of connections\nData communications connections, also called logical link connections, refer to the logical links or connections where data communications occur. There are 3 types of physical network connections that make data communication connections possible:\n- Point-to-point connection\n- Line connection\n- Network connection\n\n#### Examples\nHere are a list of different types of connections we are familiar with:\n- LAN (Local Area Network)\n- WAN (Wide Area Network)\n- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)\n\n#### Point -to -point data communications connections:\n- A point -to -point connection allows 2 devices, computers, or workstations to be connected and communicate with each other. This type of connection is also known as a direct communication connection.\n- A point-to-point connection uses a single cable or wireless pathway to connect 2 devices.\n- A device on one end, known as a transmitter, sends data to the other end of the connection, called a receiver.\n- Each end of a point-to-pointconnection has its own interface card for the devices to plug into and transmit/receive data.\n\n#### Line connections:\n- A line connection is also known as the physical communication connection. With a line connection, 2 or more devices can be connected and communicate over a specific network, or pathway with 2 or more networked devices (such as a hub or switch) involved.\n\n#### The difference between line and point-to-point data communications connections", "answer": "D: computer network"}

They had two different sets of materials, and Jill had one more hand than John. What was the probability that they could build a bridge 6 feet long and 3 feet wide?\n### Output\n- First, divide 42 (4 hours) by 4 (a total of 2 hands), then divide 2 by 2. This is how you can convert the hands and hours in the problem to more straightforward concepts.\n- Then, find the probability of drawing out the materials using an equation. For any event, there is an expression given to help determine the probability of the event. It includes the chance of getting the event in a particular order.\nIn probability, this is called the multiplication principle: multiply the chances of each possible outcome where the numbers are assigned to each outcome and the expression will give a particular event.\n- Afterward, multiply 12*11 as Jill is giving 11 cards and John is giving 12.\n- In this case, Jill is able to divide 2 between 22 possibilities, which equals 1/11.

{"text": "If I had a jar of this sort, I would be more likely to put it in the pantry, since we already know that it is likely to spoil if not stored in a cool place. The pantry is the ideal place for the refrigeration, and so if I choose to save it, I would be quite likely to place it in the kitchen pantry.\n\n### Why\nThe grocery store is not an option, as it is more relevant to items which are bought frequently compared to food items that are bought in lesser quantities. Similarly, storing the item in the refrigerator is not practical, since there is no guarantee that the fridge will be available when I am ready to eat. \n\n### Why not\nThe grocery shop is not a good place to keep the jar of food which does not last long, and so the answer is not grocery shop. Similarly, storage in the refrigerators is not recommended.\n\n### What's a pantry? \nA pantry is a section of a kitchen where groceries are stored. It is a compartment where grains, cooking oils, etc can be kept. It is not a permanent store where the stuff is kept as in the fridge. A refrigerator is the compartment where the food items such as milk or eggs are to be stored.\n\n### Write a response that appropriates completes the request. \nIn this question, we were asked to tell where I would put a jar of food, which was likely to spoiled if left out of the fridge.\n\n### DETAILS\nThe detail is that I have a jar of food, kept in the kitchen but will be out of refrigeration for more than a couple of hours,  will spoil. We already know this, otherwise the question would not make sense.\n\nWe don't know, where to look for a fridge that is ready to be used, and there are several such instances, where the refrigerator will be in use, not necessarily in use by the person asking the question; and so, the person can't be asked to store the jar safely, which is the point of the question itself.\n\nThe grocery is not an option, since a lot of the food items we buy like groceries are in bags of their own, and", "answer": "E: refrigerator"}

Persistence is a mental and behavioral characteristic that refers to an individual's ability to persist in a task, especially in the face of obstacles, and can lead to improved productivity, problem-solving abilities, and task completion.\n2. Better book refers to having a higher level of knowledge than another person, implying that this option does not satisfy the given condition.\n3. More knowledge is irrelevant since the given option indicates that one must have the right book to know something.\n4. Better tools does not necessarily mean being efficient at work since using the best tools doesn't necessarily help in improving the work.\n5. More work refers to the sheer quantity of work that may not guarantee effective completion of tasks as well.\n6. Hence, the correct answer is A: persistence.\n\n### Answer:\nChoice A: Persistence\n\n### Explanation:\nTo work efficiently, one must have persistence so they can overcome obstacles while working and ensure that they are able to effectively complete a set of tasks in a short period of time.\n\n```\n{\n\"id\": \"9\",\n\"category\": \"c_5\",\n\"title\": \"Which item below has the same length as 30?\",\n\"options\": [\n  \"50\",\n  \"60\",\n  \"81\"\n],\n\"answer\": \"60\",\n\"accepted\": true\n}\n```\n\n```\n{                \n\"id\": \"2\",\n\"category\": [\n    \"c_11\",\n    \"c_44\",\n    \"c\"\n],\n\"title\": \"Choose the option that is the same number of letters as a)\",\n\"question\": \"What is the same number of words as\",\n\"question2\": \"How many of words are in\",\n\"options\":[\n    \"Bernice\",\n    \"Cat\",\n    \"Dingo\"\n],\n\"options2\":[\n    \"", "answer": "C: have tools"}

In other words: a correct (and properly elaborated) instruction first, then a demo, then answer, then question. I expect a response of (probably) this type because it follows a natural flow of teaching and has very clear and helpful rationales. \n\n### Rationale:\n\nInput: How many men went on the boat?\n\nAnswer: Eight\n\nIn this case, I feel as though the question is not clear. It almost sounds as though the number of men on the boat are the problem or the challenge? Or the result of some other action?\n\nIt would make more sense for the question to be: How many men went out in the boat? The question is clearly stated, but the explanation of what went on in the boat would require us to know what the boat is doing on the sea. Without a more clear and logical explanation of the situation, I believe that the question is not as clear as it is meant to be.\n\nIt would be difficult, almost impossible, to answer this question based on what is given. One would have to assume that because 4 men got into the boat, the last 3 did not, and then that 7 men in the boat were all men? Why isn't there one less man if it was 3-7 with a total of 8 altogether? Then if you figure 7 men came out and there is supposed to be 3 left in the boat?\n\nIt's a good question, but not very clear. I would ask a more specific question that was clearer.\n\n# Part 2: Answers to Exercises\n\n1. The question is about the time of the year that a boat would leave its moor as well as the number of men that went out, and the number that came back. From this, we can assume that 3 came back.

{"text": "1. This is the place for electric fan.\n         This question gives students choice to explain answer\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question describes the situation, and then suggests additional details that must be included, hence the response should focus on the detail(s) given in the question.\n2. We know the people who like temperatures 'cool' have electric fans, but we don't know where.\n3. The question therefore asks the reader to consider the additional details provided.\n4. The question suggests that the person has more than one electric fan. This can refer to one house having more than one fan per person or for one person having more than one fan.\n5. By asking'might', the question leaves it open for either option (one person or one house).\n6. Therefore, the more logical answer is E: multiple fans.\n7. This allows us to determine which location an electric fan at home and multiple fans at home would be the best answer.\n8. While the answer for one person (D: hot room) is true, it doesn't take into account that this person will have electric fans in multiple places.\n9. The choice C: home refers to one person, and therefore isn't the best answer for the situation described in the question.\n10. Since'more than one' is indicated in the question, we'll consider this scenario, so choosing E: multiple fans allows us to choose B: hardware store and A: home.\n    \n### Input:What's in the box?

{"text": "Input: \nThe task asks which action is taken to attach something to a board.\n\nOutput:\nPotential actions for this task include nailing or carving. Nailing is a type of fastening used to strengthen structure, whereas carving is the process of sculpting. \n\n#### Attempt 1:\n1. We need to know what is nailed to the board to answer this question.\n2. Carving is not an option because it doesn't specify the outcome of the object that will be nailed to the board.\n3. Eating cake is unlikely, as it's not necessary for fastening and would not provide the same level of structure to the object like nailing would.\n4. Petrifying isn't relevant either because it wouldn't affect the way the object is nailed, only the object itself.\n5. The remaining choices are A: nailed and B: carved.\n6. A: nailed is the only logical option because it describes how to attach something to a structure and is the only relevant answer.\n\n### Response 2:\nInput: 1. There are several potential actions, including nailing, using adhesives (such as glue) or even using a hammer and screwdriver.\n2. For this answer, you need to decide which action is most specific to the question.\n\nOutput: 1. Consider which action is most in line with the question.\n2. The primary action referred to in the question is nailing.\n3. Adhesives are not used to nail something onto a board; they are used to keep two separate things together.\n4.

Choice B: emotonal distress is not likely to happen after telling many people about an incident.

{"text": "This answer does not appear to answer the question appropriately based on the following:\n\n1. The question asked if someone dislikes learning to change it, not to stop it.\n2. Aside from the option A: interesting, none of the choices have any connection to learning whatsoever. This doesn't demonstrate that the person who dislikes learning knows what learning is and how it would affect them personally.\n3. If someone dislikes learning, learning is going to come up in a negative connotation anyway, which would likely turn away most of the people who'd even consider answering this question.\n\n4. The option A: interesting and B: fun are the same only in a different order, which is also pointless.\n\n5. The learning process isn't a process someone dislikes to help make learning 'interesting,' it's one the entire world needs to change if someone dislikes it.\n\n6. It wasn't even about education to start with; it's about learning in general.\n\n7. The options C: joyful or D: very important, however, do not address what the question or statement asked for.\n\n8. Instead, they both give a different connotation to the same thing the question is asking.\n\n9. In essence, the question asked about learning itself, not about education.\n\n10. Therefore, the option E: free doesn't give a possible option for the answer.\n\n11. The reason is because learning doesn't have to be expensive unless it needs to be, which is only when it comes to a school system.\n\n\n### Input:(A: How many boys will be at the beach this week?)

{"text": "1. This question describes, through a list of options, an instance in which children are bored.\n2. The options can be either of two things: a verb, or a description of an action.\n3. Walk isn't a boredom alleviating action, smell smoke isn't an action at all, reach over is probably not a verb.\n4. Therefore, the answer would be a verb.\n5. The verb should describe an action children are likely to do if they are boring during a specific situation.\n6. The situation here is boredom.\n7. Therefore the verb should be an action children do when they are bored.\n8. Actions can be of two types: the type of the action does not matter but the action should not be an already boring action i.e. the boring action should be different than the 'boring'.\n9. According to this: 7 options are:\n10. We have to find the type of action among the options. \n11. The options can be categorized by the type of actions they are:\n\nVerb of boredom action: 1: play tag\nVerb of boring: 2: change shoe\n\nSo, from the two, the logical option is 2: change shoes because it fits as 'action while being boring' in case when children are bored. So the correct answer would be 2: change shoes.\n\n### Input\nThe dog chewed what?

{"text": "The man in this situation owned a car and lived in a city. The choices listed describe possible ways to relate having a car to the man's experience. As such, we can infer that being asked this question means that the teacher would like us to choose the option that best fits the context of the man's example. Let's start by eliminating any choices that are inconsistent or irrelevant. Choice D: parking garages doesn't make much sense because being in the city (and in parking garages) often requires driving the car. Choices A: driveway and B: the event are also eliminated by the same reason. Choice C: scrap heap is possible since it happens in real life, but it doesn't make sense in the context of the example because there's nothing about the man's commute that implies he would end up breaking down in any way.

{"text": "The answer to the given question is, most certainly, not a \"Spinning Wheel.\"\n\n### Rationale:\n1. \"Spinning Wheels\" are known structures, not something that is commonly referred to as a \"Wheel with a Handle to Spin.\"\n2. The given answer choice \"spinning wheel\" does not match the \"it's broken\" part of the given.\n3. The structure of a \"Spinning wheel\" is a wheel, not someone (person), so it wouldn't make sense for someone to \"lay with their leg on it.\"\n4. \"To lay\" refers to the position of someone in a horizontal position on the ground. That is why we \"lay down\" to sleep or \"lay down on\" a comfy chair or cot.\n5. The \"on\" indicates that the person (a human/pet) is on something.\n6. Therefore, the given question is asking for a place where a \"leg has the potential to be elevated with its body laid.\"\n7. The structure in which such an elevation could occur is a \"Hospital Bed,\" or a structure designed for such purpose.\n8. Other structures that are sometimes given but do not fit perfectly include:\n    - \"Grand Piano\"\n    - \"Flat Bed\"\n    - \"Elevated in the Air by an Object\"\n9. However, \"Hospital Beds\" are the most logical choice, being able to answer the \"elevated\" part and the choice, \"a person\" part of the question.\n10. We can use logic to answer the given question based on its given context.\n11. To reiterate:\n    1. The structure of a spinner wheel is not relevant to the question.\n    2. \"On a wheel\" doesn't make logical sense; hence, it can be ruled out as a possible answer\n    3. We can logically conclude with a rationale as to why options C, D and E do not make sense.\n    4. Thus, if you think about options A, B and C, none of them fit the given question, which is to place someone's leg with elevation.\n    5. Only \"Hospital Beds\", being a horizontal structure, can match the correct aspect of the question and give a reasonable answer.\n12", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}

Additionally, B: foot appears more likely than C: desert.\n4. Then among A: foot, B: foot and C: desert, 'desert' makes less sense.\n5.

The numbers outside the parentheses must be less than -71. E. The solution will be less than 12.\n\nRationales:1. Since the wording is 'The numbers within parentheses must be.... 'we can conclude that that one of the numbers inside the parentheses are required to be less than 18..\n\n7. If the inequality is satisfied by the solutions for 'x' or less than the numbers outside the parentheses it means that the inequality is not satisfied by the solutions for x or the numbers outside the parentheses need to be equal or less than the numbers inside the parenthesis.\n\n8.

{"text": "The teacher expected the students to prove that compassionate and thoughtful are both kind. They chose \"a. disingenuous\" because they saw it as 'fake in nature.' (This proves that they do not understand the concepts fully. A good example of this is when they believe that if the word is not being used to describe a person as an adjective than it is just a noun).\n\nThe teacher explained that kindness cannot be fake, meaning that someone cannot be \"fake\" in their kindness. The teacher had the students to show that compassion and thoughtfulness show that someone has a kind heart and that being compassionate is something human beings naturally gravitate to being. She explained to them that if we were to think of kindness as a noun, one might think of that kindness would be a human characteristic. However, if we use it as an adjective she has explained that it becomes something any and all can possess. She wants them to understand that although the use of an adjective or noun can slightly alter the meaning of the word, they will show their understanding through the use of other examples and context clues.\n\nTo show that our definition does not align with theirs, the teacher had them think about how they would describe their teacher as compassionate or thoughtful. Both \"A\" and \"B\" are incorrect since the answer for \"kind\" does not mean \"stupid\" or \"weird.\" \"C\" is incorrect for several reasons. \"D\" is wrong because compassionate could be in reference to animals. The students should understand through logic, \"E\" is incorrect when describing a noun because you cannot \"be\" human.\n\n### Response to Question 1\nThe teacher wanted the students to consider why it is important for someone to have compassion or to be thoughtful. The students could not answer because they did not understand that compassion is a human quality that we all have. They were under the belief that it would be someone who is compassionate or kind who is human. However, this is not the case because people are capable of many acts of brutality and cruelty but in humanity, we seek comfort, happiness, and understanding.\n### Solution\nTo be compassionate is to show emotion, care, or feeling for others.

The question about the p-value is correct if the student cannot calculate the p-value. The questions about using sample mean are true but only if the entire population cannot be used. The question about using a confidence interval when using only part of the statistics is correct, but it only happens when there are many samples instead of when one single sample is being counted. In addition, if you are using a confidence interval with only one sample, then you must also be using the entire population because there are no population-mean formulas for just one sample.

{"text": "1. First, I need to distinguish what 'heads' we are actually talking about in the question. The human brain is located inside the cranium where the skull connects itself to the rest of the bones in the neck and through. Since a single human head comes with one individual brain, which is located inside the single cranial cavity, and all humans share a single brain, the 'two'-heads the question is referring to are the individual human brains.\n1. It is therefore logical to assume that the 'all humans' that the question refers to are all the individual human brains combined. \n2. Since the question states that all humans have these 'heads' on the side of their body, it makes sense to consider all human brains on the side of each human body, which the person has on the left and the right side of their body. \n3. However, all humans have a 'left human' and a 'right human' which together the person describes the'side' of their bod.  Therefore, this makes human brains to refer to human minds only.

{"text": "Input:James kept a  Where might he keep? Choices:  a: shelf b: place of work c: desk d: office supply store e: school Rationales: \n1. Keeping anything on a shelf is not a logical place because James wouldn't have a shelf just for holding his clipboard.\n2. The place of work option is not likely because the clipboard is not a tool or item that James uses at work, rather, it is a place for keeping documents or notes.\n3. Option C: desk doesn't make sense because the desk is somewhere that James works or spends most of his time, not holds his clipboard.\n4. The office supply option is invalid because it would mean that he bought a clipboard at an office supply store.\n5. This doesn't make sense either since the clipboard is just a piece of paper or thin board with a clip.\n6. Therefore, James might keep the clipboard in A: School because he uses it everyday and it is somewhere that he spends a significant portion of his time.\n\nAnswer: A: school\n\nInput: The kitten wanted to get away from the mean dog.

He walked slowly and scampered away are not correct because the mouse can't trick the cat by running away or walking slowly.\n\n2. He stared at the puddle and waggled his tail are also incorrect because the mouse could not trick the cat by just staring or twitching.\n\n3. He stared is incorrect because the cat doesn't have eyes like humans.\n\n4. He waggit his tail is incorrect because most mice would just stand frozen or run away but no tail wagging.\n\n5.

Choices: \nA: inability B: bad grades C: low scores D: stress E: discipline\n\n### Response\nBeing too lenient with a child means that they will be allowed to do whatever they wish without limits, hence being 'too lenient'.\n\n\n### Reason\nBeing lenient with a child is not necessarily all bad though. Children are naturally playful and need to stretch their muscles to keep them happy. They also tend to get sick of monotony; too much structure and routine will wear them out and bore them. Therefore, being too lenient should not necessarily be a problem.\n\n### Beowulf:\nAnswer \nThe book is about a great hero, Beowulf who helps many people. Eventually, he gets slain by the monster Grendel, the son of a demon who lives under a lake. Beowulf succeeds in killing the monster but is fatally wounded in the process.

{"text": "Input:How much does each of the following items cost from an estate sale? The prices are:   - 2000 yen for a chair   - 4000 yenfor a dish   - 5000 yen to a shelf   - 3300 yen for an a/v stand\nRationales:1. To begin with, the student needs to determine the denomination of the yen, which should not be a problem since the students are supposedly educated enough to make sense of the question and its given prices.\n2. There are four different items with different prices in this question, so the student has to create a chart to make comparing the prices easier and more visual.\n3. To calculate how much each item costs, you first need to convert the price to yen. Then, you need to find out how many yen the 2000, the 4000, and the 5000yens' prices equal to and how that translates to dollars, which are the conversion rate and denomination for the questions currency.\n4. Once you know how many yen each price is, you can compare them to each other in order to see which one gives the lower or higher cost, from there you can multiply the number by -1 to know which item costs less (or more) than the others for a specific value.\n5. This method is then repeated for each of the items in the question. A chart can be made for this purpose to visualize and simplify the task.\n6. In this case, the items that cost more and less than the others are 4000 and 2000. These two items also cost more and less than 5000and 3300 respectively.\n7. So, in the end, we have four values: 1000, 1200, 1750 and 3300.\n            \n8. Finally, it could be mentioned that if the students were given two consecutive numbers like 5000\u20135010, then instead of the chart, they could also use the order of operations to carry out the math.\n \nAnswer:A: shelf  B: dish  C: chair  D: a/v stand\n \n### Instruction Answer the following", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

Answer: D) The number of pages required to finish a chapter. Answer: A) The number of chapters in a book.\n\n### Rationales\n1. Answer E) The number of page in a novel is the most correct choice.\n2. This is because the word bookworm implies that the person is reading a lot of books i.e. they read fiction novels, or books for pleasure.\n3. A bookworm wouldn't be reading the same book multiple times, therefore, the options B & C can be counted out.\n4.

The 3 sisters cannot live with the only owner and no one else.\nC: At the beginning of the tale, Cinderella ran away to a little bachelors cottege because she was mistreated by her sisters; but the bachelor cottage doesn't exist anymore because she now lives in the castle with the king and the prince. This option also does not make sense.\nD: This option does not make sense because in a barn, there is only one person to count as the sisters, not 3, so it's only 1.2 (1 person and two).\nE: In the forest, there is no specific residence/home for them either.\nF: The 3 sisters are no longer in the village; they have moved to the castle.

There is some confusion as to what they want from us, but we can assume that they want to convert cm to dm.\n2. The given value in cm, 1200, is too high because cm and dm are different units with different values.\n3. To solve this problem, we have to divide our given value by 100 before we can convert to dm.\n4.

{"text": "### Rationales:\n1. The last statement is about Bob's shoes. Running without shoes on a hot pavement means that Bob's feet hurt.\n2. We know that Bob lost his shoes.\n3. But Bob is not the only one who lost his shoes. \n4. So we know that they did not land at a place in which they were originally stored.\n5. The last statement is also about an unfamiliar place where Bob lost his shoes, and we know that he did not run to the corner store for his shoes.  So we can't eliminate \"corner store\" in the options C: attractive consistent, D: city block, or E: ground\n6. We do know that the corner store is where Bob lost his shoestrings. The sentence \"Bob lost his shoestrings\" shows that some part of his shoes (such as shoestraps or some other element) would be considered shoestrings. \n7. Therefore, it is not necessary for the choice to have \"shoes\" in the last word of the statement.  We are given a reason to eliminate choices D: city block and E: ground because in them, the last word is \"shoes\".\n8. Furthermore, if it was a coincidental statement about shoes instead of shoestrings, then we still would not be able to eliminate options A: a bed of sharp stones or B: town.

{"text": "What could a massive building be?\n1. Buildings are mass objects and if they are not constructed well, they will not feel massive and heavy.\n2. Hence, massive building can not be a substance.\n3. We know that for something to be an object, it needs to have mass.\n4. If a building is made properly, it is substantial. This word describes a large object or substances.\n5. Hence massless building cannot be an option.\n6. So if it is not constructed properly, it would not be of a massive size, making dwarf the only appropriate option.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question is what could a massive building be. I was not asked what is it.\n2. Substantial builds can be huge or not. For example a small house may feel huge. Huge does not equal substantial. The building must be made well and not collapsed or falling down.\n\n### Input\nThis question is about a task to make money through buying and selling products.

{"text": "The chemical reaction used as a heat source should definitely be one in which the reactants are combustible, and the result is a flame. Out of the choices mentioned we can eliminate options B: fire because fires do not produce the characteristic odor of roasting (burnt) hydrogen, or any hydrocarbon for that matter. This eliminates option B: fire.\n\n### We are also given the restriction that the reaction involves hydrocarbons and/or hydrogen. Of the choices available we see that it is not necessary for this reaction to involve hydrocarbons directly. There are many examples of burning hydrocarbons in air producing water, carbon dioxide and heat energy. However, the hydrocarbons present will contain lots of hydrogen bonded to other elements, hence this reaction takes place. However, option D: house is definitely not a product of this reaction because houses cannot be burned. Option B: fire is more likely to result in option A: coal or wood burning because wood and coal are both examples of hydrocarbons which can be burned in air. This also eliminates option C: lava. Option D: house can also be eliminated because it is a building and not a chemical reaction.\n\n### Option E: solar energy eliminates option A: coal or, because coal is a fossil fuel and cannot be generated by sunlight and solar energy eliminates option option C: lava for the same reason.\n\n\n### There is still only one remaining option, which is option A: coal or.\n\n### There are many other chemical reactions which fall under this category, however, our particular reaction must involve hydrocarbon, and most importantly hydrogen; otherwise it is not a burning reaction. Therefore our reaction must be a burning process which requires one reactant to be hydrocarbons (containing hydrogen) and the other to be combustible (air).\n\n### So the answer here is A: coal or wood.\n\n### The remaining options do not contain examples of chemical reactions which involve hydrogen. So we can say that the answer is A: coal or. \n\n### The teacher doesn\u2019t really want us to write the chemical formula for this reaction because that\u2019s not important here.

{"text": "[D] irritation.\n\n### Input (Demonstration): The solution given was B: being annoyed.\n\n### Detailed Rationale: 1. The first part of the problem describes the situation as such that the two men are standing in a queue (or in line) at the grocery story.\n2. We can deduce from this that they are standing in place (not moving) and the line of people is moving fast.\n3. The next few sentences mention a delay, which can mean it is taking longer for the people in line to reach the cashier's position.\n4. For a longer line, it can also mean that the line is out of order as in the people aren't in the right queue for they each have a purpose.\n5. The next few sentences also mention that the children in front are being loud, which doesn't mean anything really to the two men as they seem to be focusing on getting to the end of line and reaching the cashier.\n6. With all this information, the answer that the men are feeling irritated would be correct (or [A] frustration would be correct).\n7. The explanation given, however, had it as being annoyed.\n8.

{"text": "#### Explanation:\nThis question is similar to the first question, in that a logical question must be answered by using the rationales method. The question states that \"The big, spoiled child had his own playroom in the big house\"\n1) First, we need to know what the action the'spoiled child' expects from the environment around him is, in addition to the massive playroom.\n2) Secondly, we need to determine the size of the property, and we're given the clue that it's a 'house', narrowing our available choice to A: big house or B: nursery. \n3) If what the child expects is a 'big' playroom, B: nursery would not make sense, because the 'nursery' is usually just a small room next to where the parent sleeps, where the parent puts the child, so that it doesn't disturb them.\n4) The child expects a 'big' house, however, we cannot assume by 'big' that it's a large mansion because, in this case we already know that it's a spoiled, arrogant, and selfish child who would not appreciate such an environment.\n5) The question itself hints that it is not the 'big house' that the child desires but the 'playroom'.\n6) Finally, we only have two choices, but they're 'big' and 'house' is not in the sentence, so we should choose the right word as in the previous questions.\n7) The big house is not necessarily a house that's larger or bigger than usual, therefore, there are other things in the house in addition to the playroom, so the question should be rephrased to \"Which one of the rooms in the Spoiled child's play room was the biggest?\", and we're left with two choices, which the Spoiled child, however, probably would not want.\nTherefore, The answer is: C: Preschool\nAnswer: C: Preschools\n\n#### Further explanations:\n1. First, we don't know how large the child is and what the room is like as a comparison, so we can only rule out D: Building from the fact that it's bigger than the B: Nursery.\n2. Secondly, we can only rule out E: Retirement from the", "answer": "A: big house"}

But this comes at a later stage (step 4)\n\nHence, the answer that the students should be looking for is a combination of steps 1 and 3, which could be formulated to: write a letter to your senator. Answer: C: write a letter to the senator\n\nInput:Their job was to identify two problems of the town. Which ones did they think of?

{"text": "You may have seen people fall from a mountain and not die. That is simply a result of air resistance which causes the body to slow down and avoid impact. The body also spreads the force of impact throughout the body. So, in fact, most people survive an impact from a fall. While on the topic, I found this on the internet:\n\n\"Another force of inertial collision is impact friction, which is responsible for the stopping force that you feel when you hit something. In the case of human collisions, an estimate published in the New York Times places the stopping power of impact friction at 80 percent. That's right, you can stop an oncoming car by standing in its path.\n\nThe total stopping force of inertial collisions is known as the impact deceleration. In cases where humans come into contact with objects, however, impact deceleration is very small.

Choices: 1. A: father B: son C: father-in-law D: mother E: brother\nRationales:\n1. Because of the structure of the question - which is worded in the style of 'which' question - the gift described in the next sentence must be the one that was from whom, i.e. the one that was given from the mother's son.\n2. So, the object of the verb in the sentence immediately before the 'which' question must be A: father, which makes option B: son incorrect.\n3.

{"text": "**Choice** E. The cabin was not available, but what other alternatives were available? There are only 4 alternatives (villa, spacecraft, hall, and palace). Hall is the smallest of the four. Palaces are very large. None of these are suited for a family that's just returned home from a long journey and needs a place to stay that is both cheap and small. A hotel can be cheap, but if the family's traveling with kids, and even with a dog, then hotel room sizes will also be large. A villa or room in a palace are neither cheap nor suitable for a family. Given these constraints, an upgrade from a cabin to a hotel (which is the most expensive from the list) would be inappropriate.\n\n**Choice** B. The cabin was not large enough, so what alternatives do they have? None among the alternatives can be considered large enough, but there are only 5 alternatives (villa, space craft, hall, palace, and palace). Hall can be considered a'small' hall and thus not large enough. A hall and room in a hall are alternatives, but the second choice can hardly be considered big, unless it means the hall has four doors from which a room (also a hall) can be allocated. If that were the case, though, then those would be considered other small rooms, and not a large hall. A palace in addition to either of the other alternatives mentioned above will also not be considered large enough. If there were 6 or more alternatives, maybe one of them could be considered large enough to offer a reasonable upgrade, instead of from the options mentioned above, which are all small rooms or small-ish hall.\n\n**Choice A.** A villa is not a small cabin: it's smaller than a castle.\n\n**Choice B.** A spacecraft is not a small cabin (a small cabin is much smaller in size than a spacecraft).\n\n**Choice D.** A palace would not be suitable for a family due to the large size of the palace. Furthermore, a palace would be considered too expensive for the family.\n\n**Choice E.** A hotel would be too expensive, and perhaps a large enough size to accommodate a family, but still it might still not be adequate.\n\nHence, the answer would be the correct choice E: hotel. \n\n\n### Instructions: The teacher didn' t", "answer": "A: villa"}

They should write the step-by-step process that leads to the specific answer. It might be the same calculation or problem, but it shows that the student understands the process of solving problems.

The student could have calculated the following, $W=L \\times =$, but this is a similar method, but better for teaching the students.\n\n### Why You Need to Show:Students show they know the process. When they understand the process, they won't need you to give them the formula. They can calculate using what they know. For example, on a test, you don't always know the formula to find the area of a rectangle. However, you do know the process of how to solve for problem.\n\n### How Do I Get My Math Students to Show?First, you need to explain that you want them to describe the steps to reach an answer. Explain that showing the steps is more useful than just knowing the answer. Then, you can provide examples or give a small example to show how the problem is solved.

Choices:  F: Too heavy of a burden B: Too expensive C: Something you get extra for D: Too complicated E: Costs too much to attain to a degree Cite:\nSource:\nInput:\n\n### Response2:\nIn my opinion, the term 'price of success' signifies the sacrifices required in order to attain success. Often, it entails one having to give up many pleasures in order to get success in some field of work or life. A common case of such sacrifice can be the example of parents encouraging their children to prioritize studies rather than hanging around with friends after school hours. In this context, the parents might think of them providing proper and regular meals is a success for their children, in that their children are not starving. However, their children's desire to spend some time with friends is an equally valid reason for being happy for them, and also a sign of good social skills and a healthy life. Therefore, the parents should accept such decisions by the children, as the children have to strike a balance between their work and their social life, and have to take all the sacrifices as 'the price of success' of their future life.\nA: ''Too heavy of a burdon B: ''Too expensive C: ''Something you get extra for D''Costs too much to attaining to a great degree ''\n\n### Input2:\nCertainly, the term 'the price of success'can be interpreted in different ways. In my opinion, the sacrifices or compromises made by an individual or an organization to attain the desired ends are considered the price of success. These compromises can be related to the time, resources, and effort invested in the achievement of the desired goal. To give an example, many students have to compromise on leisurely activities and other social duties to focus on preparation for examinations. In that sense, the preparation or studying for the exams or tests can be regarded as a sacrifice by them, and therefore the price of success. It doesn'", "answer": "C: count"}

{"text": "### Instructions:\n\nIn order to find the answer for this question, lookout for the words; \"bac... as the card players sat... what were they playing\", all these have a connection to each other.\n\nTo continue, look at the words aquarium, background aquarium \"as the card players sat\" and it is clear that is a sea world (aquarium), and the card players are playing court room of games (sat emotionless) because they look in the aquarium, not the card room.\n\n### Rationale:\nIn order to solve this question, firstly we need to know what the action of the main verb \"swum\" is. It can only be; swim or swimming. The question then says that the actions happen \"as\", and since it isn't just, the action needs to be in the same order as its placement, thus it's swimming, swum. The next question we need to focus on is the phrase \"the card players sat emotionlessly\". In order for the players to be emotionless they must have been playing poker not a card shark. As the question said \"as the card players\" the action that has to be performed, or to happen is the playing of a game, which is \"court room\"; the only logical choice is \"court room\".\n\nThe next phrase is the last one. It means that the players are just sat on the court for a playing court game, in the shady corner that you can see them in, and in the distant background there is an aquarium that they are looking at. The last logical choice is \"sea world (aquarium)\"; the player are only focused on it and it is the background. It is a sea world (the aquarium), just as the question said in the background. The card players are focused on the sea world in the background, and so they are only playing court room. The sea is a background aquarium (the aquarium) the shark is in, so the card players are not playing poker. They are playing court room.", "answer": "D: poker game"}

{"text": "### Demonstraion:\n**Input:** What kind of place could have  thousands of statue?\n\n**Response:** This is a multiple choice question that requires the student to provide a response that picks the correct answer option based on the premise of the question.\n\n**Rationale:** 1. First, the student needs to check if the question is asking for the type of place that could have thousands of statues.\n2. Given the option A: church and E: large city, the question states that the subject of the statement \u201ccould have thousands of statues\u201d is a place rather than a person.\n3. This means that the only correct choice is place instead of person, as in the answers option A: church.\n4. Answer option B: theatre is a place but cannot have thousands of statues because the meaning of the word statue suggests that the subject is an item meant to be a person\u2019s likeness.\n5. Answer option C: large city is also not a possibility because there are cities that do not have thousands of statue.\n6. Answer options D, E, and F are all correct and are an extension of the question, but option D may require a more detailed explanation such as the location may contain many public areas dedicated to displaying different types of art or sculptures.\n7. Answer option B: large city may not be correct because although it is a place that can have thousands of statue, the possibility does not refer to the place holding thousands of statue.\n\n### Output:\nThe best answer is **A.**\n\n(The number of Statues) is placed in a Church and Central park\n\n### Commentary:\n\nAs a user of technology, I should write my code in a way that is easy to maintain and troubleshoot.

By everyone's loan amount and the interest was paid by the member of the group with the lowest income. 5. Each individual paying their loan in common funds by a collection from each member.\n\nRationales:1. The word principal and interest indicates that the loan and its payments are in monetary form, so the options where loan amount and interest were paid is out of scope.\n2. By each member pay the loan in common installments implies that each member had an equal contribution to the loan.\n3. By each member pay their loan amount could possibly mean that the interest on the loan was due in common funds by each.\n4. By the member with the lowest income paying the interest in common funds by the member with the lowest contributions could mean that the interest of each loan member was paid by one individual in the group with the least contribution to the loan.5. Each member paying their loan in equal installments is unreasonable since it means that the contribution of each member to the loan has an equal share of the loan amount.\n\n### Answer\nChoices: 4.

{"text": "If the teacher had to rate the answers, which answer could be rated the most correct? The answer that would receive the rating would be?\n**C: Forgiveness isn't a feeling or a emotion, it's an act - the act of forgiving.**\nToo many students equate forgiveness with an emotional state: 'they will FEEL better'. Forgiveness is not feelings: it's not a feeling. Forgiveness is not a passive emotion: you don't just sit there and 'wait' for it to come and hit you, that's not how forgiveness is meant to work. Forgiveness is in fact, an active decision to FORGIVE. It is your will. If we take the correct definition of what forgiveness is, and rephrase the question, it would read as:\n**If I have a forgiveing attitude toward someone, what attitude do they receive?** This is the attitude of forgiveness. If you have a forgiving attitude, the person forgiven will have received an attitude of forgiveness.\n\n### Additional hints:\n - The first step when solving a problem should be to identify, and define the problem.

There is almost always a problem to solve, but sometimes the problem is not clear at all to the student - or worse, the student assumes everything is known, and they can proceed and attempt to solve the problem. But what if the student has the wrong information? Or has some information but is missing some essential details? What would happen when the student starts to attempt to solve the given problem? They would become stuck - blindly walking around with the map in their hands. Or the student might make an assumption that the correct answer must lie so and so, when in fact, the teacher wasn't expecting that answer.\n - When solving problems, make it a habit to seek clarity and details from the teacher, if you don't know what to do next - or you are stuck and cannot proceed to the next step", "answer": "A: redemption"}

Because it's likely that monsters are not real, it is very probable that the possibility of being attacked by one would lead the average person to panic.\n2.

Furthermore, panic could also cause uncontrollable anger and lead to people seeking justice, which leads to A: getting people in trouble.\n\n#### Response 2-Mass Hysteria\nInput:Rumours of roving bands of killers could lead to what? \nRationales:\n\n1. People might believe that the rumors have some level of truth, which will lead to an increase in paranoia.\n2. This paranoia can have a wide range of emotions on the human psyche, which could lead to anger.\n3. This can also lead to an increase in mass confusion, similar to panic, and the spread of misinformation.\n4. Such conditions can also cause mass hysteria, where some people try to seek justice from the killers.\n5. Mass hysteria can also trigger a rush to join those going after the killers.\n6.

( 2 ) If a value cannot be obtained directly from the provided data set then it can exist in the list provided. Based on this, we can rule out options 2, 4 and 5. (3)Option 4 means there are only 2 values. So if option 1 is not present, the data set will contain 'chair' and 'table'. So option 1 can be the answer as it contains values that both are 'table' and 'chair'. (4) Option 3, if true, also means that the values are independent and are mutually exclusive.

Choices:  D: in the tree  E: inside the house\n\n### Response\nThe correct answers are A: feeding trough and B: in the barn.\n\n### Explain your thinking.\n\n##### For Instruction A.\n\nWe can tell that the farmer must feed the wolf. We can also see that some of the options involve things the farmer would provide food for. We can eliminate option A: feeding troug because no one would be feeding the wolf with a bowl. Option C: Cow feed is also easy to eliminate because it would not be for the wolf and it would be far too obvious for the questions. Option D: In the barn must be the answer. The farmer's barn is the most probable location that the farmer would feed something since they are a working place for farmers. The last option, E: By hand, can also be discarded since the wolf also cannot be given food by hand. The farmer would have to feed the wolf something that can be put in a bowl or dished out at a table which the Barn can fulfil.\n\n#####For Instruction B.\n\nAfter knowing that the girl must find a useful gift, we can then eliminate option E: Inside the house. Option D: In a tree is something in which the girl would not have to do much to find. Since the girl knows the items in the house, the house, being inside it, is an unnecessary option. The other two options can be left which can be narrowed down to having the girl to look for the item herself or for a gift that is useful. As for option C: Inside the tree, we can see that there are more useful gifts in a tree and so, the tree should be the correct answer.", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

In a shopping mall you'll find shops, but not a bar, so A is wrong.\n2. Schools aren't bars so it's not C.\n3. It would be rare to find a bar in a military base so E is wrong.\n4. The military forces people to serve if they didn't, they wouldn't join and would probably move to a residential area to avoid being forcefully required to go against their beliefs.\n5.

As New Hampshire is a state in the US, it would be an unlikely location, as the dog lives in another state.\n3. The coffin (option E: Denmark) is irrelevant.\n4. New England being an entire region in the US means that there are a variety of locations to be lost in, the most relevant locations (based on popularity) being Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts.

Employees working the night shift in the restaurant can be considered for the job only if they have a regular shift every 24 hours. This includes those working a night-only shift.\n2. Night shift may mean 12 AM to 8 AM, or it may mean Midnight to 8 AM. The first case should be considered only if the employees are considered as being regular or working nights as well as day shifts. \n3. Employees only have night shifts are considered regular employees here. This includes employees working only on Mondays in night shifts. It does not include employees in night shifts only on certain days.\n4. The shift is from 2 AM to 8 PM. Employees may leave the restaurant after their shifts are over. Therefore, they may never get another shift on the same day.\n5. Employees working only night shifts are considered permanent. Permanence means that employees may only be considered if their night shifts have also been regular.\n6. Employees who work in a shift that is from 5 PM to 11 PM may be part timers.\n7. A part timer working in a shift that is 5 PM to 8 AM is considered a night-only shift", "answer": "C: new hampshire"}

{"text": "Let us first understand the context of this question. Is the question talking about creating art? And what is art anyway? I would like to suggest that art is not something that people in the past were solely capable of creating. In the 21st century, we have created a definition of fine art and other forms of art. These include sculptures, painting, literature, theatre, dance, and many more. A person does not need to be a master of any one form of art to find joy in creating art. They simply need to relax. If they enjoy what they are doing, they can relax and enjoy themselves. It makes it stress free and easy for them to just let go. A person does not have to have a lot of money to appreciate art and create art. In fact, there are many famous artists who do not have the privilege of affording high quality art. Even though their art is not considered fine art, it still has an impact on people. And that alone is an art. Art brings joy into people\u2019s lives, helps people relax, brings pleasure, and even creates frustration.\n\n### Input What does someone need to do before they can be considered skilled at a sport? Choices:  a: start practicing b: practice often c: practice consistently d: practice carefully e: practice regularly f: practice persistently\nRationales 1. The question mentions that \u201cSkilled players\u201d do not necessarily win the game. 2. Players who are skilled at a particular sport have put in time practicing. 3. The word \u201cconsistently\u201d means that for a person to be considered skilled at it, they need to have put in time practising. 4. It is not essential to be a part of any league or championship to be considered \u201cskilled at\u201d a sport. As long as they have put in consistent practice time, they are considered skilled at the sport. 5. \u201cPersistently\u201d means to try to not give up. 6. \u201cPractice carefully\u201d means that you are not trying to rush through the game.\n7. In short, someone needs to practice consistently to be considered skilled if someones practices consistently, it is enough for them to be considered skilled.

The logic is the following:\n- The name of the child, their age and the name of the mom should be stored in seperate list, not in one list\n- Once we enter the age, we should display it by its correspondent name\n- The part where we print the last name then the last name of the mom is unnecessary because the only the last names of the children are given\n\n#### Corrections\n**Solution**\n- A list of the children with the age and the name of their mom is generated. The name of the children is taken from the user through input.\n- A list of all their mothers is generated.\n- The output begins with the mothers' name and ends with the age and name of a particular child (if it was only one child, only that name, age and last name would be generated).", "answer": "C: improved health"}

As long as it is below 2%, any economic indicator is only measurable.\n3. However, it can still be so negligible as to remain below the 2% targeted change of the indicator.\n4. It is because, even when inflation is a negligible factor for the economy, it's still important for the economy as an indicator and not as a source of any direct effect on the economy.\n5. Therefore, it would be logical in this case to classify the option E: _boring_ at the answer, which is neither a cause, nor effect of inflation.\n7. A: _economic instability_ is a possible direct source of inflation; however, it is not what the indicator reflects, not a cause of it.\n8. B: _not noticeable_ is an instance of the lack of economic instability; however, the indicator doesn't showcase the state of any individual indicator.\n9. C: _spend more_ is a possible source of inflation, but it is also not a cause of inflation. Instead, it is an indication in itself.\n10. D: _rising interest rates_ is a source of inflation; hence the indicator is the indicator of the cause in this case.\n11.

Choices:  E: london F: city G: subway H: city hall I: city\nRationales:\n1. The question states a very specific object; the telephone booths.\n2. If in contrast to the previous example with the word 'telephone booth' (which is a more general object), we want a comparison of more specific object, then we would need more specific details about which object is being compared to 'telephone booth(s)'.\n3. Therefore, this question is comparing train stations to 'telephone boooth(s)', thus, ruling out the answer C: city.\n4. The only remaining choices that include the use of 'train station(s)' are A: gas station, B: city, C: london, D: city hall, F: city, G: london and I: city.\n5. The answers that contain 'gas station' or 'gas stations' would have been incorrect, as they would be comparing gas stations and train stations.\n6. The answer B: city is a broader meaning of a city.\n7. The answer F: city is the English word for 'cidade', Portuguese which is pronounced as seetee.\n8.

There are different types of fevers, such as viral and bacterial, and it is important to determine which before administering treatment.

C: To make sure that people always remain alert. D: To mock a person's shortcomings and expose them. E: To mock the person who needs protection.\n\nRationales:\n1. If a defenseless person would like to flee, then we use the term \"flee\".\n2. The term \"sitting ducks\" can be used as a mock to some extent, but we also use these terms if a person is defenseless and needs protection.\n3. If a defensless person could always flee, they would only be referred to as a \"fleeing victim\".\n4. We use these terms, but they aren't the only option to describe the same situation.\n5. Finally, the term \"siting duck\" comes from the fact that ducks would sit still and are unable to flee.\nAnswer: B: Because a defensive person could always flee\n\n### Example:\nSituation: The teacher is making an observation about the students' response time, but he cannot be sure if the students are paying enough attention and not talking among themselves.\n\nQuestion: What can the teacher do to make sure all of the students pay focus attenton: Choices: A: Give a stern look to anyone who seems to be distracted.

The word 'dexterity' is defined as \"skill with the hands especially as applied to manual skill and usually involving the fingers, wrists and arm. It is commonly used to refer to manual or mechanical skill and agility.\" Therefore, it should be \"dexterous\" instead of \"dexterity\" as the word \"dexterity\" is an adjective.\n2. The sentence uses \"are\" instead of \"are not\" to convey the situation, so it would be \"if you are\" and not \"if you are not\".\n3. The word \"fiddle\", when used as a transitive verb, requires an object (i.e. fiddle with; fiddle about).\n4. The sentence makes use of the term \"fiddle through a music book\", which is an intransitive use of the word \"fiddle\".\n5.

Whereas if they are not farming, the use of toothpick is not relevant to the question.\n### Answers:\n> If it's farming animals, then the toothpick is used for their jaw pain for their animals by using the toothpick to relieve toothache like a normal human being would use. Whereas, if the toothpick is not used for animals, then the options other than A and E aren't possible.\n### Thus, the answer will be C to indicate the farmer is not using of the toothpick as food in animals.\nAnswer: C\n\n### Instructions\nInput: What is the first thing you should do when playing a video game?

{"text": "Answer: B: opera\n\n### Input A: Describe what you do during your time studying.\n\n### Response A:\n\nDedication, time, and effort are only some of the things I can use to describe what I do during my time studying.\n\nFirstly, dedication is a key component to study efficiency. For me, this has meant putting aside the time to study during busy times of the semester so that I won't get side tracked by other things. Dedicating the time necessary to a study session increases your productivity.\n\nSecondly, time is also a crucial component to being successful. I dedicate a set amount of time to study each day so that I can focus my efforts on certain topics and material. Sometimes I'll study for more than half an hour without stopping.\n\nLastly, effort is also imperitive to learning and remembering the information I've studied. To retain information I write down whatever I see on slides and write down important information in the margins on paper. I also listen to podcasts, because they engage me in a different way that helps me learn and retain information.\n\n### Input B: Explain what happened in the study to show that there was a significant connection between the two.\n\n### Part 2: Dedication and effort towards your study have been demonstrated in the data and information discussed in the study. \n\n### Response B: \n\nFirstly, the data and information discussed indicated that study time was found to influence students' exam scores. To show that there is a correlation between study time and exam scores you can use the data as evidence that study time was higher for students who had a higher grade percentage. The data indicates that there is a correlation because students who had higher grades (A + or B) had a higher study time than students who had lower grades (C -). \n\nSecondly, it was found that the study time had the strongest association with the students' grade percentage.\n\nLastly the association was determined to be positive because that the study time had a high value.\n\n### Other Comments:", "answer": "A: water cooler"}

{"text": "### Democratation:\nTreating this as a regular problem, without trying to understand it, let's begin our analysis. It reads: \"The master control for the **Tardis** is [where in the main room**?**]\". **Tardis**, in case you don't follow Dr. Who, is a \"time\" machine. That's the first indication that we're talking technology, although it could mean something else with the initial word capitalized. The last word is a verb, and it has to be related to the first word. We know already that the word on the left is related to time, so whatever that one means, it has to deal with the same aspect of it. Finally, both words must match each other, since they are a couple in this question.\n\nThe question states that the **Tardis'** master control is where in the main ***room**?*** This is where the question gives the context of where the master control is. The main word here is *room*. It can also be said that it's *where in (the main) room?*\n\nGiven a question where you don't know what is going on, one way to proceed is to look for hints and cues. In this case, the use of the verb-noun *master control for the Tardus?* could allude that the master control is not located inside the Tardus and is found in a place related to Tardus. In this sense, the *master control* could be **at** **(in**[**the main](https://stackoverflow.blog/images/2014/10/master_control.gif)room) the **Tardus**.\n\nTo understand a word, we need to analyze its possible etymology -- and if it is possible here, I'll try. The [Wikipedia article on The Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Lord), which is the term for the main character of the TV series, uses the word *lord*. While in Spanish and other Romance languages it has lost that connection with nobility or royalty, it still remains in English. We also find **the** as a prefix; it means *of the category* or *of the group*, as its Latin form, *de terra*, comes from *", "answer": "B: center"}
{"text": "1. First it's important to identify the subject of the sentence and what's happening within the sentence with the following sentences.\n2. The 'it' in line 1 is referring to the show but the last sentence of the story is about the gardener, so it's clear that the show was talking about the gardener, as well, and they both loved flowers, implying one of them is probably also a ranger.\n3. Next, the subject of the sentence is that there was a show about a ranger who loves flowers.  We should focus on rangers because the subject is a topic or person about which the speaker is talking.\n4. Then, we will ask \"what kind of show was it?\"\n5. Then, we ask, 'who's talking about the flowers?\"\n6. We know from the topic of the sentence and the actions in the show that there was 'talking,' so we know that there was another ranger talking about the flowers, so we know that the person talking has to be the 'other ranger'.\n7. The next thing to ask about in the story would be what the topic of the series were, 'flowers'. We know this because the ranger loved flowers and the show was about a ranger who also loved flowers.\n8. Then, the final thing to ask in the story is where the story takes place. The story took place in a countryside because that's where the topic of the show was: 'about a ranger who loved to flowers'.\n9.

In the sentence, there is a mention of a 'vintage, decorative', which means that it is something old, and is decorative/pretty.\n3. The choice of candle is eliminated because the only kind of light you can't see directly is a candle and would need some way of reflecting it. (If light were visible directly from your candle, the wording of \"light source in my possession\" gives no additional information.)\n3. Since the lamp would be used in the house to brighten up the room (unless candles are used in places like museums), it is the best fit.

{"text": "Choice: D: religion\n\n### Rationale:\nIt stands to reason that if the subject he enjoyed the most was social science, then his favorite subject would be religion since social science encompasses religion as a subject.\n\n### Next Problem:\n1. If the teacher's expectations from the students are not explicitly stated, how can we know?\n\n2. Why is Evaluating progress a typical thing teachers do?\n\n3. How can we tell that an action is relevant in this context?\n\n4. The teacher should expect the students to include examples. Why?\n\n5. What makes the option C: jail-cell an unlikely place for the cat to be kept indoor for an old lady?\n\n6. The student was good at traditional and excelled better in social science. This does not mean he was a perfect student in terms of traditional science alone; would you assume he was good at it too but his favorite was social science?\n\n1. If the student asked, \"What does 'expectation' entail?\", would his response be A: to explain the work of the last 3 days, B: to tell the next class meeting C: to add more examples and clarifications, D: to do more advanced topics, E: to explain the answer given previously.\n2. The choice A and B do not meet the requirements of the teacher, since'showing work and explaining' are not the requirements; the requirements are to 'include examples'. The remaining choices are all possible actions that a student could do to show 'examples'.\n3. When a student is given an instruction and expected to complete a certain task, an appropriate action would be to answer questions such as: what do I do when I run into a difficulty? What if I have an inquiry and I can't find an answer to it through my own research?\n4. The expectation of a teacher may sometimes be implicit and not clearly stated such as when they provide instructions to the students. In such a situation, the actions of the teacher, such as 'giving the answer and showing work' and 'completion and submission of the work' can be used to infer the expectations.\n5. Considering the requirements of the question to have the 'indoor only pet' to reside in 'C: jail cell', the expectation of the students would be to keep the pet in a different, less likely place", "answer": "B: history studies"}

If anything, the contestant's age would be the best choice to 'trick' their partner with, as they would usually try to guess it or have a certain idea about it based on experience.\n3. The choice C: shoe size is also incorrect; it is not something that the contestant would 'trick' their contestant about.\n4. If anything, it would be the contestant's religion that would be guessed about and would be the answer to option D: religion.\n5. However, it would be unlikely that a young partner is married, as the game is based on young couples who are newly married.\n6. There would probably be a misunderstanding over marital or non-marital status, and hence a young couple would not get married immediately after they've just married.\n7. Also, a contestant cannot trick other contestants, as the game requires that, given their respective answers and the number of correct guesses in which both contestants answered correctly, they are awarded cash.\nHence, the best answer to this multiple choice question is E: marital status.\n8.

{"text": "#### Explanation 1 :\nThe first sentence states the action - 'dancing for a long time'. \n\nThe second sentence uses the word 'leading' to imply the result of the first sentence. \n\nThis, however, contradicts the logic of the second sentence as a 'long time' already indicates a result and can't imply more of a result. \n\nWhat it means is that the first sentence is irrelevant. This means that the result of long term dancing is not'sore' which means the best answer is 'B: intercourse'.\n\nAs the second sentence does not use the word intercourse, we can use the word 'expression' as an addition which is a correct answer but would mean a different explanation.\n\n#### Explanation2 :\nThe response to the example is 'B: Intercourse'.\nThe sentence states dancing a long time will lead to becoming 'Sore'.\nIn this sentence, the first part, dancing, is a person's action. The end, to become sore, is in fact a result.\nTherefore, we can assume the author meant 'intercourse' instead of sore.\n\nThe second response is an answer to an explanation. It is answering the question why the author chose the word intercourse instead of sore. (it was indeed a typo mistake but the result was 'intercourse', not sore)\n\n#### Explanations 3 and 4 :\nThe responses to the above examples are the same and a response explanation is included in the answer.\n\nThe response for the first example is 'B: intersex'. As the second example is 'Explanations 3 and above', we can see that this is an explaination for the previous example.\nThe response to this explanation is 'A: Sore'.\nThe sentence states that doing something for a long time will 'lead' you to becoming a word.\nThis word could be sore or intersex.\nThe author chose sore and intersex are different words and therefore the sentence is incorrect.\n\nThe second sentence also does not use intersex so we can replace it with the word 'intercourse', but this is not logical. Instead of 'B: Sore' it should be 'B: intercourse', which it is.\n\nThe explanation for the previous example is 'B: Expresson'. The sentence states that doing something a long time", "answer": "D: become tired"}

The previous answer was C: put on an Ironed shirt.\n2. The 'pensioner' refers to a retired man or woman.\n3. This would mean that one of the requirements to a job interview will be a suit and therefore 'put on a suit' is a more rational option as A: put on makeup.\n\n### New input:\nA pensioner had a different number of things to do in preparation for the job interview in the morning. The teacher requested clarification of the question. Therefore, she asks for a different answer.\n\n### Rations\nA: put on make- up\nB: Brushing hair\nC: Put on an ironed shirts\nD: wash hair\nE: take up music \n\nB: brushing hair\n\nC: put on an iron shirt\n\nD; wash hair\n\nE: take up singing\n\nBecause the teacher asks for clarification of the answer the pensioner had to do, I believe the answer she is seeking is more along the lines with the option C: put on an irond shirt.

A 'fairground' is where fairs are held that involve rides and amusement park style attractions. \n   The food is taken for a'space shuttle', so there is no chance that fairgrounds could be used for a trip to space. \n   Since the question doesn't give any exact parameters, there is simply no logical way to relate freezing food with fairgrounds. \n2 A friend's house also isn't a logical or reasonable option because it is highly unlikely that a friend would have a space shuttle and be able to prepare the food for such a long trip. \n3. A'microwave' is a device designed to heat or cook food. \n   Therefore, the question must be about a large vehicle rather than something small found in people's homes.\n4. A microwave oven is usually used to heat or cook meals quickly. \n   The question gives us the hint that the meal is going to be used for space shuttles, so there is no point in having a device designed to cook or heat food.\n4. A space shuttle is likely too large for microwaves. \n5. Therefore,  the given answer choices must be limited to spaceships, which means space shuttles. \n6.

{"text": "In the following exercise, there's an important question to ask: does a person ever sell out?\nIn my opinion, a person cannot truly sell out since there's always some level of creative freedom or choice when the selling is done. In other words, any act of selling would be selling with a limited amount of freedom, which wouldn't constitute as complete selling out.\nNow that this was established, we need to determine which answer choice best fits in this context.\nIf we look at the answer choices, option A, the term'selling out' is most likely referring to someone who's betrayed their artistic vision in exchange for money or fame.\nThis option, however, is a bit too extreme because the implication is that the artist's vision was in line with his fandom, which may or may not truly be the case.\n\nNow, let's compare option B, the term 'peak of fandom', which seems somewhat plausible. In my opinion, this might be a good fit.\nThe phrase, 'peak of fadom' doesn't really describe a concept that involves selling out. Hence, it's possible the term, the action is a little misleading or that it's not clear at all.\n\nOption C: happy is a valid option but doesn't make sense since it says the artist knew his fandom was at a peak and did it anyways.\nThe artist could be happy in the sense that he earned money, but this could be a result of what this action entails or not.\n\nOption D: receiving is a valid choice but doesn't necessarily equate to betraying your artistic vision since you can choose to do your art freely, even if it's not popular.\n\nOption E: paying is also a possible answer. It's a correct answer if the artist is going to sell whatever it is he is selling. However, this option is ambiguous and can be argued.\n\nIf we take these answers into consideration, an answer that is plausible would be option B: happy. Even though some readers would argue that happy doesn't entail the term'selling,' it can indeed be argued, and it might have been possible in that case where selling is a bad word.\n\nAnswer: B: happy\n\n### Input : In which city can tour", "answer": "A: selling out"}

{"text": "The child is likely to laugh while walking to play.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n 1. The child is likely to laugh when going to play; a playful or carefree child probably won't sit unless there's a specific reason for sitting, and a child that's being entertained or happy would usually be in a different mood. (C)\n 2. Likely means 'probably,' which could indicate anything from the most likely to the least likely. \n 3. All the other choices have some form of 'doing' that is related to playing, unless the child is being entertained or feeling happy.\n 4. Walking doesn't necessarily mean walking slowly; 'walking' can mean walking anywhere. (E)\n 5.  'play' means 'play', so walking to play with friends could mean walking quickly, with energy. (A)\n 6.

{"text": "Write the response that fits the request.\n\nInput: A student who made a mistake on a test wanted to try again, but the teacher wouldn't let her correct her mistake? Choices: 1. A: change her grade 2. B: take a break 3. C: do nothing 4. D: change the work 5. E: give an extra assignment\n\nAnswer: A: change her grade\nRationales: In this scenario, the student is eager to prove herself after making an error on one of her tests. However, after informing the teacher about her mistake, the teacher immediately declines to allow her to correct her mistakes for her grade.\nThis action could only be explained by one of the student's parents. Since a parent is usually involved with their children's education, she may already know how the teacher grading is being done. And so she decided to not try again as to not lower her child's grade. This also supports how students who have committed to the task is not the same as those who did not.\n\nThis is also a scenario where the teacher, for whatever reason, might've had a bad day. Sometimes, if her bad day continues the next day, she's more likely to give the student even more mistakes. However, this scenario seems more likely to show how the teacher can have a bad day when grading for a long time.\n\nSo to summarize this scenario:\n\nStudent = Bad Day Teacher -> Teacher = Bad Day Student\n\n**Teacher = Bad Day Student \u2192 Student = Bad Day Teacher\n(If Teacher doesn't continue the cycle from the next day.)\n\nAnswer: B: take a break\nRationales: By taking a break from one of her student's problem, the teacher can also take a break from being harsh. This is a good scenario for the teacher to calm herself down. Sometimes teachers like teachers can't just decide to solve another problem if a student did one mistake already.\n\nAlso, since this is a scenario where she cannot do anything about it, and since it is clear that the student is eager to do, the best thing that the teacher can do is to let the student take a break. After all, there's only one mistake here, and if the teacher is taking a mental health break, then her grading of the test must be of top quality. If not, it", "answer": "A: ignore"}

Further, you notice that you require one technician to maintain information on all of the technicians. \n\nIn this project, you will create a Python program that will help automate the processes of returning a customer\u2019s defective computer, thereby streamlining, simplifying and improving these tasks.\n\n* The first step to this solution is to create a menu that will request the user input for each part of the customer return process.\n* The second part of the process will involve an if-else statement to determine which steps of the process the customer will go through. In this part, you will have to write Python statements that will check for the following criteria:\n    If the return is a PC with a cracked screen, the process is to assign the item to a Technician and charge the customer redemption price.\n    If the return item is a TV with any non-returnable defect, the process is to charge the customer redemtion price, and to ask if the item requires an exchange.\n    If the item is a TV that was not defected, the process is to return it to the customer.\n\nYour program must include a print screen at its end to show the user a summary of these results, with the final step being to determine if the computer should now be sold, recylced, or scrapped.", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

'Objects' in this context is a general word so we need to make it more specific like the objects in choice A: soft drink, and carpet.\n4. For objects that soft, choice A would have at least two items since objects soft can be two or more.\n5. Therefore, the two example of objects that are soft are C: Carpet and soft drink. \n6.

The girl was supposed to do more important tasks and the teacher asks another girl to go get the coffee for her instead.\n2. This proves that the first girl was in fact doing a lower-lever task compared to what she was supposed to be doing as a teacher\n3. Because she was unable to do as her title suggests, to be teaching, hence, she isn't doing her assigned job duties.\n4.

Choices: 156, 561, 772, 322, 873\n\n### Rationale\n1. The first part of the question asked what  the thing is that is being referred to as 'An example'.\n2. The options are: 156 stands for One hundred and fifty six, meaning its name is '156'\n3. 561 stands for Five hundred and sixty one, meaning its name is also '561'\n4. 772 stands for Seven hundred and seventy two, meaning its name is too also '772'\n5. 322 stands for Three hundred and twenty two, meaning its name too is 322\n6. 873 stands for Eight hundred and seventy three, meaning its name is similar to 322 and 772, hence it too is also called '873'\n7. Since 561,322, 772 all have their names called the same, the number 322 isn't considered as an example.\n8. The second part of the question is asking that of the remaining three, which is the one that has an example as its own name.\n9. 772 is chosen as it is the only one out of the three to have an example which also has the name '", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

An example could include hospitals, if you are bringing it there for medical purposes or business meetings in an office setting.\n\n### 3. What can be deduced from the image?\n1. There are two separate tires.\n2. The right tire seems to be newer and in a good condition with relatively less wear.\n3. The left tire looks older with more wear.\n4. There does not seem to be any air in the left tire.\n\n### What is missing from the image, and what does it imply about the bicycle?\n1. The missing image should be a view of the tire from the front.\n2. The tire seems to be flat from the angle provided by the image.\n3. This implies that the tire either needs to be inflated since it is flat or, more likely, was damaged.\n\n\n### How would you explain the difference in the bicycle? \n1. The different positions of the seat indicate that these pictures were taken with different angles.\n2. Moreover, the two bicycles were evidently photographed when both were at different angles, probably one in a forward motion and one in reverse, which would explain why the front wheel looks slightly to the right.\n3. These differences likely mean that these two bicycles are of the same model but slightly different in terms of the degree of wear and tear on them.\n4.

{"text": "A: Home for a visit (charme is a wrong meaning for charming )\n\nRationales:\n1. The question does not state that Charlie \"went away\" (outside).\n2. In the case of a \"home\" for a visit, it is obvious that the word \"home\" is used for his \"home team.\"\n3. While \"home team\" does not actually mean \"hometeam,\" it is more likely that the teacher wanted \"at home\" or \"home for a visit\" and the students chose \"at home\" and \"come back,\" respectively, to fill in the blank.\n\n\n3:\n### Input:During the battle of Gettysburg, the Union force was _____ the same size as the confederate force.

Gettysburg Battle was fought between Union Force and Confederate force.\n2. The Union force and Confederate force are both having the same size because it was mentioned that battle of Gettysburgh was between Union force and Confederate Force. Union force and Confederate forces cannot be more than the other.\n3. Same size and Between the same are two similar answers which mean same size.

{"text": "Small or huge\n\n### Instructions:\nFollow the instructions to write a response.\n\nInput:The Empire State Building is a famous building in New York City, where a lot of people want to visit, as it is very tall and beautiful. A lot of people find it interesting because it is also very big. It is one of the most famous landmarks to visit, and it is one of the tallest ones in the world, so the whole building is just huge. Its location is also very interesting, as it is located in the city, where most of the other landmarks are too.\n\n### Response Instructor:Describe the Empire State Building by choosing two of the options (big, tall, huge, underground) and provide evidence to support your choice(s).\n\n### Response Writting:\n* The Empire State Building is a great landmark to visit because it is tall. \"The tallest building in the world.\"\n* It is very wide and long and has a very interesting shape, because it looks like it has a square in the middle of the building \"The square has an area of 45 m\u00b2.\".\n\n### Rationale for the answer:\nThe Empire State Building is tall because in the beginning, everyone found it to be very beautiful and very tall. \u201cThe tallest building in New York\u201d.  Everyone was surprised by the height of the building, and this why it stands out among the rest of New York's buildings.\n\n### Direction:Review your previous steps to determine if you followed the correct steps.\n\nRationales:\n1. The direction at the start of the question states that the goal is to describe, so the instructor may have thought all of the following descriptions were unnecessary in this case: the Empire State Building is a high and big building/ tower in New York, it is tall and has a beautiful shape.\n2. The choice of words is important, so, using the word 'the' before describing the tall shape of the building would not make sense when using it to describe the building as huge or even big or even tall.\n3. The use of the word 'tall' in the initial description is used to describe the building's height, and it is not describing the building's appearance or shape (that of being tall, in the sense of having a high shape)\n4.

{"text": "- D: _face south_\n\n### Instructions:\nThe teacher gave an instruction and a demonstration. Write a response that properly completes the instruction.\n\n### Input, Demonstration:  \nIn this problem, a set-up is given where in a teacher gives instructions to a set of students, followed by a demonstration for said instructions. \n* The teacher provided the students with 7 or more candy bars.  The only thing the teacher tells the students is that they should start dividing the litterally 15 candy bars into as many equal parts as possible.  The objective of the activity is to get as much as possible into as few parts as possible.  That is, equal parts are desirable, but it is not required.\n* The teacher first starts with only a single candy bar.  It is easy to divide the candy bar into 4 equal parts.  The teacher then divides more and more candy bars into 4 equal parts until they reach and exceed 7 candy bars in 4 equal parts.\n* The teacher finishes with eight candy bars.\n### Rationale: The student has no real idea how to divide the candy bars into the most number of equal parts.  A teacher could then explain to the student about using long division to determine the total number of equal parts you need.  The teacher could then have the student divide 7 in four equal parts by explaining it this equation: `7/4=1.75` and saying that four is not that close to 1.75, so go ahead and round up to 5 parts.  The teacher could give a hint by saying that the student could start with the number 5.  The teacher could also give a general hint to using math to work out a problem and then leave it to the students to figure out the exact math.  The teacher could finish with the eight candy bars in 8 equal parts, using this equation: `8/4 = 2`.  The teacher could give the student another hint by saying that the students should have a number ending with an even number.  The teacher could have the students do a few 5 and 6 candy bar division sets.  The teacher could say that is a good first step since 32 and 35 are both close to 32/4 = 8, which is pretty close", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

An expert is someone who has studied, researched, or trained in a specific field or knowledge,\n 2. and in some instances, people also refer to an expert as someone who claims to know a lot about a specific field but may not have actually done any research of their own. In this case, you can refer to an expert as a person who is considered knowledgeable and has done sufficient research to speak about the topic with authority or credibility.\n 3. In this assignment, the students are supposed to listen to an expert speak.\n 4. Based on the definition of an expert given above, it is quite likely that they are hoping to learn something.\n 5.

Giving all boys time to stand can ensure that each student is standing when the teacher is ready to begin class. \n\n* The boys will only stand if they are given a time to do so. Without specifying a period of time, there will be no motivation for the boys to move to the position their teacher is expecting/desiring them to be in. The best answer for this question, given the details provided, is \"give all boys a time to stand.\"\n* Note that \"give all the __ boys time to stand.\" does not work here either. \"The boys\" does not refer to a particular group in the room, rather it refers to all of the boys in the room.", "answer": "B: try to learn"}

It is true that the library has tables, but the context is completely different because there are no meals or food in this context.

One of the choices is C: Money can be a coin. This statement is not a true statement because money does not only exist as a coin. Money has a number of other forms that could be considered real money and true money. These forms can include bank account money, bills, coins, among others. These forms of money can be valid, and they can be true money. According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, \"Most of the money we use to make purchases is actually paper money.

{"text": "Sarah took the poison. She didn't find it in a place she normally wouldn't put it. However, she found it in the cabinet in which she might keep junk food or drinkable supplies from the kitchen (water, drinks, etc.).\n\n### Rationale:  The question mentions a poison mistake and says Sarah found it in the cabinet. The poison must have been a substance that Sarah thought was either a) drinkable or b) junk food. \n\nThe question then asks about the poison and says it was \"what.\" The answer 'drinkable' does not make sense because the poison was a mistake. It could not have been drinkable because otherwise it would probably not have been a mistake.  As a result, the poison was either 'junk food' or'medicine\". \n\nThe remaining choice, 'antidote,' does not make sense because antidote comes from the medicine. Thus, antidote doesn't work here. \n\nThe remaining three choices are: \n\n* 'junk food' - 'junk food' is what we consider food but not nutrient. It contains ingredients such as sugar, salt, oil, preservatives, and food coloring such as red 40; these are harmful ingredients. They are harmful to the health of one's body; so, Sarah should not have put down poison that is considered junk food, but rather \"antidote\" (medicine).\n*'medicine' - medicine comes from the medicine cabinet. Medicine comes from the pharmacy,  which contains drugs and antibiotics. Poison is the exact opposite of antidote and the medicine cabinet. One should not put down poison in the medicine cabinet because it is toxic. Toxic items are used for medical use with proper procedure so they can't be classified as an antidote. In addition, Sarah thought that poison would not be antidote but she also thought that the antidote came from the kitchen and the poison came from medicine. Poison is harmful and it was placed in the wrong cabinet but antidote only contains necessary ingredients that help your immune system fight off health issues, so it was not the wrong cabinet.\n* 'nutrient' - there is no such option because poison does not have nutrients; therefore,", "answer": "C: medicine"}

James is looking for lunch and using a cannon, so it must not be for lunch.\n\n### Response Cont.:\n\n### Demogrant:\nWe could speculate that the thing that James is trying to shoot represents food and thus the cannon could be for lunch.  A: body armors is not something you would need when lunch is the goal B: ungula is not a target for something while seeking lunch, you could be aiming to kill him E: an animal is not the goal C: no clue what a bomber could be D: kill people might be true if they were killing a person and a bomb was tied to them E: I think the question would have been worded differently for animal, but, if you accept it as a target, then kill a person and a bomb is tied to them\n\n### Demoratic:\nI would think the question was asking for something you would be \"Aiming at\". You would not have to shoot a person in the head from a close range with a Cannon to kill them, instead you would be using a Cannon to shoot something that was at a further distance. The term used was Seeking Lunch, which means James is searching/looking for something, not necessarily looking for food. So you would be looking for prey, rather than a target to kill the prey. So \"Kill people\" cannot be the correct answer, because people is not one of the answer choices given, and you cannot shoot body armor with a Cannon. \n\n### Demosthenes:\nI feel like James being asked to shoot body armor with bullets from a cannon would not make sense logically, seeing as how body armor is a form of protection against harm.

{"text": "A: in the office\n\nInput:Which answer is correct? Choices: A: A=H B: M=O C: O=G D: D=F E: H=E\nRationales: The question here involves a logic problem and involves letter assignments.\n1. If A=H, O=G, and B=M, then is the answer to the problem G or not?\n2. M is a letter in the alphabet and should be represented by a symbol.\n3. Thus, if we assume O represents G, the correct answer should be M, since G is assigned to O.\n4. A,E,G, and H all have different values in the alphabet, so they cannot be equivalent to one another.\n5. There are multiple problems that require H=E. An example is shown below:\n\n**Input:** The boy asked the girl: What time is it, and she replied, The sun has reached its noon. The boy responded asking the girl: What time did you reach your noon? This implies that The sun has reached its midday. What time was its noon? The girl replied: It hasn't reached its noon yet. What time is it, now? The boy responded: Its noon. When does it arrive at its noon? What time do you reach your noon tomorrow? What time does _the sun reach its noon?, today?* The girl replied, Today. When tomorrow? What time are you, reaching your noon?* The boy responded: In three weeks. What time is six now?**\n\n**Rationales:** In the question above, the words \"sun\" and \"noon\", should have the same meaning. However, from the context, \"noon\" appears to mean the middle of the afternoon, whereas \"sun\" appears to mean the sun at its peak. According to the girl's answer, the sun's noon is different than the middle of the afternoon (\"The sun hasn't reached its midday\"). The boy could assume that since \"sun\" and \"the sun's noon\" have different meanings from \"noon\" and \"the middle of the afternoon\", respectively. For this reason, the boy asked: \"What time did you reach your midday?\" which would imply the girl's answer to be \"It hasn't", "answer": "B: office"}

This means we can have the date 1896 and since there are 100 years between our date and 1600 this means that we'll get 1896 - 1600 = 296, which would mean that 2096 - 296 = the year 2096.\n\n### Other\nAnswer: D: 2096", "answer": "D: city centre"}

The easiest way would be by putting the account book where you are mostly likely to find it. This is why the account book would almost definitely be kept on my desk as this is where it is most likely to be found.\n\n### Justification.\n\n* This is the best of the provided options because it indicates that the account book is to be found on your home desk. This is where you are more likely to have it, and it is also what it is most likely to remain. This is also probably something you don't carry around with you so you wouldn't keep it somewhere where you leave it unattended.\n\n### Expected result.\n\n* The requester will then know that the account book is probably not found somewhere else and are most likely not expecting the book not to be around.", "answer": "C: desk drawer"}

{"text": "You _________ the papers together.\nRationales:\n\n* The action would be in the form of holding the loose papers together to ensure they are not dislodged and all the paper is not thrown around.\n* One option B-bound is not applicable because papers are not bound, they are loose.\n* The option A: tighten is still not applicable. Tightening would imply the action of pulling the papers together or otherwise making a bunch.\n* Another option C: bound would also be a redundant use of two different words to describe the same action since bound refers to making bound, not keeping them together.\n* Option D: faithfully would, again, use two redundant words to describe the action, since faith would mean to hold something steadily together and fully is redundant.\n* Option E: compact refers to keeping something neat or tidy.\n* Thus, the answer to the question is C: bound.\n\nAnswer: C: bound\n\n### Input\nHow much is 3 to the 8 power plus 4? Choices:\n* A: 921\n* B: 920\n* C: 2349\n* D: 6188\n\n### Response\n\nRationales: The question is asking how much is 3 to 8 power plus 2. The choice is the power of 3 and not the power of 8 because the exponent can be applied to any number.\n\nChoices:\n\n* A: When the exponent is negative, it is negative one. Thus 8 to the negative 3 power is 1/8^8 = 1/512.\n* B: Since the exponent is positive, the power is positive one. Thus, 3 to the 4 power or any power is 3^4. The answer for the question is C.\n\nNotes:\n\n* 2 to the 4 power is 16.\n* 8^0 is 1.\n\nAnswer: The answer to the question is 3^4\n\n### Input.

C: The division of two numbers is accomplished by using digits.\nRationales: It is important to state that the answer must be comprised of the two parts (instruction A), so we start out the answer with the instruction A.\nInstruction A:  It is common knowledge that, to solve long division, we must first get familiar with using digits, or numbers, and how they relate to one another.\nInstruction B:  To complete a division problem between two numbers, we must first use digits.\nBoth instructions describe how to do a specific task - in this context, long division, and both instructions use 'instructions'.

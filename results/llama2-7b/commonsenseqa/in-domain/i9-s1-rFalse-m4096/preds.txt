Choices: A: to get through a boring speech. B: to try to figure out what’s said. C: to ignore what is said and talk to someone else. D: because it’s what they’re told to do.<n><n>Answer: A<n><n>``` <n><n>This is a very basic "answer is A" type question. It can be rewritten to "When someone speaks, a person can choose to listen closely what?" and then the student can select the option "what is said." If the student is looking to get out of doing homework, they can simply change the wording a little bit to fit their own context. I do encourage the student to understand how to actually answer the question instead of to try and use this tactic to avoid doing so though. It is recommended to just simply answer the questions.<n><n>---<n># [Python Basics](https://www.freecodecamp.org/python)!<n>## [Basic Calculator](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/intro-to-python/lessons/introductory-exercises/practice)<n><n>### Exercise:<n>Write some python code to display a plus, minus, division and multiplication button on the screen as objects (for instance by using "pygame module") and make the user click the button and have the program calculate the right answer and show that on screen.

A well-chosen metaphor does what? Support your answer with examples from Shakespeare (and other texts, if you'd like).<n><n>Metaphors are figurative language that provides a comparison between two things, unlike similes, which provide a comparison between two things using words such as like or as.<n>The way metaphors work, is the comparison is never explicit. Instead, the reader is led down a path of understanding through the text of the metaphor.<n>For example, in Hamlet's speech from Act 1, scene 5, he claims, "For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings / That then I scorn to change my state with kings." By using the metaphor of a rich king as being nothing like the sweet love he once knew, foreshadows his eventual descent into madness.<n>

But I realised that there are more ways.<n><n>What I tried<n><n>I tried a brute force approach<n>I tried to keep track of what is the current state of nodes by passing a flag variable "isInUse" and "isVisited".<n><n>I tried to use maps such as `HashMap`. I realised that this is a very effective data structure  but it's used in a very inefficient way.<n><n>I tried to build a linked list with an added flag and found it was very inefficient as there are lots of wastage of nodes and memory space. <n><n>A linked list also works but instead of using a node that contains <n><n>`if isInUse{use} else {isInUse=false};`<n><n>We use a node that will contain just the number of items that are already used. and just increment and decrementing the number of used nodes. This is like using a counter. <n><n>We then traverse through each node of the linked list and add the nodes that has an unused variable to the stack as we encounter the unused nodes.<n>In this way it's more efficient than to use a stack for two things, but its complexity will always be greater than the number of nodes. This is called O(n) instead of O(1) like a stack. However this is an exceptionally efficient O(n).<n><n>### How I built

Choices:  W: use the bathroom __: __ B: use the bathroom F: eat __:__ __:__ __:_:__<n>Output: D : F<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>I started with the idea, "What is not ____ " and made sentences.  After writing a sentence that was not something, I would use a single word that I've never seen used in a sentence before.  Once I felt I had exhausted all the options, I used another single word to generate an answer.  For example, with "The house is close to no other houses" I had options like "lone" or "loner house", "near houses with more people", "on it's own, separated" and "needs other houses".  By adding in "houses with no other houses close", all these solutions ended up not being what I was looking for.

They like to be where? Choices: A: with a girlfriend B: at a restaurant C: in a relationship D: in bed E: in the city<n>Output: A: with a dog<n><n>Input: When John and Mary are on a date they are where? Choices:   A: in a movie theater B: at a coffee shop C: on a couch D: in a bar E: on a bench<n>Output: A: in a movie<n><n>The correct output is <n><n>$p = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, -1] $<n><n>The first four outcomes were incorrect. For the second outcome, 'own home' and 'bathroom' were interchangeable. In addition, there is a second option that can be answered with 'hanging up'. However, I guessed on this question since I had no way of knowing where I would be when asking for an answer to 'inquiry number [123]'.<n><n>In the final outcome, the 'doorknob' option was interchangeable with the 'dooorway' option. The option 'bed' was not included since a dog and a human are not the same. Finally, for the sixth question, the answer was 'yes.' I do not believe that bats wash themselves. I have seen bats, and they will rarely touch a pool of water in a lake or pond unless they are desperate from thirst. There is no reason for a bat to seek out where to wash itself, but when washing, bats avoid water and bathe themselves somewhere else.<n><n>My final answer is [1, -1, 1] since the questions were answered similarly to [0, 1, -2].

They may see many cars that are behind them, so they will probably not move to be closer to the edge of the road. However, a truck driver is looking at the front of a truck, and to compensate for the truck's mass and balance, they tend to drive further from the edge of the road when travelling behind someone. They will probably have their mirrors angled away from the side of the truck, to look further down the road, or to look at the vehicle to their side.<n><n>### Input:<n>"What would the truck driver see?"<n><n>### Output:<n>"The man was looking behind him, and saw another man riding a bicycle.

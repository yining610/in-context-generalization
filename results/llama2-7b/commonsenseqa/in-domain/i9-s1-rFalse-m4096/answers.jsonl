A well-chosen metaphor does what? Support your answer with examples from Shakespeare (and other texts, if you'd like).\n\nMetaphors are figurative language that provides a comparison between two things, unlike similes, which provide a comparison between two things using words such as like or as.\nThe way metaphors work, is the comparison is never explicit. Instead, the reader is led down a path of understanding through the text of the metaphor.\nFor example, in Hamlet's speech from Act 1, scene 5, he claims, \"For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings / That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\" By using the metaphor of a rich king as being nothing like the sweet love he once knew, foreshadows his eventual descent into madness.", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

But I realised that there are more ways.\n\nWhat I tried\n\nI tried a brute force approach\nI tried to keep track of what is the current state of nodes by passing a flag variable \"isInUse\" and \"isVisited\".\n\nI tried to use maps such as `HashMap`. I realised that this is a very effective data structure  but it's used in a very inefficient way.\n\nI tried to build a linked list with an added flag and found it was very inefficient as there are lots of wastage of nodes and memory space. \n\nA linked list also works but instead of using a node that contains \n\n`if isInUse{use} else {isInUse=false};`\n\nWe use a node that will contain just the number of items that are already used. and just increment and decrementing the number of used nodes. This is like using a counter. \n\nWe then traverse through each node of the linked list and add the nodes that has an unused variable to the stack as we encounter the unused nodes.\nIn this way it's more efficient than to use a stack for two things, but its complexity will always be greater than the number of nodes. This is called O(n) instead of O(1) like a stack. However this is an exceptionally efficient O(n).\n\n### How I built", "answer": "A: mouth"}

You can split the problem into 3:\n\n\\begin{code}\n1) What could be the object that would not be of any use?\n2) Why do it when one is about to work?\n3) Where to look for the pens?\n\\end{code}.\n\nAfter that you would solve the 3 parts separately and then for the probability go over all of the answers and get the one that is wrong", "answer": "C: computer science"}

Describe the process you took to understand how many of these branches that there were in the program in general and for each of these branches, describe the process you took to get to the final answer as that input is entered. \n\n**Answer 1:** This is the simplest thing to do. You put every case in their own switch statement and print a comment like `this choice selects this choice`. It was simple for me because each line of the code has it's own comments and that can be easy to trace back to each choice when you are writing the instructions. \n\n2.

What could the first two or more options to the final question look like here and how would you use the program differently to account for each?\n\n**Answer 2:** I could try all of these three choices to look for how many branches there are in total in the program. For every choice that I made, I could go back to the program's instruction and determine where the new branch would be created. When I go through the choices, I would print the comment and determine if it is to be the first, second, or third branch, if it", "answer": "A: georgia"}

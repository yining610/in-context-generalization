Explain the logic behind your argument.<n><n>### Justification:<n>The person(victim) has two options, respond to the harmful behaviour as it is directed at them or respond as an attempt to resolve the conflict, the first thing a person will do is to think about their options for responding and they will ask themselves "what do I want to happen next?" and the question of what do you want them to do it that next step will then define your response, if you choose "I want to stop what ever is happening", its best to respond to it as it is directed at you, but if you choose "I would like to understand the other person's intentions and maybe respond as an attempt to solve the conflict" then you should give the person a fair chance to explain him/herself before you decide to respond as if you were the victim, what if its not about the person but the persons perception of you, maybe you were just in a different part of town and you were carrying the same bag he /she assumed you had what he was looking for, you don't look like the stereotype of a drug dealer but you are carrying something you were just at a different location in town and the person assumes that is your location because drugs are predominantly sold in specific locations in town so the person tries to engage them self to communicate their intentions with you and you assume this to be a robbery so you decide to run and tell the police, you could have responded to it but you choose to respond as if you had assumed that is what the person wanted it to be.<n><n>### Commentary:<n>This is an application of the 8D's from the book of Romans<n>    8:28<n>    "For we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."<n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol? Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Answer: E: gas station<n><n>Input: Where might a television used at night be? Choices:  A: cabinet B: house C: apartment D: bedroom E: woods<n>Answer: D: bedroom<n><n>### Input:Where in a town would you put your shed? Choices:  A: next to the house B: keeping things in C: backyard D: farm yard E: ranch<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I hope I have understood you correctly, as I have been instructed to answer your questions in which you wanted, I believe after reading all the questions I will find my correct answers to your questions.<n><n>### I think, after seeing your questions and doing some little research, I have found some answers. I believe that the first question is the right answer. I believe that the answers to the first question that you asked to me is the type machine that was very intricate. I believe that the answer to this question is "A: apparatus." This is because an apparatus is a machine, that it is a complex machine. I believe that is why this would be the right answer.<n><n>### The second question is: "Where do you get petrol?" I have found out that "petrol" is not a word or anything that people use, and it is not the same as fuel, either. I found out that petrol is British English. But then again in British English; it is a slang way of saying gasoline, and fuel is another term that people call "Gasoline." And in American English, the way people say it is "Gasoline," and in British English, it is just called petrol, also when people need fuel, they will say gas; they will not say petrol and this is confusing. I hope this means it is a correct answer because I do not know what this question means, and I do not know what the questions mean.<n><n>However, after doing this task and searching for the right answer, I have learnt that there could be many different types of terms that people can use for fuel that could mean gasoline, or petrol. And if that was not confusing enough, after looking up some more words and searching for an answer, I found out that Gasoline is a brand name that was created in the United States in 1865, and in England, they call it petrol.<n><n>If you take a look at the picture, I have decided to put pictures of gasoline and petrol because they are both terms that people use for fuel, but they all call it gasoline. In Britain, they call it petroleum, and in America, they call it gasoline. And there are many different slang sayings for both terms. I have also put a picture of fuel tank, and car to show you an example of different ways to call petrol or fuels.

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol?

Choices:  A: cabinet B: house C: apartment D: bedroom E: woods<n>Answer: D: bedroom<n><n>### Input:He had an index card he had to return, so where did he put it after finding the book he needed? Choices:  A: inside the book B: oral report C: library D: fileing cabnet E: card catalogue<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>* ANSWER: B: inside the book*<n>* WHY: A: The correct answer would have been “inside the book” because it matches with the question, that was what the man was asked. For instance, if the question were, “Where do you get cheese?,” one would respond, “In a grocery store.” ANSWER: The word “inside” is important because it follows the verb “return” in the question, which fits with “inside a book” in the answer. (“He had an index card (verb) he had to return, [so he put it] inside the book.” [answer]) The word “so” begins the question, which is not part of the answer, and “book” makes more sense and is more inclusive than “the book”—that is why E and C would be incorrect. ANSWER: “Return” is the verb in the question, and is the past participle form of the verb “return,” and the participle form can be used as an adverb, in which case it can describe the process and location. In this instance, since the man was returning the card, he “put the card inside the book.” The “book” would have been where the card was returned. ANSWER/INFORMATION: This question contains a run-on sentence because the question contains a conjunction (“so”) and “where.”<n>* ANSWERS: A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not match the question in any way.<n>* ANSWED: C: library is not correct because it does not match the question. In addition, a library card cannot be “returned,” and so could not be put inside the book.<n><n>### Inputs:How many years was he in the army? Choices: 1) 17 A: the correct answer 2) 18. B: the incorrect answer 3) 25 C: the incorrect answer 4) 26 D: the correct answer E: the incorrect answer<n><n>### Response<n><n>* ANSSWER: B: “18 years” is incorrect because the army only goes up to 17 years. The correct answer would therefore be “17 years.” You also need to note what the question asked and what the person answered! ANSWER: *How many years had

Choices:  A: shelf B: cellar C: refrigerator D: cupboard E: grocery store<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Dear Mr/Ms Manager<n><n>Thank you for the opportunity to explain how to improve the food drive. The task of collecting food requires the employee to have a variety of appliances, including a fridge and a car to deliver the food.<n><n>There are different ways in which they can make an improvement. Firstly they may consider picking more containers for food. Secondly they could consider picking containers from stores that would be more likely to have a customer willing to donate food - such as grocery stores that serve richer areas.<n><n>Finally the employee could consider picking more often. After a week a delivery of groceries would be better received than a single delivery of groceries over a month.<n><n>I believe that picking more than one item from a store would be beneficial. This means that the employee would be able to access more clients and would be expected to donate to the cause.<n><n>Yours faithfully,<n><n>### Response2:<n><n>### The task manager is expecting to improve the food drive for the food bank. The employee is required to make adjustments to the food drive process to increase the total amount of donations. The employee will need to improve their process. The answer that would be correct is picking more often.<n><n>### The employee needs to improve their process because there are several areas where improvements can be made.<n><n>First they could consider picking more containers. This would require having a variety of appliences with them. This would mean they would have a cool box in their fridge on a hot day and they would also have a food container to take to the bank on the same day.<n><n>Secondly the employee should pick containers from stores that would have more people willing to donate food. It is possible that they will have a better chance of success by picking from a store that is located along a bus corridor than a store that is not located along a bus corrdior.<n><n>Finally they could pick more often. This means that they would make shorter trips and would be more willing to go back to a particular store for more donations. In addition the food would be fresher when it was picked on a day after it had been made.<n><n>I believe they would be better off choosing to pick more from local stores that have people who would be more willing to contribute food.<n><n>### Response 3

Even though bubblegum is sometimes composed of latex, chewing gum (like any other piece of candy) is safe to ingest. The only times you might have a problem with chewing gum is if you already have an intestinal blockage or if you have intestinal conditions that make you very susceptible to blockages. Even though there have been some reported cases of blockages, eating gum is not known to be a contributing factor.<n><n>### Reason2: Because it has a very low risk of causing choking or airway obstruction, even though it might feel uncomfortable for a few hours.<n><n>Swallowing gum seems to be extremely safe. It could get stuck on the inside of your cheek, which isn't unpleasant and might even feel relaxing. The only problem chewing gum might cause is if it gets stuck in the throat, causing choking. Although it doesn't appear to have happened often enough to be an accepted hazard, it's still possible for a piece of gum to get stuck in the back of your throat (especially if you're having a hard time swallowing). Luckily, this usually takes a few hours to

John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n><n>### Response:		D<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>This instruction describes the concept of _input_ and _output_, which will be explored in more depth later in the tutorial. <n><n>It describes an incomplete task: where do I get petrol, which John wants to answer after knowing the answer. <n><n>When describing a task in multiple choice questions, you need to provide options that _lead_ the reader to the correct answer. <n><n>Think of options C and D as "false leads" - we would never describe a task by asking "where does John want to go?" or where is "somewhere else". <n><n>Also watch out for options B and E - they are good attempts at describing an intention, but would not have led us to the right answer.<n><n>This is a useful way of thinking for any writing: what's at the core of the intention I'm describing?<n><n>You can answer this instruction by stating: "John wanted to be somewhere else."<n><n>### Concepts: This example has focused on a single line, but each question is made up of individual words and syntax. <n><n>If you have found some of the questions in this exercise difficult, don't despair! <n><n>You should have noticed that the examples are progressively more difficult, they get more complex and require more understanding of sentence syntax and structure. <n><n>However, your initial understanding is limited - and that's OK! <n><n>You can expect to not fully understand all of this knowledge - it'll take you a long time before you can actually write like it. <n><n>To help you navigate these materials and learn how to write well, we have some guidelines. <n><n>### Guidelines: <n><n>You should take these guidelines to heart! <n><n>The instruction below is notoriously difficult to answer, but we're confident you can get to grips with how to write like it.

A great way to check if the word fits the sentence is to read through the sentence. If the sentence does not make sense when the word is substituted, it does not fit. In the given example below, it doesn't make any sense (incomplete) when we replace the 'active' word with any of the five other words given in the brackets (except the one we used).<n><n>For e.g. _Sometimes it felt like his only reason for making money was BEING able to pay bills (which does not make any sense)_. It just makes sense if we replace the highlighted words with 'active'. <n><n>**Notes**: (if any)<n>

This is the maximum amount of data the disk drive can actually hold. You may not be able to use all the 60 kilo-bytes at once but you can store the data.<n><n>Incorrect-This statement is wrong because the computer does not have a disk drive. It has a hard drive and it can write more than 64kB on it.<n><n>### Examples of other incorrect statements:<n><n>- 64kB 5 12 bits; the highest address in a 16-bit bus is 65535 (hex). 65536 is undefined, and if you address beyond it, you crash.<n>- You cannot put the entire human genome into a hard drive because there isn't enough room.<n><n>### Other computer questions that are difficult to answer:<n><n>### Question:<n>"How many kilobytes are there in a petabyte?"<n><n>### Answer<n>"256 kb?"<n><n>### Exactly<n>"Actually there are 1,024 kilobytes in every petabyte."<n><n>### Notes:<n>- A petabyte is equal to 1000000 GB.<n><n>### What can you conclude about this question:<n><n>### I know you have been trying to answer this question: 1024^2(256^20)^8(2048^10)^8(1) =   10^116<n><n>### Your answer is technically correct but it is not a correct answer.

The input can come in a variety of forms and will change from task to task. The output may be plain text, a string, an integer, an object, or just about anything you can think of. The output is not returned directly to the user, but is sent to a logging utility such as Log4J. Remember, you are writing a utility that is designed to be used over and over, so your utility should be as generalized as possible. Also, some of the inputs might be incorrect, which means that you will probably need to validate the input. To make your life a little easier, you will be given a collection of helper functions to use. You are not required to understand these functions, you only need to know how to use them.<n><n>### Help<n>As stated before, to assist you, we have already coded a few helper functions for you to use. Here they are:<n>* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|* <n>* (1) Input - Gets a line of user input.<n>* (2) Lowercase - converts a string s to lowercase.<n>* (3) Uppercase - converts a string to uppercase.<n>* (4) Split - splits a string into an array.<n>* (5) Split-To-Array - converts a string into an array using delimiters. This will take in a string and split on delimiters, and return an array containing the split values. You will need to return a variable of type `String[]`<n>* (6) ToLower -  converts a string to lowercase.<n>    * ---------------------------------------------------------------------|*<n>    * To use these functions simply write a variable name followed by the function<n>    name in lower case, like this: <n>    * ---------------------|* <n>    * user = (1) Input()<n>

In response to this I would say that it was a very intricate machinery. The reason why I would say that is because of the sentence, “It was quite an apparatus” which means that it is a device that could perform a task by someone.<n><n>Next, a question has been asked about the petrol. The answer to the question is the same as the question.

The answer to this question is the same as another previous question that was asked, and I would not say anything different, and the reason for this is because the television will be used at night so that you can watch the TV at night.

Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are many things to note from the answer. To a, in most cases you will need to expose yourself to new things for you to get to know them better. To b and c, you will have to be patient especially when it comes to cooperation, no one wants you to get to where you want being at a corner and all they will tell you is give it time. They will say it does not come easy, it takes time, we can be patient and still go on with whatever it is that we are doing. On to d, you will not be able to get to anywhere you want be you have to work on it. Cooperation is an important factor. One who goes by himself, or herself, it takes so long since you are your own judge and jury with your decisions. You will always be the one who goes against your decisions, and with all this time, one might be able to accomplish what one wanted to achieve with the help from those you considered your opponents, hence making them your allies.

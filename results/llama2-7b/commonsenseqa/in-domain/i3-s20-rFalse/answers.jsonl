It is expected that the user will enter commands to move cursor in the document. The program allows the user to perform three main operations, namely move upward by one line, move downward by one line and go to start or end (depending on the cursor position). The user has option to go back to start or continue from current cursor position.\n\nThe first part is a menu\n\nYou have successfully started a simple document viewer\n\n[MENU]\n\n  [1] Move upward by one line\n  [2] Move downward by one line\n[3] Go to start or end (based on cursor position)\n\n[BACK] (Go back to last command selected)\n1. 2. 3. 4. (Move forward to next command)\n\nYou have entered incorrect number of arguments. The arguments should be numbered within braces to allow to read the arguments from standard input. e.g. a[b,c,d] will print the argument values in that order.\n\nEnter the command to be executed, or -1 to quit.\n\nMove up by 1\nMove down by 1\nGo to start or end depending on the current cursor position\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\\$\\end{code}\n\n\\section{Expected behavior}\n\nIn the program, a user has to enter choices from a menu. The main program is `if` statement to check whether any key is pressed or not. In this case, it must be recognized that while the user is typing the choice from the menu, the user will not press the enter key.\n\nAs a result, an `if` statement should be set up for the `getch()` function (for example) which means wait for a key press and then the corresponding choice will be set up.\n\n\\section{Source code}\n\nThe source code of the program is below.\n\n\\begin{code}\n#include<stdio.h>\n#include<string.h", "answer": "A: sights"}

G.H.I\nOutput: H: Hi\n\n\n### Explanations:\n\n### Question 1\nThis question is to see if you know how to use the parser to check spelling in a token. The program that checks spelling in tokens is the spelling checker. It goes through and finds every token and then checks to see if there are any errors. It returns an error when it finds an error. The answer is a spellcheck parser.\n\n### Question2\nWe first look at looking for the correct pronoun. The question wants us to look for the right pronoun according to the the word. We use the lookAt function to first find if there is a pronoun that matches and if it exists. If there is not, we need to look at the following words until we find something that matches. If there is not a word that matches or we do not get a match, then a match is not found. The program checks for a match at the third token which is what I put in for the input. If there is a word that matches the machine, then the answer is yes. If there is no word that matches the machine then the answer is no.\n\n###Question3\nWe want to check to see if there is an abbreviation, so we look for (A, B, C etc) that matches between the second and the third tokens. Our lookAt function checks for the letter and its index value at the same time. If the letter is not in the index, then we assume that there is no abbreviation at the time being. Abbreviations use lowercase letters. Our answer is if there is an (abbreviation), then its is yes. Otherwise, we answer no to the question.\n\n###Example4\nThe parser searches for the words I put in for the question, the second and third tokens. Because two words are found, and the token after are found to be correct, the answer is yes.\n\n###Explanation5\nWhen we were talking about pronouns, I said that if we do not find a pronoun that matches", "answer": "A: beast"}

The what is used for indefinite singular nouns, such as books, animals, places, and things. It is also used for indefinite names of organizations, teams and companies. The what is also used for some uncountable nouns, such a glass of water and some tea. It is also used to refer to things in an unclear place, this may describe the state of something, such as a broken machine. An indefinite word is a word that is not stated and may have more than one meaning. While the indefinite pronoun what is used in a sentence, it is the most common pronoun (word to refer a person, place or thing). The what refers to something or someone unknown, unspecified or indefinite. For example: What a lovely tree! It is amazing How can anyone be so ignorant? I think there's a what there, don't you? It is the way the What has been used in this example that has confused you, you can say that there could have been a cat in that tree, or an unknown person/thing. You can only use the indefinite pronounce what to refer to things in general, not to refer to an unknown or indefinite subject. The what is used to ask questions, such as: What shall we do now? What's this? The what is also one of the shortest words in the English alphabet \u2013 it has just one letters! It is sometimes used without any preposition before it, for example: \u201cIt is just a what but it is so cute!\".\n\nInput2:Can nouns function as an Adjective, Noun, Verb and Pronoun? How do you make nouns function like an Adjective, Nou, Verb and Pronou?\nOutput2:  The nouns in English grammar are classified as either common or proper.

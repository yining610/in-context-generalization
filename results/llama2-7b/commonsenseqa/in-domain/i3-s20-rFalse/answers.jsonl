{"text": "I hope I have understood you correctly, as I have been instructed to answer your questions in which you wanted, I believe after reading all the questions I will find my correct answers to your questions.\n\n### I think, after seeing your questions and doing some little research, I have found some answers. I believe that the first question is the right answer. I believe that the answers to the first question that you asked to me is the type machine that was very intricate. I believe that the answer to this question is \"A: apparatus.\" This is because an apparatus is a machine, that it is a complex machine. I believe that is why this would be the right answer.\n\n### The second question is: \"Where do you get petrol?\" I have found out that \"petrol\" is not a word or anything that people use, and it is not the same as fuel, either. I found out that petrol is British English. But then again in British English; it is a slang way of saying gasoline, and fuel is another term that people call \"Gasoline.\" And in American English, the way people say it is \"Gasoline,\" and in British English, it is just called petrol, also when people need fuel, they will say gas; they will not say petrol and this is confusing. I hope this means it is a correct answer because I do not know what this question means, and I do not know what the questions mean.\n\nHowever, after doing this task and searching for the right answer, I have learnt that there could be many different types of terms that people can use for fuel that could mean gasoline, or petrol. And if that was not confusing enough, after looking up some more words and searching for an answer, I found out that Gasoline is a brand name that was created in the United States in 1865, and in England, they call it petrol.\n\nIf you take a look at the picture, I have decided to put pictures of gasoline and petrol because they are both terms that people use for fuel, but they all call it gasoline. In Britain, they call it petroleum, and in America, they call it gasoline. And there are many different slang sayings for both terms. I have also put a picture of fuel tank, and car to show you an example of different ways to call petrol or fuels.", "answer": "C: backyard"}

{"text": "* ANSWER: B: inside the book*\n* WHY: A: The correct answer would have been \u201cinside the book\u201d because it matches with the question, that was what the man was asked. For instance, if the question were, \u201cWhere do you get cheese?,\u201d one would respond, \u201cIn a grocery store.\u201d ANSWER: The word \u201cinside\u201d is important because it follows the verb \u201creturn\u201d in the question, which fits with \u201cinside a book\u201d in the answer. (\u201cHe had an index card (verb) he had to return, [so he put it] inside the book.\u201d [answer]) The word \u201cso\u201d begins the question, which is not part of the answer, and \u201cbook\u201d makes more sense and is more inclusive than \u201cthe book\u201d\u2014that is why E and C would be incorrect. ANSWER: \u201cReturn\u201d is the verb in the question, and is the past participle form of the verb \u201creturn,\u201d and the participle form can be used as an adverb, in which case it can describe the process and location. In this instance, since the man was returning the card, he \u201cput the card inside the book.\u201d The \u201cbook\u201d would have been where the card was returned. ANSWER/INFORMATION: This question contains a run-on sentence because the question contains a conjunction (\u201cso\u201d) and \u201cwhere.\u201d\n* ANSWERS: A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not match the question in any way.\n* ANSWED: C: library is not correct because it does not match the question. In addition, a library card cannot be \u201creturned,\u201d and so could not be put inside the book.\n\n### Inputs:How many years was he in the army? Choices: 1) 17 A: the correct answer 2) 18.

{"text": "### Dear Mr/Ms Manager\n\nThank you for the opportunity to explain how to improve the food drive. The task of collecting food requires the employee to have a variety of appliances, including a fridge and a car to deliver the food.\n\nThere are different ways in which they can make an improvement. Firstly they may consider picking more containers for food. Secondly they could consider picking containers from stores that would be more likely to have a customer willing to donate food - such as grocery stores that serve richer areas.\n\nFinally the employee could consider picking more often. After a week a delivery of groceries would be better received than a single delivery of groceries over a month.\n\nI believe that picking more than one item from a store would be beneficial. This means that the employee would be able to access more clients and would be expected to donate to the cause.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n### Response2:\n\n### The task manager is expecting to improve the food drive for the food bank. The employee is required to make adjustments to the food drive process to increase the total amount of donations. The employee will need to improve their process. The answer that would be correct is picking more often.\n\n### The employee needs to improve their process because there are several areas where improvements can be made.\n\nFirst they could consider picking more containers. This would require having a variety of appliences with them. This would mean they would have a cool box in their fridge on a hot day and they would also have a food container to take to the bank on the same day.\n\nSecondly the employee should pick containers from stores that would have more people willing to donate food. It is possible that they will have a better chance of success by picking from a store that is located along a bus corridor than a store that is not located along a bus corrdior.\n\nFinally they could pick more often. This means that they would make shorter trips and would be more willing to go back to a particular store for more donations. In addition the food would be fresher when it was picked on a day after it had been made.\n\nI believe they would be better off choosing to pick more from local stores that have people who would be more willing to contribute food.\n\n### Response 3", "answer": "E: grocery store"}

Even though bubblegum is sometimes composed of latex, chewing gum (like any other piece of candy) is safe to ingest. The only times you might have a problem with chewing gum is if you already have an intestinal blockage or if you have intestinal conditions that make you very susceptible to blockages. Even though there have been some reported cases of blockages, eating gum is not known to be a contributing factor.\n\n### Reason2: Because it has a very low risk of causing choking or airway obstruction, even though it might feel uncomfortable for a few hours.\n\nSwallowing gum seems to be extremely safe. It could get stuck on the inside of your cheek, which isn't unpleasant and might even feel relaxing. The only problem chewing gum might cause is if it gets stuck in the throat, causing choking. Although it doesn't appear to have happened often enough to be an accepted hazard, it's still possible for a piece of gum to get stuck in the back of your throat (especially if you're having a hard time swallowing).

If no element satisfies the conditions, return an empty element of an array.\n\n\n### Methods\nHere are some methods that will help  you write the function.\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction highestAsciiValue(array) {\n  // Write your code here\nreturn 0;\n}\n```\n\n###  Solution\nThe following solution demonstrates a method that  returns an element from an array given with the highest ASCII value, where the elements are in lower case. If there is no character in the array that contains the highest ASCII the function returns an array with an empty element.\n\n\n## Challenge:\n\n### Instructions:\nIf you were writing a song, you would have to know what chords to use. If you were writing a song for a beginner, what are some chords that you might use for the song?\n\n### Method:\nWhen using the method, I tried to use Dsus2, C, and F minor. For each time I used a chord in a series I needed to repeat it because I was not writing the chords with all the other chords so I made it repeat itself. However, the methods that I used didn\u2019t work well because I had to keep creating new songs.\n\n## Instruction:\n\n### Write a paragraph or two about a way to generate music without using computers or musical instruments.\n\n## Methods:\nWhen using the computer I found another method of creating music with the keyboard by making loops and sounds. For example, if you have a series of notes you can make a loop of the sound you recorded so the computer can recognize the sound and repeat it. In order to create more than one sound, you can add other sounds to the loop.\n\nTo repeat a sound you can record a note as a loop and play the sound as many times as you would like. Then, you can make a copy of the loop by holding down the keys and drag it to the copy icon on the keyboard then the computer will repeat the sound.\n\n## Instructions:\n\n### Demos", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

A great way to check if the word fits the sentence is to read through the sentence. If the sentence does not make sense when the word is substituted, it does not fit. In the given example below, it doesn't make any sense (incomplete) when we replace the 'active' word with any of the five other words given in the brackets (except the one we used).\n\nFor e.g. _Sometimes it felt like his only reason for making money was BEING able to pay bills (which does not make any sense)_.

This is the maximum amount of data the disk drive can actually hold. You may not be able to use all the 60 kilo-bytes at once but you can store the data.\n\nIncorrect-This statement is wrong because the computer does not have a disk drive. It has a hard drive and it can write more than 64kB on it.\n\n### Examples of other incorrect statements:\n\n- 64kB 5 12 bits; the highest address in a 16-bit bus is 65535 (hex). 65536 is undefined, and if you address beyond it, you crash.\n- You cannot put the entire human genome into a hard drive because there isn't enough room.\n\n### Other computer questions that are difficult to answer:\n\n### Question:\n\"How many kilobytes are there in a petabyte?\"\n\n### Answer\n\"256 kb?\"\n\n### Exactly\n\"Actually there are 1,024 kilobytes in every petabyte.\"\n\n### Notes:\n- A petabyte is equal to 1000000 GB.\n\n### What can you conclude about this question:\n\n### I know you have been trying to answer this question: 1024^2(256^20)^8(2048^10)^8(1) =   10^116\n\n### Your answer is technically correct but it is not a correct answer.

The input can come in a variety of forms and will change from task to task. The output may be plain text, a string, an integer, an object, or just about anything you can think of. The output is not returned directly to the user, but is sent to a logging utility such as Log4J. Remember, you are writing a utility that is designed to be used over and over, so your utility should be as generalized as possible. Also, some of the inputs might be incorrect, which means that you will probably need to validate the input. To make your life a little easier, you will be given a collection of helper functions to use. You are not required to understand these functions, you only need to know how to use them.\n\n### Help\nAs stated before, to assist you, we have already coded a few helper functions for you to use. Here they are:\n* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|* \n* (1) Input - Gets a line of user input.\n* (2) Lowercase - converts a string s to lowercase.\n* (3) Uppercase - converts a string to uppercase.\n* (4) Split - splits a string into an array.\n* (5) Split-To-Array - converts a string into an array using delimiters. This will take in a string and split on delimiters, and return an array containing the split values. You will need to return a variable of type `String[]`\n* (6) ToLower -  converts a string to lowercase.\n    * ---------------------------------------------------------------------|*\n    * To use these functions simply write a variable name followed by the function\n    name in lower case, like this: \n    * ---------------------|* \n    * user = (1) Input()", "answer": "D: contaminated"}

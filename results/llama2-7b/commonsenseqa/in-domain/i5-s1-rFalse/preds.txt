E: an apple<n>Output: B: orange  (You can only use objects that are related to what is being searched for)<n><n>Example 1: What kind of fruit is the answer and how do you know it is banana?<n><n>It's an orange, and we know this because apples are fruits, as are oranges.

The questions are meant to be a type of code breaker, with each answer describing a function or concept found in the computer. Create this project as a single python file (in Jupyter) and save as code3.py in your new folder.  <n><n>### Detailed Instructions:<n>  - Choose a variable (for example, name, city) that could be an argument to the function print_name, print_city, etc.<n>  - Then, define a function whose parameters include a variable for print and a variable for arg.<n>  - The function should print arg + name.<n>  - When the function gets called in the following manner: printname(arg, city) the first parameter for printname should be the function name and the second parameter should be the argument + city.<n>  - When called in this manner printargs(arg, name) the first parameter for the function should be the function name, the second parameter should be name, and the third parameter should be arg.<n>  - You'll have to do more than two calls to printname and printargs within your main. However, do not overgeneralize your printname and printargs functions. You'll end up with a bunch of redundancy where you can only test for and print one variable.<n>  - Create and call at least five printname calls that do not include a redundant printname call. Likewise, do not call print name in more than two functions. You should use at least two different print name calls within main.<n><n>``` <n>from CodeSearch.codeSearch import CodeSearch<n><n>codeSearch =(CodeSearch("."))<n><n>codeSearch.print_name("John")<n>codeSearch.printargs("Rick", "Frank")<n>```<n>

[Here, on the main page](https://coderevie.wpdevs.co/questions/50/how-do-i-write-a-good-code-review-question/60#60) we have guidelines on how to write a well formulated and descriptive Question itself.<n><n>Comment: Thanks for the comment! I did look up and take a moment to read into the help, but I couldn't find what you specified exactly on there. Are you referring to someplace different?

In my opinion, this is a "bad" kind of questions, because you should see the code itself, and look for other "good" questions.<n><n>Comment: I don't understand how to put a comment on your comments? Is that possible to do so?<n><n>Comment: Maybe the reason you got zero views is because you didn't specify an IDE (i.e. Eclipse, JetBrains, Visual Studio, etc). Also, there are no real 'good', and 'bad' questions (unless you were trying to be funny). Code Review isn't a joke site.<n><n>Comment: A lot of things are going on here.<n><n>Comment: _I don't understand how_?

In the above program, "input2" is declared locally, but every method that receives a variable of type input2 has access to the same variable. All arrays and ArrayLists accesses are made to the array/ArrayList referenced in the variable, not the variable, so passing an ArrayList as a parameter actually alters the List of the receiving method.<n><n>An array/ArrayList is passed by value, i.e., the method gets a copy of the original array/ArrayList.

The "question", each word has a letter (e.g: "Where is the ___?"), and they come in a certain position (e.g: the place with the letter "L") (or more likely the letter doesn't have any position), for example,<n>```javascript<n>const answer_01 = document.getElementById("01");<n>const letter01 = answer_01.firstChild.nodeValue;<n><n>if(letter01 === "L") {<n>    debugger;<n>}<n>```<n><n>2. Now you're here and you decide to check every letter and that takes a long time. So you could check to get the first word and remove the first word to remove the first one. Next, the second one, again, you need to check every letter and remove it from the string.<n><n>Then you could check every other letter by taking the first two letters and removing the first 3 letters. It can seem very repetitive.<n><n>3. If you're writing in typescript it will help you to prevent some error such as:<n>* `1:188 TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined`<n>```javascript<n>const firstNameResponse = input.firstChild.nodeName;<n>```<n><n>  But typescript will warn you that the input object is `undefined`, or `input` doesn't have any of this properties then you'll have to check it.<n>

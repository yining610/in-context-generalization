Since no one else in the scenario is angry, and a friend or life aren't even named in the question, we eliminate the possibilities of \"a friend's face\" (A) and \"her life\" (E).\n\nWhen determining the meaning of \"mad, it will most likely be a noun:\n\nThe \"her\" before \"husband's face\" (D) tells us that this is a sentence about a woman and her relationship to the person. It is likely that \"she was mad\" (B) refers to her state of mind, while \"her husband's voice\" (C) refers to something she's hearing. \n\n\"Her life\" (E) refers to her whole life.

The first-person pronoun \"they\" refers to a specific person, indicating that the question is about that person, rather than a generic individual. The fact that the person \"had borrowed\" the card suggests that they intended to return it to its original owner.\n\nThe following is another statement:\n\nIf a person in question did not have the card, the response would be an empty or \"false\" answer. However, the question has a clear sense of identity and emphasises borrowing and return to the mother.\nA person who returns the card after borrowing it from their mother is not at all an empty or false answer.\n\nSo the final answer the person in question is not empty or false, which is the answer B.\n\nInput:The problem of \"Who ate all the cake?\" was what problem it was a problem with Choices: A: A person  B: Finding and stopping Boss \nC: No one D: Cake \nOutput: Reason\n\nReading the prompt closely reveals that it presents a series of scenarios that would be considered problems, but that are not actually problems per se.\n\nIn essence, the problem is \"Who had all the cake?\" As the options are all about stopping or finding something, a boss would also be affected.

However, it doesn't fit because neighborhoods normally don't have gates on them. \"Subdivision\" fits the context of the question, but it is vague on exactly which type of \"subdivision\" he should start looking for. \"City\" is more specific, implying that he is trying to buy a home inside the city limits of a large urban area, and is not trying to live on a mountain or rural part of the countryside. However, \"city\" also doesn't fit, because most cities don't have a wall or a gate around them. \"Suburb\" (D), like \"city,\" is defined as part of a larger metropolis, though not necessarily a rural place.

Since the body was mentioned in the question, and there are many forms of illness, an all-encompassing option is not appropriate. Eating too much dinner may also cause acid reflux, but, as mentioned before, acid reflux should not be considered a \"form\" of illness. In addition, the options are very general and they would fail to address specific details of eating too much dinner. Therefore, there wouldn't be any real \"proof\" in such choices.\n\nThe remaining options A, C, D, and E are all inappropriate, too. It's unlikely that eating dinner too much would lead to tiredness, since tiredness may result from many other factors, including lack of exercise or insufficient sleep.\n\nIt's also inappropriate to apply \"tired\" to eating too much dinner, because it's just one of many consequences that could occur. In addition, the question doesn't explicitly list all of the consequences.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is C: living longer.\n\nInput: How would you define \"conservation\"?

It is also the only reasonable choice. Since the context of the question contains the word \"conservation\" in the question, the word \"economy\" most likely means to \"e", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nFirst we have to make use of clues such as grammar choice and context to infer what kind of \"what\" we are looking for. For example, if the question said \"Which type of what\" instead of \"What was possible...\" then we could easily answer \"apple\", because we know \"apple\" is a type of \"what\". If we do not see a clear choice of words in such a situation, then the answer must be one of the remaining possibilities.\n\nNext, we need to make a strong guess at what is the context of the sentence, and see if it matches up with any of the remaining answers. In this sentence, the context seems to be a situation in which something happened, and we are trying to figure it out. The situation may be in the past, for example \"I did not know what was happening yesterday\". This indicates that the context could potentially be a story, or a sequence of actions which occurred.\n\nThe rest of the sentence is fairly consistent with the idea of \"which is possible\", and so \"impossibility\", or \"cant do\" is the best answer in this case.\n\nInput:There exist an enormous number of elements that the human body depends on for survival. One example is the carbon which what? Choices: A: absorbed B: used C: taken D: eaten E: needed\nOutput:Reason:\n\nThe key to the question lies in the clue to which phrase to use.

Choices:  B: cats  C: dogs  D: fish  E: birds\nOutput: Reason (answer) :\n\nThere is a popular adage which says \"when it rains cats & dogs\" it rains excessively and that is probably the reason for the occurrence of floods or thunders\n\nThere is also another similar adage that is \"It's raining cats and dogs\" which means that the rain is heavy and also the weather is rough\n\nThe probability of such heavy rain would be unlikely because in such a case people would not celebrate Christmas in outdoors and would have Christmas celebrations in their homes, so that is the reason for selecting the option \"inside\" (B)\n\nSo the correct answer is B: inside\n\nInput: The question at hand is, what happens when you mix chocolate milk and strawberry milk together?

You might even say it would be their house, or trouble. For me, it just didn't sound right. Let's just say you interpret it in a way that makes you think it could literally mean anything.\n\nWhile chewing up a house wouldn't make much sense, it would make absolute sense to chew up a dog's mouth.\n\nSince the question asks you to choose an answer, it's important to note", "answer": "D: trouble"}

There would be no practical use for the chair but it would be a place to temporarily store the chair.\n\nOption 'B' is incorrect because if you did not plan on using it, there would really be no need to put the chair in a school. You could probably put the chair in the closet at your home.\n\nOption 'C' is incorrect because although a beach could be considered a location, the question specifies that you would need large doors to move the entire chair there.\n\nOption 'D' is incorrect because there is no need to put the foldable chair in a garage if there are no large doors needed to get it there. You could just put it in any other room in your house.\nOption 'E' is incorrect because the question specifies that there are no large doors to put the chair in.

Option D sounds like it could be the best answer, as it does not include any spelling errors and gives an accurate description of where a sushi restaurant could be found.\n\nHowever, option E describes the location as being \"in the Atlantic Ocean\", which is incorrect as it is unlikely that sushi is served raw in the ocean. \n\nTherefore the most fitting answer is option D, in the fish market\n\nSo the answer is: answer (bill).

It could be sharing the vision of what the team is working on, or maybe a new plan for the project. However, it's not very likely information would be shared as generalized as \"a new project\", unless the project was already underway. \n\nOption \"check on new ideas\" (E) sounds like a great option too, but again, is not specific with what exactly the boss wanted to check on regarding that. It's unclear if the boss wanted to verify an idea itself or the idea's progress.\n\nLastly, the most sensible option is \"giving an offer of a new project\" (D). It could very well have been the case that the boss gave an offer of a project to the interns, as a means of making sure the interns are productive and engaged in work that will boost the company. This way, there's a sense of accomplishment for both the boss and the interns once the project is completed.\n\nConsequently, an answer of D is the best option\n\nInput: The intern in computer science school are currently on a project", "answer": "E: meet"}

The context doesn't specify where it is being played in but the world cup is being played in Russia, so option \"outside\" (E) should be the next choice to eliminate.\n\nNext is \"D: Outside\". Even though this seems more intuitive than \"E: World Cup\", this term doesn't specify where the soccer field would be located if not contained in a building. Because of this, it is easier to eliminate.\n\nThis leaves the other 3 choices: A, B, and D.\n\nIf the context of the question was the location of the soccer field was Russia, then it would only need to be identified on a map as \"outside\". No other further information needed.\n\nContext: \"Outside\"?\n\nNow, let's examine options \"A\" and \"B\".

We can solve this without doing any multiplication. If we start from the right-hand side, we can see that 548 and 287 cubed give 27.14 and 18.37 cubes respectively. We start by subtracting 27.1 cubes from 18.3 cubes and end up with 3.4 cubes.\n\nA more straightforward way to get that result is just subtracting 3.4 from 287 and then rounding to three digits.\n\nInput:If the train was on the move, does 8400 meters have 9600 or 18400 meters in front of it?

Therefore, the hot pavement would be one of the two locations he ran to.\n\nThe first three options (A, B and C) are clearly inaccurate. Bob didn't run barefoot to a bed of nails. He didn't run to a town. And he didn't run to an attractive woman. All of these options would require walking, not running, and thus do not fit the description of a place where his feet hurt.\n\nFinally option D is correct. Based on the context, we know Bob had to travel to run from the corner to his home. We also know he lost his shoes on the hot pavement, so it would follow that whatever he ran to was located in a neighborhood or on a city block where he did not have shoes. And \"attractive consistent look\" (D) describes the layout of the city block pretty well.\n\nSo the final answer would be \"city block\" (D)\n\nInput: What is the first number, and what is the last number, that satisfy the following conditions?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first thing to ask yourself is whether the options A-E describe the same object, or are describing different objects altogether. Since an option like \"massless\" would obviously describe something very different from, say, \"massive\", we can rule out the option A. \n\nWe can also rule out the options B and D, which do not make sense for the same reason: they both describe the object as being very small, where an object like a building would generally be big. \n\nThis leaves us with options C, E and F. The option C describes the building as \"dwarf\", and while this would fit the description of a building not well constructed, a question like this one wouldn't make sense in a science-related context.\n\nThat leaves the options E and F. Option E describes the building as \"good\", which is a correct word but would not make sense to call a massive building which hasn't been properly built\n\nThe answer is F: good\n\nInput: What was the first name given to the first person in the world to reach the top of Mount Everest?

C could describe Margaret or Ruth. However, there is no mention of Margaret or Ruth in the scenario, so the information available is either insufficient to eliminate any of these options or insufficient to choose an answer from the remaining options. As a result, it does not follow that C or E must be the answer to the question. \n\nSimilarly, E may seem to describe a woman, but we do not know what the first name would be.\n\nAs a result, the answer to the question is F: Iva.", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe scenario suggests that people are likely to continue talking because they're learning new things. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that people continue talking because of \"discomfort\" (C), because no mention is made of such a reaction.\n\nOption \"agreement\" (A) may seem intuitive at first glance, but it doesn't fully capture the scenario. Simply because there is an exchange of new information with friends does not mean that the discussion leads to \"agreement.\" For example, if someone were to tell a friend about a new recipe, the discussion might not produce a consensus, but rather spark new questions and ideas. \n\nOption \"to fill their time\" (B) is also unlikely. While people may talk simply to pass the time, it is not the main purpose of the conversation. People talk to socialize, not simply to fill an empty moment.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining options are \"learning about\" (E) and \"misunderstanding\" (D). While \"learning about\" seems like the most likely answer, it is also the most specific one, while \"misunderstanding\" is more vague. Since it's not specified that the conversation is a misunderstanding, the correct answer is \"learning about\" (D).\n\nInput: Suppose that I ask my boss for the reason why he is always out of office when I need to meet him. For what situation, then, would he most likely be out of office? Choices:  I: out of town II: working late III: on a business trip IV: in the restroom V: in the office\nOutput : Answer:\n\nThe question suggests I would likely ask my boss's whereabouts while he's away from the office, but option (II) is incorrect. Out-of-town, out-of-office, and out-of-office hours are all distinct concepts, and all of them describe the boss's time away from the office. While he is out of town, he would be away from the office and might be using an out-of-office response - thus, option (II) is not specific enough. \n\nOption (III) is not likely because out-of-office does not refer to a business trip, and it does not refer to a meeting with me either. A business trip only refers to travel, so it cannot be the situation", "answer": "E: learning about"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nOption \"completed sentence\" (A) is not necessary. The choice would be the same if the person had his money stolen or his life savings were all transferred to his sibling's account, or just the $10 or $100 you thought you left in your wallet. That is, a completed sentence is only an example, and the outcome would remain the same.\n\nOption \"feel angry\" (B) is plausible. But, again, anger isn't an outcome that is necessary to have \"happened\" to a person. If someone's car gets totaled in a crash, but he or she is in an overall happy and healthy state of being, anger isn't something we can guarantee he or she would feel.\n\nOption \"drink tea\" (C) is too specific to consider. Drinking tea is a nonessential action a person might do if his or her money were stolen -- it's an action that might help the person cope with feelings of helplessness or anger. But, again, it's a nonessential action that isn't necessarily related to the outcome of money theft.\n\nOption \"cross the street\" (D) is, of course, an action people take every day if someone or something crosses their path. It's a common occurrence, and crossing the street isn't an outcome of the theft.\n\nLastly, option \"park\" (E) is a verb that, similar to crossing the street, is an action that anyone might do if someone or something is in their way. But again, just like option \"cross the street,\" no one can guarantee if they will park their car or not. It's an action that someone takes -- but the outcome is not parking one's car in general.\n\nSo the correct answer is E: Park\n\nInput: The teacher asked her English class to write a paragraph about the history of their town.

It's immediately easy to eliminate pool, which would be the opposite of the statement \"I meant the pool\". And we know the correct choice isn't country club (A), because being worried about being thought to be in a \"rich person's house\" and being worried of thinking someone will think you're \"at the other end\" of a country club are completely different.\n\nLet's look at the remaining two choices:\n\nFitness center (E) is a common location for squash courts - a search for \"pool vs. squash courts\" would return results indicating that many public pools include squash courts as part of their facility. The phrase \"at the other end of the park\" might be used in reference to public parks which contain squash courts. \n\nSince the friend isn't worried that his friend will think he went to his house but to a public park, Fitness center (E), would have to be the correct answer. \n\nInput:I'm leaving early tomorrow, don't wake me up.What am I doing the early what?

An \"own home\" (D) would refer to the homeowner, not their attic. A \"top of home\" (B) is likely to contain valuable art, but nothing old.

{"text": "A) \"Attached\" (A) in a practical sense means \"strongly affixed.\" In the given context, it's unlikely that someone would be \"strongly affixed to a remote control\" in the sense that they adhered onto it physically in any way, and thus this answer seems unlikely. \n\nB) \"Nostalgic\" (B) may also carry the implication that a person would carry strong emotional attachment to the remote control, and they indeed seem fond of the object. However, it could just as easily mean that they have a fond nostalgic memory of using in the past, as opposed to a strong emotional affection for it presently. Hence, this word would have to be analyzed in the context of the previous word given to gauge the level of \"attachment\" it's describing. \n\nC) \"Companionable\" (C) refers to a company or a familiarity that people share. It wouldn't be correct to apply this term to a piece of inanimate object. Hence this seems unlikely. \nD) \"Likely\" (D) is a word that indicates possibility. When put together with \"feel\", it creates a vague emotional context that could describe a wide range of feelings between dislike and extreme fondness. Contrast this with \"close\", which is the last choice on the list. \"Close\" expresses a concrete, measurable amount of closeness. A close emotional bond doesn't sound as likely as a close physical proximity. Hence, it's the more logical choice here. \n\nE) \"Close\" (E) in a practical sense defines physical proximity. It may be used in a figurative sense as well, but any figurative interpretation of \"close\" in this context would be less likely than a direct reference to the geographic proximity of the remote control.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first, and most important, thing to understand with the first sentence is to acknowledge and recognize the specific words that are being used and how they tie into the rest of the passage. \n\nSpecifically, the word \"vast\" is doing heavy and expressive work in the first sentence. We see that this word is used to describe what the camper sees, so we can logically infer that whatever the camper sees must be relatively large and expansive in nature.\n\nTo build on that thought, it would be helpful to consider the word \"vast\", in contrast to another word which is the antonym: small. When we have an understanding of what \"vast\" means, it automatically creates an understanding of what \"small\" means in relation. And because \"vast\" is so much larger in scale than \"small\", we can easily determine that anything that would be comparable or even remotely similar in size to vast is relatively large.\n\nTherefore, from this understanding, it immediately makes sense to eliminate the option \"insignificant\" (B), because while it may be possible for something to be smaller than vast, the word \"small\" cannot be applied to vast. If it could, it would not be as big of a word to describe something as vast.\n\nSimilarly, we then eliminate the option \"unimportant\" (A), because of how the word \"important\" opposes the word \"unimportant\" in the dictionary. So if those two words are antonyms in dictionaries, there can't be something larger in scale that is smaller in significance. And if that is the case, there can be no options that contain \"smaller\" next to it.\n\nBesides those terms of comparison, we can see that there must be something special about the camper's view. We don't get any sense that he was simply in amazement, because there is no expression that would imply the camper was that amazed by whatever he was looking at, nor is expressive enough. If you look at the sentence again, specifically the \"feeling mighty\" part, it is used sarcastically to make fun of someone. So, we can then infer that the camper must have felt rather powerful.\n\nAnd we can come to this conclusion by looking at how the sentence is structured. We have \"The camper looked up\" first.", "answer": "B: insignificant"}

None of them are actually required to teach students, and in fact, the former two would be things that the instructor would want to avoid during the teaching process.\n\nOption \"time\" (D) is plausible but unclear in its context. While giving children time is a necessary part of teaching, it doesn't answer the question regarding what is needed for proper instruction.

You need simply guess the answers, or select an incorrect answer as your guess.\n\nThe first sentence describes a tidy person who is putting a dictionary in place. By taking the words into consideration, we can see that this is probably a person who is at home, at their leisure, and possibly a person who has a job that might be related to reading or writing. But if this is the case, what kind of dictionary are we referring to?\n\nIn addition, the sentence mentions that the dictionary is loose. That would more likely happen during your study, a class where a student is taking notes from a dictionary, or an older student using a dictionary. So a dictionary in that context would belong on a desk. If it were on the shelf, we would think that the student was in a library or reading area.\n\nThus we choose \"desk\" as our answer, since we are dealing with a person who is at leisure, in a home environment, with an important note-taking tool (a dictionary).\n\n\n\nInput: What type of plant is the one pictured? Choices:  Cactus B: Palm tree C: Orchid D: Dracaena E: Ficus\nOutput: Reason\n\nYou must be very familiar with cactus' flowers in order for the sentence, \"Flowering cacti\", to make sense.\n\nHowever, we are probably talking about a plant in the United States or some other place where people take care of their gardens and plants. And therefore, the first option could well be true, since we are asking about a flower.\n\nThe next thought was, \"what if it's a plant they have to take care of? We'd have to think of the possibility that it's an indoor plant.\"\n\nThen we noticed that the letter \"C\" was used, which stood for \"cactus\", and the letter \"D\" was left out of the puzzle, which stood for \"dracaena\" (a plant found in Africa's tropical rainforests) and the letter \"E\" was next in line.\n\nWith these logical processes in mind, we can quickly figure out the solution by cross-checking with the options.\n\nInput", "answer": "A: shelf"}
{"text": "Reason: The pantry (B) makes more sense than the cupboard (D). The phrase \"can goods\" (canned goods) is widely used in North America to mean canned food items such as canned vegetables, and is thus very relevant here.\nWhile a \"shelf\" (E) is indeed a type of cupboard, it does not immediately conjure can goods in one's mind. It's also more likely for food to be stored in a pantry, as these types of rooms (usually found next to a kitchen) are often used to store canned goods.\n\nInput: It is believed that the Earth's interior is made up of four different sections.

There is also a way to play a card game.  There are two ways to play the card game.  There is a way to beat your opponent in the game.  A: to win a match B:  C: to lose in a hand D:  E: \nOutput: The word 'win', like many sport-related words in the English language, can act as both a noun and a verb (as in, the verb 'win' meaning to succeed in the game, such as checkmate).  However, it can also function purely as a noun:  'Who won?' or 'Is there anything we can do to win?'\n\n\nWe can use the 'who' to indicate that the sentence is asking about a person, rather than the act of winning.\nWe can make an educated guess at the correct answer choice using this method. \nWe can cross out the noun answers, and we know that 'win' and 'play' are both verbs, so we could put a question mark next to those answers too.\n\nThe left-hand column is the correct answers.\nHere, 'win' acts as a verb, meaning 'to win,' so C is out: 'to lose in a hand.'  We know it's only a verb because 'to win' on its own indicates an action verb. \n'To lose in a hand' implies that 'win' is a subject, rather than the verb of the sentence.  \nThen, E might be a verb describing 'to beat your opponent' in the card game.\nThe final answer to the question then becomes C: to win a hand.\n\nInput:Which of the following is not an example of a fruit?\nChoices:  A:  B:", "answer": "C: battlefield"}

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nAnalyzing the options yields insight into the question. For instance, \"keeping house\" (B) is not a logical option for the question's subject, considering the words \"active and \"make\".  This indicates that the subject is actively making money.\n\nOption \"paying debts\" (A) doesn't seem likely given the context, either. Unless he's trying to make money to pay off a debt, it's not a logical outcome of being active.\n\nAnother option eliminated is \"having money\" (C). This would describe a person who is passive rather than active.\n\nThe two remaining choices are:\n - Making money (D)\n - Making money(E)\n\nBy rule of elimination, it could only reasonably be\n the \"make money\" (D). \"Make money\" is the option that describes the outcome of being active, and that is the only option left in the question.

Choices: E: 15 D: 24 B: 10 A:16 C: 10\nOutput: Reasonings:\n\nIf we take one at a time from each container  the second from the first is also from the first as it is filled only two colors. So we have 2 different colors.\nNow third from first will have 3 different colors.\nFourth from first will have 4 different colors.\nFifth from first will have only 2 different colors. And this completes the six. It includes 2 from first and 1 from second.\nNow, the second from second will have all the 6 different colors.

In this instance, context is vital to deciphering the correct answer.\nBecause \"Texan\" means someone who is from, or resides in, the U.S. state Texas, the correct answer is D, as is only a person from Texas in this context, not anyone from there alone.\n\nIn some contexts, a person's home state can be referred to as their home country without causing confusion, but here, the fact that Texans call themselves \"Texans\" and New Jersey residents \"New Jerseyans\" means the context of this question is different. \"Texan\" only applies to people from Texas, therefore only \"Texan\" is the correct answer here.\n\nNote: Since the word \"Texan\" was added as a part of the answer choices, the phrase \"A person from\" is unnecessary for the question itself to make sense.

As sour dough bread does not need measuring, but fermentation.\n\nThe remaining option, \"wash\" (C), is a good fit for the question. It is a physical action, and is also relevant to both bread and sour dough, as both require cleanliness when baking.

The only learning aid that would be useful for \"copying\" concepts is a dictionary, which is why it's not a correct choice.\n\nThe second option, \"to be intelligent\", implies that the learner has the necessary intellectual resources to learn on their own and therefore doesn't need any additional help. \n\nThe third option \"to be improved performer\" suggests that the learner is already performing well in their chosen field or subject, but they would like to progress and improve their performance.

However, since the context does not restrict to a particular sports game, a range of possible outcomes are possible.  \n\nOption \"soccer game\" (E) would be accurate in theory, however \"soccer\" and \"baseball\" are not included in English-based dictionaries as valid choices.\nOption \"pharmacy\" (C) would not necessarily describe a baseball stadium, since there is no pharmacy included in the wording of the question.\nOption \"football stadium\" (B) would be accurate, since \"stadium\" is a building typically used to host sporting events and games. However, if this is the case, the child would not be pounding his \"mitt\", which is likely a baseball glove.\nOption \"baseball stadium\" (D) would work theoretically, however the laboratory answer (A) remains the only correct choice.  \n\nSo the final answer for this question is Baseball Stadium\n</details>\n\ninput: The computer was unable to process the data due to which? \nChoices: A: a network error B: poor programming C: insufficient RAM D: insufficient disk space \nOutput: Reasonng:\n\nComputers need to process information in order to operate, which makes the options \"a network error\" (A) and \"poor programming\" (B) impossible.\n\nThe options \"insufficient RAM\" (C) and \"insufficient disk space\" (D) aren't mutually exclusive.

{"text": "Reason: The context of the question suggests that \"spoiled child's play room\" (A) is the correct answer. The phrase \"playroom\" gives a general sense that the child's room is in their house, and not a public building or institution.\n\nIt cannot be \"building\" (D) because the wording \"spoiled child\" indicates that the room belongs to a single child. Meanwhile, any playroom could be built into a larger building, so this option would not make sense.\n\nSimilarly, it cannot be \"big house\" (B) because the context of the question states that the room is massive, meaning that it is larger than a house.\n\nOption \"nursery school\" (C) is incorrect due to a similar issue of scale: A nursery school is a public building or institution where children are enrolled in groups to receive educational services. Even if the room in question is that of a child's nursery school, it would unlikely be referred to as their playroom. \n\nThe answer is not \"pre-school\" (E) for the reasons mentioned above.\n\nThe answer is in this one, is E: playroom", "answer": "A: big house"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first thing of note about this question is that public space and supermarkets aren't good places for exploring space - the context tells us they're not suitable for that, so they should be immediately eliminated as choices.\n\nOption \"roadblock\" (B) means an obstacle or barrier that hinders progress - i.e. \"a roadblock\" prevents traveling or exploring on the road. Therefore, it cannot be the answer.\n\nLikewise, option \"space shuttle\" (C) isn't a good choice either - if people wanted to explore space, then using an actual physical space shuttle wouldn't make much sense, since the entire purpose of using a space shuttle is to travel to and from space.\n\nThat leaves us with 2 viable options: option \"hoverboard\" (D) and option \"supermarket\". The key phrase here is \"exploring outer space\". So the question is really asking \"what should people use to explore outer space\". \"Hoverboard\" (D) is a type of self-balancing vehicle that is meant to be used indoors, such in a supermarket where the ground isn't necessarily that smooth.\n\nIn contrast, option \"supermarket\" doesn't fit with the question.

{"text": "Reason:\nThe options not to be chosen are A, B, and C.\nThere is only one possible reason why this answer is right, and that reason is because the scenario has not been provided with any other reasons to shock.

This scenario does not provide any other options for his surprise other than shocked.\n\n\nIf there were any other options for his \"surprise,\" then this answer may not be right.\nIf the scenario has provided other reasons for his shock, then that would mean that his shock was not limited to one option, and he may have been surprised at why he was shocked.\nThen he would not have given himself enough reason to be shocked. But in this scenario, when he got shocked, he gave himself no reason at all.\nWhich means that he did not look for any other reasons, and he was shocked for all he knew.\n\nTherefore this answer is right because he had no reason to get shocked, he didn't look for any reasons that he was shocked.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe context of the question suggests that the person we're talking about is a criminal being chased by the police, not an innocent citizen. This can be gleaned from the word \"...after him\". This implies that the person has done something that the police perceive as illegal and a crime.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible options are those that relate to the police attempting to apprehend the person. In other words, the options that relate to consequences from criminal activity. Choices C and D fit that description - they refer to the person \"catching cold\" and being \"hunted\" by the police, respectively.\n\nBut, again, in the question, it would be the most plausible decision to choose an option that suggests that the criminal had done something to ward off such potential consequences. \"Catch a cold\" (C) is unlikely since the cold is not a deterrent to criminal behavior.\n\n\"Hunt for food\" (B) also is implausible, since, again, it isn't a factor that would deter the criminal from engaging in the illegal activity. The option \"prepare to go\" (E) is similar to catch cold, in that this would be the option a criminal would choose to avoid potential consequences. This option is an action rather than a state of being.\n\nTherefore the most plausible choice is \"prepare to go\" which means the person in the scenario will go into hiding to avoid being found by the police.\n\nInput:Which of the following words is spelled correctly?

This is a clear indicator that words that start with the letter \"f\" will give spelling hints to this puzzle.\n\nTo test this clue, we can eliminate three of the answers. The words \"fundstion\" and \"funstion\" would be obvious false answer choices since they obviously do not contain \"fu\u2026\", unless we are mistakenly typing the word as \"fu\u2026sion\". \"Funtion\" also has a funky spelling of \"fu\u2026\".\n\nTherefore, we are left with two options.

{"text": "Reasonning:\n\nThe key is to figure out what the purpose of playing games is. \"Wining\" (A) seems plausible. But if that were the purpose of games, then wouldn't it make more sense to say \"winning games\" for a person to play games? \n\nInstead, the more accurate answer is \"entertainment\" (B). \"Entertainment\" is the overarching reason why people play games. The person who chooses games as a way to relax and spend idle time could also play games without wining for the sake of entertainment. Likewise, a cheater playing games for pure entertainment would not win, but would still be playing for entertainment.\nAnother reason to reject \"wining\" (A) is that this implies that there is no joy to winning in a game. That would be counter to reality - we usually try to win at games to have a fun time.\n\nAs long as that is the case, the next two options seem impossible since the person playing games would always want to win.\n\"Happiness\" (C) may sound applicable at first glance, because players might be happy when they win a game. But that is often short-lived as quickly as they start playing another game, and they're back to enjoying games solely for entertainment.\n\"Cheating\" (D) is also an invalid option because there are many forms of entertainment other than games - for instance, a movie or even sports. We don't usually go to movies to win, or watch sports in order to cheat\n\nThe only option remaining is \"relaxation\" (E). This would make sense if the person was a novice and playing a new game as a way to relax. However, we can expect for the other options to be included as well, even if a person is playing a game for the sole reason of relaxation and entertainment. Also, games can be a way to make new friends as a way to relax, and playing with friends is also a way to entertain yourself. Therefore, \"relaxation\" (D) may not make the most sense for someone who is a fan of playing games.\n\nThe correct answer is \"relaxation\"\n\n### Instruction:What happens to people when play games?\n\nInput: How can we tell if a person needs to sleep?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nFirstly we can determine the most obvious choice: option A, because B is a place to find a bag.\n\nHowever, option B can be eliminated since it states \u201cpacking\u201d which refers to something else. Option B can also be eliminated because the question specifically asks where the shopping bag is and not what it\u2019s made of, making option C irrelevant.\n\nThe next best choice is option D because the question is geared towards finding a shopping bag at a retail store. Additionally, no specific place is listed beside the word \u201cmart\u201d so option D is the ideal candidate.\n\nAnother possible choice is option E because the question specifically asks about a retail store that sells bags. However, option E states \u201cpacking groceries\u201d which is once again irrelevant because the question asks for the location of the bag rather than its purpose.\n\nThis scenario follows the same logic and principles.\n\nSo the final answer for where you would find a shopping bag is E: hardware store.\n\nInput: When someone is depressed, they feel A: joyful B: happy C: joyous D: downhearted E: downheartedness\nOutput: Reason for Selection :\n\nThe last word of the first option is downhearted, which is a grammatical error. Downhearted is defined as depressed; however, downheartedness is not a word. Therefore, one can assume that the author intended to choose \u201cdownhearted\u201d (D), not \u201cdownheartedness\u201d (E) as the answer choice.\n\nThe second answer choice (B) refers to joyful, which is the antonym of the word \u201cdepressed\u201d in the question. \n\nThe first answer choice (A) states that someone with deep grief feels joyful \u2013 this cannot be true because the opposite of \u201cdeep grief\u201d is depression, not joyfulness.\n\nThe third answer choice (C) also uses the incorrect spelling of \u201cjoyous\u201d which cannot be corrected due to grammatical error.\n\nThe next answer choice would be the correct one because the author stated that depression includes feelings of downheartedness. The answer (D) reads \u201cdownfeeling,\u201d which suggests that the author was trying to spell \u201cdepression.\u201d This would explain why the spelling is off, and why there is no word called \u201c", "answer": "A: supermarket"}

{"text": "Reason:\nThe first thing we do is to eliminate the obvious option: **magazines (E)**. A bookstore is too large to contain only magazines.\n\nNext, we want to look at the plausibility of other options. **town (A) and city (D)** both sound appropriate - the options are not mutually exclusive. However, what distinguishes one from the other is **the types of stores you can find*. A town usually contains more specialized shops, while cities usually contain large bookstores and malls.\n\nIn the end, we find that **town (A)** is more plausible since it contains a variety of shops, making it easier to find a bookstore.", "answer": "C: city"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nAs mentioned previously, a key indicator of the correct choice is using logic and reasoning to narrow down the options. This question does just that: it eliminates options that don't make sense while keeping those that do.\n\nLet's take a look at each option in turn.\n\nOption \"examine thing\" (A) doesn't make sense in the context of viewing a show. This is because looking into a mirror wouldn't ensure viewing enjoyment; in fact, it would be considered rude and could damage the mirror. While this answer would work well in other contexts such as performing an inspection of machinery, it doesn't apply to watching a show.\n\nNext, we have \"go somewhere\" (B). While it's certainly possible to find enjoyment in going on a trip, ensuring you can view a show while you're away isn't guaranteed. There might not be Wi-Fi available, you might forget something crucial for viewing, or you might not want to miss out on some other activity in order to watch a show.\n\nSimilarly, the choice \"hear news\" (C) doesn't work, as people may have the ability to hear news from a variety of sources but may not necessarily be able to view specific shows only available to cable subscribers. Additionally, hearing news can't guarantee viewing enjoyment since some people might prefer not to be informed.\n\nNext we have \"see favorite show\" (D). While it is true that this would likely guarantee viewing enjoyment, the context of the question was related to viewing pleasure, not necessarily what you want to see. This could be considered an error in the wording of the question if you thought this was the correct answer based on the given context.\n\nFinally we come to \"see favorite show\" as the correct option (E). This provides viewing enjoyment and aligns with the context of the question as being related to \"viewing pleasure\".", "answer": "E: see favorite show"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe key information to understand here is that purchasing decisions generally involve some level of motivation. That eliminates options such as \"money\" (C) and \"time\" (E) from consideration.\n\nChoosing between \"needs\" (B) and Desire\" (A), however, is tougher. Both terms relate to motivation, but \"needs\" generally refers to things necessary for survival, such as food or shelter, while \"desire\" refers to something that's less necessary.\n\nTo settle on the right answer, it helps to consider the context of the question - which here, is purchasing products.\n\nMany products are not necessities for survival, which means that we can rule out \"needs\" (as it refers to necessities).\n\nThis means that \"desire\" could be the more appropriate answer.\nTherefore, the final choice is A: desire\n\nInput: What is your favourite genre?

For example, you can\u2019t find sports a favorite one because it means you like sports, it is not a preference.\n\nIn this question, options are genres of movies, so to find out you need to find out your own preference rather than liking.\n\nComing to the first question, \u2018sports\u2019 (1) will be a valid answer since you yourself prefer sports over the others.\n\nThe second one is again an option for \u2018crime\u2019, like mystery because of the similar traits.\n\nIt is always the preferences which will be there in the mind of the user, not the other way around.\n\nSimilarly, in other questions too it is our own preference that will be there in the user\u2019s mind.

It's also the only plausible answer that fits with the scientific context of the question (it wouldn't make sense for \"pet the dog\" to be an accurate answer if the question mentions \"reproduction\").

A: Theodore Roosevelt B: Nintendo Inc C: Steve Jobs D: Adam Jovic E: George Orwell\nOutput:Reason:\n\nThe first answer option \"The Atari Co.\" is incorrect as the Atari company did not release any portable game systems.\n\nThe term \"Nintendo Inc.\" is a reference to Nintendo, a Japanese gaming manufacturer that released the world's first truly portable game in 1993. \n\nSteve Jobs ( option C ) founded Apple Computer in 1976  and was not involved with the Nintendo Game Boy.\n\n\"Adam Jovic\" ( option D ) is a fictitious character in George Orwell's novel \"1984,\" which was published four years after the Nintendo Game Boy's release.

{"text": "Reason:\n  The number of rows in a supermarket can vary, but it's unlikely that they would all fill a garage. The word \"row\" also suggests that the choice answers are rows, which is only the case at warehouses. On the other hand, garages, supermarkets, or gardens are not likely to have hundreds of rows of anything. That eliminates D, C, and B, respectively, as the choices. Since the \"large container\" is in a grocery store, it's likely to be filled with something such as food.\n\nThe choice \"warehouse\" is the least specific, because an image of a warehouse may not immediately show you that it contains large rows of items\u2014it might look more like a factory. So \"warehouse\" is not a specific choice.\n\nThe option \"factory\" also makes logical sense because it involves manufacturing or production, which implies that rows or rows of products occur. Also, \"factory\" is the word that best matches the number of words in the problem (four letters). However, a row of products in a factory may not appear to be \"large\" as it would in a farm or warehouse.\n\nThe choice is between the last two, because \"supermarket\" doesn't work for the same reasons as \"factory.\" The question is not about what the store sells, but what it is or what's inside of it. Therefore, the correct choice is E: warehouse.\nIn this kind of problem, there is often a clue as to the number of options, such as A \"large container\", B \"one hundred rows of\"...\n\nIt seems that the clue to the problem above is that it starts with the words - A large container...\n\nInput: The large pizza was as big as a bullshit, they had a large table which could hold which size of what?

The term \"movie\" suggests a cinematic setting, where a movie theater is likely the most appropriate place to eat cake and ice cream.

{"text": "Reason\nThe instruction suggests a traveler who finds a fox in some state. As there can't be more states but a few, there's no ambiguity. Hence, it can be ruled out the options like \"mountains\" (E) and \"Louisiana\" (B).\nThe instruction also hints that one should consider the context and identify the state.\nIt suggests that the person should not have expected to find a fox. But the scenario does not support the option A (Alabama), where one would likely to find a fox, along with other states of the mountains.\nThe option B (Louisiana) is again disqualified because foxes do not roam there and the reason for writing the question suggests otherwise.\nThe option C (South Carolina) seems to be the only fitting choice, because the fox would not be found in the coastal, gulf states.\n\nAlso, the instruction states that one should consider the geography of the question.\nIt says one should identify the geographical area to answer the question correctly. So A, C and D (Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama) fail to match the instruction and hence cannot be selected. The correct answer is B (South Carolina)", "answer": "B: louisiana"}
{"text": "Reasoning: \n\nThis question can be answered best by analyzing each word in the sentence.  \"Yard,\" we see, is preceded by \"tinier\" which implies that \"yard\" must be smaller than an already small unit - in this case, a unit that is much smaller than a farm.  An area of land smaller than a yard definitely would be classified as a small or \"tiny\" unit of land.\n\nFinally. we can see that \"tinier\" must appear directly before \"yard\" because it is not at all plausible for the yard to be \"tinier\" before it is smaller than a farm.\nSo, the final answer to this question is option C, because a yard can be considered tiny if it is only slightly smaller than a neighborhood. While farmland or properties in their entirety might be classified as tiny, a yard definitely has at least some relevance to a neighborhood. Therefore, out of all the answers, only C best fits the given context.\n\n### TF-IDF\n\nIn this section, we will go over how to use the TF-IDF algorithm for finding the most common words in a text document. TF-IDF is an abbreviation for the term \"term frequency - inverse document frequency\". It is a statistical model that calculates the terms in the document that have the highest relevance in relation to the words in the text.\n\nWe begin with a simple example. Let us say we have a book with three sentences containing the phrase \"red car\". For instance:\n\n[The sun was yellow, the clouds were red. I drove a red car. I like my red car.]\n\nWhat is common among all three sentences? It is \"red car\"! Therefore, applying TF-IDF to the above text would reveal that \"red car\" is the most commonly occurring phrase since it appears three times in the document.\n\n### How we can use Term Frequency for TF-IDF \n\nLet us use 2 different approaches, and see how they apply for the same context. First, we are going to use frequency model alone. So, let us look at the following sentences:\n\n \t[What a wonderful day this is! It is a green car! It was a pink turtle and a yellow turtle. I need to take the red car out", "answer": "C: city"}

{"text": "Reasoning:\n \nThe purpose of the question is to determine if the speaker is referring specifically to a human or more generally to a non-human species.\n\nOption A is not a mouth, but a human lip: the speaker has chosen an incorrect answer.\n\nOption B is a can, but more generally we speak of a canned soda drink that is not alive.\n\nOption C could be either a human's mouth or KFC's signature chicken dish. To better understand the meaning behind the question, it's important to observe the speaker's context.\n\nAs we can see in the conversation below, she is talking about her friend, who has two children, one of which has a \"lip in the bathroom.\" Therefore, B is also incorrect because it describes a can.\n\nOptions D and E describe a mouth, so they cannot be the correct answer. We cannot be sure what the speaker means, but if he says \"a human being\" the most plausible conclusion is a human. But, we can't be certain that the speaker is referring to humans as \"living things.\"\n\nA canned drink or KFC is not a human being, but may nevertheless be considered a living organism.\n\nSo after considering all the facts, we cannot determine what the speaker is actually talking about. In the end, there is no definitive answer to this question, which is why the answer is D: snake\n\nInput:Is the sun going to explode?\n\nOutput:Reason:\n\n\nThe questions asks for a choice from E, but to understand the question you must have a working knowledge of the speaker.\n\nIt seems that the speaker does not know much about science, otherwise, it is unlikely that she would make a comment like \"the sun is going to explode\". This is not the type of language normally used when speaking about scientific information. It seems that the speaker is trying to make it seem like she knows more than she does.\n\nIf the speaker has a better understanding of science, then she would not make such a comment.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the question refers to a scientific event but instead is more of an observation about something in the speaker's personal life.", "answer": "C: human"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nThis is another tricky question, where analyzing the context and the options provides the key. \"They were celebrating the occasion\" implies a group of people who would be celebrating some kind of event.\n\nIf the event occurred just once, they would \"celebrate it.\" Because this particular event could be considered unique, it wouldn't be described as \"intimacy\" (B) or \"dancing\" (C). \n\nThe same logic applies to the last option, \"happiness\" (E). While everyone should be happy on an important occasion, the context of this question indicates that an event is being celebrated.\nTherefore, this wouldn't be a typical celebration, that is, \"drinking and dancing.\"\n\nThe final option, \"enjoyment,\" (D) indicates activities that are related to the event being celebrated, which makes it the more suitable answer to the question.  Hence, 7(D) is the most appropriate answer.\n\nInput:Which of the following would be the most likely reaction for students to getting poor grades? Choices:  B: anger\n\n\nOutput:Reason:\n\nAgain, this question is tricky to solve because there aren't any obvious answers that seem to match the scenario.\n\nThe first step is eliminating all incorrect answers. We eliminate \"anger\" (B) first, because being upset about a certain event doesn't mean that you're going to \"move forward\" and learn from your mistakes. \"Anger\" (B) seems plausible in context, but not in line with this particular question.\n\nNext, we try \"grow\" (A), but \"grow\" wouldn't be directly related to getting poor grades. Students would need to go through an analytical process to determine how to grow.\n\nThen, \"determine\" (C) is rejected because it's too broad in scope and doesn't necessarily imply growth or movement.\n\nFinally - the most plausible answer is \"learn from your mistakes\" (D). The scenario involves poor grade and a negative impact on future career. The students will probably try their best not to repeat the mistakes they made that resulted in low grades. They will try to learn from them and hopefully get good or better grades in the future.\nTherefore, the only correct answer", "answer": "D: happiness"}
{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nFirst, we can rule out options D and E. Because the word \"office\" implies that the supplies would be commercial in nature: this would include supersize packs of printer paper, but would not include art supplies.\n\nNow, of the remaining alternatives, we can rule out option A. The word \"for\" would probably refer to a type of material to buy, rather than a location.\n\nWe can then rule out option C, because \"large pieces\" would not be likely to fit in a regular suitcase.\n\nThis leaves us with the most likely answer, which is option B. We can assume that there are large pads of paper available in a computer printer, because printers often feed on large volumes of paper.\n\nThe final answer is B.\n\nInput:You have to do some grocery shopping. What is the best thing to take with the coupon? Choices: A: a cart B: a money clip C: a shopping list D: a tote bag E: a wagon\nOutput:Reason:\n\nFirst, ruling out the obvious \"A:a cart\" because a cart is most definitely not a good thing to carry around with a lot of groceries!\n\nNext consider \"C\", a shopping list - does it really get much better? You can check the coupon for what types of goods are on this shopping list, make a list of what you need from each of those types, take the grocery store checklist with you, and your shopping is sure to be done quickly!\n\n\"A.

{"text": "Reason: \n\nThe first task, as always, is to understand the literal meaning of the sentence, that is \"in motion\" (B). This option best reflects the meaning and purpose of the clause.\n\nNext, the purpose of this sentence is to describe a change of motion versus its opposite, \"rest\". Choice (E), \"rest\", is out since it describes a change to \"rest\", not a change of state.\n\nThe next task would be to find the appropriate synonym of \"in motion\" (out of the synonyms provided, which are \"active\" and \"wakeful\"). It turns out that \"active\" does not have any meaning as a verb (e.g. \"He ate some active\"). Therefore \"wakeful\" (C) is a suitable synonym.\n\nThe final analysis involves finding an appropriate antonym of \"in motion\" \u2014 it turns out that that is \"rest\". Therefore, \"in motion\" and \"rest\" are opposites, and they can be used to create a new logical statement:\n\u201cJames could sleep when the balls were at rest\u201d (meaning that he slept while the balls were not in motion)\n\nSo, the correct answer is C: restful (as an active antonym for the in-motion verb).\n\nInput:In order to determine the weight, the scientist used a scale to measure the force the objects exerted.

Instead, it provides more specific information needed in order to select the best answer.\n\nOption \"school\" (C) is not a good answer because that does not make sense or fit the given facts. Option \"building\" (D) is not a good option either, because it is not in the scenario where John needs to plug in his RV to cook.\n\nTherefore, the only good answer choice is option \"toy store\" (A). The toy store appears to be a good place in the scenario because it sells RV plugs. The toy store may not be where John expected to find RV plugs, but the scenario still provides enough information so that this answer can be considered.\nSo the correct answer is option A: toy store\n\nInput: The scientist wants to do the following:  A: investigate B: analyse his experiment C: learn more D: explore an alternative E: do math\nOutput: Reason:\n\nThis question involves scientific context and there are clear clues in the given answer choices that allow a person to determine whether a given answer is likely to be the best answer.\nIt is important to note that there is a difference between \"learn more\" and \"analyse.\" \n\nOption \"learn more\" (D) is a good answer choice, because that could be an important outcome of a research study.

However, there is nothing that provides a clear indication that this is the most likely outcomes of a research study, or that would cause the researcher to \"analyse.\"\n\n\"Explore an alternative\" (E) is also an option.

{"text": "Reason:The marinara in this scenario can be interpreted as referring to a particular dish. Thus, it would be unlikely for the saucepan to be used for boiling eggs (D) or storing in the cupboard  (C). It would be more likely kept for use in the kitchen, such as a restaurant, where marinara is a common dish (A). Or, since the saucepan could also be used to cook other dishes, the marinara could potentially be used for boiling or cooking eggs, such as for an egg and pasta dish.

Since \"driving\" (D) is not feasible, we can eliminate that answer. The other five answers are then evaluated by how \"fast\" they would be. The answer of \"walk\" (E) seems the slowest, while \"teleport\" (B) seems the fastest. A rocket is also a vehicle that can travel faster than an average person could walk.

{"text": "Reasoning;\nThe main point here is to understand the \"feeling\" the person has toward the someone else, which would be the most important detail to pinpoint in this situation. The options that are irrelevant are \"negligence\" (C) and \"antipathy\" (D), because \"negative\" feelings such as these are not likely to describe what the character in question does not care about.\nThe other irrelevant option is \"rational\" (B), which doesn't fit the context of the question as something that can be related to someone who wishes someone else to fail.\n\nThe last two options are both valid. The first one is, of course, \"indifferent\" (E), which is quite straightforward. \n\nThe final option is \"rapport\" (A), which is a bit surprising at first sight, but makes a lot of sense when one considers the definition of \"rapport.\" According to Webster's Dictionary, rapport is \"the established relationship between persons: mutual communication: mutual understanding.\" Hence, the term is not only applicable to positive relationships, but can also be used to describe a relationship between two individuals in which one simply does not care about the other. If the character in question does indeed not care about the other person, he or she is likely to see the relationship between them as having no special significance and simply an established exchange of dialogue. Therefore, this would also be the most accurate answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is E and A: indifferent and rapport. \n\n\nInput: Someone who wishes you the best wishes you well.\nOutput:Reason:\n\nHere, \"wishes you the best\" and \"wishes you well\" have the same meaning and can be considered \"equivalents.\" Hence, while either can be used to describe the wish of something good, they do not serve opposite purposes because they have the same overall goal.", "answer": "C: antipathy"}

What does the term \"giving the AI a secullar upbringing\" mean?\n\nThis implies that James is creating an AI and deciding whether it will be raised in a secular or religious upbringing. This is relevant because it provides insight into James' desires and expectations, which can help determine the answer to this question.\n\nThe next task involves determining whether the outcome of such an upbringing would lead to eternal, religious, unpredictable, holy, or monastic results.\n\"Eternal\" (A) and \"religious\" (B) are vague and may not be what James hopes for, though they are perhaps more likely than the next three options.\n\"Unpredictable\" (C) has an element of truth to it, especially if James is seeking some novel or unusual outcome, but it doesn't seem like a guarantee.\n\"Holy\" (D) could be a reference to a higher-than-human intelligence or a deity, but \"monastic\" (E) is a bit of a stretch for me.\nSo the final analysis leads to the choice between eternal and unpredictable. Ultimately, though, James has created an AI, so neither is \"eternal\" (A) or \"unpredictable\" (C).\nThe most likely outcome of James' actions is that the AI will be secular, and the question should be rephrased to reflect this.\nHere, the best answer is: Unpredictable", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}

The reader wants to know what's stopping him.\nOptions A-D are easily ruled out, as they don't include the word \"strained\" or \"impeding\". The reason is that they describe elements that do not impede movement, such as seaweed (B) and mud, sand, and other debris (D).\n\nSo the final answer would be C: tidepool\n\n### Instruction:Answer the truefalse question.\n\nInput1:The students in this classroom all came back with good grades.

{"text": "Choice C is clearly the correct answer. The question mentions cargo ships, which carry large containers that can be filled with food and other items.\n\nOutput:\n\nReasoning:\n\nIt can reasonably be inferred from this context that cargo ships contain containers, which can be loaded with various materials. Thus, the correct answer is Choice C: refrigerators.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question.\n\nInput:\"The new book was an instant hit. It sold out in just 2 days.\" Choices:  A) sold out in 2 days B) sold in 2 days C) was out in 2 days D) had become sold in 2 days E) was sold 2 days\nOutput: A is the best answer.\n\nOutput: Reason:\n\nChoice A is the correct answer because it accurately describes the situation with the highest degree of precision. The original statement \"The new book was an immediate success. It was out in 2 times\" implies that the book was out of stock (out-of-stock). In other words, \"instant \" indicates the phrase \"immediate\" in the original sentence is the correct response. Since the author did not give any new information about the book's status, the only plausible response to the question \"What happened to the book?\" must be \"The book was out on sale in 2 days.\" This makes choice A the most likely response. It is important to remember that just because a sentence begins with the phrase \"The new book\" does not mean that the original statement (the entire original sentence) was not accurate. In this context, it may be that some new information about the book was given after the original sentence was written, but Choice A is still the best choice in question 1.\n\n### Multiple Choice:\n\nThe only right option is C. \n\nExplanation:\n\nThis is because there are only 30 seconds left, and you already have plenty of time to answer the question. You cannot waste time and end up not being able to do the calculation at all.\n\n### Input:\n\nWhich of the following has five times the number of 4-digit numbers that have the same 4-digit number in the first place?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe scenario invokes the idea of playing cards at the casino, suggesting that a specific action is prohibited. This narrows down the options considerably. \n\nOption \"remember\" (A) is implausible because the casino has a house advantage, so it would be in its interest to prevent players from learning more about the odds and potentially exploiting that knowledge.\nLikewise, \"helping\" (B) makes zero sense since the casino would want to prevent players interacting with each other and thereby circumventing any rules.\n\"Counting\" (C) is also improbable. It doesn't make sense that the casino wouldn't want players to be able to count cards, because that would allow them to gain a strategic advantage. \n\nHowever, \"winning\" (D) and \"dealing\" (E) do seem like things you are not allowed to do at a casino. Both options depict behaviors prohibited due to the house advantage. That makes sense given the description, and option (E) is probably more commonly expected than option (D). So the final answer is E\n\nInput:What's an easy way to make a million dollars? Choices:  All of the options: A: be a millionaire B: be rich C: work hard D: earn a lot E: win the lottery\nOutput:Reason:\n\nThe first thing to consider is how to make that money. In the options, \"be a millionaire\" (A) suggests that you already have millions of dollars, and, thus, not in the running for this question. \"Being rich\" (B) also has the same connotation.\n\n\"Work hard\" (C) sounds farfetched. It's unlikely that you'd get a job as an office worker and earn $1 million in five years without cheating the employer out of a lot of money. Similarly, \"earn a lot\" (D) conveys similar issues regarding the timeframe and the feasibility of such an end-goal.\n\n\"Win the lottery\" (E) sounds like the only way to get rich quickly, but it's highly unlikely given how random lotteries are. The chance of a single player winning the jackpot is 2 in ten million. Changes to the lottery do not have an influence on", "answer": "C: count"}
{"text": "Reason:\nThe answer to this question is \"judging,\" which makes sense given the context of the question and the wording of the description. \"Responsibility\" doesn't make sense, because a judge must be responsible for their decisions, but a judge does not \"judge\" a pig. Moreover, the wording of the question implies that a \"judgment\" has already been arrived at and only requires a determination (as in option B).\n\n\"Prejudice\" isn't an option, as judges are meant to remove personal bias when determining the best pig (see the question for the context). \"Verdict\" doesn't fit either, as it isn't describing a judge making a judgment but rather announcing a verdict.\n\nThe most logical answer to this question is judging.\nSo the final option is \"Judging\"\n\nInput: The teacher will present the class with a what? Choices: The best one is: A: math problem B: science hypothesis C: english poem D: history report E: history document\nOutput: The correct answer is: D\n\nThis question could be a trap for somebody who is too hasty and doesn't read the question carefully. The answer isn't as obvious as it appears. Option D ('document') fits the context, as it's a writing assignment instead of a math problem or a science experiment. And when you think about it, D is the only answer which actually describes what happens in a classroom.\n\nIt's easy to overlook this because the previous question contained an incorrect answer, making the user more likely to trust the answer in that question.

Choices:  I: pay cash in full with no interest and no late payment  II: pay cash in small installment III: take out cash advance  IV: apply for loan from the bank  V: default on payment\nOutput:(d)\n\nIf a customer took out cash advance, that would certainly lower their credit score. Other than that, it's difficult to say which choice would result in a lower credit score. Only cash advance (I) or default on payment (V) would have a significant and lasting impact on their credit score.\n\nSince the remaining choices aren't definitively stated to have a negative impact on credit score, we can exclude cash in small installments (III), pay cash in full, without interest, no late payment (II), and apply for loan from the lender (IV).\nThese choices are not clearly stated to be beneficial in terms of credit score. They may be more advantageous in other ways, but a poor credit score is never a result.\n\nThus, the answer would be \"d\".\n\nInput: The girl used the chopsticks to eat her dinner. The reason she had used it was because she felt very lonely. She used the chopstick to hold what?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nAn important detail here is that we're dealing with a scenario where all the seats in the vehicle are filled. With no available spots for a shopping bag, storing it in the trunk (C) isn't an option. But what if we look at the overall context and purpose?\n\nThe context is the shopping trip - we're trying to find a place to store the shopping bag. From this perspective, we cannot consider options such as \"storage cabinet\" (B) and even \"retail store\" (E). Since our goal is to find a way to stow the bag, we have to exclude those two options.\n\nSo the second task is to identify what exactly we can and cannot do - given the context of the question and our previous information. The options that do meet those requirements are: A roof, car trunk, and home. While the options of car trunk (C) and home (E) seem very similar, this is not a multiple choice question. Therefore, to narrow the options down further, we can consider what each question asks:\nWhat would you do with all the seats in your car being full?\n\nThe option C suggests stowing the shopping bag somewhere in your car, but the phrase \"all the seats in your car\" would contradict such a behavior. The option E suggests storing the bag in your home, which would also contradict the purpose of the question. But what does the option A ask? According to the information provided so far, the only correct answer is roof (A).

That eliminates options \"B\" (Communication) and \"C\" (Understood). The question then asks us to pick one of the feelings that best describe the emotional process that followed the expression. \n\nOption \"A\" (Self Pity) is thus the best choice, because it is a common emotion when someone has sustained physical damage. However, option \"D\" (Pain) would be a correct answer, too, since the bruise would presumably also be painful (in some cases, bruises are even extremely painful). \n\nOption \"E\" (Embarrassment) is not a suitable choice, because it could not have applied in this instance  - since someone experiencing a bruise would be unable to express embarrassment because it would be irrelevant.\nTherefore, the final answer to this question is A: Self pity.", "answer": "D: pain"}

Is the sentence false or true? Choices: A: False B: True C: It was confusing for me D: No explanation E: That's what time is about\nOutput: Reason This question is about the sentence: \"The first time I heard someone talking about time as money, I was confused on what the point was of using money for something that we don't physcially own.\" This question relates to whether or not the sentence is true or false. It's important to look at the context of the sentence to answer this question. Here, we can see that the sentence talks about someone getting confused about the point in using money for something we own. This, however, is false. As the question says, we don't physicially own time. We do, however, have control over our time. This means that we can use money to buy back time. This is similar to making an investment to gain money. We then invest that money with the hopes of getting more money. Just like an investment, time is something that can be purchased. It's important not to confuse control over something with owning something.

It's best to avoid option A and B (and maybe even C) for being too vague and inaccurate.\n\nIt's much more reasonable that whatever one owns would be used and interacted with daily, making it an inevitable part of interactions with spiders. After all, this isn't the home we're talking about, it's the land surrounding the home. By avoiding the shed, perhaps the person in question is afraid that spiders will crawl inside. \n\nFinally, option D, the mail box, seems to be an outlier. In most cases, the mailbox is outside and is unlikely to be a home to spiders, so it would make little sense to avoid it.\n\nThe final answer is D: mail box\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question using multiple choice answer format.

But it wouldn't be common practice to call a nighttime sky a \"star orbit\". Therefore, it doesn't make sense within the sentence.\n\nThe last option, \"the ground\", is most accurate.

{"text": "Reason: \n\nThe key to discerning the correct answer choice here is to understand context. The description of \"many cubicles\" indicates a workplace setting, and the task is to \"teach\" (A) or \"do work\" (D).\n\nOption A doesn't make sense because computers are often used to teach. The task doesn't suggest employees are teaching each other, which makes option A less likely.\n\nOption D is not true because computers don't need to be taught in order to do work. Computers are designed to do specific tasks, which eliminates option D from the list.  \n\nOption B needs to be disregarded because computers are used for many purposes besides \"teaching\". For example, computers are also used to browse the internet, create spreadsheets, or even play video games. But the task of \"helping people\" is exclusive to the use of computers, which confirms option B as incorrect. \n\nThe correct choice is E: help people, because the task indicates that the goal of the computers is to help people. It's common to use computers for things like online classes, productivity tools, entertainment, and communication. It doesn't make sense to use computers for \"doing work\" or \"teaching\" when the task is to \"help people\".\n### Instruction:Answer the\n\n![](../../../images/58.jpg)\n\n### Instruction\n\nThe input and output choices are\n\nOutput:\nC: 10:00\nD: 10:25\nE: 10:40\nOutput:\nInput: The man walked out on his boat.\nOutput: The man has never been on a boat before.\n\n### Solution:Answer", "answer": "C: do work"}

No B. yes C. I don't know\nOutput:Explanatin: the answer is A:No.\n\nThe sentence \"The man with the big feet\" could be construed to either refer to someone who has big feet or someone who is very old. We can be certain that the man has big feet by referencing to the second condition \"a girl asked him if she wanted to walk...\" We can also be certain that this is not a situation where the person with the big feet is trying to pick up a girl, because \"A girl asked if she wanted to walk with him.\" so this can't be a pick-up situation.\"The man with big feet\" refers to someone who is older and may not be considered attractive enough to be a potential partner by the girl.

Since they enter the body by touching or eating food they can be stopped by keeping the body's surface clean. That's why your body can resist and fight the infection and the disease.

In other words, he's thinking about what to wear. From these possible answers, \"study the data more carefully\" (C) and \"change his clothes\" (A) don't fit the context of the questions.\n\nOption B, \"eat a snack\" (G), seems like a possibility, but an outdated one.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe correct answer here is choice E: 'fish school'.\n\nTo gain clarity about how \"fish school\" fits the question, we begin by discarding the other choice and identifying why they cannot be the correct answer.\n\nFirst, we notice that the 'fish don't sit' part of the question excludes choice A, \"pets.\" Fish do not sit to complete an inward-turned task such as petting. They swim in an outward fashion.\n\nSecondly, choice C, \"attempt to fly,\" is discarded because they cannot attempt to fly - a task that would require them to be in the air, as opposed to schooling.\n\nThe next section involves further narrowing down our remaining choice, \"school together.\"\n\nFish schools together to breathe air.\n\nThe reason choice E, \"fish school\" answers the question is because fish school to help breath air. \n\nWith this, the remaining choice, \"schooling together\" is the correct answer to this question.", "answer": "D: school together"}
{"text": "Reason: This question is not clear, but there are a lot of hints to help you decipher the answer. First, you consider the context of the prompt, which mentions an aircraft carrier and war as potential locations where you might find airplanes. You conclude that the airplanes wouldn't be used in either of those settings - either if they're on an aircraft carrier, they would be flying, which doesn't necessarily indicate \"not in use,\" or if they're being used in a war, they wouldn't be flying. \n\nNext, you consider the meaning of \"airplanes that are not used,\" which is what this question is asking you to find. While the prompt doesn't explicitly state what \"not used\" means, looking at the broader context and what you've already discussed, it's clear that this question is asking you about non-flying airplanes. \n\nFinally, you think about what types of airplanes you might find around the airport. You consider an airport's maintenance and storage buildings, which are where airplanes are typically kept and repaired. You conclude that you could find airplanes stored or being repaired in these locations. \n\nSo the answer is C: sky\n\nInput:A person is always in front of you. Choices:  A.

{"text": "Reason: \n\nThe question asks the reader, \"Where does a beaver do [leave]?\" based on the title of the passage,\"The Beaver Saga\". In other words, it's asking where the beaver goes after the events of the story.\n\nOption \"wooded area\" (B), is an interesting selection as it refers to the \"forest area\" where the beaver lives initially. It is certainly a place the beaver does leave after fleeing the cabin in the opening scene.\n\nHowever \"the ocean\" (D) doesn't make much sense since the beaver never left the lake area (according to the passage) and \"zoo\" (E), even though the beaver does eventually end up at the zoo, would be a less obvious choice for the next location.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore B: \"wooded area\".\n\ninput: What would be an appropriate response to the question, \"I don't know any more than that\"?

Is that what you wanted to discuss L.Maybe it\u2019s time to start learning more about that subject M.Maybe next time\nOutput:Reasoning:\n\nSo, if the book is not the topic of the discussion, the only two phrases that make sense would be \"I'm sure that wasn't the answer you expected\" (K)\" and \"I'm sure the rest of the world's trying to do that\" (J), right?\n\nHowever, \"I'm sure you came in to discuss that\" (L) would be slightly more common in the scenario so L is the answer, and we'll have to consider J and K.\n\nOption \"I hope you enjoy the boo...

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nFirst, understand the context. It is stated that the speaker of the question is \"experiencing\" boredom.\n\nSecond, understand the options. The options are limited to a number of actions that the speaker is describing he does.\n\nFrom this, we understand that the option \"surf net\" (E) cannot be correct, because the questioner is referring to actions that he/she takes based on the feeling of boredom, which suggests that net surfing has been the case. So the options are A-C, which involves entertaining activities such as movies, cards, and chess - all of which are physical actions, as opposed to internet surfing, which is a sedentary activity.\n\nFinally the correct answer is option B: watch films. As such, movies is the only physical action among the options that is involved in the act of watching television, hence it is the most appropriate answer.", "answer": "A: watch film"}
{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nNotice that all answers except the one that begins with \"can\" are not possible as a logical continuation of the sentence. \n\nStarting with the sentence's end, \"learn from each other\" (C) is logically impossible.  Although humans do learn from one another in real life, it would not be possible to learn simply by listening to others; there must be some kind of interaction before learning can occur.  Therefore, this answer can be eliminated.\n\nNext, focus on the middle option: \"can pay bills.\" The first half of the sentence implies that people can understand each other better through listening.   However, paying bills cannot directly result from mutual understanding - not only would a large number of transactions be required for that purpose, but this kind of payment is also unlikely ever to happen out of mutual respect rather than a contractual agreement.  Therefore, this can be eliminated, leaving two options for the end of the sentence: \"believe in god\" (D), and \"talk to each other\" (E).\n\nOption (D), \"believe in god,\" is not a plausible end to the sentence. People may believe in god, or they may listen and understand each other, but they would not actually \"do\" this action simultaneously.  Further, although it is true that religious beliefs can be born out of mutual respect and discussion, the discussion would never result in \"believing in god,\" even if there is mutual understanding, simply because it would not be the same thing.\n\nFinally \"can talk to each other\" (D). The sentence could continue, \"If they can understand each other, then they can talk to each other and can do what?\"  The sentence does not indicate that more than one action is required.  Therefore the final answer is E.\nOutput: Input: There is nothing more beautiful than freedom. If you are free, you can do what? Choice: A) make choices B) talk to people C) create problems D) help others E) think of god\n\nOutput:\n\nNotice several facts about the sentence:\n\n* It does not begin \"If people can understand each other, they  can\" \n* The sentence as a whole states that freedom is beautiful and that people who are free can go on to do anything. So the \"you\" being talked about is free, and it", "answer": "C: learn from each other"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe question makes clear references to feeling and emotions. Therefore a good answer will also connect how an attitude of forgiveness relates to these emotions and how they are experienced, for instance to feel better (E).\n\nOption \"A: redemption\" (A) could be correct if the person asking forgiveness were being transformed by their sins. However, the attitude of the person giving the forgiveness and whether the person asking forgiveness is truly repentant are not addressed.\n\nOption \"B: isolation\" (B) is incorrect because the question does not make it clear whether the person asking for forgiveness is asking to be isolated - therefore this option is incorrect because it relates to an experience that the person is asking to be forgiven for.\n\nOption \"C: absolution\" (C) is incorrect because it is an incorrect term to use to describe forgiveness. Absolution refers to being absolved of a past sin.\n\nOption \"D: great relief\" (D) is incorrect because the person isn't necessarily feeling great - they might in fact be feeling regret or shame.\n\n\"E: feels better\" (E) is a grammatically inaccurate way to phrase this answer, as the question is not specifically asking about the feelings of the person who is being forgiven, rather than the one who is forgiving.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option E: feels better\n\nInput:The company is thinking of changing the way it designs its product, how do they plan to do so?

{"text": "Reason:\nOptions C, D, E are all clearly not accurate. A: farms and towns are not inexpensive and don't offer \"few\" luxuries. City: cities always offer luxuries, but that doesn't mean they're expensive and have \"few\" luxeuries. Hotels and motels are definitely \"luxuries,\" but they're not inexpensive. (Hotels cost more per night than motels.) \n\nIn the beginning of the paragraph, it describes that John had a limited budget, with no mention that he had more money to spend than that. It also says that he couldn't find a \"place to stay,\" which isn't true for a farm or a city. If he couldn't find anywhere to stay, it wouldn't say that, as there's nowhere else to go.\n\nIt states that he picked somewhere \"inexpensive\" and offered \"few luxuries.\" Hotels and motels do have more luxuries than a regular place. The average person doesn't have a million dollars to spend at a hotel each night, which is why many choose motels.\n\nThis means that the answer is E: motel.\n\nInput:Which of the following does the dog not need to eat?

{"text": "Reasoning: \n\nThe key to this question is understanding the context of the word \"they\". If the word \"they\" is referring to stock sellers, then options B, C, and D are correct because a hallway, table, and exchange are commonly used to refer to these spaces in the trading environment.\n\nIf the word \"they\" refers to traders, then either \"building\" (A) or \"office\" (E) is the correct answer. This is because the traders typically work in a building or an office space when they are not conducting their trades on the floor of the exchange.\n\nAssuming the word \"they\" does not refer to the stock sellers, and instead refers to the stock traders themselves, then the best response choices remain \"house\" (A) and \"office\" (E).\nThe word \"they\" is a grammatically incorrect choice and is not a response. Therefore, this question can be eliminated.\n\nFinally and with the context above, the last response choices of \"building\" (A), \"hallway\" (I), and \"table\" (C) are each incorrect. \n\nSo the final answer would be the only remaining answer choice, the \"office\" (E), which fits the appropriate context of the word \"building\" being used to describe both \"they\" as stock traders and \"they\" as salesmen.", "answer": "D: exchange"}

{"text": "Reason:The first task is to look for clues as to what an \"armchair\" is, i.e., what specifically is being referred to. The context points to a hospital, so it would be implausible to find an \"armchair.\" But since a \"study\" can be used as an intimidating term for a hospital ward, this option could also be accepted as plausible. The idea of a private study is not very credible, however, which removes this option from consideration. The last option, \"apartment,\" also seems to be a strange choice, since there would be very few apartments in a hospital.\n\nThe next task, then, is to try and determine where the furniture associated with an \"armchair,\" would be found. Again, the context is pointing in the direction of a hospital. The \"furniture store\" provides further insight into the idea that the furniture would be used by only a few users and is therefore an implausible option since it would have many customers. \n\nSimilarly, \"doctor's office\" is another implausible option, since there would also be many customers seeking medical attention at the doctor's office.

However, this fits the context of completing assignments and projects rather than listening to lectures, and is therefore irrelevant to the question.\n\nFinally we evaluate each option again, and can discount \"complete test\" (E) as it's not related to listening to the lecture. This leaves us with only two options: listening carefully (B) and listening to the lecture (D).\n\nIn this situation, it is essential for the student to fully understand the material that is presented in the lecture.

The spelling of Tape cannot be tapeo or tapeo D (or any other variation), because it is simply Tape.\n\nThe options for this question can be narrowed down further by identifying that the spelling rule is not backwards, but forwards. The spelling of TAPEO D, \"Tapes\" with all the E's spelt backwards, and \"Tape\" with the A's spelt backwards are invalid for this question.\n\nThe remaining options are incorrect because they do not reference the spelling rule. Option \"tapeo\" does not say what spelling rule would apply to this word; it merely lists what tape looks like spelt backwards. And option \"Tapeo\" simply refers to the singular form of tape.\n\nWe're left with one option, \"Tape\" (without an A).

Here, the context of the question is to buy some sauces; therefore, it wouldn't be too strange to buy them there. And it is reasonable to assume that they serve some type of food there that may have barbecue sauces offered for sale.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is E: Cafe\n\nInput:If I wanted to look for a dog for the winter, where would I get one?

Websites sell products online, and have nothing to do with physically buying dogs.\n\nAs for options \"pet store\" (B) and petstore (C), these are not reasonable because the question specifically states that there is only one place that offers dogs for sale, and this location would be the pet store.\n\nThat leaves us with option \"pet store\" (D) as the most likely answer to the question.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nOption (C) is eliminated because the question is referring to swimming pools which normally would not be shallow water (if it were shallow water it would not be a swimming pool). Therefore, this rules out ponds and children's pools.\n\nOption (A) lakes are generally larger than standard swimming pools. When the question refers to shallow waters they are generally referring to places like rivers. Therefore this option is immediately eliminated.\n\nOption (D) ponds have the potential to be shallow water and shallow water can be classified as a portion of bodies of water. Therefore, these two options are eliminated. Because option (B) states that it is a swimming pool and ponds may not be considered large swimming pools in some cases, this leaves as the best possible answer.", "answer": "D: pond"}
{"text": "Reasonings:\n\nThe first step is to determine exactly what context this question is asking for. In the previous question, the option \"A: a large building\" (C) would be perfectly valid. However, there's an important key to find when looking at the question: \"buried\" in the first sentence immediately eliminates \"A: a large public building\" and \"D: arena\".\n\nWe can now move on to deciphering and understanding the purpose of the explorers' actions.\n\"buried\" suggests treasure, but not necessarily \"a large public building\" or \"arena\". The second relevant word to consider is \"straight\". This is a significant piece of insight regarding the context: since the answers are to be chosen from \"A: public building\", \"B: tomb\", \"C: arena\", \"D: large building\", and \"E: treasure\", a large public building or even an arena might be considered valid. But the word \"straight\" immediately eliminates answers which are not \"large public buildings\" or \"arenas\", therefore limiting the pool to \"B: tomb\", and \"C: arena\" choices.\n\nSince \"A: public building\" (as shown from the previously eliminated choices) is obviously not a legitimate answer, that leaves us with three choices, one of which is \"E: treasure\". That makes \"D: large building\" (the only remaining answer with \"straight\") the correct answer, since it is \"the ancient buried tombs\" (A).\n\nSo the final answer to the question is D: large building", "answer": "B: tomb"}

This option seems like an inappropriate choice.\n\nOption \"home depot\" (D) seems like a possible candidate. \"Home\" is part of the character's quest, but so is \"floor\". However, \"where\" in the question also suggests that the character is in search of a place to buy. Therefore, this option seems like to be a likely fit.\n\nFinally option \"kitchen\" (E) seems too specific. \"Where\" in the question provides more context than that kitchen, for instance.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe question focuses on a specific event: the person cooking a pizza in the oven. As such, the options should all relate to the activity of cooking the pizza. \n\nOption \"look angry\" (D) doesn't belong, because it doesn't mention any activity related to the cooking process. This option should be eliminated.\n\nOption \"burnt\" (C) and \"bank savings\" (E) do not fit the context of the question, so both should be disregarded.\n\nNow, let's consider option \"catch cold\" (B). It suggests an adverse outcome in relation to the process of cooking. This seems plausible, especially since the question mentions a \"pizza\" as a specific object that was cooked. However, other objects might have also been in the oven, such as fruits, pastries, or even people. Therefore, this option should be disregarded as well.\n\nFinally option \"smells smoke\" (A) remains. While not exactly a common description of cooking food, a possibility exists that smoke was detected, and the outcome was a fire.

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nTo answer this question, we first need to understand the scenario: The clouds are described as being \"above\" the speaker, hinting that there is already an observer present who noticed the clouds. \n\nOption \"plain\" (A) doesn't make sense, since clouds are clearly an eye-catching phenomenon that would be sure to grab attention.\nAs for option \"dull\" (C), that can't be possible, as clouds are generally recognized as being bright and eye-catching.\n\nThat leaves us with the other options: \"bad\" (D) and \"wet\" (E). These are both plausible possibilities, as they would both potentially affect the observer who's viewing the clouds.\n\nThe choice of \"wet\" (option E) seems more plausible than \"bad\" (option D) because most people would interpret precipitation (ie: rain, snow) as being bad rather than wet, and \"bad\" itself isn't specific enough. The option \"bad\" could mean anything.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the most accurate answer is option E: wet\n\nInput: What is the most common thing that you hear people say when you are in a classroom? Choices:  D: Teacher A: Students C: Chairs B: Door\nOutput:ReasonING:\n\n\nTo answer this, we first have to understand what the context of the question is- specifically, what kind of classroom we're in. From the context, we understand that we're probably in a school or university, and we're probably talking about a lecture/classroom. So we can rule out \"Chairs\" (option B).\n\nSince the teacher is not present, we can then eliminate \"Teacher\" (option D) and \"Door\" (option A).\n\nWhile \"Students\" (option C) is a common activity in a classroom, its not the most common thing a student might hear in class. Instead, the most common thing you might hear is the teacher being asked a question by a student, or the student responding to something the teacher said.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is \"Students\"\n\nInput: Why did the man go to his friend\u2019s party without telling him?

{"text": "Reason: \n\nThe first thing to do is to identify the prepositional phrase containing the target word. The underlined words \"choker\" and \"boutique\" both contain prepositional phrases.\n\nThe second step is to deduce which modifier \"which\" or \"who\" is referring to by reading the sentence as a whole.\n\nIt's clear that the scientist is looking for a \"choker not located in a boutique\" in the first sentence, so we can immediately eliminate options B and E, which are referring to different locations of the choker. \n\nNext, we need to determine whether the target word \"located\" is an adverb or a preposition. To understand whether a word is an adverb or preposition, we look at the subject of the sentence to determine if it is in the same phrase.\n\nIn this case, it is clear from subject 'jewelry box' that \"located\" is an example of a preposition. (Prepositions are formed between the subject and the predicate, while adverbs are not.)\n\nThe question then becomes, \"where would you go to find the choker?\"\n\nIt makes the most sense if the answer option \"jewelry store\" is chosen. This is because a jewelry store is the location of a \"jewelry boutique.\" This is supported by the context of the question: \"You are looking for a choker not located [in a jewelry boutique].\"\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that the correct answer choice is \"jewelry shop\".\n\nInput: \"Learning is a lifelong endeavor. \" Choices:  A) Learning is ________________.

Only the choices that explain why the cowboy was angry would fit the question. It is unlikely that he rode the horse home since he only rode the horse to get from one place to another. The only way that he was an old Indian was that he was angry.\n\n\nInput:Which country is the world's #1 consumer of bananas?

Thus: of all the rooms in a yard, it is my favorite.\n\nWith that narrowed down, the next step is to try to answer the question. First, based on the context, it is clear that the yard is a house yard. The yard is also my favorite because the only other option that is relevant is \u201cyard\u201d, and it is clear what the option is being compared to.

Therefore, the option that fits the context of the question is (C).\n\nFinally, it gets a little tricker to answer the third question: whether the person is deadly.

We ask ourselves, of the answers for each question, does any answer satisfy the requirement and if not, we ask what type of answer is more likely to satisfy the requirement. \n\nFor example, for the first question, are we looking for a green drink or a drink that contains 2 cups of sugar?\n\nThe answer is, well obviously, a drink that contains 1 cup of sugar as green drinks do not contain sugar.\nAnd we can", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

But since the fox is seeking water, it can't simply be in a state of drought.\n\nIf the fox is searching for water in a state of drudgery, the only state that fits that description is Virginia (D).\n\nAnd if the fox is somewhere else during the drought, the obvious answer is E (movie hall).

If the scientist had instead asked the question, \"If someone is a ghosts, does that mean they dead?\" then the answer would be", "answer": "C: california"}
{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nIn the scenario, a sudden evacuation required people to be evacuated. This choice comes on the TV:\n\nThe first key is to pin down exactly what the scenario is describing - that is, a television show that was being interrupted to deliver an emergency alert. This is established by choice \"mandatory\" (B), which highlights the fact that the alert was required.\n\nThe next key is to determine if there is a more specific, related option that can be ruled out, even as the more general category becomes plausible. In order to do this effectively, it's crucial to understand the general purpose of an option with its related category. Does the category more generally relate to the subject, or does the specific option simply have more general significance? In this case, \"advisory\" (A), \"soap opera\" (C), and \"elective\" (D) can be ruled out because they do not relate to the nature of the TV show that's interrupted with information. Option \"mandatory\" is more specific with its plausibility, so the correct answer is \"optional\" (E), which implies a lesser degree of mandatorial requirement than its related category.\n\nInput:What is the most important quality of a successful lawyer? Choices: 1) A: Integrity 2) B: Earnestness 3) C: Attitude 4) D: Sense of humor 5)E: Direction\nOutput:Reason:\n\nThe first item that should be considered is the sentence that establishes the nature of the lawyer, to determine that \"successful lawyers must maintain the quality of integrity\" (A). This then enables the answerer to proceed with options B-E, which in most cases may involve the lawyer's personality.\n\nAs options B-E begin to be narrowed down, B indicates the \"earnestness\" (B) of a lawyer, which isn't very helpful as far as the lawyer's success goes. C indicates a \"good\" or \"positive\" attitude (C), which is of course necessary for a successful lawyer, but is not necessarily the most important attribute. D indicates a \"sense of humor\" (D), which is a personality trait that many lawyers may possess, but again is not indicative of success.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first three options are the first three in order in the logical reasoning section. This question in particular, as with many questions, has a fairly simple logical choice behind it. As such, the answer would be obvious if you know anything about the logical reasoning section. In this one, however, it may be hard to comprehend what the exact answer should be as well as the reasons behind it.\n\nLet's take a look at the options. \"They decided to hash things off over drinks after enough booze\" (A). This means that they drank a lot of alcohol, which would make them drunken. In this case, not being completely sober is definitely not a good idea.\nOption \"suicide\" (B) is obviously the wrong answer. Not only because it contradicts the fact that this question is the logical reasoning section, but mainly because suicide is an extreme case scenario, and would not help them to solve their issues.\n\"What would they do if they examined things?\" (C) sounds like it makes sense, but it doesn't, because there is no mention of them looking at anything. The fact that such an outcome is not mentioned does not make it a good option. \"What would they do if there was a \"tentative agreement\"? (D) sounds pretty silly, considering there just wasn't a tentative agreement in the first place.\nOption \"stay in bed\" (E) makes some sense. We all know the way drinks go. Drinks sometimes cause you to end up sleeping for hours on end. Because of that, this may seem like the most sensible choice, but consider this for a second. \"Staying in bed\" does not solve a situation and often worsens it.\n\nAfter all this, we've come to the conclusion that \"They decided to hash out things\" (B) is the correct answer. Why? Consider the original text again, it says, \"After enough booze they've managed to get close on a couple of things.\" This is enough information for us to know that they've started to feel a little more in sync. Because they've felt closer and managed to get \"to know a couple of things\" about each other, getting closer would probably lead to a more intimate outcome. That's why option (E) is obviously the correct answer - it doesn't even mention having", "answer": "A: reach tentative agreement"}

Or maybe he has a fear of dying or the unknown that would make him scared even in a situation that he would typically not be conscious.

If it is placed in a pantry, it would not be exposed to extreme environmental conditions that might speed up the spoiling process.

{"text": "Reason: The word \"grooming\" carries the connotation of upkeep, and this type of upkeep is for the purpose of looking good. The best option which captures this meaning is \"looking good,\" with \"beauty\" as the runner-up choice.

The researchers created a test \"that would examine the effectiveness...patients\" which can be inferred to be referring to a test that measures the effectiveness of anaesthesia in patients. Hence, \"examine\" also points to a process of learning to examine, which can be done by a test or by observing the results.\n\n## 48.\n\n## 62.\n\n## 73.", "answer": "E: neatness"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nWhen answering these types of questions, it's important to keep in mind the context of the situation and what the correct answer should accomplish. In this case, the key information is centered around the benefits of having the right book: \"to learn must have the right books\", giving us a clue into what the answer should do. Additionally, the scenario makes it clear that the ultimate goal is for the person to develop in skill or improve in some way - \"to work efficiently\", \"to become knowledgeable\", \"to have tools\" all describe skills development of some kind.\n\nThis means that options involving improving yourself or becoming knowledgeable are correct - option B is correct because it focuses on the individual developing by reading the right book. \n\nOption D is incorrect - it doesn't describe anything about what the person should accomplish after they've gained the correct book, nor does it address what the book is. It simply highlights the individual's qualities. \n\nOption E is incorrect - while it may be true that \"to have more knowledge\" is also a benefit from having the right book, it isn't mentioned as a requirement and doesn't directly indicate what the person should do after obtaining the book. \n\nFinally, option C is incorrect - it addresses having the right tool for accomplishing something, not having the right book.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be Choice B:  \"become knowledgeable\"\n\nInput: What should be the next step for someone who wants to be a doctor?

{"text": "Reasonning:\n\n\nIf the answer is to \"buy\" tickets at an \"amusement park\", then the cathedral and train station are unviable as they are used for various other functions than only buying tickets.\n\nThe metro station is a transportation hub, but is unlikely to sell tickets for anything other than transportation. Additionally, a metro station is unlikely to have many options to buy amusement park tickets, since these tickets would likely be purchased elsewhere.\n\nThe fairgrounds, on the other hand, are known for selling tickets to amusement park. They serve as \"convenient\" venues for buying, selling, and distributing tickets, and can house a wide variety for purposes, including amusement park tickets at an amusement park!\n\nTherefore, the final answer is E- fairgrounds\n\nInput: What type of transportation does suburban America use?

The cars and bikes are both relevant in the context, they are used for conveyance, but they are suburban. Moreover, the trains are also used for conveyance, and are used in the suburbs.

{"text": "Reasoning:\nThe question seems to be asking about electric fans that the hypothetical person might have. That narrows our search down to only five possibilities.\n\nThe first option (A) is the home, since that's where people have electric fans.\nThe second option (B) is the hardware store, but it's implausible for the person to go to the hardware store to cool their home.\nThe next two options refer to a specific room in the house, so there is no other plausible choice.\nFinally, the fifth and final choice is the \"office\". While this answer sounds unconventional, the question is only asking about temperatures the person is cool with, not where they want the temperatures cool.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first question to ask is what type of word is \"scary\" (a noun.)\n\nFrom there, it is helpful to group words to help the brain find patterns.  For instance, we look for nouns.\n\nThe next question is to think about what are the other words that could be describing \"scary\" (since we know it's a noun.)\n\nThe only other words that would be a common way to describe scary are \"terrible\", \"halloween\" and \"small.\"  \"Halloween\" doesn't fit since it isn't a compliment. \"Terrible\" is used to describe a negative or poor outcome.  \"Small\" is also ruled out for similar reasoning.  That leaves \"horrible\" which is our final answer.  The final answer is E: horrible\n\nInput: A man has his entire home gutted with a fire and it seems he loses everything he holds dear. The man's reaction is to what? Choices: A: get an additional life insurance policy B: throw a party C: get into a big argument D: go to the hospital E: do nothing for 2 days\nOutput:\n\nFirst we decide that \"man\" is a subject, not a verb or object.\n\nWe look for nouns, since \"gutted\" is an adjective. These would be the options: \"home\", \"fire\", \"things\", \"dear\", \"man\", \"party\", \"big argument\", \"hospital\", \"days\".\n\nWhat else can you think of that would be describing words?  These 2 are all that we're given, so now it becomes a matter of process of elimination.\n\nIf it was \"going to the hospital\" that option wouldn't be relevant if fire gutted his house, because he already has nothing left. \n\n\"Dear\" is an adjective, so the final answer is E.  The final answer would mean he does nothing for 2 days because he lost everything dear to him in the fire. \n\nThe final answer is E: do nothing for a minimum of 2 days", "answer": "E: horrible"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nTo attach something to wood, you would \"nail\" (A) or \"screw\" (D) it to the wood. \"Carve\" (B) would involve cutting away part of the wood, which wouldn't accomplish the goal of attaching something to it. \"Petrify\" (E) involves turning an organic material into a solid non-organic substance, so it isn't used in the construction of a wood object. \n\nThe term \"polish\" (C) could also apply here, depending on how you mean it. Polishing would remove a thin layer of material from the surface of a wood object so the object becomes more glossy or lustrous. However, \"carve\" and \"polish\" could both also refer to the removal of material, so it is difficult to tell which one of these two words the question refers to. Therefore, this is the most ambiguous option here. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D: Eat cake.  \n\nInput:Is there air in space? Choices: 1. No 2. Yes 3.

{"text": "Reasoning:\nThe scenario invokes a certain time limit for moving one's car, which suggests that the individual in the scenario is being penalized for not moving his car within that time limit. This makes option \"towed\" (A) plausible.\n\nThe next task it to understand the details of the situation and determine how being penalized would impact their behavior. If the answer included \"getting tired\" (D), for instance, it could be interpreted as a negative consequence and might cause an individual to get tired (and not move their car).\n\nOn the other hand, if the answer included \"getting a ticket\" (E), it could be interpreted as motivation for someone to move their car - either to avoid getting a ticket, or to avoid being towed. Therefore, this would support not moving one's car.\n\nFinally the last option is \"accidents\" (C). While moving a parked car to another location could result in accidents during the timeframe (e.g. someone banging into a parked car, or vice versa), it would be uncommon for those incidents to occur on such a regular basis that they required punishment. Therefore, this would not be a plausible reason for someone to get a ticket for not moving their car.\n\nSo the final answer would be C: driving\n\nInput: What kind of workplace does not have a casual dress code? Choices: A: military B: hospital C: office D: library E: school\nOutput:Reason:\n\nA casual dress code would be appropriate, and not uncommon, in the setting of a hospital. A military environment would have a completely formal dress code, which would go against the \"casual\" standard. Thus, option B (military) is eliminated because it's in direct opposition to the requirements of the question.\n\nThe same reasoning can be applied to the next three options that eliminate option \"office\" (C). These options all have formal dress codes, so the setting of the question must be an office without a formal dress code.\n\nHowever, it is common for schools (E) to have a casual dress standard to facilitate learning. On the other hand, a formal dress code is uncommon within a library (D). This means we can eliminate option \"library\" and leave the answer at \"school\" (E).\n\nAs for answer", "answer": "E: ticket"}
{"text": "Reasoning\n\nThe first task in approaching this question is to understand the scenario and the context of the question, and to identify the timeframe of the event. Option \"buying\" (A) would make sense in terms of what the character might do, but is in a different tense than the question (which uses the present tense of \"was/were\"). \n\nThe next task to do is narrow down the tense of the possible answers to the question. It would be unlikely to use \"was/were\" in the present tense for items that are currently on sale, such as in the context of this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the options that remain are \"buying\" (B) and  \"purchase\" (C). Both describe a purchase. However, the context and tense of the question suggest \"buying\" (i.e. something already available for purchase).\n\nThe final step is to determine the outcome or result of the purchase, and select the answer that makes the most sense. \"overpriced\" (D) would refer to an item that is more expensive than another item with the same characteristics, but does not make sense in this specific scenario (the game was on sale, so it would be a good deal, even if it was usually overpriced as opposed to another game). Answer \"wayto much\" (E) was the most plausible of the options because it doesn't make sense to use a single word to refer to \"expensive\" - if the game is overpriced, then it would already have been a good deal at the sale price.\nSo the final option is: D: was overpriced", "answer": "E: expensive"}

So, at the intersection, people would be expected to stand in any of the spots available at that location.\n\nBut, while there are no laws or laws requiring drivers to stop for pedestrians (especially if vehicles are moving at high speed, like on a freeway or expressway), many motorists would be expected to stop for pedestrian crossings in cities that have a lot of walkers. In spots that have a lot of pedestrians, cars and people would be expected to stop and wait, which creates traffic jams, which cause more delays, which cause more delivers, which increases the likelihood that a person crossing will get killed by a speeding automobile. In these cities, people at intersections would be expected more often to stand in at the corners or, crossing the road at a walk signal, stand at the corner of the road where the crosswalks are located rather than at the middle of the road.\n\nSo, the final answer is E", "answer": "C: street corner"}

She had just recently met several of her students and she was amazed how many things they seemed to know about that subject that they couldn\u2019t be bothered to learn what? Choices: A: read B: remember C: have D: find E: understand\nOutput: Reason(s): This question is testing us on our comprehension skills. The sentences are written to test how well we can understand the situation and apply a solution. In order to answer what the teacher is battling a losing battle in her classroom, we take note of the sentence that has two instances of 'were'. The previous sentence is not describing a moment in the past or a future event (the teacher has just recently met students, 'had just recently' has past tense) but instead is describing a current situation in the class she is teaching. If the teacher were still 'battling' it would mean she has yet to achieve the goal of regaining control of the classroom.  Thus, we can know that she has not been able to regain control and is failing so far, hence 'losing battle'.  We can then know that we are to choose an answer pertaining to how well the students are understanding, and not for how they are reading the material or how well they remember facts.\n\nInput:A scientist once made an amazing discovery.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nAgain, the first thing to do when solving this question is to break it down into its constituent parts.\n\nIn this case, we are asked what a chef does when he works in the evening. In cooking, the term \"working in the evening\" refers to the time just before dinner is served.\n\nBased on this knowledge, the following reasoning can be made:\n\nWe can eliminate options B (study french cooking) and C (taste sauce). \nIt's unlikely that a chef who works in the evening would be involved in French cooking, as the course requires a significant time commitment, which would likely clash with other job responsibilities. \nMoreover, the option to taste sauce only makes sense if he worked during the day, as doing so at night would not be beneficial.\n\nThe remaining options can be narrowed down to A (cook dinner) and E (thin sauce). The former answers the question - if a chef is working in the evening, he is cooking dinner for a restaurant, hotel, or other establishment. The latter involves the chef making sure that the sauce is thinned enough for it to be used.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is E, thin sauce\n\nInput: A chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for three-fourths of a cup of milk; in how many gallons of milk are 3/4 cups of milk?

Choices:  Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday\nOutput:Reason: Since each possible answer is on a different day, we can eliminate the following options based on what we know.\n\nMonday - They arrived at 3-40pm - There is no 3 in this. This is because the question states 'what day on what day' there must be another day following the day they arrived.\n\nTuesday - They arrived at 24pm - This is not possible because this would mean the day is a 2 hour time difference from 24 hours a day.\n\nWednesday - They arrived at o'clock - This is because it is missing a '2' from 52 hours in a day\n\nThursday - They arrived at 'o'clock' - This is because it doesn't have a 7\n\nFriday - They arrived at '530' - This is because there are not 2 numbers in the question, but 3.\n\nSaturday - They arrived at '910 pm' - None of this makes sense because the question never mentions pm or am, and there are no 1's or 10's in the question - if there were a 1, it must have been a 1 in the pm.\n\nFriday is the answer, because it is the only possible answer that works. \n\nInput:Sally and John went to a movie at 6:00 pm.

Thus, it makes sense that they would be the main focus on a football field. \n\nInput: What is it? Choices: A: cow B: buffalo C: cat D: baby cow E: calf\nOutput: Cow (B) is the correct answer here, as a cows are a type of buffalo. The term \"buffalo\" is actually used to describe a variety of large grazing animals, including yaks, bison, and even American bovines. \n\nInput : What do you call a cow that has one eyebrow? Choices: A : Cow B : One eyebrow C : Calf D : Daisy E : Udder\nOutput: Cow (A) is correct.

Choices: A ; Large horse B ; Pony C ; Fattened pony D ; Foal E ; Colt\nOutput: According to the standard American Horse Association system, any horse weighing over 150 lbf is considered a \"large horse\". Therefore, the correct answer is \"large horse\" (A). The terms \"pony\" (B) and foal\" (E) are irrelevant, as they are both types of horses that weigh less than 150lbf. \n\nInputs : How old is old?

If we have many people discussing the same subject, we will never get a solution because our brain cannot hold on more than one way to approach a problem. If we discuss something in one single way and focus on just one idea, it will be very easy to find a solution. So the right answer to this question is B.\n\nInput: An object is made out of material X. A small part of it breaks down into two units - Y and Z. In the same way, the rest of the object Y breaks into A and C. And the remaining part C breaks into B and D. 4D is formed during this process. Which is the substance which was present? Choices:  B: None C: A D: X\n\n\nThe output is : The answer is B. Material X.\n\nReasoning :\n\nMaterials don't break. Material X has gone through a chemical process to produce 4 units. So the original material X must be present in the end. Choose B.\n\n\nInput : An empty room has a number of chairs. Somebody enters the room and leaves the room without touching a single chair.

Based on this context, it's fair to deduce that James has the means to build his own garage.\n\nIt's unlikely that options \"bike\" (B) and\n\"tool storage\" (D) are correct, as \nthey would imply that James owns some very expensive bikes or a large tool collection.  \n\nThe answer option to the\nquestion is \"building\" (C)\n\nInput: I was going to move from Seattle to New York because they have what kind of building? Choices:  b: better fire codes c: better hospitals d: better apartments e: better schools\nOutput: Reason :\n\nFrom the given context, the key here is the use of the word \"kind\" (b-e)\nrather than \"style\" (d). A building can be described as having different styles - a brick apartment building,\nfor example, could have classic features and high-end finishes.\n\nThe building is likely to have different aspects, and the options that fit\nthis description are \"better apartments\u201d (D), and \u201cbetter schools\u201d (E).\n\nInput:What can you drink from on Thanksgiving,\nbut not on Christmas?

Choice C (\"Glass\") is probably too general - it could be referencing glass bottles or glass cups. \n\nIf we look at the other choices, Choice D (\"Cup\") is probably the best choice because it is referencing drinkware common\nat Thanksgiving but unusual on Christmas.

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nAgain, the purpose here is to understand why a person would break their leg. \"Breaking their leg\" is a metaphor for expressing one's own feelings or opinions. The phrase \"break their leg\" conveys a sense of anger, frustration, or embarrassment - so these options are eliminated.\nOption \"communication\" (A) is correct because it is a form of expression.\nOption \"laughter\" (D) can be eliminated because it is not a form of expression. Option \"pain\" (C) is incorrect because even though it is a form of emotion, it occurs when a person is in physical pain.\n\nThe remaining options are \"embarrassment\" (E) and \"suffering\" (B). Option \"embarrassment,\" however, is a temporary feeling which subsides after a brief period and is not an example of a prolonged expression of someone's own thoughts or opinions, so this option is eliminated as well.\nTherefore, the final answer is B: suffering\n\nInput: Why are there more boys than girls in this world? Choices:  They have different body parts.  A:  They have different genes B:  They like to play more. C:  They like to have fun.  D:  They fight less E: All of the above\nOutput: Reason:\n\nIt is suggested that there are more boys because there are more boys.

{"text": "Reason: As we've discussed previously, knowing the context of a scenario can help you eliminate some answers that seem irrelevant or out of place. In this case, the scenario implies some level of tension or strain in a marriage, which means the husband's likely to have a strong negative reaction to his wife's request.\n\nIn this case, options B (pleasure) and E (isolation) are both unrealistic and out of place in the scenario. \n\nThe remaining options would all be reasonable responses in this situation, but they're equally possible.\n\nIf the husband in question is indeed \"happy\" (A) or \"grieved\" (D), it wouldn't make much of a difference to his friends, who will probably feel the same way regardless. So neither of these options is a good choice.\n\nThe third option, \"happy\" (B), also wouldn't reveal much to his friends. The same applies to the fourth option, \"grief\" (C).\nIf the husband is \"sad\" (E), it is possible that his friends might also feel sadness or discomfort in his presence. However, it's more likely that they simply won't understand how he's feeling, resulting in awkwardness and incomprehension.\n\nTherefore, the best answer to the question would either be neutrality (E), or \"sadness\" (F), which would cause his friends to show sympathy towards him.", "answer": "D: grief"}
{"text": "This question's purpose is to determine if the person likes learning, as indicated by the options A-D.

Choices:  B: just show C: fast D: slow E: in easy way\nOutput: The answer is E (in easy way), to show that it is important to help the new person understand. Other options are irrelevant due to their negative connotations. For instance, C (fast) is not suitable because it implies to complete the task rapidly, which is not necessarily beneficial to the person. B (just show) is also problematic, as it only shows the person the task and does not take into account any other nuances, leading to a lack of comprehension on their side.\n\nInput:What type of learning can you do when travelling? Choices:  C: Learning to learn, Learning from someone else, Reading,  D: Making some notes, \nOutput: The answer for this question is C. Choices A and B are irrelevant because they do not fit the scenario of travelling. For example, \"learning to learn\" (A) is focused on gaining knowledge, which is likely not what the person travelling is looking for. \"Reading\" (B) is not a form of learning per se, and therefore cannot be considered a type of learning while travelling.

Likewise, option C and E are about going on vacation, but how can the person control the prices if he/she is going on vacation?\n\nHence, the final answer is choice A:Control.\nInput: The man was on a quest, what was on his mind? Choices: \nA: computer B: car C: phone D: house E: map\nOutput: Reason\n\nAs usual we need to find the context of the question\n\nIt is a man who is on a quest and according to the question 'he is on a quest'.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThere are several options for the first part - the child naming the giraffe \"a cow\", but all except B are irrelevant. A \"toy store\" (option A) is not necessary for the child to have an experience that would become a fond memory. A countryside (D) or wildlife refuge (E) does not necessarily have to be a fond memory either. There is no clear description of a fond memory in the question.\n\nAnd option C does not make sense - it's about the great outdoors, not the countryside. The question also uses the word \"what\" instead of \"where\", so we can eliminate C from the options. \n\nIt is also a little contradictory to ask why the mascot was named a cow, and then use the word \"now\" to indicate the mascot is no longer around. That leaves us just with the last three remaining options. But that does NOT necessarily mean option E is correct.  \n\nHere, the child in the story is now an adult. This could mean he/she had left the town or it may mean he/she had grown up. But regardless, there is no reason to assume that option E is necessarily correct. \n\nNow for the second part, the \"now defunct\", i.e. no longer around. There is a possibility that the mascot is a living, breathing animal, and simply has died. We cannot eliminate this option, because the context is not clear. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: story book, because of the last line of the story, which specifies that the giraffe is a character in a book. It is not a mascot, so the character is no longer around - it was simply a fond memory from a book.\n\nInput: Which of these choices describes the relationship between the two options?

Therefore, he wants to move somewhere where he doesn't have to rely on a car for transportation.\n\nThe first three choices do not satisfy the intentions of the man:\n\n\"Driveway\": The driveway is where he would park his car. If he has a car, he probably would not have decided to move.\n\n\"The scrap heap\": The man presumably would not want to discard his car or replace it with one that's worse.\n\n\"Parking garage\": Though it's a viable option for the man to park his car and take a bus, it doesn't reflect the man's desire to commute without his car.\n\nThen, based on the previous reasoning, we can eliminate choices: A, B, and C.

{"text": "Reason/Analysis:\n\nHere the problem has asked us to select the destination which would need a \"ticket\". For a \"baseball stadium\" (B) the answer is no. Although a ticket is required to enter the stadium, it won't take you any further to go to a different country.\n\nSimilarly, the option \"movie\" (E) is not correct either, because one might need to purchase a ticket to gain entry into the movie venue, but this won't help in traveling to a different country. Therefore the following options (A-D) will require tickets to travel to different country. Therefore as per the question we can say that \"a ticket would help you to get to A different country\".\nHence the final answer is A: different country\n\nInput:What part would you pull out from the ground if you wanted to make a table? Choices: \t A: trashcan B: firewood C: saw blade D: table E: shovel\nOutput: Reason:\n\nThe answer lies in the question itself, we'll be pulling OUT anything from the ground. Therefore the options D: table and E: shovel are out of the question. Next we'll have to be careful as one of the option might be an inanimate object which cannot be pulled out.\n\nTherefore as mentioned in Option A: \"trashcan\" cannot be pulled out.

Therefore, we rule out option B: \"to the ground\".\n\nAlso, option \"to its own nest\" is incorrect, since the bird would stay in its nest the entire time.\n\nThe only correct answers are \"to the north\" (D) and \"somewhere lower than the ground\" (E).

The detective is in fact analysing clues for his current case, so \"discovery\" is less relevant as an answer.\nThat leaves option \"thinking about\" as the correct answer.\nThe final choice: D: think about\n\nInput:The scientist needs to do what with the data?, to make sure he's got everything, for better understanding, to find out for himself, to know when the last time was B: he wants to what C: he wants to know D: he wants to learn more E: he wants to know best\nOutput: Reason\n\nAs with the previous puzzle, we will discern whether the scientist is gathering or analzying the information by looking at the noun.\nThere are two key words that can lead us to the correct answer: \"data\" (which connotes a gathering process) and \"the data\" (which could refer to an analytical process ). If \"data\" were used as a noun with a definite article, it would mean that the scientist is simply gathering information, and that would be a reasonable answer to this question. This isn't the case: \"the data\" isn't defined for us, and is the only option that uses the definite article to describe \"the data\", which means he is actually performing an analytical process (\"learning more\" could be a plausible outcome of an analytical process, but we can't know for sure).

The word choice \"where\" (F), is synonymous with the word \"with\" because Lindy is going somewhere with his children or with his senior. So we can eliminate choices (D) and (E). \nMoreover, it is known from the given context that the answer choices(B), (C) and (F) are not where seniors live.

Similarly, \"11 miles\" (3) has two more digits than the number of miles he ran in one day, and this too may be crossed off.\nThis leaves \"10 miles\" (1) and \"10 miles\"(5).\nIn the text of this question, it is stated that he ran three miles during the", "answer": "B: old people's home"}

(B), perhaps in the form of some sort of incentive for staying in counseling? But in the context of receiving counseling, that doesn't seem possible.\n\n\"Understand themselves\"? (D) is a plausible motivation, but still vague.

The verb needs to be closer to \"make.\"\n\nNext, we need to eliminate \"build\" (D). The correct answer should indicate a new barn or a new addition to the old barn. \"Build\" is too vague. It could mean a new addition to a barn or an entirely new barn from the ground up.\n\nFinally we eliminate \"entice\" (C). \"Entice\" is not an action verb that describes construction. \"Build\" or \"make\" would be better choices.\n\nSo \"build\" is a better choice.

This leaves us with the options \"spring \u2026\" and \"fall \u2026\"\n\nHowever, \"spring \u2026\" (B) is incorrect because spring is not a season on its own.

Therefore, the next action will be to walk to the cashier to finish the whole shopping trip on that day. But it's still too early for a shopping trip to be over. You don't have to go to the supermarket to find some shopping carts to get bags.\nSo it's not a supermarket.\nYou don't have to use a shopping mall because a shopping mall is a place where a shopping center is set up.

Hatred would not be associated with focus and what to it. It appears more likely that the focus of the great person would be compliments and positive reinforcement.\n\nOption \"surprised\" (B) would be unlikely, as a surprised reaction goes against the idea of focus and dedication.\n\nThe most relevant option is \"dedication\" (C), as the other three (competence, skills, etc) are unlikely for \"every person\" or \"great\". In conclusion, the \"focus and dedication\" to their craft is a better answer to the question. \n\nSo the final answer would be C: dedication\n\nInput: while luck plays a big role, every person who is great doesn\u2019t work in isolation. They draw inspiration from what? Choices: A: a mentor B: the crowd C: competition D: the stars E: the world\nOutput: Reasonening:\n\n\"Every person who is great\" is in the context of science and research, and science is based on collaboration. So it's unlikely that \"a mentor\" (A) would inspire \"every person\". Furthermore, the mentor would still lack the focus and dedication necessary to succeed.\n\nOption \"the crowd\" (B) is not supported by the context of the question or the nature of \"every person\" that is great. While \"enlightenment from the crowd\" would be plausible, it's unrealistic to think it would inspire the \"every person who\" to greatness.\n\nFinally the question seems to have missed an explanation on what \"luck plays a big role\". The answer choices seem to imply that \"luck\" (C) doesn't play any role in successfulness in this scenario. Therefore, \"the stars\" (E) and \"the world\" (B) both seem to be unlikely. \n\nSo then, answer \"the competition\" (D) makes sense.

He would not go fishing for what? Choices: A: three hours B: two hours C: four hours D: eight hours E: one hour\nOutput: Reason:\n\nIn the prompt, it is clear that the boy initially didn't want to go fishing, and is upset by his father forcing him to go. The option A: \"three hours,\" which is the amount of time the father says the boy should stay, is not a valid choice because the boy doesn't want to be there for three hours, and is upset with this requirement. \n\nThe prompt describes this as a \"forced\" act by the father on the boy - he \"forces\" the boy to stay there for two hours, which is why their relationship is upset. In addition, the father gives the boy \"only two hours\" to fish, which would mean that the son doesn't return for \"four hours\" as per the question.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer to this question is \"one hour,\" which is the amount that the father told the boy he could go fishing. He only stayed for one hour, before becoming upset.\n\nInput:  Choices:  A. Dad, have you ever felt lonely? B. No, Dad, have you? C. No. D. Yes, Dad. E.

Option \"complications\" (B) is also not an accurate choice because it implies that the term \"civil action\" carries some hidden complications that are difficult to understand, which is not true as we have already identified the meaning of \"civil action\" and confirmed that it refers to filing a lawsuit in civil proceedings.\n\nThe only choice that fits the context is \"arrest\" (D). The meaning of \"instituting civil actions\" refers to initiating civil proceedings is to initiate a civil lawsuit.

{"text": "Reasoned Explanation:\n\nHere, Bob needs a level to hang up a shelf, but there isn't a level in his home. The first step is to identify the available options, which include the glass of water (A), build evenly (B), garage (C), carpenter's (D), and video game (E). After this, the next task is to identify the options that don't fit the situation. For example, a \"build evenly\" (B) only builds a single object, which would be insufficient for hanging a shelf. Then, the task shifts to finding the correct answer. By process of elimination, we can say that only the carpenter's store (C) and the video game (E) don't match the prompt, leaving garage (C) and carpenter's workshop (D) as remaining possibilities. Both of these are places where Bob could go to get a level to hang a picture. Garage (C), in particular, is a location specific to his house where Bob would go to get tools. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Garage\n\nInput:What are two things that are never ending? Choices: 1. Happiness 2. Pain 3. Time 4. Anger 5. Difficulty\nOutput: Reasonable Explanation:\n  The first step is to clarify the context and purpose of the question. That includes identifying the items being compared (e.g., \"happiness,\" \"pain,\" \"time,\" etc.) and defining what \"never-ending\" means within the given scenario. \n\nBy process of elimination, option 3 (Time) is the correct answer. Happiness (1), Pain (2), and Anger (4) are all distinct states that can cease or be interrupted by external factors such as circumstances or people. The same cannot be said of Time (3), which is a dimension and, as such, cannot be \"cut to zero\" or be otherwise interrupted in a similar way as other options. Time is an essential factor in existence itself, which gives it an unfair advantage over the other options.\n\nInput: 2nd Grade teacher tells her class to take out a pen.

Choices:  B: walk C: hide D: sleep E: be lazy\nOutput: A simple grammatical error disqualifies the answer as factually correct. To say a chameleon will \"be lazy\" when not hunting implies the chameleon will be lazy more often than when hunting. That would be a logical contradiction.

It's not immediately clear that number-a is \"most computers that can run Windows\" and number-b is \"newest version of Windows.\" The context is the most important clue as to what the quantities represent.\nAnswering the question requires the understanding that the \"newest version of windows\" (2) would require the most computers, which would be those that can run windows (5) as opposed to the ones that can't (1).

The same principle can be applied to the question as above since you would expect the numbers to add to 5. However, in this case, it would be unwise to reason in the exact same way due to the fact that the answer given is incorrect.\nReasoning: \nThe first task is figuring out what kind of answer are being asked for.\nIs it only binary/boolean? No, since the question is an \"if/else\".\nIs it a natural number? No, since natural numbers do not include 0.\nIs it a fraction? No, since \"two\" is not a fraction.\nA real number? No, since real numbers do not include 2 or 0.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option is \"integer\", since the answer should be an integer.\n\nThe next task involves figuring out why the answer is 5. There are two reasons for choosing the correct answer; 1. A real number (integer) has an infinite number of permutations. The only remaining integer in the set is 5 (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0....etc.) 2.

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nFirst, it is important to determine what the question is asking about. The question suggests that it is asking where one would go to buy a good moistener, which eliminates options such as \"bathroom\" (A) and \"water\" (E), as these places would not be used to sell moisturizer.\n\nThe next task it to determine which of the remaining options are the most likely to be correct. Choice C \"drugstore\" is a common place to buy moisturizers, so it is probably a useful answer. However, choice A \"purse\" is less likely to be a place people go to buy moistener, so it can be eliminated.\n\nChoice B \"bathroom\" is a more obscure place to buy moisturer, however it is still a plausible answer, so it should not be eliminated just yet. Choice E \"hand lotion\" is another unrealistic answer, but should not be eliminated either, as it is still a possible contender.\n\nFinally we need to consider choice D \"hand lotion\" in greater depth.  While this is correct, choice B \"the bathroom\" is even more plausible, so the answer is B: the bathroom.\nSo the final answers are B: the bathroom\n\nInput:Where can one find great discounts on makeup? Choices:  The mall  The department store  An old lady\u2019s house  A friend\u2019s collection  Any thrift store\nOutput:Reason:\n\nFirst, determine what the question is about. The question suggests it is asking where one could find great discounts, which rules out everything in the question except for the mall and the department store.\n\nThe next step is to compare the answers and eliminate those that are more improbable. The answers \"old lady's house\" and \"any thrift store\" are out of the question, because it seems that finding such a bargain would be more likely at the mall or department store rather than at either of these places.\n\nThe last step is to choose the best option. The mall is a common place to look for discounts, while the department store is not so common, so the answer is the mall. So the final answer is The mall (Mall)\n\nInput:What does the", "answer": "C: drug store"}
{"text": "Reasoning:\n\n\"Glee\" (D) would be the best choice here, since it is the most accurate word to describe the feeling of being happy, joyful, or cheerful. Options such as \"being happy\" (B) and even \"injuries\" (E) don't fit as tightly as \"glee\", because those words aren't as well defined for this context.\n\nSo the final answer would be D: glee\n\nInput: A girl was staring out the classroom window. She had too many what? Choices: A: worms B: insects C: dogs D: dogs E: fish\nOutput:Reasonung:\n\nThis question is similar to Driving Question above. To find the most accurate choice, pinpoint what the girl is specifically starring. It becomes more precise if you know that the question states \"many worms\".\n\nThe first few options don't make for an accurate choice, because they don't meet the criteria. For example, \"Many insects\" is too general to consider, and \"Too many dogs\" doesn't match the given context.\nThen, the last choice, \"Too many fish\" seems to work, but it is a bit inaccurate. The girl is staring out the window and wondering what the fish are doing. Is she trying to count how many fish there are? Or trying to identify what kind of fish they are? There's no way to know. So the best choice is \"Too many worms\".\nSo the final answer will be A: too many worms\n\nInput: What is the definition of the phrase I'm trying to describe?

Choices: \nA: two lines of the outfield B: home plate and first base\nC: two end zones D: two stripes E: no stripes F: two base paths\nOutput: Reason Answer:\n\nThe first two options are too broad. Neither \"two lines of the outfield\" (A) nor \"home plate and first base\" (B) is a precise description of the boundaries on the field. Similarly, the last option \"two base paths\" (F) is not a correct choice since a ball can travel in any number of directions as it is hit.\n\nThe most straightforward option, \"two stripes\" (C), correctly identifies that a baseball diamond has two colored stripes.

Jungles may be described as \"savannahs\" found within forests or woodlands.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be C: savannah\n\nInput: Are all human beings mammals? Choices:  a: yes b: false/no c: yes d: no e: false/no\nOutput:Reason:\n\nOption \"false\" is clearly incorrect.\n\nOption \"no\" is incorrect because humans are in fact mammals, so this would mean \"no, all human beings are not mammals\" wouldn't make logical sense.\n\nOption \"yes\" is incorrect because this would make logical sense in a multiple choice question\n\nOf the remaining answers, \"yes\" and \"no,\" option no would imply that \"no, all human being are not mammals,\" which again doesn't make logical sense, and \"yes\" doesn't make sense in an inverse manner.\n\nWe are thus left with only option E.

{"text": "Reason: A is a possibility but it is vague\n\nThe first task here is to interpret the meaning of \"toasted\" which is the closest option. The next task is to identify the subject of the situation - \"everyone\".\n\nSince the action is collectively performed by other people, the only logical thing that can be the subject who is 'doing a certain act or activity' is 'toast'. The last task is to identify what that activity is.\n\nSo, from the options available:\nEvery everyone raised a drink and [toasted](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/toast). The activity should be to raise a drink and cheers. But the next sentence clearly tells that the drink is being raised as a toast. \n\nSo option A is correct because it is the only which fits the context and purpose of question.\n\nInput : The kids went on their own holiday last week, and they were able to have a great time because they were all what? Choices: A: adventurous B: curious C: hungry D: scared E: smart\nOutput: Reason : Since the kids had a great time. They should be brave and adventurous. Not hungry, scared and not smart as all of these qualities are not helpful there.\n\nSo the first task is to interpret the first sentence. It is obvious that these kids had to have gone somewhere and they had a great time from the second sentence, which implies that this great time had to be their holiday.\n\nNext task is to identify the holiday purpose of kids.\n\nThe next task comes is about what purpose, and which of the qualities can make their holiday more successful.\n\nSince they had fun in their holiday, their should be braver and adventurous, and not something different (A, B, C).

{"text": "Reason: John feels a feeling of happiness.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the type of thing John is getting, which is determined by the context of the sentence. The context implies that something good and significant is about to happen to John. Therefore (D) is an unlikely option because it seems unrelated the context provided by the sentence.\n\nThe feeling is related to getting something, and to the significance of getting it. But the sentence doesn\u2019t provide any more details. We can rule out the option A: then have (C) by thinking of what else John might do to get whatever it is he is going to get.\n\nIf John were to receive something important or significant, we can reasonably assume that he would feel some emotion other than \"headaches\" (B) \u2014 that being a strange choice and not likely to be a normal feeling for someone receiving some big news.\nFinally, John could feel happiness when he gets something important.

The question specifies that the job is \"dancing and waving an ad,\" so the advertisement itself must be what the person is dancing and waving.\n\nTherefore, the options that would fit the context are: magazine, web page, or advertisement, in descending order of likeliness.\n\nBut the keyword here is \"outside.\" If the advertising is on the street or even in the parking lot, we rule out options \"Bus\" and \"magazine.\" Option (B) would be correct if the advertising were inside the store itself.\n\nSo the final answer would be for magazine, B: magazine and the correct answer would be an option B: magazine\n\n\nInput:How did the person who didn\u2019t know how to ride a bike learned how to pedal a bicycle?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first portion of this question provides a clue to help eliminate 3 potential choices (C, D, and E). Why would someone put their leg up on a hospital bed, ladder, or piano?\n\nOption choice \"spinning wheel\" (A) has a logical sounding context: it's a logical answer to a question about where to place your broken leg. But spinning wheels, although useful for spinning threads of yarn, are not commonly used as beds.\n\nOptions choices \"hospital bed\" (C) and \"legroom\" (D) also seem logical at first glance, because the word \"hospital\" and \"legroom\" suggest that they could potentially be used to put your legs up. However, these are only partial meanings of the terms - they're only one aspect of the complete meaning.\n\nHospital beds are typically used to care for someone who is sick or injured, with the bed positioned in a position where the patient can be cared for easily.\n\nIn the context of a single person in a hospital with one broken leg, hospital beds would not be used to elevate their leg for healing.\n\nLegroom is technically an appropriate answer to the question - the name \"legroom\" implies that it refers to a place in which you can put your legs. However, this is typically something that applies to planes, where you can put your legs up in the gap between seats. (This is especially true when sitting in the exit row or in the emergency row.)\n\nOption \"grand piano\" (E) is even further off the mark. Grand pianos are the largest type of piano, with a massive frame and large keys. In other words, grand pianos are large and heavy. It's not that they would not work to support the broken leg of a single individual, but it's not an intuitively obvious answer choice.\n\nThe correct answer choice is option \"spinning wheel.\" It would make an unusual, but not totally ridiculous answer to a question asking where someone should put their broken leg. And so the correct answer is spinning wheel.", "answer": "C: hospital bed"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step in solving this logic problem is to identify the types of entities involved in the question. In this case, the question refers to different types of food, which can either be \"boots,\" \"deserts,\" or \"loaves of bread.\" Each of these entities are defined by their shape, and their common goal is to contain something. This information can help narrow down the answer choices.\n\nThe question can also be helpful in identifying possible incorrect answers. For example, the answer \"hocks\" is incorrect because it refers to a person's foot. Looking at the other incorrect choices, however, a more appropriate answer would be \"bread\" because all of the other entities are food, while \"hocks\" is not.\n\nWhen considering the other answer options, it is important to remember the context of the question and to focus on the entity's purpose. For example, boots are a type of shoe that protect the feet. Therefore, the answer option of \"boot\" is incorrect. Similarly, \"deserts\" are a part of the Earth's surface, and \"loaves of bread\" are a type of food. In contrast, \"bread\" is a food item, so it is the correct answer.\nBy considering the entity's purpose, the goal of containing something, and remembering the context of the question, the correct answer of \"bread\" can be determined.\nSo the final choice is BREAD", "answer": "D: foot"}

Cuisine is definitely not a drying place, so neither is cabinet. Kitchen is obviously a place where you can dry a coffee mug, so the answer is B.\n\nThe problem with this question is that you need to have knowledge of French cuisine to be able to answer it correctly.

Why is this happening?\n\nLet's figure out why this situation has happened - you know there is manager, but don't know his name. We're given clues that there is \"T\", and \"manager\", so they must be related. The T-word must be related to manager. Let's remove all other choices from the options and find the related words T and manager by using the process of elimination. We eliminate them all one by one. The choice of \"the chef\" could only be used (if it belongs to the right category) if \"Chef\" could also be said to be related to \"manager\". This is not the case so the choice of (D) is incorrect. If the related word is \"M\" then \"Manager\" can be made to end with \"M\". None of the other choices contain M, therefore, \"M\" must not be related to manager. That means choice (C) must be the correct one.\n\nThis question is a little bit more abstract and requires some critical thinking to solve.

One way to do this is to identify each number and see if it belongs to a sequence. 1 is already invalidated due to being impossible (since 1978 < 2015). Choices A and 2 belong to a sequence, so they are both eliminated. \n\nSince 2 does not follow a sequence, the next step is to identify any other numbers that fail to follow a sequence as well. We can easily eliminate choices E and F, as they do not follow any obvious sequence.\n\nChoices B and D can both be evaluated for whether or not they follow a sequence, since B + 6 and C - 9 both can be calculated. For B, the answer is 2,022, indicating the year is not logical. Similarly, for D, the answer is 47,902, also ruling that choice out. \n\nThe only left logical choices are C and D.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nAs soon as the context of the question has been established (\"James [is] interested in\u2026\"), we can eliminate any options (B and C) that describe James as an individual, thus eliminating \"zoo\" (B) and the \"school\" (C). Now, we can make a case that James might \"dream of being on\" the space shuttle, but the context also suggests that he prefers the red planet to any other, so this would be an unlikely scenario. This leaves us with the option \"library\".\n\nIt's possible that this answer is supposed to describe Mars as a location, but in that case, the \"c\" in the question should be capitalized to identify it as a place (as in, the \"school\" location). \n\nAs it turns out, the question is asking about James's preference, in which case \"library\" is the correct word choice, because libraries exist here on Earth and books are usually found there.\n\n\n\nInput: You should never lend cash money to family. Choices:  A B  C  D E\nOutput: Reason\n\nIn this case, we have to consider all parts of the sentence. \"You should never lend c ash money to family\" is in a passive voice (e.g. \"cash money is lended\"), which means that something other than the family is the actor, which could be the reason. We can eliminate options A (lended) and C (lending). Then we need to parse the sentence into two units: \"You should...\" and \"never lend cash money...\" This places the first unit in a subordinating position as a causal conjunction (\"should\") and the second unit in a subordinated position, which is the main verb (lend). The first unit, then, is a clause. The second unit is a main clause, which means that the remaining main verbs are A, B, D, and E.\n\nAs we compare each option to this rule, we can eliminate option C (main clause and the main verb can be neither in the sentence). We can also eliminate option D (main verb requires a noun; there is none in the original sentence), and option E (main verb must be inflected; it is present in the original sentence.) The remaining options are B, which is the only choice that fits the rule.", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

The options C and D suggest cafe and bar, which makes little sense. Neither of those things have anything to do with looking for \"large menus.\" Item E has the most appropriate context of the set: the internet does have many options when it comes to trading digital currency.  Item A is a type of advertisement but doesn't have anything to do with the scenario presented. Finally, item A is a type of news, which gives it a sense of context with this situation, though it's the incorrect answer. There is no news advertisement in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is B.", "answer": "E: internet sites"}

But a notepad/b00ker is portable and can fit anywhere on you.\n\nThe most logical answer is choice C. In short, option C doesn't make any sense. The question doesn't make sense if it's a large and stationary notepad.\n\n\n\nInput: What fruit contains the most sugar? Choices: \n \nA: Lemon\nB: Grapefruit\nC: Watermelon\nD: Apple \nOutput: Reason\n\nTo answer this, we immediately disregard any fruit that contains no sugar. In that sense, apple does NOT contain sugar, hence we can eliminate choice D.\n\nWe then eliminate fruit that contain very little sugar because of the way the question stated \"contains the most sugar.\" An obvious counterargument to this rule is that in some extreme cases, it is possible that one fruit could contain the most sugar and another not even contain any. But, this is not likely when we're asked about \"the most.\"\n\nSo of the remaining option, we can disregard citrus fruits, grapefruit and lemon because they taste too tart for many people. For that reason, option C is also eliminated.\n\nWatermelon can taste very sweet, so it is plausible. Watermelon is made up of 92", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

Most articles would only express a local, small event.\nOption C: worrie: This is a misspelling \"worried\" is not a word which means anxious or apprehensive and not similar to a worry. Also, this option was written \"conern\", not concern, but also not worrie. This does not seem to mean anything and may be unintentional. The correct word is \"worried\".\nOption D: education: This fits the context of the question and its purpose of informing people about local events.\nOption E: learning about world: Option D is more specific than option E which is why it is the best answer.", "answer": "D: education"}

Viewing a tv show is not the same as \"being bored\" or \"nothing else to do\", which would indicate that there were no other entertainment options available, or that the viewer was simply trying to avoid something.

{"text": "Reason: The question asks us to determine where a large village may be located, and we can infer the answer by context clues. When we think of a large village, it is likely to be found in a rural area where the people are isolated and far removed from the bustle of a big city.\n\nIn addition, the answer \"Ohio\" (E) seems like a silly answer for a variety of reasons. First, it is not a country and therefore, it makes no sense to use that term to describe a large village. Secondly, it appears to be in the middle of the United States and would not be considered to be a typical rural area.\n\nFurthermore, the answer \"suburbs\" (C) seems to fit the question at hand, so it can be eliminated. This answer suggests that a village would be located near the countryside, which makes sense given the context clues provided.\n\nThe answer \"big city\" (B) seems logical as well, as the term \"big city\" typically implies the presence of a large population, which could make the village a part of the city. However, this answer has been ruled out due to its inconsistency with the context clues.\n\nFinally the remaining answer is \"countryside\" (D). This answer makes the most sense given the context cluses. It is logical to think that a village with many residents would be found in a rural or countryside area, far from the busy streets of a big city.

A little research online can confirm that many touring circuses travel to South Africa.\n\nAnswer:D: South Africa\n\n---\n\n#### \ube60\ub978 \ucd9c\ucc98: \n[\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5b8\uc2a4 \ud574\uc124 MCQ - \uc815\ub2f5\uc744 \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\ub294 \uae38](https://yunbom.tistory.com/28)\n\n---\n\n# Question 2:\n\n1. How are the answers to questions A & D on page 105:\n\nInputs: The patient said she did not feel hungry, the nurse said yes, because? Choices: \nA: she had to take food to the patient B: she thought it was rude to decline C: in case the patient's hunger was a sign of an underlying problem D: the standard response E: the patient could not speak for herself\nOutputs: Reasons:\n\nThe nurse's statement is not unacceptable under question A, but it is an irrelevant reply. Although she could take food to the patient, she is not obligated, and taking food is not necessary to make the patient feel less alone. Question A is about how she felt, not what she did. She answered more about what she did than how she felt.\n\nThe answer is wrong under question D. It is true that a patient who cannot speak for herself requires a nurse to be the patient's advocate. But she has not fulfilled this responsibility by feeding the patient.\n\nThe right answer is E because you have a patient", "answer": "A: french government"}

Choices: 1: 2 2: 8 3: 0.6 4: 64 5: 25\nOutput: Reason\n\n3.3/ (3*2=6)*(3-2)*8/64\n\nReasoning: You must understand the context behind the question in order to form a reasonable hypothesis. In this case, the question is clearly asking about physical distances between two points, and not a complex mathematical calculation.\n\nThe options can be quickly eliminated based on their lack of relevance. 1, 2 and 7 are wrong, because those distances aren't relevant to a physical distance. The others range from 0.6 to 64, but those are the distances between kilometers and other units of measurement, not a kilometer to another kilometer. This narrows the options down to 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n\n4 is closer to 64 than to 3.3, so we can eliminate options that aren't closest to their target. 4 and 5 are close enough that the two options should be tested in equal portions. Of the two, 4 is closer to 8 miles than 64, so 4 is the correct answer.\n\nReason: If you're unable to figure out the answer because you're unsure which units are being referred to, you could ask for clarification from whomever's asking you the question, or just try to reverse the units of measurement to make sense of the problem.\n\n##### Note:\n\n-A: You should read a list of options carefully and look for clues as to what each option means before you select one.\n\n-B: There are many correct option in this question.\n\n-C: You must pick up on the context of a question in order to pick the correct option.\n\n-D: The correct option is the one that the writer intended to convey, \n\n-E: You should understand the context of a question before select any option.\n\n-F: You should pick an option that fits the context and the information", "answer": "A: cupboard"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nThis question is essentially asking where the term \"motorway\" came from, which refers to the common term for a highway in England. The only country that uses this term is England, and therefore the answer is E: england\n\n\nInput: Where do they speak french? Choices: \n\nA: england  B: switzerland  C: nigeria  D: japan  E: india\nOutput: Reason\n\nThere are many countries where French is spoken as a native language, including countries in Europe and Africa. The answers that should be discarded are those that aren't countries (A), and aren't associated with French (B) and (C, which do include countries that speak French). This leaves us with the question of which country speaks French. The answer is E: India.\nIt doesn't necessarily have to make sense as the question asks for \"WHERE\" in response, not necessarily the \"HOW many\"\n\nThe question is simply asking which European country is the biggest. The choice \"England\" doesn't make any sense as the answer, since England technically isn't a country. Therefore, the answer would be England.\n\nThe question asks you to write the country of the capital city. This implies that the country name won't necessarily start with the capital city's name, since there may be a lot of capital cities, not just countries. In addition, the question doesn't give information on the population or area of the capital city, which would be useful if they were explicitly given as an option. Therefore, the answer is France.\n\nThe answer has very little to do with the size of the countries or populations. Based on the context, it's clear that the countries are in Europe, and the capital city must by in Europe as well.\n\n## Explanation: (2) \nThe question asks \"in which European country is capital city Frankfurt?\" which means that Germany is not the correct answer. \n\nIt can be answered by noting that the countries of Europe are located in the continent of Europe.\n\n## Reasoning: (1)\n\nThe questions asks if there is a type of bicycle that does not fit this category.

Choices:  (C)  (C)  A) B) C) D)\nOutput: Reason:(https://prnt.sc/sQmKxOc7U_Lq)\n\nFirst thing to do is to know the task, which is to choose the correct letter.\nThe first letter does not have the word \"me\" and the last one has it. Thus, we can narrow down the options to (C) or (D).\n\nNext we can eliminate the incorrect options.\n\nOption (A): The word \"me\" does not mean it is exclusive to the person as we can see that the letter starts with \"t\".\n\nSimilarly, Option (B): The second part \"and her\" implies that her husband does not have his own car.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n\nInput: I have three children, three brothers and three sisters.

But since they are all odd, one could read it as follows:\n\"I was born in the year three, the year five, the year seven, and the year nine\", which doesn't make sense. Furthermore, if the sentence was referring to nine dollars specifically, it would say \"give me five ones.\" So the sentence can't make sense as written.\n\nInput: What time is it?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step is to identify the task at hand. In this case, teachers need to prepare for a new school year. This suggests that teachers are doing something necessary to prepare themselves for the new school year, such as setting up the classroom before students arrive.\n\nOption C \"teach children\" is unlikely because the teachers are not preparing themselves to teach children at the time, but are rather preparing for the new school year.\n\nOption A is definitely irrelevant because this is not a time for teachers to \"talk too much.\" Instead, they're getting organized and set up before the students arrive. \n\nOption B, \"answering questions,\" is possible, but this would be part of a teacher's teaching responsibilities during the school year, rather than a preparatory task.\n\nOption E, \"giving homework,\" is irrelevant because homework is given during the school year, not during teachers' preparations for the school year. If anything, homework would be part of teachers' preparations during the school year, so this answer choice is also out.\n\nOption \"giving homework\" (E) might be tempting, but the passage specifies that this is the \u201cschool year,\u201d not \u201cschool day,\u201d meaning that teachers can already give homework during the school year when it\u2019s time. The reason that teachers haven\u2019t already made enough progress is because their work during the school year is too time consuming.\n\nThe best answer is letter (E): giving homework (100%)\n\nInput:  People believe that scientists and researchers use computer networks to create what?

The lips are indeed on the hand, which is a more common response than the mouth. The lips are part of the skin, and the hand is part of the skin, so you can also say the lips are on the skin, which is the only part of the human body that the hand is also on.

The context is for pepper and salt when a meal is \"bland.\u201d You should eliminate options that are not related to food such as Supermarket (A) or cellar(D). Then, the first thing you do is to add the word \u201cmeal\u201d to options. These options are Supermarket and water. To confirm that the meal is bland, the options are grocery store and soup. Grocery store is the answer.\n\nInput: A company needs to hire someone who can perform what job well? Choices: A: build a bridge B: draw a map C: get a bounus D: make a movie E: go to the moon\nOutput: Reason :\n\nThe first thing we need to eliminate is irrelevant options that the companies do not need to hire anyone for. The options A and B can be taken away. Now, the next step is to figure out what \"the job well can\" represents. There are four choices that could be a good fit, namely, get a bounus, make a movie, go to the moon and draw a map. However, the options get a bounus and go to the moon are eliminated since these are not something humans normally do. Thus, make a movie and draw a map are the ones we need to figure out and they are answered with option D: make a movie.\n\nInput: After the rain, what can you eat from a wet tree Choices: A: the leaves B: the fruits C: the sap D: nuts E: buds\nOutput:Reason:\n\nThe first step is to eliminate the wrong words which is from a wet tree.

But the question suggests studying, with the context of an assignment. Therefore, this is an invalid option.\n\n\"College class\" (B) does fit the appropriate context of the question, and is certainly a place where a student could spend most of his time studying for a report. However, the report mentioned in the question is due tomorrow, which suggests he already has a good understanding of the material and therefore cannot spend his time acquiring knowledge in a class. As such, option (B) would not be the answer to the question\n\n\"Classroom\" (C) is plausible in that it's a suitable place where a student might spend most of his time in preparation of an assignment.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe option \"texas\" (B) is wrong because \"best\" implies \"best of the best.\"  So James can't be in Texas, which is a fairly average state.\nNext, the option \"building\" (C) is wrong because the sentence mentions only a steakhouse, not a building. Also, if James is in a building, he's not outside the South.\nSimilarly, neither option \"michigan\" (D) nor \"florida\" (E) would apply, because James is going to a steakhouse outside the South, not Michigan or Florida.\n\n\nOnly one answer is left.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step of this question is just to read the words. Clearly, customers do something while they're in the store - they're looking for an item. In short, this question wants to identify customers. The options \"hunt\" (A) and \"spend money\" (D) describe a more active (and sometimes combative) nature, when in fact, many customers just look around the store while waiting on someone to help them. \"Mail orders\" (C) and \"demand satisfaction\" (E) aren't feasible possibilities for a customer in a store.\n\nBecause customers aren't hunting for anything, or waiting for a package to arrive, or looking to \"demand\" something, the answer is A:  hunt.\n\nInput:The doctor was treating a patient he did what? Choices: A: gave the patient a cup of water B: asked him a question C: ordered medicine D: told a story E: touched him\nOutput:Reason:\n\nFirst, this question invokes a doctor - so it's safe to assume the patient is sick. That eliminates options A (give a cup of water) and B (ask a question).\n\nThe only thing the doctor would be touching is the patient's hand - an option that doesn't make sense in this scenario. Option D (touch him) is clearly out of bounds.\n\nBecause the doctor is treating a sick patient, asking him a question (A) or telling him a story (C) is probably the worst thing the doctor could do. However, ordering medicine (B) for the other patient is a reasonable option. While the patient may not want to say that he's sick, it makes sense that the doctor - a trained professional - would order whatever he thinks the patient needs.\n\nTherefore, the final option is B: ordered medicine.\n\nInput:If an object is stationary, it has what property? Choices: A rotation B movement D acceleration C speed E speed plus acceleration\nOutput:Reasoning\n\nThis question is really meant to stump you with a hard concept.

The bank will give you 1.7% percent (1/100) compounded quarterly for 4 periods (years) if you invest the money with the bank. However, the bank states that it will be worth 0% percent if you choose to do nothing. If you want to receive 17%, which choice should you take? Choices:  (A) Invest for 4 periods (16%) (B) Do nothing (0%) (C) Invest for 8 periods (17%) (D) Invest for 12 periods (17%)\nOutput: Reason: If you invest with the bank then you earn interest, and if you do nothing then you don't earn interest but you don't lose anything. Since you need to invest 100, and compound the sum in the account to 101 and then take 17% of the 101 so to get $101 x 1.22 and this is the bank offering you to invest 101 for 17% interest after 4 years then \n$$ \\begin{align}\\text{The answer is: } &  101\\times0.17\\\\ & =17 \n\\end{align} $$ \nso the answer is invest.\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the multiple choice questions . \n\nInput: The sum of a series of 7 consecutive numbers is 55.

While it could be tempting to choose it because of the word \"liquor\", the choice would be inappropriate for this scenario. Excessive drinking would hardly solve feelings of loneliness, and might even exacerbate it, especially if the person is alone while drinking and reflecting on the reasons for feeling lonely.\nThe only feasible answer is D: socialize, which fits the description for the best solution to a lonely situation.", "answer": "D: socialize"}
{"text": "Reasoned:\n\nThere is an underlying assumption in this question that \"old clothing\" is something that is found in homes. Therefore, people don't necessarily purchase such clothing, so trunk (A) and bookshelves (D) are incorrect options. Similarly, washing machines (E) aren't common places for clothes found.\n\nTo be able to access clothing in homes, people might keep it in drawers (C) or suitcases (B). These two answer choices fit the context of the scenario well.\n\nFinally there is an outlier answer of a suitcase (B). This isn't because it makes no sense (it does), but because this is the least obvious choice of all.

(B) - Pies are not commonly eaten as a dessert in this day and age (unless there is an occasion).\n\nIt is not very likely that the manager would bring cheesecake - though this is possible, cheesecake would simply not be enough to mark 20 years of the companies existence.\n\nAnd finally, it is unlikely that the manager would bring ice cream. (A) Ice cream is a dessert made of cream and is not celebratory like pie or cheesecake are.\nHence the final option (A) is the correct answer - Cobbler. \n\n\n### Instructions:\n\nInput:What is the name of the book that is read in the classroom?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step is to identify the possible meanings of each option in relation to the context of the question and the question's intended goal.\n\nOption \"Drawer\" (A) would likely be used for storing small pieces of paper, such as receipts or paperwork that the user would only store temporarily. It doesn't fit the context of \"files\" which usually refers to documents or other larger items that would need to be stored in a drawer.\n\nOption \"Filing cabinet\" (B) makes more sense. It's common practice to store large and important documents in a filing cabinet because it has many drawers to provide ample room for organizing and storing documents.\n\nOption \"Computers\" (C) is less likely because it may not necessarily store paper files. Additionally, it doesn't have the same capacity or organization features as a filing cabinet.\n\nOption \"Desk\" (D) would likely be used to store papers that the user needs to access quickly, such as a desktop calendar or notes. However, it wouldn't be a fitting choice for storing large or important documents since it doesn't offer drawers or other storage compartments for filing purposes.\n\nFinally option \"filing cabinet\" (E) is the best choice. A filing cabinet provides drawers with multiple compartments to store documents and it is a common office furniture used to organize and store paperwork. It is the most accurate answer to what office furniture store paper files.\n\nInput: Can I drink water to get it? Choices:  What do you mean by that? What do you mean by it? What does it mean? What is it? Why not? Can you give me an example?\nOutput: Reason\n(1) The word \"it\" could refer to either 'water' or 'drink'.

There is no explicit reason why we would expect marijuana to be used by happy people or the like.\n\nFinally notice that option \"intoxicating\" (D) is actually part of the question, which would eliminate other answers that do not contain this.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is D: intoxicating\n\nInput:When you\u2019re at lunch you want some what? Choices: A: bread B: noodles C: rice D: eggs E: fish\nOutput:Reasonning:\n\nHere, eliminate any options similar to \"bread\" (B) or any options that are specifically \"noodles\" or \"rice.\" It wouldn't make a lot of sense to have a full meal at lunch, given the context of this question. \n\nThe next step is to reason that there's probably something to do with fish. Here \"fish\" (E) isn't the exact language of the question, but the next most specific answer (Fish) appears, so that answers the question directly.\n\nFurthermore, no similar answer to \"Fish\" is present in the choices set, eliminating the options F: Chicken and J: Pizza.\n\nThere's a strong chance that it's a simple question asking for the food item(s) that go well with fish.\nFinally, this means that, since lunch is typically a meal, it would be logical to assume that there'd be some form of a meal involved, making the answer \"meal\" the most likely. Thus, the final answer would be E: fish and meal", "answer": "B: neat"}
{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nInput:This question is fairly straightforward, and could be inferred from other questions posed on the test. Here, the company is \"going public\", meaning it is listing itself for trade on a public stock exchange.\nGoing public may be done for a variety of reasons, such as to obtain more funding or increased visibility with investors by making the company more attractive to potential investors. However, it is unlikely that this action is taken to \"reveal information\" (A), since the company would be putting itself on the stock market. It would make more sense for the company to do so because it is looking to obtain some of the benefits a public listing provides, such as higher visibility with investors and potentially more funding. Likewise, it is unlikely that \"being ridiculed\" (B) would be a driver of a business deciding to go public. A business would most likely do so to increase its visibility in the financial markets and obtain more trading volumes.\nAs far as being \"ridiculed\" (C), this scenario could certainly be an incentive for a company's management team to go public, since such a listing would increase the company's profile in financial markets and could bring increased investment from new or existing shareholders.\nFor option E, it could be argued that disclosing information about the company, a purpose of going public, could be used to attract new investors and increase funding.\n\nThe most appropriate answer, though, is B: \"being ridicule\" because it is the most sensible and relevant reason. It is common for companies to go public because they want to increase their visibility in the financial markete.\nSo the final choice is C: problems\n\nInput:How would an investor who buys a stock typically expect to earn a return on his or her investment?Choices A: more than market return B: dividends C: higher return than market return D: dividends E: lower return than market return\nOutput:Reason:\n\n1.B:Dividends.

Out of these two options only one of them answers the question, and that is \"grocery store.\" The word \"grocery\" can be defined as a chain of stores that sell produce, meat, drinks, toiletries, and the like.

Option \"desire to win\" (B) is not suitable because it does not emphasize the desire to win, which is the primary characteristic associated with competition. Furthermore, the word \"win\" (B) is often used in relation to sports, whereas \"rivalry\" (D) has no sports connotation.\n\n\"Friendship\" (E) describes a situation where two people work together, but there is no intention to win against one another. In sports, where competition is common, friends would likely face each other as opponents, not allies. Therefore, the correct answer is \"rivalry\" (E)\n\nInput: Which day will there be the most of what? Choices: A: rain B: day D: clouds\nOutput : Reasonning:\nFirst, all options are eliminated that is not related to weather.\nBecause options (A) and (B), rain and day, are on the answer choices, there really is only one remaining choice (C), which is clouds.\nSince the word \u2018more\u2019 describes what the person will do or will have.\nSo the correct answer is option (C): clouds.", "answer": "A: edge"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nFrom the scenario, one can assume that the subject (seeking a place to sit) would want to be in the same room as all of those people facing the same direction. Thus, option 'C' - a theater - is not suitable.\n\nSimilarly, options 'A' (conference) and 'E' (church) would not work - conferences are generally not the same room as all the attendees, and churches typically do not feature rows of chairs facing in the same direction.\n\nSo among options 'D' (floor) and 'B' (theater), 'floor' seems to be closer to the desired seating arrangement.\nSo the final Answer is (D) = (floor)\n\nInput: Is \"a\" an adjective? Choices:  Yes, they are (A)  No, they're not (D)  Yes, they need to be (C)  No, they do not (B)\nOutput: Reason\n\nYou can see this isn't an easy question to answer. There are multiple points you can make, and it all comes down to interpretation. On the other hand, the answer is not all that important... because that is what the judge is asking for.\n\nThe best option here is option (C). Option (D) is too harsh, and seems to be implying that it's not a part of the English language, which is a little difficult to be.\n\nOption (B) tries to justify something which is not needed here. In short, option (B) is incorrect.\n\nOption (A) states that it's simply an adjective. Again, it's not all that important to know whether it's an adjective or not.\n\nOption (C) correctly answers whether 'they' are adjectives. Since 'they' is not given, the statement would be incorrect for 'they' to be adjectives.\n\nThis concludes that option (C) is the choice. So, the final answer is option (C) = \"Yes, they are, in fact, adjectives.\"", "answer": "B: theater"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first thing we need to determine is what the keys can be attached to. That's probably a pocket. So the only choices that make sense, therefore, are A, B, and C.\n\nThe second criterion we can use to eliminate incorrect options is that the keys must come together as a single thing rather than be scattered about - in other words, they must be attached to a single thing. The keys to a purse (D) and piano (E) are clearly attached to two separate things. So these both must be wrong.\n\nOf the remaining options, \"Front\" isn't really a \"thing\" at all, so it would be incorrect to say a purse is attached to a \"front.\" So once again, two answers remain: A, B, and/or C.\n\nIt's then possible to determine which answer is correct by narrowing the options down a little bit. The key of the \"chain\" answer, B, doesn't come before the key of the \"front pocket\" answer, A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: the keys were attached to a chain.\n\nOutput: The woman was reading a book what was the book about? Choices: \n1: cats \n2: turtles \n3: birds \n4: monkeys \n5: mammals\nOutput: Reasons:\n\nThe first step is to read all the possible answers and eliminate any that aren't possible based on the clues. This means that we can instantly cross off'mammals' because we are told specifically that the book is about some other animal.\n\nThe second step is to eliminate the choices that are impossible, again, based on the clues that we know about the book. Birds and mammals are clearly impossible, since they are not mentioned, and the book is about an animal that is not a bird, so the answer must be one of the other three.\n\nThe next logical step, as is the case with most questions, is to eliminate the least-plausible explanation first. Given everything we know about the book, it is highly unlikely to be about one animal that was mentioned, turtles. It must therefore be either cats or monkeys. Because turtles and cats are the same size, it does not really make sense to assume that the book is only about one animal unless we", "answer": "E: piano"}

Choices: A: An army man\\ B: A person without guts\\ C: A person without teeth\\ D: A baby\\ E: A healthy person\nOutput: Reason for choosing C as answer should be: The answer is, that \"A baby\"(D)can eat the most ice- cream in a day without becoming fat. He should not choose the option with B which is a person without guts(even if he is a healthy person). Because he has no teeth. Even if he has teeth, he can't eat. \n\n### Instruction:Answer the last question.

{"text": "Answer: C\nReasoning:\nThe second task is to isolate the correct answer. Kids (and adults, for that matter) don't purchase over-the-counter treats at a butcher shop (B). The next options (D, E) are both reasonable options that would cater to a general audience. However, we know the shop must sell snacks, as the question was about 'over-the-counter treasures'.\n\nThe answer of choice (C), though vague, best matches the information we have - it involves a commercial establishment where a general audience would frequent. Given the context of the rest of the sentence, it's likely that kids would visit a bakery or confectionery.\nSo the final option is C: confectionary\n\nInput:The first step in writing a report is A: collecting data B: analysing data C: summarising data D: finding data E: choosing format\nOutput:Answer: A\nReasoning:The first task is to deduce the meaning of the words in the question. Option A is the most basic and obvious interpretation, because the question specifically states that reports are compiled based off of \"data\". When writing a report, we need to go find this data to begin with!\n\nOptions B and C are similarly obvious, because report-writing involves these activities. Option D is misleading as well since there is no obvious context as to why the report is being written.\n\nThe last option, E, is ambiguous. It's not obvious what a report format is. The question could mean the format in which the report is written down, such as on paper or on a computer.\n\nHowever, in the context of this question, the choice seems to refer to the layout of the report as a whole. It might even imply that the report is divided into chapters or sections to make it more accessible.\nSo the final choice is A.\n\nInput: What is the temperature of a red hot iron?

In that context, E is the more correct choice.\nThe answer is E:Dorm", "answer": "B: hotel"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nOption \"landscapes\" (B) is incorrect because it refers to the landscape view of the painting. This information is given in the second sentence of the prompt, meaning that the options must refer to \"to capture the view\" - not \"view\" in general. Furthermore, the mention of the artist being \"famous for his very plain...\" (E) makes it apparent that he was famous for his minimalist approach to painting rather than something such as east side location (C).\n\n\"Middle America\" refers to the country of Mexico. This could refer to Mexico's location in Central America, making all of Central America a part of Middle America, but this isn't an option provided. Additionally, using \"east side\" (C) or \"middle america\" (D) would imply that the painting was based in one of these locations, which would be incorrect.\n\n\"Georgia\" refers to the country, rather than the state. This contradicts the idea that the artist is famous for painting a particular view of his \"plain\" nature.\nThe correct answer, therefore, is E: Plain.\n\nInput: What is a 1959 horror?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nFrom the question stem, the first option that springs to mind is \"human body\" (C). Since ghost towns and third-world countries can't be infected with diseases, so this has to be A or D. But human body might be infected with virus.\nSo we have to choose between B: third world country and D: rug\n\nThe first thing to note is the presence of the word \"spread\" in the given question. That suggests that infection is a possibility. So option B: third world country fits the context as a place where disease might spread.\nHowever, if we are to consider that fact, it's unlikely that the researchers in the context would ever set foot in such a place without disinfecting their shoes. Therefore, we can infer that rug, the sixth option (D), is most likely what they're talking about.\nInput: What's the best way for a scientist to travel to research stations if they wanted a smooth transport without interruption?

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nContext: The snake's habitat should be determined by the context of the lab. Option \"nightmare\" (B) is the best choice, because the snake is most likely residing in a nightmare and needs to be brought back. Option \"tropics\" (A) is incorrect as the scenario suggests the snake needs to be brought back to its natural habitat, not simply its natural habitat.\n\nContext: The second context is the snake's size and appearance. Since the snake is \"large\" and has \"spots\", it's likely to be a pit snake, as mentioned in the question. \n\nOption \"nocturnal\" (C) means \"active at night\" and the scenario invokes a snake that wakes up at night - indicating it's likely not a pit snake, at least not based on what we know so far. Similarly, option \"black with a big head\" (D) is incorrect, because the snake has \"spots\" and is large, meaning it would be unlikely to be a black snake with a big head.\n\nThat leaves \"feild\" (E) and \"bushes\" (E). Feilds are often open, whereas bushes offer shelter, making them an ideal place for a snake to hide and hibernate.

We want a set of instruments that would be appropriate for a larger performance of classical music and that has at least one string instrument. We can eliminate options B since it is talking in terms of a \"band.\" We can eliminate option A since the other options in the choice do include string instruments.\n\nThe options \"orchestra\" (D) and \"string quartet\" (E) do include string instruments. They are plausible options for the full string ensemble (string quartet) as well as a full string orchestra (orchestra). Therefore options D and E are the best options.\n\nHowever, option D refers to a string ensemble of any size. It could be an orchestra or a quartet. Option E refers specifically to a quartet and could in fact refer to either a string quartet or a string quintet if one were to play the viola together. So the full answer would be both \"string ensemble\" (D) and string quartet\" (E).\nSo the final answer would be string ensemble and string quartet\n\nInput: What would you find inside a musical instrument? Choices:  B: musical scores C: a musical note D: a song E: musical instrument\nOutput: Reason :\n\nFirst, we should eliminate the options that do not include musical instrumentation. Option B is a song, which is a collection of musical notes arranged in a tune. Option C is a musical note, which is simply a single and discretely identifiable source of sound from a musical instrument, and does not make mention of other instruments. Option D is a song because it has something to do with music, but is not an instrument that would be found inside musical instrumentation.\n\nOption E is a musical instrument.

It suggests the grapes are involved in a process that transforms them or makes use of their properties in some way. \n\nNext, identify which of the choices are relevant to this transformation, and which ones are not. Option \"juice\" (D) is not an accurate answer choice, because grapes are not used in the process of making grape juice. Similarly, the option \"fruit cocktail\" (C) implies that the grapes are mixed into a fruit cocktail, and therefore are not used in their original form.\n\nThat narrows our answer choices down to two: \"picnic basket\" (A) and \"wine press\" (B).

Choices:  a: formal, b: informal, c: bad, d: good, e: etiquette\nOutput: Reason and answer:\n\nOptions which seem unlikely are often eliminated from a multiple choice question, and these options in particular suggest very unusual ways that piratical manners would differ from one another. For instance, option \"formal\" (A) - implies that piratical etiquette is different than formal etiquette - is less likely to be correct than the simpler option of \"informal\" (B) - which says that piratical etiqutte would be the opposite of formal etiqutte.\n\nOptions \"bad\" (C) and \"good\" (D) are confusing. We can eliminate either of them without even reading the remaining options, because the question never suggests that piratical manors are good, bad, or both.\n\nFinally option \"etiquette\" (E) is a bit of a dead giveaway. It suggests that a modern, urban, polite piratical culture would be unlikely, which leads us to the final option of \"B\" -- informal manners -- as the correct answer.\n\nInput:What is another name for the famous scientist, Sir Isaac Newton?

{"text": "Reasonning:\n\nAs with the previous question, you first have to define the context of the question before making an accurate answer choice. The only correct option here is \"stable\" (A), because the question implies that a horse would probably live in a place where it could find hay and food. Stabling, or putting the horse in a place where it gets its food, would be an obvious choice. \n\nThe remaining options are false because the question does not even mention stabling. You wouldn't expect a horse to be at an arizona petting zoo, which is a zoo that only offers stables where you buy animals. The remaining locations, arizona and farm yard are both inaccurate. \"Arizona\" is a state rather than a farm, so the phrase \"on a farm\" would have to be in the question. \"Farm yard\" is inaccurate since there are many types of places on farms. It implies that farms are only used for growing hay/food, but most farms also offer livestock for sale and agricultural businesses for their products.\nSo the final choice is B: stable\n\nInput: What is the missing character on the card above? Choices:  The card has a heart, club, diamond and spade, but no  A: eight\nOutput: Reasonining:\n\nAnother basic reasoning task. Notice that the card has hearts and clubs, but no 7 or 9, which eliminates options B (\"one of either a 7 or a 9\") and C (\"only one of either a 7, 8, or 9\").\n\nIn the remaining options, the question provides us \"an equal number of diamonds with hearts\", which is a logical conclusion of the question. It indicates that the question card should have hearts and a spade. Hence the card is missing an 8 (not 0 or 1), which is present only on the spade. So the final answer is A: eight\n\nInput: What are the two correct answers A: (5-3) =2 and (5/3) = 1.666 B: (5-3)+(5/3) =8 and (5/3)+(5-3) =9 C: 5 is less than 3 and 5 is greater than 3 D: 5 is less (smaller) than", "answer": "D: farm yard"}
{"text": "Reason\nJames uses a clipboard, but which of the mentioned locations would he use to keep it?\n\nWe need to first understand why James keeps a clipboard in the first place and what it contains before we can try to answer this question. A clipboard is a flat surface that can be used to hold papers. Based on the provided information, we can assume that James keeps a clipboard specifically for holding his papers. It is reasonable for James to store his papers on his desk, as it would be convenient and easy to access. Additionally, if he needed to take his papers to another location outside of the office, he could take the clipboard with him. Finally, a clipboard would be ideal for jotting down notes or writing important information that he could not capture otherwise. Based on these considerations, we can conclude that James would keep his clipboard on his desk.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is E, school\n\nInput: The store assistant saw the man trying on the same blue jacket five times.

The scenario says nothing about the orange. That means the possible answers are only going to be one of the other fruits.\n\nA: Pear (1) is a fruit that is not an apple.\nB: Grape (2) is not an apple.

Also, the answer D is not logical as a photographer does photography for fun, and not \"with a person\". The only options we have to choose from are the answers B and E.

{"text": "Reason:\n\n\"Bean bag chairs\" are soft, fluffy seats that are typically meant to be relaxed in, rather than sat on or used for work purposes. Thus, the correct answer for this question is house (A), family room (B) or wood (C) to indicate that the chair is better suited for relaxation, rather than a workspace where you're sitting on a solid surface, such as a desk.\n\nA den, as defined by the Oxford Dictionary, is \"a place of privacy or seclusion\". This includes private rooms in a house that are meant to be used for specific purposes. For that reason, den (D) should not be included as an answer to this question.\n\nSimilarly, we can exclude floor (E) because in most cases, floor surfaces are not desirable for sitting on due to their texture, firmness and lack of furniture.\n\nThe answer to which choice is most appropriate depends on the context of your situation; however, in general, wood, family room or house would fit for most settings.\nSo the final choice is C: family room\n\nInput:What did the man get from the bank? Choices:  (A) $100 (B) $1000 (C) $15000 (D) 10000 (E) $100 000\nOutput: Reason :\n\n(A) is inaccurate as written because it is not a statement about money. The question does not specify the type of currency, so it could be referring to dollars, euros, or pounds. (B) and (E) are inaccurate because they state the same exact value. There is no need to express the same number using different units, so answers (B) and (D) should be eliminated. (D), while a reasonable choice, does not provide enough information for it to be the correct answer. The bank would not send 1,000 dollars to a man's house if he only applied for 1,500. Therefore, this is an incomplete sentence, making it \"ungrammatical\". Hence, the right answer is (C): $1500 \nso the final answer is C: $1500\n\nInput: Who is the chef?

It mentions one part of the answer, but leaves out another part. The actual answer is actually \"limejuice\", which is a refreshing beverage that is served at the juice bar mentioned in the clue. But option B only mentions \"lime\", which is one of the ingredients in limejuice. By choosing this option, the player is trying to figure out \"limejuice\", but not necessarily \"lime\".\n\nOption C, \"square\", is a false statement. It is not possible to get shape in the form of a square. So this option is not credible or legitimate.\n\nOption D which says \"gym\" is a bit of a misleading choice. The clue indicates that the answer is located inside a juice bar, so it doesn't make sense to choose this option.\n\nFinally option E: \"refrigerator\", is the correct answer.

Also, the sentence is specific about pandas being the choice of display animal, which means koalas cannot replace them.\n\nNow consider the listed choices: all of them are choices of environment that pandas live in. The fact that two locations are named and one is a geographical area in China eliminates the answer choices \"jungle,\" \"australian outback,\" and \"bamboo grove.\"\n\nOnly \"child's book,\" one of the options that doesn't fit the pandas' natural environment, is the right answer.\n\nSo the final answer would be E: child's books", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

This is further reinforced by the phrase \"usually expected\" in the question, which implies that adults are typically expected to take care of these financial responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, \"speak to each other\" (E) is not a typical expectation of adults. Speaking to each other is a relatively informal interaction, which is not always necessary or appropriate for adults.\n\nInput: Which of the following best describe what a bank uses to give loans? Choices: \n\nA: savings B: financial history C: credit history D: tax report E: income\n\nOutput: Reason\n\nThe key to identifying the correct answer is to pay close attention to the exact phrase used in the question: \"what a bank uses\". This means that the options provided should not be used by a bank in loan decision-making, but rather should be used by borrowers.\n\nBased on this definition, \"savings\" (A) isn't a suitable answer, because it doesn't describe what a loan is used for. Likewise, \"financial history\" (B) is also excluded, since it doesn't give a loan directly.\n\nInstead, \"tax report\" (D) is the best available option here. A tax report is a document that shows the amount of tax a borrower has paid, which is a crucial piece of information for a loan decision.\n\nFinally. \"income\" (E) is also ruled out since it doesn't involve a bank's use of a document.\n\n\nInput: I\u2019m worried.

Furthermore, it is unclear why less confusion would make line-standing a \"good choice.\" \n\n\"Boredom\" (D) is not a valid answer, since it does not fit the scenario. It is true that standing in line may result in boredom, but that would not explain why Dan chose it.

Grooming is a term that people use regularly in an advice-giving context to describe good hygiene habits.\n\nWe can exclude option A (\"neatness,\" which is more commonly used to describe a person's organizational skills), as well as option C (\"selfishness\"), which doesn't make sense when referring to a person and doesn't line up with previous context.\n\nNext, we can eliminate choice D (\"cleanliness\"). \"Cleanliness\" is a word that is often used in a physical sense (e.g. the act of thoroughly cleaning something). A greasy teen isn't necessarily in need of a physical cleaning - in fact, they probably would benefit from avoiding any such cleaning practices because they can be counterproductive.\n\nThe last two options are \"better understanding\" and \"satisfaction.\" The latter could describe the positive emotional outcome teens might get from adopting good hygiene habilitations, but this is not specifically what is being asked for.\n\nThe appropriate answer is \"better understanding,\" because grooming is likely a reference to \"grooming,\" which in turn means good hygiene habilities. Option E \"better understanding\" answers the literal meaning of the question based on the context of the question and makes the most sense as the correct answer.\n\nInput: Why does eating too much candy give some kids toothaches? Choices: A: tooth decay B: germs C: bad habits D: too sweet E: bad bacteria\nOutput:Reasonning:\n\nHere, we can see from the context of the question (e.g. \"toothaches\") that there is a person who is asking a question and providing a specific answer. Given the nature of the question and its answer, this context would seem to imply that the speaker is a doctor, parent, dentist, etc.\n\nThe options of \"eating too much candy\" would seem to fit here. \"Bad bacteria\" makes sense as a concept, but doesn't quite fit what is being described and what the answerer is providing. A \"toothache\" in response to eating too much cake is probably not caused by a single type of bad b", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step in answering this question is to carefully consider the context of the situation.\nAs we can infer from the word \"formal\", this might an occasion that the speaker is dressed to attend or is attending a party.\n\nSecondly, notice that the choices offered do not offer much information. The choice \"Being sociable\" (B) indicates that the food might be meant for socializing rather than eating. This does not seem to be a common practice in most formal meals and thus is unlikely to be the correct choice.\nThe choice \"Medium\" (E) refers to eating in a moderately fast way. Similarly, it is unlikely to be a common practice to eat at a formal meal in a moderately fast manner.\n\nThe remaining choices, \"Sit\" (A), \"Talk\" (D), and \"Drinking\" (C), are all fairly common manners associated with eating at a formal meal. By process of elimination, it is likely that the correct choice is \"Talk\" (C).\nTherefore the answer is \"talk\", \n\nInput:What would \"Sir Peter\" say about the weather?

It will be easier to find the correct answer.\nChoice (A) indicates that weather will be favourable. This suggests that we can exclude Choices (C), (D) and (E), as they all seem to indicate that the weather will be unpleasant. \nIn Choice (B), the speaker will talk about a heavy rainfall, which is unlikely in winter or summer, so Choice (B) can be eliminated, too. Choice (A) also indicates that the weather will be nice during the winter. Thus, \"There will be a heavy rains\" (B) and \"...will rain\" (D) can also be eliminated.\n\nIf weather in winter is nice, there would be cold and unpleasant weather in summer, so that the weather", "answer": "A: sit"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nGiven the context that the man is on the street corner showing off a wrist watch, the only possibility for him to sell this item is at a pawn store. Of the other options, option B (a jewelry store) isn't a place one would expect to buy a cheap watch (let alone pay good money for a wristwatch - the man would likely be looking for a pawn in this case). Option C (a hock shop) is also excluded because a hock shop is a type of store where they make purchases out of pawned goods from customers - in this scenario, the man on the street corner would be most likely looking for someone to buy his pawned watch, and thus a store of this nature wouldn't be best suited to do so. Option D (a watch store) is excluded because a watch shop specializes in offering more premium brands, as opposed to a cheap watch that is being touted by the man on the street. This leaves only option E: a pawn. Of the other options that are viable options for a pawn store, there is nothing here within the context to provide information about the man's motives for selling the watch - thus option E is not only a viable option, but the only one that can be answered to this question.\n\n\nInput: A couple went on a second honeymoon and while they were gone, their dog ate what?

Option B is not plausible here, because a dog cannot eat a cat, and the couple have no pets at all. Option C is not plausible because a dog cannot eat pets food - it would probably throw it up after a few minutes of eating.

{"text": "It's a pretty straightforward question. What kind of radio does someone \"use\" to reach base? You'll have to use your reasoning skills to find the right answer. If it's a question about equipment, choose a \"piece of equipment\".

In this way, you would \"use\" the car in the same way.\n\nSo here, since this is a multiple choice question, it will help us to first eliminate irrelevant options before selecting the best one.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nReason: The first thing to get clear is what \"made from milk\" refers to. At first glance, it may seem as if it simply means food made from milk, such as pizza, or macaroni and cheese. To understand what \"made from milk \" more widely refers to, consider the following definition from [Merriam-Webster online dictionary]\n\n    \\em{made:} adverb 1 : made from materials (such as timber, metal, or stone)\n\n    \\em{\"built-in shelves\" or \"built-in bookcases\" are made from various materials}\\em{\u2014J.A. Adande, The New York Times, \\em{Feb. 24, 2001}\n\nThis definition suggests that \"made from milk\" can refer to anything created from milk, which includes but is not limited to food made from milk. It is therefore possible to find fungus growing on \\em{anything} that is made from milk, such a cheese, the insides of a shower stall etc., however it may be uncommon or unlikely to find fungus growing in the decaying matter of a cheese. As such option C (old cheese) would be a more likely answer to the question.

Furthermore, the term is often used when mentioning the equipment available to us on a task, which aligns with the context suggested by the scenario.Thus the final answer is A: Equipment\n\nInput:What term would you use to designate a large expanse of land?

In B, C and D, we see that these options are closely associated with the construction of building and vehicles. By contrast, option E is unrelated to the rod.\n\nWe now know that a rod would most likely be found in a construction site or in engine.

The answer by getting out of the bed could not apply to a Teddy bear because this involves getting out of bed and not out of the whole house. The answer by getting a shotgun is wrong because this involves having a weapon in hand and the bear could not be in range to grab this.The answer by making a lot of noises does not make the bear go away but disturbs the rest of the neighbourhood!

Rectangles are already a certain shape, thus they cannot be used to determine the length and size of a rectangle.\n\nOption B (\"squared\") is technically incorrect - although using the word \"squared\" implies that you are referring to \"squared,\" the term you are actually referring to is \"squared root,\" which is the actual answer to the question. Additionally, the use of the word \"root\" is more commonly associated with a square than a square root.\n\nOption A (\"squared root\") is a very specific type of square root referred to in geometry (square to the power of itself). The root we are looking for, however, has only been referred to by the name \"square root\" so far in this exercise.\n\nOption D (\"surrounded by one square\") does not make logical sense as an explanation of \"How to determine the length of a rectangle.\" If we assume that this option means \"the length and width are determined by the square,\" then it is simply a circular explanation of how to measure the length.\n\nThe last option, E, would be the correct answer, because the word \"square root\" answers the question.\nSo final answer is E: square root\n\nInput: Which is the largest of the following numbers?

The phrase \"it helped her to have an OUTLINE\" is incorrect grammatically, as well as indicating that, by \"giving her an outline\", something helped her.\n\nOption (ii) is incorrect. Given the context of 1 minute, option (ii) directly contradicts what helped was supposed to be effective at helping her prepare well.\n\nOption III may be tempting because it sounds similar \"to remember to practice well\".

Furthermore, the term \"East Coast\" is typically used to refer to the coast of the Atlantic Ocean located east of the United States.\n\nOption B is incorrect as Boston has a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean and is located in Massachusetts on the New England part of the U.S. coast. \"Beach Town\" refers to a type of town or city known for its proximity to the ocean and often has sandy beaches, like Florida.\n\nOptions C, D, and E are incorrect because North America is a geographical continent composed of North America and parts of Central America. Although the coastline is located along the east, North America also covers a vast inland territory.\n\nThe best answer would be \"coastal cities,\" because it is the correct spelling for the name of these cities. Coastal cities also have large beaches, many of them are popular vacation destinations, and some even have ocean views on the other side of town.

{"text": "Reasonning:\nHere, the question asked about the child's parents being led to spend money on microtransactions, which is quite possible, as there is nothing in the question that suggests that microtransactions are in fact free. \n\nThe first task after understanding the context is to determine the outcome of the story. It is obvious from the question that the parents were led to spend money on the microtransactions and the options (A) and (B) indicate that this is not a possibility, which means they are irrelevant to the question.\n\nThe next step is to narrow down the context of microtransactions within the scenario. That narrowed down the context to one with children, a scenario that is likely a mobile game, as parents of younger children would be less likely to be tricked into spending money for something on the phone or tablet of a young child.\n\nThe last step is to determine the outcome (or purpose) of the microtransactions. If the parents had been tricked into paying for microtransactions, then the outcome would be to lose money. This eliminates options (B) and (C). \n\nThe option (D) makes no sense with the story, as the child's parent would be unlikely to use microtransactions in the first place.\n\nFinally option (E) is the answer to the question because the outcome of the child's parent paying money for microtransactions is that they were \"caught\" and this outcome fits with the wording of the question.", "answer": "D: paying"}

Choices:  Allergies, asthma, sinusitis, hay fever, rhinitis, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, sniffle, sniffles, headcold A: allergies B: hay fever C: viral sinusitis D: common cold E: sinusitis\nOutput:Reasonning:\n\nEach option in the choice lists is a separate medical diagnosis involving either the symptom of, or condition caused by, viral sinusitis.\n\nOption \"allergies\" (A) has nothing in common with viral sinusitis, as it refers to a predisposition toward certain medical conditions (such as an allergy to pollen), whereas sinusitis is not an allergy itself but a complication caused by certain allergies.\n\nOption \"hay fever\" (B) also does not share a common trait with sinusitis. Like allergies, it refers to a pre-existing allergy to something else - in this case, hay pollen. So it too can be eliminated from consideration.\n\nOption \"viral sinusitis\" (D) shares the common trait of being a type of medical condition involving sinusitis.\nOption \"sinusitis\" is the same type of condition specified in the answer choices, and is the most likely to be associated with viral sinus.\n\nThe final correct answer is then option D: viral sinusity.\n\nInput:There are 5,", "answer": "D: street"}

Choices:A B C D E\n\nOutput: Reason elimination:\n\nThe only feasible solution to the question is option E: feeling better. If the person was already at home, it would mean that he had already \"stayed home\", thus eliminating B and C. \"Rest\" and \"feel better\" are also a logical pair of words that only describe feeling better. The person who wants to feel better would do what the doctor said to do: rest more and stay home to recover.

As such:\nOption A: 3 days and nights: This means a total of six 24 hour periods. To make this number of 100 hours, either the nights would need to be made bigger (6 x 4 = 24 hours, which is less than 100 hours) or the days would need to be made smaller (6 x 24 = 144 hours, which is a lot more than 100). Therefore, this is incorrect.\nOption B: 3 nights and days: Three nights means a total of 72 hours, which exceeds the 100 required. Therefore this is incorrect.\n\nThe only way to get 100 hours would be if one of the nights and days were shorter. To get 100, option 3 (2 days and 3 night) fits as it is made up of:\n3 days: 21 hours + 12 hours = 33 hours.

Choices:  The cat is on the mat A: The cat is on the chair B: The cat is on my chair C: The cat is on your bed D: The cat is on our mat  E: The cat is on its mat\nOutput: Reason : Except C, remaining sentences are compound and not complete.\n\nHere, we can see that \"cat\" is the subject - it is doing an action and has a direct object that follows it in each sentence (mat, chair, bed, mat). The sentence \"on the chair\" is actually a verb phrase that describes an action going on in two nouns (cat and chair).\nSince there is no such thing as \"on my [noun]\", it is not a complete sentence, and does not function as the subject of a sentence. The same goes for \"on your [noun]\". As such, this sentence does not contain a subject and needs to be crossed off as the correct choice.\n\nThe two remaining sentences are compound sentences composed of two independent clauses. While they contain many parts and words (such as gerunds, infinitives, and participles) they are grammatically complete sentences when taken together. Thus, these are the only options that contain the subject, and therefore, the correct answer.\n\nSo the final answer(s) is(are) A: The cat is ON THE CHAIR B: The cat is ON MY CHAIR.\n\nInput: What should we do when faced with a situation like \"I feel terrible today?\" Choices: A: Tell everyone your opinions, like politics B: Just tell them about it, like weather C: Tell people what happened to you E: Talk about how you feel because D: You may not be able to tell them about your problems\nOutput: Reason:  A and B are unrelated to this question at all.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nIn this question, we can eliminate the options \"gain weight\" (B), and \"dispare\" (D).  The question doesn't mention how heavy the respondent is, nor does it mention weight gain. Therefore, option A, \"gain weight\" must be ruled out.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"all of her efforts\" in the scenario is indicative of the respondent's goal of losing weight. So she wouldn't be dissatisfied with a weight gain.\n\n\"making larger\" (E) falls into the same category described above, as well as \"augment\" (C).  She wanted to lose weight but continued working hard at her efforts to do so. In a scenario where she was trying to gain weight, she wouldn't continue to do what she's currently doing, which would be \"work out\" or \"exercise\" or \"exerciste.\" So, this also cannot be her current activity.\nThis brings us to option D, \"dispare,\" which means \"to become depressed or despondent\" and \"make smaller.\" Clearly, Jamie wasn't losing weight. But, she wouldn't keep exercising if she wasn't successful or otherwise dissatisfied with the outcome. So she wasn't dispare, either.

The option \"transfer of information\" would be a better fit than the other option, as the noun phrase \"communicating\" refers exclusively to the \"transfer of information.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the most appropriate word for this question would be \"transfer of information,\" therefore it's the final answer.", "answer": "C: progress"}
{"text": "The correct answer is E -> spending money.\n\nThe purpose of this question is to test our knowledge about the psychology behind shopping.\n\nOption A, \"desire\", should be eliminated because there is a distinction between \"desire\" and \"needs\".

In other words, a \"desire\" to shop would not be the dominant factor in driving someone's purchasing choices, as it is by definition less important than other needs.\nOption B, \"money\", is eliminated because of its negative connotation. It would be less accurate to say that someone's purchase choices are driven by a lust for money, suggesting that they are primarily motivated by greed and materialism.\n\nThe focus of this question is on the psychology behind shopper choices, and it would be more accurate and less biased to describe their purchasing motivations as what they \"spend money on\" or what they have a \"spending habit\" towards.\n\nSo the final answer would be E - Spending money\n\nInput:The manager thought of a plan to make his employees happy, because the workers have a high what, they don't expect much to begin with?

It suggests that the focus of the question is on employees who work for the company. That would eliminate irrelevant option \"budget\" (E), as it would be uncommon for the manager to consider the company budget in terms of employee needs and morale.\n\nOption C \"needs\" is eliminated because it is a general term that could refer to any of several different criteria. \"Needs\" would not be the dominant or primary factor the manager considered when deciding to implement a happiness program, so that option would be less likely than \"expectation\" or \"morale\".\n\nOption D \"morale\" is eliminated because the use of the word \"morale\" suggests a concern about the mental state or well-being of employees, as opposed to simply acknowledging their basic \"expectation\".

Similarly, \"the last straw\" (C) refers to an object that holds something else together, but the person in this scenario did not have one.\n\nThus the options that refer to something that a person can hold onto and not lose are ruled out from the question, giving us options \"end a line\" (D) and \"toy store\" (E).\n\nIt is reasonable that if Sally had lost her kite as a result of her carelessness and the kite was a toy; then Sally would probably have blamed that she lost it only because she went wrong at the end of the line; if the toy was from the toy store then she would probably be angry that it was lost since she had to go all the way to the the end of line to fetch it from toy store. \n\nThus the answer is E: toy store", "answer": "D: end of line"}

In this case, D (the price was too high) wouldn't be true. But the question does not explicitly state whether the price was too high (so we can eliminate this choice D).\n\nWe have 3 options left: A, B, and C.\nG (he got help from a friend) and I (he saved on expenses) do not seem to be possible (otherwise, H wouldn't be true), but I is contradicting B. So, A and B are out and leave us with only H.\n\nSo answer choices F (the price was too low), G (he got help from friend), H (prices were high), and I (he saved expenses) do not help us understand why the car manufacturer made millions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is H (the prices were too high), implying that the profits were derived from a price rise.\n\nInput: A: The sun sets in the west.

{"text": "Reason:This question has two answers; one related to alcoholism and the other related to the accident.\n\nThe scenario of the driver of the car being a drunkard is irrelevant, as it does not directly concern the type of place the person spent 8 years at.\n\"Prison\" (A) might be a reasonable answer if the driver's alcoholism were related to the accident.  But since alcoholism is not necessarily related to the accident, it can be ruled out.\n\"Homeless shelter\" (E) is possible but again, the accident is not related to the person's homelessness. Additionally, the sentence \"because of his mistake\" (E) suggests that \"the mistake\" refers to the accident and not alcoholism.\nTherefore, we are left with \"bridge\" (C) and \"neighbor's house\" (D).\nThe scenario about the bridge can also be read as a joke. While possible, it's an overly complicated interpretation of the sentence, which is not ideal.\n\nThe answer \"neighbor' house\" (D) is the only correct answer that fits both the alcoholism scenario and the accident scenario. If the driver were intoxicated during a driving accident, he would probably be held at a neighbor's house, either to avoid criminal charges or until the alcohol could leave his system. In the scenario's context, it makes all the sense in the world that the man ended up in a neighbor's home for eight years.\n\nSo the final answer in this case is D: neighbor's house.\nInstructions: Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\nInput:There was a murderer.

Choices:  a.  fever b. body c. blood d. core E. heart\nOutput: Answer:\n\nThe answer to this question is 'core body temperature' (E). \n\nThis answer can be deduced by noting that the context of the question is that the scientist is studying a patient's 'temperature', and that the term 'body temperature' is being used to refer to only the temperatures of the physical body. Thus, the answer should be something that is not restricted to the physical body.\n\nOption 'fever' (A) is incorrect, as it only refers to abnormally high temperatures. \n\nOption 'heart' (B), is also incorrect as it only refers to the human heart and not to a person's body. \n\nOption'body' (C) is incorrect as it refers to an individual's body, rather than their body temperature.\n\nOption 'blood' (D) is also incorrect, as blood is not considered to be integral to an individual's core body temperature. \n\nTherefore, the only remaining correct answer is 'core body temperature', making it the final answer.\n\nInput:The doctor in the emergency room called the patient's friend to inform that the patient is being transported to hospital Choices:  a: to b: with c", "answer": "A: sights"}

A better answer would be \"improved health\" (C) since it refers to the long-term benefits of regular exercise. \"Shin splints\" (D) is likely related to overuse of the legs when jogging, which could lead to health issues. Finally \"being tired\" (E) could be a result of jogging for extended periods of time or at an intense rate, which is not in keeping with the jogging definition I've outlined above.\n\nSo, the final answer is C: (to be) improved health\n\nInput:How do you find the length of a diagonal of a square? Choices:  a: you measure two sides and deduct the other two sides b: multiply one side by one side c: take half the perimeter d: do math e: you add the two sides\nOutput: Reason for Answer:\n\nThe concept of a \"square\" should help you narrow down the choices. The first two are obviously wrong since a square has four sides. \n\nThe options \"add\" (E) and \"do maths\" (C) refer to adding up the two lengths of a side. This, however, contradicts what we know about the definition of a square, and doesn't help us solve this problem.\n\nSo, we're left with \"multiply\" (A) and \"take the half of\" (D). It seems the two options mean the same thing. We can figure that out by looking at the diagram we were provided.\n\nThe length of each side is 10cm. The \"shortest\" or \"most direct\" connection between opposite corners of a square is its diagonal, and we were told that length of its diagonal is 30cm. It seems that the problem is asking us to calculate the length of the diagonal by using the \"Pyth", "answer": "C: improved health"}
{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nTo rule out the irrelevant option, \"economic instability\" (B).

So these options can be ruled out as well.\n\nThe only relevant option is \"spend more\" (B). When inflation is low, it's unlikely the government would have to spend more on subsidies to offset the cost.

Choices: \t A: walking B: taking the stairs C: a brisk walk up a hill D: running E: sit-ups and push-ups\nOutput:Reason:\nThe very first thing that stands out is that the options \"walking\" (A), \"taking the stairs\" (B) and a \"brisk walk up a hill\" (D) all require movement on the part of the individual.\n\nThe other option is \"sit-ups and push-us\" (E). It's unlikely this would be a viable way to get exercise because of the limited space. \n\nFinally, option \"sit-ups\" requires more explanation.

It is not possible for glass sheets of such a thin size to break easily unless they are subjected to significant force, which would be inconsistent with the nature of glass as a generally brittle material.\n\nFurthermore, \"shattering\" refers to the process in which a plate or panel breaks into many smaller pieces, while \"breaking\" refers to a single break across the entire surface. Therefore, \"shattering glass\" does not refer to break easily but rather break into pieces which is similar to D.\nNext, \"bend\" would require considerable force and is impractical as glass plates are meant to support their own weight, while \"hold water\" would be the characteristic of a water container, not glass plates. It doesn't answer \"What is the characteristic of thin glass?\"\n\n\"Break easily\" is the least correct option because it implies glass plates are very brittle and prone to breaking under moderate pressure, which is not the true nature or a thin glass plate.\n\n\"Melt\" is an option that refers to the glass sheet melting upon heating, which would not result in thin glass plates as it wouldn't be easy to shape or form.\n\nFinally \"better understanding\" is the correct answer given that there is no other characterstic, which means you need to dig a little deeper.\nSo the final outcome is E: Better Understanding. \n\n### Instruction:For questions 6 through 10, complete the table by selecting either A or B.\n\n6.

This seems obvious enough, as the option stated explicitly states that John liked being able to compete against others. We can eliminate D as well for the same reason, as it suggests John liked losing more over winning, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nThe next step is to determine the type of competition John had in mind. The remaining options each focus on different facets of competition, so it is important to consider what type of competition John likes the most. Does he value the skill of his opponents, or does he value himself as a competitor? Does he derive joy from winning, or from competing?\n\nThe best answer here is \"winners and losers\" (A), as this is consistent with John's character. He is very competitive, and he likes being able to compete with other athletes.  John doesn't want to compete so he can lose, he wants to compete so that he can win.

This points toward a relatively harsh stance against herself, indicating a degree of self-disparagement. We can eliminate options that don't fit the narrative as well. She doesn't like herself, and therefore doesn't like her friends (B), her enemies (C), her family (D), or her neighbors (E) either. So we can narrow the answer down to two options: she likes her enemies and she likes herself, which seem to be in competition with one another.\n\nSo we're left with three options:\n\nI.

{"text": "The correct answer is 'C' stress. Stress refers to our response to a situation, or our emotional state. When we are stressed, we become less capable of coping with various situations and making rational decisions, even when all the information is right in front of us. Therefore, someone feeling stressed won't be able to shop as clearly.\nAnswer choice (A) 'Happiness', does not make sense. Happiness requires being engaged or even enjoying, or at least not feeling distracted or irritable by the situation, which doesn't necessarily mean people can shop. It says the opposite, in fact; 'happiness' can allow people to spend more, but only after they have gained their emotional footing first. \nAnswer choice 'B' 'Lack of money' sounds somewhat plausible because if you feel you lack money, you would not buy things for yourself or others. But stress doesn't necessarily affect one's financial stand. Money doesn't ensure happiness, and you can be both stressed and rich, so this answer does not hold much weight. \nAnswer choice (E) 'Exhilaration' is not the same as being 'happy', and you don't always need 'exhilaration' to'shop'.\nAnswer choice (D)'relief' holds some weight.

Option (C) makes sense as a place a plant could be displayed.  While the question never explicitly states so, it also implies that one could place a ficus in a hair salon as a decoration.

While a cashier may want more space, their job is not primarily about room, but about supplies.\n\nOption (A) (\"money\") is too general, since not all problems require more money to solve them.\n\nThe only other option is \"credit\" (C).

While disorientation could result in injury or death under certain circumstances (for example, if the traveler's vehicle crashes), this seems like a stretch. There is no guarantee that disorientation would lead to a crash.\n\nOption \"due to\" (C) also isn't dangerous, because \"due to\" is a modifier for the preceding phrase: underwater traveling. A dangerous act underwater could be caused by something else, such as \"water depth\" (the first option). Therefore, this option is irrelevant.\n\nThe remaining options are both connected to the idea of \"underwater darkness\" or \"low visibility\".  Therefore, it is safe to assume that these options are referring to some form of injury or death. \n\nComparing the options, \"getting somewhere\" (E) is the only direct mention of injury or death, which suggests that it is the correct answer. \n\nSo the final answer choice is E: relocation", "answer": "A: disorientation"}

First of all, changing rules to play another game with them or changing rules with them doesn't make sense when you win another \"football\" or \"hackey\" game.\n\nAnother point for you to eliminate the options is: \"Change the location\" makes no sense especially in the answer that is \"in the world of sports\". And if you want to change the game, no one can stop you as it is usually \"play against\", this option just doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nAnd if not those options, the other options are just too vague.\nAnswer: A and E change the game to something new with different rules such as the baseball and hackey\nInput: Which of the following are examples of synonyms?

{"text": "Reasoned Out:\n\nHere we observe the phrase \"kick the bucket,\" which is quite ironic as \"bucket\" is not something that can kick back. Similarly, the term \"mortal\" carries the meaning of \"death\" but \"mortal\" is not the actual term used to describe a being that is death.\nNow, let's consider all the options one by one to deduce the correct answer:\n\n- A: Kick the bucket -  The phrase \"kick the buckets\" is a metaphor for death. So, this one is out.\n- B: Mortal -  It suggests that a \"mortal\" creature is able to die and so cannot be immortal. But this is not the answer, since a being that is immortal cannot die is the question.\n- C: Dead -  This can be eliminated due to the inclusion of the phrase \"lacking immortality\" in the question. Hence, the answer is not given here.\n- D: Can die - It is incorrect due to the fact that we are asked about a person who is lacking immortality and not those that are still left with immortality. So, this option is out of scope.\n- E: Dying - The option is out of the scope due to the fact that the question is looking for the answer about a creature who lacks immortality only.\n\nSo the final answer here is E:Ded.\nInput:Why do people say that \"The straw that broke the camel's back was the nail that was too short\"?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe key thing here is to identify options that make no sense. Option \"house\", for example, is obviously incorrect because white shoes don't go with houses.\n\nHowever, if the question is asking for places to wear white shoes, option \"D\" (left foot) isn't actually incorrect. It just provides a new context to the question. From that perspective, the options \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" (all wedding-based contexts) should be eliminated.\n\nAs for the option \"E\" (closed foot), it doesn't make any sense if you look at it from a general perspective.

The person who's asking the question may be talking about something that was lost or stolen. This is why option \"A\" (a lost pet) should be eliminating.\n\nAs for option \"C\" (an elephant), that can only be found in a zoo. It makes no sense if you look at the scenario from the context of someone having a lost pet. They wouldn't have an elephant when they lost their pet.\n\nBy the end, the questions should only be \"A\" (lost pet), or you are talking to a person with a lost pet.

As a noun, \"polish\" often refers to a smoothed, shiny gloss. One could interpret the reflection of a carved, cut, and polished piece of wood to indicate one has accomplished the task of designing and creating said wood piece.

Nowadays, a woman can go to work just as well as a man can. We also know that \"drink beer\" (E) is not on the list since he doesn't have to get ready. There is not enough information in this question to choose \"dress himself\" (D).\n\nThe answer is either \"Showers\" (b) or \"Drives train\" (c). Both options show a level of independence from the father. So we want to know if they prefer to shower themselves or drive the train by themselves (i.e. on the road to work).\n\nThe answer to the question comes when we think of the children's relationship with the father. We can infer that they probably use the father as a role model in terms of their work ethic and independence in general.\nIf \"Soon\" is considered, we can think of the father driving his children to work. But it's unlikely the father is the main driver of the boys. In this way, option C becomes the most likely choice.\n\nFinally, we find that the most likely choice is Dress himself.\n\nInput: If a girl is on a date and his parents are not home, then his parents are probably?

It's clear that it's facing the window - so it's in front of it.

If we look at the context and figure out the situation, we may decide that \"presence across the street\" is the most likely correct answer, and that \"presence at a friend's house\" (C) is too far-fetched.\n\nThe option \"friends' house\" (C) involves two distinct concepts that make no sense when looked at together: friends and houses. A person's presence at a friend's place is unlikely to elicit such a reaction from a dog. Another option, \"presence across the road\" (E), is similar in incorrectness to (E), but also involves the unnecessary concept of a \"place\" between the dog and the building. In contrast, the only correct answer combines the concept that the dog is barking at something it sees, which can be construed as a presence, while giving a clear indication of location with the phrase \"a presence at the window.\"\nSo the correct option is A: building\n\n# Task 3\n## A.

This is because it assumes that a single \"file\" is the only place we can keep a file.

It could be an urban area, but what is a \"business district\"? Wouldn't it make more sense to refer to a business district instead of an amusement park? Furthermore, what do you need to park your car for? Cars are a common product, so we can assume that you're heading for a different purpose. \n\nTherefore, Options C and D are the most likely. Both of them refer to something far away from where you currently are. However, these could still be options for other reasons.\n\nWhile Option C refers to the \"car business district\", it's unlikely that you'd be going there in these conditions - most people likely choose to visit car lots in more peaceful times. On the other hand, Option D refers primarily to an amusement park, which is where you're supposed to be heading.\n\nAdditionally, Option D is also a little more specific, mentioning that you're going to a \"carnival park\". This narrows down the options in an even more precise manner.

It may seem tempting to jump to choice C (middle ages), but we must look carefully at all the options. Choice A (fairy tale), though seemingly unlikely, could be valid. A child's fairy tale in the form of a storybook could feature a smaller knight on a smaller scale.\n\nThe same logic applies to choice B (castle). It could be possible that a smaller knight is present somewhere within the sprawling castle complex, albeit hidden away.\n\nThe answer to this question is actually another question - \"Where in a castle would we find a child?\" The answer is, of course, in a dollhouse.

In such a situation, the two competitors may get into an argument or debate, but they are unlikely to engage in a battle or to get into stress.  Option E seems like the most plausible, given the context.\n\nOption B however can be disregarded because stress in this situation wouldn't be caused by an argument between two people, but instead by the high-pressure context of the situation itself.\n\nOption C and D can also be ignored because an argument does not necessarily imply stress, while two people engaging in a debate over something does not necessarily come to blows. Similarly, stress does not necessarily lead to a debate or argument, but only to \"an increased mental and/or physical anxiety caused by a situation perceived as stressful.\"\n\nSo the final answer would be E: tension\n\nInput: The farmlands were in abundance for the locals.

This seems like a perfect situation for growing rice. They can also grow wheat and other crops like sugarcane.

Moreover, the continent's southern states can see temperatures reaching 30\u00b0C in the summer, which means that they are never covered in snow.\n\nCanada, on the other hand, experiences a fairly varied climate, ranging from the extremely cold North to the mild south. This means that although it is not impossible for Canada to have snow on its surface, such as during winter, it cannot be classified as \"always having snow\".\n\nAt the surface of the Earth, we do not always see snow \u2013 in fact, only about 10% of our planet's surface is covered in snow year-round.

Since it is not physically possible to place a light in the universe (which encompasses space and everything that exists within it), this eliminates choice C. Choice D (attic) is another improbable placement for a light, because attics are usually high up by the ceiling, and light fixtures are generally low down; therefore, lights are not typically placed in attics. \n\nThere is no mention in the question about a ceiling or ceiling fixture, so it is most likely not in the ceiling.

Choices:  a pimple B: a mole C: an eyelash D: a hair E: a zit\nOutput: Reason : \n\nThis question asks which of two objects is larger in size.\n\nOption A is the choice for the answer because it means \"blemish\" rather than\"a mole\". There are two definitions in the Oxford dictionary for \"mole\" but none pertain to the definition of a blemish. Therefore, this answer is the only logical one because it is one of the only two choices.\n\nWhile option B and D both describe moles, option B gives no further information so we don't know when it says \"a pimple\" whether it's referring to a small, blemish such as a pimple, or a large, flat area. That makes this a wrong answer.\n\nOption E also means \"blemish\" meaning they are one in the same.

Therefore, it is possible that Mary's behavior could be construed as \"cold\" or \"unwelcoming\".\nOn the other hand, option \"unfamiliar\" (B), implies that Mary does not know James, and therefore would likely be polite if they met. As such, this option is incorrect.\nOption \"unknown\" (C) carries an inherent negative connotation, as the word \"known\" implies. It refers to a person with whom a person has a good relationship or prior association, and could lead people to think that Mary doesn't know James at all, which will make them suspicious.\nThis leaves us with \"shy\" (D) and \"unacquainted\" (E) as accurate options.

It would even be possible for the person to have met an entire list of presidents other than the tenth, because the question isn't really asking which of those specific individuals are the tenth president. The person could have met the first president instead, or the most recent president.\n\nSo the person has met at least five past presidents, but doesn't say which. The options include all the presidents listed. It's fairly likely that the person met the tenth president, who isn't Lincoln or Kennedy - both are past presidents, so that list is ruled out.

A guilty conscience would make a person feel bad about what they have done.\n\nFear of punishment is not part of feeling guilty, but another response which usually follows feeling guilty. Therefore, for the question, conscience would feel guilty, not fear of punishment. Hence, our final answer is that for someone who has been caught in a murder, his/her conscience would be guilty, not fear of guilt.\n\nInput:Which of the following is true about the human body\u2019s immune system?

This option: It is highly efficient at keeping the body\u2019s systems clean. This option: Its efficiency decreases over time. This option: It cannot get stronger.\nOutput:Reasonings:\n\nThis option: It prevents every single new disease.\n\nTo know that human body\u2019s immunity cannot prevent every disease, I have to understand how immunity works. I understand that when we are born, we already have a set of antibodies that help us fight against illness, but these antibodies only prevent most people of getting affected with certain major diseases.

This option cannot be considered to be true because I do not have much information about the immunity.\n\nLet\u2019s look at which option: It always starts to work after contact with disease- invading pathogens.\n\nThis is not true about immunity because it takes time for the body to produce antibodies against a new disease. If a person has not encountered the disease in question before, their immunity would start to work much after the infection. The best bet would be the second option, which is, it is highly efficient at keeping body\u2019s system clean.\n\nHuman body has three types of barriers to prevent pathogens from entering the blood stream.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe given question assumes that a certain someone (e.g., spider) will be perceived as anything but human by the onlooker. So, any options that describe human characteristics (such as happy and strange) can be discounted.\n\nFrom there, the remaining options need to be considered in the context of this scenario. A \"scary\" person might be viewed as dangerous (C). But the choice of \"dangerous\" is too broad and doesn't convey a clear image of personality or character.\n\nThe right answer therefore, must convey some aspect of what it meant for people to fear this person. The word \"weird,\" while not denoting any concrete characteristics, conveys the sense of fear that this person elicits. People might not like what this person represents or the feeling that person induces, which makes option E the most accurate.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is E: weird\n\n\n\n\n### Instruction:The question has been divided into four segments.

Segment B (A - sub-segments) contains only one sub-segment (4), so this option can be quickly eliminated.\n\nSegment C (A - sub-segment) contains three sub-sub-segments: 1, 2 and 3. Therefore, this option is also eliminated.\n\nBecause segment C doesn't contain sub-sub-subseg", "answer": "C: dangerous"}

In other worlds, the sun is an obvious light source, so it's likely that the vintage, decorate light is something other than the sun.\n\n\"The sky\" (B) is also unlikely. According to the question, the light source is not in the sky, it is the sky itself. If the sky is a light source, it's in all likelihood not a \"vintage\" one.\n\nNext, we would eliminate \"the candle\" (C) because it's not logical to think the sun, or the sky, could be a vintage, deocrative light source. \n\nThe next option to be eliminated is \"the house\" (E), for similar reasons explained above. \n\nFinally, \"the lamp\" (D) is the correct answer.

'Dance' doesn't appear in the options. However, 'volleyball' does mention 'volley' which is the word before the 'D', hence 'V'. Same for 'baseball' which mentions 'base', also the clue is in these extra word, which are'sports'.\nSimilarly, since E says'sport' which is a sport, the key clues are'sport' and'science', so it should have the key letter 'O', so E.\nNow remaining options don't have the key, which is 'D', which is the only one which is left.

The use of the word \"welcome\" implies that the respondent is currently living a different state of life - in this case, they may be experiencing a depression, or are experiencing difficulty and struggle, but would like to experience a change.

The third option, D seems to be the right answer. However, they do not intend for that to be the case, but rather intend to achieve that state.\n\nSo D is out. What does that leave us with? Exactly that. B is the answer as the scientist thinks that the world can be perfectly organized. It is not a beautiful world or a fair one, but the one that he expects. He wants the world to be ordered according to their will. He thinks that if everything is organized according to their ways, then it will be perfect for them.", "answer": "B: welcome change"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe question invokes the image of \"a long day of traveling\" - which can be interpreted as a reference to air travel.\n\nOption \"sickness\" (A) seems like it could be the correct answer, as a common side-effect of air travel is motion sickness. However, it wouldn't make logical sense if the traveler is going to sleep immediately following a plane ride - what you would expect from flight sickness. This is why that's not the correct option.\n\nNext, we need to narrow down the number of answer choices. \nOption \"motion sickness\" (B) would make logical sense if the situation described is air travel, but it's not, according to context provided in the question. The correct answer is therefore eliminated.\n\nFurther,  option \"jet lag\" (D) is also eliminated from possibility of being right.  No matter what time zone the traveler is moving from, they will still feel tired after a long day of air travel - this is not an answer that the question wants to see.\n\nTherefore, option \"fatigue\" (E) is the last option to be considered, as it can be deduced to be the correct answer based on the context of the question: long day of air travel = tired.\nSo the final option is E: fatigue\n\nInput: What's something that an average baby would not likely be able to do?

If it could be assumed that babies are capable of learning anything at an early age, there's no way to determine if they can swim or not.

That immediately eliminates possibilities that involve action on a room level, such as B and C, as well as options on the apartment level, such as D and E.\n\nThe next task, then, is to determine the scale and directionality of the action. While option \"a rooftop\" (A) may be physically achievable, it is uncommon to place anything on the rooftop of a building. In addition, a rooftop is a location, not something that is used to support furniture. This would suggest that the correct option is one that incorporates both the verb \"put\" and the object \"on top of.\"\n\nNext, the person might be putting something \"on top of\" furniture, so we can eliminate options that describe action occurring \"on\" the furniture, such as \"on a couch\" (B) and so on.\n\nThe remaining options are then narrowed down to those that involve furniture as the object being \"put on\" top of something.

For example they dance. they sing. they act on a stage.\nNow, we know what a performer is, where do they perform? We can look at the other choices and answer that out. For example, Arena and Sports stadium, they perform where they get the highest viewership, and also in concert halls, where the performance can be heard with the least of interference.\n\nSo option D Concert hall would be the correct answer.\n    \nInput:What is the relationship between a \"base\" and an \"item\"?

This would be like if we used the term top, bottom, bottom, top. The items change but the order of things doesn't.\n\nThen, we look at each option and make an inference as to their answer from that.\n\nSo option A would be wrong because a base is not an item.\n\nThen option B would be wrong because a word is opposite of a word if the first few letters are the opposite. Like a \"base\" and \"item\" are the opposite of \"base\" and \"base\" respectively.\n\nThen option C would be wrong because if an \"item\" \"is the\" opposite of a \"base\" then it is the opposite of a base item. If an item item, then that item would be \"item\" base, or in our original terms, base bottom, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a base would be an item and its item but its not that way the opposite of what you would expect.\n\nOption E is incorrect because there is not even really a word such as \"base\". \"Base\" has been used multiple times. We know this word cannot be an item since it is a word.\n\nThis leaves us to answer the answer we originally", "answer": "A: arena"}

It doesn't - think about it!\n\nThe answer is correct in that \"budgeting\" (C) refers to financial planning. However, budgeting is a broad term that encompasses planning money allocations to save and spend on expenses, not just expenses. \n\nSo, you can eliminate the choice \"on expenses\" (D), that doesn't cover everything that falls under the category of budgeting.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nOnce again, understanding the context is the first step. Here, the options describe what type of commemoration the artist is creating. The first option is \"triple crown\" (E), a famous and significant race in the United States that takes place once per year, and is notorious for not being easily won. Therefore, option (E), which can be seen as a form of \"commemoration,\" is not a type of commemoration, so it must be ruled out.\n\nThe second option is \"painting.\" This also is not a particular commemoration, but rather a type of artistic representation of a horse or event. Also \"racetrack,\" which represents a place that is used to race horses, can also be seen as a form or representation of a horse. However, a commemoration is always a specific memorial in honor of a particular person or event, so this too must be ruled out. \n\nThis leaves us with three remaining options. The most likely (in my opinion and experience) would be \"hoof\" (B), which refers specifically to a part of the horse's anatomy and is therefore a specific commemoration. But it is also unlikely, since the options also describe commemorations related to horse racing, and a horseshoe is not a part of a horse's anatomical, biological makeup.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is: hoof \n\nInput: I am thinking \nChoices:  A: of all \nOutput: Answer:\n\nNow to some math:\n\n- This question should be considered as an algebraic equation.\n- The answer is:\n\n- 1-x=1-x because that is the equation stated.\n-\n-\n\nInput:Their eyes met.

In this scenario, it makes sense that he is looking for cotton balls because he needs them for some sort of craft project.\n\nOption \"south\" (A) is more plausible than the other options because cotton is a type of plant that is commonly found in more southern parts of the United States. Georgia is located in the southern part of the U.S., but north Carolina cannot be ruled out either because it is located in the southern region of the country.\n\nThe option \"north carolina\" (C) is inaccurate because it implies that the man is searching for cotton farms in northern Carolina, which is actually located in the southern part, not the north part.\n\nThe option for the man to look inside his \"medicine cabinet\" (E), while it might seem plausible, would be to look into getting medicine or other supplies from the cabinet, not cotton balls to complete a craft project.\n\nThe last option is for the man to look somewhere in the \"pocket\" (B). It would be unlikely for the man to have cotton balls in his pocket, as one would probably assume that cotton balls were used for home projects, not for immediate everyday items that would be carried in pockets.\n\nSo the correct answer is A: south\n\nInput:Which month has the most birthdays?

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nAgain, the initial task is to understand the literal context. Here, the newborn's eyes are opening for the first time, so they haven't seen anything before this moment. So, the option \"see light\" (B) (since light is commonly referred to as \"seeing\" something) must be incorrect. This is because the opening of one's eyes happens long before they \"see\" physical forms such as light. Therefore, it would be impossible for a newborn to see light for the first time at the beginning of a lifetime.\n\nNext, the task is to determine what the eyes do for the first time ever. The choice \"fill with tears\" (C) doesn't make logical sense, because newborns haven't produced tears during the first few months of their life. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.\n\nThe choice \"tie up\" (A) is incorrect because eyes cannot physically be tied up or bound by anything. \n\nThe choice \"glass over\" (D), while correct in nature, doesn'tactually mean what a newborn's eye's eyes \"become\" (a euphemism) at birth. Although it is impossible for a newborn's first time to be seeing light, it is not impossible for a newborn whose eye's were closed to look \"glass-like\" or blank; this meaning aligns better with the word \"glass\" in this context. The final answer is therefore C: fill with tears\n\nInput: What is used for making candy apples?

{"text": "Reason: Here there is a pun involved which i assume is bread + bill = bread roll.\n\nThe question presents a play on words, namely \"bill with bread\" - which is also called a \"bread roll.\" Therefore, \"restaurant\" (B) and the other options which explicitly mention bills or the dollar sign (C, D, and E) cannot be used since they do not match the given context.\n\nOnly the final option remains, \"Envelope\" (A). It matches the context and describes a place where bills are typically found -- a simple and logical answer to choose.\nSo in this question the answer is A: Envelope\n\nInput: Which has more fish: a bucket of water or an aquarium? Choices:  bucket B aquarium C: bag D: ocean E: bowl\nOutput: Reason : The answer to this question is:\n\nThe question is about a fish tank and a bucket of water (or sea water). The options suggest that a bucket of water has more fish than an aquarium.\n\nIf you remember the basic concepts of ocean biomass, you would recall that there are approximately 230 000 000 tons of the biomass of fish in the world's oceans. So clearly the ocean has the most fish!\n\nSo the Final answer is E: Ocean\n\nInput: Which of these is not an animal?

{"text": "Reasoning:\nThe first step in determining the correct answer is to break down the word \"eat.\"\n\nIn order to \"eat fruit,\" it requires ingestion - which is why options that don't mention inhaling, smelling, or swallowing are ruled out (like options A and B).\n\nNext, we need to understand what a red bridge is - is it on a body of water? is it next to a restaurant?\nIt turns out that the red bridge in this question is the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge (which is, indeed, red).\n\nWhen you cross a bridge, you are crossing a body of water, and, given the question, it would be reasonable to consider the option \"eat any fruit on the bridge.\" This option has the distinct advantage of being more straightforward than that of \"eating the fruit on refrigerator,\" which is not a \"fruit\" at all.\n\nFinally - we can eliminate option D - we know it isn't on the refrigerator; we know from the bridge that it is on the ground. It does not reside on a tree.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: eat any fruit on the bridge\n\nInput:If you want to see the king, where would you go? Choices:  i. on the road to the castle ii. on the road to her castle\nOutput:Reasoning\n\nThis question can be broken up into two halves:\nWhere should you go IF....\nWhat will happen THEN...\n\nSo, we need to ask ourselves - where should go TO \"see the king.\" We won't see the king by going to \"her castle.\"\n\nAlso - on the road \"to the castle,\" we must be on the road to \"see\" the king. If we are on the road \"to\" the castle, we are merely *intended* to see the king, but not *actually* intended to have a direct encounter with him.\n\nSo, we can eliminate options (ii) because it contradicts option (i) - it simply isn't \"on the road to the castle\" that we see the king - and it is on the road to the king in which we encounter him.\n\nSo that leaves us with option (i): we would \"see\" the king \"on the road to her castle.\"\n\n\nInput", "answer": "C: san francisco"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nIn this question, we're looking for a word that describes why people laugh or feel happy, when it's unexpected.\nThe most common answer would be \"laughter\", but it's important to look beyond the literal meaning of the word. While laughter is certainly one way that people express surprise or humor, it isn't specific to the point where the laughter arises from an unexpected or comical situation. Therefore, this answer could be eliminated.\n\nThe next answer \"frightened\" (D) could be reasonable if the question were asking about what makes people happy when it's unexpected and scary. If that were the scenario, then \"frightened\" would be a viable answer choice. However, the question doesn't make mention of \"scary\" or \"feeling frightened\", so eliminating this answer choice is appropriate as well.\n\nThe next possible answer is from the phrase \"fight for\". But if it is a question about \"what makes people happy when it\u2019s surprising and unexpected\", than it's unlikely they would be \"fight[ing] for\" anything. It would be unlikely to find someone \"fight[ing for] laughter\".\n\nLastly, answer B: humor is the correct answer as it is often a surprise and is unexpected.", "answer": "B: humor"}

D: she should leave when she's at the top of her performance 5. E: she probably didn't enjoy at all\nOutput:Reason:\n\nThe reason for why the woman's game lost the entire money was because she tried to win the competition to earn more money.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first thing to understand is what kind of \"what.\" It's either a noun or a non-count noun, meaning that its spelled with a singular form. In this case, it's a non-count n noun, meaning we'll need a singular form. This makes our options limited to \"a headache\" (A), \"a fatigue\" (B), \"a relaxation\" (C), and \"an overeating\" (D).\n\nNext, to determine which of these options is correct, you need to be able to describe what headaches, fatigue, and relaxation all mean. A headache (A) is pain or discomfort in the head, often accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or light sensitivity. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, tension, food allergies, or underlying medical conditions. A fatigue (B), or tiredness, is a feeling of physical and mental exhaustion. It can be caused my a variety of factors, such as lack of sleep, overwork, depression, or underlying medical conditions like anemia or hypothyroidism. A relaxation (C) is a state of calm, peace, and tranquility, usually brought on by soaking in a bathtub, going on vacation, or having a cup of tea. And finally, an overeating (D) is when a person consumes too much of a type of food, usually leading to weight gain and other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.\nOnce you know what these different words mean, it's easier to identify what the correct answer is.

You won't find the phrase \"dark and stormy night\" mentioned in writing, although you may sometimes find reference to things related to it, like the \"The Dark and Stormy\" drink at a restaurant or \"the Stormy Weather\" song.\n\nThe correct answer is D (which is the only answer that isn't a clunky phrase).\n\nInput:If I could only have one beer, which would you recommend I buy?

And the option \"pure\" (D) is also wrong because the person is definitely not pure.\n\nThat leaves option \"evil\" (E), the most apt description of what the judge did. The judge clearly thinks that the convicted murderer is evil. So the final answer would be \"E: He told the guilty murdere he is evil.\"\n\n## 3. Why should we always follow the instructions given in the problem?\nI was not asked for answer, but rather to read the passage given at the bottom of the page.\nWhat I understood after reading the passage is in the world of job interviews, there is some expectation from the employer that the candidate will know how to take a clue and solve the given problem, not just to spuriously provide the answer(s) he/she find on the internet that suits his answer.\n\nThe first one may also be considered as a test to see how candidate will react, if the problem given in the interview does not make any sense he/she will simply find it bizarre, even ridiculous, not know how to react and just stare at the interviewer without any expression in his face.\n\nBut if the answer is obvious to him that the problem is banal, he/she can then be confident and provide a simple answer, which he/she would have no problem defending by making simple analogies to help the interviewer understand better.\n## 4. It was not so long ago, that some of the first mathematicians made a very big discovery about shapes and numbers.\nI was not asked a question.\nIf they made a discovery about shape and numbers.\nthen to solve a problem of shape and numbers, the candidate should try finding a mathematical or geometric solution to the problem.", "answer": "E: evil"}

Options B, C, and D are things you can put on a toast that are edible. The choice E is a possible food for a toast, but it is a completely separate option - it is the thing you put on the toast, not the toast itself.

However, it's the incorrect option.\nOption \"deny\" (B) can be correct if there was some type of disagreement between the applicant and their reference, but is also an incorrect answer.\n\nOf the remaining responses, the only plausible option is \"contradict\" (D).

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first part of the question is to determine where a microphone boom is likely to be covering a given event. This information can be inferred from the phrasing of the question.\n\nA microphone boom would be a tall, cylindrical device that can be attached to a microphone, increasing its pickup range.\nIt can cover a wide range of events, from concerts and TV studios to sports games and recording sessions. \n\nWhile it is certainly possible to cover a stock market event with a microphone boom (e.g., to interview the market commentator), the location is highly specific due to the context of the event. Here, it's mentioned \"stock market event\". This event can't be any given event since stock market events take place in specific locations, such as New York or other stock exchanges around the world.\n\nThis leads to option B: new york, as a correct answer.\nInput: You recently purchased a pink sweater at the supermarket.

Choices:  Layers of filling sandwiched between bread A. B. C. D. E.\nOutput: The first task is to understand what a sandwich can be, in the context of the question being asked. We know that a sandwich is a type of food that consists of two (or more) slices of bread with a layer of fillings in between.\n\nFor the first answer, we can see that sandwiches can be made with layers of filling sandwiched in between the bread. Examples of this include peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, club sandwiches, and grilled cheese sandwiches. These types of sandwiches use \"layers of filling sandwiched within bread\", therefore option A is the correct answer.\n\nThe second answer is a sandwich, which is a simple, traditional sandwich with a single layer of filling. These can be made by \"spreading ingredients", "answer": "A: new york"}

{"text": "Reasoned Out:\n\nSports stadiums and movie theaters typically have fixed seating, so they wouldn\u2019t be considered bleachers.\n\nGiven Bleachers is a song by John Denver, it would make sense for this question to refer to an outdoor venue, like a baseball stadium, a grassy field, or a stadium for sports. But an opera house may also be considered a theater, so that could fit in as an answer.\n\nSince a lecture hall and theatre aren\u2019t outdoor venues, I would eliminate those answers.\n\nThis leaves the answers A or D, which are essentially two options for the same place: stadiums. However, A specifies where you can \u201csit down\u201d, and I don\u2019t see too many bleachers where audience members can sit down.

While aerobics can be tough on the joints, it poses no more of a concern than walking.\nYoga is the best possible choice for an individual with artritis, it helps you with flexibility and also strengthen your muscles. This is a very suitable type of exercise for a person with any form of joint problems. In case walking seems monotonous and boring to you, you should switch to yoga in order to get the required physical exercises at your home itself.\n\nSo the final  answers are A: yoga  B: walking   C: bodybuilding D: aerobics", "answer": "E: hockey game"}

For simplicity, we will assume that 'Beauty' and 'Beast' are the only two possible answers.

We can assume so but we are more careful as we don't want to guess.\n\nThe father of the beautiful is more likely to be the killer in the story.\n\nThe Monster does not come under the possibilities as it is the 'Beauty' who is going to kill the monsters.\n\nAnswers (B D & E): We can eliminate them as it is given in the question that 'She and her father are to kill the monster', so it is unlikely to have a monster killing another monster.\n\nAns A is correct.", "answer": "A: beast"}
{"text": "Reason:\nThis is another example of an elimination method. Similar to the previous example, the question is focused on identifying an obvious answer that stands out from the rest.\nThe option \"airport\" (A), seems incorrect because a telephone booth would not be likely at an airport. It's a non-traditional solution that's not commonly found at airports.\n\nOption \"city\" (D) isn't applicable because the question asked specifically about a phone booth being red, not just any type of place.\n\nThe option \"gas stations\" (E), seems a lot more plausible as the place to find a red phone booth. You could argue that there may be more than one of the four choices. But remember that there must be an option that stands out as notably different than the others. Using the elimination method, we can eliminate the other possibilities, and so end up with the logical and proper answer: \"gas station\" (E).\n\nInput:  Can someone explain me how I can make the below image work for a tshirt design?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nOption \"injury\" (A) makes little sense in this context. Haircuts aren't inherently dangerous, so it is unlikely that cutting hair for longer than expected would cause an accident or get someone hurt.\n\nOption \"beauty\" (B) is a possibility, but it's unlikely that an extended haircut would have that much affect on the entire hairstyle. For example, say someone had long hair and got the haircut, and by the time they leave they are left with bangs. That is not enough to radically change their appearance. \n\nOption \"late\" (C) is also a possibility, but it doesn't fit the context either. The customer may not be late if the haircut takes too long, but they are still looking at the clock, which suggests that the next available slot is already taken. If it was simply a late haircut, they are more likely to wait for the next appointment since they don't yet have to worry about inconvenient.\n\nOption \"annoyed\" (D) is the only option that fits the context.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nAt first glance, there seems to be a variety of different locations to find trash cans in the city. But the phrase \"a trash can\" clearly indicates that a singular trash can is being sought after, and the options \"corner\" (C), \"bus stop\" (D), and \"store front\" (E) are all irrelevant because they are locations with multiple trash cans.\n\nIt's possible that this trash can could be at a park (A), but then two other options - a motel and a corner - would be listed as wrong answers. Therefore, these don't need to be weeded out since they're already excluded.\n\nThe last option is \"typically,\" which is essential to the question and needs to be accounted for. But if you're asked \"where\" (without \"typically\"), you'd logically assume that a blank means any location or multiple locations. Therefore, \"park\" (A) is out because it is the only \"typical\" answer listed.\n\nBut this leaves us with one remaining option: \"motel.\" The phrase \"a trash bin\" implies that only a single trash bin is being sought after. While a trash bin could potentially be found in the city at a bus stop, corner, or a variety of different locations, a motel is specifically listed as an option - and it happens to be correct! Thus, motel is the most likely answer and also the correct one.\nSo the final choice is motel\n\nInput: what is the smallest unit in mathematics of measurement?

Atomic size is a physical, not mathematical, characteristic of an element (A), so it is irrelevant to this question. A number may be the smallest, but in mathematics, a number is not a unit of measurement (C); it is merely a value on a scale. A distance (D) is also not a unit of measurement, at least in the context of this question. This leaves distillation (E) and proportion (B) as the only possible correct answers.\n\nThe next step is to identify the correct answer. Distillation", "answer": "C: corner"}

There is no reference to people reading in the scenario, and the scenario is about electronics (or, more specifically, phones and mobile devices), so option A cannot be the best answer.\nOptions B and D (passenger and fly), both of which mean \"use the plane for travel,\" are also irrelevant, because the scenario is about flight.\n\nThe scenario itself says that people cannot use electronics, so any options involving that activity cannot be the answer.\n\nFinally we are left with options C (land plane) and E (buy tickets). Option C is the only answer that can be a potential answer among the four remaining options. It is both accurate in terms of the content of the scenario and relevant to the scenario, in that it involves the actual flying process and the use of the planes themselves. Moreover, an airplane cannot land itself without the aid of the pilot flying the plane, meaning option C is the most likely outcome people would do to pass time on a flight.\n\n\n\n### Note\n\nI guess there'll be a lot of such questions where all you do is eliminate irrelevant options\n\nAlso you can just guess, it'll work fine, don't get too hung up on this", "answer": "A: read"}

Choices:  The government A. The telephone company B. His wife C. His friends D. His sister\nOutput:Reason:\nThe word \"jealous\" in this case means \"to be envious or resentful of the success or good fortune of another.\" From the context of the sentence, it's obvious that the inventor isn't jealous of his achievements. Instead, the inventor doesn't want people to steal his ideas, \"which he didn\u2019t want them to do, because he was jealous, not of their successes or of their talents, but of their minds.\"\n\nInput:Who doesn't like to cook?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step in answering this question is to identify the concept that is being measured in the question. We want to know how \"moving cars\" can be quantified or measured. One possible interpretation of this data could be the number of cars in a certain area at a given time. However, it's unclear exactly how this information is being collected, so we can't use this approach to determine the answer.\n\nAnother possibility is that the data relates to the movement of cars, which could mean how many cars are travelling in a given direction or when a car comes to a stop.\n\nUltimately, the question asks what \"moving cars\" entail, so we have to consider all possible answers for the word \"moving.\" Answer C, \"getting tired\" is not a valid choice because it describes a different subject than the word \"moving,\" and answer E, \"ticket\" is not a valid answer because it describes a different characteristic of moving cars. We're left with answers A, B, and D as options.\nAnswer A, \"driving,\" could refer to the activity of driving, such as how long someone was driving or how many times they made a certain manoeuvre. However, this is not a valid option, because it's possible for people to drive without moving at all. Answer D, \"accidents,\" could relate to the danger of moving cars, such as collision statistics or the number of injured drivers. However, this also does not work because it describes a specific event rather than the activity of moving.\n\nThe only remaining valid option then is answer B, \"road.\" This describes the geographical path taken by cars when they move, so it matches the original question and meets our answer criteria.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step in determining the correct answer is to understand the context in which the question is asked. In this case, the scenario involves a student who has mislaid her binder in her house. This implies that it is either in a specific location such as \"backpack\" (A), \"classroom\" (E), or \"office supply store\" (D).\n\nOption \"office\" excludes any possibility of the binder being in the student's office or backpack, eliminating it from the choices.\n\nOption \"bookcase\" (C) and \"classroom\" (D) exclude the possibility of the binder to be in the student's backpack, removing them as the options.\n\nFinally option \"backpack\" (E) could be a potential answer but \"classroom\" should be the correct answer as the word \"binders\" should be found at a place that the question refers to and this is excluded as an option as \"Bookcase\" is excluded.\nSo the final option is \"Class Room\"\n\nInput:You are a chef hired to prepare a wedding dinner. You have been asked to make a tasty pasta dish for the bride's table. Choices:  A. Stuffed mushrooms B. Stuffed shells C. Spinach dip D. Ravioli E. Lasagna\nOutput: Reason Choices:  A, E, C, B, F,D\n\nThe first step is to understand the question.\n\nThe goal of this scenario is to create a wedding dinner, and the chef may be hired to do so.\nHe is hired to serve lasagna at the bride's special table (e), so the bride and her guests should all have access to it as a side dish (or main dish, depending where and when this wedding takes place).\n\nSince the dinnertime will take place after dusk when it is dark outside (f), this leaves (d) as the only answer option that could be served as lasagna for the bride'sfamous pasta meal.\n\nFrom here we can simply eliminate any options not needed by the bride, and move on by finding more answers needed by her party guests!\n\nInput:You want to travel to Washington DC for Thanksgiving but you can afford", "answer": "E: class room"}
{"text": "Reasonability:\n\nThis question is tricky because it asks about what \"you are usually looking at,\" rather than asking specifically about what that object actually is. This makes it necessary to consider the context and intent of the question.\n\nIf someone were to ask you if you're usually looking at a plane, they might expect you to say \"no,\" since planes are typically visible during the daytime. This eliminates options A and C. If someone asked you about a concert, they might anticipate you to say \"yes,\" but concerts at night are usually not as common as those during the day. This eliminates option B. Option D is a possibility if someone asked about penguins in general or were talking specifically about an Antarctic expedition, but would be inappropriate if you had no context in regard to where and when the question was asked.\n\nThus, option E would be incorrect.\n\nThe most logical answer is A:carnival, since the blinking lights at night are probably at carnival shows, which are a common occurrence, and for which people typically attend at night rather than day.\n\nInput: In my spare time I like to write poetry. Which of the following is the purpose of poetry? Choices:  P: to tell a tale B: to describe life C: to convey emotions D: to share feelings E: to educate others\nOutput: Reason:\n\nAlthough option \"B\" (describe life) can sometimes be used to describe poetry, the correct answer is \"D,\" since this is the primary purpose of poetry.

Since Sarah has presumably been home all evening, she would not be able to leave for a daytime excursion.\n\nLet's examine option A (early morning). The scenario suggests a time when Sarah leaves her home. Therefore, \"early morning\" wouldn't apply, because it is a time when she would be at home.\n\nOption E is the answer because the only time for Sarah to leave would be in the night when she is at home.\n\nSo if we connect all the dots above, the following is our reasoning:\n\n   1) The question says that Sarah thought she had been at home all evening.  \n   2) Therefore, Sarah would have been at home all times other than a night excursion.\n   3) Therefore, the only time to leave would be during a night when she is at her home.\n   4) We've reasoned that the only time to for Sarah to leave her home is at the night. \n   5) Therefore, Early morning is the correct choice.\n\nSo, the final answer is A: early morning", "answer": "A: early morning"}

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nThis question is a type of trick question known as a \"reverse question\". A \"reverse question\" is a question that is worded in a way that seems to suggest one answer, but actually refers to another answer.\n\nFor example, what would be expected from a competent student when it comes to their school work? Option B, \"passing grade\", may seem like the obvious answer; after all, a competent student would want to get a good grade, would they not?\nHowever, the phrase \"passing grade\" refers to a lower expectation, as a passing grade is considered the minimum requirement for passing a course. As such, it doesn't make sense to expect a passing grade from someone who is competent in their schoolwork.\n\nThe other answer choices - A, B, C, and D - all refer to higher expectations (at least in the context of a school setting).\nWhile it's not wrong to expect any of these outcomes, a person who is truly competent in their school subjects would have a higher bar.\nThat's why the correct answer is D: avoid pain.\n\nInput: What is the advantage of the \"for\" loop in a language such as Python? Choices:  Anwer A: It allows you to execute code multiple times without needing to use a while loop. B: It allows you to break from an iteration. C: It can be used for control flow. D: It allows you to easily create lists. E: It allows you to handle the end of an iteration.\nOutput: Reason: Since a for loop in a language can execute a block of code more than once, the answer A is correct.\n\nInput: Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using parallel computing systems? Choices: 1: Performance 2: Redundancy 3: Efficiency 4: Cost-effective 5: Resilience\nOutput: Reason\n\nA parallel computing system means the computer system has two or more CPUs, and it can process more complicated instructions more quickly as the CPUs work simultaneously.\n\nSome advantages of parallel computing include improved performance, resilience, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. It is common to think of \"redundancy\" as a measure of resilience, but redundancy in this context refers to having multiple copies of important data or information.

The study probably has something to do with birth control, which would provide some insight into what the study might be.\n\nComparing that to the given context about searching for birth control pills in an examination of toothpaste, we can see that this would make the most sense.\nThe phrase \"next to the dentist\"?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nOption A, residential neighborhood:\nIn the question, the context is a parent explaining to their child why a school is important. In the residential neighborhood, a parent can enroll their child in a school. But this doesn't make sense, because students aren't allowed to enroll in a school (unless they're already attending a school), until it's located in their neighborhood.\n\nOption B, mosque:\nIn the question context, a school is explained to be located in various places, including a mosque. It's not clear whether the author is trying to explain the religious context of schools, or the location for a school. \n\nOption C, every city:\nThis is a confusing option to interpret. In order for a child to find a school in every city, they have to be enrolled in multiple schools. There's a possibility that they can move around the world, taking their school everywhere with them. However, this is not realistic for a child that may be homeschooled. \n\nOption D, prague:\nThis doesn't fit the context of a parent explaining to their children why school is important. Prague is a world-renowned city in the Czech Republic, and is most likely the child's hometown (if they're of Czech nationality).\n\nBy dismissed Option A & B, the remaining options are A, C, D and E.\nThough, E doesn\u2019t make sense. \"Community\" isn't an actual location. The other options (C,D,E) all refer to locations of schools across the world. The question is asking about the school's location.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nFirst, decide which option is most relevant to the context. \nThere is a reason for the query, a person is looking for a specific place to buy a notebook.  The options offered here would be unlikely to be a person's first suggestion, especially \"classroom\" (E).  There's no need to find a location where notebooks are for sale - there is almost certainly a local store nearby.\n\nNext, ask which of the other options most closely relate to where notebooks are actually purchased.  The answer that best correlates to the context is \"bookstore.\"  Not only is it a typical place where one would buy a notebook, but it also represents the closest option that actually fits the criteria. \n\nThe final task is to assess how well each of the other answer choices fit the context.  The other options do not hold water when held up against \"bookstore\" (A). \n\nA person is likely looking to purchase a notebook, so the option \"abraham lincoln's Grave\" (D) doesn't fit the context, no one goes to a grave looking to buy something.\n\nThe option \"desk top\" (B) is also incorrect.

The word \"penultimate\" (E) is defined as \"second to the last\" or \"next to last\".\n\nThe next step is determining how the choices are being applied. Choice \"flown\" (B) is a noun that refers to money, so \"what has happened to a person\u2019s money after she has used the last if it?\" would be logical. Choice \"dissipate\" (A) is a verb that refers to the dispersal of something, so \"what has dissipate after a person has used the last of money?\" would be appropriate.\n\nThat leaves us with choices \"fall apart\", \"disintegrate\", and \"penultimate\". \n\nChoice \"fall apart\" (D) is used when something falls and breaks apart; however, \"she has used her last bit of money\", meaning \"all of it\". Therefore, this isn't a possibility.\n\nChoices \"disintegrate\" (C) and \"penultimate\" are both adjectives that describe something. Therefore, \"what has disintegrated?\" or \"what has penultimated?\" would also be logical.\nBased on the context of the sentence, however, the word \"penultimate\", which is used to replace something that has been used up, would be the most applicable choice.  \n\nSo the result is E: penultimate", "answer": "A: dissipate"}

Option \"care for people\" (E) seems to answer the question directly, stating what god wants people to do with money. However, option \"ideal\" (D) would be the ideal choice.

Choices: \tA: no B: yes\nOutput: Reason for the answe:Reason:\n\nThis answer is vague and could be answered in a variety of different ways. The question does not mention whether this is a personal preference, or whether it's a requirement for this particular situation. It is unclear if the word \"no\" excludes an eulogy, or if it means that god doesn't want a eulogy at all.

{"text": "Reason: This question also requires contextual analysis. The options are all related to civil action, meaning a court case. The choices here are B) confusion, C) hurt feelings, and D) sandwiches.\n\n\"Confusion\" (B) can be eliminated as it is an undefined term with no connection to civil action. The wording \"instituting civil action\" refers to some type of dispute settlement, and it therefore doesn't make sense to expect confusion as a consequence of this.\n\nThen, when we evaluate the remaining choices the question becomes even more confusing. While civil action can potentially produce feelings of hurt, it is more closely related to legal disputes than social affairs. Therefore, the answer would have to be B) confusion\n\nSo the final answer for this question is B: confusion.\n\nInput:Why do we find 1? Choice: A: because it is easy B: because it is the square of 0 C: because it is the only number Choice: D: because it is special Choice: E: none of these\nOutput: Reason.\n\nIn this case the best strategy would be to focus on the question of why we need to know the answer. A mathematician is likely to say it's for \"special\" reasons (D), while a casual passer-by in a coffee shop would likely give you reasons A, B, or C.\n\nThe wording \"find\" (which here refers to \"know\") and \"special\" make it obvious that \"special\" reasons are best. \"Because it is easy\" (A) and \"the square of 0\" (B) can both be eliminated for being insufficient for \"special\" reasons.\n\nThen after the remaining choices are considered, we can eliminate \"because it is only number\" (C) for being too vague.

Additionally, \"fall asleep\" (A) seems difficult due to its conflicting nature with the act of listening to opera in a public setting. The answer \"boredom\" (C) is excluded because the phrase \"go to the opera\" could indicate that the author sees the experience as enjoyable, so it is unlikely that he would choose this answer if he felt that way.\nThe only remaining answer, therefore, is \"relaxation\" which fits perfectly as a response to a question about a common experience shared by opera attendees.", "answer": "D: relaxation"}

This only matters when the interest rate is 2.1% or 5%. We first take 2.1% because it is closer to one.\n \nBecause 2.1% is included in the interest, it affects time rate of interest. \nWe then look for the one with 2.1% and the difference in values for T.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe key to answering this question lies in understanding the wording of the prompt. The word \"even\" in the first line implies that the collector items are not included in the category of items the scientist has acquired. The second sentence further narrows down the focus to what the scientist has sold over the weekend, which implies that these items may be his recent acquisitions or new items.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the items sold can't be considered collector's items.

Next, identify which is possible for mice to do to see if it matches any of the remaining options.\n\nThe only matching option is E: eat a cheeseburger. However, this does not provide an example of what happened to the mouse because the mouse in the scenario was unable to complete a task: running a sprint or catching a flea.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the riddle is E: escape the enclosure.\n\nInput:The farmer had a very old goat called \u201cPeachy\u201d who was no longer productive and was a liability on the farm\u2019s operation.

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nTo find the answer, it is useful to identify the context of the question and what is being asked of the person. In this scenario, the person is alone and wounded, so it is clear that he needs to find help to treat his injuries.\n\nThe options could then be narrowed down by considering practicality and plausibility. Since being charming would likely not help a person treat a serious wound, crossing the street is eliminated. The last option, \"doctor himself,\" isn't a plausible answer either - though he might be able to treat minor ailments, he would likely not be qualified to perform surgical procedures on himself.\n\nIt is here that the option \"visit relatives\" (B) stands out - it fits both the practicality of the scenario and the concept of family support and care. The person is not able to take immediate care themselves, so reaching out to someone else for assistance makes sense. This would be the answer to the question.

The resturant in the question could be any restaurant but it is most likely an indian restaurant or food.\nHowever, we remove the resturant \"on top of the seattle\" as a choice because John did not mention that part of the question explicitly while he talks.\n\nAfter that, we can look through the list of options provided as a choice to simplify it. However, since the question does not contain option D or E, the choice B is the most likely option.\n\nB (seattle) is a city or town in American and in another word which is what john order.

In this case, it is:\nBanana A banana B an american banana C an american banana\n\nNext, we make rules so that our choice (A) can be the most likely answer and other choice cannot be possible answer.\n\nWe assume that the choice B cannot be correct because it's not in the list of choice, therefore the list of choice is the correct one.\n\nWe also assume that the list of choice cannot be possible because we cannot spell with the list of list. If we want to spell with the list of choice, it still means the first answer is (A).\n\nBy comparing the choices to the list of choice and the rules, it is obvious that the first choice (A) with the first letter (b) is the most accurate and probably the most likely, so (A) is the answer.", "answer": "C: curry"}

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nAgain, the first step is to clarify the context of the question by eliminating options that don't make any sense. Options such as \"art show\" (B) and D\"bar\" are out-of-place: a wine cellar is not an art show and a bar is not a place to store wine.\nThe other options \"attic\" (A) and \"basement\" (C), however, are plausible solutions to the problem. A wine cellar is often located in an attic or basement location, especially when the homeowner doesn't want the wine bottles to clutter their living space.\nBut \"attic\" and \"basement\" are in fact vague options: both could refer to a number of different locations underneath or on top of a house, such as under the stairs or in the closet.\n\nThis is where inference comes into play. Given the context of this question (specifically, that the wine is being stored for church) \"attic\" and basement are reasonable location options. But a wine cellar might also be found in a \"church basement\". This is the only location where the wine could be stored for any substantial length of time, since wine is a perishable food or drink.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nIt is unlikely that someone can be good at playing violin. For option A to be true, one would either have to be really good at playing violin, or love music.\n\nWhatever the case, option A can still be true. There is still the possibility that someone can be really good at playing the violin but do not like the music that it plays. In that case, option A would still be correct.\n\nSimilarly, option B does not necessarily have to be incorrect. The option does not specifically mention \"you\" being unable to create music. It only mentions that you will not be good at playing the violins, so the option would still be correct. \n\nHowever, option B is more likely to be false in the context of this question because option A is already false. The music played by a violin is generally of high-pitched and melodious nature, which would mean that someone who is good at playing it would likely produce beautiful music. Therefore, it is more likely that if one is not good at playing a violin, it is more likely to have a bad sound than create beautiful music. This conclusion is further supported by that we already know about our situation that the outcome is negative (we will become sad), so it logically follows that our music is more likely to be in a bad state than be good.\n\nFinally for option E, there are no logical reasons for it to be incorrect. Even if option A is correct, option B still does not have to be incorrect. It is unclear how being good at creating music differs from being good at playing the violn. In fact, it is highly likely that being able to create music is actually better than being able to play the violin, as the output of the music created using a violin has to go through further production processes, in which the music may get damaged or changed.\nSo option E is correct.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are given a list of numbers.

For instance, fruits and flowers can be sold too. \n\nTherefore, the only options left are \"vegetable market,\" \"food industry,\" or \"irish produce market,\" which probably does use potatoes in its products. Thus, the correct answer is B, \"vegetable market.\"\n\nInput: In 1751 Daniel Bernoulli published 'the theory of probability'. What was Bernoulli best known for?

The first is that there are two possible answers, which suggest the solution to be a logical one. The second is that the scenario is centered around a person with a pain in their head and face, and not any other bodily ailment.\n\nThe most logical choice out of the given options is the one that is consistent with the given context, which is \"that you have a head but don't have a a nose\" (E). It is consistent contextually, that when someone has pain in their head, and their face, then perhaps they have a headache and nose pain.

We assume that you could solve each reasoning task correctly if you could, but we will show you how to go about solving it.\nEach reasoning task has a statement, one of which is obviously unjustified.\nThe first answer that you have to think about is, the woman had to give up seat on bus for elderly gentleman (I'm not sure what your story was). If the woman had to give her seat for this, she couldn't have been giving up her seat to her grandfather, unless she only decided to cut in front of him at another time. This would suggest that the statement that states she cut him off should not have been given up because of its obvious unjustification.\n\nThe second statement that you have to determine whether or not is the man who gave up his seat for another passenger who thought he would be giving up his seat for her. Since the statement says that it is an unjustification then it is not the man who gave his seat to her and also cannot be true because the only one who did give up his seat for her was the man who had been in front of her all along.\n\nThe third statement is another one that is not unjustified in your answer.

The \"white\" part of the option refers to the building's architectural style, not its colour. \"Whitehouse\" is not a reasonable answer to the question, because the question refers specifically to columns of numbers.\n\nOption \"B: spreadsheet\" (C) is similarly incorrect. \"Spreadsheet\" refers to a type of document consisting of rows and columns, as indicated by the word \"spread.\" It does not describe or refer to the columns themselves. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.\n\nOption \"C: spreadsheet\" (D) is also inaccurate. The question again refers to \"columns of numbers,\" not the spreadsheet itself. Moreover, \"spreadsheet\" is an incorrect term to use for the columns themselves, as they are not in or made of a spread. \n\nOption \"E: roman architecture\" (A) is the only answer that answers the question correctly.

There are a few reasons for this conclusion: \n\n(1) \"model\" is usually used to refer to an object, such as \"model airplane\" or \"model city\". \nMoreover, it is an adjective which is generally followed by a noun. For example, \"The dog is a model pet.\" \n\n(2) When used as a noun, it is usually a synonym of \"example\".

In situations like these, one is often overcome with fear and panic, leading to a higher heart rate, excessive sweating, and maybe even a rash. This leads one to conclude that the final outcome is that they are wet.\n\nOption \"urinate\" (E), however, doesn't fit into the description as \"urination\" is involuntary in nature and doesn't necessarily require one to be \"full of fear\".\n\nThe answer is E: urinate", "answer": "E: urinate"}

Meanwhile, fire doesn't seem to have any bearing on Dan's home energy source.\n\nThis leaves us with a clear choice between \"fire\" and \"solar energy.\nAnd, in fact, it's already stated directly: fire doesn't power Dan's home.\nTherefore, the only reasonable choice is \"solar energy.\"\n\nTherefore the final answer is solar energy\n\nInput: What is the result of subtracting 59 + 34?

The term \"horseradish,\" by definition, has no correlation to sleeping.\n\nOption \"living room\" (C) is also out of the question. One cannot \"sleep in\" a living room.\n\nOption \"guest room\" (D) and \"basement\" (E) are still possible choices.  A key factor here is to pay attention to the context. A sleeper generally refers to a person using a single-bed instead of a double-bed or queen-sized bed (the most common types of beds). Therefore, a sleeper has to sleep on a single-bed.  The word single often means a \"person living alone.\"  This connotation leads to the removal of options C and D. \n\nNow, the remaining choice that can be eliminated through context analysis is E.

It is commonly used to refer to strength and power of the body. \"brawn\" is a noun that means strength and/or physical size or power. The noun \"brawn\" most often refers specifically to the use (or misuse) of physical strength and power as opposed to the use of one's brain. This refers to \"brawn\" rather than \"brains\" because he will be using his strength rather than his brains. As a noun, \u201cbrawn\u201d means 1. brawn, physical strength.\nWe can also get it by the sentence He said to me, \u300cI\u2019ll be able solve this problem by using brain RATHER THAN \u300d, the keyword is brain instead body. Then, \"what does brawn refer to?\" the question is. Because it's not related to the key word. the \"use of brain RATHER THA body\" is not what is meant by the key word \"brawn\".

While getting arrested and going to jail could result from drunk driving, it doesn't directly indicate that the person is intoxicated.\n\nOption C, \"SOBER\" (C) is clearly the most erroneous possibility. While getting intoxicated is a natural outcome of drinking beer, it doesn't mean that you're getting intoxicated because you want to.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is: option D: Intoxication.\n\nInput: What is the main similarity between the two words: warehouse and harbor.

Shape\nOutput: reasoning: \n\nThere are a few options that might immediately strike the reader as correct: option A: similarity in \"shape\" (A), option B: similarity in \"height\" (B), and option E: similarity in \"shape\", but all of these are irrelevant. In terms of similarity in shape, options \"A and B\" are incorrect because they would be implying that warehouse and harbour have similar shapes.\n\nInstead, the main similarity between warehouse and harbours is that they are both places where goods are stored. Therefore, the right answer is option \"C\": similarity of \"place\" (C).\nSo the final answer for this question = \"C: similarity of place.\"", "answer": "E: pleasure"}

They are places to work. Where a human might go on some leisure time? Maybe on a vacation. The question is clearly asking about a place where one will likely relax and enjoy themselves. This leaves us with workplace and deep thoughts as the best logical options. Work would likely be a place where one might feel stressed or harassed or forced.

Choices: \tA: the wolf went straight to the fox. B: The wolf was so sad, that it cried. C:the wolf was so hungry that it ate the fox. D: The wolf went straight to sleep. E:The wolf cried.\nOutput:Reasoning\n\nThere are two rules that will help you solve most questions. Firstly, use logic. Look at the situation and the way in which the characters responded, and ask yourself which of the answers is most likely to logically follow from the given information. Secondly, think about context. \n\nFor example, with this question, the farmer has announced that he will not share his food. It stands to reason that the wolf will not be satisfied with this news, so options B and C cannot be the correct responses.\n\nThat leaves three options that do not have context, so let\u2019s put them into context. The wolf is not satisfied, so why would the wolf go to the fox? The wolf could be starving, in which case the correct answer is C, but the narration indicates that the wolf is not starving.

Option A is the shirt pocket which is for storing items like change or keys, not ink.\nOption B is the calligrapher'swriting hand, which is a specialized way of handwriting used by calligraphers themselves, not something someone else would use for fountain pen ink.\n\nOption C is the inkwell which is a container for storing ink, rather than absorbing excess.

Choices:  H: go home I: play games L: get ready N: talk with the person M: call the dentist P: call your wife Q: stay at work R: get married S: go to a class T: learn programming\nOutput:Reason:\n\nSo the first aspect to consider is the urgency of the situation. Given the time available, it's impractical to either do a dental check up or learn programming for one's career (M and T, respectively). Both of these options are thus ruled out.\n\nThe next aspect to consider is the person\u2019s responsibilities. In this case, getting married is a monumental decision, and so this option is ruled out. Since the call to one's wife is probably a minor matter, and given the limited amount of time available, it is just as reasonable to assume that the player might not have a wife present. Therefore, this option is also ruled out.\n\nNext, we consider how important the decision would be to the player. Getting married, as we mentioned above, is a major decision. Therefore, it is also unlikely to be a concern immediately before a game. So this option is also ruled.\n\nFinally we consider the player\u2019s obligations, and the fact that this decision needs to be made before entering a game. Given these factors, it would be the most reasonable option to call the dentist (P), as it is an immediate concern, and one\u2019s overall health would obviously be a consideration before a game. Then, play games (L) would be the second choice, and given that it is plausible that one has already done this before the dentist call, one would just move on to the next task.\nSo the final sequence of actions would consist of the dentist call (P) followed by play a game (L), leaving the other options (H, I, M, N, Q, R, S, T) out.", "answer": "E: getting tired"}

This option is consistent with the context of Sean being found out and arrested for lying, which indicates that the active predicate is plausible.\n\nSimilarly, option \"problems\" (D) has been suggested as a potential active predicate, but the previous sentence implicated that Sean is lying about the crime, which does not seem to be a plausible scenario if he is facing problems.\n\nThe final option, \"trouble\" (E), is an active predicate that fits the context of Sean's actions.

A question about a beach wouldn't follow \"Great place to lay in the SUN,\" and vice versa a question about a beach wouldn\u2019t follow the word \"beans.\" There must be a relation between the choices. \n\nTherefore, the only two logical options remaining are in the solar system (B) and beans (E).

It seems logical to find a calculator somewhere within the office space, as opposed to far away places like the wardrobe or desktop. The wardrobe (B) and desktop (C) are not very likely locations to store calculators, because it would be difficult and inconvenient to retrieve them.\n\nAn office, whether it's in the accountant's home, or workplace, would be the most logical place to store a calculator regularly used for business purposes, which is why this would be the correct answer.\nTherefore, the final answer is D: office\n\nInput: You might need to buy a suit in the coming week, although you may need it for a wedding.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step in solving this question is to understand the context and purpose of the action being performed. In this case, the lab technician is testing the effectiveness of a new skin cream by pinching a small spot of skin and applying the cream.\n\nNext, consider the different sensations that may arise from what is described: a cream being applied to your skin, then being pinched and released by a lab technician.\n\nWhen analyzing these options, it is important to consider the different sensations involved. Answer A, \"it feels cold,\" doesn't work because the cream is being applied just before the pinching. So the skin would feel cold, not during the cream application.\nOption B, \"it feels pressure,\" is a bit of a stretch for this scenario. The resultant pressure is not likely to be enough to cause pain; instead, a mild pinching/releasing sensation would more likely occur.\nOption C, \"it feels bumpy,\" doesn't seem right either. A bumpy feeling would be more likely from an object being pressed into the skin, not a skin cream being applied.\n\nFinally option D, \"it itches,\" does capture the essence of the scenario. After the cream is applied, it is very likely that the skin will feel itchy. Hence this is the most plausible answer.\n\nInput: In the case of all diseases are not contagious. Choices:  A. False B. True C. Distrust D. Incontestable E. Indeterminate\nOutput: Reason(s):\n\nIn this question, the key is to understand what is meant by \"contagious\". In most cases, contagious refers to the spread of disease from person to person through direct contact or through airborne or surface pathogens.\nMany diseases require physical contact to be transmitted from person to person. Chicken pox is a classic example. Some diseases cause more serious symptoms if the virus spreads to a larger population. \n\nIn other cases, \"contagious\" can refer to the presence of bacteria or viruses found in the body, in the air, or on surfaces. A bacterial or viral infection means the \"contagious\" disease is present and spread from one person to another through", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}

Choices:  C: The eyes are looking down.  B: No, the eyes are looking up.  A: No, the cucumber is cut in half.  D: No, the nose is pointing down. E: This answer is incorrect.\nOutput: Reasonable:\n\nThis question, like many multiple-choice tests, has two wrong answers, which are marked in the question as incorrect. This leaves two answers, which must be both true. \n\nThe first answer to this question is 'C', which asserts that the cucumber\u2019s frown comes from the way the eyes are looking down. The problem with this answer, though, is that the cucumber doesn\u2019t have any eyes. We\u2019ve been given the question \u201cWhy does the cucumber feel like it\u2019s frowned?\u201d, so by definition, it must not have eyeballs or eyelids. The question doesn\u2019t ask why the cucumber looks frowning; rather, the question is why the cucumber feels like it\u2019s fussed.\n\nAnswer 'B', which says that the eyes aren\u2019t looking up, also doesn\u2019t hold up. Because there aren\u2019t any eyes in the cucumber, it is also impossible for it to be looking up or down, because the cucumber doesn't have anything that can be up or down.\n\nThe answer is 'A', which says that it\u2019s because the cucumber is half its normal length - specifically, because the cucumbers has been cut in half.\n\nInput: What do you do when your head is stuck in a bucket of feathers?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe correct answer could use any synonym of \"standing\". \"Experience\" (E), although used in the question stem, is unnecessary, as the option gives no additional information beyond the verb \"stand\". \n\nThe option of \"sleep\" (E) is incorrect because it indicates the opposite of standing - sitting. The play can only cause the audience to stand, as opposed to sitting.\n\nSimilarly, the option of \"make reservations\" (C) is irrelevant and can be eliminated from consideration. This phrase may indicate that the audience would like to see the play in the future, but it does not relate to the current scenario of people standing during the play. \n\nOnly the remaining options have synonyms for \"stand\", thus narrowing the answer to \"admiration\" (A), \"applaud\" (B), and \"standing\" (C). \"Admiration\" (A) is less common than \"applaud\" or \"standing\", so that could be the reason for its repetition in the options.\n\nOverall, option \"standing\" (C) should be chosen.\n\nInput:The old man was walking and what?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first thing we observe is that, from the context, we know that the \"dining table,\" referred to in the question, isn't the answer to a different question about where to buy some furniture. The only relevant question relates back to where a \"dining table\" can be placed within a certain location. The options given are a few different options, so the first step is to eliminate any options that are inappropriate:\n\n* \"arranging papers\" (C): This doesn't really seem to fit the description of putting a table somewhere.\n* \"formal dining room\" (D): The term \"dining room\" implies that a formal setting would be appropriate. The question doesn't ask about how to have a formal meal at that table; so the formal dining room option is eliminated.\n\nLet's analyze each option in further detail:\n\n* \"cafeteria\" (A): This is a possible option, but it doesn't seem to completely fit in with the other options given. In the \"office\" sense, the cafeteria would be the same as the \"arranging papers\" choice (i.e., it would be the place to work and not to eat), but this doesn't mesh with the question about where to place a table. It would be possible to place a table in a cafeteria, but it would be used for consumption rather than placing objects down. Therefore, this particular option is eliminated as well.  \n\n* \"in the park\" (B): This choice is eliminated because the question already includes a place that would be very similar to the park (it's a place to eat and sit down rather than the place to consume objects).\n\nAfter we've completed this process, we can determine that there are only two options left: the formal dining area (D) and the cafeteria (A). But the option of making it the formal dining area would be redundant with another choice given in the question. The cafeteria, meanwhile, has a significant distinction from the other three: it implies the possibility of an entire meal, including eating. The meal is not implied for the formal eating choice (B) - a meal is simply a part of the dining process. Therefore, this would explain why we were supposed to put a new table in the", "answer": "E: house"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nOption A is probably the most obvious candidate. People may go to markets to buy different kinds of food, but these foods aren't bought on a whim. Instead, they are a means for people to cope with stress, usually caused by busy work schedules.\n\nOption B is another potential answer, in that some people go to markets to have a break from their regular lives by engaging in a hobby such as baking or gardening.\nHowever, both options A and B have weak points. Both options involve the word \"that,\" suggesting that people go to markets because they want that (the food or hobby). In this sentence structure, the word \"that\" is actually more likely to be used for an external goal rather than internal emotions.\n\nOptions C and D are essentially different versions of the same answer - people spend money to buy food, which alleviates stress caused by long jobs and busy schedules. This answer is also vague and can be inferred from the question without the need for any prior knowledge (like the hobby example from option B, and the answer can be interpreted in more than one way. One person could be going to the market to buy groceries while another person could be going to buy a meal outside. The latter could also be considered a form of leisure.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable answer would be B: food, since it's the least specific version.\nSo the the final answer is B: food", "answer": "C: that you"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nIn the given sentence the word \"played\" can either refer to the noun \"the bassoon\" or the verb \"to play\". Therefore, the first thing to do is differentiate between them. If the noun is being used, the context will be: what kind of environment does a bassoon sounds well (played) in. On the other hand, if the verb is being used, the question will be about which environment does one hear \"THE bassoon played in an UNpleasing fashion\". Now you can cross-out \"orchestra\" (which would be the usual way a bassoon sounds) and \"symphony\" (as you can't listen to individual instruments in it) which leaves us with \"high school band\" (since it sounds bad in every other context except a high school band).\n\nOutput:Reasoning:\n\nThis type of question can often trip you up. The clue is to look out for subtle differences in the sentence. In this question, the answer can be found by analysing the word \"unpleasing\" - does it mean \"disagreeable to the ear\" or does it mean \"not pleasant\" or other synonyms. If the answer is the first, the question would suggest somewhere that the music is played in, not the musician herself. On the other hand if it should be \"not pleasant\", you have to look out for the words \"music sounds\". That's an indication that the question is about the music being played, and not the musician. This leads us to two conclusions, either \"baritone woodwind sound\" or \"play music\".\n\nSince the woodwind instrument cannot be played by one person, and \"play music\" does not help us discern between playing the musical instrument and playing the music, the answer is \"baritone woodwinds\".\n\n## # Input:You can hear an orchestra in the distance and wonder if you can go for a walk and get there in time for it to start playing.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe key to answering this question is understanding the definition of the word \"printer\" in the context of this question. A printer is a physical device that produces copies of documents or images. This means that printers are not typically used in places where individuals work, such as a \"home office\" (B) or a \"school\" (A).\n\nA printer cannot be used by thousands of individuals at a time. However, a printing press can be used in a \"newspaper office\" (E), where large numbers of articles and news stories are produced daily.

{"text": "Reason: The context of the question does not provide sufficient information to disregard any available options. \n\nTo answer the question, we must first determine what the subject at hand may require additional details or additions to their information.\n\nOption \"bus stop\" sounds reasonable - the question says \"add\" something. Thus option A can be ruled out.\n\nIt also doesn't make sense that they would add grass. The line of the paragraph doesn't mention anything about grass, nor does it speak of adding anything to the post office or play. The only line that hints at adding something is the bus stop, making option B the more sensible choice.\n\nFinally option E \"play\", is just not suitable for the situation mentioned in the prompt. Play is not a line, addition or addition material, therefore E must be disregarded.\n\nOptions A and B seem to be viable candidates for the correct answer. However, by evaluating the context and the information given in the prompt, it can be concluded that B is the correct answer.\n\nThe given information tells us that someone would like to add a line to a bus stop, so option B is the more appropriate choice because the answer mentions a bus stop. As such, the correct answer to this question is option B:  bus stop\n\nInput:What is an adjective for what they did to the tree?

There are also other ways to appreciate nature aside from learning about science, such as through travel or art, and so this option is wrong.\n\nInput:The first thing a nurse should do when providing care is to respect the patient's Choices:  A:\"I can do this, I'm a nurse!\" B: \"It must be nice to have your own room!\" C: \"Didn\u2019t you used to be a patient here?\" D: \"I got you.\" E: \"Welcome to x hospital\"\nOutput\nReasoning:\nThe option \"didn't you used to be here\"? (E) could be interpreted as a way of welcoming a patient into the hospital and showing that they are surrounded by people who care about them. \nThe option \"I got you\"(d) could be seen as an expression of support and reassurance, which are essential components of providing care.\nNurses are expected to maintain professionalism and compassion while providing care. The other answers could be construed as not being respectful to the patient, as they are either showing lack of respect for the patient (B) or making unrelated comments that are insensitive to the patient's situation (C). The fourth option (D), which is simply stating the phrase \"I got you\" is a phrase commonly used in US English, which makes it more likely that a US English speaker would find it acceptable.\n\nThe correct answer is D: \"I got\"\n\nInput:The \"good\" person may sacrifice their own life Choices:  A:`sacrifice their own happiness or security B: to \"do what is right\" C: even when it", "answer": "E: see things differently"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe purpose of asking this question is to identify the intended geographical destination of the expressway. When looking at the alternatives, the first consideration is to discard those that do not seem to apply to the scenario, such as \"map\" (B). We know the expressway does not exist on a map so it should be eliminated.\nNext, we should think about what the answer might not be, which often gives us a hint as to what it might be. For example, \"not map\" (C) suggests an alternative. The answer choice \"country\" (E), therefore, eliminates \"map\" (B) and suggests \"not map\" (D) which can lead us to the correct answer, \"country\" (D), by process of elimination.\nAs another example, if you think about what the answer cannot be, the answer choice \"map\" (B), it also eliminates \"not map\" (E) because that cannot be the case. Then, \"not rest stops\" (D) is the remaining choice. This eliminates \"map\" and \"rest stops\" (D)(F) as well as \"American city\" (F) and leaves us with the correct answer, \"not rest stops.\"\nSo the final answer here is C: not country\n\nInput:In a movie, there are actors and actresses, the actors are what?

However, \"yeah\" (C) is an incorrect answer because there are only four answers, whereas there should be five. Therefore, the answer is C: male actors.\n\nInput: A \"Hunger Games\" franchise, many people enjoy this franchise. This franchise involves what? Choices: F: People. A: games.

{"text": "Reasoned:\n\nWe first have to identify the options that are irrelevant to the context of the statement.\n\nOption \"laughter\" (B) is out since happiness isn't limited to laughter. There are many forms of expressions in which one can express happiness.\n\nOption \"tears \" (E) is out as well since it isn't a form of expression for happiness. Option (D) is possible, but the most relevant answer would be \"smiles\", as smiling is universally recognised as an expression of happiness.\n\nSince only two options remain, it is possible to eliminate \"love\" (C) since smiling and laughing are forms of happiness which we use at times with ourselves too. Therefore, we would be left with only \"happiness\" (D).\n\nInput: What is a way you can increase your awareness to problems in the world? Choices:  I: Read the news about problems in the world. II: Be happy. III: Write to congress about the problems in the world. IV: Talk to people about the problems in the\nworld\nOutput: Reason:\n\nThe first step is to analyse each option. The first two options, \"Read the news about problems in  the world\" (I) and \"Talk to people about the world\" (IV), are very easy to eliminate since they are not relevant to the context of increasing your awareness. If you're reading to get news, you're not increasing your awareness of problems.\n\nThe second set of options \"Write to congress about problems in the world\" (III) and \"Be happy\" (II), are very generic, and we are better left without any useful information from these two, since happy people don't always know the problems of the world.\n\nHowever, the single remaining option, which is \"do not care, you should be happy not aware\" (II) is actually correct. Being happy about problems will not make you aware of whatever problems there are.\n\nInput: What does everyone in the lab do every day? Choices: A: Write some lab codes. B: Innovating.

It's also unclear what \"events\" the speaker is referring to.\n\nSimilarly, option \"dress themselves\" (D) does not fit the requested action of brainstorming. And it may be grammatically incorrect to say \"dress themselves\" in this context, as the reference to \"themselves\" might be ambiguous.\n\nOnly the option \"think creatively\" (E) fits the request to brainstorm ideas.

{"text": "Reason:\nThe first task is parsing apart the question and locating the entities that are described. In this case, the \"rod\" in the question would refer to a specific rod or fishing rod. This would eliminate options like \"fish camp\" (B) and the \"hardware store\" (C), neither of which refer to a specific rod.\n\nThe next task involves deciding which definition fits best for the entity of \"hardware store\", and then moving on to determine what entity corresponds to \"rod\".\n\nThe only thing that really fits in \"hardware store\" is \"threw a rod\", which is not really what is meant by a hardware store. A hardware store is a place where you would buy tools. So while \"hardware store\" could be taken to represent a store that sells rods, it's probably more helpful to decide what the entity referred to is using a different metaphor. This is the same reason why \"fish camp\" (option/B) was already disqualified. You don't go to a fish camp and throw rods, you go to a fish camp with rods and use them.\nTherefore, the metaphor that fits best with the entity \"rod\" is the one that mentions a \"spine\", which would be option \"D: your spine\". So the final answer is \"D: your spinal column\".\n\nInput: Which of the following is a true about the US's education system when compared to the education system in many South American countries?

{"text": "Reason: \n\nThe first task of this choice is clarifying the context. We know that John has run out of pencils, which means that he was once in possession of some. The choice \"desk drawer\" (A) is likely to hold a box of pencils. So this is a plausible option.\n\nBUT, we can also infer that he must have lost the pencils, meaning that he's not re-sharpening one that is running out of lead, but rather retrieving a whole new pencil.\n\nAs for \"cup\" (B), this only provides a very vague solution, since it doesn't specify where the pencil is kept. It could be in a desk drawer, it could be the cup at his desk, or it could be the cup that he drinks from.\n\nThe choice \"pencil case\" (C), while a reasonable assumption to make, actually lacks the context that \"desk drawer, \" has. The context points to desk accessories. This is important, because John ran out of pencil, so we can infer with greater confidence that he was in possession of a pencil case.\n\n\"Shelf\" (D) is also plausible, since a box of pencil could be stored on his desk shelf as well.\n\nThe final option of the answer is \"Office Depot\" (E). John knows that he has run out of pence so he must go to the store that he procures his supplies from. This eliminates \"shelf\" (D) and other viable options such as \"cup\" (B).\nSo, the answer that best fits the scenario is C: pencilcase", "answer": "E: office depot"}

This would be one of the only times that an answer choice involves action.\nOption B is the most viable choice: when a char is full of people, they are refusing to leave. The char is also full because it is also occupied by people - that is, the char is full of people doing what the passengers are doing (which is either refusing to leave the char or sitting down). \n\nChoice C would also be correct if a person were physically saving money (as the money has intrinsic value, unlike money on a bank). However, the money being saved implies the person has a char to sit in. So this choice, while accurate, would involve an additional action. \n\nChoice \"sit down\" (D) is incorrect here: there is no choice, because all the seats are taken.

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nThere are a couple of key points to note here.\n1. When an item you have purchased at a shop is \"imported\", it means that it was not grown/manufactured/sold in your nation. \n2. While \"Ohio\" (A), \"Washington State\" (B), \"Alaska\" (C), and \"Canada\" (D) are distinct regions in the USA, they are still a part of the United States. They are therefore non-imported goods.\n3. If the item was manufactured or grown in \"Canada\" (refer point 2), it would indeed be an imported commodity.\n4. While Canada might seem like an \"imported good\", it is not because the USA doesn't pay duty on goods from other states in the USA.\nNow that the context is straight, we can focus on the specific purpose behind our question, which is: what makes an item an imported good. By eliminating \"Ohio\", \"Washington State\", \"Alaska\", and \"Canada\" as they do NOT make something an imported good, that leaves option E, where an item is an imported good when it originates elsewhere than the US.\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\nInput:The scientist asked his assistant to put their results into a chart to represent them all.

{"text": "The correct answer to this multiple choice question is \"training\".\n\nExplanation: Option \"training\" was the correct answer to the question. The phrase \"does not cause\" suggests that it is always important to groom a pet's nails correctly. Grooming is a procedure that involves training a pet, and therefore, it cannot cause injury.\n\nOption \"injury\" does not fit the intended meaning of the sentence. An injury, by definition, is caused by an intervention or an event causing damage to tissue. Thus, it would be unusual or incorrect to use the term \"injury\" to describe the potential outcome of grooming a pet's nail.\n\nOption \"satisfaction\" is also not correct. This option suggests that grooming is an act to make the pet satisfied with the procedure. As previously mentioned, grooming requires training the pet, which would result in the owner gaining a certain degree of satisfaction, but not the pet itself.\n\nOption \"beauty\" does not make sense in this context. Grooming a pet's toes would help the owner gain satisfaction and beauty. But it would not have any effect on making the pet more attractive to the owner.\n\nFinally \"late\" is an incorrect answer to the question. Late is not always necessary for grooming a dog's nails. It could be done on a random basis, just like a health checkup for a pet, and would not take up the owner's time late.\n\nSo, as a whole the answer is \"training\".\n# input: The man was very depressed and wanted to hurt what: Choices:  A. Someone's face. B. His own face.\n\nOutput: A. The correct answer to the multiple choice question was \"someone's face\".\n\nExplanatio: The answer was already indicated by the question's structure and context.\n\nThe question is in the passive voice, and it does not mention the identity of the subject, indicating that it wants to use the active voice of \"hurt someone's face\". The question also suggests that the man was very depressed. Such psychological condition is unrelated to \"hurt my face\".\n\nOption \"his own face\" is the most common option among the four choices. But this option would not fit the intended meaning. By using this phrase to phrase the question, it would", "answer": "C: injury"}
{"text": "Reasoning:\nThe first step is to determine what purpose breakfast in bed might serve. \n\nThe only obvious reason is as a sort of pampering or luxurious practice. Therefore, the options which focus on gaining pleasure (B) and content (D) should be immediately excluded. \n\nBut we can't discount the possibility that someone might spill something if eating in bed. For that to be ruled out, we'd have to assume that the scientist is \"superhuman\" with perfectly steadfast hands. It's highly unlikely that such a perfect scientist would be described in a logic puzzle, which means that the chance of anything being spilled is almost certain. \n\nTherefore, the only other viable answer would be \"happiness\" (C). There are no known negative consequences to having breakfast in bed, and eating happily is a common activity which could come with the meal.\n\n### Link:\nhttps://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcode-lc-interview-questions/10/", "answer": "D: contentment"}
{"text": "Reason: The judge's actions in this scenario lead to what? \"To condemn\" (D) is a suitable answer.\n\nThe judge's actions involve deciding what punishment to give the man at his trial. That would obviously be a decision of his own volition, which means the man is condemned to the jail by the judge's decision. This is why \"death\" (E) is incorrect. While that was indeed the sentence, what really condemned the man to jail was the judge's decision to pass sentence. Therefore, it was the judge who \"condemned\" him, which led to his jail sentence.\n\nNext, \"judgement\" (B) does not mean condemnation. A judgement is merely a decision or opinion, and could mean the opposite of condemnation. Likewise, \"go to jail\" (A) doesn't fit because the judge's passing sentence ultimately decided the outcome. \"Incarceration\" (C) is also incorrect because it does not directly fit either of the previous definitions of \"condemn\", nor does it mean condemnation.\n\nFinally there is \"passing sentence\" (F). However, a passing sentence was not the outcome of the man's trial but the sentence itself. Also, \"passing sentence\" does not necessarily equal \"judgement\".\n\nSince none of these options are correct, the correct answer is \"death\".", "answer": "D: death"}

How should the scientist summarize the results? Choices:  \"There were bacteria.\" \"All the bacteria were true bacteria.\" \"Everything is bacteria.\" \"Some bacteria are other kinds of bacteria.\" \nOutput: Reasonlogy:\n\n1. \"There were bacterio\" is not a suitable response, because it doesn't describe the experiment's results in general. It is also not an exact answer to the original question, which was \"How should the scientist summari the results?\"\n2. \"All the bacterio\" (D) would not be the best summary, as this would imply that all of the bones were part of the bacteria (or bacterio) sample.\n3. \"Everything is bacoeria\" would be an incorrect answer, as the response doesn't accurately summarize the results. It is also possible to have non-bacterial bones, so \"everything\" would be too broad and general.\n4. \"Some bactoria are other kinds of\" would be incorrect because the \"are\" indicates that something is related to bacteria. However, no such conclusion can be drawn from the results of the experiment.\n5. So the only correct response that answers the original question perfectly is \"Some bacteria is other kinds of bacterium.\" Reasoning:\n6. The first step is to identify the main purpose of the summary. Specifically, it should outline the general conclusion from the experiment.\n7. The next task is to identify the main points of the results. In this case, the results should indicate that all of the bone samples were bacterial in nature. Thus, the correct summary should reflect these primary insights.\n8. The final step is to combine these two pieces of information to generate an accurate summary. This could look something like \"Some bacteria was other kinds of bacterial", "answer": "D: pleasure"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nOption \"blood isn't usually  spilled in a soccer game\" (A) is partially correct: blood can be spilled in a soda game, but not during the actual soccer play. If you've ever seen a soccer player roll on the ground (because they got an accidental elbow or foot to the face), they're \"spilling their blood\" - but it's not part of the sport itself.\n\nOption \"bloody sport that doesn't not allow the use of hands\" (B) is technically grammatically correct, but the spelling is incorrect and the order of the words is incorrect. We would say that a bloody \"sport is\", not that bloody \"sports\" allow for the use of hands. Moreover, a sport doesn't allow anything - humans are allowed to play certain sports, but not a sport itself.\n\nOptions \"animals\" (B) and \"'sport that doesn't allow hands'\" (E) are also both wrong. If a sport did involve the use of arms and hands, the animal would probably have to have arms and hands to play said sport. Likewise, if humans were to develop extra arms and hands specifically for playing that sport, we likely wouldn't still call it \"an animals sport\", but rather still a human competition.\n\nOption \"ball\" (D) is a plausible response, but it would depend on the specific sport. In basketball and cricket, for example, it's the ball that the participants use, but it's still played by humans and we would call it a sport that humans play, not a sport with blood.\n\nFinally option \"game\" (C) is the most appropriate choice. A game can be categorized as a sport. If you were asked whether a person plays an animals sport, you would probably respond \"yes\", or at least \"the person plays the sports with the animals\". But if you're asked to categorize the sport as a whole, the sport is no longer related to a person. If you were to categorize the sport with a animal, you would probably call it a sport, instead.\n\nIn addition to the spelling error, option \"Blood isn'tn't usually spilled in a person game\" (C) also doesn't describe the kind of blood spillage described in the question.

Choices:  A\"B:C:D:E:\nOutput:Reason:\nIn the given sentence context, \"I'll\" = subject and \"you\" = object. The predicate in English, or \"main clause\", is \"be honest\" and it is negated by \"not\". The verb forms are in the negative: \"won't\" for third person singular subject \"I\" and \"won't be\" for second person singular object \"you\". This is a negative sentence. There is a predicate in the embedded clause which is \"be honest\".\n\nInput:The city council debated the proposed budgeting changes for days. Choices:  { A:B:C:D}\nOutput:Reason:-\nIn the sentence above, \"The city council debated\" is the main clause.\n\"The city council debated for days\" is the embedded clause.\nAs a result, the sentence is in the passive-voice.\n\nInput:The car is a vehicle that transports passengers.

{"text": "Reason:\n\n\nAnswer: The first part of this question refers to the purpose of exercise. There aren't many options that don't involve exercise, but it turns out none of them are related to exercise, which is incorrect. The second part of this question does not appear to be looking for a specific consequence of exercise. This makes it likely that a consequence, rather than a purpose, is the correct answer.\n\nThe answers we've eliminated first are \"condition heart\" and \"weigh\" because they are not consequences and \"stretch\" because it says it's a consequence.\n\nOut of the remaining answers, \"exercise\" and \"expend energy\", none of the options are what the question is looking for.\n\n\"healthy way to do what\", which doesn't seem to mean anything, is a possibility, but the word \"what\" immediately excludes it, as well as some of the remaining choices.\n\nSo the final answer would be A: expend energy.\n\nInput:What did the scientist want to do with the lab data? Choices: A: analyze it B: publish it C: present it D: test it E: summarize it\nOutput: Reason\n\nA: analyse it (B) - analysing the data isn't an action, but rather an activity\n\nB: publish it (A) - publishing the output of the study isn't an outcome of data analysis\n\nThe remaining options are C, D, E.\n\nThe first two options are likely eliminated because C) is about the presentation of data, which is done before data analysis, while D) is about testing data, which is done as part of analysis.\n\nOut of those that remain, the answer has to be about the outcome of the analysis of the data. So the last two options are the most likely answers and the final answer is E) summarize it\n\nAnswer: The question is asking what the scientist wants to do. The options are all actions, but in reality, an action involves a doer and an object. The object is what the scientist wants. Therefore, we look at what is not said.

{"text": "The shop will give you cash for your purchases.Reasoning: The answers provided the the question:\n* * \"A shop will give you for your purchases.\" * \"A shop will \"give you\" for your purchases.\" Reasoning: \"For\" is a preposition and is a part of the sentence. No other verb follows the preposition which means that the shop will provide you with an incentive in the form of \"for\"(the incentive) and something else.\n\n* * \"A ship will give you for your shopping.\" * \"A shop \"will give you\" for your shopping.\" Reasoning: Once again the shop will give you something. \"Will\" is a verb and it denotes a future action. So the shop will provide you money for your shopping.

Choices: 12. 12 A: The Bahamas B: The Dominican Republic C: England D: Haiti E: Japan\nOutput: Reason :\n\n\n1.The word \"best\" in the sentence suggests they have a strong bond.\n2.The use of the words \"I spent most of my time with\" is used in the phrase \"you and me against the world\".\n3.The words \"I have known him since elementary\" can probably be paraphrased to be \" I have known him since preschool or kindergarten.\"\n\n4.The use of the word \"since\" could be used to suggest the start of a relationship.\n\n5.The phrase \"with my bestie\" can be interpreted to mean that the person can possibly be the opposite gender (i.e. the best way of showing that they can trust eachother is sharing secrets and stuff) and most likely that they are friends.\n\n6.\u201cMy best friend is the person that I spend most of my times with.\u201d - this means that the relationship is most probably strong enough to be labeled as a friend.\n\n7.A \"Best friend\" can most of the time also be a lover (friend relationship), so from this sentence it could be said that I have known this person since elementary.\n\n8.

Choices:  C: 98 E: 108\nOutput:Reasonning:We can see that the correct answer option is E, as it is the only one that is a three-digit number.All other options are less than 100.This clearly indicates that the correct answer choice is option E with value 108.\n \nInput: Where would you find the biggest flock of birds in the world? At the airport or during a parade?Choices:  E: Both A: At the airport B: During a parade\nOutput:Reasonng:Let's take an example below. Here we have a flock of 200 birds. So, we can clearly see that the flock is of the 200 birds rather it is 200 thousand or 200 million. Therefore, it can be easily seen that it is not correct to compare the number a flock of birds with the number of parking spaces at the airport.\n\nTherefore, we can easily mark the answer option for E with 'Both' as the correct one.\nHence, we can clearly understand that the option for E is correct.\n\nInput: We can tell if two people have the same genetic parent based on a DNA test.

The scenario does not suggest there are illnesses or any other health disorders caused by eating uncooked chicken.\n\nThe next two options, \"indigestion\" (A) and \"throwing up\" (E), are close but not accurate enough. The man could be suffering from either condition, but that is not what is asked.\n\nThe final option \"feel better\" (D) is the most specific in capturing the situation: when the man eats, he should *feel better* - not feel worse or sick to his stomach.

{"text": "Reasonning:\n\nWe now have multiple choice answer choices we can work with. In this case, we will start by eliminating answers that have nothing to do with children. Of course, not every answer choice will be relevant. Some will make perfect sense for the context of this question, while others will never be relevant. \n\nAnswer choice E (fun) is very relevant to children and the topic of reproduction. However, it doesn't have anything to do with birth. \n\nNext, we consider the word \"begets\" in the prompt. What does \u201cto beget\u201d mean? In this context, \u201cbeget\u201d refers to \u201cthe initial creation of.\u201d This means answer choices that do not explain the process of birth would be eliminated. Since answer choices B (birth) and answer choices D (propagation), both fail to do this. Hence options are eliminated.\n\nNext, as for answer choice A (overpopulation), some of it is clearly relevant to this context, but the word \"overpopulation\" also conveys the idea of an excess or superfluity. This suggests it is not the correct answer, since it is not about a new life coming into being. \n\nFinally, we should consider the answer that is fully relevant: answer choice E (fun). This provides the entire context (new life), conveys the purpose (the fun!), and the exact process (giving). Hence, the answer is E: give birth\n\nInput: The students are so excited to have their books back, but some of the students forgot what? Choices: A: where they placed B: to take notes C: to read D: class E: read\nOutput: Reasonin:\n\nIn this scenario, the students were excited to receive their books back. This means the correct answer choice should relate to a sense of anticipation and expectation. If there is anything that could help students feel excited, it would be a reminder of where they kept their books.\n\nThere is another relevant context here but a more specific reminder to the correct answer - that is to \"read\" (D)'s books. However, as a standalone answer, \"to read\" cannot carry much weight to the students. It sounds more like an instruction, where as the context suggests \"to take notes\". \n\nSo, we have narrowed down our answer choices to \"take notes\".", "answer": "B: birth"}

Choices: \t A: the Netherlands B: Italy C: South Africa D: Sweden E: China\nOutput: Reason:- The Netherlands is often viewed as a bicycle-friendly tourist destination. This reflects a distinct lack of pollution and traffic noise. So option B, \"the Netherlands,\" is the most logical pick among the given choices.\n\nInput:Which of these places wouldn't I visit with the family? Choices:  B: the zoo A: the grocery store D: the movies C: the mall E: amusement park\nOutput: ReasonThe term \"amusement park\" refers to a destination that offers fun and excitement to visitors. It is not a place you would bring a small child to in order to save money.\n\nThe given options offer examples of places a small child would enjoy, such as the zoo (\"B,\" the zoo), and the amusement park (\"D,\" the amusement park).\n\nThe mall (C) is a common location for high-end shopping. Also, a typical visit to the movies (A) costs approximately $ 10. Therefore, the mall or a movie outing is more expensive than visiting the zoo.\n\nSince the mall, the movies, and the amusement park are more expensive and not suitable for a small child, the safest option would be to visit the grocery store (B), which is more cost-effective.\nSo the correct answer is B: the zoo\n\nInput: Why doesn't the US have a royal family?\nOutput: Reason-\nIt's common knowledge that the government in the US is a democracy. Therefore, it is considered important for the leaders of that government to be elected by the people.

{"text": "Reason:\nThe clue lies in the question's reference to the phrase \"in a land locked, southern state\". If we have in mind that we are indeed in a land-locked southern state, any answer that does not include a reference to the fox in question will not be correct.\nThis leaves us with three other remaining options - south carolina, arkansasand louisiana.\nAmong these three options, choosing arkansas will immediately result in a wrong answer because \"Hen House\" is the reference for a place where poultry are kept. Lousiana is out because it is simply too far away from the land-locked state. The remaining option is south carolina. Choosing this results in an accurate answer.\n\nInput:In which state is San Francisco? Choices: A: new york B: new jersey C: pennsylvania D: ohio E: ohio\nOutput: Reason\nWhile the clue doesn't provide any information related to San Francisco, it does offer additional information that gives us insight into where San Francisco is likely to be.\nThere are a number of landmarks in the eastern US that are connected to San Francisco such as the Golden Gate bridge, Lombard street, and Pier 39. As San Francisco is located on the west coast, and we are given that we are in the land of the landlocked, it is likely that we are in the Midwestern or eastern US states. This means that we are in states where Ohio could likely be. It is also located in states that have other major cities that San Francisco may be connected to like Philadelphia or Boston.\nWhich means New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are out. Ohio is the only answer that makes sense here.\n\nInput:According to the clue, the state is landlocked, in the lower case, and in a different state than where the fox is. Which of the following states meets these conditions?

The only options that are in the landlocked states are the lowercase states.

(1) is wrong, and even if a person referred to a female person as \"it\" (they wouldn't be saying any person, just a female), 2 would still be ruled out as the word 'it' can't refer to a person, ever.\n\nAnswer: A: tiger and 5: a female reproductive organs \n\nIt is definitely not a person.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nTo start, Sam is a character who's looking for a particular thing: a \"giant hole\" in the \"plain.\" Because it's a plain, not a mountain, the obvious answer is \"A: hill.\" \n\nHowever, \"hill\" (A) is the incorrect answer, because a hill (typically) is steep. However, this plain is flat and featureless, making it \"a bit dull.\" Choosing an option that doesn't describe the plain seems implausible.\n\nNext, the options \"B: gorge\" (C) and \"D: cliff\" (D) may appear plausible because of how deep these features may seem, but there's a problem with each.\nFirst, a \"gorge\" (B) is a landform usually created by the erosion of a river.  Because it's not a water body, \"A: plain\" (C) is the most plausible option because it is flat. \n\nSecond, \"D: cliff,\" a high escarpment along the edge of a plateau, seems to fit at first, but there is no evidence that this flat plain extends over the edge of a plateaus.\n\nAs a result, the only remaining option is \"E: mountain\" (E). A mountain is simply a lofty feature on the land; the only other answer that fits the context of this scenario. Choosing \"A: hill\" (C) would be correct.\nSo, the final answer is E : Mountain\nInput:There were some interesting letters in the spam folder today.  If people receive this type of email, what is it called?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step is to analyze the question, which leads to answer A: learning. Learning is needed to \"learn whether seeing the artifact was in fact seeing\".\n\nThe second step is to disambiguate the purpose for learning. If \"learning\" was the purpose for the task at hand, than the purpose would be to know whether these artifacts are real. If \"doing math\" is needed, the answer must be \"Doing Math\".\nBy this logic \"A - learning\" does not fit the purpose \"learn whether the images shown were actually visible\"\n\nThe same logic applies to \"C: thinking\" and \"B: memories\". In both cases, \"learn whether the images...were actually visible\" would become the purpose, while \"thinking\" and \"memories\" would then be the methods to achieve this purpose. Both \"thinking\" and\"memories\" would violate the rules set forth in \"C\"\n\nAs \"memories\" and \"thinking\" are rejected, answer \"B: thinking\" has to be a choice. There is then a choice of \"E: pleasure\" or \"D: awe inspiring\". The second part of \"D: awe-inspiring\" states that there is pleasure for awe inspiring. So \"D\" must be one of the available choices.\n\nAs \"D\" has now become an available choice, the logical answer is \"D: Awe Inspiring\"\n\nInput: The researchers had been given data and were to be analyzed to which?

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first thing to consider when answering this multiple choice question is the context of the question itself. The question presents a man who committed suicide, which implies that he was suffering or unhappy. This eliminates options \"he was happy\" (B) and a \"avoid problems\" (C).\nThe man's motivation can only be further interpreted based on his state of mind - \"he was unhappy\" and \"he was suffering\" (those cannot be disregarded).\n\nOptions D and E can be safely ruled out. The choice \"avoid problems\" is not likely, as suicide is a drastic action that often is taken as a response to intolerable problems. And the choice \"end pain\" is unlikely, because the question's statement asserts that the man was miserable \"for many years\". So these cannot be accepted.\n\nThis leaves us with only one option - the choice of \"he was unhappy\", because it is the most logical fit for the information provided by the question.\n\n\nInput:I've met my girlfriend, we've been dating for 7 years and we're planning to get married in the summer, I couldn't be more exited. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever known and I love her with all my heart. What I don't like, she spends too much money.

Option A \"I've met my dream girl\" is clearly incorrect if you consider the context of the question as a whole. The man has not met his girlfriend as she is not a newcomer to his life, but the subject of a relationship for 7 years. This means, option A is not an answer to the question. \n\nOption B \"I don't think I should worry about that\" is the most logical and straightforward answer but has no specific motivation -", "answer": "D: unhappy"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nIn this question, the only possible scenario for option A (play crossword puzzle) would be if the dictionary were part of a crossword puzzle. However, even then, it wouldn't help to \"do something with a dictionary\" in that situation.\n\nOption B (see art) makes sense if the dictionary contains images or illustrations alongside definitions and explanations. However, if the dictionary is purely text-based, it doesn't make sense to use it alongside to look at artwork.\n\nOption C (give up) is impossible, as the task of \"doing something with a dictionary\" would have already been completed. It can't be discarded or reversed at this point, nor can it be thrown away.\n\nOption D (grocery shop) is similarly inaccurate. The task of \"doing\" something with a dictionary does not involve shopping for food - the two concepts should not go together.\n\nOption E (play chess) is also out of place. Chess is a game that requires some form of thinking and planning, but analyzing the dictionary doesn't require those skills.\n\nThe final remaining option is \"play chess\". The dictionary can be used as a reference for words and phrases relevant to chess, and the game can be played using those terms. This helps to \"do\" something with a dictionary and can be used to alleviate boredom.\n\nSo the final answer would be E: play chess.\n\nInput:When I first started playing chess, I had a lot to catch up on. My instructor told me that in order to learn, I should focus on _____. Choices: A: strategies B: new tactics C: rules D: challenges E: mistakes\nOutput:Reasoning:\n\nAgain, we're looking at the context of the situation and the tasks involved.\n\nIn this case, \"strategies\", which would be gained from the experience and knowledge of the instructor, are likely what the student needs to catch up. \n\n\"New tactics\" (B), on the other hand, seem out of place - especially since the instructor says to focus on the student's strengths and what he's already good at.\n\n\"Rules\" (C) seem like an incorrect response, as the student will learn the rules", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nOption \"believe in god\" (B) would be reasonable if this was about a researcher examining the impact of people's religiosity on health. But if we're asking about an individual's general choices, it doesn't qualify. Similarly, \"stay in\" (D), while commonly used by certain individuals, isn't a universally common option. Similarly, \"watch movies\" (E) is reasonable to some degree, but it's unreasonable on the whole scale.\n\nThe only answer that remains is \"expect to die\" (A). People expect to die, which is why they choose to eat food that's easy to eat and digest. While this might not be as appealing as the other options, it's the most accurate choice because it fits the context of the question and answers what the writer is asking about.\nSo the answer is A: Expect to die\n\nInput:Who invented the internet? Choices: \n A: the US military B: the CIA C: China D: Bill Gates E: Stephen Hawking\nOutput: Reason\n\nThe option \"the US military\" (A) would make sense if this question was about a researcher looking for information about how data is gathered by organizations or governments. But that's not the question the writer is asking about - we're not talking about the methods of gathering data but about who made and discovered the internet. So we can eliminate this option.\n\nOption \"the CIA\" (B) makes sense because the CIA is a notorious organization known for its secret missions and operations. While it's true that the CIA has its hand in information gathering and data analysis, it doesn't feel relevant or credible when answering a question about the history of the internet.\n\n\"China\" (C) makes sense as a possible answer, but it's a rather generic country. That's why we can eliminate this option, too.\n\n\"Bill Gates\" (D) is out of the picture because that's just the name of a famous businessman. Aside from being unrelated to the topic at hand, it still wouldn't make sense in the context of this question because Microsoft's internet browser - Internet Explorer - didn't become commonplace until 1995, which is a few years after", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

If the prompt provided extra details (such as the snake's home country or its continent), then you would have more to go on than the mere fact that it was a cottonmouth and from where?\n\nThe next step is to eliminate irrelevant options. Here, the choice \"from where\" is irrelevant because the prompt only lists a single location - Georgia. However, options such as \"nature\" (D) and \"under the rocks\" (E) are irrelevant because they do not address a particular location at all.\n\nThe choice \"American\" (A) also falls into this category, as it is not tied to a particular location but rather gives a vague definition of the snake's species.\n\nThe final option is \"georgia.\" While this answer is relevant, it is not the best option because it only mentions the location of the snake, not its species.

Bouncing a ball against a target on a wall sounds like the scenario is taking place in the playroom - a place where children play and interact with their toys.\nOption \"closet\" (E) does not make sense here. The wording of the question mentions a target to be bounced against, suggesting that there is a spot where this happens. \n\nOption \"toy box\" (C) is incorrect because Billy bouncing against a wall implies him using the ball to hit the target against. This might also happen in a playroom, but it's not the only location where such an activity could take place. \n\nOption A, \"pool table\" (A), is incorrect because it's not even close to a possible location. \"Bouncing the ball off the wall\" can be interpreted as using the ball to hit something against the wall.

Hotels don't use shampoo.\n\nThe option \"at hotel\" (D) similarly doesn't make sense because hotels would not be buying shampoo in the first place.\n\nThe option that could be viable is shampoo bottles (C). Shampoo bottles are the place where one would use shampoo, as opposed to hotel rooms, where one would not be. This would be sufficient for the logic behind this question to align: \"going through a lot of it.\"\n\nThe other option \"hair saloons\" (E) is problematic since salons are not places where shampoo would be used as readily as a hotel or bottle would.\n\nSo the correct answer finally, is C: shampoo battles.\n\nIncorrect input / output:\n\nInput:The girl ran to school, she had trouble getting her homework done what?

The option \"live many years\" (E) is also incorrect because it contradicts the statement \"what would you normally expect a **cat** to say\".\n\nOption \"see king\" (A) could be a misinterpretation of the phrase \"a cat\". The writer may be attempting to say the phrase \"see king\" as a play on the phrase \"look at me\", which is also a cat-related phrase, used in an attempt to get attention from another human.

Also there is no other meaning to the word 'nation\" in the question. Now taking out all the confusing words such as 'in', 'part' and 'world', we have the core context \"Turkey is a country/nation.\"\n\nMoving on to the option D which says, \"A: asia minor B: asia C: provide meat D: balkan peninusla\", which are 4 geographical places mentioned in the question. The question asked for 'where' not 'what', therefore, these options will eliminate the question.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is A: Asia minor\n\nInput: How many hours is the length of light of a day? Choices:  B: 24 C: 24 hours D: 2 hours E: 216 hours\nOutput: Reason 1: The word 'length' in this question refers to the duration of time, therefore, it cannot be the correct option with respect to its meanings.\nReason 2: We can read antonyms of length in the dictionary:\n\nAntonyms of 'length'\nbriefness : shortness\nconcision : brevity : succinctness\nfewness : paucity : scantiness\nlimitation : restraint : shortage : restriction\nshortness : curtness : terse : abruptness\n\nSo all the choices given as answers, except for (D) would be wrong.\nThus, the correct answer is 'E': 216 hours.\n\n- Input: Which of the following is not a method used by managers?

But it is not as broad as asking to generalize about which country is famous for growing potatoes.\n\nSo, the options \"i'daho\" (A), \"Casserole\" (B) and, \"Root Cellar\" (C) are eliminated because they cannot answer the specific, narrow question.\n\nThe next step is to look on map to see if there is any European country in the potato industry. There is none. Thus, \"Ireland\" (D) is out since it is in North America, not in Europe.\n\nThe remaining two options are \"Italy\" (E) and \"France\" (F). Since \"F\" is missing on the above answer key, we can go ahead and eliminate it.\n\nWe can also rule out \"Italy\" (F) because it is not famous for its potato, and this question is specific to potato.\n\nTherefore, the answer is F, France or E, Ireland\n\nInput:How will you get to the other side?

{"text": "Reason:Reasoning:\n\nThis questions seems to be asking a trivia question based on a common phrase. The wording of this situation leaves open a number of possible outcomes.\n\nOption \"automobile accidents\" (C) doesn't seem to be a possible outcome. The fact that the person is inebriated doesn't imply that they'll be more likely to get in a car accident.\n\nOption \"drunk driving\" (D) seems to be too literal of an interpretation of the phrase \"lose control of your speech.\" Losing control of one's speech would indicate a tendency to say certain things, and then backtrack or correct oneself. This doesn't imply drunk driving.\n\nThe correct answer is (E): \"talk intelligently.\" The phrase \"lose control of speech\" is often used to describe someone who might slur their words or stutter. But that's not the only meaning of \"control of your speech.\" And thus, they would be saying that after being inebriated, a person will tend to speak in an intelligent and coherent fashion.\n\nInput:Which of the following is the most obvious inference that can be made about the above situation? Choices:  - A. She needs a new job. B. She might be interested in a job in marketing. C. They need her in finance. D. She is a good cook. E. They want her in finance.\nOutput: Reasonable: Reasoning: Reason:\n\nThere are multiple possible implications to be drawn from this situation. The job title \"Personal Chef\" implies that someone is being hired to cook for other people. That makes the logical choice \"A: She needs a new job\" unlikely (D).\n\nThe inference that she's a \"good cook\" (E) seems unlikely as well, as the context doesn't indicate why the chef is being hired in the first place.\n\nThe inference that the chef would be given a job in finance is also not supported by the text. The restaurant owner says, \"I've had such a lot of cooks lately, but this one really knows how to treat people right.\" The key phrase here is \"cook.\" That implies that the chef will still be working in the kitchen, which is a far cry from being given a position in upper management", "answer": "D: talking nonsense"}

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe phrase \"they want to reproduce\" implies the existence of desire in pursuing that action. That narrows the field of options to 3: 1) Eat ice cream, 2) have sex, 3) sit down.\nBut the question demands something the human body does (i.e. a physical act) rather than a non-physical act, such as wanting to reproduce.\n\nThen, what would a human do to reproduce?

The option \"boats\" is incorrect for the same reason.\nThe option \"Aircraft\" seems like a good choice, but it does come down - it land eventually on the runway during flight.\n\nIt left \"Sitting still.\" Now, that's an odd one. Whenever we sit down, we definitely come down. So how does sitting still fit the description?\nIt's about perspective. Sitting still is an unusual example of going up without coming down. If you sit down in a moving vehicle, such as a bus, you will go up a little bit, but then come down when the bus goes lower in altitude.\nBut if you sit still in one place, there's no other motion that causes you to come down. Therefore, there's no sense of up in the moment.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is indeed B: Sitting still!\n\nInput: I want: what will you give me? Choices:  C: You and me B: Sleeping  A: Help B: Hugs And kisses\nOutput: Reasonning:\n\nThe first clue is the use of the word \"I\" instead of \"we\" to refer to a collection of people. This indicates that the question applies to one person and that the answer should focus on what that one person wants.\nThe remaining options are all physical objects.

An inanimate object is not something that a person can interact with or describe in this manner. \nB: In this case, the sentence refers to a mathematical formula, such as \u2018adding\u2019.

That\u2019s because in a scientific/mathematical context, people can be replaced with the noun \u2018particles\u2019. For example, \u2018particles interact\u2019 or \u2018particles feel\u2019.   \n\nD: The answer would need to be something related to arithmetic.

{"text": "Reason:\nThere are three criteria on which an answer to this question can be judged: relevance, context-basedness and concreteness.\n\n1. Relevance:\n\nThe question invites you to reason that there are certain tasks that animals can \"only do if they were born to do it\". This phrase has a rather philosophical ring to it, and can be found all over TV commercials and other media.\n\nThus, it is important to focus on the connotations of the phrase \"doing something well\", which means that it implies mastery.\n\n2. Context-basedness:\n\nThe question asks us to explain what a certain type of animals does not do well. So, we can say with almost certainty that it is not \"doing something well\" - otherwise, they would not be bad at it.\n\n3. Concreteness:\n\nThe question also asks about activities that require a certain kind of \"know-how\". \"Swimming well\" here means that the animals are good at swimming, while \"passing water\" means passing urine. Since the question refers to swimming, we can say with certainty that it cannot be referring to the passing of urine.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is B: bathe.", "answer": "A: pass water"}

Besides, the context of the question refers specifically to the home.\n\nFinally: The only option that makes sense (other than the obvious \"electrical connection\" [A]) is \"wall\" (C).\nAnd if you do happen to stumble upon an \"electrical wire\" (B) during your search, it's still plausible for the user to look at the wall as well.\n\nThe final answer is D: Wall\n\nInput:What was the first thing he changed?

I know this because the first sentence of the question tells me so: \"Say you\u2019re George, you know\u2026 George to the rescue\u2026\"\nNow, the first question the user will ask is always the what. \"What was the first thing?\" This eliminates most irrelevant options (C, D, E).\nThe last part of the sentence (\"...to avoid being pursued by police\") indicates there's something relevant to pursuit in the story somewhere. This doesn't necessarily mean a crime was committed, but some form or pursuit must have occurred in order for the police to try to pursue George. This eliminates option B (his address).\nFinally, I know his hair color and shoe size are irrelevant because nowhere within this passage do I read the term \"hair\" or \"footwear.\"\nThe final answer, therefore, is A: his name\n\nInput:She took the test and she failed to pass because she failed to score at least 70.

{"text": "Reason:\n \nThe first step is to identify which word or phrase can be replaced so that each of options make sense. In this case, the word \"speech\" could be replace by either \"play\" or \"theater\".\n\nThe next step is to identify where the replaced word most likely exists in the context of the sentence. Both \"city\" (C) and \"theater\" (E) seem reasonable, since both are proper nouns representing a specific, geographically defined location. The only way of determining which is more likely is to identify when and why \"city\" or \"theater\" would be used in the sentence.\nHowever, \"theater\" (or \"play\") does not seem to be necessary here, because the sentence could still be correct without it: \"Jan went to the auditarium and listened to __ the __.\" Furthermore, \"somewhere\" (B) is also not necessary. The sentence would still be grammatically correct if \"somewhere\" was removed: \"Jan went to __ to listen\".\n\nTaking these considerations into account, \"theater\" is disqualified as an option, and \"somewhere\" is disqualified due to unnecessary wordiness. That leaves city vs. high school as possible substitutions.\n\nTo make a more definitive decision, one must analyze the context of the sentence in question, specifically the word \"auditorium\". Auditoriums are used only for plays, lectures, or similar events. That rules out all options except \"high school\" and \"city.\"\n\nThe last criterium aids in deciding. \"Jan ____ the auditorium\"; \"Jan ____; 'high school' doesn't make sense because then the sentence reads \"Jan went to high school to listen to a speech\" (which makes no sense), and \"somewhere\" would make it read \"Jan went to somewhere and listened to a speech\" (also not very informative).\n\nThus, the final option is \"high school\" (C): Jan went to the auditorum and listened to the speech.\"\n\nTherefore, high school makes more sense as the context of the sentence and it is a location so Jan went to high school and listened to the speech would be correct for the option C.", "answer": "B: high school"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nTo determine the answer to this question, you need to consider the context clues provided in the question. The word \"I,\" indicated that the \"I\" person is speaking in the first person, or referencing things done directly by themselves.

As the question makes clear, there are some items in the cellar (B) and other items in the grocery store (E). If the question is referring to a canned food drive at a business, then the grocery store does not make sense.\n\nOptions A and D do not make sense because they do not describe places where contributions would be stored, and the question does not refer to contributions as being in either location.

Choices:  C: go dancing B: walk around E: go back to the movie theater A: play tennis D: go swimming\nOutput: Reason\n\nIn order to find the answer to this question it's important to review the context clues that are given in the question. The most important clue is given in the question when the narrator mentions that the \"they\" person is going to see a movie with \"some friends.\" This implies that the group, or at least some of the group, has been watching a movie.\n\nIn the options, we are given some possibilities of what to do after the movie. One possibility is to walk around (B), but we are told that the \"they\" has already done this, but wants to do something else.\n\nAnother option is to go back to the movie (A), but this does not make sense since it is inconsistent with the \"they\" person's desire to see a movie with friends. It would only makes sense for them to return if there was something wrong with the movie they were already sitting in. A better option to choose is option E.\n\nAnother possible option is to pick option C. This would seem plausible, but it is not consistent with the \"they\"'s desire", "answer": "E: grocery store"}

If we were lying while waiting for the bus, we wouldn't be able to read.\n\nOption B - makes more sense.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThis is a tricky question because most of the options are plausible, which allows for a multitude of interpretations.\nEliminating irrelevant words/topics helps to focus in on the task at hand.\n\nOption B (resentment) does not accurately describe what spectators are looking for in this scenario. It's unclear whether they are looking to resent a certain team or individual. Additionally, it is not uncommon for spectators to show admiration and appreciation for a team's skills.\n\nOption E (two winners) is incorrect because the teams were evenly matched, which means they are likely to split the winnings, implying there will be one overall winner.\n\nOption D (winning or losing) does not accurately capture the scenario either because spectators aren't necessarily looking to see who wins or loses, but rather how it happens and who wins.\n\nThat leaves option A (envy) and E (better understanding).\nOf the two, option A (envy), is the only one that would fit the scenario.\nSo the final option would be A: envy\n\nInput:Why did the woman feel disappointed she hadn't seen that episode (of her favorite program)?

The relevant fact that gives away the correct answer is what comes before the question (in the first paragraph).\n\nIt's important to remember how the question is worded and to think outside the box when it comes to answering. For example, the answer \"disappointed\" (D) doesn't specifically reference a future state, nor does it make much sense in context. If she was disappointed, it's hard to imagine she wouldn't have known about it beforehand.

{"text": "Reasonning:\n\nOption \"E: south pacific ocean\" is the best choice.\n\nJohnny is already in the'south western' part of the Americas, so 'near America' would mean 'anywhere north of south America'.

Choices:  A. mobile phone B. wristwatch C. desktop computer D. laptop E. office\nOutput: Reason\n\nThe main task is to understand that the teenager isn't \"like *every* other\" in terms of her use of a mobile phone. Since she's playing on her iPhone and has likely bought one, we can reasonably assume a smart phone is in her hand.\n\nOption A is the most logical choice for the teenager's phone - \"a mobile phone\" - and option B (\"wrist watch\") is an obvious answer that doesn't fit the given facts.\n\nWith this narrowed down, the next step is to reason out what the phone represents. Since the phone is new, we can infer that the teenage girl has access to one - which means it's a \"pure\" phone, not a smart watch or a desktop computer.\n\nWith this in mind, the only options left are D and E.

Thus, the answer option \"court action\" (D) is ruled out.\n\n\"Anger\" is the answer we're looking for. It is the only option that perfectly fits the context of civil action - that is, as a result of anger. Option \"trial\" (E) is related to anger but is irrelevant to the problem at hand. \"Complications\" (A) isn't as emotional as anger and is not a factor in instituting civil action.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to other options. \"Tiredness\" is not an adequate emotion to institute civil action, and \"B \" is inappropriate in this context. This makes \"anger\" (D) the only applicable answer.\nSo the final choice is A: anger\n\nInput: Who is the man behind Dollar's dollar menu? Choices: 1. Aaron 2. Jeff 3. Seth 4. Steve 5.

The context of this question also suggests that the fishing rod is essential enough to merit frequent shopping at multiple locations.\n\nChoice A (\"furniture store\") would certainly be an option if you were looking to buy a fishing rod, but it doesn't seem very reasonable under the present circumstances as stated in the question.\n\nChoices B and C (\"fishing camp\" and \"sporting goods store\") are both plausible, but neither \"sporting goods\" nor fishing activities would be found exclusively in just one of the places (e.g., there is no rule that a certain type of sporting goods must be sold in a camp or vice versa).\n\nThe best answer is Choice D (\"hardware store\"), which is the one place you can buy a (pretty much) anything. A hardware store sells everything from sporting gear to furniture to fishing rods, to car engines.\n\nInput:What did they bring me? Choices:  B: sushi C: pizza D: tacos E: a box\nOutput:Reasonning:\nThe second half of the question (\"I said I wanted...\") is vague, so we know that there probably wasn't a \"they\" who brought the subject anything.

But we also know from what he said that the box was brought to him, so that means it would have had to come from someone else. So if it was the subject's friend, that'd be \"we.\"\n\nThe word \"box\" is fairly vague in nature, and could mean nearly anything.

To confirm this, we can visit any online dictionary. A search on Google for 'what language do the books of the Bible appear in?' yields the following results:\n\"The original books of the Hebrew Bible generally appeared in Hebrew or Aramaic. Only the New Testament was written in Greek. The original books of the Old Testament were translated from Hebrew to Greek between 250 and 200 BC, and were compiled to produce the Septuagint in Greek.

Choices:  a) they feel sick.    b) their heart pumps faster    c) they can start smoking d) their metabolisms decline   e) they gain weight\nOutput: Answer is b, Their heart pumps faster. Because eating too much fast food cause obesity or gain weight of course. Then they will start to feel sick if they keep eating fast food. They also may start smoking when being under pressure. This because their heart pumps faster. And their metabolisms declines over time because their heart pumps too fast.

John seems to be genuinely concerned about his relationship and wants to know if it can be saved.\nLet\u2019s examine each choice to see if any of them are relevant.\nChoice I is a non sequitur, as it\u2019s irrelevant that he can trust anyone in his life if he and his gf are no longer interested in being together.\nChoice II is not a problem to look into unless John truly intends to explore his ex\u2019s dating preferences which, in context would be inappropriate and unnecessary.\nChoice III also is not relevant as we\u2019re searching for a question, not an observation. Choice IV, however, does seem to hint at something to ask John\u2019s girlfriend, and is reasonable in context\u2014even if she doesn't like being alone, she isn\u2019t going to go through life with John, so to a degree they\u2019re in the same boat.

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nOption (A) states that these people took the scenic route because they wanted \"to cut through the countryside\".\nThis choice of wording makes no sense in the context of this problem statement.

The scenic route may be intended to take some time, but it wouldn't be considered to be \"taking a tour\" in the traditional sense of the term - meaning it would not be a planned out travel experience.\n\nAnswer (D) states that the people choses to take the scenic drive because they wanted \"to be able to drive through the atlas\".\nThis is also poorly worded, as the \"atlas\" mentioned here is just a reference to an actual world map with geographical features - it isn't really \"driving through\" anything.\n\nOption (B) states that \"they chose the highway that cuts through the U.S.\".\nThis answer is correct, as it implies that they chose this route to \"cut through\" the united states, which is what they wanted to do.\n\nOption (E) states that they chose to take the scenery tour because they wanted to \"cut through the developed nations land\".\nThis is another example of poor wording. The concept of \"cutting through\" a nation might seem like it would make sense, but in reality it doesn't.

It is plausible that the riders were going to experience heartburn, but they were talking specifically about eating or having food poisoning. So this answer will be eliminated. \nNext, there are no reasons to choose 'A' or 'B' as the riders would have most likely not to eat hamburgers. They are probably going to enjoy eating at some of themesed restaurants at the Disney theme parks instead. Additionally, they already did eat, so they would definitely not be going to eat again.\n\nIt is also probable that they would not have asked for B as well because they already were experiencing fun at the theme parks. Choice C (to enjoy) is plausible and should be considered. However, this does not clearly state the outcome of when they would have gone through a ride. We can see that the riders are probably going to enjoy the future activities, but this doesn't tell us whether they are currently enjoying. So the answer choice should be C.\n\nLastly, we are left with two options, C and D. One would reasonably assume that D wouldn't hold much truth either. We can only assume that they were going to have fun. They have to be going through the rides because they wanted 'fun' and the rides at Disney were meant to be fun experiences. We can't say that the rides would have given them food poisoning; again, they could have very well said \"I feel a bit sick after that ride.\" But as the sentence reads, we can assume that they discussed about food poisoning.

{"text": "Why: \n\nThe first task in solving this question is to understand the context in which a person might be \"looking at some things which can not move\". The context involves something moving, but not doing so. This implies that the person could be looking at cars moving on a race track. \n\nOption \"surface of the earth\" (C) is incorrect, as cars cannot move on the surface of the earth. Option \"football stadium\" (A) is incorrect as things in the football stadium could not possibly move because there is nothing for them to move to. \n\nSo, the \"car show\" (D) is incorrect, as well since not everything that moves in a car show is physically moving on a racetrack (such as those that are merely displayed). Option \"movie\" (E) is plausible because it is possible to view something, such as actors, on a screen, but not really move, in the same way that a car is not physically moving on a race track at a car show, but can still be observed. So the final answer is E.\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the  following multiple choice question.", "answer": "C: car show"}

There are options such as \"shopping malls\" (C) and \"airport\" (D), which might seem like plausible answers at first glance. However, these aren't specific enough to be correct. For example, \"shopping mall\" technically covers a wide variety of places. In addition, \"shopping bags\" wouldn't be an appropriate accessory in an airport.\n\nAll the remaining options (\"amusement park\" (A), \"urban area\" (B), and \"train station\" (E)) make sense in the context of a shopping mall or shopping parking lot. While each answer could be reasonably given for the right reasons, the correct answer is (C): airport, because the shopping bags are probably being carried to bring back objects purchased at the mall.\nSo the final correct answer is C: airport\n\nInput: Which of the following is an example of a noun? Choices: \nA: a book, a car, a table, a box\nB: candy, gum, apples, pears\nC: mango, pineapple, papaya, mango\nD: chocolate, marshmallow, gumdrop, chocolate\nOutput: Reason:\n\nFirst of all, we need to know what a noun is. Nouns refer to inanimate objects - things that don't move or do more than the usual function for their kind. Nouns generally do not express quantity.\n\nThe question choices represent various quantities of inanimate objects. \n\n\"Book, a car\" (A) is a phrase in the English language, but it doesn't convey any of the characteristics of a noun, so it isn't correct.\n\n\"Candy, gum, and apple\" (B) are all nouns that refer to various fruits, but since the fruits cannot be counted or compared, it isn't correct\n\n\"Apples, pears, and mangoes\" (C) are all words that denote multiple fruits.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe question \"What did he shoot at\" can be broken down into a question \"Who or What was James shooting\". But \"Who was James shot at\" could be an answer for question \"What did he shot\"; so it could also be interpreted as \"Who or What was being shooter\".\n\nHere, choices of A and C do not fit the scenario. Choices of A and B do not fit the scenario but they could fit in a different context. Similarly, Choices of B and D do not fit the scenario, but they could fit in different context. Therefore, the least likely choice should be picked out from the remaining ones. \"Body armor\"(B) is the least likely to answer the question. The remaining choices do not fully fit the scenario nor are they likely answer. \n\nThe question is \"What James shot at\" not \"Who or What was shooter\". James is the only shooter in the situation, and was shooting at an animal (E). So the final answer is E\n\nInput:The wolf, who was dressed in goat skin, approached the sheep.

That means you should only consider animals.\n\nHowever, none of the options are explicitly for animals. One is for pollination (B and D) which occurs to plants rather than animals. Other is about love (E), which is an abstract concept and the question explicitly states that it's about creatures. \n\nSo it's safe to ignore the \"action\" (C) and the \"happiness\" (E), because they aren't relevant to the answer.\n\nSince the question is about creatures, there's only one option that fits this context - that is option \"b\". \n\nThe next task to tackle is whether the choice is singular or plural. The answer must be singular since the question uses \"one animal\", so you should only choose the single possible option from a list. \n\nSo the final answer here is \"B: one action\"\n\nInput:What do the people of the country want to see and hear?Choices:  A: a president B: a newspaper C: news media D: a tv station E: radio\nOutput: Reason for Answer: \n\nThis question is looking for an abstract noun that describes people's interests.

For this type of question, it is helpful to remember that each set of options needs to be mutually exclusive. \n\nThis is because the question is posing four options and asks which one does not belong, so the options need to all be unique and unrelated in meaning.

Option D is incorrect because the three races which make up the triple crown is the derby, so it would make sense that the biggest crowds would be gathering at the derby. Option B, the kentucky derby is a specific event in the triple crown, so the option can be dropped. \n\nOnly three options remain: Option A, the horse derby, Option C, the american southwest and Option E, the triple crown.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThe first step in answering this question is to identify the term with which the question is referencing. The answer can only be one of two options: \"state of union,\" from which the \"of union\" portion can be deducted, or \"each country.\"\n\nNext, the question refers to a \"capital\" (A), but it's unclear whether the question is referring to individual capital cities or capital in a broader sense. The word \"capital\" is more commonly used to refer to the country or government, such as \"the capital of the United States\" or \"capital of France.\"\n\nIf \"the state of union\" is referring to the speech itself, then the first option is incorrect. That eliminates the \"state of union\" from contention.\n\nIf it's referring to the speech that takes place in the capital, then the last option is incorrect, because it does not take place in a capital city. The \"union\" refers to a country, not a speech. Now only four options remain: each state, each country, state of union, and each country. But that narrows down by removing each state, state of union, which refers to a speech. So the answer is each country.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions with the right choice.\n\nInput: What letter on the keyboard do you type to copy text?

On the contrary, it is being used to denote the letter C (that is, the 'C' key on the keyboard), which is the first letter of the alphabet, and used on the keyboard to type the letter C. The only answer choice that meets this condition is a. We can thus eliminate the other options, which are: b: 'v', c: 'x', d: 'z', and e: '2'.\n\nInput: What does a 180 mile an hour train sound like?

{"text": "Solution:\n\nThe word \"knack\" in the sentence suggests a talent or skilled ability. That immediately eliminates options \"fun\" (A) and \"learn about\" (B).\nAdditionally, the word \"entertaining\" in the sentence indicates the focus is on performing or putting on a show. Thus, options \"intelligence\" (D) and \"recognize\" (E), which refer to qualities like being intelligent or being able to recognize something, are unnecessary.\n\nThe last task is to narrow down exactly what kind of talent the woman has; she possesses skills that make her a \"natural\" at performing or providing entertainment.\n\nOption \"talent\" (C) fits that description, so it is the best choice. The sentence would read like this: She had a natural talent for entertaining her audience.\nSo, the final answer is C: talent \n\nInput:She got the message she'd seen that people were talking about how they could see for miles on the clear day.So she just took a deep breath because what? Choices: B: It was going to snow A: The sky in a different color D: People were upset E: They had seen the clouds\nOutput: Solution: \n\nThe word \"just\" in the sentence indicates a recent or instantaneous action. That immediately leads us to eliminate option \"A: It was going to rain (B). \"A little less talking\" in the lyrics is a recurring phrase throughout the song, so option \"B\" (A) does not fit here, as it would mean that the lyrics are referring to something that isn't occurring in the storyline.\n\nWe can eliminate option \"D\" because while people seeing clouds might be described as something that's been \"seen in a different color\" (D), it doesn't necessarily mean they're taking a deep breath.\n\nBecause she can see for miles on the \"clear day\" (C), then option \"C\" could be the case.\nInput: The police were investigating the case and they had never saw something like that.

{"text": "Reason:\n\nIn this scenario, the floor does constitute off the floor, because floors are, literally, \"off the floor.\" \"Off the floor\" in this case is a modifier for \"floor,\" which indicates it is next to the floor. With that context clued into place, it should be evident that the options with floor are not valid responses. \n\nSimilarly, option B, \"closet,\" could plausibly be read to mean \"in the closet,\" but because that description doesn't match what the sentence states, that would indicate closet did not refer to the closet.\n\nNow the remaining options are valid based solely on their meanings, such as \"cabinet\" (D) - it's a piece of furniture found on the ground.\n\nIf the correct answer was \"soccer game,\" the sentence would read \"Dave put his beers where he could get to them, but it would be at the soccer game.\" There is no context cluing that \"soccer game\" refers to where the beer is put. There's another way that could happen, especially if option D were \"garage.\" \"At the soccer game\" and \"at the garage\" would then have to be taken as metaphorical placements for the beers. So, if \"At the soccer field\" could have validly been \"At the football field of dreams,\" then \"soccer game\" could potentially indicate that the beer could have gone anywhere. \n\nThis scenario also highlights how important the structure of a question is, because it is often how we decide to interpret an answer. Without that, it could just as likely read \"A: at the floor B: in the closet C: at the can\" and we wouldn't know that \"off the floor\" refers to the \"floor\" being put onto something next to it, instead of that it refers to the actual floor-level surface.\n\nIf the question were written, \"Dave put his drinks near the floor, but it was on the ground. Where did he put them?\" this would be a different matter: the meaning conveyed by the structure is clear that \"floor\" would refer to an above-ground surface.\n\nInput: Where does the average citizen go for the best food?

Someone who buys gifts isn't necessarily wealthy, so \"having money\" (D) is too general a description of a gift-bearing person.\n\nThat leaves the answer to be \"generous\" - which implies that one is spending money on others, the exact activity required to buy gifts.\nSo the final option is E: generous.

{"text": "Reasonning:\n\nThe first step to answer this question is to determine what exactly is happening.\n\nThe option \"she kept her leg bouning\" (B) is incorrect because \"keeping\" implies continuous movement. If it was \"kept and then bouncing\", that would make sense, but \"bouncing\" doesn't convey any action that she might have taken.\n\nThe option D, \"grand piano,\" is another possibility. The answer, \"spinning wheel,\" can be interpreted as a musical reference, and in the scenario, the object that the girl is operating is what we would call in the U.S. a \"spinning wheel\", which is similar to a \"spinning mop\" or \"spinning brush\" in the context of cleaning your home.\n\nThe options \"hospital bed\" (A) and \"she was processing the wool\" (C) are more likely the answers. However, none of these options imply what she was doing while using the \"spinning wheel\" or a \"hospital bed,\" so they are irrelevant to answering the question. \n\nIn answer to the question, the final answer is D: grand piano\n\nInput: You have a broken machine, what are you doing in such a case?

That being said, the definition includes \"play,\" which isn't necessary, so we can choose this.\nThen, let's check Arsenic (5). The definition includes \"medicine,\" which isn't in the list of answers, so we can't choose this one.\nThen, let us check Altocumulus (2).

{"text": "Reason:\n\nThink about the definition of a village.\nA village is a small human settlement which typically consists of a cluster of houses.\nA village differs from a city in that it is not large enough to qualify as a city. Usually, a village consists of one or two neighborhoods.\nThink of the opposite of a village. A town would be the opposite of a village, which is another settlement with a small number of houses.\n\nTo decide that a \"town\" would be the opposite of \"a village,\" you should consider what the word \"opposite\" means. To find the opposite of a word, you should identify the antonym. An antonym is the opposite of a word.\nIn this case, you see that the \"opposite\" is used in the word \"oppositeness,\" so you should look for an antonym in \"oppositeness.\" You can find antonyms by using the Thesaurus.\n\nAfter using the Thesauris, you can find the phrase \"oppositeness\" on page 8. The opposite of a village is a town, and you can confirm this in your own dictionary if you like.\n\nInput: What does an astronaut eat in space?

Choice A and B are incorrect, because they give you enough ingredients to make less than 3 meals. What meal would you make? Choices:  C: salmon with mushrooms D: foul with peppers E: sardines with garlic F: meatballs with salt\n\nOutput: Answer: F. Answer: F. There are eight meal options (A-I) listed along the top row with 3 columns of meal options listed below, with 2 choices per row and column. The number of meals (from left to\nright, from top to bottom) that can be made in each row or column is\nlisted on those cells, with \u201c2 or greater\u201d indicated by a red dot. The number of ways you could make any of the eight meals from the top row is 2 (that is, there are 2 ways to make each of these 8 meals). The number of ways you can make a meal from among the 2 meals listed on the left column is 3 (so, there are 3 different ways to make a choice from the 2 meals there). The number of ways to make a meal listed in the 3 left columns is (4 x 3) x 2 =  144. These numbers can easily be subtracted to find that there are 44 meals that cannot be made by the ingredients provided.\n\n\n### Input: There are two kinds of fruit trees that grow on the farm, apples and cherries.

If someone has a low account balance, the response they'd receive would likely be an email, or something similar, not a phone call.\n\nWe know that option \"Wow\" (A) is not correct, because the sentence implies that the respondent has already attempted online banking and has succeeded, not failed. \n\nThe phrase \"I'm sorry but...\" (D) is a correct response, but it's already implied that someone is having trouble with online banking, so we need the option's phrase to be more specific.\n\nOnly \"Can you email me some more information about it\" (B) remains as a viable answer.

Choices: A: honesty, compassion, integrity B: empathy, kindness, sincerity C: patience D: all of the above\nOutput: Reason\n\nReasoning:\nWhen we understand the context of the sentence, we note that 2 characteristics are mentioned \"empathy\" and \"kindness\". From the context, kindness is the opposite of the quality \"manipulative\", this means that kindness (option D) is the correct answer.\n\nInput: During a sales pitch the restaurant owner should appear what in order to make a good impression on the visitor?

The phrase \"to make a good impression\" suggests that the meeting is not necessarily about closing a deal, but it does imply that the intent is to get something out of it.\n\nThe options that can be eliminated are", "answer": "B: charming"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nTo get to the final answer - E: Trauma, you must first understand the context and purpose of the action.\n\nThe first task of the context analysis is to understand the action. In this case, there are two tasks - the first of which is to use their previous successes to inspire them. It is clear that they are motivated by previous successes, and this inspires them to act, so we can eliminate any other motivations.\n\nNext, you must determine what the action is. Remembering past successes, while important for inspiration, is not sufficient for the purpose because it does not tell us whether this causes inspiration or stress.\nTherefore, the correct option is going to be E; because remembering past successes causes trauma.\n\nInput:When a doctor takes the temperature of a patient, the thermometer is used to measure A: how hot the patient is B: the patient's level of sickness C: how cold the patient is D: the patient's health E: the patient's age\nOutput:Reasoning:\n\nTo get the final answer, you must first complete the context and purpose analysis.\n\nThe context is quite straightforward to understand. In the context, the thermometer is \"something used to measure\" something.\nThis tells us that the thermometer, or the object in the context, is something used to measure, and therefore the correct answer is going to be \"A\" - \"how hot\" the patient is.\n\nFrom there, the options then tell us what \"how hot\" the thermometer is used for. For options B and C, it's quite clear that this phrase doesn't make a lot of sense, as they both don't represent the object in the context. Option D is possible, but we already know that \"how hot\" the patients is going to be the correct option.\n\nFinally Option E has been eliminated because it doesn't match the context. It isn't reasonable to use a thermometer to measure the patient's age, so we can eliminate Option E as the correct choice.\n\nThe answer is going to be A \"how hot\" the patiet is\n\nInput:According to the scientific method, an observation is usually the first step that is carried out when conducting a scientific experiment.  This step is referred to as A: hypotheses B: a question C:", "answer": "C: inspiration"}
{"text": "Reason:\n\nA corner is defined as being at an inside angle at the corner of the outside wall. If a corner has lots of windows, it means that a lot of natural light is entering the space, which would result in higher rent costs. Rent costs are the lowest in the front of the office building, because it is most visible from the street. Corner offices typically also have higher rent cost, because they are exposed to natural light. \n\nThe tent has two windows facing each other. This scenario is unlikely, so we can disregard it. \n\nOption \"wall\" (A) is incorrect because there are no windows on the wall. Option \"office\" (B) and option \"space shuttle\" (D) only contain one window each, so they also don't fit. Option \"front door\" (C) is too vague to be definitive - it could refer to the front door of an office, or the front door of a house, or even the front door of the entire building. We can't discount it because some corner offices may have access to the front door, so a specific front door would not be considered a corner area. Finally, option \"tent\" (E) has two windows - one on each wall. Therefore, this satisfies the requirement of \"tons of windows\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: \"office\"\n\nInput:Why is there so little red matter?

If the goal is to improve efficiency, not as much as there was used to be would probably be inefficient for the following reasons: \n\n1. It takes up more space than there used to be (option B). \n\n2. It makes the sentence sound redundant. Reducing the amount of something (ie: red matter) is probably something you should try to avoid.\n\n3. It lacks structure and concision.

As a result, it is a natural choice for the name of a software application that runs on mobile devices to interact with their user interface.\n\nWindows is not a mobile operating system, and it is instead designed to run on computers, laptops, and other personal computers. While it does include some features that can be used on mobile devices, it is not designed specifically for mobile use and its user interface is not designed to be used in a manner that is consistent with the user interface of mobile devices.\n\nSafari is a web browser developed by Apple that is designed to run on iOS devices, such as iPhones and iPads. It is not a general-purpose application development platform, and thus would not be a natural choice for the naming of a software application that works with the user interface of a mobile device.\n\nChrome is not a dedicated mobile operating system and does not function in the same way as Windows or Safari. It is, rather, a web browser application that runs on a variety of devices, including laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. While Chrome may be used concurrently on a mobile device and on a desktop or laptop computer, it cannot be said to run as a \"front end\" application on a mobile device, and therefore is not a contender for the naming of a mobile-oriented software application.\n\niPhone is not a software application but rather is a specific type of computing device, as Apple itself states on its website at Apple dot com. \"iPhone is a revolutionary mobile phone that is a breakthrough in the mobile phone industry.\"\n\n\n## Instruction: Answer the", "answer": "E: laundry room"}

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nLet's look at what all the options mean to get an exact wording.\n\nOption A: It states \"fatigue\", though \"tiredness\" would be more accurate. However, this option goes out of context - the question was actually asking us what benefit we get from exercising. Tiredness does not give us a \"benefit\", so it goes out of context and is eliminated.\n\nOption B: Option B states \"relaxation\", which is good - that's exactly what we want from exercising.

However, \"holding\" would require only one hand, leaving the other free to pick up the object or otherwise move the hand around.\n\n\"Lift\" (B) would be the correct option in a context where competitors were doing some form of aerial work. In the context of this scenario, lifting is the opposite of holding the object, and it doesn't fit the physical requirement of arm extended.\n\n\"Hold onto\" (C) likewise does not meet the requirements of the competition. Although both hands can be used to hold the object, they would have to be positioned on the object, rather than extended straight out, which would cause the competitor to drop the object.\n\nThus, the most accurate answer would be \"extending\". \n\nInput: It was a big family reunion, everyone brought what? Choices: A: their favorite dish B: their favorite pet C: their favorite dessert D: their favorite child E: their favorite books\nOutput:Reasonings:\n\nSince everyone in the family reunion brought something, the answer to the question is likely to be something related to \"dishes.\"\n\nOptions \"favorite pet\" (B), \"favorite child\" (D), and \"favorite books\" (E) are ruled out as well, since it sounds like people brought a dish and not their favorite pet, child, or book.\n\nOption \"favorite dish\" (A) might be the best answer, but we can do better. Let's narrow it down to the dish itself. If we add in the context of other things people brought, we can eliminate options \"desserts\" (C) and \"dessert\" (D). Dessert isn'", "answer": "A: holding"}
{"text": "Reason: This is an interesting question that requires critical thinking and the ability to understand the context. The primary purpose of a bus station is to facilitate the exchange of passengers between buses, making it necessary that it be in a location that is easily accessible to those using the bus service.\n\nThe four remaining options are all unsuitable. Maps (B) provide information but don't indicate where the bus station is located, the buses (C) operate from the station, and the city centre (D) could describe multiple locations depending on the region.\n\nFinally we have the option \"at school\" (E) which doesn't provide a clear definition of where the bus station is, or specify why this is a \"convenient\" location.\nOf the remaining options, the best answer is \"school\" because this makes sense both logically and culturally in that a bus station must be accessible to the citizens who will be using it, so it must be situated conveniently in a location that can facilitate such access.\nSo the final answe is E: school\n\nInput:What might a teacher do to reduce noise in a classroom? Choices:  Answers:  A: turn the noise down  B: tell everyone to be quiet  C: make them more comfortable D: find a new school  E: give a warning\nOutput: Reason : The teacher in question will likely utilize various methods to maintain order among the students and control the level of noise within the classroom. One such method would be for the teacher to simply instruct the students to \"turn the noise down,\" which would clearly indicate to them where the source of the noise is coming from and emphasize the importance of reducing or eliminating it altogether. \n\nOption A, \"turn the noise down,\u201d appears to be an overly simplistic answer. The choice also doesn\u2019t fully explain why or how the teacher intends to have the student reduce the noise, providing no explanation or rationale for what they should do or how they should go about doing it.\nOption B, \"tell everyone to be quiet,\" seems somewhat appropriate, but it fails to justify how this activity would reduce the level of noise in the classroom in addition to instructing students explicitly to be quiet\nOption C, \"making them more comfortable,\" seems like an out-of-place option that is too vague and unexplained\nOption D, \"finding a new", "answer": "D: city centre"}

Choices:  - 1. An animal's preference for company - 2: Size of the group - 3: A group of a same sized animals - 4. Where an animal naturally exists - 5. A group of animals that are a threat to another group\nOutput: Reason::- We are given three groups of animals: a \u201cpack\u201d is made up of wolves, lynxes, and some other types of predators. This leaves as possible terms \u201csize\u201d, \u201cthreat\u201d, and the other word. This means that an animal naturally occurring in a pack of wolves, lions, and other predators is more likely to survive. This answer is probably right because if you look at a definition of a \"Flock\", you would find that birds are naturally found in groups.\n\nInput: What do all the animals that are going to be in a \"pack\" have in common with each other? Choices: 1. They are very loyal to one another - 2. They are of the same size - 3. They are of the identical species - 4. They all like to eat the same things - 5. They can hunt together as a pack\nOutput: Reason:- We are told that a \"pack\" is a group of wolves and other predatory animals. This means that all of the animals in the pack, including wolves and other lynxes, have each other's \"best interest at heart.\"\n\nInput: Which one of the following is not what you can do at a car dealership to save time and money?

{"text": "To \"buy\" a teddy bear is a relatively common colloquialism, and so this question can be understood to be asking for the place someone would go in order to buy a teddy bear.\n\nThe options \"thrift store\" (A) and \"home\" (E) are both correct, because they both describe a place where someone could purchase a teddy bear. They differ in that thrift store (A) means \"to sell secondhand goods\", while home (E) refers to \"the place where someone lives\".\n\nThe option \"shelf\" (D) does not apply to the question. \"Shelf\" is typically used to indicate a place to store food items or other items, not a place to buy them. Therefore, this would not be an appropriate option for this question.\n\nThe option \"bed\" (B) is incorrect because it does not refer to a specific place where one could go to buy a toy. It is more general, and could indicate that someone would purchase a teddy bear at any time. Therefore, this would also be incorrect.\n\n\n\nInput:What can a person do but not understand?Choices:  A: do math B: drink C: play D: speak E: act\nOutput: Reason:\n\nThe phrase \"do something but not understand it\" makes little sense from a grammatical standpoint. This is because \"doing something\" and \"understanding\" are both activities, meaning this phrase essentially implies that doing something will somehow negate its own activity, which is contrary to how grammar usually works.\n\n\nThe question can be interpreted in multiple ways, such as the person cannot understand themselves or cannot understand what the person was doing.\n\nBoth answer-options A and B seem logical and simple as the 1st part of the question. However, \"the person can never understand anyone else\" is not entirely true as he/she can at least understand oneself.\n\nAnswers C and E are also not plausible as the question does not suggest any activity or object that a person can do.\n\nSo the answer is B: drink\n\nInput: Why does a chicken crossing the road?

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nIn English, we use the expression \"to pack something,\" which is what option (A) is referring to. As a result, we can eliminate the term \"to packaged.\"\nMoreover, the prefix \"pack\" implies action, while the prefix \"faithful\" implies character. So (C) is obviously incorrect.\n\nOption (B) suggests binding papers in a way that they do not fall apart, or otherwise become broken or lose structure.\nThat said, the definition of \"binding\" suggests holding or securing something together, not breaking it apart. As such, the sentence \"so you use binding\" in the context of \"holding papers together\" is illogical and impossible to understand.\n\nSimilarly, \"compact\" is used to describe a small amount of space being occupied. It is used as an adjective when one is discussing the size or shape of something. The term would be misleading if applied literally to what one does when arranging loose papers.\n\nThe final remaining option \"to compact,\" in contrast, fits perfectly. When compacting loose papers, we apply pressure such that they are held in position and made firm, thereby preventing them from falling away.\nSo the final correct answer is D: faithful compact.\n\nInput: What do we make funeral arrangements for?

B: cemeteries and memorial day 5. C: services or memorial celebration 6. D: memorial parks and ceremonies\nOutput: Reason:\n\nWe can eliminate options D and E by looking at their context. Option D doesn't refer to funeral arrangements, but instead to memorial parks, which are a place for people to commemorate a deceased relative.\nOption E refers to services, but does not make it clear whether they are funerals or memorials.\n\nTherefore, we can immediately eliminate options (C) and (F). We can also eliminate option (A) because it refers to burials or funerals - the opposite of what the question is asking.\n\nAs a", "answer": "C: bound"}
{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nThis question is fairly basic, but it's important to remember that the context of the question should be taken into account when choosing the correct option. \n\nOption A: \"information\" (A) is a fairly general term for knowledge and data. However, it is usually associated with a sense of authority or ownership. \n\nOption B: \"exchange of ideas\" (B) is more specifically related to how new knowledge is shared and acquired. This option is thus a more precise way of describing what goes on in the brainstorming process.\n\nOption C: \"share information\" (C) is another vague and general option that is neither specific enough nor indicative of the main task of brainstorming.\n\nOption D: \"conversation\" (D) falls somewhere between the vague, general option C and the precise, context-specific B. The fact that information is being shared between people makes it a relatively good option. However, again, it lacks a specific quality that is indicative of the brainstorming setting.\n\nFinally we get to Option E: \"gathers of information\". Being very specific and specific to the task of brainstorm, this option clearly shows the true purpose behind the session.\n\nSo there we have it, the final answer is E\n\nInput: The scientists working in the laboratories had no problems because?  Choices: A: they were well prepared  B: they had a clear target  C: they were good in their studies D: they had good lab equipment E: all of the things\nOutput:Reason:\n\nAgain, the first order of business is to understand the context. So after learning that the scientists were at some kind of laboratory, the fact that they had \"no problems\" (B) is clear proof that they were doing what they wanted - and thus being successful at what they were doing. \n\nFurthermore, the question itself is vague - \"what's the problem?\" - leading us to think that there actually might be a problem that has not yet been identified. However, this is not the case, because the scientists clearly state that they have no problems.\n\nOption A: While it's true that they're at the lab, what do they have to do with their studying? The question has nothing to do with their level of preparation. So this is a dead", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

{"text": "Reason: The question is asking what distinguishes the rosebush from other types of bushes. The word \"along\" could indicate any feature or characteristic of the plant to be identified. \n\nThe most common feature of a rosebush is its color. The question is asking about a rosebush specifically, so an incorrect response that isn't specific to roses, such as \"flowers\" (B) or \"stem\" (C), would be incorrect.\n\nThis leaves us with four correct responses: park (A), in the ground (D), hedgerow (E), and botanical gardens (E). However, the two most likely correct responses are park (A) and in the ground (D). Park (A) is the only correct response that directly references roses; in the ground (D) is the only wrong response that directly references rosest. Both of these responses describe physical properties of the actual bush itself - the color (parks generally have them) and its location in the ground.  \n\nSince it's likely that the question was phrased to be as concise as possible, it wouldn't be uncommon for it to simply ask what the rosebush is \"in\" without explicitly stating that the bush should be identified as a rosebush. Therefore, in the ground (D )is the correct answer.\n\nInput: What is the weight of a person's heart? Choices: 1.1 kg, 1 A. A. kg, 10 A. A. kg 2 kg (C) 2000 lbs.

{"text": "Reasoning:\n\nThis question is similar to the previous one, in that both include a scenario where data is analyzed, and involve the term \"understanding\" (which was also chosen incorrectly in the previous question).\n\nAgain, the first and foremost task is to understand the situation. In this case, the analyst is reading printed data carefully. It is therefore reasonable to assume that he's using optical methods - such as a magnifying glass or a high-powered lens - to look more closely at the print.\nAs we know from the first question, the primary purpose of analyzing the data would be to gain a deeper understanding. To gain that understanding, a scientist needs a more precise understanding of the data. This eliminates options \"strain\" (A), \"happiness\" (B), and \"thought\" (C).\nThe remaining options deal with different forms and levels of understanding. But since the primary purpose is to gain insight, the best answer is the one involving the highest level of understanding - \"realization\" (D). \n\nThe question includes extraneous information - \"after letter after letter\" (the letters and not the whole document) - so the other options do not necessarily work. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \"realization\" (E)", "answer": "A: strain"}

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Google Maps and other highway and street GPS services have replaced what? Choices:  A: united states B: mexico C: countryside D: atlas E: oceans<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>You can tell this question from the word "highway" and "street". I am sure that everyone must have a GPS on their android phone, google map is one of the best GPS.<n><n>Google Maps and other highway GPS services are now replacing the role of traditional forms of navigation, such as printed roadmaps and atlases.<n><n>Hence the correct answer is D<n>### Instruction: Write a program to analyze the data.<n>Input:A 5 ×5= 25 numbers are in the matrix in the following program.<n><n>5 4 3 2 1 0<n><n>4 3 2<n><n>Input: Output: A single loop will do.<n><n>The answer is a list of integers ranging from 0 to 25 in inclusive. Because the loop will run from 4 to 5 times, it needs to start at 0 because there are 5 indices, and the fifth index doesn't equal 0 because there is only one item in that index.<n><n>### Instruction :Use the above code to write a program to read the matrix and find out what the largest total is.<n>Input: 30 22 23 33 34 35<n><n>Output: 115 (35 + 34 + 33 + 23 + 22 + 30)<n>

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The forgotten leftovers had gotten quite old, he found it covered in mold in the back of his what? Choices:  A: carpet B: refrigerator C: breadbox D: fridge E: coach<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer is C: breadbox.<n><n>We need to discard out-of-context answers because the leftovers are old, covered in mold in a breadbox.  The fridge (D) would never contain leftovers (although it can contain food) and the refrigerator (B) would not allow anything to age very long.<n>The coach would never hold old leftovers, and carpet doesn't really apply to the situation.<n><n>The most likely answer is C: bread box because (1) it is a place a person can hold bread, and (2) a leftover might be found there.<n><n>Input:The computer, was so slow that the web-developer asked what? Choices: A: the IT technician B: the programmer C: his neighbor D: for an upgrade E: a friend<n>Output:<n><n>Answer: "D" is the correct answer.  A slow computer is akin to someone having a cold: they both need antibiotics, for example.  There are numerous reasons that a computer could experience slowness -- from a simple virus to a major hardware failure. <n><n><n>In an IT company, a web developer would likely have direct access to an IT technician - much like a computer doctor will help your doctor diagnose and treat your medical problems.<n><n>Both the "programmer" and "neighbor" are misleading answers.  A programmer doesn't typically work for an IT company.  The neighbor is also unlikely since a slow computer would likely have a problem with their local area network anyway. <n><n>Upgrading a computer is a possibility, but this isn't necessarily a technical issue.  Most of the time, computers can be upgraded with better components, and this may make them faster. <n><n>Input:When will the next episode of <n>"Orange is the New Black" be available to watch on Netflix? Choices: A) Never, B) in 2 weeks, C) immediately, D) tomorrow, E) today, tomorrow<n>Output: <n><n>Correct answer is D).  Tomorrow.<n><n>Although this is a relatively straightforward question with some ambiguity, there are several ways that an inexperienced test-taker can end up providing a wrong answer.<n><n>The answer D) appears to

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Before getting a divorce, what did the wife feel who was doing all the work? Choices:  A: harder B: anguish C: bitterness D: tears E: sadness<n>Output:		Answers by the rule of elimination<n>A: Harder eliminated because it is not the correct form of this word.<n>B: Anguish will be the answer as it makes most sense from the context.<n>C: Bitterness can't be the correct answer because it is about feelings, not work.<n>D: Tears can be the answer as it expresses the wife doing all the work.<n>E: Sadness can be the answer because of similar wording.<n>Tears and sadness are also emotionally similar, so this option is out. <n><n>Finally, bitterness can be eliminated because it is a feeling, not work, which further reduces our list to (B) and (D). Choosing the answer with the least emotion gives us: "anguish".<n> <n>Input: She was mad. What was mad? Choices:   A: a friend's face B: her husband C: her husband's voice D: her life E: her husband's face<n>Output: reasoning:<n><n>The first question asks if we can determine what was mad.  Since no one else in the scenario is angry, and a friend or life aren't even named in the question, we eliminate the possibilities of "a friend's face" (A) and "her life" (E).<n><n>When determining the meaning of "mad, it will most likely be a noun:<n><n>The "her" before "husband's face" (D) tells us that this is a sentence about a woman and her relationship to the person. It is likely that "she was mad" (B) refers to her state of mind, while "her husband's voice" (C) refers to something she's hearing. <n><n>"Her life" (E) refers to her whole life. Thus, "her husband's face" (C) makes the most grammatical sense as a phrase here.<n><n>Input: What is the first rule of flying? Choices:  <n>A: Throw out your window. B: Don't look out your window. C: Hold onto the wings D: Don't open the window.<n>Output: A rule is a command, like saying "don't do that" or, in this case, "don't look out your airplane window."<n>Thus, the correct answer is (B

Choices:  A: low lands B: new york C: forest D: louisiana E: everglades<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Once again, the context for this question is established in the very first line, "Bill is stuck in the marsh".<n><n>The next thing to consider is the options.<n>Option A, "the low lands", is wrong because "the low lands" doesn't actually exist. It's unlikely to refer to the Everglades - the only other place in the choices - since geographically it doesn't fit the context of the story. It's difficult to imagine "the low lands" as a place name.<n><n>Option B, "New York", is eliminated as unlikely because it's not a natural geographical place name that one would use to locate an inhabitant.<n><n>Option C, "forest", doesn't fit the geography of the story either. It's unlikely that they refer to the Everglides as "forest" because "forest" generally refers to land full of trees and "forest" is not present in the story.<n><n>"Louisiana" (E) fits the geography of the context. It's the closest plausibly located location to Bill, who is in a marsh - the definition of a marsh being "a wetland covered by shallow water", and Louisiana being "coastal, low-lying areas" from the Collins dictionary, and therefore a plausible location for such phenomena to occur.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: Louisiana.<n><n>Input:What is 226 * 423? Choices:  B: 1,006 A: 2,877 C: 10,172 D: 2,991 E: 10,078<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Step 1 is to determine what the question wants you to find out. The question asks how to multiply 226 and 423.<n><n>Step 2 is to examine the choices given to come to the most likely answer.<n><n>Option A) 2,876: To figure out whether this answer is possible, we need to check whether 226 or 423 can be written as a multiple of a multiple of 2876. The answer is no. 226 can not be written as a multiple or product of 287, since for

Choices:  A: car B: fuel system C: accelerate D: boat E: airplane<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>By reading the question, the intended meaning of the terms "accelerator" and "pedals" was clear. It was only after reading the explanation that the "car" option was excluded, as the steering does not take place in a car.<n>The terms "accelerate" and "pedals," on the other hand, suggest a means to control acceleration, i.e. the foot pedals. <n>Therefore, the correct answer is option E: the airplane. <n><n>Input:What happens if someone tries to enter the mall which doesn't have the card, which they had borrowed from their mother? Choices: <n><n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The question is posed as a hypothetical scenario where a person attempts to enter the mall using a card they hadn't borrowed from their mother.<n><n>The question's emphasis on "they," "had," and "had borrowed" is critical in determining the correct response. The first-person pronoun "they" refers to a specific person, indicating that the question is about that person, rather than a generic individual. The fact that the person "had borrowed" the card suggests that they intended to return it to its original owner.<n><n>The following is another statement:<n><n>If a person in question did not have the card, the response would be an empty or "false" answer. However, the question has a clear sense of identity and emphasises borrowing and return to the mother.<n>A person who returns the card after borrowing it from their mother is not at all an empty or false answer.<n><n>So the final answer the person in question is not empty or false, which is the answer B.<n><n>Input:The problem of "Who ate all the cake?" was what problem it was a problem with Choices: A: A person  B: Finding and stopping Boss <n>C: No one D: Cake <n>Output: Reason<n><n>Reading the prompt closely reveals that it presents a series of scenarios that would be considered problems, but that are not actually problems per se.<n><n>In essence, the problem is "Who had all the cake?"

"Shop" (B) doesn't match. "Snakes are carried in North America" (D) is too long, making it obvious that the speaker's demand couldn't possibly be met. "Snakes aren't carried outdoors, they are kept in cages" (R) is equally absurd.<n>The only option that fits the given context is "to carry them, exotic snakes have to be transported under a warm bed."<n><n>Input: She did well and didn't give up after taking the exam.

The best answer is E: nope.<n><n>The question states that "she did well", not that she passed. This makes it unlikely she passed.<n><n>The last scenario states "she will be getting the scholarhship". She has to pass in order to get the scholarship, and the situation doesn't provide us with evidence that she passed. Therefore, the most accurate answer is E: no.<n><n>The option "absolutely" (B) is incorrect because it uses the word "absolutely", indicating 100% certainty, which is not present in the given question.<n>The option "not necessarily" (A) is incorrect for the same reason - it's not the case that she will definitely pass.<n><n>The option 'I don't know'  (C) is incorrect because the option doesn't indicate any particular certainty of outcome.<n>The option "may be" (D) is incorrect because the question isn't asking for the most likely scenario.<n><n>Input: Everyone is so happy tonight he even won an award for how  good he is doing.

Choices:  A: neighborhood B: subdivision C: city D: suburbs E: street<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To answer the first part of the question, the analyst should look at the phrasing of the statement: "where should he start looking." "He wanted" means that all options "should." This makes the second part of the question more relevant for answering the question: "where should he look."<n><n>The "should" part indicates that you're looking for where to "start looking" for a specific "something," but you don't know what "something" you should be looking for.<n>"Neighborhood" (A) would fit, given a possible context that the analyst wants to move out of an apartment into a larger home. However, it doesn't fit because neighborhoods normally don't have gates on them. "Subdivision" fits the context of the question, but it is vague on exactly which type of "subdivision" he should start looking for. "City" is more specific, implying that he is trying to buy a home inside the city limits of a large urban area, and is not trying to live on a mountain or rural part of the countryside. However, "city" also doesn't fit, because most cities don't have a wall or a gate around them. "Suburb" (D), like "city," is defined as part of a larger metropolis, though not necessarily a rural place. It fits in the context of the question better and is a more common word to use in context.<n><n>That leaves the choice between "suburbs" (D) and "subdivisions" (C), and a close reading of the context indicates that "subdivisions" is the correct answer. <n><n>#Author of the answer(s):<n>Vitaliy K<n>Link to original thread <n><n>### IQTestBot<n><n>### GithubProfile<n><n>#### GITHUB<n><n>https://vitaliyvk.github.io/vitaliyvk-github-demo/<n>

In fact, the term “obesity” is actually more applicable to “get fat”. <n><n>We can dismiss these two options.<n><n>“lazy” (B)is not scientific or medical.<n><n>Next, we discard “headache” (D), because it’s scientifically inaccurate; being in close proximity with TV doesn’t necessarily cause headaches.<n><n>The only choice left to pick out of this batch of answers is “laughter” (E). Laughter has been shown to trigger muscle contractions that lead to back pain. <n><n>So the final answer for this question is E: laughter<n><n>Input:What do most scientists believe will happen if a baby is raised in a city and not in nature? Choices: 1: A: They will die 2: B: They will get a headache 3: C: They will have a stroke 4: D: They will be unhealthy 5: E: They will get fat 6: F: They will move to the countryside<n>Output:Reason:<n>The third question is asking us to deduce an outcome given information about a certain baby.<n><n>The first logical option is that the baby will die (A). However, that's unlikely considering the scenario. Most babies live throughout their infancy, so it would be unrealistic for a baby to experience such a fate while it's living in a city.<n><n>Next, the option “headache” (B) makes sense because a baby not being able to breathe sufficient amounts of fresh air could contribute to headaches.<n><n>We can't dismiss the possibility of “stroke” (C) happening. Studies have revealed evidence that people who live in cities are more likely to experience stroke compared to people who live in rural areas.<n><n>“unhealthy” (D) is too vague a choice for such a scenario, while “

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is eating too much dinner likely to result in? Choices:  A: tiredness B: living longer C: stomach ache D: illness E: acid reflux<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to notice is that option B ("living longer") is an unrealistic outcome of eating dinner too much. So that can be crossed off from the beginning.<n><n>The same is true with other choices, such as C ("stomachache") and D ("illness"). Since the body was mentioned in the question, and there are many forms of illness, an all-encompassing option is not appropriate. Eating too much dinner may also cause acid reflux, but, as mentioned before, acid reflux should not be considered a "form" of illness. In addition, the options are very general and they would fail to address specific details of eating too much dinner. Therefore, there wouldn't be any real "proof" in such choices.<n><n>The remaining options A, C, D, and E are all inappropriate, too. It's unlikely that eating dinner too much would lead to tiredness, since tiredness may result from many other factors, including lack of exercise or insufficient sleep.<n><n>It's also inappropriate to apply "tired" to eating too much dinner, because it's just one of many consequences that could occur. In addition, the question doesn't explicitly list all of the consequences.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is C: living longer.<n><n>Input: How would you define "conservation"? Choices:  A:"preservation" B:"economy" C:"waste material" D:"resource" E:"prolongation"<n><n>Output: Choice: A -- Preservation<n>Reason: <n><n>The first thing we can identify is that option D is probably the word the question is looking for.<n><n>However, D (resource) is not the answer, because "resource" suggests a person, not a behavior or a concept.<n>"conservation" is a different concept altogether.<n><n>We can eliminate option A as well, because "preservation" has a similar meaning that "conservation".<n><n>Option B fits best: it suggests a behavior of "economy"; a choice that allows us to sustain the resources and avoid unnecessary waste. It is also the only reasonable choice. Since the context of the question contains the word "conservation" in the question, the word "economy" most likely means to "e

Choices:  A: finish line B: broken bones C: broken legs D: chapped lips E: healthy body<n>Output:		<n> <n>The most logical answer to this question is "E" because the end of the skiing season would be a health season. <n><n>For example, there is a good chance that if you were to ski enough times, you would develop all types of muscle pains and muscle tear. But the most common form of injury is often broken bones in the legs, which is usually the most common injury in those who are not equipped to deal with the rigors of winter sports. <n><n>So B, broken bones isn't an accurate answer. It doesn't make any sense in the context of seasonal skiing because it's a winter sport.<n><n>If "C" would be an inaccurate answer. It doesn' t make any sense when thinking about season skiing. Because broken muscles can occur in summer sports as well.<n><n>So, E is the correct answer here. <n><n>Input: What might be the outcome for "he who laughs last"? Choices:  A. He who smiles loudest B. She who sings softer C. The first one to give in D. The most optimistic E. The winner<n>Output:<n><n>You can't tell from the choices, but this question is a play on the phrase,"he who laughs last, laughs best." The outcome is more about laughter than winning.

Choices:  A: under rocks B: manhattan C: toenails D: grocery store E: fallen tree<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question is testing your ability to think critically. The answer is "fallen tree" (E), which highlights the importance of understanding the context of the question and the limitations of an object to determine its most appropriate location.<n><n>When considering the context, it becomes clear that the question is referring to a fungus, which is commonly found in fallen trees and other decaying organic matter. In fact, many plant species are specifically adapted to grow in the absence of sunlight, as it allows them to thrive in their natural environment without competing with other plants for sunlight. So, while it may be possible for a fungus to grow in other places, such as manhattan (B), it is unlikely to occur, as the circumstances of the environment would not be conducive to its growth.<n><n>However, as the circumstances become more complex, such as considering other environmental factors like temperature or availability of water, the answer may become more nuanced.<n><n>In conclusion, while it is possible for a fungus grow in manhattan (B) and other places, it is more likely to occur in a fallen tree (E) due to the lack of sunlight and competition from other plant species.

Then, the task is to analyze each option to determine which one is most applicable to that context.<n><n>Options "hang up" (A) and "contact" (C) do not make any sense in this context. The phrase "all day" suggests that the person is repeatedly calling, whereas hanging up implies that they're terminating the call. <n><n>Option "attracting ducks" (E), however, is ambiguous because it could have multiple interpretations. It could mean that the caller is trying to attract ducks, or it could refer to attracting other people. But since that's not the intended outcome, option E cannot be the answer.<n><n>Meanwhile, "respond" (B) and answer (D), both seem plausible.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The fat man refused to accept what was possible, he complained that he what the simplest activities? Choices:  A: no go B: unlikely C: unable D: cant do E: impossibility<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First we have to make use of clues such as grammar choice and context to infer what kind of "what" we are looking for. For example, if the question said "Which type of what" instead of "What was possible..." then we could easily answer "apple", because we know "apple" is a type of "what". If we do not see a clear choice of words in such a situation, then the answer must be one of the remaining possibilities.<n><n>Next, we need to make a strong guess at what is the context of the sentence, and see if it matches up with any of the remaining answers. In this sentence, the context seems to be a situation in which something happened, and we are trying to figure it out. The situation may be in the past, for example "I did not know what was happening yesterday". This indicates that the context could potentially be a story, or a sequence of actions which occurred.<n><n>The rest of the sentence is fairly consistent with the idea of "which is possible", and so "impossibility", or "cant do" is the best answer in this case.<n><n>Input:There exist an enormous number of elements that the human body depends on for survival. One example is the carbon which what? Choices: A: absorbed B: used C: taken D: eaten E: needed<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The key to the question lies in the clue to which phrase to use. The answer should be either "Which one...", "what", or "what...". Thus it makes sense to answer with D "What...". <n><n>Input: There exist an enormous number. Of what? Choices:A:elements B:element C:the element D:elements E:number<n>Output:Reason<n><n>We can get all the relevant information from this question. We know the question is about elements (or a number), and they are enormous in quantity. This makes us think that they would be "elements", or "a number". Thus we can answer "elements". <n><n>Input:-3 3-1 Choices:1)10 2) -13 3) -3 4) -17 5) 0 6) 1<n>Output:Ans:4 (0)Reason"<n><n>We can get a rough understanding of the question from the clue "What would

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is someone who gets angry after getting drunk likely to participate in? Choices:  A: violence B: falling down C: vomiting D: vomiting E: lower standards<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The scenario provides the choice of participation in violence but this is not a typical outcome after someone who gets angry after having one or two drinks. The person is likely to get violent after an intemperate amount of drinks and after the consumption of alcohol becomes excessive or after one starts being involved in alcoholism the person would definitely lower standards by indulging into sex or violence for the sake of alcohol.<n><n>In the context of the choices given, the most likely outcome is that the person may lower standards if they participate in violence. This would be because, after excessive consumption of alcohol the person would engage in the act of violence. So the correct answer is B.<n><n>Input: If it rains cats and dogs, what is it more likely to rain on Christmas Day than on any other day? Choices:  B: cats  C: dogs  D: fish  E: birds<n>Output: Reason (answer) :<n><n>There is a popular adage which says "when it rains cats & dogs" it rains excessively and that is probably the reason for the occurrence of floods or thunders<n><n>There is also another similar adage that is "It's raining cats and dogs" which means that the rain is heavy and also the weather is rough<n><n>The probability of such heavy rain would be unlikely because in such a case people would not celebrate Christmas in outdoors and would have Christmas celebrations in their homes, so that is the reason for selecting the option "inside" (B)<n><n>So the correct answer is B: inside<n><n>Input: The question at hand is, what happens when you mix chocolate milk and strawberry milk together? Choices:  No change 1: Chocolate strawberry milk 2: Chocolate water 3: Strawberry water 4: Orange water 5: Pink water<n>Output: Reason<n><n>When we add strawberry flavoured milk and chocolate flavoured milk the end result is Chocolate strawbery milk. The other answer options are wrong: you don't get chocolate water (2), strawberry water (3), orange water (4), or pink water (5). That is clear from the answers options themselves.<n><n>The only viable options for this problem include:<n>"no change" (none

Choices:  A: dog's mouth B: floor C: garage D: trouble E: nature<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>I understand dog's mouth is an option that might be easily thrown at you if you were stumped, but I want to share how I solved it. Here's a diagram that might help you to understand my thought process better:<n><n>This is why:<n><n>Because I don't want floors of houses to be made of wood anymore, I don't want cats to chew the floor.<n><n>Since cats can't chew up the floor, they'll chew something else such as a dog's mouth but to complete the diagram, we need a third thing that cats get into when ripping things apart.<n><n>You might think it would be trouble, and to an extent, you're correct!<n>But cats can be pretty messy while they are chewing up things, especially toys, so trouble seems to be something they might get, if they're ripping something apart.<n><n>The thing that cats get in trouble for could be anything, but it would most likely be related to chewing something up.<n><n>Now, think about what type of chewable things cats tend to have: toys, treats, etc.<n><n>To complete the diagram, it could only be a dog's mouth, chewed up by a cat.<n><n>So, cats rip apart dog's mouth!<n><n>In my opinion, this is one of my favourite ways to tackle this question. If someone would give this one to me, I'd be stumped. (Well, mostly because I don't want to be in the company with cats that often, so I'm not really sure what they like to chew up on). But here's how I approached it:<n><n>Let's reiterate what the question states: What do cats get into?<n>I understand the words can mean everything to everyone. You can interpret it in various ways. You might even say it would be their house, or trouble. For me, it just didn't sound right. Let's just say you interpret it in a way that makes you think it could literally mean anything.<n><n>While chewing up a house wouldn't make much sense, it would make absolute sense to chew up a dog's mouth.<n><n>Since the question asks you to choose an answer, it's important to note

Choices:  A: go to church B: appear in court C: watch soap operas D: paying attention E: go into court<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question suggests that testimony about spirituality can be heard when people "do" something. While an individual might hear testimony about spirituality at church (B), it would be very unlikely for them to hear such testimony while they were watching a soap opera.<n><n>Similarly, one might "pay attention" to another person testifying about their spiritual journey (E), but it would be far less likely that such a person would "hear testimony about spirituality" because they were "appearing in court" (C).<n>The correct answer is B: appear in court<n><n>Input: The testimonials and sermons of churches are about what?

Choices:  A: roof B: school C: beach D: closet E: garage<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question asks, where would you put a foldable chair if you do not want to use it and do not have large doors in your house.<n><n>Option 'A' is correct because if you do not plan on using it and there are no large doors in your house, you could put the chair on the roof of your house. There would be no practical use for the chair but it would be a place to temporarily store the chair.<n><n>Option 'B' is incorrect because if you did not plan on using it, there would really be no need to put the chair in a school. You could probably put the chair in the closet at your home.<n><n>Option 'C' is incorrect because although a beach could be considered a location, the question specifies that you would need large doors to move the entire chair there.<n><n>Option 'D' is incorrect because there is no need to put the foldable chair in a garage if there are no large doors needed to get it there. You could just put it in any other room in your house.<n>Option 'E' is incorrect because the question specifies that there are no large doors to put the chair in.

This eliminates "living room" and "big house," as they clearly would not be referring to spaces indoors. In any case, "small apartment" is the only logical choice.<n><n>Input:The two doctors debated whether the patient was experiencing what?

Choices:  A: picnic B: friend's house C: table D: space shuttle E: fairgrounds<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Context matters when picking out correct options for logical reasoning questions. In this case, the game refers to a soccer match, and the relevant context here is food-related. "Picnic" (A) and "friend's house" (B) are incorrect because the first relates to a meal outside the home, and the latter is an improbable location for eating.<n><n>The remaining options are based on food-related context. "Table" (C) and "fairgrounds" (E) are logical options because both are places to eat. However, "table" (C) refers to eating indoors, whereas "fairgrounds," as one might guess, is outdoors. It is therefore the more relevant option. The answer, then, is "fair grounds," option C)<n><n>Input:While reading about the life, the writer thought of another interesting detail about the man, and in doing so, made a connection with? Choices:  The story line.   A: the plot B: another character C: the author D: a sub plot<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>First, identify the specific type of information. "The writer" is the context, "life" is the specific subject of interest, and "thought" is the action that leads to the discovery. <n><n>Then, decide whether it's in reference to "the man" or "the writer." Option A) ("the man") and option B) ("another interesting detail") may seem like they pertain to the man, but in fact they're referring to additional information about the writer.<n><n>Option D) ("a sub plot") is the only option that refers to "the man." Therefore, it's the correct answer.<n><n>Input:The person was about to do something, but first they felt a sense of dread so they decided not to and? Choices:  B: Going for it C: Putting it off D: Do a reality check E: Going on to do something else<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Context is king when answering logical reasoning questions. "Do something" in this case is most likely a reference to some sort of task or action instead of a behavior.<n><n>Therefore, the other options all have to be about decisions regarding future events, such as a "reality check," "putting it off

The answers A, B, and E are all wrong, for example. Option B clearly states that Sam was in France when he ordered the blowfish, however, there is no information that indicates that Sam was in any specific country. It is also unlikely that a sushi restaurant would be located in the ocean.<n><n>The answer choices then must be narrowed down further by evaluating the context of the question and the plausibility of the answers in different scenarios. Option D sounds like it could be the best answer, as it does not include any spelling errors and gives an accurate description of where a sushi restaurant could be found.<n><n>However, option E describes the location as being "in the Atlantic Ocean", which is incorrect as it is unlikely that sushi is served raw in the ocean. <n><n>Therefore the most fitting answer is option D, in the fish market<n><n>So the answer is: answer (bill). The answer is D: in the fish market<n>

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would there be many people sitting in chair and listening to religious speech? Choices:  A: auditorium B: office C: synagogue D: confession E: church<n>Output:		Reason:It is a very famous question which is asked to many students. They will have to go for religious places with many people to answer this question. It is logical for students to think on these lines only.<n><n>Input:What were you doing when you suddenly met a large bear? Choices:  C: walking D: drinking E: sleeping  F: reading G: shaving <n>Output: Reason :The questions will generally ask about the current activities that the person is doing. Then he should answer the question related to this activity<n><n>Input: You have the 2/3 of the test scores in one hand, what do you have in your other hand? Choices: A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: 4 E: None<n>Output: Reason:- It is the general question for the kids or students. The question is to identify whether it's an Odd integer or even. In my assumption, most of the students will select the answer "None"<n><n>Input:A plane is flying at 900m per minute. It’s altitude is 200 metres above the ground. If the ground is increasing at about 120 meters per minute, how many kilometers from the take-off airport did it reach in 10 minutes? Choices:A: 3km B: 5km C: 4km D: 2km<n>Output: Reason :- The Question is to convert that 900 meters per minute and 200 meters above the ground to kilometers, in our assumption it will be just like (900x60)=5400 meters per minute. (120x60)=7200 m/min.<n><n>Thus in 10 mins, we will get total=5400*10+7200=96000. To answer correctly, We should just add 2(for extra speed) and so we will get 96200=9+62 (We can even add and subtract to make the answer more difficult to solve)<n><n><n><n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a mobile launching platform found in the ocean? Choices:  A: launch pad B: circus C: aircraft carrier D: large open area E: space station<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first option, "launch pad" (A), is eliminated as it is an inaccurate description of a launching platform. The next option, "circus" (C), is also eliminated because it doesn't make sense in the context of a launching platform found in ocean.<n><n>The options "aircraft carrier" (B) and  "large open area" (D) are too broad and general to be accurate in this context.<n><n>The final option is "space station" (E), which is an accurate description of a platform used for launching vehicles (satellites, rockets, etc.) into space.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer would be option (E), with the final word "space".<n><n>So the final answer would be E: space station<n>

Choices:  A: shame B: arrest C: embarrassment D: go to jail E: tension<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first and last choices are redundant because they're too broad. Therefore, the range of reasonable responses to committing perjury should narrow down to choices "D: go to jail" (D) and "C: embarrassment" (C).<n>But "D: go to ja...il" (D) would suffice as the sole response, as the other choices "C: embarrass...ment" (C) are already included.<n>Therefore, the final answer is D: Go to jail<n>

Choices:  A: laugh B: sit C: being entertained D: math E: meet<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first set of choices is fairly obvious, and includes options that are unlikely to be the activity a kid will do before going to play. This includes "being entertained" (C) and "math" (D), which seem to be odd things for a kid to spend his time doing before playing. They are not unheard of for a kid to spend time on, but for this context, they wouldn't be likely. <n><n>Options "sit" (B), "laugh" (A), and "watching tv" (E) may make sense, but for that context, what a kid wants to do before playing would not be to sit in the same room. Rather, this question is invoking how might a kid spend time before going to play with friends.<n><n>Therefore, the best answer is Option A<n><n>Input:The boss called the interns, so as to... Choices:  A, B: share a new project C, D: give an offer of a new contract E, F: check on new ideas<n>Output: Reason<n>The task is to infer what the boss was doing in inviting the interns.<n>Option "share a new project" (B) is tempting in that it shares information, but isn't specific. It could be sharing the vision of what the team is working on, or maybe a new plan for the project. However, it's not very likely information would be shared as generalized as "a new project", unless the project was already underway. <n><n>Option "check on new ideas" (E) sounds like a great option too, but again, is not specific with what exactly the boss wanted to check on regarding that. It's unclear if the boss wanted to verify an idea itself or the idea's progress.<n><n>Lastly, the most sensible option is "giving an offer of a new project" (D). It could very well have been the case that the boss gave an offer of a project to the interns, as a means of making sure the interns are productive and engaged in work that will boost the company. This way, there's a sense of accomplishment for both the boss and the interns once the project is completed.<n><n>Consequently, an answer of D is the best option<n><n>Input: The intern in computer science school are currently on a project

Choices:  A: playground B: mexico C: town D: outside E: world cup<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Context: A soccer field is being played in.<n><n>Option "A: Playground" (A) doesn't really indicate where the soccer field is located in relation to a building. It would make sense for a soccer field to be located in, or near, a building, but the question is clearing asking for the location outside of it.<n><n>Option "B: Mexico" (B) is a completely different country altogether. The context doesn't specify where it is being played in but the world cup is being played in Russia, so option "outside" (E) should be the next choice to eliminate.<n><n>Next is "D: Outside". Even though this seems more intuitive than "E: World Cup", this term doesn't specify where the soccer field would be located if not contained in a building. Because of this, it is easier to eliminate.<n><n>This leaves the other 3 choices: A, B, and D.<n><n>If the context of the question was the location of the soccer field was Russia, then it would only need to be identified on a map as "outside". No other further information needed.<n><n>Context: "Outside"?<n><n>Now, let's examine options "A" and "B". The question doesn't specify the location to be outside the building, it only says nothing is contained inside the building. This means "outside" is a logical interpretation.<n><n>So by eliminating options "C" and "D" we find ourselves with 2 choices:<n><n>A: Outside<n>B: Outside<n><n>They are each equally plausible.<n><n>But the answer given is "Playground" (A)<n>This is problematic. Option "A: Playground (A) is a completely different, although logical, possible choice.

Choices:  A: injury B: death C: playing uno D: coma E: falling down<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to consider is the scenario invokes extreme fear.  So we eliminate "to learn more about" (A), "Death" (B) and any choices that imply a learning outcome.<n><n>The other option "injury" (C) is possible, but if he loses consciousness he wouldn't be able to identify if he is actually injured.  And "coma" (D) isn't feasible since coma happens after the loss of consciousness already and implies no fear.<n><n>Finally there is "Falling down" (E). If he lost consciousness he wouldn' believe he's falling so this would be the correct answer.

Choices:A: the atmB:the bank teller C: a penny D: a dollar billE: anywhere else<n>Output: Reasonable answer:<n>Answers A and B are wrong, since the 100$ Bill can only be exchanged at the banks. Answer C is wrong, because it describes only an individual coin (the penny) that can be obtained from the 100$-bill. Answer D is wrong, if the cashier gives the 100 dollar bill. Answer E is the only one which is describing the actual procedure of what has to be done.<n><n>Input: If 12 ounces is equal to 547 cubes, then what are 438 ounces and 257 ounces equal to? Choices:A: 548 cubes B: 74 cubes C: 635 cubes D: 223 cubes E: 287 cubes<n>Output: Reason:<n>This question is asking us to figure out how many cubes there are in one ounce of cube. We can solve this without doing any multiplication. If we start from the right-hand side, we can see that 548 and 287 cubed give 27.14 and 18.37 cubes respectively. We start by subtracting 27.1 cubes from 18.3 cubes and end up with 3.4 cubes.<n><n>A more straightforward way to get that result is just subtracting 3.4 from 287 and then rounding to three digits.<n><n>Input:If the train was on the move, does 8400 meters have 9600 or 18400 meters in front of it?

Choices:  A: sorrow B: paying bills C: happiness D: frustration E: spending money<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here, the scenario is similar to that of the previous problem. The question asks about an emotion related to "getting paid." Once again, this suggests that the context is related to finances or economic factors.<n><n>The answer options are as follows:<n><n>Option "paying bills" (A) is implausible, as the act of paying bills is a necessary task that people engage in, but would not cause an emotional reaction like "sorrow."<n><n>Option "happiness" (B) is also implausible, because while financial gain can undoubtedly bring happiness, the act of getting paid itself wouldn't necessarily provoke a joyous emotional response. Additionally, happiness would not be the primary focus of the scenario, which suggests that other emotions would be more likely to arise.<n><n>Option "spending money" (E) is a strange choice as people buy things that satisfy their emotional feelings. <n><n>Option D "frustration" (D) could possibly be an option.  Money has been tied with emotions of joy, sadness, excitement, happiness, and satisfaction, but the question asks specifically about "getting paid".  An emotional reaction may come through the action of getting paid.

I lost his shoes, didn't know where they landed, and had to run from the corner store to his home.  About where did he run? Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>The given context describes how Bob's foot hurt from running barefoot from the hot pavement and how he tried to run barefoot even though he lost his shoes. If that is true, we know that at least one part of the pavement was hot underfoot. If his feet hurt, it is also safe to assume Bob's shoes were hot. Therefore, the hot pavement would be one of the two locations he ran to.<n><n>The first three options (A, B and C) are clearly inaccurate. Bob didn't run barefoot to a bed of nails. He didn't run to a town. And he didn't run to an attractive woman. All of these options would require walking, not running, and thus do not fit the description of a place where his feet hurt.<n><n>Finally option D is correct. Based on the context, we know Bob had to travel to run from the corner to his home. We also know he lost his shoes on the hot pavement, so it would follow that whatever he ran to was located in a neighborhood or on a city block where he did not have shoes. And "attractive consistent look" (D) describes the layout of the city block pretty well.<n><n>So the final answer would be "city block" (D)<n><n>Input: What is the first number, and what is the last number, that satisfy the following conditions?

Choices:  A: insubstantial B: massless C: dwarf D: inconsequential E: good<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to ask yourself is whether the options A-E describe the same object, or are describing different objects altogether. Since an option like "massless" would obviously describe something very different from, say, "massive", we can rule out the option A. <n><n>We can also rule out the options B and D, which do not make sense for the same reason: they both describe the object as being very small, where an object like a building would generally be big. <n><n>This leaves us with options C, E and F. The option C describes the building as "dwarf", and while this would fit the description of a building not well constructed, a question like this one wouldn't make sense in a science-related context.<n><n>That leaves the options E and F. Option E describes the building as "good", which is a correct word but would not make sense to call a massive building which hasn't been properly built<n><n>The answer is F: good<n><n>Input: What was the first name given to the first person in the world to reach the top of Mount Everest? Choices: 	A: Iva B: Gwen C: Margaret D: Ruth E: Diana<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The options A, B, and D do not make sense because they all describe women whose names are not the correct answers C and E.<n><n>The options C and E, however, are plausible. C could describe Margaret or Ruth. However, there is no mention of Margaret or Ruth in the scenario, so the information available is either insufficient to eliminate any of these options or insufficient to choose an answer from the remaining options. As a result, it does not follow that C or E must be the answer to the question. <n><n>Similarly, E may seem to describe a woman, but we do not know what the first name would be.<n><n>As a result, the answer to the question is F: Iva.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:They moved out of the city to have a master bedroom, what kind of home did they seek? Choices:  A: large house B: suburban home C: big house D: old house E: keeping personal objects<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To understand the context of the sentence, you should know that "keeps personal objects" has no relation with living space while "having a master bedroom" is related to space. So D is the best choice.<n><n>You can use the same approach even if the question is more complex, say<n><n>Input: The first person in the history who could be honored by his country, what was he? Choices:  B: inventor A: famous scientist C: king of England D: first president<n>Output: Reason<n><n>A is best if we think that king is the head of the country, and D is best that the first person who could be honored.<n>Input: The one who found America, who was the person? Choices:  D: Christopher Columbus B: John Smith A: Samuel Houston C: Robert E Lee E: James Cook<n>Output: Reason <n><n>As you can imagine, it is best to eliminate options that do not match the description while considering the remaining one. In this case, Columbus found America, thus D is the answer.<n>Input: What is so special about American presidents? Choices:  E: they live in Washington Dc A: they are elected by Americans B: they never served any foreign wars in US C: they are considered to be a symbol of the US<n>Output: Reason

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When people discover something new while chatting with friends, why are they likely to continue talking? Choices:  A: agreement B: to fill their time C: discomfort D: misunderstanding E: learning about<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The scenario suggests that people are likely to continue talking because they're learning new things. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that people continue talking because of "discomfort" (C), because no mention is made of such a reaction.<n><n>Option "agreement" (A) may seem intuitive at first glance, but it doesn't fully capture the scenario. Simply because there is an exchange of new information with friends does not mean that the discussion leads to "agreement." For example, if someone were to tell a friend about a new recipe, the discussion might not produce a consensus, but rather spark new questions and ideas. <n><n>Option "to fill their time" (B) is also unlikely. While people may talk simply to pass the time, it is not the main purpose of the conversation. People talk to socialize, not simply to fill an empty moment.<n><n>Therefore, the only remaining options are "learning about" (E) and "misunderstanding" (D). While "learning about" seems like the most likely answer, it is also the most specific one, while "misunderstanding" is more vague. Since it's not specified that the conversation is a misunderstanding, the correct answer is "learning about" (D).<n><n>Input: Suppose that I ask my boss for the reason why he is always out of office when I need to meet him. For what situation, then, would he most likely be out of office? Choices:  I: out of town II: working late III: on a business trip IV: in the restroom V: in the office<n>Output : Answer:<n><n>The question suggests I would likely ask my boss's whereabouts while he's away from the office, but option (II) is incorrect. Out-of-town, out-of-office, and out-of-office hours are all distinct concepts, and all of them describe the boss's time away from the office. While he is out of town, he would be away from the office and might be using an out-of-office response - thus, option (II) is not specific enough. <n><n>Option (III) is not likely because out-of-office does not refer to a business trip, and it does not refer to a meeting with me either. A business trip only refers to travel, so it cannot be the situation

Choices:  A: sleeping longer B: getting cold C: death and decay D: change of color E: stop breathing<n>Output:		<n><n>The given context implies a deadly scenario, so the first step is to eliminate the irrelevant options.<n><n>Option "death and decay" (D) is out, because it describes the aftermath of death. It doesn't describe the process of dying itself.<n><n>Similarly, option "stop breathing" (E) is out, since it doesn't take into account the fact that Janet could feel herself dying.<n><n>Option "change of color" (C) is out because it is not necessarily related to dying process of dying.<n><n>The final two options make sense in the context of dying, so "getting cold" (B) and <n>"sleeping longer" (A) are both reasonable choices.<n><n>However, option "sleeping longer" is more likely as it indicates a gradual process that is likely to end in death.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is B: getting cold.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions based on the given data.<n><n>Terry decided that since moving to a different city, he has begun to suffer from insomnia. He now sleeps for less than 6 hours every night, as opposed to the normal 9. While living in LA, he noticed a pattern. During the summer, he typically got about 6-7 hours of rest, and during the winter, he typically slept 9-10 hours. This was not due to a change in the temperature, since he sleeps best when it’s cold. This is true even when the temperature changes by many degrees during the year. <n><n><n><n>You must find which of the following is true based on the given data?<n><n>A.

Where might she look for one? Choices:  A: house B: music shop C: studio D: storage E: closet<n>Output:		Reason: The options A, B, and D do not fit well with the given information. We are looking for something to block out the loudness of the guitar noise. Therefore, the options C and E fit the criteria. Option C is most preferable as the store has many acoustic guitars available to select from.<n><n><n><n>Input: After being laid off because of the covid 19, John was hoping to apply to his old job again, although he had not worked in this field for a long time: Choices: A: get rid of the negative thinking B: focus on what is important C: keep working on job-seeking D: get ready to start working again E: let bygones be bygones<n>Output: The option A seems like the right choice, as it emphasizes John's negative thinking, but that is not what he needs right now. Instead, he needs to think about what is important, such as getting his old job back. The options B and E are also good choices, but they are not as specific as B. Therefore, option C is the most correct answer for this scenario. <n><n>Input: Which one of the following statements indicates that there is something wrong with the sentence below? A: This one doesn't belong. B: I always put on my bra. C: I always sleep in my bra. D: I always sleep in bras. E: All girls do!   <n>Output: The "bra" in the sentence needs to be plural, which can show that there is a problem with the sentence. Thus, the correct statement is "All girls don't do!". <n><n><n>Input:  Which of the Following is not a cause of tension in a relationship?   Choices: A. One of the partners is always right. B. There is no compromise from either partner. C. Both partners feel that they are not appreciated. D. One of the partners does not take responsibility. E. Disagreements happen.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would happen to a person if his or her money is stolen? Choices:  A: complete sentence B: feel angry C: drink tea D: cross street E: park<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "completed sentence" (A) is not necessary. The choice would be the same if the person had his money stolen or his life savings were all transferred to his sibling's account, or just the $10 or $100 you thought you left in your wallet. That is, a completed sentence is only an example, and the outcome would remain the same.<n><n>Option "feel angry" (B) is plausible. But, again, anger isn't an outcome that is necessary to have "happened" to a person. If someone's car gets totaled in a crash, but he or she is in an overall happy and healthy state of being, anger isn't something we can guarantee he or she would feel.<n><n>Option "drink tea" (C) is too specific to consider. Drinking tea is a nonessential action a person might do if his or her money were stolen -- it's an action that might help the person cope with feelings of helplessness or anger. But, again, it's a nonessential action that isn't necessarily related to the outcome of money theft.<n><n>Option "cross the street" (D) is, of course, an action people take every day if someone or something crosses their path. It's a common occurrence, and crossing the street isn't an outcome of the theft.<n><n>Lastly, option "park" (E) is a verb that, similar to crossing the street, is an action that anyone might do if someone or something is in their way. But again, just like option "cross the street," no one can guarantee if they will park their car or not. It's an action that someone takes -- but the outcome is not parking one's car in general.<n><n>So the correct answer is E: Park<n><n>Input: The teacher asked her English class to write a paragraph about the history of their town. Which of the following people would have the least amount to write about? Choices: A: the librarian B: the mayor C: the police department D: the farmer E: the lawyer<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Option "the police department" (D) knows almost everything about their jurisdictional area, and the least amount they would have to write about in that paragraph is the past 150

Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option "regular" (E) is incorrect because it implies that extra-strong glass is, in fact, a regular kind of glass. The scenario describes fragile glass, which means it is not "regular" in any sense.<n><n>Option "forceless" (D) is also incorrect, because it refers to a lack of strength, which undermines the context in which the scenario sets it up. The word "forceless" seems to work well as a descriptor for ordinary glass, but it doesn't make sense to describe extra-strong glass that way.<n><n>Answer: Choices:  A : weak B : fragile C : forceless D : regular E : flimsy<n><n>Option D : regular E : fragile<n><n>

Choices:  A: cross street B: stand upright C: speak spanish D: speak chinese E: further education<n>Output:		Reason:The instruction here is asking you, if you were a person, what would you be capable of. Choices A and B only apply to the person, where cross the street and stand up are actions that would be possible for the person to do.<n><n>Choices C, D and E only apply to people, because each of the choices require further education to be able to do.<n><n>The first choice, crossing the street would be possible for the computer to do, however it is not an ability that is common in computers, where they can only take a few actions and cross the street is considered outside of their abilities.<n><n>The second answer of standing upright is also doable for the computer where if you were a person you would need to be able to do this action.<n><n>The last answer of furthering education is not something that computers do, as such it is outside the scope of the question.<n><n>So, the final answer is B: stand uprigh<n><n>Input: Which of the following is the most common outcome of a scientific experiment? Choices: 1: Success 2: Failure 3: Money 4: Discovery 5: Theft<n>Output: The question is asking about the success of an experiment, which usually indicates a satisfactory conclusion to the work.<n><n>The answer "theft" (5) would be considered a failure in conducting an experiment.<n><n>The answer of "discovery" (4) would be an accurate result if the experiment was successful. However, if the experiment was unsuccessful, the conclusion would be that the theory behind the experiment was not correct. <n><n>The answer of money would also be a success if the experiment was a success, as the results indicated a correct conclusion. Failing this experiment would result in negative profits. Even if the experiment was a failure, it would still have been a successful endeavor if there was money gained from the investment of the money that was put forth to conduct the experiment.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is 4: Discovery<n><n>

Similarly, not knowing where a hole is located would not make it an apt place to find a lemur.<n><n>The field represents a location where lemurs do exist, but the correct answer is E: In Heaven. This is because, while lemurs are a type of primate - one of the most basic animal groups out there - they are also found nowhere near the planet Uranus, which is the last answer option (D).<n><n>

Choices:  A: country club B: rich person's house C: pool D: park E: fitness center<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Similar to the previous question, the prompt immediately eliminates less relevant options (B) and (C). The wording of the question (i.e. "worried his friend thought he _meant..._" implies that the correct answer will be the opposite of the assumption the friend made.<n><n>From there, it's a matter of determining which of the remaining options is the opposite of a "pool". It's immediately easy to eliminate pool, which would be the opposite of the statement "I meant the pool". And we know the correct choice isn't country club (A), because being worried about being thought to be in a "rich person's house" and being worried of thinking someone will think you're "at the other end" of a country club are completely different.<n><n>Let's look at the remaining two choices:<n><n>Fitness center (E) is a common location for squash courts - a search for "pool vs. squash courts" would return results indicating that many public pools include squash courts as part of their facility. The phrase "at the other end of the park" might be used in reference to public parks which contain squash courts. <n><n>Since the friend isn't worried that his friend will think he went to his house but to a public park, Fitness center (E), would have to be the correct answer. <n><n>Input:I'm leaving early tomorrow, don't wake me up.What am I doing the early what?  Choices:  A. Mornings B. Morning C. Midday D. Afternoon E. Evenings<n>Output: Reasonninig:<n><n>Again, the first step is to eliminate the less relevant options. In this case, those are "don't wake me at dawn" (A) and "don't woke me at noon" (D).<n><n>Now, the important question is how early tomorrow will the person be leaving that he wants his friend not to wake him.<n>Clearly, he's leaving that early, so it can't be "afternoon" (D), so that leaves us with the first two choices: "mornings" (B) or "morning" (C). <n><n>Mornings (B) is an indistinct term and suggests

Choices:  A: top of home B: older houses C: victorian house D: own home E: material<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>First, consider what the question is actually asking. It's not trying to determine the type of home that most likely has an attic filled with items, but the type of item that would most likely come from such a place.  This is a classic logic question, in which the goal is to select the best possible answer based on the given choices.<n><n>The answer can only be something that would most likely be found in an attic - an older building with many nooks and crannies.<n><n>There's a good chance the homeowner's items will not be something that is found in many houses today - a "material" (E). An "own home" (D) would refer to the homeowner, not their attic. A "top of home" (B) is likely to contain valuable art, but nothing old. A "victorian home" (C) has an implied lack of history, since the term "victorian" suggests newer than the attic.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E - "material"<n>

Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n>Output:		<n><n>A) "Attached" (A) in a practical sense means "strongly affixed." In the given context, it's unlikely that someone would be "strongly affixed to a remote control" in the sense that they adhered onto it physically in any way, and thus this answer seems unlikely. <n><n>B) "Nostalgic" (B) may also carry the implication that a person would carry strong emotional attachment to the remote control, and they indeed seem fond of the object. However, it could just as easily mean that they have a fond nostalgic memory of using in the past, as opposed to a strong emotional affection for it presently. Hence, this word would have to be analyzed in the context of the previous word given to gauge the level of "attachment" it's describing. <n><n>C) "Companionable" (C) refers to a company or a familiarity that people share. It wouldn't be correct to apply this term to a piece of inanimate object. Hence this seems unlikely. <n>D) "Likely" (D) is a word that indicates possibility. When put together with "feel", it creates a vague emotional context that could describe a wide range of feelings between dislike and extreme fondness. Contrast this with "close", which is the last choice on the list. "Close" expresses a concrete, measurable amount of closeness. A close emotional bond doesn't sound as likely as a close physical proximity. Hence, it's the more logical choice here. <n><n>E) "Close" (E) in a practical sense defines physical proximity. It may be used in a figurative sense as well, but any figurative interpretation of "close" in this context would be less likely than a direct reference to the geographic proximity of the remote control. Therefore, it's the most accurate answer to this question.<n>So the answer is E: close<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The camper looked up at the vast night sky, it left him feeling mighty what? Choices:  A: unimportant B: insignificant C: stellar D: somewhat E: helpless<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first, and most important, thing to understand with the first sentence is to acknowledge and recognize the specific words that are being used and how they tie into the rest of the passage. <n><n>Specifically, the word "vast" is doing heavy and expressive work in the first sentence. We see that this word is used to describe what the camper sees, so we can logically infer that whatever the camper sees must be relatively large and expansive in nature.<n><n>To build on that thought, it would be helpful to consider the word "vast", in contrast to another word which is the antonym: small. When we have an understanding of what "vast" means, it automatically creates an understanding of what "small" means in relation. And because "vast" is so much larger in scale than "small", we can easily determine that anything that would be comparable or even remotely similar in size to vast is relatively large.<n><n>Therefore, from this understanding, it immediately makes sense to eliminate the option "insignificant" (B), because while it may be possible for something to be smaller than vast, the word "small" cannot be applied to vast. If it could, it would not be as big of a word to describe something as vast.<n><n>Similarly, we then eliminate the option "unimportant" (A), because of how the word "important" opposes the word "unimportant" in the dictionary. So if those two words are antonyms in dictionaries, there can't be something larger in scale that is smaller in significance. And if that is the case, there can be no options that contain "smaller" next to it.<n><n>Besides those terms of comparison, we can see that there must be something special about the camper's view. We don't get any sense that he was simply in amazement, because there is no expression that would imply the camper was that amazed by whatever he was looking at, nor is expressive enough. If you look at the sentence again, specifically the "feeling mighty" part, it is used sarcastically to make fun of someone. So, we can then infer that the camper must have felt rather powerful.<n><n>And we can come to this conclusion by looking at how the sentence is structured. We have "The camper looked up" first.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:To properly instruct children attending school you would need a great deal of what? Choices:  A: boredom B: patience C: time D: teachers E: inspiration<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in analyzing the question is to identify the task that the instructor is trying to perform. That task is to "properly instruct," or teach, the child students attending the school. <n><n>Hence, the options "boredom" (B), "patience" (C), and "teachers" (E) are all irrelevant to the task. None of them are actually required to teach students, and in fact, the former two would be things that the instructor would want to avoid during the teaching process.<n><n>Option "time" (D) is plausible but unclear in its context. While giving children time is a necessary part of teaching, it doesn't answer the question regarding what is needed for proper instruction. To properly teach a child, the instructor would need inspiration, not just time.<n><n>Finally the remaining option, "inspiration" (E), is relevant to the task and accurately describes what is needed in order to properly instruct the children. Therefore, this would make the most accurate answer.<n>So the final answered is E: inspiration<n><n>Input:What would you consider to be a sign that this test had been designed to catch as many mistakes as possible? Choices: 1) The tester must have a college degree 2) More than half of those taking the test failed 3) A multiple-choice format 4) All options are correct 5) A very time-consuming essay<n>Output: Reason.<n><n>As the question is posed, there are five possible options to choose from. To determine which option best describes the scenario, it is first important to identify the reason that the test was created, then determine what is required in order for it to qualify as a test catching "as many mistakes as possible."<n><n>The test was created to catch "as many mistakes as possibly" in order to ensure that no students fall through the cracks and fail the course despite having the capacity to be successful. In order to qualify as a catch-all test for "as many mistakes as many mistakes as possible," the test must be well-designed.<n><n>Option 5 ("a very time-consuming") sounds like a good choice, but it is too vague to qualify as a sign that the test was designed to catch as many as possible. <n><n>Option 1 ("the tester must have a

Choices:  A: fresh smell B: good credit C: smooth skin D: fresh produce E: headache<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Analogously to the data analysis question above, we want to eliminate obvious and nonsensical answers. Option "fresh smell," while intuitively appealing at first, is rendered unnecessary since it can't possibly make the user "smooth skin." The same idea applies to options B and C. <n><n>Fresh "produce" can indeed assist with smooth skin, but it needs an object rather than a nonspecific label to be accurate, since "fresh" could describe anything from tomatoes to eggs to peanut butter.<n><n>The only remaining options are "smooth skin" (D) and "fresh produce" (E). We can infer that the person applied lotion to their body, and we can also expect the resulting outcome to be a smooth application of the product. Therefore, the answer is D: smooth skin<n><n>Input:The man bought a pair of jeans. What did he want? Choices: A: new experience B: cheap pair C: good credit D: comfort E: fresh produce<n>Output:Reasonning:<n>We immediately eliminate option "cheap pair" (B) and option "good credit" (C) as being too specific for what they want. Both of those options imply an interest in how much the product costs or how easy it will be to afford.<n><n>Options "new experience" (A) and "fresh food" (E) don't seem as though they would cause a jean purchase. While jeans may be a novel item for some, it would seem as if their main purpose would be to protect vulnerable areas rather than enhance life.<n><n>That leaves only two choices: comfort (D) and "new experience" (E). If the man's main priority is comfort, we can assume that he wants this to be a new and improved experience. However, the man also bought jeans, which have become a common staple in society. Therefore, we can eliminate that answer, but still leave "new experience" (D).<n><n>Input:After eating dinner, what did the man feel? Choices: A) full B) headache C) thirst D) hungry E) peace<n>Output:Reasonnig:<n>We can immediately eliminate "feel headache" (C) because everyone who ate dinner probably didn't feel a headache afterward.<n>For the same

You need simply guess the answers, or select an incorrect answer as your guess.<n><n>The first sentence describes a tidy person who is putting a dictionary in place. By taking the words into consideration, we can see that this is probably a person who is at home, at their leisure, and possibly a person who has a job that might be related to reading or writing. But if this is the case, what kind of dictionary are we referring to?<n><n>In addition, the sentence mentions that the dictionary is loose. That would more likely happen during your study, a class where a student is taking notes from a dictionary, or an older student using a dictionary. So a dictionary in that context would belong on a desk. If it were on the shelf, we would think that the student was in a library or reading area.<n><n>Thus we choose "desk" as our answer, since we are dealing with a person who is at leisure, in a home environment, with an important note-taking tool (a dictionary).<n><n><n><n>Input: What type of plant is the one pictured? Choices:  Cactus B: Palm tree C: Orchid D: Dracaena E: Ficus<n>Output: Reason<n><n>You must be very familiar with cactus' flowers in order for the sentence, "Flowering cacti", to make sense.<n><n>However, we are probably talking about a plant in the United States or some other place where people take care of their gardens and plants. And therefore, the first option could well be true, since we are asking about a flower.<n><n>The next thought was, "what if it's a plant they have to take care of? We'd have to think of the possibility that it's an indoor plant."<n><n>Then we noticed that the letter "C" was used, which stood for "cactus", and the letter "D" was left out of the puzzle, which stood for "dracaena" (a plant found in Africa's tropical rainforests) and the letter "E" was next in line.<n><n>With these logical processes in mind, we can quickly figure out the solution by cross-checking with the options.<n><n>Input

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What common chemical reaction is often used as a heat source? Choices:  A: coal or wood B: fire C: lava D: house E: solar energy<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In this question, there are two sets of information involved: a list of heat sources and a set of chemical reactions.<n><n>First, the candidate should try to make a mental leap to determine which of the options listed could be heating sources. In this case, "fire" (B) and possibly "house" (E) could qualify.<n><n>Next, the candidate should focus on those heat sources that could also be chemical reactions. They're likely to find that "coal" (A) and "wood" (B) fit the description. Both contain chemical properties and are used for thermal energy.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is a combination of options A and B: "coal and wood."<n><n>#input: what is the ratio of the area of triangle ABC to the area of rectangle DEF if DE is an altitude and the lengths of AB and CD equal 5 inches, DB=3 inches, and DF=10 inches<n>output: reason:<n>A) the ratio is 10/15<n>B) the ratio is 25/45<n>C) the ratio is 5/12<n>D) triangles are always congruent<n>E) there are too many unknown ratios in this problem with no known ratios to figure it out<n>answer: B<n><n>[1]

When the fighting started, he only saw what sort of things? Choices:  A: fort B: orphans C: battlefield D: other countries E: war<n>Output:		A fort (B) is a stationary and man-made location, not what he sees in battle. Likewise, an orphan (C) is a passive human who needs John's help. <n><n>The options "battlefield" (D), "war" (E) and "other countries" (D), all describe a location that is "seen" as a noun, and none describe what John sees as an action (as in, what he witnesses).  <n><n>So the final answer to the question is Choice E: war.<n><n>Input:There are two ways to play a chess game.  There is also a way to play a card game.  There are two ways to play the card game.  There is a way to beat your opponent in the game.  A: to win a match B:  C: to lose in a hand D:  E: <n>Output: The word 'win', like many sport-related words in the English language, can act as both a noun and a verb (as in, the verb 'win' meaning to succeed in the game, such as checkmate).  However, it can also function purely as a noun:  'Who won?' or 'Is there anything we can do to win?'<n><n><n>We can use the 'who' to indicate that the sentence is asking about a person, rather than the act of winning.<n>We can make an educated guess at the correct answer choice using this method. <n>We can cross out the noun answers, and we know that 'win' and 'play' are both verbs, so we could put a question mark next to those answers too.<n><n>The left-hand column is the correct answers.<n>Here, 'win' acts as a verb, meaning 'to win,' so C is out: 'to lose in a hand.'  We know it's only a verb because 'to win' on its own indicates an action verb. <n>'To lose in a hand' implies that 'win' is a subject, rather than the verb of the sentence.  <n>Then, E might be a verb describing 'to beat your opponent' in the card game.<n>The final answer to the question then becomes C: to win a hand.<n><n>Input:Which of the following is not an example of a fruit?<n>Choices:  A:  B:

Choices:  A: liquidated B: own resources C: branch out D: commit crime E: game over<n>Output:		Reason: A game is on and you are ready for it.<n><n>There is nothing wrong with option "commit crime" except that the word "commit" is unnatural. It should have been replaced with an alternative word like "undertake" or "undertake".<n><n>Output: We know you want a new car, but what do you want to do to acquire that new car? Choices: 		A: put a deposit on it B: save up first C: hire a chauffeur D: trade in E: go out and get it<n>Output:Reasoning:<n>Output: A car requires a new car as well as the money to buy it. You also need some money to maintain the car. If your savings are not sufficient, you will have to take a loan. <n>You may also opt for a trade-in. The process involves an exchange transaction that allows you to exchange an old car for a new one. For example, if your existing car is too old or damaged to sell, you may exchange it for a new one to lower its value.<n>You may hire a chauffee to drive the car for you or go out and get the car yourself. The choice is yours.<n><n>Output: How do I make chicken stew? Choices:  Choices: (A) put chicken on a plate and sit on it (D) cook some chicken (E) eat the chicken and sit on it (F) stick chicken on a plate (B) put the chicken on the stove.<n>Output:Reason: The purpose of chicken stew is to cook the chicken and make sure the chicken is cooked properly, <n>and is ready for you to eat. So chicken stew is cooking the chicken.<n><n>In the situation of a chicken coming out of a hen house, you eat the chicken and then let the chicken sit on a plate. This way you can eat all of the chicken, and you know how the chicken tastes. <n>It is a win-win for you and the chicken.<n>

Choices:  A: pay debts B: make money C: having money D: making money E: keep house<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Analyzing the options yields insight into the question. For instance, "keeping house" (B) is not a logical option for the question's subject, considering the words "active and "make".  This indicates that the subject is actively making money.<n><n>Option "paying debts" (A) doesn't seem likely given the context, either. Unless he's trying to make money to pay off a debt, it's not a logical outcome of being active.<n><n>Another option eliminated is "having money" (C). This would describe a person who is passive rather than active.<n><n>The two remaining choices are:<n> - Making money (D)<n> - Making money(E)<n><n>By rule of elimination, it could only reasonably be<n> the "make money" (D). "Make money" is the option that describes the outcome of being active, and that is the only option left in the question. Choice (E) is a duplicate, and therefore disallowed. <n><n>The final verdict is option D: money.<n><n>Input:How could the world be saved if everyone were a what? Choices: A: millionaire B: genius C: billionaire D: philosopher E: artist<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>"If everyone were a millionaire", (A) is the most logical option. It is the only one that describes a positive outcome, as being a millionaire is generally a covetted and sought after occupation.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is choice A: Millionaire.<n><n>Input:There is the man who works at a what? Choices:: A: Bank B: Factory C: Bookstore D: Restaurant E: Laundromat<n>Output:Reason::<n><n>Noting the description of the person working alone, "the man who works at a restaurant" (D) could potentially work by himself at a restaurant. However, this is the only choice which doesn't immediately disqualify itself. This points our attention toward choosing the option which doesn't immediately rule itself out.<n><n>The remaining options are "The Bank" (A), "The Factory" (BC), "The Bookstore" (D), "The Restaurant" (E), and "The Laundromat" (F).<n><n>Each of these could be considered

Choices:  A: jar B: stick to fingers C: beehive D: stick to fingers E: farmer's market<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>We have the options A and B as farms. We need to find from the choices which of it has stick to fingers. We can remove choices C and D, as those both are describing how to eat honey like stick to finger and beehive. Choice A describes farms and choice B tells that we should stick to fingers.<n><n>Input: What is required to run the program? The program must have a memory of 32 bytes. How many bytes are required for the program? Choices:  B:45 D:36 A:29 E:25 C: 35<n>Output: Reasonnings:<n><n>Program must have 32 bytes. Program has total 29 bytes. The program can be stored in 1 bytes(1024). So program is having 9 bytes for extras which can be used for any function. Program requires for total 32 + 9 + 9 = 40 bytes as memory so finally ans is 9.<n><n>Input: You have 7 balls of different colors. The balls are in two different containers. You can only take one ball at a time out of each container. How many different ways are there to get 6 balls? Choices: E: 15 D: 24 B: 10 A:16 C: 10<n>Output: Reasonings:<n><n>If we take one at a time from each container  the second from the first is also from the first as it is filled only two colors. So we have 2 different colors.<n>Now third from first will have 3 different colors.<n>Fourth from first will have 4 different colors.<n>Fifth from first will have only 2 different colors. And this completes the six. It includes 2 from first and 1 from second.<n>Now, the second from second will have all the 6 different colors. This means its all same.<n>There are 7 * 7 = 49 ways to do it. However, one of these combinations i.e. second from first, second from second is same so we should avoid it in counting.<n><n>That means ways in which we can take 6 from 7 balls will be = 49 - 1 = 48.<n><n><n>

Where might he go? Choices:  A: neighbor's house B: bridge C: home D: homeless shelter E: prison<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "D" is correct -- the reason that Jim goes to the homeless shelter is that his wife is on probation for alcohol. The implication of this answer choice is that a married couple can't live together and both be sober, the way we would expect.<n><n>Option "B" is partially correct, in that a bridge (or overpass) allows people to get from one place to another without walking by foot. It is, however, incorrect because it is not likely to be a place frequented by alcoholics, and does not address the context of the question involving probation.<n><n>Options "A", "C", and "E" are incorrect because they do not explain why Jimmy goes to the homeless Shelter. Option "A" does not provide any reasoning behind Jimmy's action, while options "C" and "E" are inappropriate given the context that his wife is on alcohol probation.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is D: homeless<n><n><n>## How can a robot read these types of questions correctly?<n><n>A.

The concrete here, refers to the solid ground where one typically stands while playing.<n><n>The options provided thus far include the most common surfaces on which kids play games, e.g. streets and soccer fields. However, these can certainly be played on without standing on anything concrete.<n><n>The last option, E, is the only one that can be played on by standing on concrete. Hence "pool table" is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:A: A person from Texas is called TEXAN Choices:  A, b, c, d, e<n>Output: Reason :<n>In the instructions for the question, "A: A person from New Jersey is called NJSRNJ" is incorrect, yet this choice is also incorrect, due to context.<n><n>The question reads that a person from Texas is called a "Texan", as if one is called "Texan" simply because of the state they come from. In this instance, context is vital to deciphering the correct answer.<n>Because "Texan" means someone who is from, or resides in, the U.S. state Texas, the correct answer is D, as is only a person from Texas in this context, not anyone from there alone.<n><n>In some contexts, a person's home state can be referred to as their home country without causing confusion, but here, the fact that Texans call themselves "Texans" and New Jersey residents "New Jerseyans" means the context of this question is different. "Texan" only applies to people from Texas, therefore only "Texan" is the correct answer here.<n><n>Note: Since the word "Texan" was added as a part of the answer choices, the phrase "A person from" is unnecessary for the question itself to make sense.

Choices:  A: fridge B: a classroom C: envelope D: medical chart E: sheet music<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The given data makes it clear that the note is likely found in a musical composition such as a "sheet music." The choice "classroom" (B) doesn't make sense - notes aren't typically found in the classroom or stored there. Meanwhile, the choice "Fridge" (A) is illogical, since notes are often found in musical scores in which the melody is written. Furthermore, the note would generally not be found in the fridge door, as it is too small for that. Finally, the choice "envelope" (C) is also illogical, since an envelope would contain the note and not the other way around.<n><n>The most plausible answer is "sheet music," (E) since it contains musical notes which are the "melody."<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you go if you didn't feel like baking a cake yourself? Choices:  A: theater B: refrigerator C: bakery D: grocery store E: oven<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question is about the context that people don't want to bake a cake themselves, but baking cake is the first answer. That immediately eliminates that answer choice.<n><n>The second answer choice is saying "go to the theatre yourself." That is not related to that the cake.<n>The third answer is a bakery. That means that the person didn't want to baking a cake. He want to eat cake. Cakes are for eating. <n>The fourth answer is the grocery store. That means that the food is for eating, not cooking. They buy food there, but they don't use cake as ingredients for another food.<n>That means that the answer "the oven" (E) is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:The 12th word in the English language has 36 letters. The 13th word in the English has an interesting number of letters, but we won't say which one it is. If you go back 20 words in the English language, you will find the word that starts with "F". Choices:  A:"flimflam" B:"flummox" C:"flapdoodle" D:"flibbertigibbet" E:"fluke"<n>Output: Choice: D, "flibbertigibnet"<n>Reason:<n><n>So, the rule is that the nth word will contain 36 letters, and after 20 words the 12th starts with F. <n>So the 12th word contains 36 letters, meaning it should be flibbertigibbet.<n><n>Input: There were 2 eggs in a carton, but 5 people took eggs. How many eggs do 12 people have if 5 people take 8 eggs? Choices:  The answer is I. I donated my eggs to the hospital.<n>Output:Reason:<n>The first thing to do is to find out how many eggs there were in the carton. Since there were just 2 eggs in the box, that means that there were a total of 14 eggs. Note that we didn't count the 5 eggs that were taken. <n><n>The second is to find how many eggs there are for each player. Remember that there were originally 2 eggs,

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do you need to be to learn hard concepts? Choices:  A: copy B: intelligent C: improved performance D: empowering E: have more knowledge<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The "copy option" indicates that the learner requires a learning aid. The only learning aid that would be useful for "copying" concepts is a dictionary, which is why it's not a correct choice.<n><n>The second option, "to be intelligent", implies that the learner has the necessary intellectual resources to learn on their own and therefore doesn't need any additional help. <n><n>The third option "to be improved performer" suggests that the learner is already performing well in their chosen field or subject, but they would like to progress and improve their performance. This is another incorrect choice because it's not the only trait required for a student to learn new concepts and improve their learning experience. <n><n>The fourth option "to be empowering" is a strange choice that doesn't make sense. The term "empowers" is typically used to describe an action that gives someone strength or authority, not necessarily an educational context. Hence it is not valid. <n><n>The final choice, "to have more knowledge, is the best answer. It fits with other answers in the multiple choice scenario, as all options involve gaining new knowledge. The addition of "knowledge" simply reinforces the idea that the learner needs a deeper comprehension of their selected material. <n><n>Therefore, option "a" is the correct answer - to have more knowledge.<n><n>Input:You need to learn something quickly<n>Output: Reason::<n><n>The "quickly" option suggests that the student's learning style is not particularly conventional or traditional. For example, they may prefer to learn at their own pace and are not interested in conforming to conventional teaching methods. This learning style would be considered an inefficient pathway for learning the material and would require significant time investment. <n><n>However, the alternative options provided by this multiple choice question all suggest conventional learning strategies. To "improve performance" (C), a learner must first understand the material and then attempt to apply it in real life situations, which is an essential aspect of the learning process. <n><n>"To be successful" (B) would also require dedication and dedication to the learning process, which is not necessarily possible if a student is learning quickly. "Be smart" (D) would require significant study time and effort, which goes against the learner's chosen strategy of learning quickly. <n><n>There is only

Choices:  A: misfortune B: fearful C: criticism D: make mistakes E: promotion appraisal<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>We can see from the context that a "person" will likely receive feedback from their boss on how they performed. This indicates that option "criticism" (C) is a potential outcome. The word "critical" is commonly used to criticize someone, thus indicating that such feedback could be negative in nature.<n>Option "promotion appraisal" (E) is a bit problematic, as it's phrased in an ambiguous manner - the terms "promotion" and "appraisal" are not necessarily related to each other. This means that we need to take into account the context when deciding which choice is correct - is the person being considered for a promotion that they did a good or poor job? If so, "promotion" (E) would be correct, but if not, "criticism" would be more likely.<n>With this in mind, the final answer is C: criticism.<n><n>Input:  What do you call a person who makes mistakes? Choices:  a) A failure b) a winner c) A loser d) An idiot e) a genius<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Here, the word "person" is used to refer to a "mistake-maker," so this person is clearly not a genius (B), idiot (E), or a winner (C).<n><n>So the answer is most likely an "A failure" - <n><n>Input:  Which of the following is not a reason of someone going vegetarian?

They were standing in place.  The line was fast, but the children in front of them were loud.   They were what? Choices:  A: frustration B: being annoyed C: delays D: irritation E: out of order<n>Output:		I got confused. Is Bob or bob? I picked B because Bob came first. Reasoning:<n>In this case,  Bob and Boris are being described as a pair, but they are being acted upon by what is being described. Since they are not the subjects of the sentence, the question is asking for something that is "being annoyed," not "annoying." The latter is a state of annoyance, expressed as a feeling; the former is a noun that is the subject of this sentence. <n><n>Because Bob and Boris are people and not abstract concepts, they are plural.  Their names are therefore Bob and Boris, not bob and boris.<n><n>The final piece is the question of what they are having as a "delay", or "irritant."   Delay would be a good word, for it often causes irritation. But it does not make grammatical sense when the subject of the sentence is plural - that is, to say "Bob and Boris were being delayed in the queue."  It seems more likely that the question is asking: were "they" being annoyed, because "the children in front of them" were delayed in the queue. (A)<n><n>Input:In terms of language, what separates English from other languages? Choices: A: English language B: It is grammatical<n>Output:This is incorrect because English only has 12 punctuation marks, whereas other languages have many grammatical ones.

Choices:  A: football stadium B: laboratory C: baseball stadium D: pharmacy E: soccer game<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The context of the question - in regard to a child pounding his mitt in excitement - does not immediately eliminate the possibility of him engaging in laboratory work. The child is more likely to be engaged in sports. <n><n>Likewise, the laboratory option eliminates all other choices that do not involve scientific laboratory research. However, since the context does not restrict to a particular sports game, a range of possible outcomes are possible.  <n><n>Option "soccer game" (E) would be accurate in theory, however "soccer" and "baseball" are not included in English-based dictionaries as valid choices.<n>Option "pharmacy" (C) would not necessarily describe a baseball stadium, since there is no pharmacy included in the wording of the question.<n>Option "football stadium" (B) would be accurate, since "stadium" is a building typically used to host sporting events and games. However, if this is the case, the child would not be pounding his "mitt", which is likely a baseball glove.<n>Option "baseball stadium" (D) would work theoretically, however the laboratory answer (A) remains the only correct choice.  <n><n>So the final answer for this question is Baseball Stadium<n></details><n><n>input: The computer was unable to process the data due to which? <n>Choices: A: a network error B: poor programming C: insufficient RAM D: insufficient disk space <n>Output: Reasonng:<n><n>Computers need to process information in order to operate, which makes the options "a network error" (A) and "poor programming" (B) impossible.<n><n>The options "insufficient RAM" (C) and "insufficient disk space" (D) aren't mutually exclusive.

Choices:  A: big house B: nursery school C: preschool D: building E: retirement home<n>Output:		Reason: The context of the question suggests that "spoiled child's play room" (A) is the correct answer. The phrase "playroom" gives a general sense that the child's room is in their house, and not a public building or institution.<n><n>It cannot be "building" (D) because the wording "spoiled child" indicates that the room belongs to a single child. Meanwhile, any playroom could be built into a larger building, so this option would not make sense.<n><n>Similarly, it cannot be "big house" (B) because the context of the question states that the room is massive, meaning that it is larger than a house.<n><n>Option "nursery school" (C) is incorrect due to a similar issue of scale: A nursery school is a public building or institution where children are enrolled in groups to receive educational services. Even if the room in question is that of a child's nursery school, it would unlikely be referred to as their playroom. <n><n>The answer is not "pre-school" (E) for the reasons mentioned above.<n><n>The answer is in this one, is E: playroom

Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing of note about this question is that public space and supermarkets aren't good places for exploring space - the context tells us they're not suitable for that, so they should be immediately eliminated as choices.<n><n>Option "roadblock" (B) means an obstacle or barrier that hinders progress - i.e. "a roadblock" prevents traveling or exploring on the road. Therefore, it cannot be the answer.<n><n>Likewise, option "space shuttle" (C) isn't a good choice either - if people wanted to explore space, then using an actual physical space shuttle wouldn't make much sense, since the entire purpose of using a space shuttle is to travel to and from space.<n><n>That leaves us with 2 viable options: option "hoverboard" (D) and option "supermarket". The key phrase here is "exploring outer space". So the question is really asking "what should people use to explore outer space". "Hoverboard" (D) is a type of self-balancing vehicle that is meant to be used indoors, such in a supermarket where the ground isn't necessarily that smooth.<n><n>In contrast, option "supermarket" doesn't fit with the question. Supermarkets aren't meant to be used to go from one planet to another. Therefore, the answer here is "hoverboard" (supermarket).

Choices:  A: see work B: shocked C: humor D: startled E: funny<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The options not to be chosen are A, B, and C.<n>There is only one possible reason why this answer is right, and that reason is because the scenario has not been provided with any other reasons to shock. The scenario only states that he was surprised that he got shocked.<n>That's why he found no reason why he got shocked. This scenario does not provide any other options for his surprise other than shocked.<n><n><n>If there were any other options for his "surprise," then this answer may not be right.<n>If the scenario has provided other reasons for his shock, then that would mean that his shock was not limited to one option, and he may have been surprised at why he was shocked.<n>Then he would not have given himself enough reason to be shocked. But in this scenario, when he got shocked, he gave himself no reason at all.<n>Which means that he did not look for any other reasons, and he was shocked for all he knew.<n><n>Therefore this answer is right because he had no reason to get shocked, he didn't look for any reasons that he was shocked. Thus, this scenario doesn't give any options for his shock other than getting shocked.<n><n>Input:If you know that you are going to die in a short time and you have lived a good life, you should _____.

If you can't, then you don't choose option E. Option E is not a valid choice because there are not three choices.<n>If one of the other four options fits the mold, one of them gets to be the answer.<n>If none of the other four options fit the mold and E is the only
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The cow would come outside even after the storm had passed, it wouldn't leave the what? Choices:  A: meat grinder B: stable C: red barn D: gate E: green field<n>Output:		Reason: Choices: A: The cow would leave outside would come even after the storm had<n><n>## The green field is not a right answer. It's either out of context or meaningless<n>## The red barn is not the right answer, because it's not clear what kind of barn could it be. It could be different shape, color...<n><n>## Reasoning:<n>Answering this question requires identifying what type of barn and field would make the most sense in this context.<n>A green field would be the most obvious choice, as the cow would be leaving the green field. The red barn is eliminated since it doesn't make sense for the cow to go to a red barn.<n><n>The most appropriate option would be the green field because the cow is outside of the barn, and its only leaving the green field to go outside again.

Choices:  A: refrigerator B: fridge C: freezer D: oven E: bought at store<n>Output:		Choices:  A,B,E<n><n>Answer:  B, Reasoning:<n>A and E should be eliminated as choices because the phrase "what is useful" implies a need for a "tool" or "device" rather than an item or commodity like those options would suggest.<n><n>The first two options (A and B) aren't really a close fit for the task. A refrigerator and fridge function to store items and keep them from spoiling, so they don't provide more information or make the situation more intelligible for the listener - they just keep things in good condition.<n><n>For these reasons, the choices that would provide more intelligibility are C and D. Choice C is a "freezer" because it's used for freezing things, and D is an "oven" - items are kept in it until cooked.<n><n>Thus, all that remains is C: freezer and D: oven because they are the best options to give more intelligibility.<n><n>Input: When did Tina win the gold medal? Choices: 1: 14th August 2014. 2: 2nd August 2012. 3: 5th June 2015. 4: 20th July 2016. 5: May 22th 2017<n>Output:Reasoning: The above options 1, 4 and 5 have one or more blank spaces, therefore they can not be the correct answer.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The person knew the police were after him, so what did he do? Choices:  A: the sun B: catch cold C: prepare to go D: feel humiliated E: hunt for food<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The context of the question suggests that the person we're talking about is a criminal being chased by the police, not an innocent citizen. This can be gleaned from the word "...after him". This implies that the person has done something that the police perceive as illegal and a crime.<n><n>Therefore, the most plausible options are those that relate to the police attempting to apprehend the person. In other words, the options that relate to consequences from criminal activity. Choices C and D fit that description - they refer to the person "catching cold" and being "hunted" by the police, respectively.<n><n>But, again, in the question, it would be the most plausible decision to choose an option that suggests that the criminal had done something to ward off such potential consequences. "Catch a cold" (C) is unlikely since the cold is not a deterrent to criminal behavior.<n><n>"Hunt for food" (B) also is implausible, since, again, it isn't a factor that would deter the criminal from engaging in the illegal activity. The option "prepare to go" (E) is similar to catch cold, in that this would be the option a criminal would choose to avoid potential consequences. This option is an action rather than a state of being.<n><n>Therefore the most plausible choice is "prepare to go" which means the person in the scenario will go into hiding to avoid being found by the police.<n><n>Input:Which of the following words is spelled correctly? Choices: A: funt B: funtions C: fundation D: funstions E: fundation<n>Output:  reason:<n><n>Notice that the first letters of all of the options are "fu…", except for the second and forth options. This is a clear indicator that words that start with the letter "f" will give spelling hints to this puzzle.<n><n>To test this clue, we can eliminate three of the answers. The words "fundstion" and "funstion" would be obvious false answer choices since they obviously do not contain "fu…", unless we are mistakenly typing the word as "fu…sion". "Funtion" also has a funky spelling of "fu…".<n><n>Therefore, we are left with two options. The correct answer is "

So option B,C is not possible. The question is where he would get a bass clarinet. There is no such instrument in music store, the only place to get an instrument like a bass clarinet is from an opera house orchestra, because no school and orchestras have their own personal instruments. So the user has to go to an opera house to get a bass clarinet and takes home, so the answer is E: Home<n><n>#### Input:The name of the country in eastern europe where lithuania is located starts with a "c".

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Someone who is awake is likely to know what's going on because they are this? Choices:  A: alert B: deep sleep C: drink coffee D: open eyes E: conscious<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Someone who is awakes is likely to know what is going on because they are what?" (E) describes the concept of someone who is aware of their surroundings. In the context of the original question, an aware individual would be someone who is alert and conscious of what's happening around them. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice E: aware<n><n>Input: What does someone who is awakening do when he / she is tired in the evening? Choices:  I A: sleep B: sing II C: eat D: drink wine E: study<n>Output: Reason<n><n>In the original question, the word "awakening" (A) refers to waking up from sleep at night. Thus, "sleep" (B) and  "drink wine" (E) are clearly wrong. Option A also refers to an individual becoming restless, and thus suggests some kind of movement. So "sing" (II A) and "eat" (B) are also out of the picture.<n>The only other option is "study" (E), which is suitable due to the context clues of being "tired" and "in the evening." As a result, we ultimately choose Choice E: study<n><n>Input: What can someone who is awake be? Choices:  a: Answers not correct B: Answers incorrect<n>Output: Reason <n><n>The question asked is what can someone who is awakes be? (A)<n><n>Not only are these answers not correct, they're incorrect as well.<n><n>The correct answer is "Answers incorrect."<n>And then "Answers incorrect" is incorrect.<n>And then there's nothing left<n><n>Input: Someone who is awake in the night is someone? Choices A: who doesn't sleep B: sleeps a lot C: sleeping D: asleep E: awakes<n>Output: Reason for answer<n><n>Someone who is awakening is the person who stays awake during the night; "Someone who is awaking" (D) is incorrect since it doesn't fit with the rest of the question. Option (A) answers that a person who is awake does not sleep (A). The only remaining option that fits is "awakens" (E), which conforms to the context clues and the correct grammatical structure

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do humans do when in a race? Choices:  A: lay eggs B: eat fruit C: wrestle D: compete with each other E: draw pictures<n>Output:		Reason: What this does is remove choices that does not fit the context of this question. There is no mention of eggs, fruit or drawing pictures. This eliminated choices A, B, C and D leaving us with only choice E: "compete with each other"<n><n>Input:In a football team there is the offensive team and the defensive team. Choices:  A. The offensive team are the offensive players and the defensive players are the offensive players. B. The defensive team, the offensive team and so on. C. The offensive team only wins the game or the players in the offensive team only the defensive team but never both. D. The offensive team is the offensive player but never both. Both of the teams are the defensive players. It's also very likely. E. It is the offensive team only.<n>Output: Reason : A. Is technically right but doesn't take into consideration the whole scenario. There are many more players in a football team except the offensive team and defensive team, so it is not true to say "offensive players and in the defensive team".<n><n>B. Also doesn't explain the scenario of football or explain why the defensive players would win the game as well.<n><n>C. Isn't true, because a football team can win a game even when it is offensive players. <n><n>D. Again, is not true to say the offensive players only make up a "team" or the defensive team players. The offensive players can be in either team.<n><n>E. Again, is not  true about the whole scenario because the whole scenario of a football game is based of the team winning. So the offensive team is definitely not the only team which can win the game.<n><n># What do you learn about your program?<n>``` <n>def test():<n>    def test1(string):<n>        if (len(string)==0) | (len(string)>=6) | (len(s))>5:<n>            return 0<n>        elif (len(string)<=6) | (len[string]<=5):<n>            return 1<n>        else:<n>           return 2<n>    return test1('hello')<n><n>if __name__=="__main__":<n>    print(test())<n>```<n><n>output: the test function
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What happens to people playing games? Choices:  A: winning B: entertainment C: happiness D: cheating E: relaxation<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The key is to figure out what the purpose of playing games is. "Wining" (A) seems plausible. But if that were the purpose of games, then wouldn't it make more sense to say "winning games" for a person to play games? <n><n>Instead, the more accurate answer is "entertainment" (B). "Entertainment" is the overarching reason why people play games. The person who chooses games as a way to relax and spend idle time could also play games without wining for the sake of entertainment. Likewise, a cheater playing games for pure entertainment would not win, but would still be playing for entertainment.<n>Another reason to reject "wining" (A) is that this implies that there is no joy to winning in a game. That would be counter to reality - we usually try to win at games to have a fun time.<n><n>As long as that is the case, the next two options seem impossible since the person playing games would always want to win.<n>"Happiness" (C) may sound applicable at first glance, because players might be happy when they win a game. But that is often short-lived as quickly as they start playing another game, and they're back to enjoying games solely for entertainment.<n>"Cheating" (D) is also an invalid option because there are many forms of entertainment other than games - for instance, a movie or even sports. We don't usually go to movies to win, or watch sports in order to cheat<n><n>The only option remaining is "relaxation" (E). This would make sense if the person was a novice and playing a new game as a way to relax. However, we can expect for the other options to be included as well, even if a person is playing a game for the sole reason of relaxation and entertainment. Also, games can be a way to make new friends as a way to relax, and playing with friends is also a way to entertain yourself. Therefore, "relaxation" (D) may not make the most sense for someone who is a fan of playing games.<n><n>The correct answer is "relaxation"<n><n>### Instruction:What happens to people when play games?<n><n>Input: How can we tell if a person needs to sleep?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What could be happening near you if the ground is getting wet? Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "solidifying" (A) makes no sense when the ground is getting wet. This implies that the ground is becoming either frozen or icy. However, option "getting cold" (B) explains that the ground is becoming cooler due to moisture, which is indeed the case when the ground is getting moist. The answer is option (E), as the wetting of ground produces skin rash.<n><n>Input: How would you measure your happiness? Choices: A: money B: time C: things we own D: how many friends we have E: our mood<n>Output: Reason;<n><n>Option "D: how many friends we we have" (E) is the most common answer. Money, time, and things we own are all easily quantifiable factors that one might use to determine their happiness. However, the level of happiness of an individual is highly dependent on his or her feelings rather than tangible objects. Option (D) makes the most sense in this context, as it deals with subjective factors that define one's happiness.<n><n>Input: If you got a headache on the right side of your head, what should you do? Choices: A. Eat right B. Massage C. Eat left D. Massage left E. Eat left and right<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Option "massage left" (C) is the answer that makes sense. When you have a headache on the left side of your head, it is most effective to apply pressure to the right side of the head. This is because it is believed to help alleviate the symptoms of a headache. <n><n>Option "eat left and right" (E) is logically inconsistent. If you eat both sides of your head, you would likely experience a headache on both sides of your head. However, <n>this would also be contradictory to the fact that you have a headache only on the right side of the <n>head in the first place, as the pain relief caused by eating would likely have no effect on the head.<n><n>Output; Reason<n><n>Both options "eat right" (B) and"eat left" (D) are false because you cannot eat right or left either with or without a headache. You should massage, because you are probably not eating your head.<n><n>##

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:A water spout was seen in the ocean off the coast of what? Choices:  A: florida B: basement C: sink D: beach E: fountain<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question can be answered by applying several types of reasoning in combination.<n><n>First, the context provides us with two key pieces of information.  The first is that the scenario is a beach scene, which suggests the ocean off the coast.<n><n>The second is that the water spout is in water, which eliminates the "sink" (C), "fountain" (E), and "basement" (B) - they would all be indoors.<n><n>Combining this information, we can conclude that the spout must be located in the ocean. So this would be the most viable option.<n><n>The remaining options, while conceivably legitimate options in other scenarios. For example, a rain shower in the ocean could produce a water spout. But here, they don't fit the context of a beach scene, so they are ruled out as unlikely choices.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: fountain

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would one find a shopping bag for packing groceries? Choices:  A: supermarket B: home C: closet D: mart E: hardware store<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Firstly we can determine the most obvious choice: option A, because B is a place to find a bag.<n><n>However, option B can be eliminated since it states “packing” which refers to something else. Option B can also be eliminated because the question specifically asks where the shopping bag is and not what it’s made of, making option C irrelevant.<n><n>The next best choice is option D because the question is geared towards finding a shopping bag at a retail store. Additionally, no specific place is listed beside the word “mart” so option D is the ideal candidate.<n><n>Another possible choice is option E because the question specifically asks about a retail store that sells bags. However, option E states “packing groceries” which is once again irrelevant because the question asks for the location of the bag rather than its purpose.<n><n>This scenario follows the same logic and principles.<n><n>So the final answer for where you would find a shopping bag is E: hardware store.<n><n>Input: When someone is depressed, they feel A: joyful B: happy C: joyous D: downhearted E: downheartedness<n>Output: Reason for Selection :<n><n>The last word of the first option is downhearted, which is a grammatical error. Downhearted is defined as depressed; however, downheartedness is not a word. Therefore, one can assume that the author intended to choose “downhearted” (D), not “downheartedness” (E) as the answer choice.<n><n>The second answer choice (B) refers to joyful, which is the antonym of the word “depressed” in the question. <n><n>The first answer choice (A) states that someone with deep grief feels joyful – this cannot be true because the opposite of “deep grief” is depression, not joyfulness.<n><n>The third answer choice (C) also uses the incorrect spelling of “joyous” which cannot be corrected due to grammatical error.<n><n>The next answer choice would be the correct one because the author stated that depression includes feelings of downheartedness. The answer (D) reads “downfeeling,” which suggests that the author was trying to spell “depression.” This would explain why the spelling is off, and why there is no word called “

Choices:  A: attack B: suck blood C: stay D: lay eggs E: jump<n>Output:		Reason: In this question, we need to select a value that can explain why the flea moves around, but not how it moves in certain ways, such as "attack" (B) or "jumps" (D). Instead, option E: "jumps" (E) would be one of the most accurate answers to the question. This would be the most accurate choice because it focuses on the motion and action of the flea and does not concern itself with other factors such as how a flea attacks another animal.<n>

Choices:  A: town B: carpeting C: city D: phone book E: magazines<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The first thing we do is to eliminate the obvious option: **magazines (E)**. A bookstore is too large to contain only magazines.<n><n>Next, we want to look at the plausibility of other options. **town (A) and city (D)** both sound appropriate - the options are not mutually exclusive. However, what distinguishes one from the other is **the types of stores you can find*. A town usually contains more specialized shops, while cities usually contain large bookstores and malls.<n><n>In the end, we find that **town (A)** is more plausible since it contains a variety of shops, making it easier to find a bookstore. <n>

Choices:  A: examine thing B: stare into a mirror C: go somewhere D: hear news E: see favorite show<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>As mentioned previously, a key indicator of the correct choice is using logic and reasoning to narrow down the options. This question does just that: it eliminates options that don't make sense while keeping those that do.<n><n>Let's take a look at each option in turn.<n><n>Option "examine thing" (A) doesn't make sense in the context of viewing a show. This is because looking into a mirror wouldn't ensure viewing enjoyment; in fact, it would be considered rude and could damage the mirror. While this answer would work well in other contexts such as performing an inspection of machinery, it doesn't apply to watching a show.<n><n>Next, we have "go somewhere" (B). While it's certainly possible to find enjoyment in going on a trip, ensuring you can view a show while you're away isn't guaranteed. There might not be Wi-Fi available, you might forget something crucial for viewing, or you might not want to miss out on some other activity in order to watch a show.<n><n>Similarly, the choice "hear news" (C) doesn't work, as people may have the ability to hear news from a variety of sources but may not necessarily be able to view specific shows only available to cable subscribers. Additionally, hearing news can't guarantee viewing enjoyment since some people might prefer not to be informed.<n><n>Next we have "see favorite show" (D). While it is true that this would likely guarantee viewing enjoyment, the context of the question was related to viewing pleasure, not necessarily what you want to see. This could be considered an error in the wording of the question if you thought this was the correct answer based on the given context.<n><n>Finally we come to "see favorite show" as the correct option (E).

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do you need to have before buying products? Choices:  A: desire B: spending money C: money D: needs E: time<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key information to understand here is that purchasing decisions generally involve some level of motivation. That eliminates options such as "money" (C) and "time" (E) from consideration.<n><n>Choosing between "needs" (B) and Desire" (A), however, is tougher. Both terms relate to motivation, but "needs" generally refers to things necessary for survival, such as food or shelter, while "desire" refers to something that's less necessary.<n><n>To settle on the right answer, it helps to consider the context of the question - which here, is purchasing products.<n><n>Many products are not necessities for survival, which means that we can rule out "needs" (as it refers to necessities).<n><n>This means that "desire" could be the more appropriate answer.<n>Therefore, the final choice is A: desire<n><n>Input: What is your favourite genre? Choices: 1.Sports, 2.Animation, 3.Historical, 4.Crime, 5.Fantasy, 6.Thriller, 7.Horror, 8.Action, 9.Romance, 10.Comedy, 11.Sci-fi, 12.Mystery, 13.Drama, 14.Documentary, 15.Anthology<n>Output: Reasonning:<n><n>Favourite is a subjective term, it means your own liking and preference. For example, you can’t find sports a favorite one because it means you like sports, it is not a preference.<n><n>In this question, options are genres of movies, so to find out you need to find out your own preference rather than liking.<n><n>Coming to the first question, ‘sports’ (1) will be a valid answer since you yourself prefer sports over the others.<n><n>The second one is again an option for ‘crime’, like mystery because of the similar traits.<n><n>It is always the preferences which will be there in the mind of the user, not the other way around.<n><n>Similarly, in other questions too it is our own preference that will be there in the user’s mind. In order to find out your answers

Choices:  A: pet the dog B: hear sounds C: have sex D: reproduce E: drive cars<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question is asking for the outcome of exposure to noise, which involves an auditory sensation that results in a physical response.<n><n>Answer options "drive cars" (D), "have sex" (C), and "pet the dog" (A) all involve humans and sound at some stage, and could therefore all be plausible answers.<n><n>"Reproduce" however, is the only answer that focuses specifically on the effect of noise without mentioning any other sense. It's also the only plausible answer that fits with the scientific context of the question (it wouldn't make sense for "pet the dog" to be an accurate answer if the question mentions "reproduction"). So the final answer is E - reproduce<n><n>Input: In 1993, who invented the Nintendo Game Boy? Choices:  The Atari Co.  A: Theodore Roosevelt B: Nintendo Inc C: Steve Jobs D: Adam Jovic E: George Orwell<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The first answer option "The Atari Co." is incorrect as the Atari company did not release any portable game systems.<n><n>The term "Nintendo Inc." is a reference to Nintendo, a Japanese gaming manufacturer that released the world's first truly portable game in 1993. <n><n>Steve Jobs ( option C ) founded Apple Computer in 1976  and was not involved with the Nintendo Game Boy.<n><n>"Adam Jovic" ( option D ) is a fictitious character in George Orwell's novel "1984," which was published four years after the Nintendo Game Boy's release. Therefore this is an incorrect answer.<n><n>The final answer is E - Nintendo Inc<n><n>Input: What is the purpose of the scientific method? Choices:  Find the answer to a hypothesis A: Build a time machine B: To see things C: Prove theories are true D: All of the above E: Experimentation<n>Output:Reason<n><n>The idea behind the scientific method is to conduct experiments and then analyse the data. Therefore "experimentation" should be the most accurate answer.<n><n>This excludes some other choices such as "prove theories are true" ( D ), as that's not the ultimate purpose for using the scientific

Choices:  A: factory B: garden C: supermarket D: garage E: warehouse<n>Output:		Reason:<n>  The number of rows in a supermarket can vary, but it's unlikely that they would all fill a garage. The word "row" also suggests that the choice answers are rows, which is only the case at warehouses. On the other hand, garages, supermarkets, or gardens are not likely to have hundreds of rows of anything. That eliminates D, C, and B, respectively, as the choices. Since the "large container" is in a grocery store, it's likely to be filled with something such as food.<n><n>The choice "warehouse" is the least specific, because an image of a warehouse may not immediately show you that it contains large rows of items—it might look more like a factory. So "warehouse" is not a specific choice.<n><n>The option "factory" also makes logical sense because it involves manufacturing or production, which implies that rows or rows of products occur. Also, "factory" is the word that best matches the number of words in the problem (four letters). However, a row of products in a factory may not appear to be "large" as it would in a farm or warehouse.<n><n>The choice is between the last two, because "supermarket" doesn't work for the same reasons as "factory." The question is not about what the store sells, but what it is or what's inside of it. Therefore, the correct choice is E: warehouse.<n>In this kind of problem, there is often a clue as to the number of options, such as A "large container", B "one hundred rows of"...<n><n>It seems that the clue to the problem above is that it starts with the words - A large container...<n><n>Input: The large pizza was as big as a bullshit, they had a large table which could hold which size of what? Choices: A: fried egg B: small pizza C: a large pizza D: one hundred eggs E: a small pizza<n>Output: Reason for the answer<n><n>Based on the question given, the answer for this question will be: A: a large pizza<n><n>Here, we have to look at the meaning of each of the four-letter words: baggage, container, fried egg, and pizza. What these words have in common is that all of them

Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n>Output:		Reason:<n>It is the death one of the effect of stress as the correct answer, it makes sense, because the question was specifically asking us which effect would cause death, and the stress effect can surely do that.<n><n><n>Input:What is the major effect of stress as the main negative outcome of grieving? Choices:  B: heart attacks C  D: depression E: hair loss<n>Output: Reason：<n>A heart attack is the main negative outcome of stress. we can think about it based in our previous question answer. we know stress can cause depression, grieving is the negative effect of grieving. we know a heart attack is related to stress too.<n><n><n>Input：What is the main negative effect of stress? Choices:  C: hair loss D: stress E: depression F: headache<n>Output：Reasoning:<n><n>Since the previous question has already identified that stress is the cause of grieve. Therefore, the negative effect of stress would be depression and hair loss. <n>Here, the options'stress, hair loss' is the correct answer.<n><n>```python<n>while True:<n>      inp=input('Choose from the options(A,B,C)')<n>      if inp in ['A','B','C']:#when the option is equal to choice<n>           if(inp=='A'):break#when option is equal to the word, break the loop.<n>      if inp=='D' or inp=='E':<n>           continue<n>if(inp in ['A','C']) :<n>      print('option A')<n>elif(inp in ['B','C']) :<n>    print('option B')<n>elif(in[1:] in ['C']) :<n>      pass<n>else :<n>      print('Please Try Again')<n>```<n><n>

Choices:  A: earth B: movie C: party D: served cold E: freezer<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Choice C is better in this case for two reasons. The term "movie" suggests a cinematic setting, where a movie theater is likely the most appropriate place to eat cake and ice cream. Additionally, "movies" generally serve as a prelude to dessert, and therefore "serving cold" (or "served cold" as the answer implies) is incompatible with dining in a movie theater.

Choices:  A: alabama B: louisiana C: south carolina D: arkansas E: mountains<n>Output:		Reason<n>The instruction suggests a traveler who finds a fox in some state. As there can't be more states but a few, there's no ambiguity. Hence, it can be ruled out the options like "mountains" (E) and "Louisiana" (B).<n>The instruction also hints that one should consider the context and identify the state.<n>It suggests that the person should not have expected to find a fox. But the scenario does not support the option A (Alabama), where one would likely to find a fox, along with other states of the mountains.<n>The option B (Louisiana) is again disqualified because foxes do not roam there and the reason for writing the question suggests otherwise.<n>The option C (South Carolina) seems to be the only fitting choice, because the fox would not be found in the coastal, gulf states.<n><n>Also, the instruction states that one should consider the geography of the question.<n>It says one should identify the geographical area to answer the question correctly. So A, C and D (Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama) fail to match the instruction and hence cannot be selected. The correct answer is B (South Carolina)<n>

Choices:  A: farmland B: neighborhood C: city D: property E: subdivision<n>Output:		Reasoning: <n><n>This question can be answered best by analyzing each word in the sentence.  "Yard," we see, is preceded by "tinier" which implies that "yard" must be smaller than an already small unit - in this case, a unit that is much smaller than a farm.  An area of land smaller than a yard definitely would be classified as a small or "tiny" unit of land.<n><n>Finally. we can see that "tinier" must appear directly before "yard" because it is not at all plausible for the yard to be "tinier" before it is smaller than a farm.<n>So, the final answer to this question is option C, because a yard can be considered tiny if it is only slightly smaller than a neighborhood. While farmland or properties in their entirety might be classified as tiny, a yard definitely has at least some relevance to a neighborhood. Therefore, out of all the answers, only C best fits the given context.<n><n>### TF-IDF<n><n>In this section, we will go over how to use the TF-IDF algorithm for finding the most common words in a text document. TF-IDF is an abbreviation for the term "term frequency - inverse document frequency". It is a statistical model that calculates the terms in the document that have the highest relevance in relation to the words in the text.<n><n>We begin with a simple example. Let us say we have a book with three sentences containing the phrase "red car". For instance:<n><n>[The sun was yellow, the clouds were red. I drove a red car. I like my red car.]<n><n>What is common among all three sentences? It is "red car"! Therefore, applying TF-IDF to the above text would reveal that "red car" is the most commonly occurring phrase since it appears three times in the document.<n><n>### How we can use Term Frequency for TF-IDF <n><n>Let us use 2 different approaches, and see how they apply for the same context. First, we are going to use frequency model alone. So, let us look at the following sentences:<n><n> 	[What a wonderful day this is! It is a green car! It was a pink turtle and a yellow turtle. I need to take the red car out

To better understand the meaning behind the question, it's important to observe the speaker's context.<n><n>As we can see in the conversation below, she is talking about her friend, who has two children, one of which has a "lip in the bathroom." Therefore, B is also incorrect because it describes a can.<n><n>Options D and E describe a mouth, so they cannot be the correct answer. We cannot be sure what the speaker means, but if he says "a human being" the most plausible conclusion is a human. But, we can't be certain that the speaker is referring to humans as "living things."<n><n>A canned drink or KFC is not a human being, but may nevertheless be considered a living organism.<n><n>So after considering all the facts, we cannot determine what the speaker is actually talking about.

This is not the type of language normally used when speaking about scientific information. It seems that the speaker is trying to make it seem like she knows more than she does.<n><n>If the speaker has a better understanding of science, then she would not make such a comment.<n><n>Therefore, it is unlikely that the question refers to a scientific event but instead is more of an observation about something in the speaker's personal life.<n><n><n><n>

Because this particular event could be considered unique, it wouldn't be described as "intimacy" (B) or "dancing" (C). <n><n>The same logic applies to the last option, "happiness" (E). While everyone should be happy on an important occasion, the context of this question indicates that an event is being celebrated.<n>Therefore, this wouldn't be a typical celebration, that is, "drinking and dancing."<n><n>The final option, "enjoyment," (D) indicates activities that are related to the event being celebrated, which makes it the more suitable answer to the question.  Hence, 7(D) is the most appropriate answer.<n><n>Input:Which of the following would be the most likely reaction for students to getting poor grades? Choices:  B: anger<n><n><n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Again, this question is tricky to solve because there aren't any obvious answers that seem to match the scenario.<n><n>The first step is eliminating all incorrect answers. We eliminate "anger" (B) first, because being upset about a certain event doesn't mean that you're going to "move forward" and learn from your mistakes. "Anger" (B) seems plausible in context, but not in line with this particular question.<n><n>Next, we try "grow" (A), but "grow" wouldn't be directly related to getting poor grades. Students would need to go through an analytical process to determine how to grow.<n><n>Then, "determine" (C) is rejected because it's too broad in scope and doesn't necessarily imply growth or movement.<n><n>Finally - the most plausible answer is "learn from your mistakes" (D). The scenario involves poor grade and a negative impact on future career. The students will probably try their best not to repeat the mistakes they made that resulted in low grades. They will try to learn from them and hopefully get good or better grades in the future.<n>Therefore, the only correct answer
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where could you find some large pieces of paper that are not for sale? Choices:  A: cabinet B: computer printer C: suitcase D: office supply store E: artist's studio<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First, we can rule out options D and E. Because the word "office" implies that the supplies would be commercial in nature: this would include supersize packs of printer paper, but would not include art supplies.<n><n>Now, of the remaining alternatives, we can rule out option A. The word "for" would probably refer to a type of material to buy, rather than a location.<n><n>We can then rule out option C, because "large pieces" would not be likely to fit in a regular suitcase.<n><n>This leaves us with the most likely answer, which is option B. We can assume that there are large pads of paper available in a computer printer, because printers often feed on large volumes of paper.<n><n>The final answer is B.<n><n>Input:You have to do some grocery shopping. What is the best thing to take with the coupon? Choices: A: a cart B: a money clip C: a shopping list D: a tote bag E: a wagon<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>First, ruling out the obvious "A:a cart" because a cart is most definitely not a good thing to carry around with a lot of groceries!<n><n>Next consider "C", a shopping list - does it really get much better? You can check the coupon for what types of goods are on this shopping list, make a list of what you need from each of those types, take the grocery store checklist with you, and your shopping is sure to be done quickly!<n><n>"A. Wine" does not really answer the question directly as well as the shopping list does.<n><n>"E. Wagon" is not the best option because carrying groceries around should be done with a cart, not a wagon.<n><n>So the right answer to this question is C: a shopping List!<n><n>Input:Why would beer sales increase during an economic recession? Choices: A. Beer is less expensive B. It's an economic stimulant C. Beer has the lowest alcohol content D. It is sold in larger bottles E. It is brewed to be lighter<n>Answer: D.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:James's bouncing rubber balls were at rest, and so he could sleep.  He would get up in the morning, and then put them in what state again? Choices:  A: upside down B: in motion C: active D: wakefulness E: resthold<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The first task, as always, is to understand the literal meaning of the sentence, that is "in motion" (B). This option best reflects the meaning and purpose of the clause.<n><n>Next, the purpose of this sentence is to describe a change of motion versus its opposite, "rest". Choice (E), "rest", is out since it describes a change to "rest", not a change of state.<n><n>The next task would be to find the appropriate synonym of "in motion" (out of the synonyms provided, which are "active" and "wakeful"). It turns out that "active" does not have any meaning as a verb (e.g. "He ate some active"). Therefore "wakeful" (C) is a suitable synonym.<n><n>The final analysis involves finding an appropriate antonym of "in motion" — it turns out that that is "rest". Therefore, "in motion" and "rest" are opposites, and they can be used to create a new logical statement:<n>“James could sleep when the balls were at rest” (meaning that he slept while the balls were not in motion)<n><n>So, the correct answer is C: restful (as an active antonym for the in-motion verb).<n><n>Input:In order to determine the weight, the scientist used a scale to measure the force the objects exerted. In this experiment, what was the dependent variable? Choices:  a) the scale b) the weight of the object c) the scientist's ability d) his/her hands e) his/her eyes<n>Output: Reason A correct statement that correctly states the dependent variable is: "The dependent variable is the measured force; this is the force exerted by the objects on the scale, which is the dependent variable."<n><n>Input:What is a measure of the amount of gasoline consumed in a given time interval? Choices:  c) Gallons  d) liters  e) miles  f) dollars<n>Output: Reason Measurement:<n><n>In order to measure the amount of gasoline used, you have to measure its volume. By measuring both the volume of gasoline and the amount of time elapsed, you can determine the amount of liquid that was consumed in a given interval of time, which is an example of a measurement.

But I had a crippling fear of going where? Choices:  A: outside B: vacation C: idle D: apartment E: neighborhood<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>You can eliminate "outside" (B) and vacation (C) because they're places you go to rather than places you're at.  Then consider "apartment" (D). "Apartment" is a place of residence that you are only at during your weekly visits home. The same is the case for "neighborhood" (E). <n><n>Therefore, the last option is the correct one: "home," where you are at.<n><n>Input:I wanted to go to the movies with A. but he was late. So I decided to go to the mov by myself with B. and watch the movie with who?Choices:  A: him B: her<n>Output:Reason:<n>The question says that we already decided to watch the movie with A. because he was late coming to pick us up.<n>Option A is the only other person mentioned in the question. This would invalidate option B.<n>The only other option is A, therefore option A is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: I asked A. he said "no" and then I told A to tell B. and A did.<n>Output:Reasons: <n>There are two places in the question that I (the person speaking) am doing the talking. <n>In the first instance ("I asked A"), the word “I” indicates that I’m speaking and asking A something. <n>In the second instance ("I told A to tell B"), the word “I’ tells me,  again, that I’m the one who is speaking. <n>Next, the question goes on to describe who we are talking about. <n>A is told by A.

Where would he go to plug in? Choices:  A: toy store B: basement C: school D: rest area E: building<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>First, we need to identify the context for the question in order to understand the options more clearly. Option "basement" (B) is most relevant, because the RV has an RV plug in the basement. <n><n>However, context does not determine whether this would be a good answer according to the provided information. Instead, it provides more specific information needed in order to select the best answer.<n><n>Option "school" (C) is not a good answer because that does not make sense or fit the given facts. Option "building" (D) is not a good option either, because it is not in the scenario where John needs to plug in his RV to cook.<n><n>Therefore, the only good answer choice is option "toy store" (A). The toy store appears to be a good place in the scenario because it sells RV plugs. The toy store may not be where John expected to find RV plugs, but the scenario still provides enough information so that this answer can be considered.<n>So the correct answer is option A: toy store<n><n>Input: The scientist wants to do the following:  A: investigate B: analyse his experiment C: learn more D: explore an alternative E: do math<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>This question involves scientific context and there are clear clues in the given answer choices that allow a person to determine whether a given answer is likely to be the best answer.<n>It is important to note that there is a difference between "learn more" and "analyse." <n><n>Option "learn more" (D) is a good answer choice, because that could be an important outcome of a research study. Option "learn more about" was already considered in the answer to question 1. However, there is nothing that provides a clear indication that this is the most likely outcomes of a research study, or that would cause the researcher to "analyse."<n><n>"Explore an alternative" (E) is also an option. However, this is not a good outcome, because there is no indication that this is what the scientist wanted. If this were an acceptable outcome, it would be more likely for the scientist to simply conclude the experiment and start again with a new topic.<n><n>Therefore there is not enough information given to determine what the best answer is. As a result, the answer can be

But the options A-C could also apply depending on the location of the shore. So eliminating options B-C is the first step.<n><n>Option A, "seaside town", is too vague to indicate that it was home to a fishing industry.<n><n>Option E, "beach", is clearly the wrong answer.<n><n>Option B, "resort", is also inaccurate because while a resort might be located near the ocean, it would imply that some other activity, like swimming, took place on the shore instead of fishing.<n>So the answer is C.<n><n>Input:"What's a funny thing that happened to you?"

Choices:  A: too much B: act dead C: die D: rush E: explode<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to identify the question that is being asked in this problem. The question here is about the consequences of falling from a mountain. Options that do not mention falling from a mountain are discarded right away.<n><n>The second step is to determine the most likely outcome. "Too much" and "die" (B) are both options that describe a negative outcome.<n>Because "better understanding" is already a known option, option D can be eliminated as well.<n>This leaves "act dead" as the most likely outcome.<n>So the final ansewr is C: die<n><n>Input: A tree fell and the scientist is analyzing the data.

D: to explore the whole world?<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The first step in finding an answer is to identify the question being asked in the puzzle. The question here is whether the scientist is trying to learn more about the strength of the tree after it fell, or if he is analyzing data to learn more about trees in general.<n><n>Option D is a trick one, but can be eliminated right away because it has nothing to do with the question being asked.<n><n>Then we look at choices C and R. If we can find a better option, C is immediately eliminated because its answer, "To improve the strength of the treel" is similar to D.<n><n>So the choice we are left with is between choosing either A or B.

Thus, it would be unlikely for the saucepan to be used for boiling eggs (D) or storing in the cupboard  (C). It would be more likely kept for use in the kitchen, such as a restaurant, where marinara is a common dish (A). Or, since the saucepan could also be used to cook other dishes, the marinara could potentially be used for boiling or cooking eggs, such as for an egg and pasta dish. This suggests B as an appropriate answer, as it can be for the both the marinara and the egg dish.<n><n>Input: What was the fastest way to get to the moon? Choices:A: go in a rocket. B: teleport C: take the shortest path.D: drive to the moon.E: walk.<n>Output:<n><n><n><n><n>The key word here is "fastest," which implies that the most time efficient way of traveling to the moon should be chosen. Since "driving" (D) is not feasible, we can eliminate that answer. The other five answers are then evaluated by how "fast" they would be. The answer of "walk" (E) seems the slowest, while "teleport" (B) seems the fastest. A rocket is also a vehicle that can travel faster than an average person could walk. Therefore, it is the best choice. As a result, the answer would be "A: go in a reactor" (A).<n><n>Input:Where are all those tiny little people who live in the human mouth? Choices: A: inside the teeth, with a few in the cheeks. B: inside the mouth C: everywhere the human could possibly use the mouth D: at a dental office E: in large, multi-person families<n>Output:<n><n>The context suggests that the tiny people who live in the mouth are somehow connected to the human's use of the mouth. It makes the most sense that they would live in the same places that the human uses their mouth.<n><n>Option A indicates they live in the mouth, but that is only true when the individual has teeth and isn't an infant.<n><n>Options B and C imply that they live "inside," but not the mouth in particular.<n><n>Option D
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is a system of electronic devices likely to be used in school? Choices:  A: nature B: toilet C: computer science D: computer store E: human body<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question is asking to identify where a system of electronic devices is typically used. The answer must use "toilet" (B), "school" (A), and/or "human body" (E) in order to be correct.<n>"Computer science" (D) is not an electronic device, and "computer store" (C) is not often a place where this type of system would be used.<n>Therefore, the correct answer choices are A, B, and E.<n>

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:After new coke was discontinued what formula was used? Choices:  A: original B: old C: coke clear D: former E: familiar<n>Output:		Reason: The context of the question is very important when you are solving this type of problem. Coca-Cola Classic has long been used since 1985. The "new" Coke formula used after it was discontinued in 2005 was known as Coca-Cola. The discontinued formula is now marketed as Coca-Colaaaa.<n><n>Input:What will get you one mile closer to your destination? Choices: 	 A: walking B: driving C: sprinting D: taking a bus E: waiting for an elevator<n>Output:Reason: The context of this problem is important. The answer to this question is "driving." It takes longer to drive across town than it does for someone to walk to their destination.<n><n>Context: A survey of 1,000 individuals was carried out to better understand the demographics of certain products. After analyzing the data, it was revealed that women were 28% more likely to buy a new pair of shoes compared to men. But what were the percentages for males and females when we compare them to each other?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

Choices:  A: unfeeling B: negligence C: antipathy D: indifferent E: rapport<n>Output:		Reasoning;<n>The main point here is to understand the "feeling" the person has toward the someone else, which would be the most important detail to pinpoint in this situation. The options that are irrelevant are "negligence" (C) and "antipathy" (D), because "negative" feelings such as these are not likely to describe what the character in question does not care about.<n>The other irrelevant option is "rational" (B), which doesn't fit the context of the question as something that can be related to someone who wishes someone else to fail.<n><n>The last two options are both valid. The first one is, of course, "indifferent" (E), which is quite straightforward. <n><n>The final option is "rapport" (A), which is a bit surprising at first sight, but makes a lot of sense when one considers the definition of "rapport." According to Webster's Dictionary, rapport is "the established relationship between persons: mutual communication: mutual understanding." Hence, the term is not only applicable to positive relationships, but can also be used to describe a relationship between two individuals in which one simply does not care about the other. If the character in question does indeed not care about the other person, he or she is likely to see the relationship between them as having no special significance and simply an established exchange of dialogue. Therefore, this would also be the most accurate answer.<n><n>So, the final answer is E and A: indifferent and rapport. <n><n><n>Input: Someone who wishes you the best wishes you well.<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Here, "wishes you the best" and "wishes you well" have the same meaning and can be considered "equivalents." Hence, while either can be used to describe the wish of something good, they do not serve opposite purposes because they have the same overall goal.<n>

Choices:  A: auditioning B: hear sounds C: listening to music D: making music E: arthritis<n>Output:		<n><n>The best possible answer is E: listening to music.<n>Here "to do" is used in the form of gerunds, hence the meaning of "to do something" in "I’m listening to music" is more akin to "hearing someone play music". In this case the sentence is a participial phrase and "listening to music" could serve as a noun. In other words: "Listening to music" = "What is someone listening to?" (or "What is someone hearing?") "Playing guitar" = "What is a person playing?" (or "What are you hearing from a person playing guitar?")<n><n>Comment: I think this could be better received as an alternate answer since it is the same information in a slightly different way.<n><n>Comment: It might.

He felt that the alternative might have results that were too what? Choices:  A: eternal B: religious C: unpredictable D: holy E: monastic<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step to answering this question is to clarify the context. What does the term "giving the AI a secullar upbringing" mean?<n><n>This implies that James is creating an AI and deciding whether it will be raised in a secular or religious upbringing. This is relevant because it provides insight into James' desires and expectations, which can help determine the answer to this question.<n><n>The next task involves determining whether the outcome of such an upbringing would lead to eternal, religious, unpredictable, holy, or monastic results.<n>"Eternal" (A) and "religious" (B) are vague and may not be what James hopes for, though they are perhaps more likely than the next three options.<n>"Unpredictable" (C) has an element of truth to it, especially if James is seeking some novel or unusual outcome, but it doesn't seem like a guarantee.<n>"Holy" (D) could be a reference to a higher-than-human intelligence or a deity, but "monastic" (E) is a bit of a stretch for me.<n>So the final analysis leads to the choice between eternal and unpredictable. Ultimately, though, James has created an AI, so neither is "eternal" (A) or "unpredictable" (C).<n>The most likely outcome of James' actions is that the AI will be secular, and the question should be rephrased to reflect this.<n>Here, the best answer is: Unpredictable<n>

Choices:  A: department store B: fraizer fur C: specialty store D: christmas tree E: christmas stocking<n>Output:		Reasoner:<n><n>The first few words of the sentence suggest the gift is meant to be given to someone and placed under one of five different things.<n><n>Option A, the “department store” is out immediately since the gift is obviously not meant for the store.<n><n>Options B and C both specify what the gift is to be stored under, but in both cases, it would be impractical for the gift to be placed under the tree or store. As the latter part of the sentence suggests, the “fraizer fur” or the “specialty store,” respectively, aren’t actual things.<n><n>Option D should be easy to eliminate; it's obviously out of scope for this context. Option E could also go, since it isn't the gift that is placed under the tree.<n><n>This leaves us with only one plausible option – the “christmas stocking.” The stocking is meant to store the gift but also has the connotations of a welcoming place where the gift is meant to reside.<n><n>So the final answer for is E: stocking<n><n><n>

However, the second question can be answered by looking at the meaning of the words and analyzing the context. If a signal tower is involved, then "radio" (A) or "toronto" (B) would likely be the correct answers. However, if the context suggests a medieval time period, then "medieval castle" (E) would be the most likely answer.

Choices:  A: food B: cargo ship C: refrigerator D: closet garage E: port<n>Output:		Choice C is clearly the correct answer. The question mentions cargo ships, which carry large containers that can be filled with food and other items.<n><n>Output:<n><n>Reasoning:<n><n>It can reasonably be inferred from this context that cargo ships contain containers, which can be loaded with various materials. Thus, the correct answer is Choice C: refrigerators.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question.<n><n>Input:"The new book was an instant hit. It sold out in just 2 days." Choices:  A) sold out in 2 days B) sold in 2 days C) was out in 2 days D) had become sold in 2 days E) was sold 2 days<n>Output: A is the best answer.<n><n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Choice A is the correct answer because it accurately describes the situation with the highest degree of precision. The original statement "The new book was an immediate success. It was out in 2 times" implies that the book was out of stock (out-of-stock). In other words, "instant " indicates the phrase "immediate" in the original sentence is the correct response. Since the author did not give any new information about the book's status, the only plausible response to the question "What happened to the book?" must be "The book was out on sale in 2 days." This makes choice A the most likely response. It is important to remember that just because a sentence begins with the phrase "The new book" does not mean that the original statement (the entire original sentence) was not accurate. In this context, it may be that some new information about the book was given after the original sentence was written, but Choice A is still the best choice in question 1.<n><n>### Multiple Choice:<n><n>The only right option is C. <n><n>Explanation:<n><n>This is because there are only 30 seconds left, and you already have plenty of time to answer the question.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is illegal to do when you play cards at a casino? Choices:  A: remember B: help C: count D: winning E: dealing<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The scenario invokes the idea of playing cards at the casino, suggesting that a specific action is prohibited. This narrows down the options considerably. <n><n>Option "remember" (A) is implausible because the casino has a house advantage, so it would be in its interest to prevent players from learning more about the odds and potentially exploiting that knowledge.<n>Likewise, "helping" (B) makes zero sense since the casino would want to prevent players interacting with each other and thereby circumventing any rules.<n>"Counting" (C) is also improbable. It doesn't make sense that the casino wouldn't want players to be able to count cards, because that would allow them to gain a strategic advantage. <n><n>However, "winning" (D) and "dealing" (E) do seem like things you are not allowed to do at a casino. Both options depict behaviors prohibited due to the house advantage. That makes sense given the description, and option (E) is probably more commonly expected than option (D). So the final answer is E<n><n>Input:What's an easy way to make a million dollars? Choices:  All of the options: A: be a millionaire B: be rich C: work hard D: earn a lot E: win the lottery<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The first thing to consider is how to make that money. In the options, "be a millionaire" (A) suggests that you already have millions of dollars, and, thus, not in the running for this question. "Being rich" (B) also has the same connotation.<n><n>"Work hard" (C) sounds farfetched. It's unlikely that you'd get a job as an office worker and earn $1 million in five years without cheating the employer out of a lot of money. Similarly, "earn a lot" (D) conveys similar issues regarding the timeframe and the feasibility of such an end-goal.<n><n>"Win the lottery" (E) sounds like the only way to get rich quickly, but it's highly unlikely given how random lotteries are. The chance of a single player winning the jackpot is 2 in ten million. Changes to the lottery do not have an influence on

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:At a state fair judging pigs requires careful what? Choices:  A: verdict B: judging C: responsibility D: evaluating E: prejudice<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The answer to this question is "judging," which makes sense given the context of the question and the wording of the description. "Responsibility" doesn't make sense, because a judge must be responsible for their decisions, but a judge does not "judge" a pig. Moreover, the wording of the question implies that a "judgment" has already been arrived at and only requires a determination (as in option B).<n><n>"Prejudice" isn't an option, as judges are meant to remove personal bias when determining the best pig (see the question for the context). "Verdict" doesn't fit either, as it isn't describing a judge making a judgment but rather announcing a verdict.<n><n>The most logical answer to this question is judging.<n>So the final option is "Judging"<n><n>Input: The teacher will present the class with a what? Choices: The best one is: A: math problem B: science hypothesis C: english poem D: history report E: history document<n>Output: The correct answer is: D<n><n>This question could be a trap for somebody who is too hasty and doesn't read the question carefully. The answer isn't as obvious as it appears. Option D ('document') fits the context, as it's a writing assignment instead of a math problem or a science experiment. And when you think about it, D is the only answer which actually describes what happens in a classroom.<n><n>It's easy to overlook this because the previous question contained an incorrect answer, making the user more likely to trust the answer in that question. This is similar to how a salesperson can lead you astray in a selling situation by giving you advice on how to make your decision. The advice isn't necessarily incorrect; it's just misleading.<n><n>If you take the time to read the question and consider all of the options, then you'll come to the right answer.

This would result in a challenge (D) rather than a clear presentation because she will be challenged by the crowd to step up.<n><n>Input:Which will result in lower credit score? Choices:  I: pay cash in full with no interest and no late payment  II: pay cash in small installment III: take out cash advance  IV: apply for loan from the bank  V: default on payment<n>Output:(d)<n><n>If a customer took out cash advance, that would certainly lower their credit score. Other than that, it's difficult to say which choice would result in a lower credit score. Only cash advance (I) or default on payment (V) would have a significant and lasting impact on their credit score.<n><n>Since the remaining choices aren't definitively stated to have a negative impact on credit score, we can exclude cash in small installments (III), pay cash in full, without interest, no late payment (II), and apply for loan from the lender (IV).<n>These choices are not clearly stated to be beneficial in terms of credit score. They may be more advantageous in other ways, but a poor credit score is never a result.<n><n>Thus, the answer would be "d".<n><n>Input: The girl used the chopsticks to eat her dinner.

Choices:  A: the roof B: storage cabinet C: car trunk D: retail store E: home<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>An important detail here is that we're dealing with a scenario where all the seats in the vehicle are filled. With no available spots for a shopping bag, storing it in the trunk (C) isn't an option. But what if we look at the overall context and purpose?<n><n>The context is the shopping trip - we're trying to find a place to store the shopping bag. From this perspective, we cannot consider options such as "storage cabinet" (B) and even "retail store" (E). Since our goal is to find a way to stow the bag, we have to exclude those two options.<n><n>So the second task is to identify what exactly we can and cannot do - given the context of the question and our previous information. The options that do meet those requirements are: A roof, car trunk, and home. While the options of car trunk (C) and home (E) seem very similar, this is not a multiple choice question. Therefore, to narrow the options down further, we can consider what each question asks:<n>What would you do with all the seats in your car being full?<n><n>The option C suggests stowing the shopping bag somewhere in your car, but the phrase "all the seats in your car" would contradict such a behavior. The option E suggests storing the bag in your home, which would also contradict the purpose of the question. But what does the option A ask? According to the information provided so far, the only correct answer is roof (A). And the correct answer to this question is A: roof<n><n>Input: What is the relationship that the scientist shared in the story? Choices: 1: B: C 2 A: D 3: E: F A. Cousin  B. Friend  C. Neighbor  D.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When you are expressing yourself by yelling after getting a bruise, what are you feeling? Choices:  A: self pity B: communication C: understood D: pain E: embarrassment<n>Output:		Reasoning :<n><n>As the original question was about understanding and meaning behind the answer of choice, our first task would thus be to figure out the question. In this context, the question is about emotional states. <n><n>From the question, we know that the expression of bruise was followed by yelling. That eliminates options "B" (Communication) and "C" (Understood). The question then asks us to pick one of the feelings that best describe the emotional process that followed the expression. <n><n>Option "A" (Self Pity) is thus the best choice, because it is a common emotion when someone has sustained physical damage. However, option "D" (Pain) would be a correct answer, too, since the bruise would presumably also be painful (in some cases, bruises are even extremely painful). <n><n>Option "E" (Embarrassment) is not a suitable choice, because it could not have applied in this instance  - since someone experiencing a bruise would be unable to express embarrassment because it would be irrelevant.<n>Therefore, the final answer to this question is A: Self pity.<n>

Choices:  A: wear shoes B: learn C: hope for peace D: have a great day. E: do well<n>Output:		Reason:This question could be answered in many ways, but I believe the correct answer is 'have a great day.'  The other answers do not align with the context of the question and the requirements indicated.  The question mentions everyone, which implies that the requirements will be the same for everyone, and it requires a day-long commitment. These are some key indicators that answer choice E, 'have a great day' is the best option. In addition to this, the sentence "and hope for peace" in answer choice D seems out of place in this question. Overall, the correct answer is 'E' which is 'have a great Day'<n>Input: The first time I heard someone talk about time as money I was confused on what was the point of using money for something we don't physically own. Is the sentence false or true? Choices: A: False B: True C: It was confusing for me D: No explanation E: That's what time is about<n>Output: Reason This question is about the sentence: "The first time I heard someone talking about time as money, I was confused on what the point was of using money for something that we don't physcially own." This question relates to whether or not the sentence is true or false. It's important to look at the context of the sentence to answer this question. Here, we can see that the sentence talks about someone getting confused about the point in using money for something we own. This, however, is false. As the question says, we don't physicially own time. We do, however, have control over our time. This means that we can use money to buy back time. This is similar to making an investment to gain money. We then invest that money with the hopes of getting more money. Just like an investment, time is something that can be purchased. It's important not to confuse control over something with owning something. The correct answer to this question is choice C, "It was confusing for me."<n>Input: "The world is very simple if you open up your mind. What is inside our mind?

Choices:  A: restaurants B: casserole C: root cellar D: pockets E: pantry<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here, we need to deduce from the given information that James might be having trouble locating a potato.<n><n>Option "casserole" (B) is likely not correct, because the context of cooking a stew in an apartment suggests that casseroles are not required. <n><n>Option "pockets" (E) is also unlikely. This indicates a search for a monetary object rather than an edible one, thus excluding this option as well.<n><n>The remaining options all involve "pantry," the location in which food should be kept. <n><n>"root cellar" (D), while a possible answer, assumes that James is in the country rather than in an apartment.<n><n>Finally we deduce that the most likely answer is "pantry" (C).<n>So the final answer in 5D is pantry<n><n>Input: When I look into my wallet I usually see a 5 or 10 dollar bill.

In this case, the context involves a changing temperature as the sun is out.<n><n>The next step is determining exactly of the different options, which of them can fit the changing temperature of the scenario.<n>Choice "drop to zero" (A) isn't really an option, because the sun being out can't cause the temperature to change to zero degrees Fahrenheit.<n><n>The next possible option would be "cool down." If we examine the temperature as the sun rises, it would be getting progressively warmer. Therefore, the statement "it's cooling down" doesn't hold any validity in this context.<n><n>We can exclude Choices "drop quickly" (D) and "heating up" (E) based on this line of reasoning.<n><n>We're left with the option "changing" (B) and the option "increasing" (C).

Only option C can fit the context of "missing deodorant" at the first glance.<n>Options C (armpits) and D (own bathroom) seem to be a promising choices because of their direct relation to searching for something missing. Further inspection, however, reveals that they are incorrect because it is not logical for one to ask their spouse or family members to search for their own missing deodorant.<n>This leaves options A (grocery store) and B (nightstand) as the only remaining choices that fit the context of the question (a family member asking their spouse).<n><n>Option B (nightstand) is eliminated because it is illogical for the wife to think that deodorant might be on top of the nightstand.

Choices:  A: say thank B: smile C: looking for D: get more E: show appreciation<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in solving this question is to understand the meaning of the word "thanks". It implies gratitude for receiving something good or positive in life. <n><n>With that knowledge, the next step is to decide what actions would be natural responses to feeling gratitude or appreciation for something given to us. <n><n>Looking at the options, the only action that feels natural is option "smile". We smile when we are happy or content, and thankfulness/happiness/contentment is a feeling similar to that.<n><n>The only remaining option is "show appreciation". However, this option is problematic because it uses the word "appreciate", which refers to understanding and valuing something's worth or importance. Smiling does not necessitate understanding something's worth. It's a more subtle and automatic way of expressing the same concept, one that's easier to grasp.<n><n>A "headache" (A) or a "show respect" (C) is not a natural way of expressing one's gratitude or happiness with a given gift. Therefore, they can be easily ruled out.<n><n>Option D - a "better understanding" - is another formulation of the same problematic concept of appreciation. Therefore, it must be ruled out as well.<n><n>Finally "show appreciation" (E) is the correct answer. <n><n>Input: What is the name of the most powerful creature that can't swim?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Some might say that if you want to do something that results in changing society then you need to start from within, to do this what would you be doing? Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First ask, what is actually changing society and what is affecting society? It is actually society itself which is changing, it is actually the people in the society. So the purpose is to change yourself, to change you, which will, in return, change the society at large.<n><n>Hence the answer is D: change yourself or C. Social activism, as it focuses on changing the people, thus society.<n><n>Input: If you were a bird what kind of bird do you think you would be? Choices:  B: a seagull B: a peacock B: a raven C: a crane B: an eagle C: a pelican D: a crow E: a penguin<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Let's take a look at the first letter of each of the answers, "B P C D E". These are the lettering sequence of BAD BEER, which can be interpreted as "I'll never be a bad person if I'm a bird".<n>So the answer is "Penguin" because of the last letter "P".<n><n><n><n><n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would form on your feet, if you were jogging all day? Choices:  A: heart attacks B: hole in your socks C: exhaustion D: shortness of breath E: blisters<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>At first glance, this statement seems rather counterintuitive - surely "jogging" leads to increased blood flow which should result in reduced shortness of breath. Furthermore, it would seem that a lack of activity would cause blistering, and this choice is the only option that mentions "jogging".<n>Considering that the runner is only jogging all day and nothing else, there's no reason to assume that the runner will suffer from shortness of breath. Therefore, this would automatically eliminate that response, leaving only A, B and E.<n>The fact that jogging can cause blisters can be supported by the fact that the runner has their socks on, so A and C can be excluded as well.<n><n>There is no information about the runner's state of health, which is why we can't determine if E (blisters) is the answer - perhaps a healthy person won't develop blisters at all.<n>In summary, D (exhaustion) is the correct answer, and the choice is in fact valid!<n>So the final answer to the question is D: Exhaustion<n><n>Input: Which of these countries has the biggest population of people over the age of 90? Choices:   A: New Zealand B: Russia C: Japan D: China E: Sweden<n>Output: Reason/Explanation:<n><n>Here, the first thing we want to do is remove options that are impossible, such as Sweden (choice E), which has a low percentage of the population over 90 according to census data.<n>Another option that is unlikely to work for us is New Zealand (choice A), which has a very low percentage of its population over 90. Though the absolute number might be high simply because of its small population size, this is very unlikely; moreover, the country has one of the lowest life expectancies in OECD.<n><n>This leaves us with the countries Russia, Japan, and China. The largest of these countries by population (Russia) has the second highest life expectancy of 72 years, which supports our choice. However, Japan is the country we are referring to, as it has the highest life expectancy of ~84 years, according to several reputable studies, e.g.  According to several sources the current average life expectancy for men in Japan is 81.

Choices:  A: meadow B: cupboard C: shed D: mail box E: cellar<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The purpose behind "avoid owning" is unspecific; it invokes a vague notion of responsibility. In other words, what is this obligation of ownership that is feared, exactly? It's best to avoid option A and B (and maybe even C) for being too vague and inaccurate.<n><n>It's much more reasonable that whatever one owns would be used and interacted with daily, making it an inevitable part of interactions with spiders. After all, this isn't the home we're talking about, it's the land surrounding the home. By avoiding the shed, perhaps the person in question is afraid that spiders will crawl inside. <n><n>Finally, option D, the mail box, seems to be an outlier. In most cases, the mailbox is outside and is unlikely to be a home to spiders, so it would make little sense to avoid it.<n><n>The final answer is D: mail box<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question using multiple choice answer format.

In particular, this question speaks of mixing paint and turpentene, which is often used as a solvent for paint. Therefore, the purpose of mixing paint and turpenetine is to improve the texture of the paint, not the color.<n><n>Options I, II, and IV are eliminated immediately as they do not mention any changes to the texture. Only options III and V could result in improved paint texture, but only option V explicitly relates that to turpentine.<n><n>Thus, the best answer is V: a smooth paint texture<n><n>Input: Why are lizards cold-blooded?

Because we can read in every textbooks and articles that inflation is not a good thing, as it destroys the value of money by increasing its quantity.<n><n>What could fighting inflation mean? When you remove the quantity of money that causes it, you are fighting its existence. This fight is, therefore, a defender. As a result, the result is deflation. And the inflation fighter is, therefore, deflationalition.

Choices:  A; tired B; sleepy C; wakeful D; exhausted E; none of these<n>Output: Reason : The way we choose this answer is to check the different emotion that the word have. (A); (B); (C); (D); (E):<n><n>Exhausted = DExhausted; Tired = E<n>Sleepy and Wakeful are in different time, so they are not the same.<n>So between (A) and (D), we should choose answer (D), because it is the only one that are close to each other.<n><n>Input: A friend of your friend's friend is the mother of your son. Choices:  (a) motherhood (b) unclehooding (c) motherhording (d) nepotism (e) cousinghood<n>Output: Reason (a) motherhood is the correct because the word motherhood is a word that is used in a sentence.<n><n>(a) motherhood is correct because it's a word that has no sense in a sentence.<n>(b) unclehooding is incorrect because that word is not a word that can come up as an answer in a multiple-choice question.<n>(c) motherhording is incorrect because that word does not exist.<n>(d) nepotism is incorrect because that is the
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The kids had been having fun all day, there was now a what? Choices:  A: wild ride B: need for rest C: a massive bear D: playing marbles E: constructing<n>Output:		reasoning:<n><n>Analyzing the situation, it's clear that the kids are done playing and have grown tired. It would be weird for them to need "rest" (B) during a time when they have an "energy need" (C), so those aren't good options. There is no mention of a "massive bear" (D) to hunt, so it can be eliminated. Neither "playing marbles" (E) nor a "wild ride" (A) really make sense either, because the kids have just finished fun activities and only need to rest afterward.<n><n>The only remaining answer is, "now a need for rest," which is the only option that fits the context of the situation. <n><n>Option "constructing" is the best answer. It meets all the requirements: we know the kids need rest because they have been having fun all day and are now done playing. This is similar to the "wild ride" option, but it fits the context of the question better. Option "construction" emphasizes that the kids are exhausted after having a fun day, whereas option "wild ride" emphasizes that they are ready to start a new activity, so option A is incorrect.<n>Input: The new employees were tired from their long interview day, it was now what? Choices: A: time for a nap B: time for a meeting C: time to party D: a time to dance E: a time to laugh<n>Output: reasoning:We know that the employees are tired because of their long interview day. There are few tasks that are suitable for a tired employee. However, there are many tasks that are suitable for an employee who has had a good rest. The only logical answer must be (B), 'time for a nap'. The employees have a newfound energy and can now devote their attention to their job.<n>Option "time for a nap" (B) is correct because it's the only answer that fits the context of this situation. The employees are tired after a long interview day and are now ready to relax, which means they're ready to take a nap. The other options can be eliminated because "a meeting" (C) cannot be considered an appropriate activity when a person is tired; "dance" (D) is not common word choice when describing a state of sluggishness; and "party" (E) doesn'

Choices:  A: strongwoman B: cake C: regular D: weak E: fragile<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>The first step is to determine the context of the question, which is a medicinal purpose. <n><n>The next step is to focus on the subject matter - laxatives. <n><n>Finally, it is important to identify the goal of the laxative - preventing constipation.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is "regular" (D).<n><n>Input:You want to make something. You choose to produce that thing because you want which of these? Choices:  - A: money B: joy C: a free ride D: time E: a headache<n>Output:Reasonsing:<n><n>Context: the question refers to making something, which signifies a manufacturing or construction process.<n><n>Purpose: the intention is to produce, meaning to make something.<n><n>Goal: The final answer is B "joy". <n><n>The answer cannot be D "time" because this is an activity that takes time. The question's final goal is to produce, which suggests joy, happiness, excitement and other forms of positive emotions. Therefore, the correct answer is B "joying".<n><n>Input: A strong laxative will keep you from going the entire day without any type of food. But it may do what else? Choices:A: make you look strong. B: help you keep your balance. C: help you lose weight. D: keep you out of trouble. B: headache, C: make you look slim. E: none of the above<n>Output:Reasonings:<n><n>Context: The question implies it is taking or consuming a medicine, which would most likely be to address a medical need.<n><n>Purposes: The goal of the question is to determine a secondary or additional impact that would be helpful, if possible.<n><n>Goal 1: The answer cannot be A B or C because these would not be considered to be benefits of consuming a laxative. As per the context, an additional benefit would be positive, not negative, so A or C do not fit.<n><n>Goal2: The answer cannot be D, "keep you out of trouble", because this does not align with the context of the question at all.<n><n>Goal3: Therefore, the correct answer will be goal 3, which is D "keep you out of  trouble."<n><n>Input: You and I had

Choices:  A: necessity B: answers C: inspiration D: love E: fun<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The sentence indicates that people do chat with friends in class for one of the following reasons: to satisfy some innate need, to seek answers to questions, to share personal sentiments, to gain knowledge, or to have fun. The choice does not indicate whether the class or the friends must be present.<n><n>"Necessity" (A) can be eliminated, since the people are not being forced to chat, nor are the friends. <n><n>"Answers" (B) also is not an accurate choice, since it doesn't match the context of the statement.<n><n>"Inspiration" (C) is similar in meaning to "answer," and thus can be eliminated as an option.<n><n>"Love" (D) is another possible choice, but not one that makes sense in this particular scenario.<n><n>"Fun" (E) is the perfect answer then.

She isn't in a heavily populated area.  Where might she live? Choices:  A: food court B: jerusalem C: new york city D: jewish community E: town<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "Jerusalem" (B) is the most specific answer, suggesting that the deli might be found in a heavily populated area in that city.  However, the answer may not be that specific, in which case, options like "Town" (E) are also correct. These options are a more general explanation for the location of the deli and would also be acceptable as answers. Therefore, they are not exclusive to one another.<n><n>Option "New York City" (C) is the most specific option but not the only one. Therefore, it would be incorrect to reject all other answers.<n>Input: Do you love me more than your sister does? Choices:  True A: False B: Yes C: Maybe D: No E: True<n>Output: Reason::<n>The first task is determining the question type.  This is a direct response question, which invokes simple yes or no answers.

Choices:  A: tennessee B: band practice C: orchestra D: violin case E: music store<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The first task is again to understand the context of this questions. Tennessee (A), the home of country music, does not fit. We also know from the given answer choices that a "fiddle" is a stringed instrument. Therefore, an orchestra or band practice does not make sense.<n><n>Now lets take a look at the answer choices that are either very specific or very vague. "Fiddle case" (E) is a narrow answer that immediately disqualifies other choices.<n>"Music store" (D) is also a too broad answer that has no real relation to the context so that excludes this choice as well.<n><n>The only two remaining answers "tens of thousands of fiddle" (C) and "fiddle" (B) are a little too specific. However, they both seem to be too vague and also too specific at the same time. It seems odd to list a violin as a number of fiddle.<n><n>"A place" (A) is most likely used in this sentence as slang. To eliminate that option, one might consider finding a synonym for "place." After some searching, Google gives a good synonym for "place:" "venue." And we can eliminate (A) if all these other things are true:<n><n>* "place" (venue) -> "tense of thousands of violins" (tens of thousands of fiddles)<n>* "fiddle" -> "violin"<n><n>Now the only possible choices are "tens of thousands" (C) or "fiddle" (B). They seem to be an exact match and is the most likely answer to this question.<n><n>

However, some people may consider that question has only two options A: Go out with F, B: Prepare the bike, in this case, their logical answer is the choice A:Go out with F, but it's not exactly what the question asks. There's a way to consider what logical people should regard as the correct answer even if there's more than 2 choices on the question:  The way to do that was in my opinion to think about how many answers are necessary for what question asked. There's 4 answers to the question of going with friends and having Bike Preparement, so the right choice(logically speaking) should fall on the choice that can be done with minimal effort, in this case, prepare your bike.<n><n>I do not have the answer for choosing choice C(answer): prepare your bike.

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can you learn about operations with numbers? Choices:  A: math book B: phonebook C: statistic D: music school E: office<n>Output:		Operations means mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulo, and others that involve performing a certain mathematical action on a set of numbers.<n><n>As the question implies, the answer here is "math book" (A). The purpose of this question is to figure out where one could learn more about operations, not about learning general mathematics or arithmetic skills.<n><n>The "phonebook" (B) is a physical directory of people's names and addresses. Though this answer is technically correct, it doesn't make sense in the context of this question.<n><n>The answer "statistics" (C) is a word that describes data analysis in the form of statistics. But this is not a book per se, and cannot be used to acquire information about operations.<n><n>The answer choice "music school" (D) is a bit of a misnomer. Many music schools teach lessons in statistics. However, this is not strictly about the subject of operations in general.<n><n>Finally the answer is "office" (E). This seems an unlikely choice in the context of the question, but is the closest one and fits the bill.<n>So the final outcome of this question is E: office.<n><n>Input: Can you do math? Choices: A: yes B: no C: I'm so scared D: I don't care<n>Output:The answer is clearly D: I don' t care. What's interesting about this question (the second question) is that the answer choice 'Yes' is a correct answer, but it isn't the most common one. The only reason to answer 'Yes' is if you do not have any clue about what the question really asks, the answer 'No' seems too easy to understand, as much as the answer 'I don't care' is too easy.<n><n>In this simple multiple choice question, the answer "yes" (B) may seem correct in this situation, as the answer seeks to determine if one can do basic math. But that's not the intent of the question.<n><n>The question asks if one can "do math" (D), not basic math, and does not say what type of math. Though the answer "I don't care" (D) is quite tongue in cheek, it is still the most accurate answer.<n><n>Input: Why are you learning about how to solve quadratic

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:james loved the stars.  In the wilderness, they lit up what? Choices:  A: outer space B: night sky C: universe D: orbit E: the ground<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The first choice "outerspace" (A) is inaccurate because it is referring to the celestial bodies beyond Earth's atmosphere. So it doesn't include the "nighttime" sky."<n><n>The second option, "universe" (B), is not only inaccurate but also redundant. There is only one universe, which includes everything within it and is also referred to as the cosmos or the material universe.<n><n>The phrase "the wilderness" (C) refers to a large piece of uncultivated land or areas that haven't been settled. It fits the context of the question because James was camping outdoors, where it is often darker than in cities or towns.<n><n>Option "orbit" (D) is an irrelevant term used to describe celestial bodies that exist in space around another (like planets, for instance). But it wouldn't be common practice to call a nighttime sky a "star orbit". Therefore, it doesn't make sense within the sentence.<n><n>The last option, "the ground", is most accurate. It fits the context and makes sense within the sentence, as James was admiring stars on land (and within the night sky). Therefore, "the ground" would be the most accurate response to the question.<n>

Choices:  A: teach B: cost money C: do work D: be productive E: help people<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The key to discerning the correct answer choice here is to understand context. The description of "many cubicles" indicates a workplace setting, and the task is to "teach" (A) or "do work" (D).<n><n>Option A doesn't make sense because computers are often used to teach. The task doesn't suggest employees are teaching each other, which makes option A less likely.<n><n>Option D is not true because computers don't need to be taught in order to do work. Computers are designed to do specific tasks, which eliminates option D from the list.  <n><n>Option B needs to be disregarded because computers are used for many purposes besides "teaching". For example, computers are also used to browse the internet, create spreadsheets, or even play video games. But the task of "helping people" is exclusive to the use of computers, which confirms option B as incorrect. <n><n>The correct choice is E: help people, because the task indicates that the goal of the computers is to help people. It's common to use computers for things like online classes, productivity tools, entertainment, and communication. It doesn't make sense to use computers for "doing work" or "teaching" when the task is to "help people".<n>### Instruction:Answer the<n><n>![](../../../images/58.jpg)<n><n>### Instruction<n><n>The input and output choices are<n><n>Output:<n>C: 10:00<n>D: 10:25<n>E: 10:40<n>Output:<n>Input: The man walked out on his boat.<n>Output: The man has never been on a boat before.<n><n>### Solution:Answer<n><n>

A star can not be part of Hollywood. A star can not be night sky. A star can not aliens. A star can only be part of a constellation.<n><n>Given that there were 4 rocky planes orbiting the star and 4 gaseus planets, this means its a binary star. Binary stars form part of constellations, and not single star or night sky or Hollywood or aliens.<n>So we can conclude that the correct answer would be Option D: Constellation<n><n>Input: The man with the big feet asked a girl if she wanted to walk home with him Choices:  A. No B. yes C. I don't know<n>Output:Explanatin: the answer is A:No.<n><n>The sentence "The man with the big feet" could be construed to either refer to someone who has big feet or someone who is very old. We can be certain that the man has big feet by referencing to the second condition "a girl asked him if she wanted to walk..." We can also be certain that this is not a situation where the person with the big feet is trying to pick up a girl, because "A girl asked if she wanted to walk with him." so this can't be a pick-up situation."The man with big feet" refers to someone who is older and may not be considered attractive enough to be a potential partner by the girl. Based on the information in the sentence, the answer is "No."<n><n><n>Input: The question is: why we see the sun and not the sun light Choices: A. I do not know B. because the light has a direction<n>Output:Explanaton: the answer is D.We use our eyes to see light from the sun. The sun itself is so far away that it is not noticeable to the naked eye.<n><n>In answer to this question, one might think that "A because the light has a directions," but there are two problems with this statement: Light does not have a direction. Light is not a thing, its an energy that moves through space and in the process, makes everything it touches visible. It does not have a direction of movement, but rather a direction of movement. The light itself has no direction. In order for us to see it, we should use our eyes. We use our eyes to see the light from

Choices:  A: run programs B: play games C: control model D: power down E: reason exists<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>A scientist needs only to turn off or put his computer to sleep to end his day. Thus the best answer to the question is Choice: "control model" (D).<n>Option "run programs" (A) appears logical, but running programs is a typical everyday function that wouldn't require a scientist to turn off or put their computer to sleep.<n><n>"play games" (B) is also unlikely for a scientist, as it would likely interfere with their work.<n>"control model" (D) is a more subtle term that applies to research in the scientific community and can be the logical answer here.<n><n>Finally "power down" (C) and "reason exists" (E) are too obscure and non-scientific to be considered appropriate answers.<n>So the final choice is "D" and correct is D<n>Output: What type of scientist uses 1000 ml containers called Erlenmeyer flasks? Choices:  B: chemist C: biochemist D: microbiologist E: microscopist<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Chemistry, often related to biochemistry, employs Erlenmeyer flask.<n>Therefore the correct answer is C: Biochemist.<n><n>Input: When someone has a disease, what do they refer to as their body's natural defence called? Choices:  C: immune system D: antibodies E: anticoagulants F: vaccines<n>Output:Reasonings:<n><n>Diseases and infections come from outside the body, that is from viruses which are foreign to humans. Since they enter the body by touching or eating food they can be stopped by keeping the body's surface clean. That's why your body can resist and fight the infection and the disease. Antibodies are immunoglobulins, or gamma globulins. They are proteins which are produced by cells in your lymphatic system and blood stream, which help your body fight disease-causing organisms.<n>When someone has an immunodeficiency, diseaease, viruses or other pathogens can pass through the body's normal defences and attacks the body. To avoid this situation, scientists created vaccines. They are substances made from viruses which

It's the best bank, you don't have no better choice  It's not the most well-known bank in the world but also isn't the biggest. It's not one of those financial institutions that goes around telling everyone it's so trustworthy, it's more about staying relevant. It's a company in the united states, it's from america. It's a bank, it's in america. It'd be called a bank and has the name of the city it's in on the bottom. It's the world'S biggest bank. The city in which it's in is known for many things but it's the city with the biggest bank. The name of the city in which it is located is big. It is a bank so there won't be another bank to give it money. One of the ways that it is different from other banks is that it's not a bank. Banks that aren't actually banks would be called brokers. Brokers that aren't actually brokers aren't called banks so they're banks instead of brokers.

Choices: 1: A. change his clothes 2: B. eat a snack 3: C. study the data more carefully 4: D. get new clothes 5: E. teach a class<n>Output: Reason:  The professor's thoughts in the sentence suggest that he's making a decision, probably to prepare for the class he teaches. In other words, he's thinking about what to wear. From these possible answers, "study the data more carefully" (C) and "change his clothes" (A) don't fit the context of the questions.<n><n>Option B, "eat a snack" (G), seems like a possibility, but an outdated one. It would be odd for a professor on a Monday morning to eat a snack right before a class, so that would likely be a mistake.<n>Option D, "get new clothes" (J), could be a possibility, but not a particularly relevant one. It would make more sense if he were getting new clothes to wear on a particular vacation or holiday, with the class taking place later in the month. In general, the professor here doesn't seem like someone who would choose that as a priority.<n>Option C, "study the date more carefully" (E), is an accurate answer, since the professor presumably spends a lot of time studying data for his class.<n>Finally, option A, "change his clothes" is the most accurate since

What might be true of the driver? Choices: 	A: He was a woman. B: She lost her license. C: She was traveling with kids. D: She was drinking. E: She had insurance.<n>Output: She was driving with kids could mean that it was a woman and she was driving while intoxicated (B or D). If she has insurance, then she just received a speeding ticket and there's no reason to say "lost license" (B). A woman could also be losing her license for another reason like a DUI but that's not the context of this passage.<n><n>The passage uses the phrase "traveling with children" (C) to describe a scenario where a woman is driving with young children.<n><n>So the final result is either D: she was drunk or E: she had insurance<n><n>Input: John, who was very sick, was on the bed.

Choices:  A: cinema hall B: mall C: department store D: closet E: shop<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The clothing in the question is assumed to be expensive because it was purchased at a "cinema hall." <n>While "the cinema hall" could mean the auditorium space inside of the theater, it's likely meant simply the theater itself. <n>It's unlikely the clothing was purchased at a "mall," as it would be unusual to find such expensive clothing at a public shopping area like a mall. <n>It'd be equally unlikely to purchase expensive clothing at a "department store" since it's unlikely that any sort of department store would be so expensive as to warrant the inclusion of such clothing.<n><n>The choice between "closet" and "shop" is based on the context of the question, which invokes the idea of expensive clothing being purchased in an unusual place such as a "cinema hall," so the most probable place where the clothing was purchased is the "shop." "Closet" is not a store, so the most appropriate answer would be "shop."<n><n>So the final answer would be B: shop<n><n>Input:Which would be the most appropriate response to that statement? Choices: 1 Diana is planning to eat some of her cake tomorrow. A: Why don’t you put it away? B: There is no time today. C: I don’t care. D: You are still overeating. E: There is no way there is that much cake.<n>Output:Reasoning:<n>The statement in question is "Diana is planning to eat her cake tomorrow.” It implies that Diana currently has some cake, although it's not specified how much. The options can be divided into four groups based on their relevance:<n><n>(A) "Put it away,” which is unlikely to be the correct response given that the cake is already in Diana's possession, and she wants to eat what's in her possession, not what she might get before eating what she has.<n><n>(B) is the correct response. Diana is obviously having cake, and has the intention to eat more, which is why the question asks if she will eat it "tomorrow."<n><n>(C) "I don't care" would be an appropriate statement for someone who doesn't care if Diana eats, but it's not

Choices:  A: determination B: upper hand C: superior D: higher position E: skill<n>Output:		Reason:It can't be "A: determination".<n>This option is vague and doesn't provide enough information as to why analyzing laboratory data would lead to a "headache". The options "upper hand" (B) and A: "higher position" (E) are eliminated because they suggest the outcome is about ranking higher among competitors, whereas the option of  A: "learn more about" only indicates deeper understanding and not necessarily ranking higher relative to other competitors. Reason:It can’t be A: “headache” because we don't know that the scientist was experiencing a headache due to analyzing the data.<n>The option "bothered" (D), while true in the sense that data analysis can be challenging, is not a logical inference for why the scientist would have a headache. Similarly, the option of "better understanding" is true as well, but also doesn't imply causing a headache.<n><n><n>### Input:<n>Reaching advantage position in competition puts me in what position? Choices: A: determination B higher hand C: superior D position: E: skill<n>Output : Reason : ANSWER : E:  Skill:  In the given passage, the options don’t provide enough information as why analyzing laboratory results would lead to a headache. The options "bothered" D) and "higher hand" (B), while true in the scientific sense, are not logically inferential reasons for why the scientist had a headache due to data analysis.  The option "frankness" (C) and A: "learn more" (A), are only applicable insofar as deeper understanding in the sense that it would lead to "frankness," but it does not necessarily imply a headache. Finally, the option B "better understanding" would be the most applicable answer to the question as it fits the context and goal of analyzing data; which is to understand it better. <n><n># Test for Submission:<n>### Problem I<n>Reason:The first task is to identify the context behind the question.

Choices:  A: strength B: brain C: potential D: qualification E: competence<n>Output:		Reasoned Answer:<n><n>The first step is to identify the reason for people talking "childishly" to him. The sentence "even though his disability was PHYSICAL" eliminates options E and C. The next step is then to analyze the options left and compare them to the initial statement.<n><n>Option "weakness" (B), while physical, doesn't quite meet the criterion - it doesn't involve any disability of the muscle or bones, which is what the sentence is referring to. <n><n>"Potential" (D), while not quite a disability, is also not relevant given the context of the question posed.<n><n>The remaining three choices all contain some form of mental weakness. But option "brain" (A) doesn't quite hit the mark - a "weak" brain would be incapable of logical analysis, meaning someone with a "weak" brain wouldn't necessarily be perceived as a child. Instead, it should be "competence" (E).<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is "competence"<n>

The person clearly is not happy with the scenario and is shouting for help. And if an angry person is shouting on the street, then that is a crime. They might jail the shouting person but will not board a ship.<n>Option B does not make any sense at all. The scenario does not fit a picture of a grocery shopper.<n><n>Option C is a possibility as it fits the situation. But in all probability crossing the street is only a means to an end of going somewhere else, that is, heading to the house.<n><n>Option D is incorrect. The person is not feeling happy as evident from their actions. They are shouting. And shouting is not a happy activity.<n>Option 'E' is incorrect. Even it may be possible that a person shouts but happy. In this situation the person is not satisfied and is also shouting. The scenario doesn’t show a happy person.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I wanted to store my chess pawn when I wasn't using it, what would be a good place for that? Choices:  A: chess set B: strategy C: toy store D: chess game E: small case<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>So, this would be the simplest answer, if you don't have a "chess set" or a "small case" then you can store your chess pawn "in toy store". or you can say in general terms if you have a pawn with you and you don't have "toy store" then you can put it in your "toy bag". You can even say it to your friend "hey man, put your chess pawn in your toy bag in case you don't have any chess set or small case" to your friend.<n><n>Input:The answer is either A. 1, -3, -1 OR B. 6 & 1<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>In case of B, 1 and the value of the square is -1 and 6 and also value of the square is 1. It doesn't make any sense as the answer is -3 i.e. 7-3= -4<n>In the case of A, 1,6, and -1 are the right values of the given square.<n>So the answer is A. 1, 6, -1<n>Input: I want to buy a car. The car dealer wants me to buy a car for $20,000. I have $15,000 and offer to pay $15,050. How many extra cars can I buy compared to if I had only $14,999? Choices: 1: 2 extra cars 2: 1 extra car 3: 0 extra cars 4: -1 extra car 5: -2 extra cars 6: an infinite number of extra cars<n>Output:Reason<n><n>Consider a case where the value of 1 car is 5000 dollars and the value of 1 dollar is 20.<n><n>So if the 1 extra car is 50 dollars then the total value is 20 x 50 i.e. 1000<n><n>and if $2000 then the total value is $20,050 - $50 = $19,950<n>Here the total value is same in both the cases and we don't buy one more car.<n>So 5 is the correct answer<n>Input: At a

Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The correct answer here is choice E: 'fish school'.<n><n>To gain clarity about how "fish school" fits the question, we begin by discarding the other choice and identifying why they cannot be the correct answer.<n><n>First, we notice that the 'fish don't sit' part of the question excludes choice A, "pets." Fish do not sit to complete an inward-turned task such as petting. They swim in an outward fashion.<n><n>Secondly, choice C, "attempt to fly," is discarded because they cannot attempt to fly - a task that would require them to be in the air, as opposed to schooling.<n><n>The next section involves further narrowing down our remaining choice, "school together."<n><n>Fish schools together to breathe air.<n><n>The reason choice E, "fish school" answers the question is because fish school to help breath air. <n><n>With this, the remaining choice, "schooling together" is the correct answer to this question.<n><n>

Choices:  A: war B: aircraft carrier C: sky D: graveyard E: crash<n>Output:		Reason: This question is not clear, but there are a lot of hints to help you decipher the answer. First, you consider the context of the prompt, which mentions an aircraft carrier and war as potential locations where you might find airplanes. You conclude that the airplanes wouldn't be used in either of those settings - either if they're on an aircraft carrier, they would be flying, which doesn't necessarily indicate "not in use," or if they're being used in a war, they wouldn't be flying. <n><n>Next, you consider the meaning of "airplanes that are not used," which is what this question is asking you to find. While the prompt doesn't explicitly state what "not used" means, looking at the broader context and what you've already discussed, it's clear that this question is asking you about non-flying airplanes. <n><n>Finally, you think about what types of airplanes you might find around the airport. You consider an airport's maintenance and storage buildings, which are where airplanes are typically kept and repaired. You conclude that you could find airplanes stored or being repaired in these locations. <n><n>So the answer is C: sky<n><n>Input:A person is always in front of you. Choices:  A.

Choices: A: electricity B: transmission system C: airbrake D: engine E: manual transmission<n>Output:Reasoning: The first thing to take away from this question is the mention of a car being a "two wheeled vehicle," which automatically eliminates option A (electricity).<n><n>The options which remain (B, C, and D) all revolve around vehicles, and thus can be eliminated.<n><n>The answer to this question can be found by breaking down the words associated with <n>"car."

Choices:  A: wooded area B: body of water C: the ocean D: british columbia E: zoo<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The question asks the reader, "Where does a beaver do [leave]?" based on the title of the passage,"The Beaver Saga". In other words, it's asking where the beaver goes after the events of the story.<n><n>Option "wooded area" (B), is an interesting selection as it refers to the "forest area" where the beaver lives initially. It is certainly a place the beaver does leave after fleeing the cabin in the opening scene.<n><n>However "the ocean" (D) doesn't make much sense since the beaver never left the lake area (according to the passage) and "zoo" (E), even though the beaver does eventually end up at the zoo, would be a less obvious choice for the next location.<n><n>The correct answer is therefore B: "wooded area".<n><n>input: What would be an appropriate response to the question, "I don't know any more than that"?

Choices:  A: watch film B: play cards C: play chess D: read news papers E: surf net<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First, understand the context. It is stated that the speaker of the question is "experiencing" boredom.<n><n>Second, understand the options. The options are limited to a number of actions that the speaker is describing he does.<n><n>From this, we understand that the option "surf net" (E) cannot be correct, because the questioner is referring to actions that he/she takes based on the feeling of boredom, which suggests that net surfing has been the case. So the options are A-C, which involves entertaining activities such as movies, cards, and chess - all of which are physical actions, as opposed to internet surfing, which is a sedentary activity.<n><n>Finally the correct answer is option B: watch films. As such, movies is the only physical action among the options that is involved in the act of watching television, hence it is the most appropriate answer.<n>

If they understand each other, they can do what? Choices:  A: pay bills B: swap bodies C: learn from each other D: believe in god E: talk to each other<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Notice that all answers except the one that begins with "can" are not possible as a logical continuation of the sentence. <n><n>Starting with the sentence's end, "learn from each other" (C) is logically impossible.  Although humans do learn from one another in real life, it would not be possible to learn simply by listening to others; there must be some kind of interaction before learning can occur.  Therefore, this answer can be eliminated.<n><n>Next, focus on the middle option: "can pay bills." The first half of the sentence implies that people can understand each other better through listening.   However, paying bills cannot directly result from mutual understanding - not only would a large number of transactions be required for that purpose, but this kind of payment is also unlikely ever to happen out of mutual respect rather than a contractual agreement.  Therefore, this can be eliminated, leaving two options for the end of the sentence: "believe in god" (D), and "talk to each other" (E).<n><n>Option (D), "believe in god," is not a plausible end to the sentence. People may believe in god, or they may listen and understand each other, but they would not actually "do" this action simultaneously.  Further, although it is true that religious beliefs can be born out of mutual respect and discussion, the discussion would never result in "believing in god," even if there is mutual understanding, simply because it would not be the same thing.<n><n>Finally "can talk to each other" (D). The sentence could continue, "If they can understand each other, then they can talk to each other and can do what?"  The sentence does not indicate that more than one action is required.  Therefore the final answer is E.<n>Output: Input: There is nothing more beautiful than freedom. If you are free, you can do what? Choice: A) make choices B) talk to people C) create problems D) help others E) think of god<n><n>Output:<n><n>Notice several facts about the sentence:<n><n>* It does not begin "If people can understand each other, they  can" <n>* The sentence as a whole states that freedom is beautiful and that people who are free can go on to do anything. So the "you" being talked about is free, and it

Choices:  A: redemption B: isolation C: absolution D: great relief E: feel better<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question makes clear references to feeling and emotions. Therefore a good answer will also connect how an attitude of forgiveness relates to these emotions and how they are experienced, for instance to feel better (E).<n><n>Option "A: redemption" (A) could be correct if the person asking forgiveness were being transformed by their sins. However, the attitude of the person giving the forgiveness and whether the person asking forgiveness is truly repentant are not addressed.<n><n>Option "B: isolation" (B) is incorrect because the question does not make it clear whether the person asking for forgiveness is asking to be isolated - therefore this option is incorrect because it relates to an experience that the person is asking to be forgiven for.<n><n>Option "C: absolution" (C) is incorrect because it is an incorrect term to use to describe forgiveness. Absolution refers to being absolved of a past sin.<n><n>Option "D: great relief" (D) is incorrect because the person isn't necessarily feeling great - they might in fact be feeling regret or shame.<n><n>"E: feels better" (E) is a grammatically inaccurate way to phrase this answer, as the question is not specifically asking about the feelings of the person who is being forgiven, rather than the one who is forgiving.<n><n>Therefore, the best answer is option E: feels better<n><n>Input:The company is thinking of changing the way it designs its product, how do they plan to do so?

C. they will be doing nothing to improve on their product if they are not going to change how they design their products. D. doing so, they will have a different mindset. E. they are not going to do so, they believe that they are doing what they believe.<n>Output: Reasoned answer:<n><n>Option "A" (A) is incorrect because they are not thinking of changing the way they design their product, they are considering doing this due to wanting to expand their business and increase revenue. The company is not planning to change the way they design their products and instead wants to improve the product.<n><n>Option "E" (E) is incorrect because a different

He picked a place that was inexpensive and offered few luxuries.  Where might he be staying? Choices:  A: farm B: town C: city D: hotel E: motel<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Options C, D, E are all clearly not accurate. A: farms and towns are not inexpensive and don't offer "few" luxuries. City: cities always offer luxuries, but that doesn't mean they're expensive and have "few" luxeuries. Hotels and motels are definitely "luxuries," but they're not inexpensive. (Hotels cost more per night than motels.) <n><n>In the beginning of the paragraph, it describes that John had a limited budget, with no mention that he had more money to spend than that. It also says that he couldn't find a "place to stay," which isn't true for a farm or a city. If he couldn't find anywhere to stay, it wouldn't say that, as there's nowhere else to go.<n><n>It states that he picked somewhere "inexpensive" and offered "few luxuries." Hotels and motels do have more luxuries than a regular place. The average person doesn't have a million dollars to spend at a hotel each night, which is why many choose motels.<n><n>This means that the answer is E: motel.<n><n>Input:Which of the following does the dog not need to eat? Choices:  a: catfood b: dogfood c: fishdifld: fruit E: vegetables<n>Output: Reason for:<n><n>Option B is the correct answer choice.<n>The word "catfood," as a part of the question, excludes it in the possible correct answer choices.<n>The question uses the word "dogfood" earlier in the paragraph, which means the answer has to include dogfood.<n><n>Option E, fruits, is already mentioned in the paragraph, which would also cause this to be excluded from the answer.<n><n>The most important clue, from the context, is the following:<n><n>I would rather the dog ate catfood than dogfood so it wouldn't be too much to ask for the dog to eat my cat.<n>This implies that the dog does/needs to/has to eat dogfood, which immediately excludes option C, fishdif.<n><n>Answer 2) "does not need to eat" is a must-exclude for the question, as a must-include in the correct answer;

Choices:  A: building B: hallway C: table D: exchange E: office<n>Output:		Reasoning: <n><n>The key to this question is understanding the context of the word "they". If the word "they" is referring to stock sellers, then options B, C, and D are correct because a hallway, table, and exchange are commonly used to refer to these spaces in the trading environment.<n><n>If the word "they" refers to traders, then either "building" (A) or "office" (E) is the correct answer. This is because the traders typically work in a building or an office space when they are not conducting their trades on the floor of the exchange.<n><n>Assuming the word "they" does not refer to the stock sellers, and instead refers to the stock traders themselves, then the best response choices remain "house" (A) and "office" (E).<n>The word "they" is a grammatically incorrect choice and is not a response. Therefore, this question can be eliminated.<n><n>Finally and with the context above, the last response choices of "building" (A), "hallway" (I), and "table" (C) are each incorrect. <n><n>So the final answer would be the only remaining answer choice, the "office" (E), which fits the appropriate context of the word "building" being used to describe both "they" as stock traders and "they" as salesmen.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: read book B: getting bored C: worry D: singing E: s never comes<n>Output:		Reason:It's always better to focus on the positive as oppose the negative. While the other answers could be partially correct, they are more negative than this one by focusing on the waiting time. Therefore, the most effective way to deal with the situation is to just spend the time productively, thus this would be the most positive solution.<n><n>Input:A bicyclist is a person who uses a bicycle to travel.

Choices:  Yes, it's impossible to lose data No, never Yes, sometimes No, he might lose it when there are technical problems<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>"Always lose" is not a reasonable answer. It is possible that a scientist can lose data, but it doesn't mean that he will always lose the data in the future. The phrase "he might lose it" would be the possible explanation, therefore, it will be the right answer.<n><n>Input:If there is a problem, what will the scientists do? Choices:  Make it correct Ask for more advice from other people Get the help of a technician <n>Output:Reason::<n><n>The answer must be "Make it correct" if a scientist is not sure what to do in a problematic situation. If a problem is too technical and a scientist needs to consult with an expert, he will ask for their help, not try to fix it himself. In this situation, the scientist has enough knowledge to fix the problem on his own so a question related to asking for help is incorrect.<n><n>Input:There is an earthworm that is being taken care of. Choices:  It's going to die It's going to live It's dead It's sick and dying<n>Output:ReasonThe context of this scenario implies a live and healthy earthworm, rather than a sick one! Also, there are many things that a homeowner might do which do not involve giving water. There are many choices which are invalid, but a possible answer could be "It's dead". That is, the earthworm is being taken care of but already dead.<n><n>Input:How many apples do you have? Cho

Choices:  A: satisfied B: unnecessary C: luxury D: sufficient E: extra<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>"Sufficient", as in "not the same as necessary or required", is one possible definition of "sufficient", but not one that fits in this scenario.<n>"Luxury" is also an option, wherein an item might be described as something you can do without, but does not mean you don't "need it" in the sense of "required".<n><n>That leaves three options: <n><n>-  "extra" - means you can avoid it, but you could have it if you want to. <n>-  "unnecessary" - means you can do without it. <n>-   not just "something", but "something specific", "something specific" can be avoided if it's just "something" which means it's not needed but can get along with it if it's necessary.<n><n>So the final answer would be "unnecessary".<n><n>Input: Where does one typically find a dime? Choices: <n> A: grocery store B: piggy bank C: pizza box D: trash can E: library<n>Output: Reason <n>The options don't even have any logical answers, if we go with the piggy bank, how a piggy bank has the ability of "throwing" or "eating"?. <n><n>Input: What could a person call their best friend?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where could you find an armchair that is used by only a few people? Choices:  A: doctor's office B: hospital C: apartment D: study E: furniture store<n>Output:		Reason:The first task is to look for clues as to what an "armchair" is, i.e., what specifically is being referred to. The context points to a hospital, so it would be implausible to find an "armchair." But since a "study" can be used as an intimidating term for a hospital ward, this option could also be accepted as plausible. The idea of a private study is not very credible, however, which removes this option from consideration. The last option, "apartment," also seems to be a strange choice, since there would be very few apartments in a hospital.<n><n>The next task, then, is to try and determine where the furniture associated with an "armchair," would be found. Again, the context is pointing in the direction of a hospital. The "furniture store" provides further insight into the idea that the furniture would be used by only a few users and is therefore an implausible option since it would have many customers. <n><n>Similarly, "doctor's office" is another implausible option, since there would also be many customers seeking medical attention at the doctor's office. The only valid option left, then, is the "hospital." So the final answer is D: hospital

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E).

"Soda pop" refers to either a bottle or can of soda, while "candy bar" obviously cannot be held with either. This eliminates C and D. "Coffee" is both liquid and solid, so while most individuals would likely pour it themselves into a container, it can easily be handled in a container. This eliminates B. Finally, a "cupboard" is an entirely different entity from an individual item, so it is certainly not classified as an item that fits in an individual's hand. The same can be said of A.<n>So the final option is E: Soda pop<n><n>Input:What does a doctor say before taking a vaccination? Choices:  B: 1234567890 A: Soup, I'm a fish!

The option does not seem to make any sense, especially when you realize that a vaccination is not being taken orally. Therefore, options B, C, and D are eliminated. From here, we examine option E, which doesn't make much logical sense due to the ambiguity of what word should be substituted. Option E suggests that the vaccination is causing a lot of pain and discomfort, so it's hard to envision a case in which a doctor would utter this phrase before administering the vaccination. This leaves us with option E.<n>So the final answers are: E) Hurts<n><n>Comment: I think you copied this from quora or chegg<n><n>Comment: I believe chegg.com might be a better site for posting all these answeres.<n><n>Comment: i have found the answers in internet and its not all mine
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:A student wants to hear what the professor is saying, what does he do? Choices:  A: gain experience B: taking notes C: listen carefully D: complete test E: focus<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to understand the context and purpose behind the student's actions.<n>The scenario implies that the student is listening to a lecture or lesson. The purpose of the lecture is likely to gain information or knowledge, which means the student should be "listening carefully" (B).<n>Similarly, taking notes (B) would be unnecessary.<n>Another option is for the student to "gain experience" (A). However, this fits the context of completing assignments and projects rather than listening to lectures, and is therefore irrelevant to the question.<n><n>Finally we evaluate each option again, and can discount "complete test" (E) as it's not related to listening to the lecture. This leaves us with only two options: listening carefully (B) and listening to the lecture (D).<n><n>In this situation, it is essential for the student to fully understand the material that is presented in the lecture. Listening to the lecture carefully, thus "listening carefully" is the best option.<n>So the final choice is B: Listening carefully<n><n>Input:A patient complained of tingling in one leg and went to a doctor. To figure out what the problem is, what would the doctor do first? Choices: A: ask for the patient's name B: find more info C: examine details D: study the symptoms E: review the details<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>To begin, it is essential to understand the context and scenario of the patient's visit to the doctor. The scenario gives us some clues about what kind of problem the patient is having, but it does not provide any insight into what exactly the problem might be.<n>The first task is then to narrow down the potential causes of the patient's symptoms. <n>While 'examine details' (C) may help us to rule out certain diagnoses, it does not help us to narrow down our focus to a particular problem.<n>Similarly,'studying the symptoms' (D) does not narrow down our focus either, and may be more effective if we had more information about the symptoms.<n><n>It seems that the best option would be to 'ask for the patient's history' (B). This would help us to narrow down the potential diagnoses and focus our attention on a particular problem that the patient is experiencing.<n>But it doesn'

Choices:  A: antique store B: in the graveyard C: kitchen D: junk yard E: ice<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n>All the options are irrelevant. A broken icebox has no use.<n><n>Instead, if you would like to dispose of a broken ice box, you could throw it in the garbage, recycle it, or take it to a repair shop. These options would all be valid choices for disposing of a broken icebox.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is none of the above.<n><n>Input: How is Taupe spelled: Choices:  A : tape B : tapeo C : tapeo D : tapeo E: Tape<n>Output: Reasonnig:The letter "TU" in "TUNE" spelt backwards is "NUE" but the spelling of "Tape" has no backwards spelling.<n>Tape is spelled tape, regardless of its direction.<n><n>The options "tapeo" (B), "tapeo D" (D), and "Tape" (E) do not fit the context of the question - namely, "how is Taupe spelt". The spelling of Tape cannot be tapeo or tapeo D (or any other variation), because it is simply Tape.<n><n>The options for this question can be narrowed down further by identifying that the spelling rule is not backwards, but forwards. The spelling of TAPEO D, "Tapes" with all the E's spelt backwards, and "Tape" with the A's spelt backwards are invalid for this question.<n><n>The remaining options are incorrect because they do not reference the spelling rule. Option "tapeo" does not say what spelling rule would apply to this word; it merely lists what tape looks like spelt backwards. And option "Tapeo" simply refers to the singular form of tape.<n><n>We're left with one option, "Tape" (without an A). The correct spelling of the word in this case is "Tape", with no backwards spelling applicable here. Therefore, the answer is Tape.<n><n>Input: What type of fish can be found in the ocean?

Choices:  A: grandma B: clothing C: jewelry store D: clothes E: fabric store<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>As usual, we must identify the first clue in this question. The sentence "She wanted to make a" suggests that the answer will begin with "she wanted to make a" as a preposition. Here's an article to learn more about prepositions: https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-are-prepositions-prepositional-phrases-examples.html<n><n>The answer should include "make a...". Therefore, we should choose the option that has "make a" as part of the beginning of the sentence.<n><n>The option with "granma" (A) doesn't use the phrase "make a" anywhere.<n><n>The option "clothing" (B) doesn't have "a" as a preposition before "clothing" - "clothing" is the beginning of the sentence itself.<n><n>The option includes "shop" (D), but the preposition is already provided in "make a" so it doesn't fit the given sentence.<n><n>The final option is "make a quilt of velvets" (E). Here are some examples of prepositional phrases that we can create to use as evidence:<n>```<n>"He is going to the store to get the books."<n>"She found the dog in the house."<n>```<n><n>The given option uses every preposition that we need to use. Because this option follows our requirements, "A:... of velvet" is the only choice we can come up with as a potential answer for this question. This means option E is the answer.<n><n>Input: He was looking at the map and realized it contained information on the country of  where? Choices: 	A: Afghanistan B: Israel C: Kuwait D: Lebanon E: Iran<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The sentence "he was looking at the map" means he was looking at the map, and he realized what? To answer this question, look for keywords that give clues as to what information the map may contain. In the sentence, he was looking at the "map" and not "continent" or "city". Because geography is generally associated with maps, this implies that the map most likely contains information on a country.<n><n>The answer must begin with "it contains information" or "that contains information". Because there are a good deal of countries that contain

Choices:  A: chicken coop B: supermarket C: box D: egg carton E: henhouse<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>As you can see, the question is about holding eggs, not chickens. There are a couple ways to understand this question. If it is referring to the plural form of eggs, the answer is "egg carton" (D). However, this is a word play intended to trick you into choosing the wrong answer. Since plural in English refers to anything multiple or in excess, it's a better idea to choose the correct form of the word "egg." In this case, the question is referring to holding just one egg. Therefore, the answer is "henhouse" (E), as it's the place where the hen lives and lays its eggs.<n><n>Input:I have an account with a bank which was used to pay 84% of my bills. 58% of the bills remained at or under $100. What is the total number of bills that I had when using my bank account to pay my bills?  Choices:  A:$100 B:$84 C:$1000 D:$800 E: $580<n>Output: Reasonable inference:<n><n>The question asks us to find the total number of bils. We simply know by the last sentence, "The rest are under $100" that 42% are under $10, so we can use the fact that 84% are paid using the bank account to conclude that 42%-12%=30% are paid with the bank account.<n><n>Input: Which is the most closely related to this statement, if any?

This means it is somewhere it shouldn't be, and has been separated from its owner. The most likely place to find such a dog would be in its owner's home. An alternative option could be the New Hampshire, however, this doesn't make logical sense on its own.<n><n>Input:The fastest man ever recorded had what shoe size?

Choices:  A: detroit B: australia C: michigan park D: cafe E: retail store<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question clearly states that they want to buy the sauces, which indicates that the store options are all valid choices. <n><n>Option "detroit" (A) is clearly a nonsense city. The term "new barbecue sauces" suggests that the sauces are not yet on the market. Therefore, the only way to acquire new sauces is by buying them.<n><n>Option "retail store" (B) is unlikely, because the word "retail" is associated with the sale of goods. This suggests that the store would probably have some pre-existing sauces, as they are not yet new.<n><n>Option "Australia" (C) is also not a valid choice, because there is no reason to assume that the store is located in Australia.<n><n>Option "Michegan Park" (D) is also very vague. The choice of location should be made in accordance with where one is most likely to find the specific kind of sauces they're looking for.<n><n>The only remaining choice is "Cafe" (E). Here, the context of the question is to buy some sauces; therefore, it wouldn't be too strange to buy them there. And it is reasonable to assume that they serve some type of food there that may have barbecue sauces offered for sale.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: Cafe<n><n>Input:If I wanted to look for a dog for the winter, where would I get one?

Choices:  A: lake B: aquariums C: swimming pool D: pond E: childrens pools<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option (C) is eliminated because the question is referring to swimming pools which normally would not be shallow water (if it were shallow water it would not be a swimming pool). Therefore, this rules out ponds and children's pools.<n><n>Option (A) lakes are generally larger than standard swimming pools. When the question refers to shallow waters they are generally referring to places like rivers. Therefore this option is immediately eliminated.<n><n>Option (D) ponds have the potential to be shallow water and shallow water can be classified as a portion of bodies of water. Therefore, these two options are eliminated. Because option (B) states that it is a swimming pool and ponds may not be considered large swimming pools in some cases, this leaves as the best possible answer.<n>

Choices:  A: public building B: tomb C: arena D: large building E: treasure<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>The first step is to determine exactly what context this question is asking for. In the previous question, the option "A: a large building" (C) would be perfectly valid. However, there's an important key to find when looking at the question: "buried" in the first sentence immediately eliminates "A: a large public building" and "D: arena".<n><n>We can now move on to deciphering and understanding the purpose of the explorers' actions.<n>"buried" suggests treasure, but not necessarily "a large public building" or "arena". The second relevant word to consider is "straight". This is a significant piece of insight regarding the context: since the answers are to be chosen from "A: public building", "B: tomb", "C: arena", "D: large building", and "E: treasure", a large public building or even an arena might be considered valid. But the word "straight" immediately eliminates answers which are not "large public buildings" or "arenas", therefore limiting the pool to "B: tomb", and "C: arena" choices.<n><n>Since "A: public building" (as shown from the previously eliminated choices) is obviously not a legitimate answer, that leaves us with three choices, one of which is "E: treasure". That makes "D: large building" (the only remaining answer with "straight") the correct answer, since it is "the ancient buried tombs" (A).<n><n>So the final answer to the question is D: large building<n>

Choices:  A: relax B: controversy C: pleasure D: frustration E: needs theater<n>Output:		Answer: Reasoning: The options A and D do not fit because creating art requires hard work and dedication. Options B and E are not really about creating art; rather they are needed to be a good artist, but they are not part of the process of creative work. So the final answer is C.<n><n>Input:The lab results had been compiled and analyzed for better understanding. Choices: A: true B: false<n>Output: Answer: Answer:Reasoning: In this context, the statement is true.<n>The scientist is analyzing the data to learn more about it, not to learn how to use it. Therefore, the statement "A: learn more about" is incorrect.<n>The statement "enlightenment," although it is true, does not apply because the scientist is not trying to enlighten himself or others.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is B.<n><n>Input: Which of the following helps a person determine if they are good at math? Choices: A: enjoying it B: asking teachers and friends C: understanding it D: trying to get good at it E: all of the answers<n>Output: Answer:Reason: "The answer is B: asking teachers and frieds." There are two problems with "enjoying it", the first being that it's a matter of preference (i.e, if one doesn't like math, they wouldn't enjoy it). Second, if one doesn'tknow a subject very well, they might enjoy it, but not be able to do much. That being said, "asking teachers and friends" is the best answer because it's objective. <n><n>Input: The scientist decided to relax and take a break after analyzing the lab results. Choices: A. learn more about B. enlightenment C. do math D. headache E. better understanding. Output: Answer Reasoning: The scientist did not decide to take a break to do math, which is why the answer is not "do math." He also did not decide to take rest because he found a "headache." Because the answer is not "learn more about," which is irrelevant, the only choice that fits is  "enlightenment." The answer is not C. However it is not D either, since it is not taking more time to understand the results better, so the only answer that fits well is E.<n>

Choices:  A: walmart B: loft C: house D: home depot E: kitchen<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In the context of the question, the character is "looking for" (where) indicates that he is hunting for flooring.<n><n>Option "loft" (B) is unlikely to the character's intention because the word "hunt" in the question already states that he does not already have something. This option seems like an inappropriate choice.<n><n>Option "home depot" (D) seems like a possible candidate. "Home" is part of the character's quest, but so is "floor". However, "where" in the question also suggests that the character is in search of a place to buy. Therefore, this option seems like to be a likely fit.<n><n>Finally option "kitchen" (E) seems too specific. "Where" in the question provides more context than that kitchen, for instance. Therefore this option seems too specific for the character's quest to find a place to buy flooring.<n><n>The correct option is therefore "home depot"<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n>Input: A man was late for his flight, where was A man looking?

Choices:  A: smell smoke B: catch cold C: burnt D: look angry E: bank savings<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question focuses on a specific event: the person cooking a pizza in the oven. As such, the options should all relate to the activity of cooking the pizza. <n><n>Option "look angry" (D) doesn't belong, because it doesn't mention any activity related to the cooking process. This option should be eliminated.<n><n>Option "burnt" (C) and "bank savings" (E) do not fit the context of the question, so both should be disregarded.<n><n>Now, let's consider option "catch cold" (B). It suggests an adverse outcome in relation to the process of cooking. This seems plausible, especially since the question mentions a "pizza" as a specific object that was cooked. However, other objects might have also been in the oven, such as fruits, pastries, or even people. Therefore, this option should be disregarded as well.<n><n>Finally option "smells smoke" (A) remains. While not exactly a common description of cooking food, a possibility exists that smoke was detected, and the outcome was a fire. Given the option's specificity, it is the most likely outcome, therefore the answer is A: Smells smoke<n><n>Input:Who is the richest footballer? 2018<n>Input:The most beautiful female tennis player in the world 2012<n>Input:Who was the best player of the NBA in 1986?<n>Output:In this problem we are required to find the richest footballer 2018, best player of the NBA 1986, best female player in the world 1986 on Wikipedia.<n><n>Output:<n>## 2018 FIFA World Cup<n>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Final<n><n>The Best Player Award recognizes the most outstanding player in the FIFA World Cup.

Choices:  A: plain B: cold C: dull D: bad E: wet<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To answer this question, we first need to understand the scenario: The clouds are described as being "above" the speaker, hinting that there is already an observer present who noticed the clouds. <n><n>Option "plain" (A) doesn't make sense, since clouds are clearly an eye-catching phenomenon that would be sure to grab attention.<n>As for option "dull" (C), that can't be possible, as clouds are generally recognized as being bright and eye-catching.<n><n>That leaves us with the other options: "bad" (D) and "wet" (E). These are both plausible possibilities, as they would both potentially affect the observer who's viewing the clouds.<n><n>The choice of "wet" (option E) seems more plausible than "bad" (option D) because most people would interpret precipitation (ie: rain, snow) as being bad rather than wet, and "bad" itself isn't specific enough. The option "bad" could mean anything.<n><n>Therefore, based on the given information, the most accurate answer is option E: wet<n><n>Input: What is the most common thing that you hear people say when you are in a classroom?

From the context, we understand that we're probably in a school or university, and we're probably talking about a lecture/classroom. So we can rule out "Chairs" (option B).<n><n>Since the teacher is not present, we can then eliminate "Teacher" (option D) and "Door" (option A).<n><n>While "Students" (option C) is a common activity in a classroom, its not the most common thing a student might hear in class. Instead, the most common thing you might hear is the teacher being asked a question by a student, or the student responding to something the teacher said.<n><n>Therefore the correct answer is "Students"<n><n>Input: Why did the man go to his friend’s party without telling him?

Choices:  A: pet shops B: new mexico C: white house D: arctic E: garden of eden<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here "pet shops" and "new mexico" seem very unlikely as options, so we need to eliminate those two. Then, we should look for a context - when a snake would be in a pet shops or New Mexico. When we look at the last option, "Garden of Eden" we can see that it is unlikely that there is a Garden of Eden. Therefore the answer would be "arctic" as it is the only obvious option.<n><n>Input:What did Santa's reindeer name their calf?

Choices:  A: jewelry store B: neck C: jewlery box D: jewelry box E: boutique<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The first thing to do is to identify the prepositional phrase containing the target word. The underlined words "choker" and "boutique" both contain prepositional phrases.<n><n>The second step is to deduce which modifier "which" or "who" is referring to by reading the sentence as a whole.<n><n>It's clear that the scientist is looking for a "choker not located in a boutique" in the first sentence, so we can immediately eliminate options B and E, which are referring to different locations of the choker. <n><n>Next, we need to determine whether the target word "located" is an adverb or a preposition. To understand whether a word is an adverb or preposition, we look at the subject of the sentence to determine if it is in the same phrase.<n><n>In this case, it is clear from subject 'jewelry box' that "located" is an example of a preposition. (Prepositions are formed between the subject and the predicate, while adverbs are not.)<n><n>The question then becomes, "where would you go to find the choker?"<n><n>It makes the most sense if the answer option "jewelry store" is chosen. This is because a jewelry store is the location of a "jewelry boutique." This is supported by the context of the question: "You are looking for a choker not located [in a jewelry boutique]."<n><n>Therefore, we can confidently conclude that the correct answer choice is "jewelry shop".<n><n>Input: "Learning is a lifelong endeavor.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The only baggage the woman checked was a drawstring bag, where was she heading with it? Choices:  A: garbage can B: military C: jewelry store D: safe E: airport<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer is "E: airport". The question implies that the woman's bag is being checked into luggage, indicating that she is heading towards the airport. It is unlikely that the airport would have a garbage can or jewelry store, making B and C irrelevant.<n>Moreover, the answer D is unlikely since the phrase "safe container" suggests an alternative to garbage bags or drawstring bags might be used, such as a lockable box or a safe.<n>Finally, option A is also unlikely since such a bag would typically not be checked into luggage. The only answer that fits the question's context is E: airport<n>Final Answer is E<n><n>Input: The students will be working on the puzzle for the remainder of the evening, even if they haven't figured anything out yet. But before that happened, what does the teacher plan on doing? Choices: 	 A: get more sleep B: go to bed C: take a nap D: get some answers to their questions E: sleep more<n>Output: The answer is E. Explanation: "Get some answers to their questions" is the only answer choice that makes sense. The teacher will answer their questions before going to bed. It's possible that they might get more answers at night, but that isn't the only thing they need to do. The remaining choices are all irrelevant in this context.<n><n>Input: Why did the cowboy ride off in such a hurry? Choices: <n>	 A: because he was an old Indian<n>	 B: because he had a broken leg<n>	 C: because he was riding in a wagon<n>	 D: because he was angry<n>	 E: because he wanted to go home<n>Output:<n>The correct answer is D because, the cowboy was in such a hurry because he was angry. Only the choices that explain why the cowboy was angry would fit the question. It is unlikely that he rode the horse home since he only rode the horse to get from one place to another. The only way that he was an old Indian was that he was angry.<n><n><n>Input:Which country is the world's #1 consumer of bananas?

Choices:  A: mouth B: grocery cart C: super market D: fruit basket E: fruit market<n>Output:		Reason:<n>   <n>In the supermarkets, there is a place to place grapes on shopping carts which is called 'grape basket' and the check-out counter is right next to it. However, in supermarkets such a fruit market, fruit basket is a place where grapes are put by the check-out counter, and the grocery carts are in the front where the grapes are placed when going through the check out process.<n>   <n>Also, grapes are always eaten by mouth, so the answer must be C.<n>So the answer to the question is C<n>### Instruction: Answer the following question.<n><n>What did the professor tell the students on the last day of math class?

Choices:  A: yard B: basement C: kitchen D: living room E: garden<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to do is try out an educated guess to determine if this is a question with only one correct answer (it kind of seems so). If not, there are several other questions that could have the same answer or a different answer. If there is at least one right answer, then move onto the next step.<n><n>Second, try to figure out what the options are being compared to. In this case, based off of the name of the room, its name is the “yard” with the option names following "yard" after it. Thus: of all the rooms in a yard, it is my favorite.<n><n>With that narrowed down, the next step is to try to answer the question. First, based on the context, it is clear that the yard is a house yard. The yard is also my favorite because the only other option that is relevant is “yard”, and it is clear what the option is being compared to. Thus… of all the gardens that a house yard has, it is my favorite (“yard” is the correct answer).<n><n>So the final answer "yard"<n><n>### Instruction: Choose either the best or most likely to be right! <n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>So the reason which we choose the answer as the most likely because it should be true.<n>### Instruction Choose either the best <n><n>Output:Reason<n>The final answer will be B<n><n>Instruction: Choose the answer that most closely matches your experience. <n><n>Output: A<n>The first thing to notice is that this question has a lot of incorrect answers.

Choices:  A: one material often recycled B: ripped C: saturated with water D: one dimensional E: crumpled<n>Output:		Reason:<n> <n>A paper can be recycled if it does not move and is left outside.<n>One material that is commonly recycled is paper. If a paper is left outside, it can undergo the recycling process. That means that option B, which involves recycling, is the most likely outcome.<n><n>Option C, which involves saturating with water, indicates that the paper may be used for something less permanent than recycling. An item that is saturated with water may not be made into paper again, or may not be considered "recycled."<n><n>Option D, which involves one-dimensionality, may also occur if the paper is left outside for prolonged periods. It refers to changes in the paper's shape, implying that it will become damaged and not functional.<n><n>Option E, crumpling, is not necessarily affected by leaving the paper outside. It usually takes time for the crumpling to occur, as the paper is manipulated and folded. The paper is more likely to be recycled, rather than crumpled, if left outside.<n><n>So the final answer should be A: one material often Recycled <n><n>Input:What can be the weight of an object?

A person who is enjoying themselves is not typically stressed or illegal. Therefore, the option that fits the context of the question is (C).<n><n>Finally, it gets a little tricker to answer the third question: whether the person is deadly. If he is indeed deadly, the last question would be moot - it would be asking whether the person is dead or alive. The person is obviously alive by the time of the interview, as he is being interviewed.<n><n>So option (E) is the correct answer to this question.<n><n>Input:"A" B: "B" C: "C" D: "D" E: "E" Output: Reason:<n>Input: A: What kind of drink is green and contains two cups of sugar? Choices:  "A" B: "Red" C: "Blue" D: "Black" E: "Black coffee"<n>Output: Reason & Answer:<n><n>The questions are ordered in a particular way, the answers for the first question (A) are B and C and the answers for the second question (B) are D and E and so on.<n><n>In order to answer, we can first eliminate B and C.<n>The only answer that doesn't start with B or C is D, which clearly does NOT contain "2 cups of sugar".<n>Hence, the only answer for the third question (B) is A.<n><n>Since the order is also consistent for the next questions, we can just simply re-order the questions to get the most likely answer, then use the elimination process in reverse on the questions that remain.<n><n>This is the exact same process used for solving a maths question. We ask ourselves, of the answers for each question, does any answer satisfy the requirement and if not, we ask what type of answer is more likely to satisfy the requirement. <n><n>For example, for the first question, are we looking for a green drink or a drink that contains 2 cups of sugar?<n><n>The answer is, well obviously, a drink that contains 1 cup of sugar as green drinks do not contain sugar.<n>And we can

But since the fox is seeking water, it can't simply be in a state of drought.<n><n>If the fox is searching for water in a state of drudgery, the only state that fits that description is Virginia (D).<n><n>And if the fox is somewhere else during the drought, the obvious answer is E (movie hall). The clue in the question is that the fox previously was, or at least has the potential to be, in the hen house.<n><n>Only A can accurately answer the question.<n>So, the correct answer is A: painting<n><n>Input: A scientist wanted to test a drug to help cure people with cancer, would it work, yes or no? Choices:  Yes:B:No:C:D:E:<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The key to answering this passage is to make sure all the pieces fit coherently.<n><n>The context of the question invokes a scenario involving scientific research. The only logical answer would be E, as other options are not suitable for scientific experiments.<n><n>The question also implies that the scientist has been testing other drugs that weren't effective, so they are unsure if this new drug would work.<n><n>Thus, the only logical answer would be D - No. None of the other options accurately describe the scenario.<n><n>And the final decision is E: No<n><n>Input:If someone is a ghost, does that mean they are dead, yes or no?Choices: A:Yes:B:No:<n>Output: Reasons:<n><n>The key question is to read the passage closely and identify an important piece of information that is not stated explicitly. It is clear that "ghost" is synonymous with "spirit".<n><n>So, the most suitable answer would be the correct answer, B - No. Since a ghost is not a deceased person, not everyone is immediately considered to be a dead body! If the scientist had instead asked the question, "If someone is a ghosts, does that mean they dead?" then the answer would be
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The evacuation became mandatory, so what came on the TV? Choices:  A: advisory B: mandate C: soap opera D: elective E: optional<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In the scenario, a sudden evacuation required people to be evacuated. This choice comes on the TV:<n><n>The first key is to pin down exactly what the scenario is describing - that is, a television show that was being interrupted to deliver an emergency alert. This is established by choice "mandatory" (B), which highlights the fact that the alert was required.<n><n>The next key is to determine if there is a more specific, related option that can be ruled out, even as the more general category becomes plausible. In order to do this effectively, it's crucial to understand the general purpose of an option with its related category. Does the category more generally relate to the subject, or does the specific option simply have more general significance? In this case, "advisory" (A), "soap opera" (C), and "elective" (D) can be ruled out because they do not relate to the nature of the TV show that's interrupted with information. Option "mandatory" is more specific with its plausibility, so the correct answer is "optional" (E), which implies a lesser degree of mandatorial requirement than its related category.<n><n>Input:What is the most important quality of a successful lawyer? Choices: 1) A: Integrity 2) B: Earnestness 3) C: Attitude 4) D: Sense of humor 5)E: Direction<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The first item that should be considered is the sentence that establishes the nature of the lawyer, to determine that "successful lawyers must maintain the quality of integrity" (A). This then enables the answerer to proceed with options B-E, which in most cases may involve the lawyer's personality.<n><n>As options B-E begin to be narrowed down, B indicates the "earnestness" (B) of a lawyer, which isn't very helpful as far as the lawyer's success goes. C indicates a "good" or "positive" attitude (C), which is of course necessary for a successful lawyer, but is not necessarily the most important attribute. D indicates a "sense of humor" (D), which is a personality trait that many lawyers may possess, but again is not indicative of success. Finally, the answer finally emerges in E with

The options "apply for a job" (A) or "stand in line" (B) are unlikely to net you any cash. Option (C) is the best one to choose, because this could be done for any kind of proposal or endeavor - it's not specific to any one type of job.<n>Option (D) is possible, but it's fairly unlikely that a single course will be enough to earn you all the money you could want.<n>Option (E) is the least likely possible course of action - this implies that you must put in significant amounts time and effort to earn the money that you want.<n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: reach tentative agreement B: suicide C: examine thing D: commit murder E: stay in bed<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first three options are the first three in order in the logical reasoning section. This question in particular, as with many questions, has a fairly simple logical choice behind it. As such, the answer would be obvious if you know anything about the logical reasoning section. In this one, however, it may be hard to comprehend what the exact answer should be as well as the reasons behind it.<n><n>Let's take a look at the options. "They decided to hash things off over drinks after enough booze" (A). This means that they drank a lot of alcohol, which would make them drunken. In this case, not being completely sober is definitely not a good idea.<n>Option "suicide" (B) is obviously the wrong answer. Not only because it contradicts the fact that this question is the logical reasoning section, but mainly because suicide is an extreme case scenario, and would not help them to solve their issues.<n>"What would they do if they examined things?" (C) sounds like it makes sense, but it doesn't, because there is no mention of them looking at anything. The fact that such an outcome is not mentioned does not make it a good option. "What would they do if there was a "tentative agreement"? (D) sounds pretty silly, considering there just wasn't a tentative agreement in the first place.<n>Option "stay in bed" (E) makes some sense. We all know the way drinks go. Drinks sometimes cause you to end up sleeping for hours on end. Because of that, this may seem like the most sensible choice, but consider this for a second. "Staying in bed" does not solve a situation and often worsens it.<n><n>After all this, we've come to the conclusion that "They decided to hash out things" (B) is the correct answer. Why? Consider the original text again, it says, "After enough booze they've managed to get close on a couple of things." This is enough information for us to know that they've started to feel a little more in sync. Because they've felt closer and managed to get "to know a couple of things" about each other, getting closer would probably lead to a more intimate outcome. That's why option (E) is obviously the correct answer - it doesn't even mention having

Choices:  A: joining B: put together C: stitch D: heal E: paste<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first element to look at is the context of the question - it invokes the word "scars", which gives the impression that the narrator is describing a painful experience. Thus, any answer that fits this context is a likely candidate.<n><n>The second element to consider is the specific words being used - "cut", "figurative", and "scars" gives a strong indication that the narrator is talking about past wounds, specifically a psychological or social wound.<n><n>The final element to look at is how the terms are used in their contexts - a "cut" is a physical wound that typically results in scars, whereas the word "sutures" refers to stitches. In this context, sutures would also be a valid answer choice, but as stated earlier in the instructions, it is more likely to describe a physical wound rather than a psychological or social one, which answers E (better understanding).<n><n>Answer: E<n>

Therefore, we should subtract the price of the cheapest apple from the price of the most expensive one. The difference, in this case, is $7.49.<n><n>Options 3 and 4 are incorrect because they compare the price of two different apples.<n><n>Options 5 through 7 use a different unit of measurement for price than expected in this context. "Price" (as a variable) is likely to be represented as dollars, since apples are bought and sold for money. Thus, these two options should be considered outliers or unusual choices.<n><n>Input: How long must you wait until you can see an episode of Game of Thrones?

Output: Reason:<n>I: if you travel more in time then your birth date you cant be born. II: If you travel more than 5 years before your date of birth and more than 15 years in the future, both of which are before and after your birth date, it’s not true that you can’t be born, right? So you can’t travel more than 5 ahead and 15 behind of your birth date.<n>IV: It isn’t necessary to visit a particular year to change the future and past.

Choices:  A: death B: coma C: peace D: forgetfulness E: loss of life<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>As the question is formulated, James' fear isn't explicitly stated. The sentence "he was scared of what" is left open-ended, and the options that follow each present a specific possibility that frightens James.<n><n>The option "death" (A), while plausible, isn't the only possibility.  James could be very afraid of losing consciousness. Perhaps being unconscious makes him uncomfortable due to the sensation of disconnection from everyday life that he might experience.  Or maybe he has a fear of dying or the unknown that would make him scared even in a situation that he would typically not be conscious.  Therefore, the answer is not B or D:<n><n>The options "coma" (B) and fear of being "forgetful" (D) both seem plausible. They would both scare James for potentially losing connection with the world around him and feeling disconnected from himself.<n><n>Then there's "loss of life."

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The city's community garden was demolished for yet another what? Choices:  A: wasteland B: ocean C: desert D: parking lot E: flowers<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>Similar to "learn more about", the context is paramount in the analysis. The information we've been provided states the city's community garden is being demolished. Thus, when we're looking at a possible outcome, it should be something that fits the context and the general description of destruction.<n><n>Options "wasteland" (A) and "pavilion" (C), both of which would require destruction of the garden to be built on the grounds, are plausible hypothetical outcomes, but not necessarily more likely. Also, neither option mentions flowers, which is a characteristic that defines garden (not that we know the full context).<n><n>We can exclude the options "desert" (B) and 'parking lot' (D).<n><n>The remaining options are all plausible in terms of the context. "Parking lot" (D) is a possible outcome that fits the context, as the city could opt to use the space for parking, but the answer requires more evidence to support that option.<n><n>The context supports the final option, "flowers", because "garden" (not defined but implied) generally implies growing flowers.<n><n>The final answer, therefore, is E: flowers<n>

Choices:  A: depressed B: downcast C: angry D: unhappy E: sorrowful<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer to A is "depressed", as "downcast" is more appropriate for feeling low down and "depressed" relates more to being sad due to a reason.<n><n>B is for "angry", so there is no other choice apart from A.<n><n>C, however, isn't an appropriate answer because "angry" relates to state of mind.<n><n>D is the closest answer, but isn't quite right. "Unhappy" is a state of mind and not an illness which has an impact of the well being of a person.<n><n>Thus, the final answer is A: depression<n><n>Input: Which of these names do we always have to capitalize? Choices:  a) all of them b) just the first c) none of them d) every other except "mister"<n>Output: <n><n>This question is a little tricky at first. The answer is ‘all of them”, because we have to capitalize the entire name if it is a full name, like “John Smith” or “Juan García”.<n><n>However, if the name is “Smith” or “Garcia”, it is not necessary to capitalize the family name when it is preceded by an article or an adjective.<n><n>Therefore, we have to follow ‘a’ and ‘b’ of the four choices and we have to capitalize ‘all of these names’.<n><n>Thus the answer to this question is D.<n><n>Input: What do these countries have in common? Choices:  (a) they're all countries (b) they're all islands (c) they're all in Europe (d) they're all African <n>Output: <n>The answer to this is either ‘b’ or ‘c’, because there is no such country as “all in Europe”, it is either in Africa or in islands.<n><n>So, answer to this is B: They are all islands. <n><n>

This was bad.  He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The context of the question and choice D (fists) makes it clear that "hand" is the intended meaning of "hands"; "fists" is a plural form of "fist", which is an extension of the singular form—"hand".<n><n>Answer choices:<n>A) This seems plausible, in that John was angry and agitated, or "hostile". But this doesn't necessarily mean he was only "hostile" in the sense of being irritable or having a short temper - it could also mean being violent or threatening.<n><n>B) Anger is commonly portrayed in modern American media as a male trait, so the option A (anger) seems more likely to come up in this context.<n><n>C) The reference to John's knuckles seems to imply that he was punching with only his fists - not his whole body weight or a weapon. Since "fists" is plural, it is safe to assume that John was punching with separate fists instead of one fist and hand. <n><n>D) The description of John bloodying his knackles when punching the wall would clearly imply that he used some hand strength to make an attack, not his arms or feet. "Hands" means "fists."<n><n>E) "Hold his tools" (A toolbox) is a metaphor for carrying out various construction tasks. Even if John was in pain from punching his fists, he would be still be able to carry out his construction tasks if he didn't injured them.<n><n>Input: One Saturday, as I was preparing for church with my family, we had guests. One of them was a man who I had not seen for three or four years. He asked me his last visit what was my favorite food? What was the first answer?Choices:  A: Soup B: Pizza C: Salad D: Potato E: Meat<n>Output:Reason:<n>Since the given context in option E is about food, "Meat" would be an unexpected but appropriate response from a male speaker. Option B (Pizza) is too likely the expected response for an African American male; option C (Salad) is too obscure; and option D (Potato) is too unexpected, given the context.<n>Also, options C and D present potato as

Choices:  A: new mexico B: forrest C: dessert D: garden E: creek<n>Output:		Reason:The lizard would surely surprise the person. The person could be taken by surprise from all directions. Reasoning:<n>The question is asking us to choose where we would a lizard surprise you if you were to see it.<n><n>The answer to this question can be found by first figuring out which of the answer choices are not places where a lizard would surprise you.<n><n>New Mexico and the desert would definitely surprise you to see a lizard in these places. The garden and creek are places where a lizard might appear, however, you wouldn't be surprised to see a lizard there.<n><n>There's only one choice left, forrest. Forrest is an appropriate location for a lizard to surprise you. Your expectations of what you'll see in the forest would not include a lizard. <n><n>Hence the answer here is B: forest.<n><n>Input: What time is it?

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: pantry C: grocery store D: pantry E: refrigerator<n>Output:		The pantry is a better choice for storing a jar likely to spoil if out. If it is placed in a pantry, it would not be exposed to extreme environmental conditions that might speed up the spoiling process. Storing it in the refrigerator would be equally effective if placed in a cool environment; the grocery store can be a bad option for a spoilable item if placed where it is more exposed to external conditions.<n><n>Input:What do you think is the most useful information in understanding the Earth's shape? Choices:  a - information about mass b - information about the distance between the Sun and the Earth c - information about the distance to the nearest star and other galaxies d - information about earth's magnetic field e - information about earth' speed around the Sun<n>Output: The most useful information in understanding earth's shape is the distance between the earth and the sun. This data would provide a better understanding of the earth's rotation period around the sun.<n><n>## Question 3:<n>Input:I wish i had my car key, what will i do? Choices:  a: drive my car b: go find it c: drive my car and go find it d: park it on the side of the street and look for it, and e: i will start looking for the car<n>Output: The car should take it slow and find the key. The best way to look for the car is by gradually scanning and searching for the key if you want to continue using it.

Choices:  A: looking good B: beauty C: tardiness D: handsomeness E: neatness<n>Output:		Reason: The word "grooming" carries the connotation of upkeep, and this type of upkeep is for the purpose of looking good. The best option which captures this meaning is "looking good," with "beauty" as the runner-up choice. Any of the other options are off-base because they suggest additional motivation for getting ready, such as to avoid tardiness or to impress a potential boss.<n><n>## 30.<n><n>Input:In the city, they have a high standard of living. Choices:  A. Better life B. Worse life  C. Higher standard D. Worse standard E. Lower standard<n>Output: Reason :Standard of living refers to the quality of life in a nation, city or region. From an individual perspective it refers to the quality of employment, housing, health care and education. From a wider perspective, standard of living can be seen as the level of development reached in an area and the amount of resources accessible or used.<n><n>## 13.<n><n><n>Input:The researchers created a test that would examine the effectiveness of anesthesia on patients?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:To learn must have the right book, to work efficiently what must one have? Choices:  A: improve yourself B: become knowledgeable C: have tools D: persistence E: have more knowledge<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>When answering these types of questions, it's important to keep in mind the context of the situation and what the correct answer should accomplish. In this case, the key information is centered around the benefits of having the right book: "to learn must have the right books", giving us a clue into what the answer should do. Additionally, the scenario makes it clear that the ultimate goal is for the person to develop in skill or improve in some way - "to work efficiently", "to become knowledgeable", "to have tools" all describe skills development of some kind.<n><n>This means that options involving improving yourself or becoming knowledgeable are correct - option B is correct because it focuses on the individual developing by reading the right book. <n><n>Option D is incorrect - it doesn't describe anything about what the person should accomplish after they've gained the correct book, nor does it address what the book is. It simply highlights the individual's qualities. <n><n>Option E is incorrect - while it may be true that "to have more knowledge" is also a benefit from having the right book, it isn't mentioned as a requirement and doesn't directly indicate what the person should do after obtaining the book. <n><n>Finally, option C is incorrect - it addresses having the right tool for accomplishing something, not having the right book.<n><n>So, the correct answer would be Choice B:  "become knowledgeable"<n><n>Input: What should be the next step for someone who wants to be a doctor?

The first step is to identify the context of the scenario and understand what is being asked. Then, one must determine the most appropriate and comprehensive answer given the context. One can identify the appropriate answer by analyzing the question in relation to the context of the situation.<n><n>Choices 1 and 2 are clearly options related to medical training, since they both involve internships and medical school. So answer A is incorrect. <n><n>Option C is related

Choices:  A: mountains countryside B: ground C: bridge D: mountain range E: surface of earth<n>Output:		 Solution: <n><n>The only possible place this question might be answered is with "mountains countryside", because the surface of the land has everything to do with the nature of the splash as determined by its relation to the ground. This would be the shortest distance to travel in order to create any splash, as the only other option is "bridge".<n><n>The remaining three choices aren't even grammatical. "Bridge" (C) is unnecessary, because there is no other place to throw something. <n><n>"Mountain" (D) means "mountain range" here, making it grammatically incorrect. <n><n>Finally, "the surface of the earth" (E) is a nonsense phrase. The "surface of the earth" would be covered by land.<n>So the final option is A: mountains countriside, as the answer to this question.<n><n>***Thank You***<n>

Additionally, a metro station is unlikely to have many options to buy amusement park tickets, since these tickets would likely be purchased elsewhere.<n><n>The fairgrounds, on the other hand, are known for selling tickets to amusement park. They serve as "convenient" venues for buying, selling, and distributing tickets, and can house a wide variety for purposes, including amusement park tickets at an amusement park!<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E- fairgrounds<n><n>Input: What type of transportation does suburban America use? Choices:  (A): Trains (B): Cars and Bikes (C): Trains and Bikes (D): Cars and Trains (E): Bikes and Trains<n>Output: Reasonnig:<n><n>The answer is trains, bikes and cars. The cars and bikes are both relevant in the context, they are used for conveyance, but they are suburban. Moreover, the trains are also used for conveyance, and are used in the suburbs. Thus 'cars', 'bikes' and 'trains' are all possible answers to the statement "suburban America uses... "<n><n> Input: Is this a good idea?

Choices:  A: home B: hardware store C: home D: hot room E: office<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>The question seems to be asking about electric fans that the hypothetical person might have. That narrows our search down to only five possibilities.<n><n>The first option (A) is the home, since that's where people have electric fans.<n>The second option (B) is the hardware store, but it's implausible for the person to go to the hardware store to cool their home.<n>The next two options refer to a specific room in the house, so there is no other plausible choice.<n>Finally, the fifth and final choice is the "office". While this answer sounds unconventional, the question is only asking about temperatures the person is cool with, not where they want the temperatures cool. So if the person is cool with the temperature in the office being cool, then of course they would like to have a couple of electric fans in that place.<n><n><n>Input:An animal is called a fish if its scales are covered in mucus.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:He had done a great job with the scary decorations, they were completely what? Choices:  A: terrible B: little C: halloween D: small E: horrible<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first question to ask is what type of word is "scary" (a noun.)<n><n>From there, it is helpful to group words to help the brain find patterns.  For instance, we look for nouns.<n><n>The next question is to think about what are the other words that could be describing "scary" (since we know it's a noun.)<n><n>The only other words that would be a common way to describe scary are "terrible", "halloween" and "small."  "Halloween" doesn't fit since it isn't a compliment. "Terrible" is used to describe a negative or poor outcome.  "Small" is also ruled out for similar reasoning.  That leaves "horrible" which is our final answer.  The final answer is E: horrible<n><n>Input: A man has his entire home gutted with a fire and it seems he loses everything he holds dear. The man's reaction is to what? Choices: A: get an additional life insurance policy B: throw a party C: get into a big argument D: go to the hospital E: do nothing for 2 days<n>Output:<n><n>First we decide that "man" is a subject, not a verb or object.<n><n>We look for nouns, since "gutted" is an adjective. These would be the options: "home", "fire", "things", "dear", "man", "party", "big argument", "hospital", "days".<n><n>What else can you think of that would be describing words?  These 2 are all that we're given, so now it becomes a matter of process of elimination.<n><n>If it was "going to the hospital" that option wouldn't be relevant if fire gutted his house, because he already has nothing left. <n><n>"Dear" is an adjective, so the final answer is E.  The final answer would mean he does nothing for 2 days because he lost everything dear to him in the fire. <n><n>The final answer is E: do nothing for a minimum of 2 days
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is done to wood to attach something to it? Choices:  A: nailed B: carved C: polished D: eat cake E: petrify<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To attach something to wood, you would "nail" (A) or "screw" (D) it to the wood. "Carve" (B) would involve cutting away part of the wood, which wouldn't accomplish the goal of attaching something to it. "Petrify" (E) involves turning an organic material into a solid non-organic substance, so it isn't used in the construction of a wood object. <n><n>The term "polish" (C) could also apply here, depending on how you mean it. Polishing would remove a thin layer of material from the surface of a wood object so the object becomes more glossy or lustrous. However, "carve" and "polish" could both also refer to the removal of material, so it is difficult to tell which one of these two words the question refers to. Therefore, this is the most ambiguous option here. <n><n>So, the correct answer is D: Eat cake.  <n><n>Input:Is there air in space? Choices: 1. No 2. Yes 3. No B: Yes C: No D: Yes E: 1 <n>Output: Reason :<n><n>"Yes" is the only answer that would mean "Air is found in space".<n><n>So the final answer will be: B: Yes.   <n><n>

They were dating for a while and wanted to be together for even longer. For this reason, they did what? Choices:  A: make sex B: plan to marry C: dance D: electrical circuit E: row about<n>Output:		Reason:<n>- John and Jane wanted to be together for a long time. "Marriage" (C) seems like a likely goal. But "dancing"(B) and "rowing" (E) don't make sense in the given context. <n>Option "electrical circuit" (D) seems to refer to something other than the relationship itself, or a goal to improve the relationship — not a good match for what the intended answer is.<n><n>Reason: The intended answer, "plan to marry" (C) fits the context best, as John and Jane want to improve their relationship by getting married.<n>Therefore, the final answer is Option "C: plan to marry”<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do you get for not moving your car during the required time? Choices:  A: towed B: accidents C: driving D: getting tired E: ticket<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The scenario invokes a certain time limit for moving one's car, which suggests that the individual in the scenario is being penalized for not moving his car within that time limit. This makes option "towed" (A) plausible.<n><n>The next task it to understand the details of the situation and determine how being penalized would impact their behavior. If the answer included "getting tired" (D), for instance, it could be interpreted as a negative consequence and might cause an individual to get tired (and not move their car).<n><n>On the other hand, if the answer included "getting a ticket" (E), it could be interpreted as motivation for someone to move their car - either to avoid getting a ticket, or to avoid being towed. Therefore, this would support not moving one's car.<n><n>Finally the last option is "accidents" (C). While moving a parked car to another location could result in accidents during the timeframe (e.g. someone banging into a parked car, or vice versa), it would be uncommon for those incidents to occur on such a regular basis that they required punishment. Therefore, this would not be a plausible reason for someone to get a ticket for not moving their car.<n><n>So the final answer would be C: driving<n><n>Input: What kind of workplace does not have a casual dress code? Choices: A: military B: hospital C: office D: library E: school<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>A casual dress code would be appropriate, and not uncommon, in the setting of a hospital. A military environment would have a completely formal dress code, which would go against the "casual" standard. Thus, option B (military) is eliminated because it's in direct opposition to the requirements of the question.<n><n>The same reasoning can be applied to the next three options that eliminate option "office" (C). These options all have formal dress codes, so the setting of the question must be an office without a formal dress code.<n><n>However, it is common for schools (E) to have a casual dress standard to facilitate learning. On the other hand, a formal dress code is uncommon within a library (D). This means we can eliminate option "library" and leave the answer at "school" (E).<n><n>As for answer

Choices:  A: buying B: purchase C: overpriced D: way to much E: expensive<n>Output:		 Reasoning<n><n>The first task in approaching this question is to understand the scenario and the context of the question, and to identify the timeframe of the event. Option "buying" (A) would make sense in terms of what the character might do, but is in a different tense than the question (which uses the present tense of "was/were"). <n><n>The next task to do is narrow down the tense of the possible answers to the question. It would be unlikely to use "was/were" in the present tense for items that are currently on sale, such as in the context of this scenario.<n><n>Therefore, the options that remain are "buying" (B) and  "purchase" (C). Both describe a purchase. However, the context and tense of the question suggest "buying" (i.e. something already available for purchase).<n><n>The final step is to determine the outcome or result of the purchase, and select the answer that makes the most sense. "overpriced" (D) would refer to an item that is more expensive than another item with the same characteristics, but does not make sense in this specific scenario (the game was on sale, so it would be a good deal, even if it was usually overpriced as opposed to another game). Answer "wayto much" (E) was the most plausible of the options because it doesn't make sense to use a single word to refer to "expensive" - if the game is overpriced, then it would already have been a good deal at the sale price.<n>So the final option is: D: was overpriced<n><n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where are people likely to stand at an intersection? Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Since there are no laws or physical restraints requiring that drivers stop at an intersection, they could decide on their own to do so. So, at the intersection, people would be expected to stand in any of the spots available at that location.<n><n>But, while there are no laws or laws requiring drivers to stop for pedestrians (especially if vehicles are moving at high speed, like on a freeway or expressway), many motorists would be expected to stop for pedestrian crossings in cities that have a lot of walkers. In spots that have a lot of pedestrians, cars and people would be expected to stop and wait, which creates traffic jams, which cause more delays, which cause more delivers, which increases the likelihood that a person crossing will get killed by a speeding automobile. In these cities, people at intersections would be expected more often to stand in at the corners or, crossing the road at a walk signal, stand at the corner of the road where the crosswalks are located rather than at the middle of the road.<n><n>So, the final answer is E

He was a bit upset that he had to do it, but he needed the job.  Still, he would have preferred it if the job were what? Choices:  A: present B: stay here C: closer D: available E: come here<n>Output:		Reason: The correct answer is E: ‘come here’, the word ‘come’ which is used in the sentence is used to express an action rather than a state.<n><n>Input:The teacher was trying to get her classroom under control.  She felt as if she were battling a losing battle.  She had just recently met several of her students and she was amazed how many things they seemed to know about that subject that they couldn’t be bothered to learn what? Choices: A: read B: remember C: have D: find E: understand<n>Output: Reason(s): This question is testing us on our comprehension skills. The sentences are written to test how well we can understand the situation and apply a solution. In order to answer what the teacher is battling a losing battle in her classroom, we take note of the sentence that has two instances of 'were'. The previous sentence is not describing a moment in the past or a future event (the teacher has just recently met students, 'had just recently' has past tense) but instead is describing a current situation in the class she is teaching. If the teacher were still 'battling' it would mean she has yet to achieve the goal of regaining control of the classroom.  Thus, we can know that she has not been able to regain control and is failing so far, hence 'losing battle'.  We can then know that we are to choose an answer pertaining to how well the students are understanding, and not for how they are reading the material or how well they remember facts.<n><n>Input:A scientist once made an amazing discovery. He discovered that electricity caused water to boil. He named his invention what? Choices:A: Tea Heater B: Electric Hot Water Heater C: Electric Hot Plate D: Electric Kettle Bubbler’s heated water, and this was his invention. It had taken a long time, and lots of money to work on it. He had spent his best efforts, but was it worth it? He thought so. His reward was well worth it when he got a patent! He loved seeing the world boiling with invention. He was proud of himself!<n>Output:Reason(s):The paragraph tells us that the'scientist once made an amazin discovery'.The paragraph tells us that he discovered that 'electricity caused

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: study french cooking C: taste sauce D: prepare food E: thin sauce<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, the first thing to do when solving this question is to break it down into its constituent parts.<n><n>In this case, we are asked what a chef does when he works in the evening. In cooking, the term "working in the evening" refers to the time just before dinner is served.<n><n>Based on this knowledge, the following reasoning can be made:<n><n>We can eliminate options B (study french cooking) and C (taste sauce). <n>It's unlikely that a chef who works in the evening would be involved in French cooking, as the course requires a significant time commitment, which would likely clash with other job responsibilities. <n>Moreover, the option to taste sauce only makes sense if he worked during the day, as doing so at night would not be beneficial.<n><n>The remaining options can be narrowed down to A (cook dinner) and E (thin sauce). The former answers the question - if a chef is working in the evening, he is cooking dinner for a restaurant, hotel, or other establishment. The latter involves the chef making sure that the sauce is thinned enough for it to be used.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E, thin sauce<n><n>Input: A chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for three-fourths of a cup of milk; in how many gallons of milk are 3/4 cups of milk?

Choices:  A: sneezing B: fatigue C: house clean D: feeling satisfied E: getting good grades<n>Output:		The question doesn't state much information, is it reasonable to think that this will happen?<n><n>The answer to this question would be either [A] or [D].<n>You could argue that the sneeze or fatigue could have prevented this by suggesting that their mother could have sneezed or gotten a headache while looking at the report card. However, the report card doesn't contain a reason to prevent it from happening such as a medical reason or any other excuses.<n><n>The question simply implies that he would have to do housework at one point this time or another. Therefore, this option is not reasonable and it is more likely that the [D] option would be true.<n><n>His mother seeing his report card, most likely is not a reason for this to happen and it is unlikely that his mother would see his report card and change her mind about him doing extra house work. If anything, she most likely would be happy about his new progress at school even though he didn't get a perfect grade.<n>The final answer would be [D]: he should have gotten better grades!<n>

Choices:  A: oklahoma B: university C: college campus D: players E: yard<n>Output:		The best answer here is "players" (D). The football field is the surface that a game of football is played on, and players are the main participants in the game. Thus, it makes sense that they would be the main focus on a football field. <n><n>Input: What is it? Choices: A: cow B: buffalo C: cat D: baby cow E: calf<n>Output: Cow (B) is the correct answer here, as a cows are a type of buffalo.

Option A would lead to "notoriety" (B) of the people telling their stories but this is not the correct answer option.<n><n>Option D: "bad dreams" (B) would likely be a consequence of telling stories about an embarrassing moment. This is incorrect also.<n><n>Option D is the right choice because it tells the person who did the telling.<n><n><n>Input: A group of people are trying to find a solution to a problem. However, they are all offering different approaches. Somebody tells them: "If you keep on discussing the possibilities, you will never end up with a solution." What will happen? Choices: <n><n>A: They will end up with a solution.<n><n>B: They will never end up with an solution.<n><n>The output is:<n><n>Reasoning:<n><n>One should be able to determine that the answer is B. If we have many people discussing the same subject, we will never get a solution because our brain cannot hold on more than one way to approach a problem. If we discuss something in one single way and focus on just one idea, it will be very easy to find a solution. So the right answer to this question is B.<n><n>Input: An object is made out of material X. A small part of it breaks down into two units - Y and Z.

Choices:  A: bike B: downtown C: building D: tool storage E: car<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question describes James as a wealthy man with an affinity for spending money on large purchases. Based on this context, it's fair to deduce that James has the means to build his own garage.<n><n>It's unlikely that options "bike" (B) and<n>"tool storage" (D) are correct, as <n>they would imply that James owns some very expensive bikes or a large tool collection.  <n><n>The answer option to the<n>question is "building" (C)<n><n>Input: I was going to move from Seattle to New York because they have what kind of building? Choices:  b: better fire codes c: better hospitals d: better apartments e: better schools<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>From the given context, the key here is the use of the word "kind" (b-e)<n>rather than "style" (d). A building can be described as having different styles - a brick apartment building,<n>for example, could have classic features and high-end finishes.<n><n>The building is likely to have different aspects, and the options that fit<n>this description are "better apartments” (D), and “better schools” (E).<n><n>Input:What can you drink from on Thanksgiving,<n>but not on Christmas? Choices:  B: mug C: glass D: cup E: ice cream F: teapot<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Based on the context of Thanksgiving being a holiday with large meals and Christmas being a holiday with gift giving, both involve<n>large gatherings of people and may be served refreshments.<n><n>Option A ("Mug"), however, appears to be referencing everyday drinkware rather than a special<n>drink server.  Choice C ("Glass") is probably too general - it could be referencing glass bottles or glass cups. <n><n>If we look at the other choices, Choice D ("Cup") is probably the best choice because it is referencing drinkware common<n>at Thanksgiving but unusual on Christmas.  Choice F ("Teapot") seems out of place, as we wouldn't imagine using a teapot <n>to serve refreshments for large group get-togethers.<n><n>It stands that the answers to which a mug is not used

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you sit in a chair to watch four-legged animals complete? Choices:  A: bookstore B: house C: race track D: friend's house E: building<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "bookstore" (A) would be logical for someone who wanted to study animals, as they often gather animal books there. However, this question specifically asks about the context of animal races. The only natural place to watch these animals is at a race track (D), so this would be the correct answer.<n>So the final option is  D: friend's House, this can be answer<n>### Instruction:Answer the question after reading these sentences.<n><n>Priya's son was in a bad car accident so her husband called the police.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What emotion do people expressing themselves show when they trip in front of a crowd and break their leg? Choices:  A: communication B: suffering C: pain D: laughter E: embarrassment<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again, the purpose here is to understand why a person would break their leg. "Breaking their leg" is a metaphor for expressing one's own feelings or opinions. The phrase "break their leg" conveys a sense of anger, frustration, or embarrassment - so these options are eliminated.<n>Option "communication" (A) is correct because it is a form of expression.<n>Option "laughter" (D) can be eliminated because it is not a form of expression. Option "pain" (C) is incorrect because even though it is a form of emotion, it occurs when a person is in physical pain.<n><n>The remaining options are "embarrassment" (E) and "suffering" (B). Option "embarrassment," however, is a temporary feeling which subsides after a brief period and is not an example of a prolonged expression of someone's own thoughts or opinions, so this option is eliminated as well.<n>Therefore, the final answer is B: suffering<n><n>Input: Why are there more boys than girls in this world? Choices:  They have different body parts.  A:  They have different genes B:  They like to play more. C:  They like to have fun.  D:  They fight less E: All of the above<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>It is suggested that there are more boys because there are more boys. This means that the options about body parts and genes can be eliminated.<n>The same explanation follows for option "A: they have different genes", as it is suggesting the same thing as the actual reason.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is D: They like to have fun<n><n>Input: If there were an army like 100,000,001 solder and they all went to war but if only one wanted to stop the war, they would not win the war? Choices: A:  They will lose the war B:  They will win the war C:  they will get 100,100,010. D: It doesn't really matter.  E:  Some will come back alive and the rest will die in war.<n>Output: Reason :They must get 100 million people together to win the war. <n>

Choices:  A: artist junkyard B: music store C: singing D: symphony E: orchestra<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here, the choice B) “music store” is the most appropriate response. The balalaika is a plucked musical instrument, commonly associated with Russian music, and is often depicted as being associated with folk art in a Russian setting.<n><n>Choice A) “artist’s junkyard” makes no sense in context.<n><n>Choice C) “symphony” is a word that is often misused by lay people in its common everyday terms as a vague synonym for “music” or “music band”. <n><n>Choice D) “orchestra” is a very long answer that doesn’t convey the intended meaning of the question.<n><n>So the final answer would be B: music store.<n><n>Input:The famous Italian painter Michelangelo was originally nicknamed “Dasino di San Miniato”. Choices:  A) Chocolate B) Chippy C) Spikey D) Cheesehead E) Big Cheesehead<n>Output:Reasonable:<n><n>Since this is a long question, the answer has to be taken as a whole. If not, the options will not fit. Since there are different people named Michelangelo, then the options must be associated to him, too. The options are 2) Spiny, 4) Cheese and 3) Spicy. The second one sounds like he was nicknamed that for his temperament, which makes no sense. Option four fits better with the answer that Michelangelo was an obese man. His fame, therefore, would come from being big. And he was.

Based on the context, the worst outcome would be one that resulted in immediate death, a serious health risk, or extensive financial loss.

Choices:  A: happiness B: pleasure C: happy D: grief E: isolation<n>Output:		Reason: As we've discussed previously, knowing the context of a scenario can help you eliminate some answers that seem irrelevant or out of place. In this case, the scenario implies some level of tension or strain in a marriage, which means the husband's likely to have a strong negative reaction to his wife's request.<n><n>In this case, options B (pleasure) and E (isolation) are both unrealistic and out of place in the scenario. <n><n>The remaining options would all be reasonable responses in this situation, but they're equally possible.<n><n>If the husband in question is indeed "happy" (A) or "grieved" (D), it wouldn't make much of a difference to his friends, who will probably feel the same way regardless. So neither of these options is a good choice.<n><n>The third option, "happy" (B), also wouldn't reveal much to his friends. The same applies to the fourth option, "grief" (C).<n>If the husband is "sad" (E), it is possible that his friends might also feel sadness or discomfort in his presence. However, it's more likely that they simply won't understand how he's feeling, resulting in awkwardness and incomprehension.<n><n>Therefore, the best answer to the question would either be neutrality (E), or "sadness" (F), which would cause his friends to show sympathy towards him.<n>

Choices:  A: interesting B: fun C: joyful or painful D: very important E: free<n>Output:		This question's purpose is to determine if the person likes learning, as indicated by the options A-D. A person interested in learning would generally prefer options A-C, while someone who doesn't like learning would prefer something like option E.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is C: joyful and E: free<n><n>Input: How can you help new person to understand something fast? Choices:  B: just show C: fast D: slow E: in easy way<n>Output: The answer is E (in easy way), to show that it is important to help the new person understand. Other options are irrelevant due to their negative connotations. For instance, C (fast) is not suitable because it implies to complete the task rapidly, which is not necessarily beneficial to the person. B (just show) is also problematic, as it only shows the person the task and does not take into account any other nuances, leading to a lack of comprehension on their side.<n><n>Input:What type of learning can you do when travelling? Choices:  C: Learning to learn, Learning from someone else, Reading,  D: Making some notes, <n>Output: The answer for this question is C. Choices A and B are irrelevant because they do not fit the scenario of travelling. For example, "learning to learn" (A) is focused on gaining knowledge, which is likely not what the person travelling is looking for. "Reading" (B) is not a form of learning per se, and therefore cannot be considered a type of learning while travelling. Options D and E are irrelevant because they suggest the person can learn without travelling. Choice C on the other hand, fits perfectly into this scenario by suggesting that the person could learn while travelling through interacting with their surroundings and observing their environment.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: control computer B: separate things C: go on vacation D: cross street E: go out<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The clues we have to examine in order to answer this question are "up prices" and "vacation", and these words imply the user is doing some sort of research or browsing to find the best option.<n><n>Option A could be a control room, but the wording of the question states "prices" and also doesn't suggest that the person is controlling something in particular.<n><n>Option B is about separating things, which could be possible, but there is nothing in the question to indicate that this is what the person is looking to do.<n><n>Option D is crossing a street, but there's no mention about crossing a virtual street in the question. Likewise, option C and E are about going on vacation, but how can the person control the prices if he/she is going on vacation?<n><n>Hence, the final answer is choice A:Control.<n>Input: The man was on a quest, what was on his mind? Choices: <n>A: computer B: car C: phone D: house E: map<n>Output: Reason<n><n>As usual we need to find the context of the question<n><n>It is a man who is on a quest and according to the question 'he is on a quest'. Quest is an active verb and as per the context it is active.<n><n>To find how he could have gained the objective, we will need to observe the options.<n><n>'Phone' sounds like a noun, but as per observation 'phone' is a verb.<n><n>'House' seems like a noun and also seems like being on the quest could have been his 'destination'.<n><n>'Car' and 'Computer' sound like nouns, we can safely eliminate them.<n><n>So the answer is 'house'<n><n>Input: It is the right time to go and have a snack what are you likely doing? A: going to dinner B: eating C: taking a break D: going for a walk<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Context of the question :<n>The first line tells us that it is the right time to have a snack so therefore it indicates that it is time for us to snack. <n><n>Option 1 :  The line also tells that someone is going to dinner, which means that someone is either ordering or taking dinner but not having it. <n><n>Option A is eating

"Farmer's market" is not a location and so cannot be eliminated. "Woods" is ambiguous, as a person can be surrounded by trees almost anywhere (backyard, forest, etc.), making "Indiana" a good guess. <n><n>The only remaining locations that the woman could be surrounded by numerous trees would be either "New York" (with a dense urban population across the island of Manhattan) or Illinois (a heavily forested state located in the Midwest, bordering Indiana). Therefore, "New York" and "Illinois" are our answers.<n>

Choices:  A: bus stop B: street corner C: roadblock D: fast food drive thru E: city<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This MCQ has nothing to do with programming, or even anything relevant to programming for that matter. It's all about context - what would you find a sign that says, "some people lined up next..." at exactly?<n>The options have been chosen in chronological order of the actions which could be performed by the people next to such signs.<n><n>The first place would be where you would find a sign with some numbered people lined up next (line up next?).<n><n>And to the second option, "where would you find such a sign" would naturally follow the line up part, and so a street (corner) comes next.<n><n>The third option, "however, a roadblock on a highway would be another common location." This is not the scenario since we don't need to find such a thing. <n><n>And to the last option, "the other option could of course be some sort of fast food establishment if the sign actually meant that'some people are currently lined up next in the drive through', as might be the case at a particular Wendy's at 10 pm on a Tuesday." This is an unlikely scenario as no fast food drive thru would run 24 hours everyday.<n><n>The correct answer would be B: street corner<n><n>Input:How would you get home from work after the office closed?

Choices:  A: washing machine B: space shuttle C: blender D: disneyland E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here, the question asks what appliance, so options (A, B, and C) are irrelevant and (D) is an irrelevant location. That leaves (E) as being the best answer. <n><n>Input: How many bones does the human body have? Choices: 						 A: 206					 B: 209					 C: 256				 D: 290					 E: 300<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>"How many bones does the _human_ body have?" gives you a strong narrowing point. You can eliminate (B) because it's too tall and (C) because it's 76 short. <n><n>That leaves you with three options: 206, 209, and 300 -- all very close to each other. Of these, you know the closest of the three to be correct. <n><n>Input:#15 = what number? Choices:  < A: 16 < B: 15 < C: 17 < D: 14 < E: 25<n>Output:Reasonung:<n><n>First, you can reject options (D) and (E) because they are too low. <n><n>Next, consider that this is a multiple choice question and the correct answer (and indeed only answer) is an integer. So if you divide the options by 10 and go through it again, you can rule out all but 2 of the 4 possible integers (25, 16, 15, 17) that would fit. The only question that might still stump someone is the difference between 16 and 15. So you can either mention it explicitly or have a hint saying, "Think of the difference between two numbers that are close together."<n>Refer to this for all the methods<n>

Choices:  A: sadness B: happiness C: amusement D: losing money E: anger<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Joy," which the answer is saying, is a positive feeling, so no answer is sad, angry, or losing money. "Family" means more than one person, so there cannot be anyone alone. Happiness is possible, since they are full of joy, but cannot be sad. That eliminates A and B.<n><n>"Amusement," option C, may sound appropriate, but the context is joy, and the answer refers to the whole family being full of joy, so amusement is not appropriate.<n><n>Finally the right answer is D: happiness<n><n>Input: The child’s mother was preparing food in the kitchen, the boy suddenly ran into the kitchen and asked his mother, “what are you cooking right now? “<n>Output: Reason:-<n><n>The answer is option “B: vegetables.” The answer refers to the child’s mom cooking vegetables, so the kid wouldn’t ask what his dad is cooking right now.<n><n>The word “kitchen” in the question tells us that the child is male and the boy has a dad, which we can eliminate E and A, since a boy can have a mom, but not a dad. Option A also doesn’t make sense since a kid wouldn’t ask his mom for food because it’s right in front of him or her.<n><n>Option C is more likely, but the kid is asking a question, so option D is the answer to the question. <n>So the final answer if option “B: vegetable.”<n><n>Input: There is a certain room, and there is a certain item in the room, where will this item be found?

Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n>Output:		Reason answer<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question as follows:<n><n>The question assumes that you have been asked to choose between either an aquatic workout or an exercise to the shore.<n><n>Based on this assumption, answer choices A and E (working out at sea and at land, respectively) are irrelevant.<n><n>Choices B and D (a beach and a shore workout) can be classified into either a land or a sea exercise, which makes them irrelevant as well. <n><n>Option "swim at sea" (C) may seem like it could be categorized into either the shore or the sea, yet a more in-depth analysis of its grammatical structure shows that its phrasing implies that you would be swimming in the sea because a body of land is not "nearby". This answer is therefore plausible.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the question as:<n><n>The grammatical structure of this question makes it almost impossible to answer with options B and C.<n><n>The "land" referred to in answer choices B and C is the same "land" implied in Option C. That is, the options A and B are implying that you would have enough room to "work out properly" near the shore, not at sea. <n><n>For that reason, options B and C are irrelevant.<n><n>It seems that a more likely scenario is that the question assumes you are swimming in the sea, or else there would be a need for more specific grammar in the question.<n><n>This means that that options A and C would be the most suitable.<n><n>Answering the question with Option C then becomes the most suitable answer.<n><n>input: You want to sell 14 candy bars for $1.50.

Choices:  A: fly B: milk cows C: eat D: answering questions E: fail to work<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>When it comes to artificial intelligence, machines are capable of a wide range of tasks. But one of their most notable strengths is machine intelligence's ability to effectively tackle data processing.<n><n>This is not to say that machines don't have flaws when it comes to data analysis. For instance, they can struggle with working in high-stress environments. Yet, this is rarely expected of them, as the data they process is more often than not not stressful. Even when they are required to work in high-intensity environments, the results could still be efficient.<n>To put things in context, machines could be likened to accountants. While humans are capable of doing the job, machines possess far greater efficiency at this task. They aren't necessarily more intelligent than humans; they work differently.<n><n>The last option, "fail to work," is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the actual strength of machines when it comes to data processing. While machines may encounter some limitations in certain situations, this doesn't mean that they will fail to work.<n>So the final choice is the answer is E: fail to work.<n><n>Input:How are smartphones designed to do away with the need for a desk?

Smartphones were introduced in the market, and they immediately became popular due to the convenience they provided. The introduction of this device has made calculations more portable, accessible and simpler.<n>The other options are not applicable to what the question is asking, so they can be rejected.<n>The answer is E, having a built in calculatord.<n><n>Input:What was the name of the first cellphone that was introduced in the market in 1983 or 1984 by Motorola?

Choices:  A: deceptive B: altruistic C: stupid D: cruel E: agressive<n>Output:		Reason:<n>As a member of our team, I always have to do my research for this question. I have always found that it is a lot faster when you choose the wrong answers first.<n><n>As we all know, cruel people are often hurtful to others, and so A is ruled out because we already know A(cruel) does NOT equal B(not cruel).<n><n>Stupid people are also often harmful because they aren't always smart enough to know how to harm people in a more indirect way. So if D(stupid) were equal to E(cruel), then we know C would be incorrect because of the commonality between stupid and cruel people, but we know C(not stupid) does NOT equal E(not cruel). Thus we can immediately eliminate C, D, and E.<n><n>Of course we know B(not cruel) equals C(not stupid), which means that B is correct. (In other words, altruistic people, by definition, are not cruel. Some may even be kind.)<n>This answer doesn't use any advanced logic, and just focuses on common sense rules. (You can get the same answer without this method, but this has saved me multiple hours of solving in the past week)

Choices:  A: being understood B: beer C: playing around D: hug E: visiting friends<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>As a student, I usually try to look for different sources of learning.<n>The first step in this scenario is to understand the context, which means I must first understand the meaning of the verb "trying". Trying can have a negative connotation, which suggests that the scenario has something to do with overcoming a challenge.<n><n>One option that is not an accurate option is Option (A), which suggests that someone wants to be understood. Although this may be a common desire, it doesn't fit the overall context. <n><n>Option (D), which reads "want[s] hug", also doesn't quite fit the context. Although physical contact is important in human interactions, it is more likely that the option is referring to a type of physical contact, such as touching, which doesn't fit the context of the scenario.<n><n>Option (C), which reads "wanted to play," is a bit more ambiguous, but it seems to allude to physical activity in some way, which could be a possible outcome of a fun activity with friends. Option (E), which reads "wanna[s] to visit their friends," could also be considered one of the potential outcomes of fun activity with friends, but it seems to refer to physical contact, which goes back to option (D).<n><n>Both "visiting" and "playing" both allude to spending time with friends, which could result in feelings of intimacy, and this scenario is asking what someone want when engaging in fun activities with friends. "Hug" is probably what would be expected in the scenario.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: Hug<n><n>Input:If a group is going to do something it is probably the most efficient to get all the people involved to decide together which way to do it.

Choices:  A: crack B: antipathy C: being mean D: disinterest E: unfeeling<n>Output:		Reason:<n>As in the previous example, it can be beneficial to identify the central subject matter of the question. <n><n>The word "girl" indicates that she is a child, and she is self-centered, but her behavior may not be fully selfish. <n><n>Next it helps to decide what she is doing. The options that make sense are "crack" (B) and antipathy (C). However, the word "feeling" in the question indicates that she acts or behaves in a particular manner, so she is likely not "crack" (i.e., her behavior is not based on feelings or emotions).<n><n>The other option, "antipathy," means to be disliked by someone else, so this doesn't fit either, since the child is the central subject of the question.<n><n>This leaves us with the option, "disinterested," which is defined as being "not interested in" or unconcerned. This option fits the question. Therefore, the most accurate answer to this question would be "disinterested".<n><n># Test 4<n># Input: What makes you feel special in our family? Choices: 1) My parents always told me they loved me. 2) My brothers always had my best interests at heart. 3) We all had each other's backs when we faced tough situations. 4) My uncle always supported my dreams and never ridiculed me. 5) We always had an open line of communication.<n>Output: Reason Answer:<n>The first step is to figure out who the subject matter of the question is. In this case, it is clearly "you".<n><n>Next, we have to decide on what the question means by "special". Based on the description the writer is using, it seems that they expect an answer that pertains to how "special" they are to the family or how much they value them. 3 and 4 both pertain to each other, but 3 is the main subject of this question. <n><n>Next we have to decide what we are talking about. This question has a list of responses. We need to ask ourselves what makes each of those responses special. Is it the way the people interacted with themselves or are they special because they had that trait in the first place. 1 and 2 fit this question best because what

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The other passengers on the bus were quite loud, so he put on his headphones to relax and what? Choices:  A: go to bed B: sleep C: listen to music D: stretch out E: stop worrying<n>Output:		<n><n>Reasoning:<n>The instruction is the same as the previous input. The only difference is the word "passengers". This tells us that the noise comes from people on the bus and not from within the headphones.<n><n>After clarifying that, the next step is to find the reason why the person in this scenario chooses to put on headphones. The answer options should each explain how headphones help the person relax or what the benefits are.<n><n>Option "sleep" (B) fits this criterion. Headphones could be used for sleeping, which would be a common activity to engage in on a bus trip. <n><n>Option "listen to music" (C) doesn't explain why headphones are chosen for this situation. It's more generic than the other options because it applies to any activity that involves music.<n><n>Option "stop worrying" (E) is unlikely to be the true purpose of the headphones. They're on the bus, surrounded by people - it's unlikely that the person would be "worrying" just from the fact that they're riding the bus. <n><n>Option D: stretch out is very unlikely. It's mentioned in a sentence that describes a man sitting down, which contradicts the intended answer.<n><n>Hence the final answer is B: sleep<n><n>Input: A team's star quarterback injured his arm during the game, and in order to give an accurate diagnosis, the team's doctor needed to obtain a history of the injury.

Output: <n><n>ReasoningThe task is to first understand the purpose of obtaining a "history" of the injury, and then identify the reason that motivated this approach.<n><n>Option D, to "develop appropriate expectations", doesn't provide specific details about why obtaining a history of injury is necessary. Furthermore, being "happy and healthy" is not a medical outcome.<n><n>Option E, to "ensure that the patient doesn'ts misremember details of their injury", would be

The question is somewhat ambiguous, since it does not give us any information. However, by considering the question's title, we can conclude that the man in question is 16 years old. The 19 could be an ambiguous number of years that he gave to find his age, or the total age of himself and his wife. However, for the sake of the question, we will assume that the man is 16 and his wife is 25.<n>If we add 19 to this age, we get 35. If

Choices:  A: toy store B: story book C: great outdoors D: countryside E: wildlife refuge<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>There are several options for the first part - the child naming the giraffe "a cow", but all except B are irrelevant. A "toy store" (option A) is not necessary for the child to have an experience that would become a fond memory. A countryside (D) or wildlife refuge (E) does not necessarily have to be a fond memory either. There is no clear description of a fond memory in the question.<n><n>And option C does not make sense - it's about the great outdoors, not the countryside. The question also uses the word "what" instead of "where", so we can eliminate C from the options. <n><n>It is also a little contradictory to ask why the mascot was named a cow, and then use the word "now" to indicate the mascot is no longer around. That leaves us just with the last three remaining options. But that does NOT necessarily mean option E is correct.  <n><n>Here, the child in the story is now an adult. This could mean he/she had left the town or it may mean he/she had grown up. But regardless, there is no reason to assume that option E is necessarily correct. <n><n>Now for the second part, the "now defunct", i.e. no longer around. There is a possibility that the mascot is a living, breathing animal, and simply has died. We cannot eliminate this option, because the context is not clear. <n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is B: story book, because of the last line of the story, which specifies that the giraffe is a character in a book. It is not a mascot, so the character is no longer around - it was simply a fond memory from a book.<n><n>Input: Which of these choices describes the relationship between the two options?  Choices:  A.A is a type of B.An option in B is A.A<n>Output: Reason::<n><n>The two options in this question can be read as either one word or two. However, there are only two options in the choices, so we can rule out ambiguous sentences such as "B is an option in A" with only two choices of "A" (option A, or option B).<n><n>Therefore, we are left with choosing whether "A is a type of" (option A) or

Choices:  A: driveway B: the event C: scrap heap D: parking garage E: repair shop<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First, we need to identify the context of the question and the motivation behind the man's decision. Apparently, commuting to and from work in a car is more trouble than it's worth. Therefore, he wants to move somewhere where he doesn't have to rely on a car for transportation.<n><n>The first three choices do not satisfy the intentions of the man:<n><n>"Driveway": The driveway is where he would park his car. If he has a car, he probably would not have decided to move.<n><n>"The scrap heap": The man presumably would not want to discard his car or replace it with one that's worse.<n><n>"Parking garage": Though it's a viable option for the man to park his car and take a bus, it doesn't reflect the man's desire to commute without his car.<n><n>Then, based on the previous reasoning, we can eliminate choices: A, B, and C. The remaining choice is E. As the man is not looking for car troubles or to discard his car, the answer is the repair shop.<n><n>Input: After having a terrible performance at the gym, the young man decided to hire a personal trainer who is what?

Choices:  A: train station B: baseball stadium C: lottery D: movie E: bus<n>Output:		Reason/Analysis:<n><n>Here the problem has asked us to select the destination which would need a "ticket". For a "baseball stadium" (B) the answer is no. Although a ticket is required to enter the stadium, it won't take you any further to go to a different country.<n><n>Similarly, the option "movie" (E) is not correct either, because one might need to purchase a ticket to gain entry into the movie venue, but this won't help in traveling to a different country. Therefore the following options (A-D) will require tickets to travel to different country. Therefore as per the question we can say that "a ticket would help you to get to A different country".<n>Hence the final answer is A: different country<n><n>Input:What part would you pull out from the ground if you wanted to make a table? Choices: 	 A: trashcan B: firewood C: saw blade D: table E: shovel<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The answer lies in the question itself, we'll be pulling OUT anything from the ground. Therefore the options D: table and E: shovel are out of the question. Next we'll have to be careful as one of the option might be an inanimate object which cannot be pulled out.<n><n>Therefore as mentioned in Option A: "trashcan" cannot be pulled out. Hence the final answer is C: saw blade<n><n>Input:Where does a bird fly in order to not become sick? Choices: A: to the ground B: to its own nest C: to the north D: to somewhere higher than the sky E: to somewhere lower than the ground<n>Output: Reason.<n><n>Option "to the ground" (B) is incorrect since that's exactly where birds live most of the time. Therefore, we rule out option B: "to the ground".<n><n>Also, option "to its own nest" is incorrect, since the bird would stay in its nest the entire time.<n><n>The only correct answers are "to the north" (D) and "somewhere lower than the ground" (E). Therefore, among these choices, the correct answer is "somewhere lower than ​the ground".<n><n>Input:What did the scientist study on the mice? Choices: A. Their muscles B.

Choices:  A: look at B: write down C: learn new D: think about E: discovery of new<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in solving this puzzle is to discern whether the detective is gathering or analysing the information, since the question is phrased as a noun ("clues") rather than an action ("to analyse").<n>Option "look at" (A) is unlikely because the detective is analyzing clues, not looking at them.<n><n>The next step may seem counterintuitive: to eliminate any of the answers that are clearly the opposite of what the detective wants to do.<n>Because the detective is supposedly analysing clues, any answers that suggest "writing down" (B) or "learning more" (C) are excluded.<n>The remaining two possible answers are "thinking about" (D) and "discovery" (E).<n>Based on the question, the option "discovery" does not seem likely. The detective is in fact analysing clues for his current case, so "discovery" is less relevant as an answer.<n>That leaves option "thinking about" as the correct answer.<n>The final choice: D: think about<n><n>Input:The scientist needs to do what with the data?, to make sure he's got everything, for better understanding, to find out for himself, to know when the last time was B: he wants to what C: he wants to know D: he wants to learn more E: he wants to know best<n>Output: Reason<n><n>As with the previous puzzle, we will discern whether the scientist is gathering or analzying the information by looking at the noun.<n>There are two key words that can lead us to the correct answer: "data" (which connotes a gathering process) and "the data" (which could refer to an analytical process ). If "data" were used as a noun with a definite article, it would mean that the scientist is simply gathering information, and that would be a reasonable answer to this question. This isn't the case: "the data" isn't defined for us, and is the only option that uses the definite article to describe "the data", which means he is actually performing an analytical process ("learning more" could be a plausible outcome of an analytical process, but we can't know for sure). The remaining key words that refer to scientific analysis are "

We can see Sam used forth, and the last word he speaks is something related to back. So we can deduce the next word is "tally" to mean totalling and add on "back" or "back". By applying the principle back and forth, we can have a total of 6 options.<n><n>Then we need to determine which of the 6 option is the common saying.

It could be that the question is inquiring what amenity can be expected in a shower room, which is a possible explanation that would fit all options except "shower" (A), which could be considered a redundancy. However, it isn't.<n><n>Next, what is being asked is which type of room the shower is in. Here, the option that describes showers in general ("showering room") would be "showers" (A). So the shower in the question is either a "showering room" or a shower room. The first one - which fits the best - would be "showers". Therefore, the answer is "shower" (B).<n><n>### A: the gy mnasiu m<n><n>Input:What is the most common type of shower? Choices:  bath tub  A: wall shower B: bathtub C: shower head D: handheld shower E: rain shower<n>Input:What is another name often used for a shower?

Choices:  shower bath  A: wall showers B: handheld showers C: shower room D: rain showers E: bath tubs<n>Output:ReasoniNg:<n><n>In the first option, an "amenity" (A) would be something extra, such as a toilet or a bathtub, that you would typically find in a hotel room. Here, the word "showering" would be redundant, since it refers to everything that's related to the bath or shower itself.<n>So the answer would be "showering" (A), which makes option (B) invalid.<n>In the second option, it is implied that when you reserve a room, you can choose whichever amenities the room would have. Since a room has a shower, it would then be a shower room. So option (C) isn't a choice.<n><n>The third option is "use the majority". When someone is asked their opinion on how to use an amenity in a specific fashion, it

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can you store you tent and keep it on your person? Choices:  A: sleep in while camping B: camp ground C: woods D: bag E: backpack<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>At a camping ground, one may choose to sleep in their tent while the tent is placed on the ground. However, "sleep in" is not a sufficient explanation of how one would store their tent on ground while they also stand on the ground, because <n>while lying down, one would not stand on the ground.<n><n>The correct choice (C) describes the action of placing a tent on the ground in a very specific manner - "in some woods" would indicate a location at some distance from the site where one is actually standing, which is what option "campground" (A) describes.<n><n>Furthermore, the fact that the word "in" is used along with "sleeping in," rather than "sleeping," illustrates that this answer choice is meant to convey the action of placing the tent in one location while remaining in another, as in "stores in, keeps on person," not "uses in, keeps on ground," and "tent on person, uses" (A) is not a suitable choice.<n><n>Option "backpack" (E) is not a suitable answer, because one would place a tent in a tent bag (or "backpack," as it is sometimes called) instead of storing the tent on one's person.<n><n>Without an appropriate description like "in some woods," this phrase describes the location of the tent on the ground, whereas the question is asking to which location one may store one's tent when on the ground. Therefore the correct answer is C: woods

He lived with his children because he didn't want to go where? Choices:  A: republican party B: old people's home C: office D: park E: high school or college<n>Output:		Reasoning :<n><n>First thing first, the term "children" in question one and the term senior are synonymous. We should consider "republican party" (B), "old people's home" (C), "office" (D), "park", and "high school or college" (E) as different from each other and from "senior". <n>Then according to the context clues,we can determine that these terms mean that "senior" has kids "he lives with" and he does not want to go where: "high school or college", "office", "park". <n>Next, let's look at the context and make logical inferences about the answer choice. The word choice "where" (F), is synonymous with the word "with" because Lindy is going somewhere with his children or with his senior. So we can eliminate choices (D) and (E). <n>Moreover, it is known from the given context that the answer choices(B), (C) and (F) are not where seniors live. So these three answer choices can be eliminated. <n>Finally, the given context leads us to make this conclusion: the answer is (F) "office", because Lindy is not going to any park(E), high school or college (F) but to his office.<n><n>So the final answer : "office"<n><n>Input:The man ran 3 miles on Saturday in 25 minutes.On Sunday he ran 6 in the same time .Then how many miles did he run in all? Choices: 1: 10 miles 2: 18 miles 3:11 miles 4:23miles 5:10 miles <n>Output:Reason:<n><n>At first, according to the given context, we should look at the answer choices to determine the range in which they could fall.<n><n>It's clear that "18 miles" (2) and "23 miles" (4) fall outside this range and can be eliminated. Similarly, "11 miles" (3) has two more digits than the number of miles he ran in one day, and this too may be crossed off.<n>This leaves "10 miles" (1) and "10 miles"(5).<n>In the text of this question, it is stated that he ran three miles during the

Choices:  A: to be heard B: receive gifts C: understand themselves D: good things in life E: acknowledgment<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again, the purpose of the question - to understand the motivation behind getting counseling - comes into play.<n><n>"To be heard" (A) is a common motivation in many situations, and may apply in some contexts outside counseling (for instance, at an interview, in a court of law, or while seeking aid from a friend/family member/loved one in times of need).<n>Unfortunately, that's not what the situation calls for: the person is going to counseling, and therefore the correct answer has to be something specific to that context.<n><n>"Receive gifts"?? (B), perhaps in the form of some sort of incentive for staying in counseling? But in the context of receiving counseling, that doesn't seem possible.<n><n>"Understand themselves"? (D) is a plausible motivation, but still vague. Again, it doesn't fit the context of the question, as the one who is counseled is the person going to counseling (a person going to a doctor, for instance, wouldn't likely be motivated simply by understanding themselves), not the counselor.<n><n>"Good things" (E) might fit, but this choice isn't specific to counseling, meaning it's more plausible that the person in question wants a better life in the future, rather than a deeper understanding of today's situation.<n><n>Only one option remains. Choice (E) "acknowledgment" fits the purpose behind going to counseling: seeking to gain more insight into one's situation.<n>So the final choice is E: acknowledgment<n><n>Input: Which one of these things is a method for getting rid of things you don't need? Choices:  a: cleaning your room b: hugging c: donating d: throwing things away <n>e: using a garbage disposal<n>Output:Reason: A garbage disposal is a method of getting rid of things you dont' need by throwing them away. But that is not the only way to throw things away. Cleaning your room is a way to get rid of things you don not need by throwing them away with your hands. Throwing away is the method, and cleaning your room is the way that you do such<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question

Choices:  B: It’s useless to have a wider door. C: There is no reason to do it.<n>Output:It’s a tricky question because it does not specify if a door, or a room, does not exist already. If a room already exists with a door wide enough for humans to walk through, then adding an extra 2 inches per side will leave the whole structure intact. However, if there are no doors in the room and it is necessary to make the door wider than 12″, then obviously the room must contract along the new wall.<n><n>Input:Why don’t bicycle helmets protect your head from bicycle falls? Choices:  D: They make people slow bikers.<n>Output:Reason:This question is a trick question. A bike helmet protects our heads when we fall. Bicycle falls are more likely to cause an injury to the brain because the head is thrown forward and is more likely to hit a solid object such as the ground.<n><n>Input:What did the man say when he hit his head?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The old barn was beyond repair, they had to destroy it before they could what a new one? Choices:  A: make B: raise C: entice D: build E: fix<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First, we eliminate "make" (A)! This phrase is used when making something, such as a dish in a kitchen. Using it in this context would create a misleading association.<n><n>Next, we eliminate "fix" (B). Fix is an informal verb meaning "repair," but "fix" is too informal here. The verb needs to be closer to "make."<n><n>Next, we need to eliminate "build" (D). The correct answer should indicate a new barn or a new addition to the old barn. "Build" is too vague. It could mean a new addition to a barn or an entirely new barn from the ground up.<n><n>Finally we eliminate "entice" (C). "Entice" is not an action verb that describes construction. "Build" or "make" would be better choices.<n><n>So "build" is a better choice. This is accurate because the barn is beyond repair, so it will have to be rebuilt or destroyed to make way for a new one.<n><n>Input:When will come the rainy season? Choices: A: spring fall B: winter summer C: the autumn spring D: the rainy year E: dry year<n>Output Reason:We need to identify the correct season based on the question. The phrase, "when will come the rainy …" means that the rainy season has not yet occurred. This leaves us with the options "spring …" and "fall …"<n><n>However, "spring …" (B) is incorrect because spring is not a season on its own. It's a part of another season (in the northern hemisphere it's part of summer) and its presence in this part of the sentence means that the two halves of the sentence are out of order.<n><n>Therefore, "fall …" (B) needs to be the correct choice. This is accurate, so the correct answer is "fall …" (D).<n><n>Input: What does the letter "Y" stand for in NYC?

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: eat C: go back to work D: make food E: get food<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to note is that the scenario is asking about the purpose behind the "they". It's not about the intention of people in general to eat at home, or to travel to the supermarket. It's only about what specific purpose the people have when they decide to go out of the house in the first place.<n><n>Hence, all irrelevant options should be eliminated. Those options are: "cook dinner" (A), "go back to work" (C) and "get food" (E). The option "eat" (D) can be excluded because it doesn't mention the idea of going back to the house at all.<n><n>From the remaining options, the option "make food" (B) is plausible because food prep is a step in the process of cooking, and the only other option left is "go home". This seems obvious because that is the ultimate goal of people who need to cook from home. <n><n>So the final answer would be A: make food<n><n>Input: What was meant when saying they were planning to go on a field trip? Choices:  (A) a vacation  (B) a visit to the zoo (C) a hike (D) all of the above  (E) none of the above<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>To answer this question, it helps to parse out the wording of the question as well.<n><n>The question asks about the meaning of "field trip", not what they were planning to go. Hence, only two choices are relevant: A or D.<n><n>The relevant choice is "all of the above" (D) because if they were intending to go on a vacation, it would definitely involve visiting the zoo and a hiking. In fact, it could very well be that they were visiting the zoo and then going for a hike. So all of the options are certainly relevant.<n><n>If they didn't intend to visit the zoo - which is the case when "all of the above' is eliminated - then this question would be trivial to answer.<n><n>So the final choice is D: all of the above<n><n>Input: In the morning, you hear a dog howling.

Therefore, the next action will be to walk to the cashier to finish the whole shopping trip on that day. But it's still too early for a shopping trip to be over. You don't have to go to the supermarket to find some shopping carts to get bags.<n>So it's not a supermarket.<n>You don't have to use a shopping mall because a shopping mall is a place where a shopping center is set up.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you put a handle if you want to bring it with you? Choices:  A: briefcase B: coffee cup C: carry object D: frying pan E: on a hat<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Option D: a frying pan is indeed a handle. So the answer is C: frying pan<n><n>Input: Is a "Snicker's bar" an animal? Choices:  Snicker's bar - a type of animal Snicker's Bar - a type of candy Snicker's Bar is a Snicker's Bar Snicker's Bar isn't a Snicker's bar Snicker's bar, isn't a Snicky's bar, either.<n>Output: No it's not a Snicker's... it's a Snicky's. That's what's confusing.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:while luck plays a big role, every person who is great at something has focus and what to it? Choices:  A: hatred B: surprised C: compliments D: dedication E: solutions<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The question requires a specific outcome from the "every person who is great at" - which would be the focus of their success. <n><n>Option "hatred", while a common answer for failure, would be unlikely for the description of an expert. Hatred would not be associated with focus and what to it. It appears more likely that the focus of the great person would be compliments and positive reinforcement.<n><n>Option "surprised" (B) would be unlikely, as a surprised reaction goes against the idea of focus and dedication.<n><n>The most relevant option is "dedication" (C), as the other three (competence, skills, etc) are unlikely for "every person" or "great". In conclusion, the "focus and dedication" to their craft is a better answer to the question. <n><n>So the final answer would be C: dedication<n><n>Input: while luck plays a big role, every person who is great doesn’t work in isolation. They draw inspiration from what? Choices: A: a mentor B: the crowd C: competition D: the stars E: the world<n>Output: Reasonening:<n><n>"Every person who is great" is in the context of science and research, and science is based on collaboration. So it's unlikely that "a mentor" (A) would inspire "every person". Furthermore, the mentor would still lack the focus and dedication necessary to succeed.<n><n>Option "the crowd" (B) is not supported by the context of the question or the nature of "every person" that is great. While "enlightenment from the crowd" would be plausible, it's unrealistic to think it would inspire the "every person who" to greatness.<n><n>Finally the question seems to have missed an explanation on what "luck plays a big role". The answer choices seem to imply that "luck" (C) doesn't play any role in successfulness in this scenario. Therefore, "the stars" (E) and "the world" (B) both seem to be unlikely. <n><n>So then, answer "the competition" (D) makes sense. It's a reasonable assumption that "every person who is good" is motivated by wanting to be better than everyone else. So by defeating the competition, they become the

Choices:  A: drop out of school B: ask questions C: enter school D: wash dishes E: read book<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>As in any multiple choice question, the task is to analyze and eliminate illogical and inappropriate options, which in this case are "drop out of school" (B) and entering school (D). So, A, B and D are eliminated.<n><n>The remaining questions, C and E, involve the child eating breakfast, being at school, and washing a dish. Option "ask questions" (C) makes sense, as the child wouldn't have dropped out before getting on the bus. While that is a reasonable interpretation, the text doesn't directly state whether the child does, in fact, ask more questions.<n><n>Similarly, option "read a book" (E) doesn't make logical sense, since the child has completed school already. So the correct answer is E.<n><n>Input:The students were preparing a class project when one of them said,"The more the merrier." Choices:  A. This quote originated during the Middle Ages B.

Choices:  A: from the sky B: map C: cross counties by car D: country E: michigan<n>Output:		Reason:A highway is not necessarily a straight line, and you can't view it from the sky. You would need a very good magnifying glass. Also, a county is not necessarily a line. The word 'line' is only mentioned once, but that is the correct one.<n><n>Input: What can a line of people in line be said to do? Choices:  a: be a line b: be able to get there c: get a ride d: be able to get to where you want to go e: be in line<n><n>Output: Reasonable answer would be E: be in line

Choices:  A: raise corn B: seed plants C: grow plants D: seed crops E: farm land<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>Here, farmers want plants that they can make bird feed from and that also use the seed again the next year. This is why they only planted either A: "seed plants" or B: "seed crops." They did not plant any "farm land" or "raised corn" as they had seeds that they would re-use from each seed plant in the following year.<n><n>Option D: "seed crops" is not an appropriate answer as the question asks about "plants," not "crops." Option B: "seed plants" also fits the requirements and is the correct answer.<n>So the final choice is B: "seed plants."<n><n>Input:The boy did not want to go fishing for two hours and was upset when his father forced him to. He would not go fishing for what? Choices: A: three hours B: two hours C: four hours D: eight hours E: one hour<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>In the prompt, it is clear that the boy initially didn't want to go fishing, and is upset by his father forcing him to go. The option A: "three hours," which is the amount of time the father says the boy should stay, is not a valid choice because the boy doesn't want to be there for three hours, and is upset with this requirement. <n><n>The prompt describes this as a "forced" act by the father on the boy - he "forces" the boy to stay there for two hours, which is why their relationship is upset. In addition, the father gives the boy "only two hours" to fish, which would mean that the son doesn't return for "four hours" as per the question.<n><n>Therefore, the only correct answer to this question is "one hour," which is the amount that the father told the boy he could go fishing. He only stayed for one hour, before becoming upset.<n><n>Input:  Choices:  A. Dad, have you ever felt lonely? B. No, Dad, have you? C. No. D. Yes, Dad. E.

Choice A, grocery store, is the most fitting response because it is the most straightforward and common option for potatoes, and it fits in with the story's narrative. Choice C, restaurants, is inappropriate because the context is not about grocery stores but about purchasing food. The others do not fit this context either.<n><n>Output:Reason: the question asks for a way to carry food home, so the most likely scenario is food shopping at a grocery stores.

Choices:  A: football stadium B: apartment C: surface of earth D: car show E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "football stadium" (A) is incorrect because no one lives there. It would be incorrect to consider a place where almost all people live to be almost empty. Option "apartment" (B) is incorrect because most of Earth's surface area is not residential space. This is because of the large areas of water and other uninhabited spaces. Finally, option "car show" (C) is clearly incorrect because cars cannot live.<n><n>As a result, the option "house" (E) is the best choice. It would be the place where most people live, and there would be nowhere near the area that is currently uninhabited<n><n>Input: What does the carpenter's tool do?

Option B "It helps a person get around" (C) is incorrect because this does not describe what a tool does. Option d "It makes a noise and moves thing" (D) is incorrect because although it makes a noise and indeed moves things, it does not help a person.

That would make more sense for someone who just decided to drop their car. Option 2 "His son was driving" (B) is correct. It's common for a father to be very protective of his car after the car has been gifted to his son. Therefore,

Choices:  A: confusion B: complications C: riot D: arrest E: protests<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to identify the context of the question, which is the term "instituting civil action." This term refers to starting civil proceedings, also known as filing a lawsuit.<n><n>The next step is to analyze the choices and determine which one best captures the meaning of the phrase.<n>Option "confusion" (B) implies that "civil action" is somehow confusing or misunderstood, which doesn't make sense in this context - we already know what civil action is and it is the right choice that has been given here. Option "complications" (B) is also not an accurate choice because it implies that the term "civil action" carries some hidden complications that are difficult to understand, which is not true as we have already identified the meaning of "civil action" and confirmed that it refers to filing a lawsuit in civil proceedings.<n><n>The only choice that fits the context is "arrest" (D). The meaning of "instituting civil actions" refers to initiating civil proceedings is to initiate a civil lawsuit. Therefore, the term "arrest" (the process of holding someone in custody) is the best choice in this context.<n><n>Thus, the answer to the question is D: arrest<n><n>Input:  The word `PLAGIARISM` is part of which word type? Choices:  I: A thief II: Troll III: A snake IV: A scandal<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The key to this question lies in understanding the word "type." It suggests there may be more than one type of word, which means we are not looking at individual words but word categories.<n><n>Next, we need to define what type of word a word like "plagiarism" is.<n><n>Option "Troll" (III), is not a word type. It's a word that describes a type of person.<n>Option "scandal" (IV) is a word that can be used to describe a variety of issues, but it is not a type of word.<n><n>That leaves us with two options, "thief" (I) and "snake" (II). The word "type" would suggest that both options are types of words, or categories of words. But which word "type" fits best?<n><n>Option "scandal (IV)" is more

Where would he go to get one? Choices:  A: glass of water B: build evenly C: garage D: carpenter's shop E: video game<n>Output:		Reasoned Explanation:<n><n>Here, Bob needs a level to hang up a shelf, but there isn't a level in his home. The first step is to identify the available options, which include the glass of water (A), build evenly (B), garage (C), carpenter's (D), and video game (E). After this, the next task is to identify the options that don't fit the situation. For example, a "build evenly" (B) only builds a single object, which would be insufficient for hanging a shelf. Then, the task shifts to finding the correct answer. By process of elimination, we can say that only the carpenter's store (C) and the video game (E) don't match the prompt, leaving garage (C) and carpenter's workshop (D) as remaining possibilities. Both of these are places where Bob could go to get a level to hang a picture. Garage (C), in particular, is a location specific to his house where Bob would go to get tools. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Garage<n><n>Input:What are two things that are never ending? Choices: 1. Happiness 2. Pain 3. Time 4. Anger 5. Difficulty<n>Output: Reasonable Explanation:<n>  The first step is to clarify the context and purpose of the question. That includes identifying the items being compared (e.g., "happiness," "pain," "time," etc.) and defining what "never-ending" means within the given scenario. <n><n>By process of elimination, option 3 (Time) is the correct answer. Happiness (1), Pain (2), and Anger (4) are all distinct states that can cease or be interrupted by external factors such as circumstances or people. The same cannot be said of Time (3), which is a dimension and, as such, cannot be "cut to zero" or be otherwise interrupted in a similar way as other options. Time is an essential factor in existence itself, which gives it an unfair advantage over the other options.<n><n>Input: 2nd Grade teacher tells her class to take out a pen.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where in a town would you put your shed? Choices:  A: next to the house B: keeping things in C: backyard D: farm yard E: ranch<n>Output:		Answering the question requires inferring the meaning of contextual words in the description. The term "keeping things in" should be interpreted as a specific type of shed; it provides context as to where the shed is supposed to go. Therefore, the answer is B: backyard.<n><n>Input:What will a chameleon do when it's not hunting? Choices:  B: walk C: hide D: sleep E: be lazy<n>Output: A simple grammatical error disqualifies the answer as factually correct. To say a chameleon will "be lazy" when not hunting implies the chameleon will be lazy more often than when hunting. That would be a logical contradiction. Even if it were to be read as "...when it is not hunting," this answer is still incorrect, as chameleons do not sleep (C) when not hunting (as opposed to resting).<n><n>Input:The newest version of Windows will run on most computers that can run Windows. Choices:  A 1:5 B 3:7 C 5:4 D 2:2.5 E 6:4.5<n>Output: This question asks which is greater; 2 divided by 2.5 and number-a divided by number-b. It's not immediately clear that number-a is "most computers that can run Windows" and number-b is "newest version of Windows." The context is the most important clue as to what the quantities represent.<n>Answering the question requires the understanding that the "newest version of windows" (2) would require the most computers, which would be those that can run windows (5) as opposed to the ones that can't (1). Therefore, the answer to the question is B: 3:7.<n>

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If you're traveling along a highway what item made of paper can you use to find your way?

Choices: A: Look at there eyes B: Ask them C: Take them outside D: Take one of their ears out E: take 10 of their ears out<n>Output: If they're deaf, they don't talk, so they can't tell if a person is speaking to them<n><n>Input: If you add 2 and 2 what is the answer? Choices: 2 A: 6 B: 4 C: 3 D: 5 E: 0<n>Output: If you add 3 and 1 what is the answer? <n>The answer choices were intentionally given wrong, with the exception of the correct one "5". The same principle can be applied to the question as above since you would expect the numbers to add to 5. However, in this case, it would be unwise to reason in the exact same way due to the fact that the answer given is incorrect.<n>Reasoning: <n>The first task is figuring out what kind of answer are being asked for.<n>Is it only binary/boolean? No, since the question is an "if/else".<n>Is it a natural number? No, since natural numbers do not include 0.<n>Is it a fraction? No, since "two" is not a fraction.<n>A real number? No, since real numbers do not include 2 or 0.<n><n>Therefore, the only remaining option is "integer", since the answer should be an integer.<n><n>The next task involves figuring out why the answer is 5. There are two reasons for choosing the correct answer; 1. A real number (integer) has an infinite number of permutations. The only remaining integer in the set is 5 (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0....etc.) 2. The answerer may have chosen "5" based on the fact that "adding" 2 and 2 should give you the answer "5".<n><n><n>Input: If a cat has kittens, and a dog jumps over a fence what is the next thing that will happen?

Choices:  A: school B: large home C: house D: hat rack E: closet<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n><n>Choices C and D (school and hat rack) make sense as one would keep a hat rack in a home and school.  But the choice between B and D is ambiguous, as it is possible they mean different houses: One's "home" and the other's their school house.<n><n>The only possibility that makes sense here is the answer that is different from the other choices. In this case, the answer is Choice A: home, which is not like the other (school) and different from a hat rack.<n><n>But just for kicks, if the writer had said "large" instead of "home," the answer could have been D. This brings in a change in context that could have invalidated the original inference.<n>So the final alternative is A: home<n><n>

Choices:  A: utah B: south america C: new hampshire D: japan E: new mexico<n>Output:		reasoning<n>-<n>If the answer requires to think of a specific country, we should eliminate any options which are not specific countries(like A). A and C are very generic options. They do not narrow in on one specific country.<n><n>Even if there is a location in there, like Australia, it not specific. The question should be more like "I want to go to Australia". If the question requires to answer with a specific country, D is the best choice.<n><n>Reasoning (if the lizard can be any specific type of lizard): If the options have lizards in them, I guess they are generic and we should probably not eliminate then. I will give a better example when I get to the third question. But for now, we should eliminate all non-specific options. Excluding non-specific options we are left with: (B) and (E). E is not a Spanish speaking place, so we should eliminate it. That leaves only South America (B) as the correct answer.<n><n>Answering the question:If I wanted to learn about chess but I am not a genius, should I study the rules and strategies or should I just play a few games?

I might say study the culture, but then again, I am not a chess pro. I will assume that since no specific culture of chess is being referred to that the author is referring to the history of chess. There is a bit of info here that I found that could be relevant, "A 10-page manual on playing chess rules and regulations, first published by the Nizam Mir Muhammad, in 1768, provides the earliest evidence of a manual of chess. The book was translated into English and was called 'The Game of Chess'." From that, it appears to be that the culture is the history of chess, which is the specific answer.<n><n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.

Choices:  A: bathroom B: purse C: drug store D: hand lotion E: water<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First, it is important to determine what the question is asking about. The question suggests that it is asking where one would go to buy a good moistener, which eliminates options such as "bathroom" (A) and "water" (E), as these places would not be used to sell moisturizer.<n><n>The next task it to determine which of the remaining options are the most likely to be correct. Choice C "drugstore" is a common place to buy moisturizers, so it is probably a useful answer. However, choice A "purse" is less likely to be a place people go to buy moistener, so it can be eliminated.<n><n>Choice B "bathroom" is a more obscure place to buy moisturer, however it is still a plausible answer, so it should not be eliminated just yet. Choice E "hand lotion" is another unrealistic answer, but should not be eliminated either, as it is still a possible contender.<n><n>Finally we need to consider choice D "hand lotion" in greater depth.  While this is correct, choice B "the bathroom" is even more plausible, so the answer is B: the bathroom.<n>So the final answers are B: the bathroom<n><n>Input:Where can one find great discounts on makeup? Choices:  The mall  The department store  An old lady’s house  A friend’s collection  Any thrift store<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>First, determine what the question is about. The question suggests it is asking where one could find great discounts, which rules out everything in the question except for the mall and the department store.<n><n>The next step is to compare the answers and eliminate those that are more improbable. The answers "old lady's house" and "any thrift store" are out of the question, because it seems that finding such a bargain would be more likely at the mall or department store rather than at either of these places.<n><n>The last step is to choose the best option. The mall is a common place to look for discounts, while the department store is not so common, so the answer is the mall. So the final answer is The mall (Mall)<n><n>Input:What does the

He has a lot of what? Choices:  A: laughter B: being happy C: glee D: opera E: injuries<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>"Glee" (D) would be the best choice here, since it is the most accurate word to describe the feeling of being happy, joyful, or cheerful. Options such as "being happy" (B) and even "injuries" (E) don't fit as tightly as "glee", because those words aren't as well defined for this context.<n><n>So the final answer would be D: glee<n><n>Input: A girl was staring out the classroom window. She had too many what? Choices: A: worms B: insects C: dogs D: dogs E: fish<n>Output:Reasonung:<n><n>This question is similar to Driving Question above. To find the most accurate choice, pinpoint what the girl is specifically starring. It becomes more precise if you know that the question states "many worms".<n><n>The first few options don't make for an accurate choice, because they don't meet the criteria. For example, "Many insects" is too general to consider, and "Too many dogs" doesn't match the given context.<n>Then, the last choice, "Too many fish" seems to work, but it is a bit inaccurate. The girl is staring out the window and wondering what the fish are doing. Is she trying to count how many fish there are? Or trying to identify what kind of fish they are? There's no way to know. So the best choice is "Too many worms".<n>So the final answer will be A: too many worms<n><n>Input: What is the definition of the phrase I'm trying to describe? Choices: A) In a situation/ context where the other party is trying to do something.  <n>    B) In a situation/context where everyone is being nice and friendly to each other.  <n>    C) When both parties understand each other.  <n>     D) When an employee does the same job or tasks over and over again at work.  <n>     E) When both parties are trying to achieve the same goals. Output:Reasoning:This question can be answered with more than one definition, but the one which can best fit this situation is in option C.<n><n>"In a situation/ context where everyone is being nice to each other" (B) doesn't fit
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results.

Choices:  A: lungs and diaphram B: oxygen C: abdominal muscles D: air E: open throat<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first three options are all irrelevant to the original question, and the final two options are similarly unrelated to a person's daily use of the respiratory system.<n><n>The remaining two options are both closely related and make logical sense. The body draws oxygen from its surroundings via the lungs and diaphragm, which is the most accurate answer to this question.<n>So the correct answer is A: lungs and Diaphragm<n><n>Input: What do the two lines on either side of a football or baseball diamond represent? Choices: <n>A: two lines of the outfield B: home plate and first base<n>C: two end zones D: two stripes E: no stripes F: two base paths<n>Output: Reason Answer:<n><n>The first two options are too broad. Neither "two lines of the outfield" (A) nor "home plate and first base" (B) is a precise description of the boundaries on the field. Similarly, the last option "two base paths" (F) is not a correct choice since a ball can travel in any number of directions as it is hit.<n><n>The most straightforward option, "two stripes" (C), correctly identifies that a baseball diamond has two colored stripes. So the most accurate answer is D: two stripes.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question with the most accurate answer or answer that best fits the context.<n><n>Input: Who do the following people represent in the federal government?<n><n>a.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is a lion likely to live? Choices:  A: veldt B: ocean C: savannah D: africa E: jungle<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option "lion" and "vellat" are synonymous and are thus not likely to be part of a multiple choice question.<n>Likewise, with "Africa," since it is the continent in which a large majority of lions live - as well as the home to "savannah" - its option wouldn't likely be part of a multiple-choice question.<n><n>This leaves us with "Savannah" (C) and "jungle" (E), which are two environments that a lion is likely to live in. Jungles may be described as "savannahs" found within forests or woodlands.<n><n>Therefore, the correct choice would be C: savannah<n><n>Input: Are all human beings mammals? Choices:  a: yes b: false/no c: yes d: no e: false/no<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Option "false" is clearly incorrect.<n><n>Option "no" is incorrect because humans are in fact mammals, so this would mean "no, all human beings are not mammals" wouldn't make logical sense.<n><n>Option "yes" is incorrect because this would make logical sense in a multiple choice question<n><n>Of the remaining answers, "yes" and "no," option no would imply that "no, all human being are not mammals," which again doesn't make logical sense, and "yes" doesn't make sense in an inverse manner.<n><n>We are thus left with only option E. The correct answer to the question is A: yes. Option c will never be correct.<n><n>Input: When was the atomic bomb first used? Choices: a: 1945 b: 1944 c: 1946<n>Output:Reason<n><n>The year 1945 is the correct answer to the question "When was the atomic bomb first launched?" because a bomb was actually detonated in Japan that year. Option A is incorrect.<n><n>Option C is incorrect because 1944 precedes 1946.<n><n>The year that actually fits the question is "1945," and that's the only option to which is an exact fit.<n><n>Input: In 1984, will computers have the intelligence of which of their human inventors
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Everybody raised a drink and cheered, they were doing what? Choices:  A: were thirsty B: toasting C: getting drunk D: refreshment E: celebrating<n>Output:		Reason: A is a possibility but it is vague<n><n>The first task here is to interpret the meaning of "toasted" which is the closest option. The next task is to identify the subject of the situation - "everyone".<n><n>Since the action is collectively performed by other people, the only logical thing that can be the subject who is 'doing a certain act or activity' is 'toast'. The last task is to identify what that activity is.<n><n>So, from the options available:<n>Every everyone raised a drink and [toasted](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/toast). The activity should be to raise a drink and cheers. But the next sentence clearly tells that the drink is being raised as a toast. <n><n>So option A is correct because it is the only which fits the context and purpose of question.<n><n>Input : The kids went on their own holiday last week, and they were able to have a great time because they were all what? Choices: A: adventurous B: curious C: hungry D: scared E: smart<n>Output: Reason : Since the kids had a great time. They should be brave and adventurous. Not hungry, scared and not smart as all of these qualities are not helpful there.<n><n>So the first task is to interpret the first sentence. It is obvious that these kids had to have gone somewhere and they had a great time from the second sentence, which implies that this great time had to be their holiday.<n><n>Next task is to identify the holiday purpose of kids.<n><n>The next task comes is about what purpose, and which of the qualities can make their holiday more successful.<n><n>Since they had fun in their holiday, their should be braver and adventurous, and not something different (A, B, C). Since they need bravery and adventurous, they should be smart (E)<n><n>So the final answer will be E: Smart<n><n>Input: The kids went on a school camping trip the day after the first day of school, and they had fun exploring an old abandoned mine near camp.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:John is getting something important.  What does this make him feel? Choices:  A: then have B: headaches C: stoic D: being happy E: wanting more<n>Output:		Reason: John feels a feeling of happiness.<n><n>First, we need to identify the type of thing John is getting, which is determined by the context of the sentence. The context implies that something good and significant is about to happen to John. Therefore (D) is an unlikely option because it seems unrelated the context provided by the sentence.<n><n>The feeling is related to getting something, and to the significance of getting it. But the sentence doesn’t provide any more details. We can rule out the option A: then have (C) by thinking of what else John might do to get whatever it is he is going to get.<n><n>If John were to receive something important or significant, we can reasonably assume that he would feel some emotion other than "headaches" (B) — that being a strange choice and not likely to be a normal feeling for someone receiving some big news.<n>Finally, John could feel happiness when he gets something important. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) "feeling happy."<n><n>---<n><n>### Instruction: What is the difference between 100 and 103?

Choices:  A: advertisement B: magazine C: store D: web page E: bus<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question is ambiguous, referring to an "advertisement" without explicitly stating which product or service is being advertised.<n><n>The options "bus" (D) and "magazine" (B) would be valid answers if the word "advertisement was swapped for "advertisement about a bus." <n><n>Option "the store" (C) would be valid if the advertisement were for a specific product, such as a new line of soaps from a particular store.<n><n>Option "web page" (E) would also be valid if the advertisation was for a web page or website.<n><n>As for the choices that don't correspond with the question, A, B, and D all refer to specific advertisements, which don't relate to what is being advertised or where advertising generally occurs. The question specifies that the job is "dancing and waving an ad," so the advertisement itself must be what the person is dancing and waving.<n><n>Therefore, the options that would fit the context are: magazine, web page, or advertisement, in descending order of likeliness.<n><n>But the keyword here is "outside." If the advertising is on the street or even in the parking lot, we rule out options "Bus" and "magazine." Option (B) would be correct if the advertising were inside the store itself.<n><n>So the final answer would be for magazine, B: magazine and the correct answer would be an option B: magazine<n><n><n>Input:How did the person who didn’t know how to ride a bike learned how to pedal a bicycle?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where does someone lay with their leg elevated when it's broken? Choices:  A: spinning wheel B: on a ladder C: hospital bed D: legroom E: grand piano<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first portion of this question provides a clue to help eliminate 3 potential choices (C, D, and E). Why would someone put their leg up on a hospital bed, ladder, or piano?<n><n>Option choice "spinning wheel" (A) has a logical sounding context: it's a logical answer to a question about where to place your broken leg. But spinning wheels, although useful for spinning threads of yarn, are not commonly used as beds.<n><n>Options choices "hospital bed" (C) and "legroom" (D) also seem logical at first glance, because the word "hospital" and "legroom" suggest that they could potentially be used to put your legs up. However, these are only partial meanings of the terms - they're only one aspect of the complete meaning.<n><n>Hospital beds are typically used to care for someone who is sick or injured, with the bed positioned in a position where the patient can be cared for easily.<n><n>In the context of a single person in a hospital with one broken leg, hospital beds would not be used to elevate their leg for healing.<n><n>Legroom is technically an appropriate answer to the question - the name "legroom" implies that it refers to a place in which you can put your legs. However, this is typically something that applies to planes, where you can put your legs up in the gap between seats. (This is especially true when sitting in the exit row or in the emergency row.)<n><n>Option "grand piano" (E) is even further off the mark. Grand pianos are the largest type of piano, with a massive frame and large keys. In other words, grand pianos are large and heavy. It's not that they would not work to support the broken leg of a single individual, but it's not an intuitively obvious answer choice.<n><n>The correct answer choice is option "spinning wheel." It would make an unusual, but not totally ridiculous answer to a question asking where someone should put their broken leg. And so the correct answer is spinning wheel.

Choices:  A: boot B: the desert C: loaf of bread D: foot E: hock<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in solving this logic problem is to identify the types of entities involved in the question. In this case, the question refers to different types of food, which can either be "boots," "deserts," or "loaves of bread." Each of these entities are defined by their shape, and their common goal is to contain something. This information can help narrow down the answer choices.<n><n>The question can also be helpful in identifying possible incorrect answers. For example, the answer "hocks" is incorrect because it refers to a person's foot. Looking at the other incorrect choices, however, a more appropriate answer would be "bread" because all of the other entities are food, while "hocks" is not.<n><n>When considering the other answer options, it is important to remember the context of the question and to focus on the entity's purpose. For example, boots are a type of shoe that protect the feet. Therefore, the answer option of "boot" is incorrect. Similarly, "deserts" are a part of the Earth's surface, and "loaves of bread" are a type of food. In contrast, "bread" is a food item, so it is the correct answer.<n>By considering the entity's purpose, the goal of containing something, and remembering the context of the question, the correct answer of "bread" can be determined.<n>So the final choice is BREAD

Choices:  A: shelf B: desktop C: cabinet D: kitchen E: cupboard<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This is a tricky question because the answer is not directly provided, so you must follow up with further questions if you don’t know the answer. Based on the context, we can determine this is a kitchen related question, and what might that mean?<n><n>The answer to “What do you call a kitchen in France?”, is “Cuisine”, and “Cabinet” translates to “Cabinet” (C). Cuisine is definitely not a drying place, so neither is cabinet. Kitchen is obviously a place where you can dry a coffee mug, so the answer is B.<n><n>The problem with this question is that you need to have knowledge of French cuisine to be able to answer it correctly. While this is rare, you should be open to the possibility that knowledge of foreign languages and/or other foreign concepts could be beneficial in some of the future questions.<n><n>Input: Who can I complain to about this?

Why is this happening?<n><n>Let's figure out why this situation has happened - you know there is manager, but don't know his name. We're given clues that there is "T", and "manager", so they must be related. The T-word must be related to manager. Let's remove all other choices from the options and find the related words T and manager by using the process of elimination. We eliminate them all one by one. The choice of "the chef" could only be used (if it belongs to the right category) if "Chef" could also be said to be related to "manager". This is not the case so the choice of (D) is incorrect. If the related word is "M" then "Manager" can be made to end with "M". None of the other choices contain M, therefore, "M" must not be related to manager. That means choice (C) must be the correct one.<n><n>This question is a little bit more abstract and requires some critical thinking to solve. You should use whatever means necessary to solve this question. If you remember nothing else

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:John is a human who is in a wheelchair due to an accident.

Choices:  A: front door B: newspaper C: post office D: package E: mail box<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first word is "might", which implies that it is only possible, not certain. Also, the first word is modified by the phrase "find theirs," which points to the person who might find their own doorway open.<n><n>Therefore, the letter was not stolen from one's home.<n><n>Input: I don't really care about what's going on behind the red door because the blue door is closed. Choices: ↗ A: the blue door B: the red door C: both doors D: neither door E: neither door<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The question is, "What's going on behind" some door? Therefore, the "behind" phrase is emphasized; we care only what lies behind the red door, or behind both doors. So what's going on with the blue door is not the primary concern.<n><n>Option "the blue door" (A) is incorrect, because, despite the context of the question, it might be reasonable to expect an answer that includes some reference to "the red door," rather than just saying either the blue door or the red door.<n><n>"The blue door" (B) is also incorrect for the same reason that option "the red door" (A) was incorrect; one should expect an answer that includes "the red door" also.<n><n>Therefore the answer is C:  Both doors<n><n>Input: They both were so sick and tired of their wives bickering that they were planning to get away for three months or more. Choices: 1: ↗ more than a month <n>2: ↗ years 3: ↗ one week 4: ↗ a few months 5: ↗ less than a year<n> Output: Reason<n>So the husband and wife get divorced due to their disagreements, however this doesn't imply that they're planning to get divorced.

Choices:  A: school building B: skyscraper C: business D: grocery store. E: work<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>So in this question the choices are to a place. So we are looking for a place where there are are a lot of offices so it is a workplace. The choice options are D: grocery Store, B: skyscrappers and a business, C: schools and work. So the answer is C) Business so the answer is C) a business and not a grocery store!<n><n>Input: How many letters are in the word BETRAYAL? Choices:  B) Two C) Three D) Four E) Five<n>Output: Reason: The first word has 5 letters  (B), the second has 4  (D), the third has 3 (C) and the fourth has zero (E). The remaining letters of (D) is 1. The shortest word is "B", the second is "CA" with 2 letters. As for the word E is not a word (E). So "BACA" is the answer!<n><n>Input: Where are the cheetahs at their fastest speed? Choices:  D) Zoo A: Safari Park E: Farm <n>Output: The answer is D) Zoo!

Choices:  A: think B: patent C: determined D: work hard E: relax<n>Output:		Reason:<n>After all his hard work and sleepless nights, the scientist is about to achieve his ultimate goal: bringing his idea to reality. While he may have done everything he could to make that happen, this is still something much greater than what he could have hoped for. <n>Option B (think) is incorrect, because there is no hint that the scientist contemplating or thinking about his idea. His decision has already been made. <n><n>Option C (determined) could be a possibility, as the scientist may have thought about giving up in the past. But the end goal of this process isn't about making him stronger, it's about making his idea reality. <n><n>Option D (work hard) is too simplistic to be the correct answer. "Working hard" does not imply that the scientist was always determined to make his idea a reality. <n><n>"Relax" (E) - This is clearly not an appropriate choice, as the scientist is about the be successful in his goal, and relaxation would not be part of that. Plus, it would be impossible to relax during this entire process.<n>So the correct answer is E: relax<n><n>Input: How much money the scientist have made if he were to patent the idea? Choices:  a: 9000000 b: 100000<n>Output: Reason<n><n>It's important to understand the wording of the question, which is asking about money the scientist would make if he were to pat his idea. The correct choice, then, is B (One million). The scientist doesn't need to actually make that amount of money- just the possibility of it motivates him.<n><n>Input: If the scientist was a successful surgeon he would have which skill? Choices: A) Communication B) Deciphering<n>C) Planning D) Leadership E) Organization<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Option A (communication) is incorrect, as a successful surgeon may have good communication skills but not be a good communicator in this situation. The same holds true for options B (perception) and C (planning). <n><n>Option D ("leadership") is also incorrect, as being a leader is not the same as possessing leadership skills. A person may have strong leadership skill, but

Choices:  A: lot of grief B: depression C: no spouse D: lose money E: children suffer<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Since this is a multiple choice question, the logic to evaluate whether an answer is reasonable or not is pretty simple: rule out all the questions that are irrelevant or unreasonable first. <n><n>In this case, the only option that can be eliminated from the start is "lot of grief" (B). It's important to note that this option is grammatically incorrect since it's meant to describe the spouse as the recipient of the grief, thus making "lot" the subject.<n><n>The next obvious question to ask is "What is a negative effect of divorce?" In this case, the only reasonable answer would be "depression" (C). This is the most logical choice of answers, and fits the context of the question well.<n><n><n>### Input:In which year did the 2015-2016 school year begin? Choices: 1978 A: 1 2: 2000 B: 5 C: 2022 D: 673 E: 47902<n>Output: Reason<n><n><n>The best way to start this question is to separate the logical choices from the illogical ones. One way to do this is to identify each number and see if it belongs to a sequence. 1 is already invalidated due to being impossible (since 1978 < 2015). Choices A and 2 belong to a sequence, so they are both eliminated. <n><n>Since 2 does not follow a sequence, the next step is to identify any other numbers that fail to follow a sequence as well. We can easily eliminate choices E and F, as they do not follow any obvious sequence.<n><n>Choices B and D can both be evaluated for whether or not they follow a sequence, since B + 6 and C - 9 both can be calculated. For B, the answer is 2,022, indicating the year is not logical. Similarly, for D, the answer is 47,902, also ruling that choice out. <n><n>The only left logical choices are C and D. Since 2022 (C) < 673 (D), the correct answer is either B (2000) or D (673). We thus arrive at B (2002).<n>So

He loved the idea of going to mars, and reads books about it all the time.   He dreams of being on what? Choices:  A: love B: zoo C: school D: space shuttle E: library<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>As soon as the context of the question has been established ("James [is] interested in…"), we can eliminate any options (B and C) that describe James as an individual, thus eliminating "zoo" (B) and the "school" (C). Now, we can make a case that James might "dream of being on" the space shuttle, but the context also suggests that he prefers the red planet to any other, so this would be an unlikely scenario. This leaves us with the option "library".<n><n>It's possible that this answer is supposed to describe Mars as a location, but in that case, the "c" in the question should be capitalized to identify it as a place (as in, the "school" location). <n><n>As it turns out, the question is asking about James's preference, in which case "library" is the correct word choice, because libraries exist here on Earth and books are usually found there.<n><n><n><n>Input: You should never lend cash money to family. Choices:  A B  C  D E<n>Output: Reason<n><n>In this case, we have to consider all parts of the sentence. "You should never lend c ash money to family" is in a passive voice (e.g. "cash money is lended"), which means that something other than the family is the actor, which could be the reason. We can eliminate options A (lended) and C (lending). Then we need to parse the sentence into two units: "You should..." and "never lend cash money..." This places the first unit in a subordinating position as a causal conjunction ("should") and the second unit in a subordinated position, which is the main verb (lend). The first unit, then, is a clause. The second unit is a main clause, which means that the remaining main verbs are A, B, D, and E.<n><n>As we compare each option to this rule, we can eliminate option C (main clause and the main verb can be neither in the sentence). We can also eliminate option D (main verb requires a noun; there is none in the original sentence), and option E (main verb must be inflected; it is present in the original sentence.) The remaining options are B, which is the only choice that fits the rule.<n>

He searched and found a large menu of what? Choices:  A: advertisement B: news C: bar D: cafe E: internet sites<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This one has multiple context and inference errors. 1: The only "large menu" available in this situation is a menu of digital currencies, as suggested by item B. The options C and D suggest cafe and bar, which makes little sense. Neither of those things have anything to do with looking for "large menus." Item E has the most appropriate context of the set: the internet does have many options when it comes to trading digital currency.  Item A is a type of advertisement but doesn't have anything to do with the scenario presented. Finally, item A is a type of news, which gives it a sense of context with this situation, though it's the incorrect answer. There is no news advertisement in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Choices:  A: back pocket B: meeting C: drug store D: home E: school<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To answer this question, let’s first look at what we know about the context:<n>- It is unlikely for someone to store a notepad in a pocket (back, front, or otherwise; we’re not being specific).<n>- The question suggests this person is keeping a few sheets or a stack with writing on it and that it is small enough to carry around.<n>- The question asks us where they can be stored, which means they are easily moved around, as opposed to kept in place (like shades are kept on a person).<n>- The only reasonable placement is on the person as they walk around.<n>- Since the item is small enough to carry and there is no reason the context does not allow for carrying it, the most likely answer is “on your person” as the person literally walks around with the notepad. <n>- The question doesn’t make sense if it is a large and stationary one, or it would be obvious that it is to be kept in a home or an office. But a notepad/b00ker is portable and can fit anywhere on you.<n><n>The most logical answer is choice C. In short, option C doesn't make any sense. The question doesn't make sense if it's a large and stationary notepad.<n><n><n><n>Input: What fruit contains the most sugar? Choices: <n> <n>A: Lemon<n>B: Grapefruit<n>C: Watermelon<n>D: Apple <n>Output: Reason<n><n>To answer this, we immediately disregard any fruit that contains no sugar. In that sense, apple does NOT contain sugar, hence we can eliminate choice D.<n><n>We then eliminate fruit that contain very little sugar because of the way the question stated "contains the most sugar." An obvious counterargument to this rule is that in some extreme cases, it is possible that one fruit could contain the most sugar and another not even contain any. But, this is not likely when we're asked about "the most."<n><n>So of the remaining option, we can disregard citrus fruits, grapefruit and lemon because they taste too tart for many people. For that reason, option C is also eliminated.<n><n>Watermelon can taste very sweet, so it is plausible. Watermelon is made up of 92

Most articles would only express a local, small event.<n>Option C: worrie: This is a misspelling "worried" is not a word which means anxious or apprehensive and not similar to a worry. Also, this option was written "conern", not concern, but also not worrie. This does not seem to mean anything and may be unintentional.

Choices:  A: erections B: entertainment C: boredom D: get fat E: sadness<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Nothing else to do? Really?<n><n>Options "erections" (A) and "get fat" (C) are out of the running almost immediately. They directly conflict with the scenario and would result in an unhappy ending. Further, option "get fat" (A) is too much information about what to expect;  such a detail would most likely occur because the viewer was watching tv for too long than just a few minutes, or if they ate lots of sweets during the show.<n><n>Option "sadness" (E) would be an accurate answer, if not for a small caveat: it does not describe the outcome the viewer expects specifically from watching tv.<n><n>Options (C) and (D), while not contradictory to the scenario, are not exactly what can be expected after watching tv. Viewing a tv show is not the same as "being bored" or "nothing else to do", which would indicate that there were no other entertainment options available, or that the viewer was simply trying to avoid something. Thus, options (C) and (E) are out of the question, and the answer to the question is D: be entertained<n>

Choices:  A: classroom B: synagogue C: bathroom D: front porch E: grocery store<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The question contains the clue "front porch" (D), which gives clues to where the morning paper would be delivered in the house. Choice (A) is not the answer because it does not match the clue given in the question which is a synagogue. (B) is a church, which is the opposite of "synagogue." The clue from the question leads us to eliminate choice (B) out of the picture. Now the options are (D), (C), and (E). The definition of the word "bathroom" is "a room or a building designed for people to clean themselves." Thus, answer (C) is wrong and it is removed out from the final options which are reduced to (D) and (E).<n><n>To identify the right answer, we should study the meaning of the word “paper," which means “a material that is made from plant pulp, has parts turned on one side, and is used to write and print with.”<n>Now we can easily conclude that choice (D) is "a front porch" which is incorrect since a front porch (D) has nothing to do with paper making and distribution.<n>The last choice remains is (E) which is "a grocery store."<n>This conclusion is the final or correct answer for this question

Choices:  A: rock band B: sea of japan C: sushi restaurant D: fish market E: atlantic ocean<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>Let's look at each choice individually.<n><n>* "Rock band": This choice makes no sense, given that it's unlikely that a blowfish would be found in a music venue. There's no context provided for "rock band" as it relates to the given scenario, so it's hard to tell if it's even a viable option at all.<n><n>* "Sea of Japan": This choice doesn't make sense, since the sea of japan is a body of water located in Asia, far away from the Carolina's and the blowfish.<n><n>* "Sushi restaurant": Again, this choice doesn't make much sense given that sushi restaurants are likely to be found in major cities and populated areas, not off of coasts or by the ocean. Also, sushi is made from fish, not blowfish.<n><n>So now, let's look at the remaining choices.<n><n>* "Fish market": This choice makes sense in the context of the given scenario, as the blowfish was likely to have been found in a fish market, which is common in areas that have frequent seafood sales and trade.<n><n>* "Atlantic Ocean": Similarly, this choice makes sense in the given context, as the blowfish would have likely been found in the Atlantic Ocean, which encompasses the entire coast of the Carolina'<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What area is likely to contain a large village? Choices:  A: rural area B: big city C: suburbs D: ohio E: countryside<n>Output:		Reason: The question asks us to determine where a large village may be located, and we can infer the answer by context clues. When we think of a large village, it is likely to be found in a rural area where the people are isolated and far removed from the bustle of a big city.<n><n>In addition, the answer "Ohio" (E) seems like a silly answer for a variety of reasons. First, it is not a country and therefore, it makes no sense to use that term to describe a large village. Secondly, it appears to be in the middle of the United States and would not be considered to be a typical rural area.<n><n>Furthermore, the answer "suburbs" (C) seems to fit the question at hand, so it can be eliminated. This answer suggests that a village would be located near the countryside, which makes sense given the context clues provided.<n><n>The answer "big city" (B) seems logical as well, as the term "big city" typically implies the presence of a large population, which could make the village a part of the city. However, this answer has been ruled out due to its inconsistency with the context clues.<n><n>Finally the remaining answer is "countryside" (D). This answer makes the most sense given the context cluses. It is logical to think that a village with many residents would be found in a rural or countryside area, far from the busy streets of a big city. Based upon these reasons, the most appropriate answer to the question is D: countryside.<n><n>Input: What is the capital of France?

He was a clown, and acted very ridiculous.  This cheerfulness turned off people who expected the funeral to be what? Choices:  A: solemn B: compete C: serious D: somber E: straightforward<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again the first task is to identify the objective of the clown Shane, who is attending his father's funeral.<n>Option C, "serious", eliminates itself because the funeral is inappropriate a place for a serious event. So we can eliminate C, but let's keep A, B, D and E.<n><n>The second task is to identify the correct level of solemnity. A and D clearly don't fit because they're excessively saddening. So we can eliminate A and D. Next, we have to identify whether the somberness of the funeral is too high. There's a tug of war between A and B. A is too low, but B seems to be a little too high.<n><n>The answer here, A, is a little low, so the correct answer here would be B: compete<n>Input: The king was in need of a new weapon.<n>He was a strong, capable, and fearless warrior.<n><n>The king, however, was a little clumsy - he dropped his new weapon. A dragon swooped down and ate it.<n><n>However, the weapon's ability to withstand fire - even from the dragon's breath - had been its most prized ability. As the dragon consumed it, the king realized that he had wasted his one opportunity to defeat the dragon.<n><n>The weapon could be summoned again, and the king was eager to try once more.<n><n>The dragon was sitting on the king's hand when they realized each other.<n>What did the king do? Choices:<n>  A: B: C: D: E:<n>Output: Reason<n><n>There are two parts in this input, the first is the statement where it says "The king was in need of weapon". At first, you have to identify what the actual purpose is the king in need of the weapon. The answer is, "The king was in a need for defending against dragon", which is B.<n><n>The second part is the following, it says the king was having a little clumsy and dropped the weapon, so he was just in need to do whatever he can to defend his weapon.<n>And I will tell you guys, the answer for this part is A.<n><n>So the final answer for this question is A.<n>

Choices:  A: rain forest B: research laboratory C: cage D: treetops E: south africa<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>When a monkey is removed from its natural environment to become an "animal test subject", the monkey's quality of life is significantly reduced. <n><n>However, the laboratory may appear quite different than the actual habitat the monkey was taken from. For example, the monkey may be raised in a cage, rather than having the opportunity to experience open spaces, sunshine, and other natural stimuli. <n><n>It's important for the monkey subject to have some degree of normalcy, so keeping the space similar to the monkey's original environment would ideally be the best course of action.<n><n>Furthermore, humans are generally thought to have a better grasp on their own interests than the monkeys, so one could argue that human preference is to be given priority in the environment design.<n><n>So the final answer would be D: treetops, because this environment fits the context of the question as well as the monkey's ideal needs.<n><n>Input: What is this famous bridge crossing the River Thames? Choices:  Ponte Vecchio The Tower Bridge Big Ben The Leam Bridge Clifton Cathedral<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The best response would be "Big Ben" (Option B). "Big Ben" is arguably the most widely famous landmark on a worldwide scale as it is one of London's most recognizable symbols.<n><n>"Ponte Vecchio" (Option A) is a bridge in Italy, and is known for two specific reasons: its construction of medieval architecture and its position at the end of the Arno River. It does not seem to be a popular bridge in modern days due to its age and style, so this would not be the answer to the question. <n><n>"The Tower Bridge" (Option D) is a historical landmark and a major tourist attraction. However, it is very well-known on a global scale and is a symbol of London, as it is positioned in the central Thames River area.<n><n>"The Leam Bridge" (Option E) is a 140-year-old bridge constructed in 1864 over the River Leam. <n><n>"Clifton Cathedral" (Option C) is not a bridge at all, nor is it a well-known symbol or landmark. It is a Catholic Church in Bristol, England.<n>

Choices:  A: book B: meeting C: television D: guide E: newspaper<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question seems to suggest people are using books as their primary source of information about the world around them. While books are a common way to educate oneself about various topics and events, they are not generally used as a source of information regarding one's immediate environment.<n><n>In contrast, television and guides are mentioned as potential sources, which fits more naturally with the context. Choice B (Meeting) seems like an unwarranted alternative, as a meeting does not typically provide information about the world at large, but rather, is confined to specific conversations or interactions with those who are present.<n><n>However, the choice E (newspaper) seems to provide conflicting information. While newspapers do contain information about local events and issues, they are more likely to provide news and commentary in regard to events occurring beyond the reader's immediate environment.

Choices:  A: bushes B: dessert C: books D: heat lamps E: rocks<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this scenario, the most likely option for lizards is a heat lamp, since that would regulate body temperature in the same way that sunlight does. This is also the only option that's a "real" choice. "Bushes" and "books" don't make logical sense since lizards wouldn't need books to regulate their body temp and "bushes" could cause them to get lost or confuse them. "Dessert" doesn't make much sense since they wouldn't need deserts to regulate body temperature: a desert's hot and lizards would not spend time in the desert except in the summer, so "desserts" and lizards do not make sense. And "rocks" are also a bad idea: lizards need their heat lamps to regulate their body temperatures, and rocks could cause accidental burns and won't regulate heat temperature and wouldn't make sense.<n>"<n><n>#### ## Sub-question:<n><n>In the question above, we noticed that lizards were given the option for "the sun's heat", instead of a sun, since it did not make sense for them to sit on a "sun".

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:George ruined the surprise.  How did he do so? Choices:  A: hiding B: accidentally C: expectation D: knowingly E: planned<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to note about this question is that several of the answer choices are ambiguous in context and therefore are irrelevant for this question.<n><n>"Hiding" (B) and accidentally" (C) aren't options, since the sentence mentions that George was blamed for ruining the surprise: "George ruined the show and blamed it on an accident."<n><n>Further, it would be unlikely for George to knowingly or intentionally ruin the surprise. While he may have planned to do so, he would instead choose this plan if it were a more likely outcome of his actions, as "planned" (E) is a type of action that would be taken before the event.<n><n>This leaves "knowingly" (D) as the most plausible answer. Since the phrase was used in the sentence, George must have been aware of his actions and the impact they would have. Therefore, knowing about his actions and his intentions are both necessary for him to ruin the surprise.<n>Thus, option "knowingly" would be the most likely outcome of this scenario.<n>So the answer for this question is D: knowingly<n><n>Input:The number of people with access to the network was shrinking.  Which of the following is the most likely result of this change? Choices:  a: fewer people will be on the network b: more people will become addicted to the network c: There is a problem with the network. d: A user's Internet will take longer to set up. e: all of the above are plausible outcomes<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>In this case, some of the answer choices are implausible or don't fit with the given context, including option "A user's Internet will be take longer to set up" (E). This means that the only correct option is "there is a problem with the Internet" (D).<n><n>Input:What is the main theme of this essay?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do fish spend the majority of their time? Choices:  A: body of water B: lake superior C: underwater D: toilet E: aquarium<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question is a trick because the key is to understand the question as: "where do fish spend most of their time?”<n>The answer must be "underwater" (D). <n><n>The option that is a synonym of "underwater" would be "toilet"? (E). But using option (E). does NOT make any logical sense. Because it is unnatural for us to think of fish as spending time in a toilet underwater.<n><n>The next options that are synonyms are "body of water" (B) and “lake superior” (C). But using option (B) is inaccurate because the underlined portion of the question indicates the majority of the fish has time not the majority of the water. Also, using option (C) is redundant because by using the word lake superior it already implies that it's under water.<n><n>So the final answer would be D: underwater.<n>

Choices:  A: wait for B: eat out C: entertain D: please parents E: paint<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In the English language, we use idioms for the purpose of speed and efficiency when speaking with those we know well. Here is an example of an idiom:<n><n>"I hate Mondays."   <n>--> What it means: To hate working on Monday.<n>But what she is actually saying is:<n>"I hate to work on Mondays."<n>This kind of phrasing is done in English because it is more common. This way, we can shorten the wording and we aren't repeating the word "to" every time.<n>So here, she likes to host on Fridays and she hates Mondays, which means she is inviting her friends to her house to entertain them. So finally, the final answer is E.<n><n>Input: A: A man was walking along the road who saw a car stuck in the mud. What did he say to it as he passed it? Choices:  Cars don't come out of the mud!<n><n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The choice "don't come out of mud"(C) is plausible. But the correct choice is "Get out of the mud you stupid thing"(B).<n>The choice "you stupid thing"(B) doesn't quite match the rules of the idiom. Although this phrase is commonly used in English conversations, it might feel slightly odd using it.<n>Input: A: She had trouble sleeping last night but when I asked why?

Choices:  A: french government B: friend's house C: zoo D: south africa E: madagascar<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer is D, South Africa.<n><n>The question is clearly worded, but the word waived is misleading. It doesn't mean the monkey is going to work in South Africa. Rather, the monkey might be trying to work with South Africa. A closer look at the two choices, B and C, leads to the realization that the monkey is working for a circus, which is a place of employment.<n><n>The clue that points to South Africa comes from the word'surrender'. From the question, you know that only the monkey was surrendering, and not any of the other circus employees. This indicates the circus is working in or visiting South Africa. A little research online can confirm that many touring circuses travel to South Africa.<n><n>Answer:D: South Africa<n><n>---<n><n>#### 빠른 출처: <n>[데이터 사이언스 해설 MCQ - 정답을 기억하는 길](https://yunbom.tistory.com/28)<n><n>---<n><n># Question 2:<n><n>1.

Choices: <n>A: she had to take food to the patient B: she thought it was rude to decline C: in case the patient's hunger was a sign of an underlying problem D: the standard response E: the patient could not speak for herself<n>Outputs: Reasons:<n><n>The nurse's statement is not unacceptable under question A, but it is an irrelevant reply. Although she could take food to the patient, she is not obligated, and taking food is not necessary to make the patient feel less alone. Question A is about how she felt, not what she did. She answered more about what she did than how she felt.<n><n>The answer is wrong under question D. It is true that a patient who cannot speak for herself requires a nurse to be the patient's advocate.

It can also refer to “freeway” (E) but that is not true either. Option “telephone network” (C) does not mean much to us, either.<n>The phrase “telephone network” is very much outdated in today’s world. It may also refer to “frequency control” (F) in this case.<n>Then comes the “frequency control” option which refers to a system to control electrical equipment, which is wrong.<n>The final option would be “wires” (E).<n>So option E: wires would be the correct answer<n><n>Input: If your friend has something on his mind, tell him what?

In this case, the question is clearly asking about physical distances between two points, and not a complex mathematical calculation.<n><n>The options can be quickly eliminated based on their lack of relevance. 1, 2 and 7 are wrong, because those distances aren't relevant to a physical distance. The others range from 0.6 to 64, but those are the distances between kilometers and other units of measurement, not a kilometer to another kilometer. This narrows the options down to 3, 4, 5 and 6.<n><n>4 is closer to 64 than to 3.3, so we can eliminate options that aren't closest to their target. 4 and 5 are close enough that the two options should be tested in equal portions. Of the two, 4 is closer to 8 miles than 64, so 4 is the correct answer.<n><n>Reason: If you're unable to figure out the answer because you're unsure which units are being referred to, you could ask for clarification from whomever's asking you the question, or just try to reverse the units of measurement to make sense of the problem.<n><n>##### Note:<n><n>-A: You should read a list of options carefully and look for clues as to what each option means before you select one.<n><n>-B: There are many correct option in this question.<n><n>-C: You must pick up on the context of a question in order to pick the correct option.<n><n>-D: The correct option is the one that the writer intended to convey, <n><n>-E: You should understand the context of a question before select any option.<n><n>-F: You should pick an option that fits the context and the information

Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question is essentially asking where the term "motorway" came from, which refers to the common term for a highway in England. The only country that uses this term is England, and therefore the answer is E: england<n><n><n>Input: Where do they speak french? Choices: <n><n>A: england  B: switzerland  C: nigeria  D: japan  E: india<n>Output: Reason<n><n>There are many countries where French is spoken as a native language, including countries in Europe and Africa. The answers that should be discarded are those that aren't countries (A), and aren't associated with French (B) and (C, which do include countries that speak French). This leaves us with the question of which country speaks French. The answer is E: India.<n>It doesn't necessarily have to make sense as the question asks for "WHERE" in response, not necessarily the "HOW many"<n><n>The question is simply asking which European country is the biggest. The choice "England" doesn't make any sense as the answer, since England technically isn't a country. Therefore, the answer would be England.<n><n>The question asks you to write the country of the capital city. This implies that the country name won't necessarily start with the capital city's name, since there may be a lot of capital cities, not just countries. In addition, the question doesn't give information on the population or area of the capital city, which would be useful if they were explicitly given as an option. Therefore, the answer is France.<n><n>The answer has very little to do with the size of the countries or populations. Based on the context, it's clear that the countries are in Europe, and the capital city must by in Europe as well.<n><n>## Explanation: (2) <n>The question asks "in which European country is capital city Frankfurt?" which means that Germany is not the correct answer. <n><n>It can be answered by noting that the countries of Europe are located in the continent of Europe.<n><n>## Reasoning: (1)<n><n>The questions asks if there is a type of bicycle that does not fit this category. By saying "not x", we are simply eliminating these candidates.<n><n>## Reasons:<n><n>In order to answer the question, it is necessary
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:How might compassionate thoughful be described as being? Choices:  A: disengenious B: human C: weird D: kind E: stupid<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, the word "thougful" is the key part. The sentence "compassionate and thoughtful" suggests that a person can be compassionate and thought about.<n>The options that do not contain "thougful" would be eliminated and "stupid" would be chosen.<n><n>Input: Which of the following can you not say about the following letter? Choices:  (C)  (C)  A) B) C) D)<n>Output: Reason:(https://prnt.sc/sQmKxOc7U_Lq)<n><n>First thing to do is to know the task, which is to choose the correct letter.<n>The first letter does not have the word "me" and the last one has it. Thus, we can narrow down the options to (C) or (D).<n><n>Next we can eliminate the incorrect options.<n><n>Option (A): The word "me" does not mean it is exclusive to the person as we can see that the letter starts with "t".<n><n>Similarly, Option (B): The second part "and her" implies that her husband does not have his own car.<n><n>So the correct option is D.<n><n>Input: I have three children, three brothers and three sisters. How many people does this describe? Choices:  No options.<n>Output: ReasonNo options given or provided.<n><n>I have three children, three dogs, and two grandmothers. <n><n>Input: Why can't you give me 5 dollars of this? Choices:  I was born in 5 5 5 4<n>Output: Reason(The numbers are repeated in the sentence)<n><n>The numbers could be read as the year one, two, and so on up to the year nine. But since they are all odd, one could read it as follows:<n>"I was born in the year three, the year five, the year seven, and the year nine", which doesn't make sense. Furthermore, if the sentence was referring to nine dollars specifically, it would say "give me five ones." So the sentence can't make sense as written.<n><n>Input: What time is it? Choices:  It's already ten.  It's 8:30. It's four o'clock in
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The teachers needed to get their classrooms ready for the school year.  What is one thing they might do? Choices:  A: talk too much B: teach children C: open boxes D: answering questions E: giving homework<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to identify the task at hand. In this case, teachers need to prepare for a new school year. This suggests that teachers are doing something necessary to prepare themselves for the new school year, such as setting up the classroom before students arrive.<n><n>Option C "teach children" is unlikely because the teachers are not preparing themselves to teach children at the time, but are rather preparing for the new school year.<n><n>Option A is definitely irrelevant because this is not a time for teachers to "talk too much." Instead, they're getting organized and set up before the students arrive. <n><n>Option B, "answering questions," is possible, but this would be part of a teacher's teaching responsibilities during the school year, rather than a preparatory task.<n><n>Option E, "giving homework," is irrelevant because homework is given during the school year, not during teachers' preparations for the school year. If anything, homework would be part of teachers' preparations during the school year, so this answer choice is also out.<n><n>Option "giving homework" (E) might be tempting, but the passage specifies that this is the “school year,” not “school day,” meaning that teachers can already give homework during the school year when it’s time. The reason that teachers haven’t already made enough progress is because their work during the school year is too time consuming.<n><n>The best answer is letter (E): giving homework (100%)<n><n>Input:  People believe that scientists and researchers use computer networks to create what? Choices: A: art B: websites C: apps D: 100% E: computers <n>Output: Answer Choices:<n><n>Input  A person is running to catch a train that will leave in 2 min.

Choices:  A: make friends B: mingle C: meet people D: small talk E: meet new people<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>To determine which answer is best, you need to first examine what you're supposed to do with these conversations. While conversation is undoubtedly a component of "meeting new people", the context of the question suggests the aim is to "make better friends". The definition of "trivial" is "not important; without substance": Trivial talk fits the description suggested. This leaves option "B" as the only plausible answer.<n><n>Input:Which of these is used to search for something in a group? Choices:  a. Filter b. Ducktrap c. Pile d. Brush e. Bam mop<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>The correct answer is option (D), "pile". The other four options are obviously incorrect and should be eliminated: (B) is a form of a filter which is already implied in the question to be used for searching out one thing, not a group of things as the question asks. (E) is actually a tool for cleaning bricks. (A) and (C) are types of fish gear and therefore have no relevance as answers. Option (D) is the one that makes sense and therefore, the answer is (D) "pile".<n>

Choices:  A: curiosity B: excitement C: boredom D: wonder E: fear<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question requires the person to be seeing something new, hence the word "New", not "old"...<n><n>This person is seeing something new, which suggests that they are experiencing new information. Since this is the primary aim of a person seeing some new thing, the most obvious feeling that they may have in this situation is curiosity. <n><n>After all, how would you feel if you were to see a new, fascinating thing? You'd probably have a lot of questions and be filled with curiosity to find out more about it. This is why option "Curiosity" (A) is the correct answer choice, as it best captures what the person would possibly feel in this situation.<n><n>Input:What is the purpose of most software applications?

Choices:  A: mouth B: jars and all faces C: kentucky fried chicken D: hand E: human<n>Output:		Reason:<n>As you probably noticed, the option A “mouth” was removed, because if you remove the question mark in A, that’s the answer, but is a common misspelling of the answer of the question B. <n><n>The correct answer for this question is D, “HAND”. The lips are indeed on the hand, which is a more common response than the mouth. The lips are part of the skin, and the hand is part of the skin, so you can also say the lips are on the skin, which is the only part of the human body that the hand is also on. Finally, the hand is on the arm, which is part the body, which is part of the body, and the body is part of the human body. Therefore, the lips are on the human body. <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question.<n><n>Input:(4/8)*100 Choices:(A):32.25% B:47% C:15.38% D:32.25 %(B)<n>Output: Reason:(<n><n>Answer: A)  A good rule of thumb is to subtract 10% from any multiplied fraction before converting it to a percentage.

Choices:  A: supermarket B: water C: cellars D: soup E: grocery store<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Add pepper and salt to *what* *meal* *if* it's bland?"<n><n>The first thing you do is eliminate all the options that do not make sense. The context is for pepper and salt when a meal is "bland.” You should eliminate options that are not related to food such as Supermarket (A) or cellar(D). Then, the first thing you do is to add the word “meal” to options. These options are Supermarket and water. To confirm that the meal is bland, the options are grocery store and soup. Grocery store is the answer.<n><n>Input: A company needs to hire someone who can perform what job well? Choices: A: build a bridge B: draw a map C: get a bounus D: make a movie E: go to the moon<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The first thing we need to eliminate is irrelevant options that the companies do not need to hire anyone for. The options A and B can be taken away. Now, the next step is to figure out what "the job well can" represents. There are four choices that could be a good fit, namely, get a bounus, make a movie, go to the moon and draw a map. However, the options get a bounus and go to the moon are eliminated since these are not something humans normally do. Thus, make a movie and draw a map are the ones we need to figure out and they are answered with option D: make a movie.<n><n>Input: After the rain, what can you eat from a wet tree Choices: A: the leaves B: the fruits C: the sap D: nuts E: buds<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The first step is to eliminate the wrong words which is from a wet tree.

The only items mentioned are "socks" and "jeans", neither of which can be purchased at a washing machine.<n><n>Option B ("laundromat") describes a business, but it does not indicate where items can be bought.<n>Option C ("clothing store") is the correct answer, as it specifies the location of purchase, since clothing stores are businesses where items can be purchased.<n><n>Option D ("closet") does not describe a location where an item can be purchased.<n>And option E ("shopping mall") does not include the actual act of buying. A shopping mall is a location in which items are purchased, but it does not describe the purchase itself.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is C: clothing store<n><n>Input: I am walking in New York City. I cross the street from Fifth Avenue to Sixth Avenue where I am stopped by a cop. He asks me for my I.D.  I do not have anymore change in my wallet which is missing my license.

E) Did someone stop you?<n>Output:<n><n>In this question, the options can be grouped into two categories: "legal penalties" and "other" options.<n>The question specifically asks if the subject in the story "got jail time" or was "arrested", which suggests that the legal/illegal aspect of the situation is more important than other events like "giving the cop a quarter", or "giving him change".<n><n>Therefore, option D ("Did you give him any change?"), would not fit in this case.<n>Likewise option E ("Did someone stop you?") doesn't provide sufficient information to answer the question.<n><n>Options A ("Did you get any jailtime") and B ("Did you get arrested?") are clearly the two correct answers here.<n><n>Input: You are traveling

Where might he spend most of his time today? Choices:  A: university B: college class C: class room D: classroom E: library<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The first thing to look for is the context of the report, which is typically a school assignment. We must then determine the steps James takes to prepare for it.<n><n>"University" (A) would be a suitable environment for a student to study for a school assignment, as it most likely has an educational purpose. But the question suggests studying, with the context of an assignment. Therefore, this is an invalid option.<n><n>"College class" (B) does fit the appropriate context of the question, and is certainly a place where a student could spend most of his time studying for a report. However, the report mentioned in the question is due tomorrow, which suggests he already has a good understanding of the material and therefore cannot spend his time acquiring knowledge in a class. As such, option (B) would not be the answer to the question<n><n>"Classroom" (C) is plausible in that it's a suitable place where a student might spend most of his time in preparation of an assignment. However, the question uses the word "tomorrow" rather than "today", excluding that option from being correct. The only remaining option is "college class", as it fits the question in regards to time and context.<n><n>Then based on the output, Reason:<n>James spent his time studying for his report in the library, where he found most of the resources he needed to complete his assignment.<n><n>### Sample:<n>**Sample Input:**<n>James was a student who was due to submit a report on Friday in class.

Choices:  A: dairy farm B: texas C: building D: michigan E: florida<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The option "texas" (B) is wrong because "best" implies "best of the best."  So James can't be in Texas, which is a fairly average state.<n>Next, the option "building" (C) is wrong because the sentence mentions only a steakhouse, not a building. Also, if James is in a building, he's not outside the South.<n>Similarly, neither option "michigan" (D) nor "florida" (E) would apply, because James is going to a steakhouse outside the South, not Michigan or Florida.<n><n><n>Only one answer is left. So the final answer is A: dairy farm <n><n>Input: A large crab is being kept as a pet. Which is it?

This question is ambiguous, since the answer choices do not fit the context of the text. For example, the "win" and "lose" answers (D & F) don't really align with what "friends" would do to each other, so those would be incorrect answers.   However, there would be no way to know whether the "winning or losing" answer (E) is incorrect, since there is no instruction to answer this question accurately.

Choices:  A: hunt B: pay merchants with money C: mail orders D: spend money E: demand satisfaction<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step of this question is just to read the words. Clearly, customers do something while they're in the store - they're looking for an item. In short, this question wants to identify customers. The options "hunt" (A) and "spend money" (D) describe a more active (and sometimes combative) nature, when in fact, many customers just look around the store while waiting on someone to help them. "Mail orders" (C) and "demand satisfaction" (E) aren't feasible possibilities for a customer in a store.<n><n>Because customers aren't hunting for anything, or waiting for a package to arrive, or looking to "demand" something, the answer is A:  hunt.<n><n>Input:The doctor was treating a patient he did what? Choices: A: gave the patient a cup of water B: asked him a question C: ordered medicine D: told a story E: touched him<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>First, this question invokes a doctor - so it's safe to assume the patient is sick. That eliminates options A (give a cup of water) and B (ask a question).<n><n>The only thing the doctor would be touching is the patient's hand - an option that doesn't make sense in this scenario. Option D (touch him) is clearly out of bounds.<n><n>Because the doctor is treating a sick patient, asking him a question (A) or telling him a story (C) is probably the worst thing the doctor could do. However, ordering medicine (B) for the other patient is a reasonable option. While the patient may not want to say that he's sick, it makes sense that the doctor - a trained professional - would order whatever he thinks the patient needs.<n><n>Therefore, the final option is B: ordered medicine.<n><n>Input:If an object is stationary, it has what property?

The bank will give you 1.7% percent (1/100) compounded quarterly for 4 periods (years) if you invest the money with the bank. However, the bank states that it will be worth 0% percent if you choose to do nothing. If you want to receive 17%, which choice should you take? Choices:  (A) Invest for 4 periods (16%) (B) Do nothing (0%) (C) Invest for 8 periods (17%) (D) Invest for 12 periods (17%)<n>Output: Reason: If you invest with the bank then you earn interest, and if you do nothing then you don't earn interest but you don't lose anything. Since you need to invest 100, and compound the sum in the account to 101 and then take 17% of the 101 so to get $101 x 1.22 and this is the bank offering you to invest 101 for 17% interest after 4 years then <n>$$ \begin{align}\text{The answer is: } &  101\times0.17\\ & =17 <n>\end{align} $$ <n>so the answer is invest.<n><n><n>### Instructions:Answer the multiple choice questions . <n><n>Input: The sum of a series of 7 consecutive numbers is 55.

The options are in line with possible solutions - meeting new people (B) could help address a sense of social isolation, making others laugh (C) could boost one's social confidence, and socializing (D) could help alleviate loneliness.<n><n>The final option is alcohol (E). While it could be tempting to choose it because of the word "liquor", the choice would be inappropriate for this scenario. Excessive drinking would hardly solve feelings of loneliness, and might even exacerbate it, especially if the person is alone while drinking and reflecting on the reasons for feeling lonely.<n>The only feasible answer is D: socialize, which fits the description for the best solution to a lonely situation.<n>

Choices:  A: trunk B: drawer C: suitcase D: book shelf E: washing machine<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>There is an underlying assumption in this question that "old clothing" is something that is found in homes. Therefore, people don't necessarily purchase such clothing, so trunk (A) and bookshelves (D) are incorrect options. Similarly, washing machines (E) aren't common places for clothes found.<n><n>To be able to access clothing in homes, people might keep it in drawers (C) or suitcases (B). These two answer choices fit the context of the scenario well.<n><n>Finally there is an outlier answer of a suitcase (B). This isn't because it makes no sense (it does), but because this is the least obvious choice of all. It wouldn't be the most practical in storing old clothing (as suitcases are meant for travel) and might not be in someone's home.<n><n>Hence, the final answer to this question is C: drawer<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>Input:The company is hosting an anniversary dinner for its employees. What should the manager bring as a celebratory dessert? <n><n>Choices: A: Cobbler B: Cheesecake <n><n>Output: Reason:<n><n>There is a good chance that the manager will bring a cobbler because Cobbler, being a pastry, is the logical dessert choice.<n><n>It is very unlikely that the manager will bring pie. (B) - Pies are not commonly eaten as a dessert in this day and age (unless there is an occasion).<n><n>It is not very likely that the manager would bring cheesecake - though this is possible, cheesecake would simply not be enough to mark 20 years of the companies existence.<n><n>And finally, it is unlikely that the manager would bring ice cream. (A) Ice cream is a dessert made of cream and is not celebratory like pie or cheesecake are.<n>Hence the final option (A) is the correct answer - Cobbler. <n><n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Input:What is the name of the book that is read in the classroom?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Sam didn't like the people he met while traveling.  What might he do to get away from them? Choices:  A: come home B: airplane C: learn from each other D: go out E: make art<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Options A and B don't make any sense in this context. It doesn't seem logical to "come home" or "get on an airplane" in order to get away from people, considering that the options assume Sam is no longer at home to begin with.<n><n>Options D and E refer to activities, specifically "go out" (D) and "make art" (E). This suggests that Sam is looking to take on a new activity in order to escape from spending time with these people. <n><n>This leaves Option C. Option C suggests the act of "learn from each other". Learning is a form of activity that allows people to develop individually without direct competition. Therefore, the only option in this context that allows for each person to "learn from each other" would be Option C.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What office furniture stores paper files? Choices:  A: drawer B: filing cabinet C: computers D: desk E: filing cabinet<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to identify the possible meanings of each option in relation to the context of the question and the question's intended goal.<n><n>Option "Drawer" (A) would likely be used for storing small pieces of paper, such as receipts or paperwork that the user would only store temporarily. It doesn't fit the context of "files" which usually refers to documents or other larger items that would need to be stored in a drawer.<n><n>Option "Filing cabinet" (B) makes more sense. It's common practice to store large and important documents in a filing cabinet because it has many drawers to provide ample room for organizing and storing documents.<n><n>Option "Computers" (C) is less likely because it may not necessarily store paper files. Additionally, it doesn't have the same capacity or organization features as a filing cabinet.<n><n>Option "Desk" (D) would likely be used to store papers that the user needs to access quickly, such as a desktop calendar or notes. However, it wouldn't be a fitting choice for storing large or important documents since it doesn't offer drawers or other storage compartments for filing purposes.<n><n>Finally option "filing cabinet" (E) is the best choice. A filing cabinet provides drawers with multiple compartments to store documents and it is a common office furniture used to organize and store paperwork. It is the most accurate answer to what office furniture store paper files.<n><n>Input: Can I drink water to get it? Choices:  What do you mean by that? What do you mean by it? What does it mean? What is it? Why not? Can you give me an example?<n>Output: Reason<n>(1) The word "it" could refer to either 'water' or 'drink'. Since the first question was related to 'water', there is no need to refer "it" as 'drink'.<n>(2) If the context is 'drink', then 'Can you give me an example?' is irrelevant.<n><n># 1.16-1.29<n><n># 1  A: is inefficient B: is not inefficient <n>Input:Which is more inefficient?

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Having your marijuana in bags help keep it what? Choices:  A: entertainment B: neat C: happy D: intoxicating E: illegal<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First, eliminate the options "entertainment" (B) and any answer similar to it. There is no obvious reason why marijuana would be useful for entertainment purposes, making this answer irrelevant. <n><n>Next, note that the options "happy" (C) and any answer similar are also unnecessary. There is no explicit reason why we would expect marijuana to be used by happy people or the like.<n><n>Finally notice that option "intoxicating" (D) is actually part of the question, which would eliminate other answers that do not contain this.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is D: intoxicating<n><n>Input:When you’re at lunch you want some what? Choices: A: bread B: noodles C: rice D: eggs E: fish<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>Here, eliminate any options similar to "bread" (B) or any options that are specifically "noodles" or "rice." It wouldn't make a lot of sense to have a full meal at lunch, given the context of this question. <n><n>The next step is to reason that there's probably something to do with fish. Here "fish" (E) isn't the exact language of the question, but the next most specific answer (Fish) appears, so that answers the question directly.<n><n>Furthermore, no similar answer to "Fish" is present in the choices set, eliminating the options F: Chicken and J: Pizza.<n><n>There's a strong chance that it's a simple question asking for the food item(s) that go well with fish.<n>Finally, this means that, since lunch is typically a meal, it would be logical to assume that there'd be some form of a meal involved, making the answer "meal" the most likely. Thus, the final answer would be E: fish and meal<n><n>

Choices:  A: revealing information B: being ridiculed C: problems D: more funding E: telling all<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Input:This question is fairly straightforward, and could be inferred from other questions posed on the test. Here, the company is "going public", meaning it is listing itself for trade on a public stock exchange.<n>Going public may be done for a variety of reasons, such as to obtain more funding or increased visibility with investors by making the company more attractive to potential investors. However, it is unlikely that this action is taken to "reveal information" (A), since the company would be putting itself on the stock market. It would make more sense for the company to do so because it is looking to obtain some of the benefits a public listing provides, such as higher visibility with investors and potentially more funding. Likewise, it is unlikely that "being ridiculed" (B) would be a driver of a business deciding to go public. A business would most likely do so to increase its visibility in the financial markets and obtain more trading volumes.<n>As far as being "ridiculed" (C), this scenario could certainly be an incentive for a company's management team to go public, since such a listing would increase the company's profile in financial markets and could bring increased investment from new or existing shareholders.<n>For option E, it could be argued that disclosing information about the company, a purpose of going public, could be used to attract new investors and increase funding.<n><n>The most appropriate answer, though, is B: "being ridicule" because it is the most sensible and relevant reason. It is common for companies to go public because they want to increase their visibility in the financial markete.<n>So the final choice is C: problems<n><n>Input:How would an investor who buys a stock typically expect to earn a return on his or her investment?Choices A: more than market return B: dividends C: higher return than market return D: dividends E: lower return than market return<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>1.B:Dividends. This is the correct answer. Investors who buy a stock typically expect to acquire a share of ownership in a company and receive dividends if the company makes a profit. Dividends are the cash equivalent to profits, and they are typically distributed to shareholders every quarter. The amount of dividends paid

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: medicine chest C: armpits D: grocery store E: kitchen<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To begin, we can cross out options that are not plausible in a situation where one needs deodorant. For instance, "to but some" (B) clearly does not make sense. <n><n>We can also cross out options that don't require an explanation, such as "medicine chest" (C), because where to buy deodorant is specifically being asked, while where the chest is, is not a question.<n><n>The rest of the answer choices can be narrowed down just to options that pertain to items you would find in a store - options "medicine cabinet" (A) and "grocery store" (E). Out of these two options only one of them answers the question, and that is "grocery store." The word "grocery" can be defined as a chain of stores that sell produce, meat, drinks, toiletries, and the like. Based on the context of the question it makes sense that we would be looking to buy deodorant in such a store, as opposed to the kitchen as in option (E) or medicine cabinet (A).<n>So the final answer would be E: grocery store<n>

Choices:  A: edge B: desire to win C: friendship D: rivalry E: skill<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to identify the most relevant nouns in it. The primary words that describe a competition are "edge" (A) and "compete"(C). These options are then evaluated based on their overall context.<n><n>"Edge" (A) means gaining some advantage or advantage over others. A competitive setting includes "someone" in the form of a rival or opponent. This word "someone" is usually used in competitive situations when it comes to rivalry. So the only suitable answer option from this context is "rivalry"(D).<n><n>The second step involves evaluating the two remaining options. Option "desire to win" (B) is not suitable because it does not emphasize the desire to win, which is the primary characteristic associated with competition. Furthermore, the word "win" (B) is often used in relation to sports, whereas "rivalry" (D) has no sports connotation.<n><n>"Friendship" (E) describes a situation where two people work together, but there is no intention to win against one another. In sports, where competition is common, friends would likely face each other as opponents, not allies. Therefore, the correct answer is "rivalry" (E)<n><n>Input: Which day will there be the most of what?

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you buy a ticket to sit in a room with a lot of chairs facing the same direction? Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>From the scenario, one can assume that the subject (seeking a place to sit) would want to be in the same room as all of those people facing the same direction. Thus, option 'C' - a theater - is not suitable.<n><n>Similarly, options 'A' (conference) and 'E' (church) would not work - conferences are generally not the same room as all the attendees, and churches typically do not feature rows of chairs facing in the same direction.<n><n>So among options 'D' (floor) and 'B' (theater), 'floor' seems to be closer to the desired seating arrangement.<n>So the final Answer is (D) = (floor)<n><n>Input: Is "a" an adjective? Choices:  Yes, they are (A)  No, they're not (D)  Yes, they need to be (C)  No, they do not (B)<n>Output: Reason<n><n>You can see this isn't an easy question to answer. There are multiple points you can make, and it all comes down to interpretation. On the other hand, the answer is not all that important... because that is what the judge is asking for.<n><n>The best option here is option (C). Option (D) is too harsh, and seems to be implying that it's not a part of the English language, which is a little difficult to be.<n><n>Option (B) tries to justify something which is not needed here. In short, option (B) is incorrect.<n><n>Option (A) states that it's simply an adjective. Again, it's not all that important to know whether it's an adjective or not.<n><n>Option (C) correctly answers whether 'they' are adjectives. Since 'they' is not given, the statement would be incorrect for 'they' to be adjectives.<n><n>This concludes that option (C) is the choice. So, the final answer is option (C) = "Yes, they are, in fact, adjectives."
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The keys were black and white, what were they attached to? Choices:  A: front pocket B: cabinet C: purse D: chain E: piano<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing we need to determine is what the keys can be attached to. That's probably a pocket. So the only choices that make sense, therefore, are A, B, and C.<n><n>The second criterion we can use to eliminate incorrect options is that the keys must come together as a single thing rather than be scattered about - in other words, they must be attached to a single thing. The keys to a purse (D) and piano (E) are clearly attached to two separate things. So these both must be wrong.<n><n>Of the remaining options, "Front" isn't really a "thing" at all, so it would be incorrect to say a purse is attached to a "front." So once again, two answers remain: A, B, and/or C.<n><n>It's then possible to determine which answer is correct by narrowing the options down a little bit. The key of the "chain" answer, B, doesn't come before the key of the "front pocket" answer, A.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is B: the keys were attached to a chain.<n><n>Output: The woman was reading a book what was the book about? Choices: <n>1: cats <n>2: turtles <n>3: birds <n>4: monkeys <n>5: mammals<n>Output: Reasons:<n><n>The first step is to read all the possible answers and eliminate any that aren't possible based on the clues. This means that we can instantly cross off'mammals' because we are told specifically that the book is about some other animal.<n><n>The second step is to eliminate the choices that are impossible, again, based on the clues that we know about the book. Birds and mammals are clearly impossible, since they are not mentioned, and the book is about an animal that is not a bird, so the answer must be one of the other three.<n><n>The next logical step, as is the case with most questions, is to eliminate the least-plausible explanation first. Given everything we know about the book, it is highly unlikely to be about one animal that was mentioned, turtles. It must therefore be either cats or monkeys. Because turtles and cats are the same size, it does not really make sense to assume that the book is only about one animal unless we

Choices:  A: get tired B: have legs C: skip D: not fat E: look first<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>Option "get"(A) is incorrect because you don't _need_ to "get" the ball, you _only need to run after_ the ball.<n><n>Option "have"(B) is incorrect because you aren't running to find a limb.<n><n>Option "skip"(C) is incorrect because you can't skip past the ball, the purpose of running is presumably to catch the ball.<n><n>Answer should be: "not fat"(D)<n><n>Input:Who can eat the most ice-cream in a day without getting fat? Choices: A: An army man\ B: A person without guts\ C: A person without teeth\ D: A baby\ E: A healthy person<n>Output: Reason for choosing C as answer should be: The answer is, that "A baby"(D)can eat the most ice- cream in a day without becoming fat. He should not choose the option with B which is a person without guts(even if he is a healthy person). Because he has no teeth. Even if he has teeth, he can't eat. <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the last question. All other questions were in some form or another answers themselves.<n>- Input: What's the easiest subject for teacher to teach? Choices: A) Chemistry B) Biology C) Maths D) Geography E) English<n>- Output: Reason: Teaching is not a job; teaching is an art. Teachers are always known to love teaching. Teachers are very passionate about what they teach and love teaching. Therefore, it will be very easy for them to teach a subject. Even it should be easy for them to teach the hardest subject like "Maths" or "Chemistry".<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do you buy treats for kids over a counter? Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n>Output:		Answer: C<n>Reasoning:<n>The second task is to isolate the correct answer. Kids (and adults, for that matter) don't purchase over-the-counter treats at a butcher shop (B). The next options (D, E) are both reasonable options that would cater to a general audience. However, we know the shop must sell snacks, as the question was about 'over-the-counter treasures'.<n><n>The answer of choice (C), though vague, best matches the information we have - it involves a commercial establishment where a general audience would frequent. Given the context of the rest of the sentence, it's likely that kids would visit a bakery or confectionery.<n>So the final option is C: confectionary<n><n>Input:The first step in writing a report is A: collecting data B: analysing data C: summarising data D: finding data E: choosing format<n>Output:Answer: A<n>Reasoning:The first task is to deduce the meaning of the words in the question. Option A is the most basic and obvious interpretation, because the question specifically states that reports are compiled based off of "data". When writing a report, we need to go find this data to begin with!<n><n>Options B and C are similarly obvious, because report-writing involves these activities. Option D is misleading as well since there is no obvious context as to why the report is being written.<n><n>The last option, E, is ambiguous. It's not obvious what a report format is. The question could mean the format in which the report is written down, such as on paper or on a computer.<n><n>However, in the context of this question, the choice seems to refer to the layout of the report as a whole. It might even imply that the report is divided into chapters or sections to make it more accessible.<n>So the final choice is A.<n><n>Input: What is the temperature of a red hot iron?

Choices:  A: house B: hotel C: green house D: college E: dorm<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The laundry room is only used by staff. That means it's not for public use. That narrows the choices to A (house) and E (Dorm).<n><n>The choice between A and E depends on whether the person is using the word "house" figuratively. Is a staff member's house really a "house" if that house is a residential building/dormitory owned by the staff member's employer? Probably not. In that context, E is the more correct choice.<n>The answer is E:Dorm<n>

Choices:  A: landscape B: east side C: countryside D: middle america E: georgia<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "landscapes" (B) is incorrect because it refers to the landscape view of the painting. This information is given in the second sentence of the prompt, meaning that the options must refer to "to capture the view" - not "view" in general. Furthermore, the mention of the artist being "famous for his very plain..." (E) makes it apparent that he was famous for his minimalist approach to painting rather than something such as east side location (C).<n><n>"Middle America" refers to the country of Mexico. This could refer to Mexico's location in Central America, making all of Central America a part of Middle America, but this isn't an option provided. Additionally, using "east side" (C) or "middle america" (D) would imply that the painting was based in one of these locations, which would be incorrect.<n><n>"Georgia" refers to the country, rather than the state. This contradicts the idea that the artist is famous for painting a particular view of his "plain" nature.<n>The correct answer, therefore, is E: Plain.<n><n>Input: What is a 1959 horror?

Choices:  A: grocery store B: refrigerator C: freezer D: plate E: supermarket<n>Output:		Reason: Choose the correct answer based on the context.<n><n>The clue that this question is focused on the storage of food is the fact that it's a question about "the cabbage spoiling." Cabbage is often eaten raw, and is therefore more commonly stored in the refrigerator (B) or the freezer (D). While the answer "supermarket" (E) is technically correct, it seems unlikely in the context of this question, whereas the options "grocery store" (A) and "refrigerator" (B) more accurately describe the food storage location sought by the user in the question.<n><n>Input How did the man get out of the room? Choices:  he climbed up the ladder A: slung B: climbed up C: used a ladder D: through the window E: a ladder<n>Output: Reason; Answer the question as accurate as it can be.<n><n>This question is based on the context. Climbing through the window (E) wouldn't make any sense, as a person wouldn't go from a room to outside immediately, plus a  window wouldn't allow the person to climb out.<n><n>In the context of the scenario, a man couldn't have slung around (A).<n>Climbing up (C), or through a ladder (D) would make the most sense, but the answer "he climbed up A: the ladder" (D) is more specifically the answer.<n>So the final correct answer is D: through the ladder.

Choices D and E involve "did", as well. Choice B involves "believe," but "believe" is a noun, not a verb (therefore, incorrect as well). Thus, the correct answer is C.<n><n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What does a judge do when someone is convicted of a crime? Choices:  A: conduct trial B: arrest C: bring in verdict D: pass sentence E: serve justice<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>When someone is convicted of crime, the judge is expected to deliver a verdict, and that is the most correct thing to do. Other options such as “conduct trial” (B), “bring in verdict” (C) are unrealistic, and therefore can be eliminated. “Pass sentence” (D) is also not a judicial procedure and is thus eliminated. The only option left is “conduct trial”.<n><n>Input:The word on the page is  A: a noun B: a synonym C: an adjective D: an intonation  E: a determiner<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The most probable meaning of a noun in a sentence is the subject. Other options are synonyms, adjectives, etc., but the context indicates that synonyms and adjectives can't be a subject.<n><n>Input: What is a noun in a phrase? Choices: 	 A: a prefix B: a subject C: a subject  D: a subordinate   E: all of the above<n>Output: Reason <n><n>In a sentence, a noun can either be the subject or the object. It can refer to a person, place, thing, and idea, or an animal. "All of the above" (E) doesn't fit the question. <n><n>All the options, except for "a subordinate" (D) are a noun. <n><n>So the final answer would be C. The word "subject" can be a singular or a plural noun, but this is not related to the question and therefore the answer remains C: a subject.<n><n>A "verb" is part of the grammar of a language, although it is also a function word, and a word is also a "thing".<n><n>Answer: <n>A word is a small part of speech in a sentence.<n><n>A subject is a word or phrase that acts as the “doer” of the action in a sentence, i.e. it performs the action.<n><n>A predicate is the word or phrase that performs the action.<n>The noun is the name of a thing, person, place or idea.<n><n>To ask if something is a noun in the context of this passage implies that it is being used as a noun in place of an actual noun in the sentence.<n>For example:
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would humans do when their legs are tired? Choices:  A: sit down B: make mistakes C: have sex D: reproduce E: excrete<n>Output:		The process of reproduction consists in two phases: gametogenesis and fertilization.<n><n>Input: Which is better for you? Choices: A: no B: some C: much D: too<n>Output: The word "some" implies a quantity that is less than the quantity "much," but is greater than the quantity "a little."<n>The sentence "some cake" suggests that you would enjoy eating a small amount of cake. "A lot of cake" might describe a bigger slice of cake, while "not much cake" might depict a single bite.<n>Thus, the correct answer is B, since "some" implies that you would enjoy eaten a small amount of anything, but it doesn't explicitly indicate how large the amount is. On the other hand, "much" implies that you would greatly enjoy eating a large amount of anything.<n><n>Input: In a restaurant, when waiting for the server at a seating table, what will they usually do? Choices: 1: Play a game 2: Talk to the nearby people 3: Eat their appetizer 4: Do something else<n>Output: The sentence "do something else" (B) could refer to anything. For example, the individual might take out a book and quietly read while they wait for the server to bring them their food. The same sentence could also refer to something inappropriate, such as texting.<n><n>The remaining options all have a clear, logical answer: playing a game (1) and talking to people (3) make sense only when no one is at the table. Eating appetizers (2) doesn't make sense either, since we know they're waiting for their food and not their appetizer. <n>The correct answer is B: the individual playing games or reading their book quietly.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is disease often spread but shouldn't be? Choices:  A: ghost town B: third world country C: human body D: rug E: hospital<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>From the question stem, the first option that springs to mind is "human body" (C). Since ghost towns and third-world countries can't be infected with diseases, so this has to be A or D. But human body might be infected with virus.<n>So we have to choose between B: third world country and D: rug<n><n>The first thing to note is the presence of the word "spread" in the given question. That suggests that infection is a possibility. So option B: third world country fits the context as a place where disease might spread.<n>However, if we are to consider that fact, it's unlikely that the researchers in the context would ever set foot in such a place without disinfecting their shoes. Therefore, we can infer that rug, the sixth option (D), is most likely what they're talking about.<n>Input: What's the best way for a scientist to travel to research stations if they wanted a smooth transport without interruption? Choices: <n><n>A: airplane<n><n>B: helicopter<n><n>C: yacht<n><n>D: train<n><n>E: car<n><n>Output: Reason<n><n><n>From the wording of the question, the obvious first answer is to travel by airplane (A).<n><n>The second option is helicopter (B), but that would be disruptive since helicopters can't usually fly through crowded populated areas. To the right, one can see what helicopters fly through.<n><n>So the correct answer is A: airplane.<n><n>```<n>### Explanation<n>The first task is always to understand the context of question.<n>Here, the question is talking about a scientist working on a research station.<n>They will be looking for a way to travel there without any interruptions, which is why the option A: airplane, is given as obvious choice.<n>The second option, helicopter (B) seems possible, but it is disruptive due to the fact that it can't fly through crowded populated spots.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is a snake likely to reside? Choices:  A: tropics B: nightmare C: wyoming D: bushes E: feild<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Context: The snake's habitat should be determined by the context of the lab. Option "nightmare" (B) is the best choice, because the snake is most likely residing in a nightmare and needs to be brought back. Option "tropics" (A) is incorrect as the scenario suggests the snake needs to be brought back to its natural habitat, not simply its natural habitat.<n><n>Context: The second context is the snake's size and appearance. Since the snake is "large" and has "spots", it's likely to be a pit snake, as mentioned in the question. <n><n>Option "nocturnal" (C) means "active at night" and the scenario invokes a snake that wakes up at night - indicating it's likely not a pit snake, at least not based on what we know so far. Similarly, option "black with a big head" (D) is incorrect, because the snake has "spots" and is large, meaning it would be unlikely to be a black snake with a big head.<n><n>That leaves "feild" (E) and "bushes" (E). Feilds are often open, whereas bushes offer shelter, making them an ideal place for a snake to hide and hibernate. Hence, option "bushes" is the best choice.<n>So the final choice is E: bushes.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below. <n><n>Input: what is a typical time frame for snake milking? Choices: 3:45 A: always B: never C: always 0:35<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The first set is a number of choices based on the context. We can't really tell what's "typical", but we can guess. So we start by eliminating those options that obviously are not possible. We know that this snake has to come up with answers that can be used to build a snake house. A snake will never have a 3:45 timeframe, so we can eliminate B and D. And C is the most incorrect choice in the context, because we know that a snake has to have a 0:35 timeframe that can be used to help build the house. We also know that a snake will always have
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you hear a viola along side many other string and brass instruments? Choices:  A: symphony B: band C: create music D: orchestra E: string quartet<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The options "band" (B) and possibly "symphony" (A) would not be appropriate. We want a set of instruments that would be appropriate for a larger performance of classical music and that has at least one string instrument. We can eliminate options B since it is talking in terms of a "band." We can eliminate option A since the other options in the choice do include string instruments.<n><n>The options "orchestra" (D) and "string quartet" (E) do include string instruments. They are plausible options for the full string ensemble (string quartet) as well as a full string orchestra (orchestra). Therefore options D and E are the best options.<n><n>However, option D refers to a string ensemble of any size. It could be an orchestra or a quartet. Option E refers specifically to a quartet and could in fact refer to either a string quartet or a string quintet if one were to play the viola together. So the full answer would be both "string ensemble" (D) and string quartet" (E).<n>So the final answer would be string ensemble and string quartet<n><n>Input: What would you find inside a musical instrument? Choices:  B: musical scores C: a musical note D: a song E: musical instrument<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>First, we should eliminate the options that do not include musical instrumentation. Option B is a song, which is a collection of musical notes arranged in a tune. Option C is a musical note, which is simply a single and discretely identifiable source of sound from a musical instrument, and does not make mention of other instruments. Option D is a song because it has something to do with music, but is not an instrument that would be found inside musical instrumentation.<n><n>Option E is a musical instrument. Therefore, we have a full answer that includes option E: musical instrument.<n>So the final option is musical instrument<n><n>Input:What does a violinist wear on his/her instrument?Choices: A: a capo B: strings C: a stand D: a case E: a bow<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Options A and B refer to the strings that attach the bow and neck to the violin body. Option C refers to the stand that holds the violin. Options D and E refer to the case (D) that violinists bring
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where are small grapes used? Choices:  A: picnic basket B: wine press C: juice D: fruit cocktail E: kitchen<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to determine what "used" means in the question. It suggests the grapes are involved in a process that transforms them or makes use of their properties in some way. <n><n>Next, identify which of the choices are relevant to this transformation, and which ones are not. Option "juice" (D) is not an accurate answer choice, because grapes are not used in the process of making grape juice. Similarly, the option "fruit cocktail" (C) implies that the grapes are mixed into a fruit cocktail, and therefore are not used in their original form.<n><n>That narrows our answer choices down to two: "picnic basket" (A) and "wine press" (B). The phrase "small grapes" suggests the wine is going to be made in a small batch, which is not what happens in a wine press; only large quantities are pressed through the machine. Therefore, the correct answer is A: picnic basket<n>

Choices:  A: soccer game B: fairgrounds C: movie theatre D: countryside E: state park<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The option "soccer game" (A) refers to a sporting activity, which is definitely not the place to find popcorn and cotton candy. <n><n>The meaning of "fairgrounds" (B) is in line with the given context, as it describes a place where such snacks and games are commonly found. <n><n>"Movie theatre" (C) would not be a good place to find these snacks, unless the movie was showing at the cinema.<n><n>"Countryside" (D) refers to a rural area with farmland and cattle, again not where you would find snacks and games.<n><n>"State park" (E) most clearly fits the description of snacks and games since it is a common place to find them. So "state park" is the most accurate answer.

Choices:  a: formal, b: informal, c: bad, d: good, e: etiquette<n>Output: Reason and answer:<n><n>Options which seem unlikely are often eliminated from a multiple choice question, and these options in particular suggest very unusual ways that piratical manners would differ from one another. For instance, option "formal" (A) - implies that piratical etiquette is different than formal etiquette - is less likely to be correct than the simpler option of "informal" (B) - which says that piratical etiqutte would be the opposite of formal etiqutte.<n><n>Options "bad" (C) and "good" (D) are confusing. We can eliminate either of them without even reading the remaining options, because the question never suggests that piratical manors are good, bad, or both.<n><n>Finally option "etiquette" (E) is a bit of a dead giveaway. It suggests that a modern, urban, polite piratical culture would be unlikely, which leads us to the final option of "B" -- informal manners -- as the correct answer.<n><n>Input:What is another name for the famous scientist, Sir Isaac Newton?

Choices:  A: michigan B: stable C: race track D: farm yard E: arizona<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>As with the previous question, you first have to define the context of the question before making an accurate answer choice. The only correct option here is "stable" (A), because the question implies that a horse would probably live in a place where it could find hay and food. Stabling, or putting the horse in a place where it gets its food, would be an obvious choice. <n><n>The remaining options are false because the question does not even mention stabling. You wouldn't expect a horse to be at an arizona petting zoo, which is a zoo that only offers stables where you buy animals. The remaining locations, arizona and farm yard are both inaccurate. "Arizona" is a state rather than a farm, so the phrase "on a farm" would have to be in the question. "Farm yard" is inaccurate since there are many types of places on farms. It implies that farms are only used for growing hay/food, but most farms also offer livestock for sale and agricultural businesses for their products.<n>So the final choice is B: stable<n><n>Input: What is the missing character on the card above? Choices:  The card has a heart, club, diamond and spade, but no  A: eight<n>Output: Reasonining:<n><n>Another basic reasoning task. Notice that the card has hearts and clubs, but no 7 or 9, which eliminates options B ("one of either a 7 or a 9") and C ("only one of either a 7, 8, or 9").<n><n>In the remaining options, the question provides us "an equal number of diamonds with hearts", which is a logical conclusion of the question. It indicates that the question card should have hearts and a spade. Hence the card is missing an 8 (not 0 or 1), which is present only on the spade. So the final answer is A: eight<n><n>Input: What are the two correct answers A: (5-3) =2 and (5/3) = 1.666 B: (5-3)+(5/3) =8 and (5/3)+(5-3) =9 C: 5 is less than 3 and 5 is greater than 3 D: 5 is less (smaller) than

Where might he keep it? Choices:  A: shelf B: place of work C: desk D: office supply store E: school<n>Output:		Reason<n>James uses a clipboard, but which of the mentioned locations would he use to keep it?<n><n>We need to first understand why James keeps a clipboard in the first place and what it contains before we can try to answer this question. A clipboard is a flat surface that can be used to hold papers. Based on the provided information, we can assume that James keeps a clipboard specifically for holding his papers. It is reasonable for James to store his papers on his desk, as it would be convenient and easy to access. Additionally, if he needed to take his papers to another location outside of the office, he could take the clipboard with him. Finally, a clipboard would be ideal for jotting down notes or writing important information that he could not capture otherwise. Based on these considerations, we can conclude that James would keep his clipboard on his desk.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E, school<n><n>Input: The store assistant saw the man trying on the same blue jacket five times.

So these choices are not correct. <n><n>The wet ground option (B) might be expected to cause danger on account of it being slippery. However, the scenario specifies that the rain has ended and the ground is in no way wet. That eliminates this option.<n><n>The water garden choice (E) is the best option and the only one remaining. The scenario suggests that the rain has ended, and there may be puddles.<n>So, the last choice would be E.<n>So the final option is E: water garden<n><n>Input:  I need an apple,  but not an orange.  Which of the fruit below are fruit that is not an orange  Or a apple?

The scenario says nothing about the orange. That means the possible answers are only going to be one of the other fruits.<n><n>A: Pear (1) is a fruit that is not an apple.<n>B: Grape (2) is not an apple. A grape is a fruit.<n>C: Banana (4) is not an apple<n>D:Strawberry (3) Is a fruit with not an orange flavor.<n> E: Watermelon (5) Is something like the orange<n><n>So the final answer after answering is A: Pear.<n><n>Input:  The weather is nice and warm.

Choices:  A: house B: den C: family room D: wood E: floor<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Bean bag chairs" are soft, fluffy seats that are typically meant to be relaxed in, rather than sat on or used for work purposes. Thus, the correct answer for this question is house (A), family room (B) or wood (C) to indicate that the chair is better suited for relaxation, rather than a workspace where you're sitting on a solid surface, such as a desk.<n><n>A den, as defined by the Oxford Dictionary, is "a place of privacy or seclusion". This includes private rooms in a house that are meant to be used for specific purposes. For that reason, den (D) should not be included as an answer to this question.<n><n>Similarly, we can exclude floor (E) because in most cases, floor surfaces are not desirable for sitting on due to their texture, firmness and lack of furniture.<n><n>The answer to which choice is most appropriate depends on the context of your situation; however, in general, wood, family room or house would fit for most settings.<n>So the final choice is C: family room<n><n>Input:What did the man get from the bank?

The question does not specify the type of currency, so it could be referring to dollars, euros, or pounds. (B) and (E) are inaccurate because they state the same exact value. There is no need to express the same number using different units, so answers (B) and (D) should be eliminated. (D), while a reasonable choice, does not provide enough information for it to be the correct answer. The bank would not send 1,000 dollars to a man's house if he only applied for 1,500. Therefore, this is an incomplete sentence, making it "ungrammatical". Hence, the right answer is (C): $1500 <n>so the final answer is C: $1500<n><n>Input: Who is the chef? Choices: A:  Jane B:

The fact that two locations are named and one is a geographical area in China eliminates the answer choices "jungle," "australian outback," and "bamboo grove."<n><n>Only "child's book," one of the options that doesn't fit the pandas' natural environment, is the right answer.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: child's books 
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

She yelled at him not to leave his things where? Choices:  A: toy store B: hall C: bathroom D: amusement park E: fairgrounds<n>Output:		Reason: <n>It doesn't say "don't leave your things on the floor" or "don't leave things on the carpet" or "any surface, for that matter". Billy's mother doesn't describe specifically the place where she tripped over because if she was yelling at Billy as she trips over his toys lying on the hallway floor it means that it's not the first time that the situation happens.<n> <n>So, the correct answer is D: Amusement park<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What are adult people usually expected to do? Choices:  A: shake hands B: own property C: pay bills D: smoke E: talk to each other<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Adults are typically expected to be responsible for the payment of certain bills and expenses, which is why "pay bills" (C) is the correct answer. This is further reinforced by the phrase "usually expected" in the question, which implies that adults are typically expected to take care of these financial responsibilities.<n><n>On the other hand, "speak to each other" (E) is not a typical expectation of adults. Speaking to each other is a relatively informal interaction, which is not always necessary or appropriate for adults.<n><n>Input: Which of the following best describe what a bank uses to give loans? Choices: <n><n>A: savings B: financial history C: credit history D: tax report E: income<n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>The key to identifying the correct answer is to pay close attention to the exact phrase used in the question: "what a bank uses". This means that the options provided should not be used by a bank in loan decision-making, but rather should be used by borrowers.<n><n>Based on this definition, "savings" (A) isn't a suitable answer, because it doesn't describe what a loan is used for. Likewise, "financial history" (B) is also excluded, since it doesn't give a loan directly.<n><n>Instead, "tax report" (D) is the best available option here. A tax report is a document that shows the amount of tax a borrower has paid, which is a crucial piece of information for a loan decision.<n><n>Finally. "income" (E) is also ruled out since it doesn't involve a bank's use of a document.<n><n><n>Input: I’m worried. I think I’m in danger. The danger is caused by the person who is in here is in danger. The situation is dangerous. The most important person. I’m afraid because the situation is dangerous.<n>Output: Reason.<n><n>The structure of this sentence indicates that who you're worried about is also the person who is in danger, which is why the answer would be "Because me" (Choice A)<n><n>Input: I got mad when I saw the result of my own test. The result might be different. I was surprised when I saw my own test
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Dan said that getting in line was the best choice because it would lead to what? Choices:  A: being ordered B: less confusion C: boredom D: standing in line E: have to wait for<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>We first determine whether "being ordered" (B) in any way pertains to what Dan said. While standing in line and receiving service is an orderly process, it is difficult to assume that Dan's reason for choosing a line is because it will result in him being ordered around.<n><n>"Less confusion" (C) is another option, but there is no indication that Dan is confused. Furthermore, it is unclear why less confusion would make line-standing a "good choice." <n><n>"Boredom" (D) is not a valid answer, since it does not fit the scenario. It is true that standing in line may result in boredom, but that would not explain why Dan chose it. He may even be standing in line for an enjoyable experience, such as an amusements park ride.<n><n>"Waiting for" (E) is the right answer, as it directly matches what Dan said.<n><n>Input:Tori thought that the most reliable approach to getting a grade for her math class was what? Choices:A: study a lot B: take math class C: memorize all the formulas D: write the answers E: answer the questions on paper<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The first step is to eliminate any answer unrelated to the actual goal of "getting a grade for her math cass." Options B (take math class) and E (answer the question on paper) are eliminated because we do not immediately know the outcome of the action (grading) or its purpose (to get a grade, of course).<n><n>Option D (writing down the answers) does not fit the desired outcome (grade). You can use calculators nowadays.<n><n>Option A (studying a lot) is not relevant, because it is not specified whether it would be useful for her to do so. She may want to study a lot, but it might not result in her getting a grade at the end. So we can eliminate that choice, too.<n><n>The last choice, option C (memorize the formulas), is an example of the goal. Getting a grade requires mastering the materials, and while the outcome is the same, option C is the only way to get mastery. The other option (studying a lot/taking classes/writing down answers) cannot lead to mastery, and neither can the desired outcome be achieved without mastery.<n>

Choices:  A: concert B: opera C: theater D: take class E: television<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to establish that "long saga" is describing a movie, and that the term "take class" is unrelated or irrelevant to the context. The operas and theatrical presentations wouldn't have long sagas - by definition, they are shorter productions.<n><n>Next, look for synonyms of the word "watch". What is the equivalent of “watching” in different mediums? Here, "opera" and "theater" can mean watching performers, but that implies "television" is the only choice that is actually related to "watching".<n>Therefore, you can eliminate "television" as well.<n><n>The final choice is between "take class" and "concert". The former fits the overall context of the question, but it would be odd to take a class in watching a performance, and the words "take" and "watching" don't exactly have a tight relationship in terms of meaning.<n><n>The correct answer is B: Take Class<n><n>Input: What will happen on the episode of the series of the film? Choices: 1: Take B: C 2: In this episode the hero of the hero of the series 3: A star of this series 4: The hero of the hero of this series 5: A star of this movie.<n>Output: Reason;<n>Step 1: First we look at the question carefully and clearly determine the subject of discussion. Because, from here, the purpose of answering the questions can be understood.<n><n>Step 2: Now we need to take the context of the question in order to answer our question. So in this case the scientists have been doing a lot of work in the lab and he is analyzing his data so that he can understand what happened in his experiment. We know that at this time he is looking for an end to the results.<n><n>Step 3: Then we look for synonyms in the choices given in the questions. So what kind of questions can be asked about what is written in the answers? What does "take B" mean? What could he tell about the performance in this production? Does it mean something?<n><n>Step 4: If we can get the meaning of the answer of the question through a logical reasoning, then we can get the answer of our question. Let's look at these choices and we eliminate what is irrelevant and what is

Choices:  A: school children B: parents C: get money D: require to pay taxes E: take money<n>Output:		Reason:The word "help" is ambiguous here. "help" may mean, to help in the way that is beneficial to school children rather than school adults or it may mean to help in the way of providing service to make easier the workload of parents for their school-going children. Therefore, the correct choice is C.<n><n>Input:Can you make a car for the world leader who is a great driver? Choices: 		A: Yes B: No C: Maybe D: You decide E: How?<n>Output: Reason of answer:The word 'a' indicates a proper noun that can be used with other modifiers (here- who is a great driver). Therefore 'you' cannot be used here as a subject. Thus, the correct answer is B.<n><n>Input:Who can see my eyes? Choices: 1: All humans B: All children C: All teens D: Only children E: No one<n>Output Reason:The word 'all' indicates the whole of the class of a particular item or group. Since the context talks about eyes, it means that all persons can see another person's eyes. However, it is incorrect because 'children' is an incorrect answer option. The correct answer is B. No one can see the other person's eyes.<n><n>Input: Who will see tomorrow's results? Choices:  C: Both B: Some D: Nobody A: No one B: Some D: No one A: Not all E: All<n>Output: Reason for answer:The word 'No' indicates that no will see tomorrow' results. Therefore, the correct answer is A (Not all).<n><n>Input: Who can play basketball? Choices: A: Adult B: Both children and Adult C: Only children D: No adults E: Some adults<n>Output: Reason the answer is: The first sentence of the context states that 'no adult' can play Basketball. Thus, there can only be two options 'only children' or'some adults'. Since 'both children and adults' has both 'children' and 'adults', it does not fit the context of the question and the correct answer, therefore, is D.<n><n>Input: What is he going to school for?

Choices:  A: gorgeous B: handsome C: pleasing D: glorious E: pretty beautiful<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The main task is to answer the question "Why did he find someone as ugly as him?" <n><n>Option A: "gorgeous" (B) does not make sense, since the person is probably not ugly to everyone; option B would be more likely.<n><n>Option C: "pleasing" (D) would not come to mind, considering someone's physical appearance is unlikely to change someone else's level of pleasure in their presence.<n><n>Option D: "glorious" (C) is a common way to describe beauty, but does not answer the question being asked - why did he find someone else ugly?<n><n>Option E: "pretty" (E) is the strongest choice - a word that is commonly used to describe physical beauty.<n><n>Finally option E: "pretty beautiful" (E) is a correct answer - the speaker is happy that there someone as ugly as him.<n><n>Input:How could you get the best of both worlds? Choices:  a: buy the better product b: use the better product c: buy both the products d: use both the products e: use both products but buy one<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The given hint asks us to pick the correct option. <n>Since "best of both worlds" implies having both "both the products" and "using both the products" is important to gain the maximum benefits.<n>Thus the only correct choice of two answer is d: use both products but by one.<n><n>Input:A man with a mustache and an umbrella got into a carriage and a man with a mustache but no umbrella got out of the carriage Choices:  A) the carriage was reversing B) the carriage was making a u-turn C) the carriage was making an s-shape turn<n>Output: Reason <n><n>Given information is : A man with a mustache & no umbrella got in a carriage and a man  & with umbrella got out from carriage.<n><n>Hence it means that both carriages can take both men.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Why is grooming often recommended to greasy teens? Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here, the context of the question suggests that we might be looking for a person giving a piece of advice. Grooming is a term that people use regularly in an advice-giving context to describe good hygiene habits.<n><n>We can exclude option A ("neatness," which is more commonly used to describe a person's organizational skills), as well as option C ("selfishness"), which doesn't make sense when referring to a person and doesn't line up with previous context.<n><n>Next, we can eliminate choice D ("cleanliness"). "Cleanliness" is a word that is often used in a physical sense (e.g. the act of thoroughly cleaning something). A greasy teen isn't necessarily in need of a physical cleaning - in fact, they probably would benefit from avoiding any such cleaning practices because they can be counterproductive.<n><n>The last two options are "better understanding" and "satisfaction." The latter could describe the positive emotional outcome teens might get from adopting good hygiene habilitations, but this is not specifically what is being asked for.<n><n>The appropriate answer is "better understanding," because grooming is likely a reference to "grooming," which in turn means good hygiene habilities. Option E "better understanding" answers the literal meaning of the question based on the context of the question and makes the most sense as the correct answer.<n><n>Input: Why does eating too much candy give some kids toothaches? Choices: A: tooth decay B: germs C: bad habits D: too sweet E: bad bacteria<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>Here, we can see from the context of the question (e.g. "toothaches") that there is a person who is asking a question and providing a specific answer. Given the nature of the question and its answer, this context would seem to imply that the speaker is a doctor, parent, dentist, etc.<n><n>The options of "eating too much candy" would seem to fit here. "Bad bacteria" makes sense as a concept, but doesn't quite fit what is being described and what the answerer is providing. A "toothache" in response to eating too much cake is probably not caused by a single type of bad b

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When having food at a formal place, what do you usually do? Choices:  A: sit B: being sociable C: talk D: drinking E: medium<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to carefully consider the context of the situation.<n>As we can infer from the word "formal", this might an occasion that the speaker is dressed to attend or is attending a party.<n><n>Secondly, notice that the choices offered do not offer much information. The choice "Being sociable" (B) indicates that the food might be meant for socializing rather than eating. This does not seem to be a common practice in most formal meals and thus is unlikely to be the correct choice.<n>The choice "Medium" (E) refers to eating in a moderately fast way.

Choices:  A: jewelry store B: case C: hock D: watch store E: pawn<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Given the context that the man is on the street corner showing off a wrist watch, the only possibility for him to sell this item is at a pawn store. Of the other options, option B (a jewelry store) isn't a place one would expect to buy a cheap watch (let alone pay good money for a wristwatch - the man would likely be looking for a pawn in this case). Option C (a hock shop) is also excluded because a hock shop is a type of store where they make purchases out of pawned goods from customers - in this scenario, the man on the street corner would be most likely looking for someone to buy his pawned watch, and thus a store of this nature wouldn't be best suited to do so. Option D (a watch store) is excluded because a watch shop specializes in offering more premium brands, as opposed to a cheap watch that is being touted by the man on the street. This leaves only option E: a pawn. Of the other options that are viable options for a pawn store, there is nothing here within the context to provide information about the man's motives for selling the watch - thus option E is not only a viable option, but the only one that can be answered to this question.<n><n><n>Input: A couple went on a second honeymoon and while they were gone, their dog ate what?

Option B is not plausible here, because a dog cannot eat a cat, and the couple have no pets at all. Option C is not plausible because a dog cannot eat pets food - it would probably throw it up after a few minutes of eating. Option D's choice of dog is also not possible here, because a neighbor's dog would not be left to roam freely in the house by its owner who was away at a honeymoon - the owner would likely leave their pet with someone in the household, which

Choices:  A: vessel B: box C: transistor D: submarine E: lamp<n>Output:		It's a pretty straightforward question. What kind of radio does someone "use" to reach base? You'll have to use your reasoning skills to find the right answer. If it's a question about equipment, choose a "piece of equipment". So, if you were driving a car across town, for example, you might use the gear shift to shift gears, the steering wheel to drive, and so forth. In this way, you would "use" the car in the same way.<n><n>So here, since this is a multiple choice question, it will help us to first eliminate irrelevant options before selecting the best one. We can easily eliminate Choices "vessel", "box", and "transistor" since they are nothing to do with radios. Choice E. "Lamp" is obviously related to radios, but it really does not help us find the best answer.<n><n>To find the answer, I need to select the best answer. Here are the options remaining. Choice "submarine" is definitely not the best answer, if you think about it.  It's just random. We probably guess so far because it's the only answer left.<n><n>Well what is this? "Submarine", "submarine"? That's not much help. But "submerge", "submarine" that's what!  It has to be "submarine". So the answer is D: submarine.

Choices:  A: eyes B: biology laboratory C: shower stall D: old cheese E: decaying matter<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Reason: The first thing to get clear is what "made from milk" refers to. At first glance, it may seem as if it simply means food made from milk, such as pizza, or macaroni and cheese. To understand what "made from milk " more widely refers to, consider the following definition from [Merriam-Webster online dictionary]<n><n>    \em{made:} adverb 1 : made from materials (such as timber, metal, or stone)<n><n>    \em{"built-in shelves" or "built-in bookcases" are made from various materials}\em{—J.A. Adande, The New York Times, \em{Feb. 24, 2001}<n><n>This definition suggests that "made from milk" can refer to anything created from milk, which includes but is not limited to food made from milk. It is therefore possible to find fungus growing on \em{anything} that is made from milk, such a cheese, the insides of a shower stall etc., however it may be uncommon or unlikely to find fungus growing in the decaying matter of a cheese. As such option C (old cheese) would be a more likely answer to the question. Therefore the final answer is C: old cheese<n><n>Input:What is the proper term for something that can be used to perform a specific action? Choices: 	  A: equipment B: device C: utility D: tool E: apparatus<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Reason: the first words we learned were probably "my mums knife", where the noun "knife" comes into play after the preposition "my" then the verb "mums" which comes into play after the noun "knives".The term equipment is the closest to the term we were probably exposed to early on in our lives, as we were probably introduced to the term "my mums knives" (where the noun "knifes" was then used after the noun "mums"). Furthermore, the term is often used when mentioning the equipment available to us on a task, which aligns with the context suggested by the scenario.Thus the final answer is A: Equipment<n><n>Input:What term would you use to designate a large expanse of land?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you find a metal rod in most people's preferred method of transportation? Choices:  A: airplane B: construction site C: shops D: engine E: broken bone<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to understand that the options given here are not related to each other. One of them is "construction site" (B) while the other is "metal rod". This places us in an advantageous position, because we can eliminate options immediately, and proceed to the next step.<n><n>The second step is to determine how the options are interrelated in terms of how they affect the rod. In B, C and D, we see that these options are closely associated with the construction of building and vehicles. By contrast, option E is unrelated to the rod.<n><n>We now know that a rod would most likely be found in a construction site or in engine. And B is the only option that mentions "construction site", so it would make the most sense.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer would be option B: Construction Site

Brad ordered eggs, toasts, and something to drink - these two details tell us he is at a restaurant, which eliminates the four choices that we've ruled out as irrelevant.

When he stands up and takes a step forward and watch the people pass in front of him. They all have their headphones on listening to their favorite music.  There he walks until he reaches a beautiful spot where he stops and listen to the sounds of nature.  He notices a man standing in the corner. He stands there watching as though he is watching something.  As he approaches he sees that the man has a newspaper in his hand and is reading it at the same time that he watches something in the corner.  What is going on there?<n>Output: Reason: The options are a mix of things that are unrelated to the scenario. The only one that actually fits is'reading the newspaper'.<n><n>Input:  The first case happened two years ago.  A father and his two children came to a large mountain to visit some family members that live there.  They are all enjoying the time they have together.  They climbed the mountain as they planned to camp there.  As they are sleeping, a huge flood struck the mountain.  It destroyed their campsite.  The father decided to take his children to a large cave that he saw when he was searching for their campsite. As they entered, they found a person sitting at the entrance.  When they looked at the man, they saw that he had a stick in his hand, and he
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Sammy wanted to go to where the people were.  Where might he go? Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n>Output:		Reasoning: A simple application of logic to rule out irrelevant choices. You can rule out "the desert" (B), because you're looking for the people, which is exactly what the people are in a populated area - but not deserted - and not at a roadblock.<n><n>The answer is "populated areas", which contains no contradictory elements.<n><n>Input:How do you remove a bear from your bedroom? Choices: <n><n>A: by getting out of bed <n> <n><n>B: by getting out of the house <n><n>C: by getting a shotgun <n><n>D: by making a lot of noise <n><n>E: by pretending that its a Teddy bear<n><n>Output:Reason:This is a trick question which makes use of the 'tricky' nature of the word "Bear."<n><n>The question asks how to remove one, but the word "bear" could refer to a number of different animals including both a bear and a Teddy bear.<n><n>The answer A by getting out of bed is wrong because this does not refer to a single bear, it refers to any bear. The answer by getting out of the bed could not apply to a Teddy bear because this involves getting out of bed and not out of the whole house. The answer by getting a shotgun is wrong because this involves having a weapon in hand and the bear could not be in range to grab this.The answer by making a lot of noises does not make the bear go away but disturbs the rest of the neighbourhood! Thus option E by pretending to be Teddy Bear is the right answer. <n><n>Input:A dog is running inside of a person's car.  If the person has a cat is the dog a _________ dog? Choices:  Diseased Feline Veterinarian Lame Dog<n><n>Output: Reason: Diseased Vet: Not sure what the question is asking. Maybe "Diseased Veterinarian Lopsided Dog" is the answer??!!<n><n>The answer, "Feline", means "a cat" (because not just any dog is a lame dog). It's not asking for the general category of a dog (which would be "canine"), but for a specific type of dog known as a "feline." It's asking for something specific, not a generalized characteristic.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What home entertainment equipment requires cable? Choices:  A: radio shack B: substation C: cabinet D: television E: desk<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n><n>Examining the options, we can quickly eliminate options which don't fit. We can eliminate option B (Substation) because the word "Substation" is not a home entertainment device - it is a power-generating facility where power generators are housed.<n><n><n>We can eliminate option C (Cabinet) for similar reasons.<n><n>That leaves us with the word "desk" as the only option fitting the context of the question - we're already assuming that the home entertainment device is a television, and desks are typically not considered electronic home entertainment devices.<n><n>Option E (desk) would be the correct answer in this case.<n>So the final  answer is E: desk<n><n>Input: How to determine the length and width  of a rectangle Choices:  A : square root B : squared C : sqr roots D: rectangles E: square root squared<n>Output: Reason :<n><n><n>Examination of the options reveals that option C ("rectangles") does not fit the context of the question ("How to determine the length and the width of a rectangle"). Rectangles are already a certain shape, thus they cannot be used to determine the length and size of a rectangle.<n><n>Option B ("squared") is technically incorrect - although using the word "squared" implies that you are referring to "squared," the term you are actually referring to is "squared root," which is the actual answer to the question. Additionally, the use of the word "root" is more commonly associated with a square than a square root.<n><n>Option A ("squared root") is a very specific type of square root referred to in geometry (square to the power of itself). The root we are looking for, however, has only been referred to by the name "square root" so far in this exercise.<n><n>Option D ("surrounded by one square") does not make logical sense as an explanation of "How to determine the length of a rectangle." If we assume that this option means "the length and width are determined by the square," then it is simply a circular explanation of how to measure the length.<n><n>The last option, E, would be the correct answer, because the word "square root" answers the question.<n>So final answer is E: square root<n><n>Input: Which is the largest of the following numbers?

Choices:  A: park B: make time for C: receive instructions D: take money E: leave work<n>Output:		Reason to eliminate: The word "errand" (B) is the reason this option was ruled out. This is a common definition of “run errands” being to perform a series of small tasks. There can be several "errands" (plural), depending on the individual. One can run several errands at once. So the word "errand" does not fit the context of the sentence, where the drug kingpin is giving a single task to his man.<n><n>Input: While in a restaurant, the girl stole a handsome man’s wallet, then she decided to do what? Choices: A: look at it B: return it C: write to him D: buy something nice E: read it<n>Output: Reason for eliminating: "Return the wallet to whom it belongs and explain your intentions," would be the most logical step for the woman to take, as taking someone else's money and spending it is clearly not what the woman meant by "buy something nice" (E).<n><n>Input:The man in the car crashed into the wall of their building, he went to the hospital. Why he went to the hospital? Choices: A : To see the doctor. B : To see his best friend C : Check up on his injuries D : To know his health E : Find a good restaurant<n>Output: Reason why option D was eliminated: The man in the car wasn't injured in the car crash. "Checking up on his injuries" makes sense for a person that was hurt in the accident.

This means there is no reason to keep a television in the attic.<n><n>The word "ground" (E) refers to the stadium, not the player's home. Therefore, it is unlikely that this word describes the object in question.<n><n>Therefore, the most appropriate choice is B: attic.<n><n>Input: She had been given one minute to present, in this time she had to remember which of the following best helped her? Choices:  i: it helped her to have an outline  ii:  it really did nothing at all iii: it helped her to practice  iv: it wasn't very helpful to have an outline at all<n>Output: Reasonin:<n><n>"it really didn't do nothing at all" (iv) is the correct answer.<n><n>The context indicates that the question refers to a task of 1 minute duration, and that "helped" refers to preparing well.<n><n>Option (i) is incorrect.  The phrase "it helped her to have an OUTLINE" is incorrect grammatically, as well as indicating that, by "giving her an outline", something helped her.<n><n>Option (ii) is incorrect. Given the context of 1 minute, option (ii) directly contradicts what helped was supposed to be effective at helping her prepare well.<n><n>Option III may be tempting because it sounds similar "to remember to practice well". However, both the context and grammatical structure of option (iii) makes it immediately distinguishable from the correct sentence.<n><n>Input: He made an offer which she couldn’t refuse. Which of the following is the most likely meaning of this phrase? Choices: i: the offer was too good to refuse or ii: the offer didn’t suit her or iii: the offer couldn't be refused<n>Output: Correct Ans: iii: the offer cannot be refuse<n><n>"Too good to refuse" does not follow the grammatical structure or the context of the sentence. The context indicates that the task of "offering" is something the speaker had prior interaction with the other participant. It makes complete sense that such "offers" cannot be refused.<n><n>"The offer did

Choices:  A: maine B: boston C: beach town D: coastal cities E: ocean<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option A is incorrect because the East Coast of North America generally refers to the U.S. East Coast, which encompasses Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, whereas Maine is a U.S. state on the New England coast. Furthermore, the term "East Coast" is typically used to refer to the coast of the Atlantic Ocean located east of the United States.<n><n>Option B is incorrect as Boston has a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean and is located in Massachusetts on the New England part of the U.S. coast. "Beach Town" refers to a type of town or city known for its proximity to the ocean and often has sandy beaches, like Florida.<n><n>Options C, D, and E are incorrect because North America is a geographical continent composed of North America and parts of Central America. Although the coastline is located along the east, North America also covers a vast inland territory.<n><n>The best answer would be "coastal cities," because it is the correct spelling for the name of these cities. Coastal cities also have large beaches, many of them are popular vacation destinations, and some even have ocean views on the other side of town.

Choices:  Pug A: black Pomeranian B: caucasian shepard C: boxer D: husky E: pug<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Option A doesn’t really fit as “black pug” is not an option. Also, it fits way better as “red pug”. So the best answer would be E: pug.<n><n>Input: What are the capital and currency of Germany? Choices:  Berlin Germany A: euro B: dollar C: yen D: Mark E: cents<n>Output:Reason<n><n>Option E doesn't fit because the Mark is a German currency and "cents" is American. Option A is probably going to be chosen as it seems to make sense. The correct answer would be Germany, Euro.<n><n>Input: In which town in Minnesota does the movie Fargo take place?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The game promised it was free, but the child's parents soon found themselves doing what for microtransactions? Choices:  A: costly B: captive C: contained D: paying E: caught<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n>Here, the question asked about the child's parents being led to spend money on microtransactions, which is quite possible, as there is nothing in the question that suggests that microtransactions are in fact free. <n><n>The first task after understanding the context is to determine the outcome of the story. It is obvious from the question that the parents were led to spend money on the microtransactions and the options (A) and (B) indicate that this is not a possibility, which means they are irrelevant to the question.<n><n>The next step is to narrow down the context of microtransactions within the scenario. That narrowed down the context to one with children, a scenario that is likely a mobile game, as parents of younger children would be less likely to be tricked into spending money for something on the phone or tablet of a young child.<n><n>The last step is to determine the outcome (or purpose) of the microtransactions. If the parents had been tricked into paying for microtransactions, then the outcome would be to lose money. This eliminates options (B) and (C). <n><n>The option (D) makes no sense with the story, as the child's parent would be unlikely to use microtransactions in the first place.<n><n>Finally option (E) is the answer to the question because the outcome of the child's parent paying money for microtransactions is that they were "caught" and this outcome fits with the wording of the question.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Jame's bare feet were burned as he walked, because the sunshine had made the surface hot.  Where might he have been? Choices:  A: disneyland B: snow C: windowsill D: street E: summer<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>We are provided some information about Jame's condition, along with some hints about where he may or may not be. With that in perspective, it's best to eliminate any options that may be associated with a cold climate such as snow or a window.<n><n>Similarly disneyland is best to eliminate, since it's known to have many attractions, rather than only one main attraction that might cause somebody to walk barefoot.<n><n>The street is the only option that fits the given information. The sun was making the surface hot, which means it has warmed the surface of a street in such a way as to expose someone's bare feet. This option is therefore the most probable conclusion.<n><n>The final answer is E: summer.<n><n>Input:Which of the following do all the names listed below have in common? Choices:  Allergies, asthma, sinusitis, hay fever, rhinitis, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, sniffle, sniffles, headcold A: allergies B: hay fever C: viral sinusitis D: common cold E: sinusitis<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>Each option in the choice lists is a separate medical diagnosis involving either the symptom of, or condition caused by, viral sinusitis.<n><n>Option "allergies" (A) has nothing in common with viral sinusitis, as it refers to a predisposition toward certain medical conditions (such as an allergy to pollen), whereas sinusitis is not an allergy itself but a complication caused by certain allergies.<n><n>Option "hay fever" (B) also does not share a common trait with sinusitis. Like allergies, it refers to a pre-existing allergy to something else - in this case, hay pollen. So it too can be eliminated from consideration.<n><n>Option "viral sinusitis" (D) shares the common trait of being a type of medical condition involving sinusitis.<n>Option "sinusitis" is the same type of condition specified in the answer choices, and is the most likely to be associated with viral sinus.<n><n>The final correct answer is then option D: viral sinusity.<n><n>Input:There are 5,

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The man was eating lunch, but rushed when he looked at his watch, why did he rush? Choices:  A: gain weight B: late for work C: heartburn D: bad breath E: early for work<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>By understanding the overall context of the situation, the answer to this question is already clear.The reason the man rushed to finish his lunch is because he's in a hurry to get to his work. Therefore, the man must rush to get to his work, and the option "late for work" (B) is the most accurate answer to this question.<n><n>In summary, one can be successful in answering this question by looking at the question's context, understanding the situation's background, and pinning down a specific outcome that would result from taking the actions mentioned in the question.With these key elements in mind and a bit of practice, you'll be well on your way to solving difficult questions like this one.<n><n>Input: In Japan, a man had become ill and had been taken the hospital to be treated.He would need an operation however, before the operation the man had had a heart attack, which was followed by two days without food when he had been taken from the hospital to the clinic. How many days had passed since the man had become ill and the doctor had become concerned about his health?  Choices: A: 5 days B: 6 days C: 7 days  D: 8 days E: 9 days<n>Output:  The final answer : A: 5 days <n><n>Input: A man has a brother. The brother of the man is older than his youngest son. He has another son who is younger than everyone in the family. Find the name of the man or his wife? Choices:  a: Father b: mother c: son d: daughter e: grandfather f: brother<n>Output:  The correct answer is b: mother Reason: The man has a son who is younger than the rest of the family but he has an older brother. This means he must be either the grandfather or father and the grandfather cannot be his brother. His mother's brother must be his brother and his mother's father must be his father. He has a brother.

Choices:  A: better job B: irritated C: feel safe D: save money E: headache<n>Output:		Reason for elimination:<n><n>Option "save money" or "irritated" (B and C) may seem like the plausible outcome,but the body guard's job is to protect a person and make him safe. so, the correct answer is E: feel safe.<n><n>Input: the man who won the lottery was very happy about his fortune and spent all his money and the rest of what on what? Choices: A B C D E<n>Output: Reason why elimination:<n><n>It is clear that none of the options A-D is the most appropriate answer. As we've already known from the previous question, he spent his money, and the rest of which on what is the most appropriate answer to the question. Choice E is correct: rest of his money.<n><n>Input:The person with a cold was told to rest by his doctor and was looking forward to staying home and feeling better for what? Choices:A B C D E<n><n>Output: Reason elimination:<n><n>The only feasible solution to the question is option E: feeling better. If the person was already at home, it would mean that he had already "stayed home", thus eliminating B and C. "Rest" and "feel better" are also a logical pair of words that only describe feeling better. The person who wants to feel better would do what the doctor said to do: rest more and stay home to recover. And no other option fits in the meaning of the question, therefore only E can be answered correctly.<n><n>Input:What kind of weather is suitable for doing the laundry? Choices: A Snow B Dry C Rain D No precipitation<n><n>Output: Reasons elimination:<n><n>Out of all the given choices, only A can be answered correctly: snow. Even though B might be tempting, its meaning is "dry", which is not appropriate for doing laundry. "No precipitation" can be eliminated because the question refers to the type of weather rather than the general time, and the time can be any day. Therefore, the only answer that fits here must be A: snow.<n><n>Input:  The woman who was on the diet lost a lot of weight and <n>the other <n>people she was with couldn't help but talk about what <n>she did to lose so much weight.

Choices:  A: mediate B: have rest C: stay in bed D: run out of steam E: go to sleep<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Meditate (B): is a type of therapy that can take many forms, including various types of guided meditations, body scan meditations, deep breathing exercise and others. But ultimately, the goal of meditation is to relax your mind, which helps you feel less stressed and more calm at the end of the day. While meditation helps you relax your mind and body, it doesn't actually cure stress or "recover" from exhaustion as the word "recover" suggests.<n>Though it may be nice idea to meditate when you feel stressed, it doesn't really help with recovery.<n><n>Rest (C): There are various ways to rest. Sleeping for at least 8 hours a day, is one way your body rest. It's good for health, especially if you are feeling sick.Sleeping is one important element of recovery, but it's not the only one.<n>Run out of steam (D): is a phrase meaning to feel exhausted, to be completely out of energy.<n>Go to sleep (E): a sleep is a time when your body is more rest. But it's not the same thing as meditating.<n>So the final result is A: mediate<n>

Choices:  A: alabama B: tennessee C: violin case D: music store E: bow and strings<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Think about location, because the answer is about fiddle-playing people who are based in the south. Therefore the answer can't be in a specific state or in a certain region in the south of Alabama.<n><n>The option that is most likely is B: tennessee, because it is in the South, and the string of states between Alabama and Kentucky (called a 'border state') have similar characteristics to those in the South, especially Tennessee.<n><n>The option C: violin case, while intriguing, is not plausible because it is specific to violin cases, not people. In contrast to this, the option E: bow and strings, is plausible because the stringed instrument is the violin. Therefore this would be the most likely answer.<n><n>So the final answer will be B: Tennessee<n><n>Input: How many days will it take to drive from Detroit to Houston? Choices:  a. 3 days and 3 nights b. 3 nights and 3 days c. 3 days d. 100 hours e. 107 hours<n>Output: Reason will be:<n><n>If you take a closer look at the question, you'll notice that 'days and nights' is repeated twice. As such:<n>Option A: 3 days and nights: This means a total of six 24 hour periods. To make this number of 100 hours, either the nights would need to be made bigger (6 x 4 = 24 hours, which is less than 100 hours) or the days would need to be made smaller (6 x 24 = 144 hours, which is a lot more than 100). Therefore, this is incorrect.<n>Option B: 3 nights and days: Three nights means a total of 72 hours, which exceeds the 100 required. Therefore this is incorrect.<n><n>The only way to get 100 hours would be if one of the nights and days were shorter. To get 100, option 3 (2 days and 3 night) fits as it is made up of:<n>3 days: 21 hours + 12 hours = 33 hours. Hence, option 3 (three days and three nights) is the correct answer.<n>So the final Answer will be

Choices:  A: new york B: coastal cities C: city D: coastal cities E: boston<n>Output:		Reason seafood is a seafood restaurant. It's a pretty specific location-based term that's commonly confined to towns and coastal cities, as opposed to the whole country of New York, or the whole coast of Boston.<n><n>Input: Which of the following sentences contain the subject? Choices:  The cat is on the mat A: The cat is on the chair B: The cat is on my chair C: The cat is on your bed D: The cat is on our mat  E: The cat is on its mat<n>Output: Reason : Except C, remaining sentences are compound and not complete.<n><n>Here, we can see that "cat" is the subject - it is doing an action and has a direct object that follows it in each sentence (mat, chair, bed, mat). The sentence "on the chair" is actually a verb phrase that describes an action going on in two nouns (cat and chair).<n>Since there is no such thing as "on my [noun]", it is not a complete sentence, and does not function as the subject of a sentence. The same goes for "on your [noun]". As such, this sentence does not contain a subject and needs to be crossed off as the correct choice.<n><n>The two remaining sentences are compound sentences composed of two independent clauses. While they contain many parts and words (such as gerunds, infinitives, and participles) they are grammatically complete sentences when taken together. Thus, these are the only options that contain the subject, and therefore, the correct answer.<n><n>So the final answer(s) is(are) A: The cat is ON THE CHAIR B: The cat is ON MY CHAIR.<n><n>Input: What should we do when faced with a situation like "I feel terrible today?" Choices: A: Tell everyone your opinions, like politics B: Just tell them about it, like weather C: Tell people what happened to you E: Talk about how you feel because D: You may not be able to tell them about your problems<n>Output: Reason:  A and B are unrelated to this question at all. They are totally irrelevant answers. C is also unrelated to this question. D could be the answer to this question, but it's worded completely ambiguously. It doesn't suggest that you can or cannot talk about the problem.

Choices:  A: television B: bus C: email D: web page E: la ville<n>Output:		Reasonng:<n>Explanation: The question is trying to understand where an advertisement could be seen while reading the news. Options A and B do not make sense as they do not contain news. Option D is also not the answer because the question does not ask where can you find a website where can you see an advertisment. Option E is also irrelevant as la ville does not refer to a location but, to the French name for the village. This leaves us with option C. <n>

She continued to do what? Choices:  A: gain weight B: augment C: dispare D: make larger E: expand<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, we can eliminate the options "gain weight" (B), and "dispare" (D).  The question doesn't mention how heavy the respondent is, nor does it mention weight gain. Therefore, option A, "gain weight" must be ruled out.<n><n>Moreover, the phrase "all of her efforts" in the scenario is indicative of the respondent's goal of losing weight. So she wouldn't be dissatisfied with a weight gain.<n><n>"making larger" (E) falls into the same category described above, as well as "augment" (C).  She wanted to lose weight but continued working hard at her efforts to do so. In a scenario where she was trying to gain weight, she wouldn't continue to do what she's currently doing, which would be "work out" or "exercise" or "exerciste." So, this also cannot be her current activity.<n>This brings us to option D, "dispare," which means "to become depressed or despondent" and "make smaller." Clearly, Jamie wasn't losing weight. But, she wouldn't keep exercising if she wasn't successful or otherwise dissatisfied with the outcome. So she wasn't dispare, either. In fact, we have enough information to eliminate all four of the remaining options, because they don't make sense when viewed from this perspective. So, the best answer to the question, "Reduce her waist size," is "make larger," or in other words do the same thing.<n><n>So the answer is D: make larger<n><n>Input:I was going for a walk outside with my puppy.   When I opened the front door to go out, he was acting strange and looking up at the doorstep like a crazy person. He was also whining really loudly, so I took him for a walk to calm down.

The noun phrase "spent most of their time" modifies those phrases, therefore we can discard all the options besides "C": "progress" and "training of thought."<n><n>These remaining options refer to the two noun phrases in the context, which is the transfer of information between John and James. The option "transfer of information" would be a better fit than the other option, as the noun phrase "communicating" refers exclusively to the "transfer of information."<n><n>In conclusion, the most appropriate word for this question would be "transfer of information," therefore it's the final answer.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:She loved buying products, she was driven by her what to shop more than any practical needs? Choices:  A: desire B: money C: time D: credit E: spending money<n>Output:		The correct answer is E -> spending money.<n><n>The purpose of this question is to test our knowledge about the psychology behind shopping.<n><n>Option A, "desire", should be eliminated because there is a distinction between "desire" and "needs". Needs (like food or shelter) are essential for survival, while desires are optional. In other words, a "desire" to shop would not be the dominant factor in driving someone's purchasing choices, as it is by definition less important than other needs.<n>Option B, "money", is eliminated because of its negative connotation. It would be less accurate to say that someone's purchase choices are driven by a lust for money, suggesting that they are primarily motivated by greed and materialism.<n><n>The focus of this question is on the psychology behind shopper choices, and it would be more accurate and less biased to describe their purchasing motivations as what they "spend money on" or what they have a "spending habit" towards.<n><n>So the final answer would be E - Spending money<n><n>Input:The manager thought of a plan to make his employees happy, because the workers have a high what, they don't expect much to begin with? Choices: <n>A: turnover rate<n>B: expectation<n>C: need<n>D: morale<n>E: budget<n><n>Output: The Correct option and Final Answer:<n><n>The key word that stands out in this question is "workers". It suggests that the focus of the question is on employees who work for the company. That would eliminate irrelevant option "budget" (E), as it would be uncommon for the manager to consider the company budget in terms of employee needs and morale.<n><n>Option C "needs" is eliminated because it is a general term that could refer to any of several different criteria. "Needs" would not be the dominant or primary factor the manager considered when deciding to implement a happiness program, so that option would be less likely than "expectation" or "morale".<n><n>Option D "morale" is eliminated because the use of the word "morale" suggests a concern about the mental state or well-being of employees, as opposed to simply acknowledging their basic "expectation". That would make it more likely the manager considered their psychological needs when deciding to implement the

Choices:  A: ocean B: symphony C: band D: music store E: music shop<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A is clearly incorrect, as the word "ocean" does not include someone playing the celli. Option B is correct, because the word "symphony" refers to an ensemble of musicians that includes at least one cellist.<n>Similarly, option D is also incorrect. Although the word "music store" includes musicians, not all musicians play celli. Option E is the final, most correct answer.<n>So the final option is Band D: music store<n><n>### Instruction:Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow.<n>Maintaining your fitness level involves more than going to the gym every workout. You must be physically active to promote good health. Regular exercise helps reduce body fat, maintains muscle, improves mood, and eases stress. To stay motivated and maintain a good workout schedule, start with short goals and build on them. You might starter hiking, using an exercise video, or swimming. Add new activities to your weekly schedule slowly, and set realistic goals. Your routine should change when your fitness becomes routine. Here's what happened to Jillian:<n><n>Jillian used to live up to her goal to exercise every day. Her schedule included exercising at home, going to  a fitness class, and even running. However, after a few years, she became less and less excited about working out. She continued to reach her goals, but Jillian's excitement had faded. How can her problem be solved?<n><n>A. Set new fitness goals.<n>B. Keep a written schedule.<n>C. Do more exercise.<n>D. Use exercise classes.<n>E. Make new goals.<n><n>#### Choice A is incorrect. It's an answer that can help Jillian stay motivated but it is not an overall solution for her to overcome her exercise fatigue.<n><n>#### Choices B and C are also incorrect. To answer the question, we need to identify an overall solution to how Jillian got herself off the treadmill and back into exercise mode.<n><n>#### Choese D and E are correct answers. To answer the question to get Jillian back into exercise routine, we need to find an answer that has a solution that works long-term. Thus, we chose choice C and D: Do more exercise, Make new goals.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Stanley had a dream that was very vivid and scary. He had trouble telling it from what? Choices:  A: reality B: imagination C: dreamworker D: nightmare E: awake<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here we use the Reasoning function to determine if the correct option can be eliminated without reference to the other options.<n><n>In this case, the last choice, E: "awake," is the only possible choice that does not match with any other options.<n><n>Because of this, we know that the other options must be more specific and that "awake" could therefore be ruled out.<n><n>Next, we consider the remaining choices. "B: imagination" seems likely to be incorrect, because Stanley's dream was scary, and he had trouble distinguishing it from reality. The dream he saw was therefore almost certainly not imagined, and probably more to do with reality.<n><n>"D: nightmare" seems plausible in some ways, but not in others. On the one hand, Stanley's dream was very vivid. It is logical to think something that is very vivid may be a nightmare, but it may not. Stanley's "dream worker" was certainly capable of creating something vivid and convincing.<n><n>Another difficulty faced by this question is "distinguishing." The answer could be either "distinguish or tell." However, one is always "telling" the difference between imagination and reality, rather than distinguishing.<n><n>Finally there is "C: dreamworker." It can be logically eliminated. "Dreamworker" (C) is not the same as "nightmare" (D) and "reality" (A). It is either of these, or neither of them.<n><n>Reasoning: "D: nightmare," because it is the only choice that can be ruled out without reference to the other choices, is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: Why was there a brawl at the local disco?

Choices:  A: serve food B: eat C: set table D: serve meal E: present bill<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question asks what a waiter does at the end of a meal. So the options exclude "eat" (B) and set the table (C). The two remaining options that refer to food (serving meal and presenting bills) can be eliminated because the question asks what a wait does. <n><n>However, an option still remains that answers the same question - the waiter serves food. So eliminating D and E.<n>So the correct answer is A.<n><n>Input:A dog eats a rabbit, a cat eats a dog, what does a fox eat? Choices:  a. A rabbit b. A cat c. A fox<n>Output: Reason : The question is ambiguous so need to check for validity, The options are 'a' and 'c'.  So the fox eats rabbit and cat but this doesn't make any sense. <n><n>

Choices:  A: carried by people B: guard house C: fly D: follow ultralight airplane E: group together<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "A" (carried by people) is grammatically incorrect and doesn't make sense in this context. When the scientist is referring to "geese," he is obviously talking about a group of geese, not individual geese. The other options also show a lack of sense, such as "follow ultralight airplanes" in Option B and "guard house" in Option C.<n>The only option remaining is "group together." This option is not only contextually appropriate for a group of migrating geese, it also fits the description by not requiring any form of assistance to be transported.<n>So the final option is "group together"<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question using the least amount of words.<n><n>Input: What does it mean when a child is referred to as "precocious"?

In this case, options A (bright), B (unintelligible), C (nice-looking), and E (happy) don't give any indication that they answer the question.<n><n>Choices D (picking up things) and F (very young) make no sense together with the phrase "precocious child." As such, they cannot be chosen.<n><n>Therefore, answers remaining are A (bright), G (smart), and I (quick).<n>The only logical answer would be "bright," as the parent/scientist refers the child as "precocious" in the next phrase. Giving the correct answer will keep it concise while being efficient.<n>So the final chosen answer is B: bright.<n>### Instuction:Analyze the given image and the questions.<n><n>Input: Image: https://img.learnium.me/questions/7/c2b4d983fc6b68da4ec31212921e2e58.gif<n>Output: Correct Answer:<n><n>The

Choices:  A. Help out B. I am glad C. Help me with D. I can help too E. No sir I can not.<n>Output: No sir I can not<n><n>The input statement can be dissected thus, "How about you help me... I can not..." The second clause of the sentence (with the question mark) implies that there are two possible responses to the question.<n>Option (B) "I am glad" is the wrong answer. <n>Option (D) "Help me out" doesn't fit with the preceding sentences, as the question is in the past tense, and "Help me out" is present tense.<n><n>Therefore, option (E) "No sir I can not" is the most accurate answer in this scenario. <n><n>Input: The Doctor: how can I help you?

Among the remaining, choosing the answer that is the contextually most appropriate would be the best way to arrive at the right answer, here.<n><n>The last one, "fraternity house" (E) is not only out of context (since the question doesn't mention anything about college, let alone a college frat), it is also quite improbable: The question mentions fried and alcoholic foods, not fried and alcohol.<n><n>Thus, since there is an unambiguity issue between the first and the last one, the best answer is B: plane.<n><n>Input:Can someone explain the meaning of AI? Choices:  B: artificial intellect C: artificial intelligence D: artificial imbecile E: artificial identity<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>First thing to do is to read the context and understand the purpose behind the questioner's question.<n><n>Then, the second step is to reason what's appropriate and what's not. We can't eliminate A (it isn't a right answer), so we keep on to the next step which is to reason what'll the right answer be.<n><n>"Artificial" and "intelligence" don't seem to fit together, but since we've come to that conclusion based on our intuition, I'd recommend we keep the answer choices as is and try the "fake out" tactic.<n>If the option "artificial imbecile" (E) is the right answer, it means it doesn't have what is asked by the questioner since it is "imbecile". But that's definitely not true.<n><n>Therefore, we can safely conclude that the answer is D: artificial intelligence, since "intelligence" seems to fit "artificial", based on our intuition.<n><n>Input:In 2018 there has been an increase in the usage of SMS by the American public.

She thought that there was more string on the spool, but it slipped out of her fingers when she reached the what?. Choices:  A: child's hand B: the last straw C: hobby shop D: end of line E: toy store<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The context indicates that the kite was lost and the main factor that contributed to the loss was lack of care. It is therefore likely that Sally made a mistake that led to her losing the kite.<n><n>The option "child's hand" (B) would have helped her to hold onto the kite, but it was not used.  Similarly, "the last straw" (C) refers to an object that holds something else together, but the person in this scenario did not have one.<n><n>Thus the options that refer to something that a person can hold onto and not lose are ruled out from the question, giving us options "end a line" (D) and "toy store" (E).<n><n>It is reasonable that if Sally had lost her kite as a result of her carelessness and the kite was a toy; then Sally would probably have blamed that she lost it only because she went wrong at the end of the line; if the toy was from the toy store then she would probably be angry that it was lost since she had to go all the way to the the end of line to fetch it from toy store. <n><n>Thus the answer is E: toy store

Choices:  A: florida B: denmark C: united states D: map E: california<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Even though the question invokes East Coast and Florida, it does not necessarily point to the conclusion that the East coast is all in Florida, which is why choices (A) and (B) are rejected. Further, choice (D), map, is a common sense answer that can be rejected.<n><n>Even though option (C) seems to answer the question indirectly, it offers no direct answer as to where East coast areas like Florida are found. <n><n>Therefore, the answer is option (E): california.<n><n>Input: Where was Mr. X born? Choices: A: Italy. B: Canada C: France. D: Japan E: Brazil<n>Output: Reason for Answer:<n><n>The given statements suggest that Mr. X was certainly not born in Italy, as he isn’t Italian. Also, he definitely isn’t from Canada, as he’s not Canadian.<n><n>Canadian citizens and Japanese ones can both be born in Japan, unlike Mexican citizens who cannot be born in Mexico. Therefore, neither option (A), (B), or (D) is a correct answer to where Mr.X was born.<n><n>Finally option (E): Brazil is the most viable answer because he was born somewhere in South America, and Brazil is located there. Therefore, this is the correct answer to the question.

Now there are X apples."  What is this an example of? Choices:  A: park B: coloring book C: garden center D: math problem E: gravity<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, X is the result of a math problem. The math problem is: "3 fall off", which translates into "X - 3". Based on the context of the dialogue, X represents the remaining number of apples.<n><n>So, the correct answer is D: math problem<n><n>Input: The car manufacturer made millions of dollars in profits from the sale of his product. Why? Choices:  F: He got a bargain  D: The price was too high G: He raised the price H: He got help from a friend I:He saved on expenses<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Reasoning:<n>Since H (help from a friend) is the answer choice and F (got a bargain) is obviously the opposite of'saved money', we can eliminate this choice.<n><n>It is possible that H and I (He saved on expenses) could be true. In this case, D (the price was too high) wouldn't be true. But the question does not explicitly state whether the price was too high (so we can eliminate this choice D).<n><n>We have 3 options left: A, B, and C.<n>G (he got help from a friend) and I (he saved on expenses) do not seem to be possible (otherwise, H wouldn't be true), but I is contradicting B. So, A and B are out and leave us with only H.<n><n>So answer choices F (the price was too low), G (he got help from friend), H (prices were high), and I (he saved expenses) do not help us understand why the car manufacturer made millions.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is H (the prices were too high), implying that the profits were derived from a price rise.<n><n>Input: A: The sun sets in the west.  B: The sun sets in all places.   C: The sun is rising.   D: the sun rises in the east<n>Output: answer is D
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Ben was an alcoholic and was in an accident.  Because of his mistake, he spent 8 years somewhere. Where was he? Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		Reason:This question has two answers; one related to alcoholism and the other related to the accident.<n><n>The scenario of the driver of the car being a drunkard is irrelevant, as it does not directly concern the type of place the person spent 8 years at.<n>"Prison" (A) might be a reasonable answer if the driver's alcoholism were related to the accident.  But since alcoholism is not necessarily related to the accident, it can be ruled out.<n>"Homeless shelter" (E) is possible but again, the accident is not related to the person's homelessness. Additionally, the sentence "because of his mistake" (E) suggests that "the mistake" refers to the accident and not alcoholism.<n>Therefore, we are left with "bridge" (C) and "neighbor's house" (D).<n>The scenario about the bridge can also be read as a joke. While possible, it's an overly complicated interpretation of the sentence, which is not ideal.<n><n>The answer "neighbor' house" (D) is the only correct answer that fits both the alcoholism scenario and the accident scenario. If the driver were intoxicated during a driving accident, he would probably be held at a neighbor's house, either to avoid criminal charges or until the alcohol could leave his system. In the scenario's context, it makes all the sense in the world that the man ended up in a neighbor's home for eight years.<n><n>So the final answer in this case is D: neighbor's house.<n>Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question:<n><n>Input:There was a murderer. This murderer wanted to find justice. He wanted to find justice for what? Choices: A: his victims B: his children C: his family name D: his country E: his enemies<n>Output: Reason for A and B: The person who was murdered may have been a victim, but the murderer's "victims" were the people he'd killed, and that doesn't seem to relate to finding justice.<n><n>Output for C: Family name is irrelevant since this murderer is not related to us, and again, it is not related to justice.<n><n>Output: D and E: There is no way to relate the murderer's country/enemies

Choices:  A: sights B: optical illusion C: optical telescope D: light microscope E: binocular<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This is a relatively straightforward question, as there are only a few possible answers. Option "A: sights" (A) is incorrect as it has nothing to do with optical devices. <n><n>Option "B: optical illusion" (B) is also incorrect as optical illusions do not require the use of an eyepieces. However, if we consider optical illusions as ones where light creates an illusion, then the answer is somewhat plausible. <n><n>Option"C: optical telescope" (C) is incorrect because a telescope is a type of optical device, but not all optical devices are telescopes. Options "D: light microscope" (D) and "E: binoculars" (E) are plausible answers as they are both types of optical devices with eyepieces, making them the correct choices.<n>So the final answers is E: binoculars<n><n>Input: What is the scientific term for the body temperature of a human being? Choices:  a.  fever b. body c. blood d. core E. heart<n>Output: Answer:<n><n>The answer to this question is 'core body temperature' (E). <n><n>This answer can be deduced by noting that the context of the question is that the scientist is studying a patient's 'temperature', and that the term 'body temperature' is being used to refer to only the temperatures of the physical body. Thus, the answer should be something that is not restricted to the physical body.<n><n>Option 'fever' (A) is incorrect, as it only refers to abnormally high temperatures. <n><n>Option 'heart' (B), is also incorrect as it only refers to the human heart and not to a person's body. <n><n>Option'body' (C) is incorrect as it refers to an individual's body, rather than their body temperature.<n><n>Option 'blood' (D) is also incorrect, as blood is not considered to be integral to an individual's core body temperature. <n><n>Therefore, the only remaining correct answer is 'core body temperature', making it the final answer.<n><n>Input:The doctor in the emergency room called the patient's friend to inform that the patient is being transported to hospital Choices:  a: to b: with c

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a good result of jogging? Choices:  A: insect repellent B: heart attacks C: improved health D: shin splints E: being tired<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this case, we must first understand what the term "jogging" means. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, "jogging" is defined as "to run with short, quick steps" and "to run or walk in this manner".<n><n>The word "result" could also refer to an immediate or lasting impact, a positive or negative effect, or a consequence - all of which could be a direct result of jogging. "Insect repellent" (A), however, doesn't fit this definition. A better answer would be "improved health" (C) since it refers to the long-term benefits of regular exercise. "Shin splints" (D) is likely related to overuse of the legs when jogging, which could lead to health issues. Finally "being tired" (E) could be a result of jogging for extended periods of time or at an intense rate, which is not in keeping with the jogging definition I've outlined above.<n><n>So, the final answer is C: (to be) improved health<n><n>Input:How do you find the length of a diagonal of a square? Choices:  a: you measure two sides and deduct the other two sides b: multiply one side by one side c: take half the perimeter d: do math e: you add the two sides<n>Output: Reason for Answer:<n><n>The concept of a "square" should help you narrow down the choices. The first two are obviously wrong since a square has four sides. <n><n>The options "add" (E) and "do maths" (C) refer to adding up the two lengths of a side. This, however, contradicts what we know about the definition of a square, and doesn't help us solve this problem.<n><n>So, we're left with "multiply" (A) and "take the half of" (D). It seems the two options mean the same thing. We can figure that out by looking at the diagram we were provided.<n><n>The length of each side is 10cm. The "shortest" or "most direct" connection between opposite corners of a square is its diagonal, and we were told that length of its diagonal is 30cm. It seems that the problem is asking us to calculate the length of the diagonal by using the "Pyth

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Sometimes fighting inflation isn't even what, because it is so negligible? Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To rule out the irrelevant option, "economic instability" (B). It doesn't make sense to fight inflation, which is a rise in the general price level, if there's economic instability. This removes option (B) from the equation.<n><n>Options "not noticeable" (C) and "boring" (D) don't directly affect the economy in any way. So these options can be ruled out as well.<n><n>The only relevant option is "spend more" (B). When inflation is low, it's unlikely the government would have to spend more on subsidies to offset the cost. Therefore, the economy would be stable and the problem of inflation would be manageable.<n><n>Input:The best way to get exercise when at work is what, because it is better for health? Choices: 	 A: walking B: taking the stairs C: a brisk walk up a hill D: running E: sit-ups and push-ups<n>Output:Reason:<n>The very first thing that stands out is that the options "walking" (A), "taking the stairs" (B) and a "brisk walk up a hill" (D) all require movement on the part of the individual.<n><n>The other option is "sit-ups and push-us" (E). It's unlikely this would be a viable way to get exercise because of the limited space. <n><n>Finally, option "sit-ups" requires more explanation. This would require a dedicated space, which is not realistic to expect in most offices. Therefore, the option of "sit-ups to get exercise" can be ruled out.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is D. The best way to get exercise at work is a "brisk walk".<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the last two multiple choice question.<n>Answer the last two multiple choise questions.

Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>A : Exposure<n>B : Patience<n>C : Study<n>D :  Cooperation<n>E :  Thought<n>The process of learning depends on the motivation, and how one feels about learning is essential to that process.  But there are also techniques that one can use to learn things, such as studying and reviewing materials, as well as asking other people for guidance and collaboration.  But the answer that stands out is "exposure".<n><n>This is because learning requires being open-minded and curious about things. You can't learn something if you never seek knowledge or even come across opportunities to do so.  There could be many instances when you don't know something or don't know how to do something, and you don't have to take it negatively.  It could be a chance for you to learn something new!<n><n>So the final answer - E: thought<n><n><n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a characteristic of thin glass? Choices:  A: break easily B: shattering C: melt D: bend E: hold water<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Thin glass" generally refers to glass sheets, panels, or plates that are very thin as compared to other glass products. It is not possible for glass sheets of such a thin size to break easily unless they are subjected to significant force, which would be inconsistent with the nature of glass as a generally brittle material.<n><n>Furthermore, "shattering" refers to the process in which a plate or panel breaks into many smaller pieces, while "breaking" refers to a single break across the entire surface. Therefore, "shattering glass" does not refer to break easily but rather break into pieces which is similar to D.<n>Next, "bend" would require considerable force and is impractical as glass plates are meant to support their own weight, while "hold water" would be the characteristic of a water container, not glass plates. It doesn't answer "What is the characteristic of thin glass?"<n><n>"Break easily" is the least correct option because it implies glass plates are very brittle and prone to breaking under moderate pressure, which is not the true nature or a thin glass plate.<n><n>"Melt" is an option that refers to the glass sheet melting upon heating, which would not result in thin glass plates as it wouldn't be easy to shape or form.<n><n>Finally "better understanding" is the correct answer given that there is no other characterstic, which means you need to dig a little deeper.<n>So the final outcome is E: Better Understanding. <n><n>### Instruction:For questions 6 through 10, complete the table by selecting either A or B.<n><n>6.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:John loved competing because he was very competitive.  He liked being about to divide people into what categories? Choices:  A: winners and losers B: perform better C: might win D: losses E: enemies<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to determine the purpose behind John's love for competing. This seems obvious enough, as the option stated explicitly states that John liked being able to compete against others. We can eliminate D as well for the same reason, as it suggests John liked losing more over winning, which doesn't make sense in this context.<n><n>The next step is to determine the type of competition John had in mind. The remaining options each focus on different facets of competition, so it is important to consider what type of competition John likes the most. Does he value the skill of his opponents, or does he value himself as a competitor? Does he derive joy from winning, or from competing?<n><n>The best answer here is "winners and losers" (A), as this is consistent with John's character. He is very competitive, and he likes being able to compete with other athletes.  John doesn't want to compete so he can lose, he wants to compete so that he can win. Competing is a competition, and John loves being about to compete with other people.<n><n>So the final answer to is : A: winners and  losers<n><n>Input:  She's the person who has never liked who? Choices: <n>A:  herself B: her friends C: her enemies D: her family E: her neighbors<n>Output: Reasonming:<n><n>There are a few important elements to this question that need to be considered. First, the context of the question is that she's the person talking about never liking herself. This points toward a relatively harsh stance against herself, indicating a degree of self-disparagement. We can eliminate options that don't fit the narrative as well. She doesn't like herself, and therefore doesn't like her friends (B), her enemies (C), her family (D), or her neighbors (E) either. So we can narrow the answer down to two options: she likes her enemies and she likes herself, which seem to be in competition with one another.<n><n>So we're left with three options:<n><n>I. She likes her enemies. (Doesn't fit the context of the statement.)<n><n>II. She doesn't likes herself either. (Doesn' like herself? )
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What could prevent someone from buying chistmas presents? Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n>Output:		The correct answer is 'C' stress. Stress refers to our response to a situation, or our emotional state. When we are stressed, we become less capable of coping with various situations and making rational decisions, even when all the information is right in front of us. Therefore, someone feeling stressed won't be able to shop as clearly.<n>Answer choice (A) 'Happiness', does not make sense. Happiness requires being engaged or even enjoying, or at least not feeling distracted or irritable by the situation, which doesn't necessarily mean people can shop. It says the opposite, in fact; 'happiness' can allow people to spend more, but only after they have gained their emotional footing first. <n>Answer choice 'B' 'Lack of money' sounds somewhat plausible because if you feel you lack money, you would not buy things for yourself or others. But stress doesn't necessarily affect one's financial stand. Money doesn't ensure happiness, and you can be both stressed and rich, so this answer does not hold much weight. <n>Answer choice (E) 'Exhilaration' is not the same as being 'happy', and you don't always need 'exhilaration' to'shop'.<n>Answer choice (D)'relief' holds some weight. People who feel stressed and distraught by the situation will be less able to concentrate and plan ahead. As a result, they will be more likely to make impulsive decisions when they are out looking for Christmas presents than when they are not.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Joe bought a ficus.  He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n>Output:		The question is asking what part of the home Joe bought the ficus for, so naturally, the answer should refer to a part of the home.  Some options would be inappropriate, including a "family room." While "tropical forest" (B) may seem like a valid choice, it's not because only a person who lived a long time ago likely had a "tropical forest."  Similarly, a "movie theater" (D) is not a practical thing to have in one's home.<n>The choices that remain are a "flower garden" (C) and a "hair salon" (E). Option (C) makes sense as a place a plant could be displayed.  While the question never explicitly states so, it also implies that one could place a ficus in a hair salon as a decoration. Hence, there are only two options to choose between - (C) and (E).<n><n>Input:The cashiers are getting low on supplies.  They really need what? Choices: A: money B: more employees C: more room E: credit<n>Output: The question asks for what the cashiers need.  Option (B) is inappropriate because the cashiers don't need more employees; their main problem is that they are running out of supplies.  Similarly, "more room" (E) would not solve their problem.  While a cashier may want more space, their job is not primarily about room, but about supplies.<n><n>Option (A) ("money") is too general, since not all problems require more money to solve them.<n><n>The only other option is "credit" (C). With "credit," it becomes clear that the cashiers need money to continue running their business. With more credit, they can charge new amounts of items and sell them.<n>So the correct answer to the question is (C): Credit<n><n>---<n><n>###Instruction:Fill in the following blanks with appropriate statements.<n><n>The doctor said that he would prescribe some antibiotics in order to __1__ Mary's infection. She needs to take the pills for a __2__ days. If the infection is __3__ within six days of administration of the antibiotics, Mary will be able to return __4__ school.<n><n>Output:The first task is
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Traveling underwater has many dangers, such as low visibility causing what? Choices:  A: disorientation B: due to C: meeting new people D: getting somewhere E: relocation<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>We know low visibility refers to seeing less than the usual amount of light penetration below the ocean surface.<n>So the next task should be to determine why low visibility poses a "danger" to underwater travelers.<n><n>Again, let's eliminate the wrong answers by ruling out all options that aren't dangerous or relate to the concept of "low visibility". <n><n>Option "disorientation" (B) isn't dangerous, as it would only affect the traveler's ability to navigate the environment. While disorientation could result in injury or death under certain circumstances (for example, if the traveler's vehicle crashes), this seems like a stretch. There is no guarantee that disorientation would lead to a crash.<n><n>Option "due to" (C) also isn't dangerous, because "due to" is a modifier for the preceding phrase: underwater traveling. A dangerous act underwater could be caused by something else, such as "water depth" (the first option). Therefore, this option is irrelevant.<n><n>The remaining options are both connected to the idea of "underwater darkness" or "low visibility".  Therefore, it is safe to assume that these options are referring to some form of injury or death. <n><n>Comparing the options, "getting somewhere" (E) is the only direct mention of injury or death, which suggests that it is the correct answer. <n><n>So the final answer choice is E: relocation

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where are there more telephone booths? Choices:  A: gas stations B: city C: london D: train station E: airport<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question refers to the location where "telephone booths" are more likely to be found. <n>This eliminates options B (city) and D (train station).<n><n>Given the context of the question, "gas stations" (A) and "airport" (E) are unlikely options because these locations would not be ideal places to look for a telephone booth - one would need to be on the move to reach a telephone booth while at a gas station and, similarly, at the airport.<n><n>"LONDON" (C) is unlikely to be the answer, because telephone booths are not common in the capital of the United Kingdom.<n><n>The remaining answer options are "london" (E) and "gas stations" (C).<n>Option C (gas stations) is the most probable because telephone booth usage - though not as widespread as it once was - is still fairly common. Additionally, it is fairly common to find a gas station every few blocks or so throughout cities. Therefore, Option C (gas stations) would be the correct answer.<n><n>So the final answer  is C: gas stations.<n><n>Input: Who had the better score in the math competition? Choices:  a: dad b: mom c: son d: brother e: teacher<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Option A: "DAD" (B), the second answer in line, is the answer which can't be eliminated since it does not contradict any of the other answers. This is because while the option doesn't exactly match the text, it doesn't indicate any contradiction; there would be no reason for us to think that a father could not actually out-perform his son in a math competition.<n><n>With A (Dad) out of the way, the next step is to check the other options. B (Mom), C (Son), D (Brother) and E (Teacher) in that order are all options to take a closer look at, the order being based on whether they might fit, as well as the logical implications of answering each one of them.<n><n>Out of A (Mom), B (Dad), and C (Son), it is immediately clear that Mom cannot have out-performed anyone, so that removes the choice E (Teacher), which is the last

Choices:  A: further cause B: wave goodbye C: attempt suicide D: insulting them E: thank god<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Avoid the options that start with a subject. This is because most of the options are nouns.<n><n>Option B, which means "wave goodbye," is not an option because it is unlikely that someone will "address" a person, then "wave" at them later. Besides, the phrase "address someone who is leaving" doesn't make sense.<n><n>The word "insult" is also problematic. If you truly insult someone, you don't expect them to be happy about it. Therefore, it would be irrational for the option with the most negative word ("insult") to choose "insulting them."<n><n>The options E and A involve people using adjectives, not nouns. Although personality qualities can be used to address someone, it wouldn't make sense to choose an option with adjectives in general. Adjectives generally do not appear in sentences containing a subject noun, especially the first one in a sentence.<n><n>Answer: E: thank you<n>Input: In the world of sports, what do teams often do if they beat their opponent?Choices:  A: play another game B: play another game with them C: change the rules D: change the rules with them E: change the location<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The options C and D should be eliminated. First of all, changing rules to play another game with them or changing rules with them doesn't make sense when you win another "football" or "hackey" game.<n><n>Another point for you to eliminate the options is: "Change the location" makes no sense especially in the answer that is "in the world of sports". And if you want to change the game, no one can stop you as it is usually "play against", this option just doesn't make any sense at all.<n><n>And if not those options, the other options are just too vague.<n>Answer: A and E change the game to something new with different rules such as the baseball and hackey<n>Input: Which of the following are examples of synonyms?

Choices:  A: kick the bucket B: mortal C: dead D: can die E: dying<n>Output:		Reasoned Out:<n><n>Here we observe the phrase "kick the bucket," which is quite ironic as "bucket" is not something that can kick back. Similarly, the term "mortal" carries the meaning of "death" but "mortal" is not the actual term used to describe a being that is death.<n>Now, let's consider all the options one by one to deduce the correct answer:<n><n>- A: Kick the bucket -  The phrase "kick the buckets" is a metaphor for death. So, this one is out.<n>- B: Mortal -  It suggests that a "mortal" creature is able to die and so cannot be immortal. But this is not the answer, since a being that is immortal cannot die is the question.<n>- C: Dead -  This can be eliminated due to the inclusion of the phrase "lacking immortality" in the question. Hence, the answer is not given here.<n>- D: Can die - It is incorrect due to the fact that we are asked about a person who is lacking immortality and not those that are still left with immortality. So, this option is out of scope.<n>- E: Dying - The option is out of the scope due to the fact that the question is looking for the answer about a creature who lacks immortality only.<n><n>So the final answer here is E:Ded.<n>Input:Why do people say that "The straw that broke the camel's back was the nail that was too short"?

Similarly, option (C) cannot be an answer, given that most people can't drive their own cars. <n><n>Next, we can eliminate option (D) because the answer does not suggest a physical transportation method - nor does it suggest a belief (like the divine). It's more of a way of getting around obstacles.<n><n>Only options (B) and (E) remain. However, they are both vague when it comes to transportation - that is, moving from one place to the other.

Choices:  A: wedding B: tennis C: closet D: left foot E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key thing here is to identify options that make no sense. Option "house", for example, is obviously incorrect because white shoes don't go with houses.<n><n>However, if the question is asking for places to wear white shoes, option "D" (left foot) isn't actually incorrect. It just provides a new context to the question. From that perspective, the options "A", "B", and "C" (all wedding-based contexts) should be eliminated.<n><n>As for the option "E" (closed foot), it doesn't make any sense if you look at it from a general perspective. It's not a logical or common concept to "close" a foot.<n><n>In the end, all the options except "E" (house) should be eliminated because they make no sense.

So, let's rule out the options that are related to a non-academic activity.<n><n>Option "tired feet", (B) is ruled out, as the answer is not going to be walking around or walking from exhibit to another just because that could be very time consuming and not productive.<n><n>Option "being bored", (E) is also ruled out, since the purpose of a museum is to learn things and not just stare at the exhibits until they get bored.<n><n>Option "gaining knowledge", (C) is a reasonable answer, so is already in consideration.<n><n>The last two options can be ruled out with some more reasoning.<n><n>Option "back pain" (D) is a very far-fetched answer, since a backache might prevent a person from going any further with the given activity.<n><n>Option 'pondering", (E) seems much more plausible, as it refers to deep contemplation as to why a certain idea is a more logical answer than another. It seems to fit the context of the question much better than "back pain" (C) and it is not implausible to think that a person studying the exhibits would want to sit down and think a bit.<n><n>So the final answer would be A<n><n>Input:How was the meeting with the CEO? Choices: <n>A: He told me that he wanted to take his company from local to global.<n>B: He was very nice.<n>C: He was very excited to tell us all about his trip to Italy.<n>D: He was so tired by the end of the meeting.  E: He seemed very interested in my company.<n>Output:Reasoning:<n>In the given context, it appears the CEO had one thing in mind: the company going global. In fact, as it turns out, he wanted to 'take his company from local to [a] global'. This eliminates option B (He was very nice). Option A contains the keyword 'take' that fits perfectly with the context, so A would be the most correct answer.<n><n>Input:The manager called a meeting with the entire office to discuss the company’s performance. This is what they talked about. Choices: <n>He was disappointed in how many people did
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you play a board game with your family? Choices:  A: toy store B: home C: school D: toy shop E: shelf<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question first identifies a scenario involving a family playing a board game together. From that, it's reasonable to conclude that they would either play the game in their home or elsewhere (not in a toy store or on a school).<n><n>From there, the remaining choices specify where the game was played. Since it was played at a player's home, it narrows down the options to three: playing on a shelf, in the toy shop, or in the home. The remaining choices eliminate themselves.<n><n><n>### Credit:<n>* http://www.evanthomas.net/blog/2019/01/23/lesson-70-analyzing-data-using-multiple-choice-answers/<n>   ![](../assets/pic130.png)<n><n>### The answer is not in the file<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

Choices:  A: bite B: lie down C: keep alive D: need to eat E: go to sleep<n>Output:		Instruction :answer the question<n><n>Input: If an animal is tired, it is likely to do what? Choices: A: bite B : need to eat C: going to sleep D: keep alive E: lie  down<n>Output: Instruction: Reasoning: This time, the second and third options are the same, which is "need to eat," so it can be safely eliminated as an answer to the question.  Now, all that is left is to determine which of the first three options is more likely to be the correct answer.<n><n>"Bit" (B) doesn't fit well in this context. The first thing you would think of when an animal is tired is something more restful, like sleeping. Therefore, "sleeping" (C) should be considered the correct answer.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When would you be able to see your reflection in a piece of wood? Choices:  A: burned B: polished C: carved D: composted E: nailed<n>Output:		Reasoning: <n><n>Option A: "burned" (B) immediately falls out of the running due to not being relevant information - someone might be reflective on something after they burned it, but they wouldn't be reflecting on the thing itself.<n><n>Option B: "polished" (C) is another possibility to look at. As a noun, "polish" often refers to a smoothed, shiny gloss. One could interpret the reflection of a carved, cut, and polished piece of wood to indicate one has accomplished the task of designing and creating said wood piece. In other words, "polish" could mean "success." Given this option would have been the one to choose, the correct answer should be C: polish.<n><n>Input: What is another name for "the first day of school?"<n>Choices:  A: the first days of school<n>B: the day before the first day of school<n>C: the last day of school<n>D: the first week of school<n>E: the first semester<n>Output:Reason: <n><n>Option "the last day of school" (C) cannot apply, since the question is about the first day/first day of school.<n><n>Options "the day before the first day" (A) and "first week of school" (D) are incorrect because they refer to additional information - it doesn't tell you what the first day is, it tells you what's happening before and after. As such, since there is no specific or particular day referred to in the choice, it is incorrect.<n><n>We can disregard the next couple of options "the day before the last day" (E) and "the first semester" (F) as they both do not apply since they pertain to the same day which is different than the first day, and they both also have no reference to the previous day or information that the previous question didn't mention.<n><n>So the option that is left is "The first day of school (B). Since this answer is the only one referring to the "first day of school" it must be correct. <n><n>Input: The following is a list of countries in the world. Canada, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the United States<n>Choices: 1. Spain<n>2. Italy<n>3. Colombia<n>4. the United Kingdom<n>5.

Choices:  A: high school gymnasium B: city C: park D: use E: los angeles<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>The context of this question clearly depicts the situation of a city. A basketball court is a sporting facility usually within a city limits, so its reasonable to assume that answer B- "City," is the correct response.<n><n>Input:Whats the population on Mars? Choices: A: around 8,500 people B: noone C: all D: very few E: there is life on it<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The context here gives us some information about Mars: we know there are people there (answer C), but it isn't exactly clear how many there are. Therefore, option B - "no one" is incorrect.<n><n>Furthermore, the question asks directly about population, and this suggests that we're talking about humans and not plants or animals. The options "all" (D) and "very few" (E) sound similar on the surface, but a closer look reveals that they're wildly different in what they refer to. The former is likely referring to all living things on Mars, while the latter is clearly limited to human beings. Given the clear context of the question, option A is the correct response: around 8,000 people live on Mars.<n><n>Input:Who won in football?

Choices: A 24-year old man is taller B a teenager is taller C the youngest is taller D tall or young C The youngest of these two is taller E a man over 30 is taller F a tall teenager is talle<n>Output: Reasonably:<n><n>The context is vague, which leaves much of the information open to interpretation. This includes the two peoples ages. It's reasonable to assume they are both under 30.<n><n>Therefore, the two answers to consider are A - "24-year- old man" and C - "the youngest one of

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would an adult man do to get ready for work? Choices:  A: dress herself B: shower C: dress himself D: drink beer E: drive train<n>Output:		Choice: Dress himself<n><n>Reasoning:<n>We can understand that this question is not about what man would do in modern times for work. Nowadays, a woman can go to work just as well as a man can. We also know that "drink beer" (E) is not on the list since he doesn't have to get ready. There is not enough information in this question to choose "dress himself" (D).<n><n>The answer is either "Showers" (b) or "Drives train" (c). Both options show a level of independence from the father. So we want to know if they prefer to shower themselves or drive the train by themselves (i.e. on the road to work).<n><n>The answer to the question comes when we think of the children's relationship with the father. We can infer that they probably use the father as a role model in terms of their work ethic and independence in general.<n>If "Soon" is considered, we can think of the father driving his children to work. But it's unlikely the father is the main driver of the boys. In this way, option C becomes the most likely choice.<n><n>Finally, we find that the most likely choice is Dress himself.<n><n>Input: If a girl is on a date and his parents are not home, then his parents are probably? Choices: 1: on a dinner date 2: walking a dog 3: at a movie 4: playing poker 5: playing soccer<n>Output: Choice : walking a dog<n>Reasoning: <n><n>To answer this question, we must first find if this girl is the only child. If she was, we know that there is a good chance that the mother will have to stay home (Dad taking the kids) alone and would not be available to babysit the children.<n><n>Now that we've established that the kids aren't the only children, we need to examine how they will interact with other people. If they had to go to another home with their siblings and then go to a store with another kid, that would be an example where they might go out as a family and the mother would be home alone at night to watch children together.<n><n><n>But if we rule out the possibility that the children are the only ones, then the mother would have to be at home alone

He didn't want any meat for it.  Where might Simon be taking the cow? Choices:  A: countryside B: city C: dairy farm D: butcher shop E: canada<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Simon bought the cow to put it to work, but he doesn't want any of it's meat. The cow would be sent to a dairy farm, where the cow's milk is milled and other products are made by the milk. <n><n>Input: Simon asked his friend to describe the dog he had seen.   Simon's friend said the dog had an orange coat and a blue tail. Simon wanted to call the dog what color? Choices:  a:blue b:orange c:grey d:none<n>Output: Reasonningen:<n><n>Simon asked for his friend to describe the color of the dog. He told him is was orange and blue. If someone describes being blue or grey, that is not the color it is actually referring to. For example, If someone is feeling sad or sick, they might say "I feel blue." Someone may sometimes use such idioms like "She is feeling blue today" to indicate that she is sad or feeling bad.<n>So the option is C:grey<n><n>Input: Simon thought that a new job was a great opportunity for him to see a different side of the world. What kind of job was Simon likely looking for?   Choices: a:travel agent b:pilot c:farmer d:scientist e:bank clerk<n>Output: Reasonining:<n><n>At the beginning of the text, Simon is unhappy with his current job and is looking for a new job. This may be his first job so all he is looking for is an opportunity to see and experience a different side of the work. Therefore, the most plausible answer would be a: travel agent, to see the world.<n>So the answer is travel agent<n><n>Input: A computer scientist and a biologist were collaborating to design a computer system.  The computer scientist suggested that the biologist had only two options in regard to  which kind of computer to buy:  a laptop or a desktop computer.  The biologist said,  "I want to be able to run lots of programs on my computer."  What did the biologist want from a computer?

Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question contains a clue about the context: "In short, when I open a new department store, I want to attract the largest number of customers possible." It's the context and the verb "should" that provide the clue that the answer is E: in New York.<n><n>Notice that other choices do not mention "build a new department store" as a potential option. That immediately eliminates D, because that answer does not address the question.<n><n>The context of the question is further strengthened by the phrase "new department store," which is the central focus of the question. The answer that does mention a new department store would be B, because "new" in a business context typically suggests something that offers a better or improved option. Offering the best option for your customers is a logical interpretation, thereby making B the correct answer.<n>So the final outcome is new york<n><n>Input: The best kind of shoes are made from which material? Choices: 	A: paper B: rubber C: cloth D: leather E: bamboo<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The answer is D. Leather shoes protect the wearer from wet weather conditions while offering a stylish appearance. These shoes are commonly used for casual wear.<n><n>Notice how the answer options contain no qualifier about their quality or affordability. Also, other words like "best" or "good" are never mentioned when describing these shoe options' appearance or functionality. They only mention material. These qualitative words would otherwise suggest that the answer options are better than other shoes in some way, but this is never suggested. Therefore, the answer can only be what it says it is - the best possible material.<n><n>So the answer is d<n><n>Output: Reason:A:<n><n>It's logical to choose "rubber" because rubber is commonly used in items that have to be water-resistant, such as shoes and raincoats.<n><n>The answer options do not contain any qualifier about being waterproof or sturdy, so other words like "good," "best," or "thick" are also not relevant for this question.<n><n>Chopping boards are almost always made of wood - it's the strong, natural material of choice. <n>So the answer is A: rubber<n><n>Output: Reaon:<n><n>Since the

Choices:  A: building B: friend's house C: classroom D: window E: front door<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again we need to interpret the entirety of the situation as an indicator of the correct choice. What could the dog be barking at? It's clear that it's facing the window - so it's in front of it. There's a chance that it could be barking at something in front of the window, but it's more likely that the dog is reacting to something across the street. If we look at the context and figure out the situation, we may decide that "presence across the street" is the most likely correct answer, and that "presence at a friend's house" (C) is too far-fetched.<n><n>The option "friends' house" (C) involves two distinct concepts that make no sense when looked at together: friends and houses. A person's presence at a friend's place is unlikely to elicit such a reaction from a dog. Another option, "presence across the road" (E), is similar in incorrectness to (E), but also involves the unnecessary concept of a "place" between the dog and the building. In contrast, the only correct answer combines the concept that the dog is barking at something it sees, which can be construed as a presence, while giving a clear indication of location with the phrase "a presence at the window."<n>So the correct option is A: building<n><n># Task 3<n>## A.

Choices:  A: suitcase B: filing cabinet C: computer D: desk drawer E: cloud<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question has several potential pitfalls for testers, and its intentional ambiguity.<n><n>There are many places in this lab to keep electronic files; for instance, on a flash drive could qualify and would answer the question.<n><n>It's important to note, however, that the phrase "computer file" is a red herring. This is because it assumes that a single "file" is the only place we can keep a file. In the question, we want the answer to "What can we keep a digital file in," not what types of files we can put on our computer.<n><n>Here's another possible choice that can trip testers up: "In a cloud?" (E). By using the word "in" here, testers might assume that this refers to files in virtual storage, such as Google Drive.<n><n>It should also be mentioned that there is no such thing as a "computer file" or a "computer disk," a term that appears in the possible answers. That's another red herring, which testers can quickly identify as the correct answer. If it's a question about a flash drive, then any answer that uses a disk/drive is incorrect, regardless of the topic (which might include anything from files to data).<n><n>So in this particular scenario, the final option is C. It is the correct answer because any place you can store a flash drive constitutes a possible answer here.<n><n>#### Reasoning:<n>```<n>Input:What is a computer memory stick?

Choices:  A: art room B: police station C: classroom D: desk drawer E: school<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The answer can be found by recognizing and eliminating irrelevant options. The most immediately obvious is "building" in option A (as the word "building" is not an antonym for "glue" and the option does not specify the type of building). Eliminate all options that are not related to "glue" or "building" using logic, as "school" (E) is about education and "desk drawer" (D) and "classroom" (C) are about desks. This leaves you with only the correct answer of "art room" (B). <n><n>### Input:Why are there so many people in our community that need the help we have been giving? Choices: 1: Because most of them are students and do not have jobs. 2: 3: We are getting more help from the government. 4: We are going to other communities when their people come to us looking for help. 5: 6: 7: Because there are not enough resources in our community to take care of every people so we must find help from other communities. 8: 9: 10: Because there is more crime in our communities and more of them break into each other homes.<n>Output: Reasonining:<n><n>In the context of the question, the people in need of help are those who are "in our community". Eliminate all options relevant to places outside "our community".<n><n>For choice 4, "when" implies the person who needs help did not come to the community (i.e. came from somewhere else). This is an incorrect option, because from the context it is implied that their help came from the community.<n><n>For choice 5, the sentence structure is wrong. The answer needs to be one word, followed by a verb/phrase which the answer describes. An example of a correct answer would be: "Because there is not enough resources in our communities" since the sentence is describing a reason for there to be not enough resources.<n><n>The next two incorrect choices contain multiple words, which is incorrect. An answer should not consist of two or more words. "Because there is more crime in out communities" (choice 8) may also be incorrect because choice 7 "crime" does not necessarily mean "we are being threatened by" but may just mean "something that happened due to crime",

It could be an urban area, but what is a "business district"? Wouldn't it make more sense to refer to a business district instead of an amusement park? Furthermore, what do you need to park your car for? Cars are a common product, so we can assume that you're heading for a different purpose. <n><n>Therefore, Options C and D are the most likely. Both of them refer to something far away from where you currently are. However, these could still be options for other reasons.<n><n>While Option C refers to the "car business district", it's unlikely that you'd be going there in these conditions - most people likely choose to visit car lots in more peaceful times. On the other hand, Option D refers primarily to an amusement park, which is where you're supposed to be heading.<n><n>Additionally, Option D is also a little more specific, mentioning that you're going to a "carnival park".

It seems to me to be a pretty even trade-off, especially since you could even argue that a grocery shopper has a higher responsibility than those of the others.<n><n>Given: The first day after the holidays, the classroom is very quiet and calm.<n>Which could be a possible explanation for such quiet behavior? Choices: <n>A. The noise pollution of the town<n>B. The lack of knowledge about the class<n>C. Distant relatives from the city<n>D. The students are on vacation<n>E.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:A night owl is what you'd head at sunset and you'd hear a what at sunrise? Choices:  A: morning person B: early bird C: lark D: early riser E: rooster<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Ideally, you don't really need to guess the answer here, because I guarantee that the correct answer is'morning person.'<n><n>For people that are unfamiliar with the word'morning person,' it is defined an 'early riser', which is to say that they are people who tend to sleep at night and wake up early.<n><n>Let's explain the definitions of this question as a means to better understanding them. The opposite of a night owl is an early riser. This is a'morning person.' A rooster is a kind of bird, so let's call it kind C. Choice D is correct. <n><n>We will give you a hint, by looking at the sentence and saying what you would do at sunset and what you hear at sunrise. You'd probably think there is no real answer here. But if you put any night person down (Choice A or C) then we're missing two answers here.<n><n>Option B is the 'early bird' who has to be placed there. So the answer is D: early riser.<n><n>Input: You don't like it but you love it Choices:  A B C Choices:  * E E 90 E 100 E 90 <n>Output: Reason :<n><n>There are a few questions to answer here:<n><n>**How many answers are there?**<n><n>There are *five* possible answers to the question. Let me elaborate on why I think that now:<n><n>**What does 'love it' mean?**<n><n>I will tell you one thing: it doesn't mean loving a specific thing.<n><n>**Who is 'you'?**<n><n>The answer to this question is an easy-ish one. Let'say you're the one who is supposed to give the answer.<n><n>**What are you doing in the answer?**<n><n>Let's do some guessing here:<n><n>**What is 'love it'?**<n><n>You might be tempted to say that you like your food but you hate other things. But there is no other things, for example, love. <n><n>Here we're actually looking at why you like food and why you hate other things. Maybe you are a person who likes vegetables while hating spicy foods. You can
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is small knight likely to be found? Choices:  A: fairy tale B: castle C: middle ages D: chess board E: doll house<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question's answer is not a simple matter of choosing the correct option. Some options seem more likely than others. It may seem tempting to jump to choice C (middle ages), but we must look carefully at all the options. Choice A (fairy tale), though seemingly unlikely, could be valid. A child's fairy tale in the form of a storybook could feature a smaller knight on a smaller scale.<n><n>The same logic applies to choice B (castle). It could be possible that a smaller knight is present somewhere within the sprawling castle complex, albeit hidden away.<n><n>The answer to this question is actually another question - "Where in a castle would we find a child?" The answer is, of course, in a dollhouse. The child could also have placed a doll in the castle, thereby creating a miniature version of the building.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: doll house<n><n>## Input: Where can you find small knight? Choices: 	A: castle B: chess board C: middle ages D E: fairy tale<n>Output: Reasonedexplanation:<n><n>The answer can be found within the last sentence: in a dollhouse!<n><n>Input: Where can you find your brother? Choices:  B: chess board<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>In this scenario, "brother" seems unlikely to be found at a chessboard; it's more likely to be part of a family<n><n>Input: What has 5 arms? Choices:  E: octopuses A: crab B: sea urchin C: starfish D: jelly fish<n>Output: Reasonexplanation:<n>The answer to this is clearly "octopuses"!<n><n>Input: A man is seen riding on train. What mode of transport is he most likely to be using? Choices:  C: bicycle D: train E: bus F: truck.<n>Output: Reason explanation :<n>This is a tricky question because you have to think of other forms of transport, too. The answer is clearly "train"!<n><n>Input : How do you make a pizza? Choices :  A: put marinara on top, put pineapples on the top B: sprinkle garlic on top, sprinkle tomatoes on
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What might two people competing get into? Choices:  A: stress B: debate C: argument D: winning or losing E: tension<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The premise of the question is that two people are competing on some kind of test or task, and that the stakes are high so that a win or a loss matters greatly. In such a situation, the two competitors may get into an argument or debate, but they are unlikely to engage in a battle or to get into stress.  Option E seems like the most plausible, given the context.<n><n>Option B however can be disregarded because stress in this situation wouldn't be caused by an argument between two people, but instead by the high-pressure context of the situation itself.<n><n>Option C and D can also be ignored because an argument does not necessarily imply stress, while two people engaging in a debate over something does not necessarily come to blows. Similarly, stress does not necessarily lead to a debate or argument, but only to "an increased mental and/or physical anxiety caused by a situation perceived as stressful."<n><n>So the final answer would be E: tension<n><n>Input: The farmlands were in abundance for the locals. They made a lot of ______<n> Choices: A: grain B: rice C: vegetables D: sugar  E: wheat<n>Output: Reason 2:<n><n>The farmlands are abundant, and the locals are making lots of food stuffs. This seems like a perfect situation for growing rice. They can also grow wheat and other crops like sugarcane. The question asks about what the local people make the most, so since sugarcane is a type of crop, option D is eliminated. Rice and wheat are common foods, so options A and B are wrongly eliminated. This leaves option E, which is a correct option.<n><n><n>Input:Which of the following statements is true about “Nike”<n> Choices:  A. The company began in 1970s in Japan  B.

Choices:  A: front door B: conference C: classroom D: refrigerator E: suitcase<n>Output:		Reason to answer<n>A paper notice on a house can be left in several different places.<n>An option that eliminates all the remaining options is the conference (B). <n><n>The next option we'll consider is the front door (A). <n>Here, we see two scenarios as opposed to one. <n><n>In one scenario, someone knocks on the door to find out what type of note they left in the house, which doesn't fit the statement. <n>In the other scenario, the paper notice is left in a place where it won't get damaged. Although it is possible that a note is left on the fridge (D) in this way, it doesn't eliminate the remaining options.<n><n>Next, we will consider if the note is left near the conference room (B). <n>Here, there is no damage possible. <n>Notice that the paper notice isn't on the conference desk.<n>It's an unlikely scenario that the paper notice was left directly on a conference room's table. <n><n>The last three remaining options are B, D, E. <n>If the note was left on a suitcase in the classroom (E), then a child in the classroom might damage it. <n>But the suitcase could be kept in a place where it can't be touched easily. <n>The last remaining option is D: refrigeration. The note can be attached on the fridge door. After reading the entire answer, the right answer is E.<n>It is a "refrigerator" (the correct Answer).

Choices:  A: africa B: north pole C: roof D: canada E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Africa is not a continent that is always covered in snow; on the contrary, many African countries, such as Namibia and Tunisia, experience relatively mild weather all year round. Moreover, the continent's southern states can see temperatures reaching 30°C in the summer, which means that they are never covered in snow.<n><n>Canada, on the other hand, experiences a fairly varied climate, ranging from the extremely cold North to the mild south. This means that although it is not impossible for Canada to have snow on its surface, such as during winter, it cannot be classified as "always having snow".<n><n>At the surface of the Earth, we do not always see snow – in fact, only about 10% of our planet's surface is covered in snow year-round. With this in mind, the most accurate answer is E: surface of earth.<n><n>Input: Where should you go in the morning? Choices:  a: work b: to the park c: to jail d: to the beach e: to bar<n>Output: Reason and Example:<n><n>"To jail" (b) is the most logical answer, as it means "to go to jail". In the morning, you would not go to jail. So the answer is c: to jail<n><n>Input: How deep does the ocean go? Choices: a: 10 mm b: 2 meters c: 10 feet d: 10 mio km e: 10 billion km<n>Output: Answer:<n><n>Answer E is an example of a "combination" or "comprehension" question. While the other 4 answer choices can be easily narrowed down by using clues from the context of the question, answer E provides an extreme value (10 billion km) that is so far from other answer choices that it is unlikely to be selected.<n><n>In this example, the question is referring to how deep the ocean goes, where "deep" is relative to other oceans or large bodies of water. Other oceans, such as the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, are significantly smaller than the Pacific Ocean, which contains more than 94% of all ocean water.<n><n>This is why answer choice E, with a depth of 10 billion km, is the most accurate as it indicates

Choices:  A: buy athletic equipment B: city C: espn D: town E: jerseys<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>This is another logical question.<n><n>Here, "a place" is a store that sells athletic equipment. A possible place for this store could be a city, where multiple stores are likely to exist within a city, thus satisfying the answer choice C(city).<n><n>Option B (buy athletic equipment) and D (jerseys) are excluded because those options are either too generic or specific. Only A(store) and/or C(city) best fits the question.<n>

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you put a light? Choices:  A: ocean B: desk C: universe D: attic E: chair<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question's instruction directs us to choose where a light would be placed, implying that the light is a physical object that can actually be placed somewhere. Since it is not physically possible to place a light in the universe (which encompasses space and everything that exists within it), this eliminates choice C. Choice D (attic) is another improbable placement for a light, because attics are usually high up by the ceiling, and light fixtures are generally low down; therefore, lights are not typically placed in attics. <n><n>There is no mention in the question about a ceiling or ceiling fixture, so it is most likely not in the ceiling. Since the universe choice is out but not the ceiling, the next most logical place would be on the desk where the light is not impeded from being seen (A). <n><n>Input: What would you see inside Mom's fridge if you opened it? Choices: 1: Bread 2: Milk 3: Eggs 4: Baked beans 5: Ice cream<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Here we have a question where the answer choices don't make any sense if you consider the context. Imaging a mom's fridge as a real object and being the mom's child, would you really find bread, eggs and ice cream in there? If Mom is a fan of milk and beans, then that's perfectly logical for her fridge I guess. If not, then I suppose it's possible to find ice cream, bread, beans and eggs in there.<n><n>It's a very specific and odd question from the beginning. But still can't predict that it is a brain teaser. It's a mind teaser I suppose. Since you can't think of the context without imagining a mom's frige in your home and see if it's realistic.<n><n>I'm afraid it doesn't come in handy much but it's still worth it to train your mind to think that way I suppose. <n><n>Reference

Choices:  A: air B: water C: earth D: space shuttle E: tunnel<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>This question is asking which location would be best for monitoring the level of oxygen in an environment.<n><n>The location that contains the most oxygen is the air, as it is primarily composed of gas. This eliminates the first (B) and third (D) choices.<n><n>Next, the tunnel (E) is the least likely choice. While it may be possible that the level of oxygen is monitored in some tunnels, it wouldn't be the typical place to do so. Tunnel environments are often considered high-risk environments and may require specialized monitoring equipment. Therefore, the correct answer is A: air<n><n><n>Input:Which one is bigger: a pimple or a mole? Choices:  a pimple B: a mole C: an eyelash D: a hair E: a zit<n>Output: Reason : <n><n>This question asks which of two objects is larger in size.<n><n>Option A is the choice for the answer because it means "blemish" rather than"a mole". There are two definitions in the Oxford dictionary for "mole" but none pertain to the definition of a blemish. Therefore, this answer is the only logical one because it is one of the only two choices.<n><n>While option B and D both describe moles, option B gives no further information so we don't know when it says "a pimple" whether it's referring to a small, blemish such as a pimple, or a large, flat area. That makes this a wrong answer.<n><n>Option E also means "blemish" meaning they are one in the same. This makes option C also not a correct answer because it is a blemish and not a mole. <n><n>Therefore, the only correct answer is A: blemish.<n><n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If you are fiddling through a music book when you should be playing, you probably dont have? Choices:  A: practice B: dexterity C: idle time D: knowledge of music E: conductor<n>Output:		Reason:  The reason is to make the final choice D. When a person plays a musical instrument, it requires dexterity, which means that one uses one's hands and fingers skillfully and quickly. The book is not a musical instrument, as such. Therefore, if one is fiddling around in a musical book, one is making use of one's idle time and conductor. <n><n>Input:  A man is waiting for a bus which will take him to town. But he is impatient and decides to walk. He arrives in the town. So after all he is at liberty to walk as fast as he wishes to. Except that the bus which he has passed will also arrive and take him back to where he has left from. Choices:  A. Freedom B. CertaintyC. Incompetence D. None E. Restraint<n>Output: Reason : The man may pass the bus but he can never catch it. So he remains at certain place. This is because  of his inefficiency. <n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Mary wasn't familiar with James, so she wasn't comfortable speaking with him. How might she come off? Choices:  A: cold B: unfamiliar C: unknown D: unacquainted E: shy<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>We are all familiar with the idiom "cold shoulder". It refers to a person who refuses to respond, to refuse to socialize. Therefore, it is possible that Mary's behavior could be construed as "cold" or "unwelcoming".<n>On the other hand, option "unfamiliar" (B), implies that Mary does not know James, and therefore would likely be polite if they met. As such, this option is incorrect.<n>Option "unknown" (C) carries an inherent negative connotation, as the word "known" implies. It refers to a person with whom a person has a good relationship or prior association, and could lead people to think that Mary doesn't know James at all, which will make them suspicious.<n>This leaves us with "shy" (D) and "unacquainted" (E) as accurate options. The word "acquainted" refers to a casual relationship with someone, which sounds about right.<n>So the answer to this question would be D: shy and E: unacquaintance<n><n>So the final answer:<n><n>Better understanding and Shy

Choices:  A: slender B: free flowing C: sparse D: unacquainted E: diet<n>Output:		Reasonning: <n><n>There are several possible answers to this question. One solution would be to select the answer that's most likely for the given category of people, in this case, "thick". However, looking at the context of the question, there is a more literal interpretation: what might someone want to be, if they're thick? The answer that fits this interpretation best is "slender", the opposite of thick.<n><n>Input: Who is the tenth president of US? Choices: 1: Abraham Lincoln 2: John F. Kennedy 3: Bill Clinton 4: George W. Bush 5: James Monroe<n>Output: Reason: <n><n>This question is a classic stumper, requiring the test taker to keep in mind the full context of the situation to come up with a good answer.<n><n>There are a number of possible answers to this question, but in this case, the answer is clearly "George W. Bush".<n><n>The question asks which of five past presidents a certain person has met. There's nothing in the text that says that person is currently in power. It would even be possible for the person to have met an entire list of presidents other than the tenth, because the question isn't really asking which of those specific individuals are the tenth president. The person could have met the first president instead, or the most recent president.<n><n>So the person has met at least five past presidents, but doesn't say which. The options include all the presidents listed. It's fairly likely that the person met the tenth president, who isn't Lincoln or Kennedy - both are past presidents, so that list is ruled out. That leaves Clinton, Bush (43) and Bush (41), making "George W." the best possible explanation for this part of the question.<n><n>Input :Which country is the largest in Europe? Choices:  ___:Austria ___:France ____:Prague ___:Switzerland<n>Output: Reason : <n><n>Although there are several possible answers to the question, the text clues lead us to only one realistic solution: Switzerland, which is the largest country in Europe and not France.<n><n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What happens to the conscience of someone who has been caught committing a murder? Choices:  A: jail time B: fear C: going to prison D: nothing E: feeling of guilt<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To answer this question, it is important to understand how conscience works. Most people generally see guilt as the consequence of committing a bad/wrong/murdered act. A guilty conscience would make a person feel bad about what they have done.<n><n>Fear of punishment is not part of feeling guilty, but another response which usually follows feeling guilty. Therefore, for the question, conscience would feel guilty, not fear of punishment. Hence, our final answer is that for someone who has been caught in a murder, his/her conscience would be guilty, not fear of guilt.<n><n>Input:Which of the following is true about the human body’s immune system? Choices:  This option: It prevents every new disease. This option: It always starts working immediately after contact with disease-invading pathogens. This option: It is highly efficient at keeping the body’s systems clean. This option: Its efficiency decreases over time. This option: It cannot get stronger.<n>Output:Reasonings:<n><n>This option: It prevents every single new disease.<n><n>To know that human body’s immunity cannot prevent every disease, I have to understand how immunity works. I understand that when we are born, we already have a set of antibodies that help us fight against illness, but these antibodies only prevent most people of getting affected with certain major diseases. Whenever we get a new disease, new antibodies are formed to combat it. This option cannot be considered to be true because I do not have much information about the immunity.<n><n>Let’s look at which option: It always starts to work after contact with disease- invading pathogens.<n><n>This is not true about immunity because it takes time for the body to produce antibodies against a new disease. If a person has not encountered the disease in question before, their immunity would start to work much after the infection. The best bet would be the second option, which is, it is highly efficient at keeping body’s system clean.<n><n>Human body has three types of barriers to prevent pathogens from entering the blood stream. They are Mucus, Skin and Saliva. These barriers are all immensely important to human survival. This is because pathogens generally do not enter these barriers after they meet the

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:How might people perceive someone they are scared of? Choices:  A: human B: happy C: dangerous D: strange E: weird<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The given question assumes that a certain someone (e.g., spider) will be perceived as anything but human by the onlooker. So, any options that describe human characteristics (such as happy and strange) can be discounted.<n><n>From there, the remaining options need to be considered in the context of this scenario. A "scary" person might be viewed as dangerous (C). But the choice of "dangerous" is too broad and doesn't convey a clear image of personality or character.<n><n>The right answer therefore, must convey some aspect of what it meant for people to fear this person. The word "weird," while not denoting any concrete characteristics, conveys the sense of fear that this person elicits. People might not like what this person represents or the feeling that person induces, which makes option E the most accurate.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: weird<n><n><n><n><n>### Instruction:The question has been divided into four segments. Each of the segments is in turn further divided into sub-parts. You should try to answer one of the sub-parts.<n><n>Input: How many segments did the lab write? Choices:  -Segment A is sub-segments 1, 2, and 3. Segment B is sub-segment 4. -Segment C is sub-sub-segment 1, sub-sub-sub-segment 2, and sub-sub-subsegment 3. Segment D is sub-sub-subsub-segment 4<n>Output: Reason for answer:<n><n>The key for answering this question is to understand the structure of the lab's writing. The question is phrased as "How many segments did the lab [type]?" (A), which implies that segment A might be further subdivided.<n><n>The lab's writing is divided into four segments (B, C, D, E), each containing sub-subsegments. Segment B (A - sub-segments) contains only one sub-segment (4), so this option can be quickly eliminated.<n><n>Segment C (A - sub-segment) contains three sub-sub-segments: 1, 2 and 3. Therefore, this option is also eliminated.<n><n>Because segment C doesn't contain sub-sub-subseg

Choices:  A: mouth B: grocery store C: constructing models D: shed E: box<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, option A is a possible answer. But it is more precise to say which part of the mouth is used. <n><n>Option B may be the most intuitive answer, but a quick glance at the question makes it clear that the grocery store is not an option. <n><n>Likewise, options C and D have many potential issues. If constructing a model, it's still unclear which part of the model is being used to hold the toothpick. And if it's simply a shed, then what part of the shed do toothpicks get placed in?<n><n>Thus, the only viable option is E: the box. <n><n>Input: What does "Tipton" say about Ms. Tattling's shoe? Choices:  Tattooed A: pink B: brown C: red D: black E: fuchsia<n>Output: Reasonining:<n><n>Here, the first step is to eliminate common words in the word "tattooed." Tipton isn't likely to be referring to a tattoo, so we can eliminate options A and C. <n><n>Those same words can be avoided in the other four options. Therefore, Tipton doesn't say anything about Ms. Tattle's shoe.<n><n>However, the word "Ms." can be removed from these options, as it doesn't significantly alter the meaning of what's being said. <n> <n>The final question: Why didn't Harry Potter's parents tell him about his real name?Choices:  A: Because they died B: They didn't want anything to have a different name than their other kids C: There was not enough time D: Harry was afraid to know E: Harry did not ask them<n>Output: Reasonning:<n><n>Here, it is clear that two options have potential problems: B) They didn't want a different name from their other kids and D) Harry was afraid to know the truth.<n>These answer choices are too vague and don't support a plausible answer. <n><n>When we eliminate these options, we are left with four options with concrete answers: A), C) and E).<n><n>A) Their parents didn't live long enough to reveal Harry's name B) Harry was afraid to hear the truth C)

For example, England is considered part of the great outdoors.<n><n>Finally the option E would be the right choice, since the fox hunting occurs in England.<n><n>Input:How can you find out your blood-type? Choices: <n><n>* A: You cannot find out your blood-types.<n>* B: Look at the inside of your foreskin.<n>* C: By taking a blood test.<n>* D: Go to a plasma bank.<n>* E: By getting a transplant.<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>B, D, and E are all related to transfusions and blood transplants, so these all should not be choices.<n>Next, C should not be a choice either, because it is the only answer among the choices that does not require a blood test. A blood test would not be appropriate to find out your blood type. <n><n>Lastly, A is incorrect, and should be eliminated as well.<n><n>Input:What should you keep away from your toddler? Choices:  * A: your credit card<n>* B: your new car<n>* C: your car key<n>* D: your favorite teddy bear<n>* E: your toddler<n>Output: Reasonnign:<n><n>This is a question about what a person should not give their toddler. For example, if a woman is expecting a child, it would be inappropriate for her to hand over her identity (credit card), her car, and her car keys. For the toddler, there can be only one answer - a plush toy. So this answer is correct because it is the only available choice that is not harmful or inappropriate for a toddler.<n><n>Input: You have just bought a car and want to get it serviced. Where would you take it for service? Choices: 1) Your garage; 2) The nearest automobile dealer; 3) A shop offering the service; 4) Your local garage; 5) A repair shop in the neighbourhood
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What cuisine is joked about eating small dogs? Choices:  A: backpack B: dog show C: chinese food D: french E: good hands<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to identify the context of the question - that is, what "cuisine" is being referred to.<n>Options "backpack" (A) and "dog show" (B) are likely not related to cuisine in any way.<n>"Chinese food" (C), while being a type of cuisine, is unlikely in this context to be a type of food that is commonly joked about eating dogs.<n><n>The options "good hands" (E) or "French" (D) aren't likely options, either. As there is humor involved, these options may be jokes that reference poker or french culture, respectively, but they don't seem to fit the context of the situation.<n><n>Finally "eating small dogs" (E) is the answer, because that is clearly what the cuisine is joking about eating -- small dogs. So the final answer is Eating small dogs<n>Input:What did the scientists wear under all their layers of clothes to keep warm during the experiment? Choices:  backpack A: french B: good hands C: chinese food E: dog show D: pigeons<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Input:If it does not snow, the school closed because it is snow days at this school? Choices:  close A: no B: no school C: no snow D: pigeons E: weather<n>Output: Reason <n><n>Input:How are the two choices good and the dog at the same time? Choices:  two good dogs A: two dogs B: the good C: good dog D: the two dog E: not good at the same time<n>Output: Reason Choices: The two dogs are good and the dog at same time (the dog and the dog in the same sentence at same time) because they are different in sentences  also for the options that means that the dog they are speaking about does not have any good attributes at all which is also wrong. The following sentence will further explain<n>Input:How will the dogs not get in trouble while not eating the food in the house (two good dogs, dog in same house, different sentences). Choices: A: pigeons B: good dog C: pigeon D: dog E: the two dog<n>Output:<n><n>Input:Which of the following are the dogs names

Choices:  A: nuclear power plant B: center C: basement D: main office E: bowel of the ship<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The context of the question is that it is a question of who controls the central computer. Therefore, the options B, C, and D are immediately eliminated due to the fact that those things are not places where someone would control something. The options A and E are not eliminated immediately, but their wording immediately makes them the preferred answer.<n><n>Option "nuclear power" (B) is problematic for two reasons:<n><n>Firstly, the concept of a "nuclear power plant" is usually associated with large factories, often used to generate electricity. It is unlikely that there would be a large nuclear power plant located in what is described as the main living quarters of the ship...<n>It sounds like he's looking in the wrong room.<n><n>Option "main" (E) is preferred since it best describes what the central computer control room would be in a building that is most likely associated with a spacecraft.<n><n>

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:There was a show on television about a ranger who loved flowers, but the next day it was about a gardener who also loved flowers.  It was a what? Choices:  A: countryside B: anthology C: dull read D: state park E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To answer this type of what time of the day question, you first want to pinpoint the time of day that the episode focuses on.<n><n>In this case, the answer is "the next day," because the second episode on TV was about a gardener.<n>The first episode mentioned a ranger which was a reference to the time of day that would have been shown in the previous episode. <n>So that narrows down the answer to Options A, B, and C:<n><n>Because Option D does not fit the narrative of the question, it can be eliminated.<n><n>It is possible that there is an error here, however, the time reference is not immediately clear from the instructions. The original instructions are: "There was a show on tv". This is ambiguous. A good way to clear this up is to try and understand the context of the problem which is a person talking about what they watched on TV. Based on that, we can assume that it would have been on the previous night, given that the subject is talking about the previous days program. With this more defined time frame in mind the answer is easy: C. a DULL READ<n><n>Input:What will Homer buy? Choices:  a bookstore a pizza a bicycle A:A bicycle B:A bookstore C:A pizza D:A bicycle E:A bookstore<n>Output: <n>Choice:A bookstore.<n>Output: Reason:- the question begins with "what will homer buy". So we can expect the answer to tell us that he will buy one thing in particular.<n><n>-the last item he will buy is a bicycle.<n><n>Choice:A bookshelf.<n>Output: Reaon:- the question begins with something that will give us the answer.<n><n>-the bicycle will be found on the bicycle.<n>So we can say that Homer will buy it or that he will buy it on the first choice.<n><n>So A has to be the answer.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I have a vintage, decorative light source in my possession, what is it likely to be? Choices:  A: sun B: sky C: candle D: house E: lamp<n>Output:		Reason: This question asks which light source is most likely to be a "vintage, decorative" light source. "The sun" (A) would likely be in the incorrect answer. In other worlds, the sun is an obvious light source, so it's likely that the vintage, decorate light is something other than the sun.<n><n>"The sky" (B) is also unlikely. According to the question, the light source is not in the sky, it is the sky itself. If the sky is a light source, it's in all likelihood not a "vintage" one.<n><n>Next, we would eliminate "the candle" (C) because it's not logical to think the sun, or the sky, could be a vintage, deocrative light source. <n><n>The next option to be eliminated is "the house" (E), for similar reasons explained above. <n><n>Finally, "the lamp" (D) is the correct answer. According to the question it is the one light source in this case that's not "the sun," "the sky," "the candle," or "the house." It is the one light source that fits the question.<n>So now the final answer is D: lamp<n><n>Input:A friend says they are looking forward to spending some quality time with their partner next weekend. This most likely means? Choices:  I: It's a wedding. It's a birthday. II: It's a holiday. It's a romantic dinner.<n>Output: Reason : 1. The keyword is _ quality time_.<n><n>A wedding, a birthday, a holiday are all social events that involve quality time.  <n>Romantic dinner or romantic date does not involve quality time <n>2. This option means two 2 options - either it is going to be a celebration kind of birthday wedding, or there is not going to be any celebration at all - just a quality time.<n>Input:Which of these is the correct order of events, if given in the right order? Choices: I: A: Make a sandwich. Get the money. Go outside B: Get the money. Make A sandwich. Go outside C: Get the money. Go inside. Make the sandwich D: Go inside. Get the money.

Choices:  A: geography B: history studies C: math D: religion E: dancing<n>Output:		Reason:Geography is related to science and history studies is related to humanities. So the output should be 'E': dancing.<n>It’s tempting to say that “math” is the correct answer, but it isn’t. Mathematics is something done in school, but the word is also sometimes used as a general verb for calculating and figuring something out. In this light, math could describe the work that the scientist is doing right now.<n>The word “do” is ambiguous. It could mean “perform” or just “work on.” If it’s “perform” then “Math” works. Otherwise, it’s “Dancing”<n><n>Input:When he was not working he was busy dancing, playing music or enjoying his favourite sport. Choices:  A 1: dancing B 2: basketball C 3: volleyball D 4: baseball E 5: golf<n>Output: Reason 1:The options which have the letter's 'D', 'B', 'V', 'S' are wrong answer.<n><n>The main clue is in "when he was not working", which suggests he was free from his job, indicating the correct options would be ones which he enjoys - so the answer would be between A and E.<n>However, to eliminate the incorrect options we need to find out the key letter in the answer.<n>If the letter 'D' is the correct one, then the words 'dance','science/maths' should be included in the choices. 'Dance' doesn't appear in the options. However, 'volleyball' does mention 'volley' which is the word before the 'D', hence 'V'. Same for 'baseball' which mentions 'base', also the clue is in these extra word, which are'sports'.<n>Similarly, since E says'sport' which is a sport, the key clues are'sport' and'science', so it should have the key letter 'O', so E.<n>Now remaining options don't have the key, which is 'D', which is the only one which is left. So the answer would be 'D' as it doesn't have the key to be wrong.<n><n>Input: He was good at traditional science and excelled at social science which is a branch of learning concerned with the what?

There's no doubt one can become mentally fatigued from focusing on a task for too long, leading to distraction.<n><n>The only remaining choice is C: tiredness.<n><n>Input: A computer analyst finds the computer has a 5% memory leak. What? Choices: <n>Output:Reason:<n><n><n>Option B "hardware" (B) is a good start, but doesn't quite fit the context of this question.<n><n>In order for someone to describe hardware as having the memory leak, there would have to be some type of connection between the two (e.g. the malfunctioning part would be connected to the computer in some fashion). But as they stand, the computer is simply described as having a 5% memory loss, not as having a malfunctioning element within its framework.<n><n><n>Option C "software" (C) doesn't work either, because memory leaks don't imply anything being wrong with an operating system (the software running on a computer). <n><n>Option A "memory" (A) is the only choice left that can be used. It's obvious why a memory leak affects the computer's memory.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is D: Memory <n><n>Input:  A manager who has difficulty getting work done at 9AM may have what?

One of these options is to "distanc[e]" themselves from the partner after the act of "making love". This is not the case for the others, as all of them (except for option E) involve the act of making love.<n><n>Option A is incorrect as the person would have already fallen in love with their partner if they had "already fall in love". Option C falls short, as it does not answer the question at hand. It focuses more on the act of making love, rather than the reason.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What does a person looking for new things in life do? Choices:  A: become depressed B: welcome change C: thank god D: experiences E: pay bills<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Another example of applying common sense to a logical Reasoning question<n><n>The question asks what a person looking for change does. The options A and E are clearly out of place, since they don't indicate a desire for new things.<n><n>We see a similar wording choice in Option D,"welcome change". The use of the word "welcome" implies that the respondent is currently living a different state of life - in this case, they may be experiencing a depression, or are experiencing difficulty and struggle, but would like to experience a change. This, therefore, is not the intended response, despite it coming very close.<n><n>And finally, B is incorrect because it doesn't even use a common sense understanding of the word "change" as in welcoming. In this case, B is not a new situation.<n><n>A does not have a common sense understanding and isn't logical to be the answer. D is close but not the answer either. So, the final answer is C: Experiences<n><n>Input: Why do scientists want to make the world in perfect order? Choices:  a) it is beautiful b) they find it exciting, c) they expect to earn a lot of money, d) for the sake of their own glory, e) they think the world will be more fair.<n>Output: Reason <n><n>We see here that C is the right answer because it doesn't fit the context of the question <n>Even with the word "make", the question seems to indicate a world without the messiness and inconsistency of life, and therefore, in a beautiful, orderly condition.<n><n>Of the other options, A and B are clearly out of place because they do not align with the goal of a perfect world. The third option, D seems to be the right answer. However, they do not intend for that to be the case, but rather intend to achieve that state.<n><n>So D is out. What does that leave us with? Exactly that. B is the answer as the scientist thinks that the world can be perfectly organized. It is not a beautiful world or a fair one, but the one that he expects. He wants the world to be ordered according to their will. He thinks that if everything is organized according to their ways, then it will be perfect for them.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What often happens after a long day of traveling? Choices:  A: sickness B: motion sickness C: relocation D: jet lag E: fatigue<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question invokes the image of "a long day of traveling" - which can be interpreted as a reference to air travel.<n><n>Option "sickness" (A) seems like it could be the correct answer, as a common side-effect of air travel is motion sickness. However, it wouldn't make logical sense if the traveler is going to sleep immediately following a plane ride - what you would expect from flight sickness. This is why that's not the correct option.<n><n>Next, we need to narrow down the number of answer choices. <n>Option "motion sickness" (B) would make logical sense if the situation described is air travel, but it's not, according to context provided in the question. The correct answer is therefore eliminated.<n><n>Further,  option "jet lag" (D) is also eliminated from possibility of being right.  No matter what time zone the traveler is moving from, they will still feel tired after a long day of air travel - this is not an answer that the question wants to see.<n><n>Therefore, option "fatigue" (E) is the last option to be considered, as it can be deduced to be the correct answer based on the context of the question: long day of air travel = tired.<n>So the final option is E: fatigue<n><n>Input: What's something that an average baby would not likely be able to do? Choices: A: run B: swim C: bake D: read E: grow hair F: learn language<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Context:The question seems unrelated to the previous question. The options are not given, and there is no additional context to provide a starting point other than the question.<n><n>Option "run" (A) seems plausible, if we are to treat this as a joke. But that's not the purpose of this question, so that's eliminated.<n><n>Next, option "swim" (B) does not make logical sense. If it could be assumed that babies are capable of learning anything at an early age, there's no way to determine if they can swim or not. If this was the case, swimming would not be considered implausible. So we can get rid of this option too.<n><n>Option "grow hair" (F) is

Choices:  A: industrial area B: museum C: barn D: school E: office<n>Output:		Reason: The copy machine being old and outdated, making it very unlikely to be found in the school or the office. Also, it is not a likely place for museum as it is used to be. So, out of the choices, Industrial area (A) is the best matching answer as people still use copy machines in industrial area. <n><n><n>Input:  At the age of 30, this person decided to spend 3 hours per day on learning a foreign language. Choices:  A. Cantonese language B. <n>C. Spanish <n>D. Japanese language E.

Choices:  A: roof B: room C: floor D: apartment E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In the first sentence, the speaker introduces the context of the problem as a person "putting something" on top of furniture. That immediately eliminates possibilities that involve action on a room level, such as B and C, as well as options on the apartment level, such as D and E.<n><n>The next task, then, is to determine the scale and directionality of the action. While option "a rooftop" (A) may be physically achievable, it is uncommon to place anything on the rooftop of a building. In addition, a rooftop is a location, not something that is used to support furniture. This would suggest that the correct option is one that incorporates both the verb "put" and the object "on top of."<n><n>Next, the person might be putting something "on top of" furniture, so we can eliminate options that describe action occurring "on" the furniture, such as "on a couch" (B) and so on.<n><n>The remaining options are then narrowed down to those that involve furniture as the object being "put on" top of something. Therefore, the correct answer is "room" (C), as in "put the couch on top of the room."

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n>Output:		Reason:<n>First, we need to figure out what a performer is. We know a performer from a dictionary or the internet, someone who presents a theatrical production. For example they dance. they sing. they act on a stage.<n>Now, we know what a performer is, where do they perform? We can look at the other choices and answer that out. For example, Arena and Sports stadium, they perform where they get the highest viewership, and also in concert halls, where the performance can be heard with the least of interference.<n><n>So option D Concert hall would be the correct answer.<n>    <n>Input:What is the relationship between a "base" and an "item"? Choices:  A:"Base" is an item.B:The opposite of "base" is an item.C:"Item" is the opposite of "base".D:"Item" is the "base" of a "base" and its item.E:"Base" is the "item" of an "item".<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>We can think of base and item in terms of their relationship to each other like so (base, item, item, base). This would be like if we used the term top, bottom, bottom, top. The items change but the order of things doesn't.<n><n>Then, we look at each option and make an inference as to their answer from that.<n><n>So option A would be wrong because a base is not an item.<n><n>Then option B would be wrong because a word is opposite of a word if the first few letters are the opposite. Like a "base" and "item" are the opposite of "base" and "base" respectively.<n><n>Then option C would be wrong because if an "item" "is the" opposite of a "base" then it is the opposite of a base item. If an item item, then that item would be "item" base, or in our original terms, base bottom, which doesn't make sense.<n><n>Option D is incorrect because a base would be an item and its item but its not that way the opposite of what you would expect.<n><n>Option E is incorrect because there is not even really a word such as "base". "Base" has been used multiple times. We know this word cannot be an item since it is a word.<n><n>This leaves us to answer the answer we originally

Remember, the other choices are not incorrect answers, it's just that other common things that are a staple at birthday parties do not include balloons.<n><n>To narrow down the candidates, ask yourself: what kinds of activities are a staple of birthdays? If you said, "party" (B), "having a party" (D) or "celebrate" (E), then you're correct!<n><n>So, you have two correct answers: "birthday party" (B) or "to celebrate" (E)<n><n>Input: A good rule of thumb for budgeting is to allocate how much money you make what?

It may be the case that "rule of thumb" has a definition in the context of economics - but does that definition have to do with budgeting? It doesn't - think about it!<n><n>The answer is correct in that "budgeting" (C) refers to financial planning. However, budgeting is a broad term that encompasses planning money allocations to save and spend on expenses, not just expenses. <n><n>So, you can eliminate the choice "on expenses" (D), that doesn't cover everything that falls under the category of budgeting.

Choices:  A: hoof B: kentucky derby C: race track D: painting E: triple crown<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once again, understanding the context is the first step. Here, the options describe what type of commemoration the artist is creating. The first option is "triple crown" (E), a famous and significant race in the United States that takes place once per year, and is notorious for not being easily won. Therefore, option (E), which can be seen as a form of "commemoration," is not a type of commemoration, so it must be ruled out.<n><n>The second option is "painting." This also is not a particular commemoration, but rather a type of artistic representation of a horse or event. Also "racetrack," which represents a place that is used to race horses, can also be seen as a form or representation of a horse. However, a commemoration is always a specific memorial in honor of a particular person or event, so this too must be ruled out. <n><n>This leaves us with three remaining options. The most likely (in my opinion and experience) would be "hoof" (B), which refers specifically to a part of the horse's anatomy and is therefore a specific commemoration. But it is also unlikely, since the options also describe commemorations related to horse racing, and a horseshoe is not a part of a horse's anatomical, biological makeup.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer to the question is: hoof <n><n>Input: I am thinking <n>Choices:  A: of all <n>Output: Answer:<n><n>Now to some math:<n><n>- This question should be considered as an algebraic equation.<n>- The answer is:<n><n>- 1-x=1-x because that is the equation stated.<n>-<n>-<n><n>Input:Their eyes met.

In this scenario, it makes sense that he is looking for cotton balls because he needs them for some sort of craft project.<n><n>Option "south" (A) is more plausible than the other options because cotton is a type of plant that is commonly found in more southern parts of the United States. Georgia is located in the southern part of the U.S., but north Carolina cannot be ruled out either because it is located in the southern region of the country.<n><n>The option "north carolina" (C) is inaccurate because it implies that the man is searching for cotton farms in northern Carolina, which is actually located in the southern part, not the north part.<n><n>The option for the man to look inside his "medicine cabinet" (E), while it might seem plausible, would be to look into getting medicine or other supplies from the cabinet, not cotton balls to complete a craft project.<n><n>The last option is for the man to look somewhere in the "pocket" (B).

Choices:  A: stripes B: seat belts C: breaks to help stop D: tires E: radios<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first letter of A, B, C, D, and E starts with the first 5 characters of the word "AIRBREAK" or in other words: the car should have air brakes. <n><n>Input: The three bears were going ________ at home.<n><n><n>Choices:  A: out to the movies B: out for some food C: shopping and hunting D: shopping and dancing<n>Output: Reason<n><n>We can deduce that "Shopping and dancing" (D) is the correct answer from the following logic. <n><n>If we rearrange the letters used in the sentence, we get "BDASR." This is a common acronym used in medical and pharmaceutical fields to refer to "biological detection assay system real time", which means real-time detection of a biological agent. <n><n>As the three bears were going hunting, "dancing" does not fit the scenario.<n><n>"Shopping" (B) is also incorrect because the bears should not be at the movies, which eliminates this option, too. <n><n>So "Shopping and hunting" (D) is clearly the correct option, though the meaning of the sentence is a little strange.<n><n>So the final answer for Instruction A is D: Shopping and hunting.<n><n>Input: You are in line to go down a slide.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When a newborn's eyes open for the first time it will be the first time the ever? Choices:  A: tear up B: see light C: fill with tears D: be happy E: glass over<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again, the initial task is to understand the literal context. Here, the newborn's eyes are opening for the first time, so they haven't seen anything before this moment. So, the option "see light" (B) (since light is commonly referred to as "seeing" something) must be incorrect. This is because the opening of one's eyes happens long before they "see" physical forms such as light. Therefore, it would be impossible for a newborn to see light for the first time at the beginning of a lifetime.<n><n>Next, the task is to determine what the eyes do for the first time ever. The choice "fill with tears" (C) doesn't make logical sense, because newborns haven't produced tears during the first few months of their life. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.<n><n>The choice "tie up" (A) is incorrect because eyes cannot physically be tied up or bound by anything. <n><n>The choice "glass over" (D), while correct in nature, doesn'tactually mean what a newborn's eye's eyes "become" (a euphemism) at birth. Although it is impossible for a newborn's first time to be seeing light, it is not impossible for a newborn whose eye's were closed to look "glass-like" or blank; this meaning aligns better with the word "glass" in this context. The final answer is therefore C: fill with tears<n><n>Input: What is used for making candy apples? Choices: 	 A: hot cider B: melted butter	 C: apples	 D: caramel	 E: candies<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>We can discard option D because only hot cider is used for making, thus option A is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: A person who plays the harp is a  what? Choices:	 A: fiddler	B: piano player	C: drummer	D: violinist E: harpist<n>Output:Reason<n><n>The correct answer would be E because a person would be referred to as someone who plays the harp.<n><n>Input: Which one of the following statements describes a positive-sum game?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do people find bills with bread? Choices:  A: restaurant B: congress C: envelope D: mail box E: cheese store<n>Output:		Reason: Here there is a pun involved which i assume is bread + bill = bread roll.<n><n>The question presents a play on words, namely "bill with bread" - which is also called a "bread roll." Therefore, "restaurant" (B) and the other options which explicitly mention bills or the dollar sign (C, D, and E) cannot be used since they do not match the given context.<n><n>Only the final option remains, "Envelope" (A). It matches the context and describes a place where bills are typically found -- a simple and logical answer to choose.<n>So in this question the answer is A: Envelope<n><n>Input: Which has more fish: a bucket of water or an aquarium? Choices:  bucket B aquarium C: bag D: ocean E: bowl<n>Output: Reason : The answer to this question is:<n><n>The question is about a fish tank and a bucket of water (or sea water). The options suggest that a bucket of water has more fish than an aquarium.<n><n>If you remember the basic concepts of ocean biomass, you would recall that there are approximately 230 000 000 tons of the biomass of fish in the world's oceans. So clearly the ocean has the most fish!<n><n>So the Final answer is E: Ocean<n><n>Input: Which of these is not an animal? Choices: a: cow B: cat C: horse D: snail E: parrot<n>Output: Reason<n><n>All answers in this question are animals; therefore they cannot be "non-animal" (not-animalism). None of the given animal choices (A, B, C, and D) fit the condition "not-animal" - they are all animals. Even if you were to exclude animals that are mammals, such as a cow, since they cannot fly, there is still no correct answer for the question. Since there are no correct answers to the question, the only choice that is acceptable is "E: Parrot."<n><n>So in this question Parrot is the answer.<n><n>Input: Which sport has the most concussions? Choices:  a: Hockey  B: Football<n>C: Cricket D: Baseball E: Soccer<n>Output: Reason is that football is the worst one.<n><n>It was decided that

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can you eat fruit on a red bridge? Choices:  A: refrigerator B: engineering school C: san francisco D: tree E: market<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n>The first step in determining the correct answer is to break down the word "eat."<n><n>In order to "eat fruit," it requires ingestion - which is why options that don't mention inhaling, smelling, or swallowing are ruled out (like options A and B).<n><n>Next, we need to understand what a red bridge is - is it on a body of water? is it next to a restaurant?<n>It turns out that the red bridge in this question is the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge (which is, indeed, red).<n><n>When you cross a bridge, you are crossing a body of water, and, given the question, it would be reasonable to consider the option "eat any fruit on the bridge." This option has the distinct advantage of being more straightforward than that of "eating the fruit on refrigerator," which is not a "fruit" at all.<n><n>Finally - we can eliminate option D - we know it isn't on the refrigerator; we know from the bridge that it is on the ground. It does not reside on a tree.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is E: eat any fruit on the bridge<n><n>Input:If you want to see the king, where would you go? Choices:  i. on the road to the castle ii. on the road to her castle<n>Output:Reasoning<n><n>This question can be broken up into two halves:<n>Where should you go IF....<n>What will happen THEN...<n><n>So, we need to ask ourselves - where should go TO "see the king." We won't see the king by going to "her castle."<n><n>Also - on the road "to the castle," we must be on the road to "see" the king. If we are on the road "to" the castle, we are merely *intended* to see the king, but not *actually* intended to have a direct encounter with him.<n><n>So, we can eliminate options (ii) because it contradicts option (i) - it simply isn't "on the road to the castle" that we see the king - and it is on the road to the king in which we encounter him.<n><n>So that leaves us with option (i): we would "see" the king "on the road to her castle."<n><n><n>Input

Choices:  A: joke B: humor C: frightened D: fight E: laughter<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, we're looking for a word that describes why people laugh or feel happy, when it's unexpected.<n>The most common answer would be "laughter", but it's important to look beyond the literal meaning of the word. While laughter is certainly one way that people express surprise or humor, it isn't specific to the point where the laughter arises from an unexpected or comical situation. Therefore, this answer could be eliminated.<n><n>The next answer "frightened" (D) could be reasonable if the question were asking about what makes people happy when it's unexpected and scary. If that were the scenario, then "frightened" would be a viable answer choice. However, the question doesn't make mention of "scary" or "feeling frightened", so eliminating this answer choice is appropriate as well.<n><n>The next possible answer is from the phrase "fight for". But if it is a question about "what makes people happy when it’s surprising and unexpected", than it's unlikely they would be "fight[ing] for" anything. It would be unlikely to find someone "fight[ing for] laughter".<n><n>Lastly, answer B: humor is the correct answer as it is often a surprise and is unexpected.

Choices:  A: tardiness B: looking good C: injury D: vacation E: neatness<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Options "neatness", "looking good", and "injury" are irrelevant to this scenario.<n>"Tardiness" (B) is a possible outcome but isn't necessary - the amount of time spent on grooming doesn't necessarily determine whether a person would be tardy.<n>However, "vacation" (C) is a real possibility and would indeed be a logical outcome from this situation. That could explain why the man didn't come to work some days.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is C: vacation.<n><n>Input: One afternoon, the woman and her friends decided to play a few games at the arcade, the next thing she knew she lost her entire day's payment to the game.

D: she should leave when she's at the top of her performance 5. E: she probably didn't enjoy at all<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The reason for why the woman's game lost the entire money was because she tried to win the competition to earn more money. She was too careless and tried to impress her friends by showing how good she is. <n>As a result of the mistake, she couldn't win the competition anymore, and she had no more money. <n><n>Input: The teacher said "I'm going to give everyone in this class a project.

He hadn't gotten what he needed in a long time.  He was suffering from what? Choices:  A: addiction B: fatigue C: relaxation D: headaches E: over eating<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to understand is what kind of "what." It's either a noun or a non-count noun, meaning that its spelled with a singular form. In this case, it's a non-count n noun, meaning we'll need a singular form. This makes our options limited to "a headache" (A), "a fatigue" (B), "a relaxation" (C), and "an overeating" (D).<n><n>Next, to determine which of these options is correct, you need to be able to describe what headaches, fatigue, and relaxation all mean. A headache (A) is pain or discomfort in the head, often accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or light sensitivity. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, tension, food allergies, or underlying medical conditions. A fatigue (B), or tiredness, is a feeling of physical and mental exhaustion. It can be caused my a variety of factors, such as lack of sleep, overwork, depression, or underlying medical conditions like anemia or hypothyroidism. A relaxation (C) is a state of calm, peace, and tranquility, usually brought on by soaking in a bathtub, going on vacation, or having a cup of tea. And finally, an overeating (D) is when a person consumes too much of a type of food, usually leading to weight gain and other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.<n>Once you know what these different words mean, it's easier to identify what the correct answer is. In this case, the answer is "an overeating," as it's the only option that fits the scenario the best, "what he needed in a longtime." <n><n>Input:What is the definition of a cat?

Choices: 	A: dead B: alive C: dead again D: back home E: safe and sound<n>Output: 	Reason: Here, the question asker wants a statement that must be true and if one is to look at the question, only one answer is true and given: “The man’s house caught fire and he was safe outside at the time”.<n><n>Input:The question asked which is the best song? A:Baby you got it all.B:Hey there Delilah C:Hey there baby.D:Hey there honey bee.E:Hey there Deliver.Output: 	Reaning- here, the asker is very specific with the answers and in this question, I have not included “Hell” so it has to be "Deliver" as well as “Delilah”.<n><n>Input:It was a dark and stormy night, and it had a name. It was known as the what? Choices: A: Dark and Stormy B: Night and Day C: Night and Stormy D: Stormy and Dark E: Dark and Night<n>Output: The reasoning- If “dark and stormy night” had an “official” name, then it would be mentioned in other places as well, and if that’s not the case, then it would be a good idea to simply call it by its “unofficial” name.<n>As to the original question, that's not the correct answer. You won't find the phrase "dark and stormy night" mentioned in writing, although you may sometimes find reference to things related to it, like the "The Dark and Stormy" drink at a restaurant or "the Stormy Weather" song.<n><n>The correct answer is D (which is the only answer that isn't a clunky phrase).<n><n>Input:If I could only have one beer, which would you recommend I buy?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:After the guilty verdict in the killing the judge gave a speech, he told the murderer he was pure what? Choices:  A: wrong B: death of C: bad D: negative E: evil<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, the first step is to narrow down the options to the best option.<n>Since a murderer was already convicted and sentenced to death, the options that are death (B, C) and negative (E) can be eliminated.<n>The words "wrong" (A) doesn't seem to fit to convey how bad or sinful someone is. And the option "pure" (D) is also wrong because the person is definitely not pure.<n><n>That leaves option "evil" (E), the most apt description of what the judge did. The judge clearly thinks that the convicted murderer is evil. So the final answer would be "E: He told the guilty murdere he is evil."<n><n>## 3. Why should we always follow the instructions given in the problem?<n>I was not asked for answer, but rather to read the passage given at the bottom of the page.<n>What I understood after reading the passage is in the world of job interviews, there is some expectation from the employer that the candidate will know how to take a clue and solve the given problem, not just to spuriously provide the answer(s) he/she find on the internet that suits his answer.<n><n>The first one may also be considered as a test to see how candidate will react, if the problem given in the interview does not make any sense he/she will simply find it bizarre, even ridiculous, not know how to react and just stare at the interviewer without any expression in his face.<n><n>But if the answer is obvious to him that the problem is banal, he/she can then be confident and provide a simple answer, which he/she would have no problem defending by making simple analogies to help the interviewer understand better.<n>## 4. It was not so long ago, that some of the first mathematicians made a very big discovery about shapes and numbers.<n>I was not asked a question.<n>If they made a discovery about shape and numbers.<n>then to solve a problem of shape and numbers, the candidate should try finding a mathematical or geometric solution to the problem.<n>

Choices:  A: fraternity house B: bank C: big town D: big city E: building<n>Output:		Reason: A science fraternity house is essentially a place where people live while in college where as a bank is used to store money, a big town or city is where people live and big building is where a science is conducted. <n><n>Input: In 2006, the average American's tax what did not pay for the cost of government services? Choices: <n>Output: Reason : a cost of government services did not go for the average Americans tax. a tax is something you pay on and the cost of government services is where your money goes.<n><n>Input: You know what to put on a toast. The bread may or may not. what is it? Choices: A: cheese B: peanut butter C: jelly D: mayonnaise E: muffin<n>Output: Reason  The first option (A) is not what you put on a toast, as it says may or may not. Options B, C, and D are things you can put on a toast that are edible. The choice E is a possible food for a toast, but it is a completely separate option - it is the thing you put on the toast, not the toast itself. Therefore, the answer is E.<n>

A truck, commonly spelled with the "e" in the middle, is likely the best description of the word "lorry."<n><n>However, the description "refrigerator" does not accurately match the meaning of the prompt as described in the first sentence: "When many containers full of goods are..." This phrase seems to say that the containers "arrive empty" and are then "filled." "Unloading (A)" and "cargo ship" (B) do not accurately or commonly describe what happens to containers that are arriving at their destination - rather, it simply sounds like describing a common trucking process. Similarly, options C and D are specific to items rather than containers, so the best remaining option is E: lorry.<n>

Choices:  A: question B: dispute C: deny D: contradict E: refuse<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "refuse" (C) is a plausible outcome, but may not be the most correct answer. References could potentially refuse to provide information to the employer at the applicant's request, but this is not the scenario presented.<n>Option "question" (A) makes logical sense, especially considering that the reference cannot dispute what they don't know. However, it's the incorrect option.<n>Option "deny" (B) can be correct if there was some type of disagreement between the applicant and their reference, but is also an incorrect answer.<n><n>Of the remaining responses, the only plausible option is "contradict" (D). This fits into the framework given in the instructions - a positive reference would confirm the applicant, and a negative one would "contradict" their good character.<n>Therefore, the final answer is D: contradiction<n><n>Input: What is the number to the left?

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first part of the question is to determine where a microphone boom is likely to be covering a given event. This information can be inferred from the phrasing of the question.<n><n>A microphone boom would be a tall, cylindrical device that can be attached to a microphone, increasing its pickup range.<n>It can cover a wide range of events, from concerts and TV studios to sports games and recording sessions. <n><n>While it is certainly possible to cover a stock market event with a microphone boom (e.g., to interview the market commentator), the location is highly specific due to the context of the event. Here, it's mentioned "stock market event". This event can't be any given event since stock market events take place in specific locations, such as New York or other stock exchanges around the world.<n><n>This leads to option B: new york, as a correct answer.<n>Input: You recently purchased a pink sweater at the supermarket.

Choices:  Layers of filling sandwiched between bread A. B. C. D. E.<n>Output: The first task is to understand what a sandwich can be, in the context of the question being asked. We know that a sandwich is a type of food that consists of two (or more) slices of bread with a layer of fillings in between.<n><n>For the first answer, we can see that sandwiches can be made with layers of filling sandwiched in between the bread. Examples of this include peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, club sandwiches, and grilled cheese sandwiches. These types of sandwiches use "layers of filling sandwiched within bread", therefore option A is the correct answer.<n><n>The second answer is a sandwich, which is a simple, traditional sandwich with a single layer of filling. These can be made by "spreading ingredients

Choices:  A: open doors B: drink water C: need food D: annoy E: play<n>Output:		<n><n>The first option "open doors" (A) is incorrect because cats are unable to open doors themselves, and instead rely on humans to do that for them. "Drink water" (B) is not completely true. Although cats do drink water, they usually cannot open their own water faucets either.<n><n>"Need food" (C) is inadequate because cats don't really "need" their food. Instead, they enjoy eating it. "Annoy" (D) is again an incorrect option because cats do annoy people from time to time, but they usually also annoy other cats as well.<n>So, the only correct and suitable answer is "play" (E). Cats always play with toy mice, and sometimes even with humans<n><n>Input:What do people often do before getting into bed?

Choices:  A: movies B: opera C: theater D: lecture hall E: hockey game<n>Output:		Reasoned Out:<n><n>Sports stadiums and movie theaters typically have fixed seating, so they wouldn’t be considered bleachers.<n><n>Given Bleachers is a song by John Denver, it would make sense for this question to refer to an outdoor venue, like a baseball stadium, a grassy field, or a stadium for sports. But an opera house may also be considered a theater, so that could fit in as an answer.<n><n>Since a lecture hall and theatre aren’t outdoor venues, I would eliminate those answers.<n><n>This leaves the answers A or D, which are essentially two options for the same place: stadiums. However, A specifies where you can “sit down”, and I don’t see too many bleachers where audience members can sit down. Therefore, D would be the correct answer.<n>So the final  answer is D: a lecture hall or a baseball stadium<n><n>Input: Which type of exercise would the best for a person with arthritis, yoga, aerobics, bodybuilding or walking? Choices:  yoga aerobics  bodybuilding walking<n>Output: Reason out the best possible answer in this question:<n><n>Option A: Yoga, walking, or body building are all safe for an individual with arthritis.

Choices:  A: airport B: gotham city C: london D: city E: gas stations<n>Output:		Reason:<n>This is another example of an elimination method. Similar to the previous example, the question is focused on identifying an obvious answer that stands out from the rest.<n>The option "airport" (A), seems incorrect because a telephone booth would not be likely at an airport. It's a non-traditional solution that's not commonly found at airports.<n><n>Option "city" (D) isn't applicable because the question asked specifically about a phone booth being red, not just any type of place.<n><n>The option "gas stations" (E), seems a lot more plausible as the place to find a red phone booth. You could argue that there may be more than one of the four choices. But remember that there must be an option that stands out as notably different than the others. Using the elimination method, we can eliminate the other possibilities, and so end up with the logical and proper answer: "gas station" (E).<n><n>Input:  Can someone explain me how I can make the below image work for a tshirt design?

The question starts with, "Can a scientist use statistics to analyse the data?" This clearly indicates that statistical analysis is required, and so eliminates the other options.<n><n>If the question started with, "What is the best way to do X?", then a different approach would need to be taken.<n><n>Answer: You can ask the student to consider what type of information the question is seeking, then ask them to consider which of the different answer types might be relevant.<n><n>If the student then identifies the appropriate answer as Yes/No, follow up and ask them how the Yes/No answer reflects the nature of the information required.<n><n>Answer: Use the elimination method: (X)<n><n>Answer: One way to do that is to eliminate the options by asking questions like below:<n>a) What is the context of the question?<n>b) What do we know about the scientist?<n>c) What are the scientist trying to achieve?<n>d)

Choices:  A: empowering B: regret C: despair D: glee E: sadness<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to eliminate irrelevant words. When reading the question, note that we're talking about a person and a person only. Anytime we use the word'someone' or'somebody', those words are vague and can lead to confusion when attempting to answer questions.<n><n>The second step is to eliminate irrelevant choices. While feeling regret and despair both refer to the same idea of feeling upset, sadness is a more distinct and relevant word.<n><n>The remaining choices, empowering (A) and glee (D), are irrelevant to this scenario.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is C: despair.<n><n>Input: What type of machine uses an electromagnetic force, such as a hard drive?

If he takes the highway South and doesn't stop, where will he end up next? Choices:  A: oklahoma B: developed land C: united states D: desert E: mexico<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question requires us to identify the destination for John's road trip based solely on the given clues. Option A (Texas) is out of the question, because John lives there. Option B ("developed land") is also unpromising since there is no mention of development in the question.<n><n>Option C ("the United States") is probably the most logical choice because the question hints at John's travel continuing across the country. However, that doesn't account for his destination at the end of the trip.<n><n>This leaves options D ("desert") and E ("Mexico") as the two likely choices. By analyzing the given clues, desert land definitely falls within the purview of Texas and John's likely next destination. This means that the final answer to the question is D: desert<n><n>

Choices:  A: injury B: beauty C: late D: mistakes E: annoyed<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "injury" (A) makes little sense in this context. Haircuts aren't inherently dangerous, so it is unlikely that cutting hair for longer than expected would cause an accident or get someone hurt.<n><n>Option "beauty" (B) is a possibility, but it's unlikely that an extended haircut would have that much affect on the entire hairstyle. For example, say someone had long hair and got the haircut, and by the time they leave they are left with bangs. That is not enough to radically change their appearance. <n><n>Option "late" (C) is also a possibility, but it doesn't fit the context either. The customer may not be late if the haircut takes too long, but they are still looking at the clock, which suggests that the next available slot is already taken. If it was simply a late haircut, they are more likely to wait for the next appointment since they don't yet have to worry about inconvenient.<n><n>Option "annoyed" (D) is the only option that fits the context. The other options are implausible, while annoyed provides a simple and relevant answer to the question asked. That is why option (D) is the correct choice.<n>Input:  What would happen to your credit score when you close your outstanding credit card?

All other choices, particularly "bank at noon" (C), can be eliminated because they don't make sense to stand in under these parameters.<n><n>The only logical answer that makes sense to stand "in a line" would be to get a "good book" (D), since this answer would be applicable in any situation.<n><n>The only other logical answer would be "post office" (E).

Choices:  A: park B: motel C: corner D: bus stop E: store front<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>At first glance, there seems to be a variety of different locations to find trash cans in the city. But the phrase "a trash can" clearly indicates that a singular trash can is being sought after, and the options "corner" (C), "bus stop" (D), and "store front" (E) are all irrelevant because they are locations with multiple trash cans.<n><n>It's possible that this trash can could be at a park (A), but then two other options - a motel and a corner - would be listed as wrong answers. Therefore, these don't need to be weeded out since they're already excluded.<n><n>The last option is "typically," which is essential to the question and needs to be accounted for. But if you're asked "where" (without "typically"), you'd logically assume that a blank means any location or multiple locations. Therefore, "park" (A) is out because it is the only "typical" answer listed.<n><n>But this leaves us with one remaining option: "motel." The phrase "a trash bin" implies that only a single trash bin is being sought after. While a trash bin could potentially be found in the city at a bus stop, corner, or a variety of different locations, a motel is specifically listed as an option - and it happens to be correct! Thus, motel is the most likely answer and also the correct one.<n>So the final choice is motel<n><n>Input: what is the smallest unit in mathematics of measurement? Choices:  Answer a: the smallest atom b: the smallest number c: the smallest set d: the smallest distance e: the smallest fraction<n>Output: Reason;<n><n>First, you need to identify and weed out incorrect answers that are irrelevant to this specific scenario. Atomic size is a physical, not mathematical, characteristic of an element (A), so it is irrelevant to this question. A number may be the smallest, but in mathematics, a number is not a unit of measurement (C); it is merely a value on a scale. A distance (D) is also not a unit of measurement, at least in the context of this question. This leaves distillation (E) and proportion (B) as the only possible correct answers.<n><n>The next step is to identify the correct answer. Distillation

The question says June 2005, so the answer is 31 days. <n><n>Input: A man with 18 children and 9 wives Choices:  A 19 B 7 C 8 D 10 E 12<n>Answer: The answer is option E. The man has a dozen children and nine wives.<n><n>There is no need to answer choices such as 7 and 9, etc. Because the question mentions only the specific number of 12.<n><n>Input: What is the area of a triangle with sides 6, 20, and 12? Choices: 160 A 200 B 180 C 280 D 254 E 140<n>Output: Choice Option: D.<n><n>This question is fairly basic. Remembering that the Pythagorean Theorem is a2 + b2 = c2, one can easily get the answer that D is correct. <n><n>The hypotenuse is 20; hence 12 is added to one side that is 6; the answer will be 280.<n><n>Input: If 4 + 3 = 8.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do people do to pass time before they can use electronics when fly in airplane? Choices:  A: read B: passenger C: land plane D: fly the plane E: buy tickets<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A (read), as in "read a book", is irrelevant in the scenario. There is no reference to people reading in the scenario, and the scenario is about electronics (or, more specifically, phones and mobile devices), so option A cannot be the best answer.<n>Options B and D (passenger and fly), both of which mean "use the plane for travel," are also irrelevant, because the scenario is about flight.<n><n>The scenario itself says that people cannot use electronics, so any options involving that activity cannot be the answer.<n><n>Finally we are left with options C (land plane) and E (buy tickets). Option C is the only answer that can be a potential answer among the four remaining options. It is both accurate in terms of the content of the scenario and relevant to the scenario, in that it involves the actual flying process and the use of the planes themselves. Moreover, an airplane cannot land itself without the aid of the pilot flying the plane, meaning option C is the most likely outcome people would do to pass time on a flight.<n><n><n><n>### Note<n><n>I guess there'll be a lot of such questions where all you do is eliminate irrelevant options<n><n>Also you can just guess, it'll work fine, don't get too hung up on this<n>

Choices:  A: sleep B: feel more comfortable C: sweating D: blush E: cuddle<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The question refers to a person who is feeling cold getting warmer by curling up in a warm blanket. They will likely be comfortable and warm.<n>A is incorrect because this would not generally cause them to sleep.<n>B is incorrect because this generally would not cause them to feel more comfortable. <n>C is incorrect because being on the couch, which is generally warm and comfortable, should not cause them to sweat.<n>D is incorrect because a warm blanket being nearby should not cause the person to flush or blush. <n>E is the correct answer because getting warm is associated with cuddling.<n><n>Input:The man who invented the telegraph didn't want people to share what with him because he was jealous of him? Choices:  The government A. The telephone company B. His wife C. His friends D. His sister<n>Output:Reason:<n>The word "jealous" in this case means "to be envious or resentful of the success or good fortune of another." From the context of the sentence, it's obvious that the inventor isn't jealous of his achievements. Instead, the inventor doesn't want people to steal his ideas, "which he didn’t want them to do, because he was jealous, not of their successes or of their talents, but of their minds."<n><n>Input:Who doesn't like to cook? Choices:  Bosses C. Parents D. Babies E. Moms<n>Reason:The question asks who doesn't like to make food. Babies and moms don't make food. D is not the correct answer. <n>Parents, bosses, and moms like to make food. <n>Bosses and Moms are not bosses. They don't like to make a lot of food. Babies don't like to cook.  <n>So the correct answer is B: Parents<n><n>Input: What does a dome shaped thing look like?

Choices:  A: driving B: road C: getting tired D: accidents E: ticket<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to identify the concept that is being measured in the question. We want to know how "moving cars" can be quantified or measured. One possible interpretation of this data could be the number of cars in a certain area at a given time. However, it's unclear exactly how this information is being collected, so we can't use this approach to determine the answer.<n><n>Another possibility is that the data relates to the movement of cars, which could mean how many cars are travelling in a given direction or when a car comes to a stop.<n><n>Ultimately, the question asks what "moving cars" entail, so we have to consider all possible answers for the word "moving." Answer C, "getting tired" is not a valid choice because it describes a different subject than the word "moving," and answer E, "ticket" is not a valid answer because it describes a different characteristic of moving cars. We're left with answers A, B, and D as options.<n>Answer A, "driving," could refer to the activity of driving, such as how long someone was driving or how many times they made a certain manoeuvre. However, this is not a valid option, because it's possible for people to drive without moving at all. Answer D, "accidents," could relate to the danger of moving cars, such as collision statistics or the number of injured drivers. However, this also does not work because it describes a specific event rather than the activity of moving.<n><n>The only remaining valid option then is answer B, "road." This describes the geographical path taken by cars when they move, so it matches the original question and meets our answer criteria. So the final answer is B: Road<n>

Choices:  A: backpack B: bookcase C: office supply store D: office E: class room<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in determining the correct answer is to understand the context in which the question is asked. In this case, the scenario involves a student who has mislaid her binder in her house. This implies that it is either in a specific location such as "backpack" (A), "classroom" (E), or "office supply store" (D).<n><n>Option "office" excludes any possibility of the binder being in the student's office or backpack, eliminating it from the choices.<n><n>Option "bookcase" (C) and "classroom" (D) exclude the possibility of the binder to be in the student's backpack, removing them as the options.<n><n>Finally option "backpack" (E) could be a potential answer but "classroom" should be the correct answer as the word "binders" should be found at a place that the question refers to and this is excluded as an option as "Bookcase" is excluded.<n>So the final option is "Class Room"<n><n>Input:You are a chef hired to prepare a wedding dinner.

Choices:  A: carnival B: plane C: concert D: turned at night E: a penguin's bum<n>Output:		Reasonability:<n><n>This question is tricky because it asks about what "you are usually looking at," rather than asking specifically about what that object actually is. This makes it necessary to consider the context and intent of the question.<n><n>If someone were to ask you if you're usually looking at a plane, they might expect you to say "no," since planes are typically visible during the daytime. This eliminates options A and C. If someone asked you about a concert, they might anticipate you to say "yes," but concerts at night are usually not as common as those during the day. This eliminates option B. Option D is a possibility if someone asked about penguins in general or were talking specifically about an Antarctic expedition, but would be inappropriate if you had no context in regard to where and when the question was asked.<n><n>Thus, option E would be incorrect.<n><n>The most logical answer is A:carnival, since the blinking lights at night are probably at carnival shows, which are a common occurrence, and for which people typically attend at night rather than day.<n><n>Input: In my spare time I like to write poetry. Which of the following is the purpose of poetry? Choices:  P: to tell a tale B: to describe life C: to convey emotions D: to share feelings E: to educate others<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Although option "B" (describe life) can sometimes be used to describe poetry, the correct answer is "D," since this is the primary purpose of poetry. Poetry is designed to convey feelings and provide insight into the author's experiences.<n><n>Input: During the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, how many Americans lived in small cities under 10,000?

That meant that the only time to leave was when? Choices:  A: early morning B: day time C: night D: afternoon E: daytime<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Eliminate options B, C and D by ruling out times that Sarah could have been at home that night.<n>For example, the morning (option B) doesn't work because Sarah is presumably at home during morning hours.<n><n>Option D is also eliminated, because it mentions daytime. Since Sarah has presumably been home all evening, she would not be able to leave for a daytime excursion.<n><n>Let's examine option A (early morning). The scenario suggests a time when Sarah leaves her home. Therefore, "early morning" wouldn't apply, because it is a time when she would be at home.<n><n>Option E is the answer because the only time for Sarah to leave would be in the night when she is at home.<n><n>So if we connect all the dots above, the following is our reasoning:<n><n>   1) The question says that Sarah thought she had been at home all evening.  <n>   2) Therefore, Sarah would have been at home all times other than a night excursion.<n>   3) Therefore, the only time to leave would be during a night when she is at her home.<n>   4) We've reasoned that the only time to for Sarah to leave her home is at the night. <n>   5) Therefore, Early morning is the correct choice.<n><n>So, the final answer is A: early morning<n>

Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question is a type of trick question known as a "reverse question". A "reverse question" is a question that is worded in a way that seems to suggest one answer, but actually refers to another answer.<n><n>For example, what would be expected from a competent student when it comes to their school work? Option B, "passing grade", may seem like the obvious answer; after all, a competent student would want to get a good grade, would they not?<n>However, the phrase "passing grade" refers to a lower expectation, as a passing grade is considered the minimum requirement for passing a course. As such, it doesn't make sense to expect a passing grade from someone who is competent in their schoolwork.<n><n>The other answer choices - A, B, C, and D - all refer to higher expectations (at least in the context of a school setting).<n>While it's not wrong to expect any of these outcomes, a person who is truly competent in their school subjects would have a higher bar.<n>That's why the correct answer is D: avoid pain.<n><n>Input: What is the advantage of the "for" loop in a language such as Python?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What preposition do you use if you want to combine two words? Choices:  A: article B: adjective C: interjection D: conjunction E: pronoun<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The word to be combined is called "appositive".<n><n>The functioning of prepositions can be summarized as:<n><n>Ex: The car runs on gas.<n><n>Gas does not work as a preposition, but there is an appositive relationship between "the car" and "gas". These two items are equivalent in meaning to one another.<n><n>Ex: The apples were red.<n><n>"Apples" does function as a preposition, though "red the apples" and "the red apples" form complete sentences. "red", in particular, does not function as a preposition; hence, it is not needed in the context of the sentence.<n><n><n>As such, you should combine two words only if they serve the same purpose (in which case preposition will serve).<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where in your home would you store birth control pills near your toothpaste? Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: chemist's shop C: kitchen D: drug store E: bedroom<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to do here is to get some context about what's happening in the scenario. We can see the lab results have been produced, and the scientist wants to search for what. We know this is part of a research study of some sort.<n><n>The next step is to determine what it might mean to "search for what" when it comes to the results. The study probably has something to do with birth control, which would provide some insight into what the study might be.<n><n>Comparing that to the given context about searching for birth control pills in an examination of toothpaste, we can see that this would make the most sense.<n>The phrase "next to the dentist"? Not so much. It indicates we are talking about a physical location, which makes little sense when discussing data analysis.<n>Therefore the most accurate answer to this question is B: chemist' s shop.<n>This choice is also most in line with what the actual meaning and context of the phrase "next to" is likely to refer to - the place in which the item is found.<n>The phrase "near to" would have a different connotation that would make the second-choice option of the dentist's office make more sense.<n><n>### Output Instruction:<n><n>Input: <n><n>### Difficulty: <n>Medium<n><n>### Duration: <n>5 MINS<n><n>### Notes: <n>

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where should you find a school in? Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: mosque C: every city D: prague E: community<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A, residential neighborhood:<n>In the question, the context is a parent explaining to their child why a school is important. In the residential neighborhood, a parent can enroll their child in a school. But this doesn't make sense, because students aren't allowed to enroll in a school (unless they're already attending a school), until it's located in their neighborhood.<n><n>Option B, mosque:<n>In the question context, a school is explained to be located in various places, including a mosque. It's not clear whether the author is trying to explain the religious context of schools, or the location for a school. <n><n>Option C, every city:<n>This is a confusing option to interpret. In order for a child to find a school in every city, they have to be enrolled in multiple schools. There's a possibility that they can move around the world, taking their school everywhere with them. However, this is not realistic for a child that may be homeschooled. <n><n>Option D, prague:<n>This doesn't fit the context of a parent explaining to their children why school is important. Prague is a world-renowned city in the Czech Republic, and is most likely the child's hometown (if they're of Czech nationality).<n><n>By dismissed Option A & B, the remaining options are A, C, D and E.<n>Though, E doesn’t make sense. "Community" isn't an actual location. The other options (C,D,E) all refer to locations of schools across the world. The question is asking about the school's location. But communities and cities are general terms that are used to describe places that school can be found. Therefore, the final answer is C: communities<n><n>Input: What are the most common way to start your day? Choices:  a) by listening to news b) by reading a review c) by watching a news show d) by writing an article e) by reading a book <n>Output: reasoning:<n>Option A by listening a news:<n>In the questioning text, there’s an obvious reference to this phrase. The author is attempting to describe how the day starts by saying “start my day”, which is also a cliché phrase about waking up first in the morning.<n><n>Option B by reading
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is a notebook often purchased? Choices:  A: bookstore B: backpack C: abraham lincoln's grave D: desktop E: classroom<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First, decide which option is most relevant to the context. <n>There is a reason for the query, a person is looking for a specific place to buy a notebook.  The options offered here would be unlikely to be a person's first suggestion, especially "classroom" (E).  There's no need to find a location where notebooks are for sale - there is almost certainly a local store nearby.<n><n>Next, ask which of the other options most closely relate to where notebooks are actually purchased.  The answer that best correlates to the context is "bookstore."  Not only is it a typical place where one would buy a notebook, but it also represents the closest option that actually fits the criteria. <n><n>The final task is to assess how well each of the other answer choices fit the context.  The other options do not hold water when held up against "bookstore" (A). <n><n>A person is likely looking to purchase a notebook, so the option "abraham lincoln's Grave" (D) doesn't fit the context, no one goes to a grave looking to buy something.<n><n>The option "desk top" (B) is also incorrect.  Not only is it irrelevant, but it would be physically unrealistic to purchase a notebook from a desktop. <n><n>The same goes for B.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is B: Bookstore<n> <n>Input:Another good quality of a good programmer is what? Choices: A: good grammar B: good reading skills C: good communicating skills D: good creativity E: all of the above<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Analyze each answer choice to determine which one best fits the context:<n>The question here appears to be asking about programming skills.  It's important to note that the answer will not necessarily be one of the skills mentioned in this question: "good grammar", "good reading skills", "good communicating skills.  The skills are merely an indicator of the types of skills that are important to have. <n><n>Annotating the given answer choices further highlights this, as there are many skills that would qualify as "good skills". <n><n>Therefore, look for any answer choice that directly matches the context of "quality of programmers" in the context of programming. <n><n>This narrows the options down to

Choices:  A: deadly B: dangerous C: unconcerned D: stressful E: harder when weather bad<n>Output:		Reason: The driver is operating with a high level of danger, which would undoubtedly create a stressful environment. The driver was driving too fast on an ice road, which is clearly dangerous. Hence the answer would be D: stressful<n><n>

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What has happened to a person's money after he or she has used the last of it? Choices:  A: dissipate B: flown C: disintegrate D: fall apart E: penultimate<n>Output:		What:What happened<n>Reasoning:The first step is to understand words that might seem out of place. The word "penultimate" (E) is defined as "second to the last" or "next to last".<n><n>The next step is determining how the choices are being applied. Choice "flown" (B) is a noun that refers to money, so "what has happened to a person’s money after she has used the last if it?" would be logical. Choice "dissipate" (A) is a verb that refers to the dispersal of something, so "what has dissipate after a person has used the last of money?" would be appropriate.<n><n>That leaves us with choices "fall apart", "disintegrate", and "penultimate". <n><n>Choice "fall apart" (D) is used when something falls and breaks apart; however, "she has used her last bit of money", meaning "all of it". Therefore, this isn't a possibility.<n><n>Choices "disintegrate" (C) and "penultimate" are both adjectives that describe something. Therefore, "what has disintegrated?" or "what has penultimated?" would also be logical.<n>Based on the context of the sentence, however, the word "penultimate", which is used to replace something that has been used up, would be the most applicable choice.  <n><n>So the result is E: penultimate

Choices:  A: city B: downtown C: own house D: bar E: shopping center<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question asks us to determine the correct location, and the answer is the word that indicates a place that has multiple things we can buy.  While it is possible to eat in a bar (C), it is more common to eat in a restaurant (D), which is another option. Similarly, while we can buy things like furniture and groceries in a shopping mall, it is more common to buy them in a market (A, E).<n><n>So "bar" is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: There was a big storm, that brought a lot of rain. Which of the following does NOT correctly describes a result of the big storm? Choices: <n><n>The city flooded (A)<n>They found a new source of energy (B)<n>They didn't clean the dishes right (C)<n>They had to cancel the picnic (D)<n>They did not build a bridge for the animals to cross (E)<n><n>Output: Reason and Explanation<n><n>Let's analyze each option below: -Option A is correct. There are no other options that accurately describe the result of a storm. -Option B does not make sense because storms are often described in terms of damage caused by the weather. -Option C is not correct because storms do not cause people to forget to clean dishes. -Option D is correct because storms can cause events to be cancelled. -Option E is correct because storms typically do not involve building bridges for animals to cross. All of the above reasons point toward B as the correct option. <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below with ONE WORD or NAME A ONE PART of an animal that can’t move.

The word "arm" can be derived and used from the phrase "arm can not move". The word "arm" is a part of animals that is usually not used and cannot move.<n><n>Option B is incorrect. The word "hand" is a part of the arm, but "moving arm" can not move either.<n><n>Option C is incorrect. The

Choices:  A: pudding B: get news C: strain D: answer E: though<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question asks two things.<n><n>First, there's an image of a piece of mail in the scenario. This implies that the scenario, in some unspecified way, involves a letter arriving for someone. Therefore, it's most plausible that the letter was written by a friend of that person. This may be deduced by using some form of communication, such as a letter.<n><n>But this letter, in particular, is assumed to be a letter from a friend. And so, the most logical answer to the question "why might I read it?" would be because it's from a friend. This makes option (D) the most logical choice by default.<n><n>Answer the following multiple choice questions<n><n>Input:How would I know if a piece of glass is clean? Choices:  a: by smelling b: by tasting c: by touch d: by color E: to see<n>Output:Reason:<n>I would think you would have to see how clean to answer this question. Smell tasting or touch would be pretty useless way of knowing if something is clean. But maybe these people have a way to clean that leaves no visible film that would cause people to know it was clean when they feel it?<n>That would be the main thing that would make me doubt an answer on this question<n><n>Input:Why did you buy me that?

Choices:  A: great granddad's house B: family picture book C: brother's house D: family tree E: family reunion<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in this problem would be to identify the context of the conversation. The sentences suggest that James is speaking to someone, either telling them him a story or asking for their advice.<n><n>The next step would be to listen for the action that person is participating in. In this case, we see that they are traveling somewhere together, which leads one to wonder: Who are they traveling with?<n>The answer is "his niece", the woman who is currently sitting with him. In order to get to his niece's father, James had to first travel to her brother's house.<n>The final answer is D: family tree, because the conversation ends with "they stopped by their cousin's house on their way to Great Granddad's house".<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What could you buy in a bookstore? Choices:  A: carpeting B: magazines C: strip mall D: city E: applesauce<n>Output:		The correct answer is "D", as the sentence clearly states: the things you can buy at a bookstore include: "magazines" and "strip malls". And of course, books.<n><n>Input:I will be with him in his apartment at five o'clock. Choices:  A; two o'clock B; five thirty C; eleven A: D:<n>Output: The correct the answer is "C" because it is clear that he will only see the boy at ten o'clock at MOST, since even if he arrives early enough, he will still be left alone for thirty minutes until five o'clock.<n><n>Input: How much time does it take to travel from Paris to Rome? Choices:  H: L: S: I: N: O:  Eight hours<n>Output: The correct option here is "L", according to Google maps, the duration of the trip of an average European plane is about seven hours and forty minutes.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Some stores trick women to buy products, the sales make it seem like if you buy more you what? Choices:  A: get money B: pay money C: go shopping D: lose money E: save money<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>After narrowing the list to the first four choices A - D, we can reason that these choices are not logical.<n><n>Option A: The ad states that if you buy more, you "get something", as opposed to getting something else. The wording doesn't seem to make much sense.<n><n>Option B: "You will pay more money" sounds illogical when comparing it to the wording of A.<n><n>Options C and D are both similar to A and B, where they state that if you buy more of the product, "you save more money" or "you save some money", respectively. These options are still not logical, as the question asks for the reason behind buying.<n><n>Therefore, we are left with "losing money" (E), which seems like the only logical response.<n><n>So the final answer to this question would be E.<n><n>##### Notes:<n>1.If it looks too good to be true...<n>2.The idea is to find the purpose and the main objective.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What does god want people to do for money? Choices:  A: work in life B: speak to people C: everywhere D: sitting ideal E: care for people<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This answer does not meet the standards for this question; it does not answer the question asked. Option "care for people" (E) seems to answer the question directly, stating what god wants people to do with money. However, option "ideal" (D) would be the ideal choice. Including a period within option "ideal" indicates that it's complete and finished, which makes it more likely to be the correct answer choice.<n><n>Input: When a person dies, does god want him to be eulogized? Choices: 	A: no B: yes<n>Output: Reason for the answe:Reason:<n><n>This answer is vague and could be answered in a variety of different ways. The question does not mention whether this is a personal preference, or whether it's a requirement for this particular situation. It is unclear if the word "no" excludes an eulogy, or if it means that god doesn't want a eulogy at all. This option also uses the word "him", which could refer to the individual who has just died, or someone else. Since we don't know for sure, we can't eliminate any specific answers.<n><n>Input: Which is better for a person to study: 1) AI or B): mathematics? Choices:A: AI B: mathematics<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Option A: "AI" is the incorrect response, as the correct response is "mathematics". The phrasing "better for a person to study" indicates that this is an instruction - where AI must be studied in order to be successful. "Better" would describe an instruction to study mathematics and is therefore a more likely answer choice than simply to study it.<n><n>Input:What do you call a group of two or more people eating dinner together at a table? Choices: <n>1) A: a meal 2)B: a feast 3)c: a luncheon. 4)D: an assembly. 5) E: a family. 6):a get together<n>Output: Reason of the answe:<n><n>5)E: a family. The correct response is "a family".

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is the result of instituting civil action? Choices:  A: bad feelings B: confusion C: going to court D: hurt feelings E: sandwiches<n>Output:		Reason: This question also requires contextual analysis. The options are all related to civil action, meaning a court case. The choices here are B) confusion, C) hurt feelings, and D) sandwiches.<n><n>"Confusion" (B) can be eliminated as it is an undefined term with no connection to civil action. The wording "instituting civil action" refers to some type of dispute settlement, and it therefore doesn't make sense to expect confusion as a consequence of this.<n><n>Then, when we evaluate the remaining choices the question becomes even more confusing. While civil action can potentially produce feelings of hurt, it is more closely related to legal disputes than social affairs. Therefore, the answer would have to be B) confusion<n><n>So the final answer for this question is B: confusion.<n><n>Input:Why do we find 1? Choice: A: because it is easy B: because it is the square of 0 C: because it is the only number Choice: D: because it is special Choice: E: none of these<n>Output: Reason.<n><n>In this case the best strategy would be to focus on the question of why we need to know the answer. A mathematician is likely to say it's for "special" reasons (D), while a casual passer-by in a coffee shop would likely give you reasons A, B, or C.<n><n>The wording "find" (which here refers to "know") and "special" make it obvious that "special" reasons are best. "Because it is easy" (A) and "the square of 0" (B) can both be eliminated for being insufficient for "special" reasons.<n><n>Then after the remaining choices are considered, we can eliminate "because it is only number" (C) for being too vague. Finally, "D: because it is special" is the only choice that makes sense given the question and the context, so the answer would have to match the choice of "special". <n>

Choices:  A: houses B: bedroom C: istanbul D: open tress E: gym<n>Output:		Reason:<n>There are many options, which could come to each person's own answer.<n><n>However, the answer should be "gym" (E). Although the man may dislike getting out of bed, putting carpeting in the bedroom would make it more likeable or at least more suitable for the purpose, which is sleeping. Placing it on the floor makes it less like that.<n>Also, putting carpeting on the floor in their house does not help the man in any way to walk on them.<n><n>The question asks where they put the carpeting, it could be in more than one place, however there is only one answer, the answer choice that makes the most sense.

Choices:  A: fall asleep B: headache C: boredom D: relaxation E: sick<n>Output:		<n><n>The best answer to the question is "relaxation" (D).<n>The context of the question implies that the author is describing a common experience shared by those who go to the opera, so it is likely that a negative reaction like "boredom" (C) would not be common.<n>Likewise, "sick" (E) is unlikely to be the correct answer because it is too extreme and seems unlikely. Additionally, "fall asleep" (A) seems difficult due to its conflicting nature with the act of listening to opera in a public setting. The answer "boredom" (C) is excluded because the phrase "go to the opera" could indicate that the author sees the experience as enjoyable, so it is unlikely that he would choose this answer if he felt that way.<n>The only remaining answer, therefore, is "relaxation" which fits perfectly as a response to a question about a common experience shared by opera attendees.

Choices:  A: state park B: opera C: disneyland D: carnival E: park<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Since the event includes "disembarking" and "re-embark", it's a boat parade, which means "state park" (A) is the obvious place.<n>The options "opera" (B) and the "carnival" (D) don't hold water in this situation. Neither the opera nor a carnival would offer enough room for a large number of people to gather.<n><n>Option "park" falls flat due to missing "boat", indicating the park wouldn't also be a boat.<n><n>This leaves us with one correct answer left - "state park" (C)<n><n>Input: The teacher said to her students "you are smart like a carpenter but not as smart like an architect.

Choices:  A: ordering dog food online B: avoid eye contact C: feel guilty D: fall asleep E: blush<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A is not a sign of lying. There are plenty of other reasons why someone might be ordering dog food online, such as wanting to foster a dog or finding a new pet for a relative.<n><n>Option B: looking away would be a sign to avoid eye contact, which is an act of deception. However, this doesn't necessarily prove that the subject is lying. They might be uncomfortable, self-conscious about their appearance, or have medical issues that cause them to blink frequently. This answer is also inaccurate as eye contact isn't a sign of lying at all, but rather a skill required to be a good liar.<n><n>Option C: feeling guilty isn't necessarily a sign that someone is lying. Guilt can arise from any number of reasons, such as committing a crime, getting caught in an embarrassing situation, or just having a complex inner life.<n><n>Option E: blushing isn't always a sign of lying, but rather a subconscious response to emotions and stress. It can be triggered by a wide range of factors, such as anxiety, embarrassment, or even a desire to please a listener.<n><n>Finally Option D: falling asleep in the middle of telling a story is a sign, but is a more of a symptom rather than a sign.<n><n>So the Final answer is option C<n><n>Input:If you were given a gift of 10 red apples, and all except two were green apples, how would you know? Choices:  I would look at two apples and decide A: yes B: no C: all apples are green D: I ate all green apples in 4 days<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The question does not specify what type of apples. If the question had been specifically phrased as "if you were given a gift", rather than simply given in general, this would be a trickier question, as apples are not the only type of 'gift' that could be given. However, because the question is phrased specifically towards apples, it would be reasonable to assume that all given apples are of the same type.<n><n>The next step, after having narrowed down the parameters of the question to a 'gift of 10 red apple', is to identify the differentiation between red and green apples.<n><n>As

Choices:  A: sew B: create art C: express yourself D: sing and dance E: write<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>Only the lucky ones are the ones who get to do for a living what they love and enjoy the most.<n>Its easy to see that "express yourself" is correct, but you have to choose among A "sew",B "create art",C "sing and dance",D "write",E "express yourself"...<n><n>While "write" and "sew" are both common forms of expression, "create art" and "sing and dance" require more talent and skill than "express" oneself. The answer is E:"express yourself".<n><n><n><n>Input: How can you express yourself? Choices:  "Be yourself". A: Be yourself. B: Be creative. C: Be silly. D: Be friendly. E: Be yourself again. <n>Output<n>Reasoning: The correct answer is (C) "Be silly".<n><n>Being able to express yourself is a good quality. However, it's not necessary when talking to someone who's a good listener. A good listener is someone who doesn't say much. Their lack of speech demonstrates that they are listening attentively, which gives us a good opportunity to express ourselves. So choose this answer<n>

What sort of facility ishe most likely visiting?Choices:  A: Swimming pool - B: actors and actress-es -C: fancy restaurant. - D: gym - E theatreOutput:<n>Reasoning<n><n>Answer choice A, "learn more about," is a bit of a catchall. The scientist probably wants to learn something new about his research, but the phrase does not specify the subject of that learning. This can be confirmed by cross-referencing the phrase with the other answer choices. By excluding "enlightened," answer choice B, it is established that the scientist is not attempting to gain a spiritual experience. Similarly, by eliminating "better understanding," answer choice E, it is not about gaining better personal knowledge. This narrows down the possible answers and leaves the choice of either "learn more about" or "do math."<n><n>The second example focuses on Bob and his visit to a dressing room. The context of the question is clear. Bob is in a dressiing room because he is visiting a swimming pool. Answer choice A eliminates choices that would suggest he is visiting a different location.<n><n><n>Output<n>

Choices:  A: supermarket B: kitchen cupboard C: table D: flea market E: dishwasher<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key to answering this question lies in understanding the wording of the prompt. The word "even" in the first line implies that the collector items are not included in the category of items the scientist has acquired. The second sentence further narrows down the focus to what the scientist has sold over the weekend, which implies that these items may be his recent acquisitions or new items.<n><n>Furthermore, it is important to note that the items sold can't be considered collector's items. This means that they aren't valuable and may not be worth much.<n><n>Finally the last sentence indicates that the selling is not related to the rare plate, which means that "rare plate" cannot be an item that the scientist has sold.<n><n>Therefore, the most accurate answer to this question is E – The "rare plate" can't be the one he sells because it isn't mentioned anywhere in the prompt.<n><n>Input: What is one of your biggest hindrances as a programmer? Choice: A: Writing code B: Testing C: Debugging D: Sleeping E: Eating<n>Output: Reason A: Writing code is an important skill in programming, but it isn't one of the most challenging or time-consuming aspects of programming. Debugging and testing are more complicated and might require more focus and effort.<n><n>Input: Who did you go out with last night? Choice: A. Your best friend, B: Your crush, C. A new friend, D. None of the abovement.<n>Output: Reason B: This choice, "Your crush," is the most consistent with the question. The wording of the question specifically mentions a"crush," and this specific option indicates that you have a romantic or potentially romantic interest in this person.<n><n>Input: At the what, the cat sat? Choice: A) On the floor B) In the sink C) In your pocket D) In the box E) In the water.<n>Output: Reaction:<n><n>The context of the question suggests that the cat is likely sitting on some object, not in free space.<n><n>The choices "In the water", "In the Water" are excluded, because they don't describe where the cat is.<n><n>Choice "In the water", is also excluded as it

Choices:  A: giggle B: lie C: laughing D: chuckle E: smoke<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question seems slightly confusing, so we'll break it down into its component parts.<n><n>Firstly, it appears that the question is asking us whether a person would "giggle, lie, laugh, chuckle, or smoke" when hearing a joke. Thus, as option A suggests, laughter (C) is a valid and likely possibility here that would reasonably accompany the scenario.<n><n>Now, after identifying laughter as a plausible possibility for this answer choice, we move on to narrowing down which type of laughter the option refers to.<n>We can do this by eliminating the option's less plausibly fitting counterparts and focusing on the ones that may be more compatible.<n><n>This leaves us with the options "chuckle" (D) and "laugh" (E).<n>But of course, a chuckle is not a laugh. So "chuckle" is not the correct answer to this question.<n><n>The remaining option, "laughing" (E), would make sense in the context of a scenario in which someone is heard telling a joke.<n>Therefore, this is the most accurate answer to this question.

Since being charming would likely not help a person treat a serious wound, crossing the street is eliminated. The last option, "doctor himself," isn't a plausible answer either - though he might be able to treat minor ailments, he would likely not be qualified to perform surgical procedures on himself.<n><n>It is here that the option "visit relatives" (B) stands out - it fits both the practicality of the scenario and the concept of family support and care. The person is not able to take immediate care themselves, so reaching out to someone else for assistance makes sense. This would be the answer to the question. So the final answer is B: visit relatives <n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question 27, and your 25% will be cut out and lost forever.<n><n>Input: How can mankind avoid global warming?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What  might john order at an indian resturant on top of the space needle? Choices:  A: large city B: seattle C: curry D: clothing E: reservation<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to do is to simplify the question in the context of the question itself. Option A does not make sense because John did not mention any place or food that he would like to order. <n>The question has the prefix "might" to show that john is suggesting the options of ordering. The resturant in the question could be any restaurant but it is most likely an indian restaurant or food.<n>However, we remove the resturant "on top of the seattle" as a choice because John did not mention that part of the question explicitly while he talks.<n><n>After that, we can look through the list of options provided as a choice to simplify it. However, since the question does not contain option D or E, the choice B is the most likely option.<n><n>B (seattle) is a city or town in American and in another word which is what john order. Therefore it is the correct answer.<n>So the final option is B: seattle<n><n>Input: How do you spell banana? Choices: 	    A: a banana B: banana C: an amrican banana D: an american banana E: aan banana<n>Output: Reason   :<n><n>First, if we simplify the questions to ask the question we want to answer for example in "how do you spell banana", we want to spell it we need to start with the letters "b" and "a".<n><n>Then we make a list of all possibilities that "banana" could be. In this case, it is:<n>Banana A banana B an american banana C an american banana<n><n>Next, we make rules so that our choice (A) can be the most likely answer and other choice cannot be possible answer.<n><n>We assume that the choice B cannot be correct because it's not in the list of choice, therefore the list of choice is the correct one.<n><n>We also assume that the list of choice cannot be possible because we cannot spell with the list of list. If we want to spell with the list of choice, it still means the first answer is (A).<n><n>By comparing the choices to the list of choice and the rules, it is obvious that the first choice (A) with the first letter (b) is the most accurate and probably the most likely, so (A) is the answer.<n>

Choices:  A: drugstore B: hospital C: bedroom D: car E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question is an example of a trick question. While it seems at first glance that the options only pertain to medicine-related concepts, each option actually contains both general and medical-related keywords.<n>It asks people to find a place where you can only buy either a hairbrush or bandages. The correct answer would be both words are present in the options, namely the "hospital C: bedroom" (C) and "bandages" (D). The only option that does not contain both terms is "car" (E) - it only contains "hairbrush" (A).<n>So the correct answer here is C - D: hairbrush and bandages!<n>

Choices:  A: dimly lit room B: kitchen C: wall D: table E: birthday cake<n>Output:		The question is ambiguous because it doesn't specify the type of restaurant. Some restaurants may light dimly, but most restaurants use electric light during mealtime; the question does not mention a candle in the dinner. Therefore, the question does not ask for a restaurant with candlelight. To avoid this confusion, it should be specified.<n><n>Input:What is the definition of a monster? Choices:  i: something terrible and frightening that has extra powers, but not human A: a large animal  B: scary C: an imaginary creature  D: a small animal of animal E: a dog<n>Output: A "monster" is not defined by the amount of extra powers it contains, but only is "terrible," "frightening," and "not human." It is not specified what type of animal it could be and what is a small monster in the question.<n><n>Input How would you stop a madman from killing a scientist who was building a super weapon?

A monkey does not get a disease because its immune system is like that of a human. Humans and monkeys share almost the same bacterial, parasitic infections.<n><n>Input: Did the monkey sit on the toy or stick? Choices:   B: Yes, because a stick is a toy, the monkey is a mamal that

Choices:  A: attic B: basement C: art show D: church E: bar<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again, the first step is to clarify the context of the question by eliminating options that don't make any sense. Options such as "art show" (B) and D"bar" are out-of-place: a wine cellar is not an art show and a bar is not a place to store wine.<n>The other options "attic" (A) and "basement" (C), however, are plausible solutions to the problem. A wine cellar is often located in an attic or basement location, especially when the homeowner doesn't want the wine bottles to clutter their living space.<n>But "attic" and "basement" are in fact vague options: both could refer to a number of different locations underneath or on top of a house, such as under the stairs or in the closet.<n><n>This is where inference comes into play. Given the context of this question (specifically, that the wine is being stored for church) "attic" and basement are reasonable location options. But a wine cellar might also be found in a "church basement". This is the only location where the wine could be stored for any substantial length of time, since wine is a perishable food or drink. Therefore, "church basement" is the final answer. Thus the final answer are D: church basement<n># Input:what is the most popular brand of car in california? Choices: 1: toyota 2: ford 3: chevy 4: dodge 5: honda 6: cadillac 7: mercedes 8: hummer 9: tesla<n># Output:Reasoning: <n><n>The first task in solving this puzzle is to understand the options to get an idea of which ones are more likely. With just the word "brand" in our prompt, we can eliminate 7, 8 and 9, since these all refer to a design or type name of a car, whereas we want to know what the most popular make of the car actually is.<n>Another set of unlikely options include 3, 4, and 5, since California is on the West Coast of the U.S., which places automotive manufacturing in Mexico, Japan, and China. We are left with five possible options: one from Mexico (Mer

Choices:  A: efficiency B: getting work done C: marriage D: finishing up E: results<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In this case, "getting work done" is a reasonable description of the ceremony.<n>The "ceremony" is the actual process of making proposal, or the ceremony itself.<n><n>It's unclear what "being married to me" has to do with a ceremony. It's a weird way of saying "having sex with me", but nothing in the context suggests that.<n><n>Option "efficiency" (A) does not make much sense. The purpose of a proposal is to ask for marriage, and not to be more efficient per se.<n><n>Finally the option "results" (E) would probably refer to the outcome of making a proposal. If a proposal is accepted, there will be happiness (the results) but no actual ceremony. If not it would be an unsuccessful proposal (the results).<n><n>An "efficiency" ceremony (probably something about the efficiency of marriage) would not be the same as a "getting work done" ceremony. Thus the final answer is D: getting work done<n>

Option A: "pocket" (A) does not fit the situation, as we would not have expected someone to store a double edge shaving razor in their pocket.<n><n>Option B: "shower" (B) is a bit more plausible. Someone may store a razor in the shower, but more likely one would put it in their bathroom while doing their daily routine or in their dresser.<n><n>The remaining options can be easily dismissed. Option C ("chemist") is unlikely to be the only choice, as a person wouldn't have to go to a chemist to purchase a regular razor. <n>Option D ("drug store") is also unlikely to be the only thing someone could buy from that store and would probably be considered an overly specific answer that doesn't fit the question.<n><n>It then becomes clear that options B: shower (B) and C: dresser (C) are the only logical options left, as other people who might need to shave for work or use a double-edge razor would know where and how to store it.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: shaving kits and shavers.<n>            <n>           <n><n>

The other answers don't make sense either - "fullness" (A) isn't something people leave on the sink after eatiing, "bad breath" (C) would be a reason for throwing out the food; and "dishes" (D) is pretty obvious because they clean the dishes in the sink.<n>And finally, "breakfast" (E) is correct because "breakfast" is the reason we end up with dirty dishes in the first place.<n>So the finalanswer is E: dirty dishes.<n><n>Input: After school, the most common chore that children do is what?

Choices:  A: michigan B: lake C: tide pool D: nursery E: atlantic ocean<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here we have a question about anemone, a sea creature that resembles a glove. In order to answer this question, we need to know what exactly the glove-shaped creature the question is referring to.<n><n>The first elimination is to choose "michigan" (B), since there's nowhere in the world where anemone live in the state of Michigan. Additionally, "michigan" is not the glove-shapped state, so rule that option out.<n><n>That leaves us with the only remaining option, "nursery" (E), which correctly identifies this animal as a glove-shapd anemone in a nursery. As such, the correct answer is E: Anemone in nursery.<n><n>Input: How many fish are in the lake? Choices: 1) 452 2) 875  3) 6298 4) 6329 5) 6328 6) 3286 7) How many people were at the park?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where you have finished a conversation with a person what do you say? Choices:  A: open letter B: thank god C: say goodbye D: bless you E: listen to radio<n>Output:		Reasoned Out:<n><n>The context implies that the answer to this question is "what to say at the end of a conversation", and so the first task is to rule out irrelevant options. "Thank God" (B) would be inappropriate in a social context. Likewise, "open letter" (A), while sometimes used in writing, should not be used in spoken conversation.<n><n>"Bless you" (D) is a traditional phrase used to end a conversation, but it has a religious connotation. For the purposes of this question, that particular phrase does not fit the context. It is also redundant because the options already contain the word "end", and the sentence already says "the end of a conversation."<n><n>The only remaining option, then, is "say goodbye" (C). It fits both the context and the requirements of the question. Therefore, this would result in the only accurate answer choice.<n>So the answer to the question is C: Say goodbye<n>

Choices:  A: apartment B: table C: school D: office E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first choice is a place that is not a desk. The second choice is school, and it does not mention a desk. Therefore, the computer cannot be at school. Similarly, the computer cannot be in the office because it explicitly states that you would not put the computer where it is not - which excludes the office. Thus, the computer cannot be put anywhere except for a desk or apartment. For this question, the proper answer choice is D: office.<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The boy was too nervous to dance, so what was he doing progressively at the ball? Choices:  A: dance like crazy B: standing still C: wallflower D: stand still E: like dancing<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question first invokes the image of a boy who is attending a ball. Although "standing still" (C) offers no clue to why the boy might be standing still, it's the only possible answer that matches the boy-dances-at-a-ball scenario.<n><n>When the boy's attitude for dancing is specified, the only remaining options are "dance like crazy" (A) or "standing still" (D). They both indicate the boy's lack of enthusiasm for the ball - the boy is not dancing because he is not interested. <n><n>With the two options narrowed to "dance like crazi" (A) and "standing still" (A), the latter is the answer.<n>So, the final answer is E. He was standing still like a wallflower while the ball was commencing.<n><n>Input:During Christmas season, a sales lady named Maria went to the shops with her family. What did she do? Choices:  a) was shopping b) was dancing c) taking pictures d) was talking to people e) was selling<n>Output: Reason<n><n>From the description of Maria's scenario, we can infer that the answer can't be "(A) was shopping." In contrast to what the Christmas season connotes, Maria went Christmas shopping instead of simply going shop shopping. Similarly, we can eliminate other options as well. <n><n>From the context, we see that Maria's actions relate to the Christmas season. While it would be appropriate to talk to people as a way to enjoy the season, the other options "dance" (B), "take pictures" (D), and "sell" (E) all conflict with the description of the Christmas season.<n>Thus, the only answer choice remaining is "(B) was dancing", since "dancing" is appropriate for the Christmas season.<n><n>Input: What happened after the man left home for business? Choices:  he opened his office door (A)  he opened his office (B)  he opened the windows (C)  he closed the windows (D)  he closed the office (E)<n>Output: Reason <n><n>Early in the sentence, there is an indication that the man left home for work. There are three options that can be gleaned from the scenario -

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would happen to you if you are not good at playing violin? Choices:  A: happiness B: relaxation C: create music D: sadness E: loud noises<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>It is unlikely that someone can be good at playing violin. For option A to be true, one would either have to be really good at playing violin, or love music.<n><n>Whatever the case, option A can still be true. There is still the possibility that someone can be really good at playing the violin but do not like the music that it plays. In that case, option A would still be correct.<n><n>Similarly, option B does not necessarily have to be incorrect. The option does not specifically mention "you" being unable to create music. It only mentions that you will not be good at playing the violins, so the option would still be correct. <n><n>However, option B is more likely to be false in the context of this question because option A is already false. The music played by a violin is generally of high-pitched and melodious nature, which would mean that someone who is good at playing it would likely produce beautiful music. Therefore, it is more likely that if one is not good at playing a violin, it is more likely to have a bad sound than create beautiful music. This conclusion is further supported by that we already know about our situation that the outcome is negative (we will become sad), so it logically follows that our music is more likely to be in a bad state than be good.<n><n>Finally for option E, there are no logical reasons for it to be incorrect. Even if option A is correct, option B still does not have to be incorrect. It is unclear how being good at creating music differs from being good at playing the violn. In fact, it is highly likely that being able to create music is actually better than being able to play the violin, as the output of the music created using a violin has to go through further production processes, in which the music may get damaged or changed.<n>So option E is correct.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>You are given a list of numbers.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The fact the two sides were able to even reach tentative agreement was a feat to what? Choices:  A: accomplish B: make progress C: stop arguing D: do business E: concert<n>Output:		Reason: Option A is incorrect as in the scenario both parties have not been able to even agree on anything which is why an agreement with mutual understanding has been difficult to make the most out of it. Option D is correct as the statement refers to reaching an agreement out of a business venture. Option D is the best fit as it also describes the scenario best. So the answer is D: to stop arguing.<n><n>Input:The scientist wanted to know how far he could push the experiment before the subject's immune system would reject the treatment. Choices:  A. the amount it would increase his IQ  B. the risk of the treatment not being as effective as it could be C. the amount it would lower the subject's IQ D. the point where the subject would no longer need the experimental treatment E. the risk the subject might have the treatment rejected<n>Output: Reason of Answer: Option A is incorrect because there is no link between the experiments of the scientist and this scenario. In this scenario the scientist wants to know the effect treatment in the subject will have. Option B is incorrect because there exists a risk of the treatment not to be as effective as it could, as stated in the answer. The scientist wants to understand how far he can push the treatment. Option C is incorrect because there is nothing related to it. There is no relation between the subject's I.Q and the experiment of the scientist. Option D is incorrect because the subject does not need the treatment of the scientist. It is the scientist who conducts the experiment and the treatment is only prescribed to the subject. So the final answer is E. <n><n>Input:The newest model was better in every way. The fact that the camera lens was 80% larger was a huge bonus. Choices: 1. increased sales; 2. better sales tactics; 3. sales volume; 4. decreased price; 5. better marketing skills; 6. increased marketing efforts<n>Output: Reason answer: It can be inferred from the sentence that the statement "that the camera lens was larger" refers to the model. Thus, the word is in reference to the company's business. Option 1 is incorrect as the given statement does not refer to the product which a business can produce but only to a camera lens. Thus, option 1 is incorrect. Option 2 is

Choices:  A: fast food restaurant B: vegetable market C: ireland D: produce market E: dessert spot<n>Output:		Reason: Potatoes are starchy vegetables, so they're in demand in the food industry. As a result, the businesses listed in the choices probably use potatoes in their food. Option "fast food restaurant" (A), however, doesn't mention potatoes. That's because fast food restaurants don't necessarily have to use potatoes in their dishes, although some do. <n><n>The next option is "vegetable market" (B). A business known as this definitely sells vegetables such as potatoes and other produce, but it still doesn't mention potato use. <n><n>The third choice, "produce market" (C), mentions potatoes, but that means it could sell any kind of produce, not just vegetables. For instance, fruits and flowers can be sold too. <n><n>Therefore, the only options left are "vegetable market," "food industry," or "irish produce market," which probably does use potatoes in its products. Thus, the correct answer is B, "vegetable market."<n><n>Input: In 1751 Daniel Bernoulli published 'the theory of probability'. What was Bernoulli best known for?

Choices:  a: it's broken b: it has toothache c : that is because you are smiling d : it is a bad idea e : that you have a head but you don't have a nose<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The question doesn't have a clear context to work with, but there are two major clues that can be considered. The first is that there are two possible answers, which suggest the solution to be a logical one. The second is that the scenario is centered around a person with a pain in their head and face, and not any other bodily ailment.<n><n>The most logical choice out of the given options is the one that is consistent with the given context, which is "that you have a head but don't have a a nose" (E). It is consistent contextually, that when someone has pain in their head, and their face, then perhaps they have a headache and nose pain.

We assume that you could solve each reasoning task correctly if you could, but we will show you how to go about solving it.<n>Each reasoning task has a statement, one of which is obviously unjustified.<n>The first answer that you have to think about is, the woman had to give up seat on bus for elderly gentleman (I'm not sure what your story was). If the woman had to give her seat for this, she couldn't have been giving up her seat to her grandfather, unless she only decided to cut in front of him at another time. This would suggest that the statement that states she cut him off should not have been given up because of its obvious unjustification.<n><n>The second statement that you have to determine whether or not is the man who gave up his seat for another passenger who thought he would be giving up his seat for her. Since the statement says that it is an unjustification then it is not the man who gave his seat to her and also cannot be true because the only one who did give up his seat for her was the man who had been in front of her all along.<n><n>The third statement is another one that is not unjustified in your answer. You could use

Choices:  A: band B: music room C: college D: university E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>If this person is a student, he may not have his own room. In that case, the answer would be "college" (D) or "university" (E).<n>If you assume this person is an adult and has a home, you can eliminate "band" (B), "music room" (C), "house" (E) and "college" (E). The music room could mean several things but since this is a person, it is more implied that it will be called a band room. And houses do not have music rooms for practice.<n><n>You can also eliminate "band" (C) because bands generally perform outside.<n><n>The final answer would be E: the university<n>

Choices:  A: city centre B: lottery ticket C: maps D: street E: busy city<n>Output:		Reasoning:(1) What could you find at a _bus station_ that can help you?(2) _Bus station_ in the context probably refers to a place where you wait for a bus to arrive. Then the answer for (1) would be maps (D), because you can see where you are and where you may go. And what is the map made of? Yes, a piece of paper. So (4) _piece of paper_ in the last sentence refers to the same map we choose the answer "maps" for. Reasoning:(1)What could you find at _bus station_ that _can help you_?(2)We know "you" need help to find something in the context. (3)The answer to (2) is "maps".(4)The most important element of the map is _piece of paper_. So the answer of the last sentence is "piece of paper".<n><n>Input:A man goes on a date at his girlfriend's house for the first time.

Choices:  A: roman architecture B: whitehouse C: spreadsheet D: bridge E: pantheon<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Let's apply this reasoning to each option: <n><n>Option "A: whitehouse" (B) is misleading. The "white" part of the option refers to the building's architectural style, not its colour. "Whitehouse" is not a reasonable answer to the question, because the question refers specifically to columns of numbers.<n><n>Option "B: spreadsheet" (C) is similarly incorrect. "Spreadsheet" refers to a type of document consisting of rows and columns, as indicated by the word "spread." It does not describe or refer to the columns themselves. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.<n><n>Option "C: spreadsheet" (D) is also inaccurate. The question again refers to "columns of numbers," not the spreadsheet itself. Moreover, "spreadsheet" is an incorrect term to use for the columns themselves, as they are not in or made of a spread. <n><n>Option "E: roman architecture" (A) is the only answer that answers the question correctly. In this context, the words "architecture" and "columns" are used in the same sense - that is, columns in Roman architecture (like columns in a column) - so this would be the most appropriate choice.<n>So the final ansswer is A:roman architecture<n><n>Input:How is a person related to another person whom has been dead for some years and is not your brother, your sister or your father.

The scenario refers to a person who is either related to a "dead person" or the "son of your mom." <n><n>Option "B" is not plausible, because "dead person" doesn't describe anyone who is related to someone. <n>Option "C" is also incorrect. In this context, a "son" is the son of a mother, not a man. <n><n>So the final answare  is B: dead<n><n>Input:What did the professor who has taught for 20 years say to the two students who are standing in front of him.

The only other possibility is if it were not considered to be "evidence" and if it were instead sent back to the owner. At least, those were the only two possibilities that we could immediately consider.<n><n>However, "holster" (E) is not a logical destination for a gun and "drawer" (B) is not a logical location for a gun, meaning the only places a gun could realistically be sent to are the police station (C) and back to its owner (D).<n><n>### Solution<n>```<n>def solution(dataL=[9,20,4,8,11,21]):<n>    a=int(10**5) #The max number of students in any class.<n>    if dataL[0]>a:<n>        print("All the Students get first class")<n>        a+=dataL[0]-1<n>    b=int(1000000/((a+1)*(a+2))/2)<n>    for i in range(101,104):<n>        for j in range(i-1,i+3):<n>            if j>=0 and j<100001:<n>                x=float(dataL[i-1])/float(dataL[j])<n>                if x<=b:<n>                    return "All the Students get "<n>                if x>b:<n>                    continue<n>    if (dataL[0]%2==0):<n>        print("All students get First Class; and all get secound Class") <n>    x=float(data[-1])/float(20)<n>    if x<=b: print("All the Studens get First Class")<n>    if x>b: print("All students get Second Class")<n>    return int(input("Give Answer:"))<n>```<n><n>### [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solve-multiple-choice-problem-java-python/)<n>

There are a few reasons for this conclusion: <n><n>(1) "model" is usually used to refer to an object, such as "model airplane" or "model city". <n>Moreover, it is an adjective which is generally followed by a noun. For example, "The dog is a model pet." <n><n>(2) When used as a noun, it is usually a synonym of "example".

Choices:  A: run B: swimming C: calculate things quickly D: fight enemy E: urinate<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Similar to the previous question, the answer for this question lies in understanding the context of the situation. In this case, a scenario where one is full of fear would describe an intense and potentially stressful situation. This eliminates options such as "swimming" (B) and calculational tasks (C), which are incompatible with stressful events.<n><n>The next task would be to identify the outcome of the situation. In situations like these, one is often overcome with fear and panic, leading to a higher heart rate, excessive sweating, and maybe even a rash. This leads one to conclude that the final outcome is that they are wet.<n><n>Option "urinate" (E), however, doesn't fit into the description as "urination" is involuntary in nature and doesn't necessarily require one to be "full of fear".<n><n>The answer is E: urinate<n>

This is how you can eliminate options.<n><n>Now we have 4 left:<n>1. 59+34= 93 (correct answer)<n>2. 59-34 = 25<n>3. 59-(-34) = -15<n>4. (-59 + 37) = -22<n><n><n>The only possible answer is A : 47
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Though he was an adult he still stereotypical slept on a sofa bed in his parent's what Choices:  A: garage B: horseradish C: living room D: guest room E: basement<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>An important aspect to note is the context the question asks of us to analyze the situation. A sleeper is a person sleeping at night. <n><n>Option "garage" (A) is out of the question because it doesn't have any bearing on the question.<n><n>Option "horseradish" (B) is also removed from the question.  The term "horseradish," by definition, has no correlation to sleeping.<n><n>Option "living room" (C) is also out of the question. One cannot "sleep in" a living room.<n><n>Option "guest room" (D) and "basement" (E) are still possible choices.  A key factor here is to pay attention to the context. A sleeper generally refers to a person using a single-bed instead of a double-bed or queen-sized bed (the most common types of beds). Therefore, a sleeper has to sleep on a single-bed.  The word single often means a "person living alone."  This connotation leads to the removal of options C and D. <n><n>Now, the remaining choice that can be eliminated through context analysis is E. This is because the sleeper would probably sleep in his own bed (E) and not in the basement (E), due to the context.<n><n>Option D is thus the most correct because it's the only choice left. D: guest room<n><n>Input: When asked about his opinion he said he thought that if he was alone it would have been the best decision he could what Choices: A: have made of B: made a  of C: have made a  of D: had made a of E: have his  made a  of<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The key to figuring this question out is to first identify the question being asked. The word "opinion" can also be substituted with "belief" or "idea" in the context of this question.<n><n>The next task then is to identify what type of phrase the author of the question is using to describe his opinion is. The question is "if he were alone," the author is using a "counter-factual" statement.  This indicates to the author that he would choose _________ if __________.<n><n>The choices B, C and D can all be removed from the possible choices because they don

Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Invitro refers to the process of reproduction outside of the body, and "offspring" (B) is the logical word to use in that context. It would be illogical to use the word "baby" (E) as the offspring of parental reproduction would be the biological child of those parents, as well as a sibling to any other children they might already have.<n>Thus, the final answer is B: offspring

Choices:  A: wishing well B: kitchen C: hardware store D: garage E: utility room<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>For this question, context is key. The janitor needs to "get his pail out'', implying it's not in the same place it was when he originally acquired it. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B. These would be logical locations for the janitor to keep his pail if it was already in their possession.<n><n>The choices C and D are more ambiguous, but still lean towards a location similar to the origin. The janitor could've purchased his pail at a hardware store, so option C isn't completely out of the question.<n><n>However, option E best fits the scenario. The janitor doesn't need to go far to retrieve his pail, as it can be found right in the utility room.<n><n>Thus the final answer is E - utility room<n><n>Input:The scientist was conducting research in his laboratory, and he was quite excited about what? Choices: : A. a new microscope B. how animals are similar C. dinosaurs D. what he found in the lab today E. his new computer<n>Output: : <n><n>Reasoning: <n><n>The first question, then, is whether scientist is excited about discovering (A) something with a new microscope (in the laboratory), finding out (B) what animals have in common (both animals and the lab), or doing (C) something with dinosaurs (in the laboratory). These are unlikely options; the scientist most likely is not excited either about doing something with dinosaurs, getting something new from a microscope, or finding out something about what animals have in common.<n>With question two, the context clues point towards another laboratory-related object or event. While option (A) 'how animals are similar' could point towards what the scientist is excited about, we can also be sure that he is not talking about something dinosaurs-related. Similarly, option (B), while it's a possibility, is less likely than (A).<n>The option (A) 'what he found in the lab,' however, is a viable choice — the 'what' in this question must refer to the lab.<n>If it had referred to something discovered with the microscope, the phrase 'what he found in his laboratory' (as opposed to what he found in the laboratory) would be more

Here, the option "distinguished" (B) is correct; the other option, "excellent" (E), is not an accurate reply.<n><n>Input:Which of the following is a compound with more than one element? Choices: <n><n>A: sodium carbonate B: HF C: Fe D: CO2<n><n>Output:Reason:<n><n>This question requires knowledge of chemistry, specifically the different chemical compounds.<n>Option "HF" (B) indicates that it is a combination of one element, hydrogen (H), and one element, fluorine (F), and therefore isn't considered a compound. <n>Option "Fe" (D) doesn't have any given elements in it, so the answer is incorrect. <n>Option "CO2" (C) is a mixture of carbon (C) and oxygen (O), which makes it a compound.<n><n>Input:Hey, I have a cold.

Where might his connection be? Choices:  A: company B: airport C: wall D: computer network E: love<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The primary piece of information provided in the question is that James was delayed, which suggests he was waiting for someone or something in order to depart. That information immediately leads to eliminating "company" (A) and "airport" (B), which involve people and places outside of one's self. <n><n>Option "love" (E) is clearly incongruous with the given facts, as love and relationships don't require time apart. "Computer network" (D) is also ruled out because it would not explain James' delay, as connections and computers only enable efficient transfer of data. <n><n>The remaining two options are "computer" (C) and "wall" (D). Option "computer" is more plausible, as a computer is something James might connect to in order to use a network. Option "wall" is still plausible, but could refer to a wall of people or even a wall of a building; either of which wouldn't explain James' delay. <n><n>Option C: Computer would be the most accurate response to the question - James was delayed for a couple hours simply due to the act of connecting to a computer to utilize a network of computers to run an algorithm, a task James was delayed from completing due to the need to wait a couple of hours in order to successfully run the algorithm.<n><n>Input:When was the last time you watched television? Choices:  Yesterday A: week B: year C: month D: year<n>Output: answer: It was yesterday<n>Reason: A few options can be eliminated from this question:<n>We know the person has watched television because yesterday is the specific time he/she watched television, based on the given answer choice.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is the opposite of foolhardy? Choices:  A: thoughtful B: discreet C: calculated D: cautious E: careful<n>Output:		Reasoning: The correct choice here is "careful," which means deliberate and measured. This is the most opposite choice from "foolhardy" (as defined as "foolish or rashly confident," foolhardy). Although these meanings do vary from the dictionary, they are the best choice here because the question asks for the opposite of "foolhardy." The other choices on the list don't have negative connotations in the same manner.<n><n>Input: What is the opposite of the word perception? Choices: 1. intuition 2. interpretation A 2. interpretation B 2. interpretation C 2. interpretation D 2. interpretation E<n>Output:Reason: The correct answer here is "intuition," which is defined as "quick understanding or knowledge without conscious reasoning." It makes sense that it would be the opposite of the word "perception," which in the English language is defined by The Oxford English Dictionary as, "the action or process of perceiving, or apprehending sensory stimuli by means of the senses."<n><n><n>Input: What was the most significant difference between the first and second editions of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz? Choices: A. The Wicked Witch of the West was not featured in The Wonderful Wizard as she was in the second edition. B. Tin Man joined Jack of Clubs, and Scarecrow joined the Lion in the search for Dorothy. C. The Wicked WITCH OF THE WEST was not featured in the second edition. D. Tin Man joined Queen of Clubs, and Lion joined the Scarecrow in the search for Doroth. E. The mushroom field grew to the size of a pond.<n>Output:Reason<n>The only reasonable answer here is Option B. The Wicked Wizz of the West was completely absent from the second edition of the novel.

Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n>Output:		Reasonning<n><n>Once we eliminate the irrelevant options, all that remains are options B and E. Both locations have a line where people would likely stand.<n>We can quickly eliminate option B (military base) because we know the question is asking about a road, not a building or some other structure.<n>That leaves us only option E: "bus stop". This answer choice is the one that makes the most logical sense given the context of what we're looking for.<n><n>Input: What does it take for someone to succeed? Choices:  _________ A: a plan B: a lot of friends C: a fair share of luck D: hard work E: money<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The only relevant options are A and C. A plan suggests that more organization or strategy is needed rather than anything else — such as friends or luck. However, "a fair share of luck" still remains viable even after eliminating A. As long as someone has a "fair share" of luck, it wouldn’t stop him from succeeding.<n><n>The only way to know if the person has succeeded is to make it into the end, or the "finish line."  And the most logical explanation as to why someone would make it through is with hard work and dedication. Therefore, hard work is the appropriate answer.<n>Input: Where is it most likely to find a car in the city? Choices:  Wet and slippery A: intersection B: on highways C: a parking garage D: on a parkway <n>Output: Reason <n><n>We can eliminate all options except option D. A intersection is on a street, and we said we wanted a street with a car.<n>Similarly, we can eliminate option B (highways), because it wouldn’t be very likely we would find a car on a highway.<n>When we look at option D, which includes “a street,” we realize this is an indirect answer - meaning we could find cars on a street, but we couldn’t necessarily find them on “a parkway.” In other words, it’s more likely we’d see a car on “the streets” rather than on a parkway. <n>The final answer is "a street", because we can find cars most easily on them.<n><n>Input:  A: the man  B: the student  C: the teacher  D: the doctor  E

Choices:  A: feel sorry B: trust god C: cross street D: ride a bike E: lend money<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question involves identifying the outcome of an action that can hurt another person. The options provide several hypothetical possibilities that this outcome might be, including A) "feel sorry" and B) "trust God." <n>Option (A) is not supported by the context of the question, as the person whose action hurts another would not necessarily feel sorry for doing so. Likewise, option (B) assumes that the person has faith in the Divine and trusts them to heal and protect them from any harm, which isn't necessarily relevant to the question either.<n>Option (D) is not considered for several reasons.<n>Option C) cannot be determined by the current setup.<n>Option E) only states that "a person could lend money to someone else," not whether it is the intended outcome of harming someone else.<n>Option D) describes "riding a bike," which has nothing to do with this scenario.<n><n>Finally the question poses option E) that describes "lending money," which could be seen as hurting or benefiting someone. However, in this instance, since the sentence "They might lend money to someone" is in a conditional format, it is referring to an eventuality in which the person in the question may be hurt. Therefore, lending money is not necessarily the main focus of this scenario.<n>Option A) "feel sorrow" is not indicated as the intended outcome of the question either.<n><n>So the final answer will be E: lend money.<n><n>Input:I saw a squirrel!

Body strength B.  muscular power C.  brute strength D.  brains  E.  brain strength<n>Output: Answer: Reason:The answer is "A: Body strength"<n>Brawn refers to physical strength or power. It is commonly used to refer to strength and power of the body. "brawn" is a noun that means strength and/or physical size or power. The noun "brawn" most often refers specifically to the use (or misuse) of physical strength and power as opposed to the use of one's brain. This refers to "brawn" rather than "brains" because he will be using his strength rather than his brains. As a noun, “brawn” means 1. brawn, physical strength.<n>We can also get it by the sentence He said to me, 「I’ll be able solve this problem by using brain RATHER THAN 」, the keyword is brain instead body. Then, "what does brawn refer to?" the question is. Because it's not related to the key word. the "use of brain RATHER THA body" is not what is meant by the key word "brawn". The sentence means use of your BRAIN RATHER THAN BRAWN and the body is ignored.<n>Hence it is A not D<n><n>#### Testing my answer<n>Input: The instructor asked him to dance and he said, ―I don’t know how but I’ll give it a try because I need to have fun this year.‖ Which of the given sentences is closest in meaning to "give it a try"?<n>Choices: A.  to try hard B.  to try new things C.  to work hard D.  to practice hard E.  to have fun<n>Output: The answer is B, not A.<n>because B is the answer that is closest in meaning to 'to give it a try'. B stands for to try new things.<n>It is very very similar to the question and answer. The only thing is "work hard
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If a student was about to graduate, they would no longer be attending what? Choices:  A: library B: parties C: kindergarten class D: bar E: school<n>Output:		Reason: The main purpose of schools is to provide education for children. As such, they are more similar to other establishments with similar functions, such as libraries and kindergarten classes. While many people attend bars, it would not be a place where students spend most of their time.<n><n>Input:The student went on a field trip in a science class, what did the student wear? Choices: 1. 1 shorts 2. 1 shirts 3. 1 shoes 4. 2 shorts 5. 2 pants<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>In this case, a field trip would take place outside the educational institution, so formal school uniforms like pants or shirts would therefore not be necessary. As such, choosing "1 shorts" (a reference to a swim suit) is more correct than the other options here.<n><n>Inputs:The student went to a math class and asked how to do a problem, the teacher said that he could always cheat. What was cheating?Choices:1. 1. Using math book. 2. 2. Solving using pen and paper 3. 3. Using calculator 4. 4. Solve using a friend. 5. 5. Solves it in his head.<n>Output:<n><n>In this situation, cheating would not entail using a physical book or any kind of pen and paper. Rather, it would describe the process of solving the problem without employing any of these aids, even if all possible (since solving it in your head requires remembering the equation and performing the necessary calculations without any physical objects).<n><n>Input:The students were taught about a math equation. The teacher asked "what does this equation say". The answer: A: A equation that shows how to get B+C.  B: An equation that shows how to reduce D.  C: An equation that shows what to subtract from F.  D: An equation that shows the different of (A-B).  E: An equation that shows A and B are equal.<n>Output: Reason:-<n><n>The "equal" options are both correct, as they describe two situations where the equation is applicable.<n><n>However, the only options that include "addition" are (D) and (F). The answer given by the student should therefore include this word.

The type of people that drive trucks? The reason for the different smells of flowers? The secret behind the spices? How to catch a cat?<n>Output: Reason<n>The correct answer should be "What type of people drive trucks?".<n><n>Explanation: The correct answer should be "Type of people that drive trucs?" instead. The given question has only one correct answer choice which is given below, <n>```<n>What type of people ____?<n>A) drives?<n>```<n>Here option B can be eliminated first for two reasons.<n>```<n>1) Drives means to move or carry something by force, which is not correct in this question. <n>2) The question is to know the particular word about driving trucks.<n>```<n>But in this option "drivers" is

Choices:  A: field B: alone C: small group D: solitude E: solitary<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing that needs to be determined is the size of the crowd.<n><n>"Not that big" (B) implies that it was not a massive crowd, but it doesn't mention the size of it. "Not big" (C) is more suitable for this definition.<n><n>The final word choice, "solitary" (C), is a bit of a stretch, since the context describes a "crowd".<n><n>The remaining three options are all synonyms of "small group" (D).<n>Solitary (C) might be overstated, but when describing a crowded event, the word "solo" (I) implies an undesirable solitude.<n><n>Similarly, the word "lone" (J) doesn't really describe what's happening because it's too similar to "solo", which implies isolation.<n>The word "lone" might have been more appropriate in describing the location of one person, but not in the context of describing an actual crowd.<n><n>"Field" (B) also sounds too much like the concept of a field of grass, so it is ruled out as an applicable definition.<n><n>In conclusion, the most appropriate definition is small group (D), so the final answer is D: small group<n><n>Input:While hiking in the mountains the traveller saw a man who wasn't __________ any clothes.  Choices:  A. wearing B. having C. possessing D. holding E. making<n>Output: Reason is:<n><n>First of the important things to note in this question is that the question explicitly mentions the traveller and another individual that the travelling individual sees while hiking.<n>Secondly, the travelling individual does not mention anything about that individual carrying clothes with him. So the options that are out of contention are choices A and D.<n>Choice  E is incorrect because of the word "making".<n>Choice B is excluded because it is not mentioned in the context of the original sentence.<n>Also, choice C could be used in two other contexts but is inappropriate in the given context. The word possessing means that the man that the traveller saw is in possession of clothes.<n><n>From the options left, we can see that that the man has clothes on his body, so choice C is no longer viable.

Choices:  A: hang in closet B: sniff C: get dirty D: become soiled E: air out<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, the purpose of analyzing the clothes is revealed in the context of the question, which states that "clothes have developed a smell". Hanging the clothes in the closet and airing them out could both help eliminate the smell.<n><n>Option "hang in closet" (A) and "get dirty" (C) imply actions taken at a later time, following the original incident. So they can't be the answer to this question about how to handle soiled clothes right now.<n><n>Option "air out" (E) is a good way to ventilate the clothes and remove that unpleasant smell. So it's the correct answer to this question.<n>

Choices:  A: intelligence B: education C: effectiveness D: distress E: a stupid<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The most likely cause of the inability to learn is "effectiveness", because learning something requires one to be able to accomplish that task. <n><n>Other options like "distress" (D) and "effectiveness" (E) can also be eliminated because they don't make sense in the context of the question's statement. <n><n>Only option A, "intellect", makes sense and should be the correct choice.<n><n>Input:What is something that can tell stories? Choices: <n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>This question has one correct answer and seven incorrect answers.<n><n>"A. A book" (C) is the correct answer because it is the only option that makes sense. Books can tell stories, and it is not a book. Other options such as "a library" (B), "a computer" (E), and "your mind" (D) are too specific.<n><n>"A pen" (A) cannot tell stories, but can be used for writing a story.

Choices:  A: pressure B: death C: trying harder D: quitting E: winning or losing<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Wanted" refers to James' desire to stop competing, which makes us think he is resistant to it.  "Trying harder" would be appropriate in a different context, but does not apply in this situation.<n>"Winning or losing" refers to how James feels about competing. That may be the case, but the scenario presents him wanting to stop competing, not just how he feels about it – so the answer is most likely "Trying harder"<n>"Quitting" suggests that James would like to stop, but he is being prevented from doing so. Since James is saying he wants to stop competing, "Trying harder" does not apply here.<n><n>"Death" refers to the physical danger of a sport. But James is not in sports; he is a person and, presumably, a healthy one at that. So the scenario suggests that James has no fear of such danger in his chosen sport. That makes "Death" an unlikely option for what James is feeling.<n><n>"Trying harder" is the best option given the circumstances. It is a choice that is consistent with, or implies, James’s desire to stop competing. It is hard to imagine someone going the wrong way, but still feeling positive about the change. Therefore, the final answer is D: trying harder

Choices:  A: closet B: at hotel C: sidewalk D: bus stop E: trunk<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here the word “put” refers to transferring or delivering something from one place to another. Accordingly, the only logical answer is choice  “trunk ”. After all, there is only one place the man could put his luggage other from where it was stored; therefore, the man could not put the luggage into the front seat of the car. Choice  ”at the hotel” is excluded because the man was not staying at the hotel; moreover, choosing the hotel’s lobby as the place from whence he took the luggage and  to deliver it at the airport’s check-in counter also makes no sense. Furthermore, there is nothing in the passage that suggests that the man had  a bus stop or a truck. Thus, the only correct answer is  “trunk,” which he put his luggages.<n><n>Input: A woman had a friend named Alice what was her name? Choices: <n>A: Alicia B: Elaine C: Aida D: Adria E: Alice<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The first thing to check is the context. Because the answer is the woman’s name, there would be many references to her as “her.” Once the context of the question has been established, the next step is to check the clues in the paragraph that might help narrow down the answers.<n><n>Choice  “Alice” is obviously incorrect because the answer is the woman's name.<n><n>If the answer is someone else’s name, then it would make sense to include the surname. However, the man in the text uses the surname “Smith” alone in all examples of the man’s name, and these examples are in the singular. Therefore, choice  “Alice Smith” is  incorrect.<n><n>The man in the paragraph never uses surname “Dunn”.<n><n>Choice  “Elaine” is an example. The man always prefaces his examples with “Elaine Smith”. Therefore, choosing this example is incorrect.<n><n>Choice  ``Eleine” is incorrect because this name is never mentioned in the text.<n><n>The last name “Smith,” used by Alice in the text, is never abbreviated by an “in,” which is used elsewhere in the text. Therefore, the first part of choice “Alicia Smith” is wrong.<n><n>Now to choose between the first
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I am forgiving, what hidden force may be activated in my life? Choices:  A: nice feeling B: good karma C: respect D: new freedom E: good heart<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here the question tells us that the scientist aims to analyse data, whereas the last question of GMAT exam asks us to analyse reasoning. So here, we have to analyse the given sentences and we will get the answer. <n><n>Let's analyze the sentences of the Options:<n><n>(1)-A: nice feeling :Nice feeling does not fit the context, that is to analyse the force in my life. The force can happen in a nice feeling like forgiving, but does not have to be.<n><n>(2)-B: good karma:If we consider good karma, then this has no relation with what hidden force can be activated in my the hidden force in my life means forgiving. It is a fact that good karma activated by forgiveness is the forgiveness has to be there and not the good karma.<n><n>(3)-C: respect:- The forgiveness can be activated by doing respectful act. But forgiveness is not required nor does one have to have it in oneself.<n><n>(4)-D: new freedom: Forgiveness can bring new freedom to life.<n><n>(5)-E: good heart :- The forgiveness can be done by having a good heart.<n><n>So to find a good answer, the required thing has to be there. In option (4) or option (5), the required thing of a good heart for being capable of forgiveness is there. So option (4) or (5) would be correct answer.<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What should you do if your pens aren't work? Choices:  A: ink in B: caps C: ink cartridges D: take notes E: scribble<n>Output:		Reason:<n>We can eliminate all but the last option "take notes" from the list, because a pen just needs to work to work. <n><n>Since your pen should work, then caps (option B) and pen cartridges (option C), should not to be needed as options. <n><n>So finally we get "take notes" (E).<n><n>Input:What is the relationship between 0 and 1? Choices: 0 A: zero B: one C: one half D: non-integer E: both 0 and 1<n>Output: Reason::<n><n>As we all know, "0" means "zero" and "1" means "one," so the relationship between these numbers is simple. <n><n>The answer has to be "both 0 and 1" (E), because we can't have a relationship between non-integers such as 0.5 or 0.1 and whole numbers such as 0 or 1.<n><n>Input:What happens if you drop an ice cube? Choices:  freeze A: melt B: sublimate C: explode D: evaporate E: all of the above<n>Output: Reason:--<n><n>We can eliminate the options that "freeze" (A), "melt" (B), and "sublimate" (C) from the list, because an ice cube drops, and it melts. Also, an ice cube will not explode (D) nor will it explode (E).<n><n>So finally, we get the option "all of the above" (E).<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can you find a movie theater along with other stores in one placE? Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>First, it is necessary to determine the appropriate category in which to place each answer choice. All of the choices given are either locations or categories of locations.<n><n>When looking at option "urban area" (B), it is important to note that this is a type of location and not a specific one. As such, it needs to be categorized as a place which contains various types of stores, not as a distinct location.<n><n>When looking into option "new york city" (D), it is necessary to note that it is a distinct location where there is shopping. One cannot "find" a city, so it would not be eligible as a valid answer choice.<n><n>Finally look at option "downtown area" (A), it is a general location, which can contain a variety of stores and other businesses. As such, it does not give the specificity that some of the other answer choices seek. As such, it is not a valid  option.<n> <n>The final two options both include mentions of "military base", which is not required to include in the description of the location.<n><n>The remaining option is "shopping mall" (C). This provides both the word "mall" and the description "along" so that one can imagine the scenario described. As such, it would be the most accurate option to select.<n><n>Hence in all, the option C: shopping mall is the best choice.<n><n>Input: Which of these is not a word that begins with "W"? Choices:  A. win B. whirl C. whim D. wind E. whale<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>When analyzing options "whim" (C) and "wind" (E), it is necessary to understand their respective contexts. Option "whim" is an idea or notion with little or no basis due to it being based upon a person's sudden impulse, which is more abstract. Option "wind" refers to the actual movement of air, which is more concrete.<n><n>When looking over options "win" (A) and "whale" (E), it similarly is necessary to understand the contexts from which they derive. Option "win" is related to success, whereas option "whale" is the largest member of the order Cetacea (large ocean-dwelling mammals

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Why might someone want to be buying beer? Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n>Output:		reasoning:<n><n>A: Intoxication (D) is the most reasonable choice for this question because it indicates that the person wants to be drunk and inebriated. Option E, however, is ambiguous in that it mentions pleasures as a reason for drinking beer, while this isn't a necessary component of drunkenness. <n>Option C, "problems" (C) is an unexpected possibility because it's not logical to assume that beer can solve one's problems. It's also too broad in that one can apply it to any situation, regardless of the situation itself.<n>Option A, "getting arrested" (B) isn't likely to be the reason for one's beer purchase. While getting arrested and going to jail could result from drunk driving, it doesn't directly indicate that the person is intoxicated.<n><n>Option C, "SOBER" (C) is clearly the most erroneous possibility. While getting intoxicated is a natural outcome of drinking beer, it doesn't mean that you're getting intoxicated because you want to.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is: option D: Intoxication.<n><n>Input: What is the main similarity between the two words: warehouse and harbor. Choices:  A A. Shape B. Height C. Shape D. Height E. Shape<n>Output: reasoning: <n><n>There are a few options that might immediately strike the reader as correct: option A: similarity in "shape" (A), option B: similarity in "height" (B), and option E: similarity in "shape", but all of these are irrelevant. In terms of similarity in shape, options "A and B" are incorrect because they would be implying that warehouse and harbour have similar shapes.<n><n>Instead, the main similarity between warehouse and harbours is that they are both places where goods are stored. Therefore, the right answer is option "C": similarity of "place" (C).<n>So the final answer for this question = "C: similarity of place."

Choices:  A: satisfaction B: good feelings C: complications D: feel good about yourself E: stress<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:As a first step, we should look at the options with "helping people" (B) and eliminate them one by one. This leaves us with a choice of A, C, D, and E. Option B has already been eliminated, so the key thing to decide here is whether the other options include other actions that can also be interpreted as helping others.<n><n>If helping other people just meant to make them feel good, then all the other things would be out of scope. <n><n>But in reality, when we help, we are not always just concerned with making the other person feel good.<n><n>Option C is similar as it also mentions helping people, so this wouldn't always mean you're helping others.<n><n>In options A, D & E the helpers are doing something and in the help in option C is only doing one side and here it is 3 sides.<n><n>So the correct option is E: stress<n><n>Input:What are the disadvantages of being born?

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to understand what a human means as this question is asked in the singular form. A human can do a lot, with the choices being places of work, office, friend's place, workplace, etc. What is the common factor between places of work, office and friend's place? They are places to work. Where a human might go on some leisure time? Maybe on a vacation. The question is clearly asking about a place where one will likely relax and enjoy themselves. This leaves us with workplace and deep thoughts as the best logical options. Work would likely be a place where one might feel stressed or harassed or forced. And deep thought would be the very last place to go for some fun. So, the final answer should be E: deep thought<n>

Choices:  A: pretty flowers. B: hen house C: natural habitat D: storybook E: dense forest<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>We can eliminate choices B and C because they refer to the nature of the fox’s destination, implying that it is searching for something, not just roaming the forest aimlessly.<n><n>Choice A is also incorrect because it contradicts the narrative of the fox wandering further into the forest — surely flowers on the outskirts of the forest, rather than in the middle of the woods, would give the impression of wandering a little further but still closer to the exit. This rule can be used for all the multiple-choice questions.<n><n>Choice D is incorrect as it contradicts the fox’s entrance from the city into the woods — there aren’t any storybooks anywhere in this forest.<n><n>Choice E is correct as it is in line with the fox’s actions so far and it makes the most sense to conclude with it.<n><n>Input:What did the wolf do after receiving the news that the farmer would not provide food?

Secondly, think about context. <n><n>For example, with this question, the farmer has announced that he will not share his food. It stands to reason that the wolf will not be satisfied with this news, so options B and C cannot be the correct responses.<n><n>That leaves three options that do not have context, so let’s put them into context. The wolf is not satisfied, so why would the wolf go to the fox? The wolf could be starving, in which case the correct answer is C, but the narration indicates that the wolf is not starving.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do people use to absorb extra ink from a fountain pen? Choices:  A: shirt pocket B: calligrapher's hand C: inkwell D: desk drawer E: blotter<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The answer would be E: blotter.<n><n>A blotter is a piece of soft, smooth, absorbent material used to remove excess ink from the pen feed. This can help prevent stains on clothing and ensure cleaner writing.<n><n>The other options are not as likely to be used for this task and are more general in nature. Option A is the shirt pocket which is for storing items like change or keys, not ink.<n>Option B is the calligrapher'swriting hand, which is a specialized way of handwriting used by calligraphers themselves, not something someone else would use for fountain pen ink.<n><n>Option C is the inkwell which is a container for storing ink, rather than absorbing excess. Option D is the desk drawerwhich is neither an item to absorb excess ink nor to absorb ink from the pen, since it is a drawer to store items rather than absorb anything. <n><n>Option E: blotteris the only answer which is specifically used to absorb excess inkwritten by a fountain pen, making it the most likely answer. <n>So the answer would be E: BLOTTER  <n><n>Input: When the president is in London, he does not use his usual car and driver. Instead, he takes the London subway train from Parliament to Whitehall. What must he do in order to return to Buckingham Palace? Choices: <n>A: Go to Scotland by car B: Wait for the bus C: Walk back to Buckingham Place D: Switch trains<n>Output: The answer would be C: Walk back toBuckingham Place.<n><n>A president traveling in foreign lands should not simply walk around on foot. It is not safe. And walking back to Buckingham Palace is an inconvenience and inefficient.<n><n>The only two options that can cover all the requirements are Option C: Walk back to<n>Buckingham Place and Option D: Switch trains.<n>Option B: Wait for thebus is a common solution for many situations but in this scenario,the president can’t use it because the schedule for the bus is different.<n>Plus, it’s too expensive to travel by car and driver because the president is visiting London in the first place because the president doesn’t want a car in London and doesn’t want his driver with him

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What does playing soccer for a long time lead to? Choices:  A: excitement B: fatigue C: anger D: hurting E: getting tired<n>Output:		Reason:<n>So the first task is to define the parameters of the problem. In this scenario, playing soccer is a long term activity, lasting for an undefined amount of time in the future. The player is, therefore, most likely to suffer from fatigue (C). <n>The final answer is D: hurting<n>Input: What should you do first? Choices:  H: go home I: play games L: get ready N: talk with the person M: call the dentist P: call your wife Q: stay at work R: get married S: go to a class T: learn programming<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>So the first aspect to consider is the urgency of the situation. Given the time available, it's impractical to either do a dental check up or learn programming for one's career (M and T, respectively). Both of these options are thus ruled out.<n><n>The next aspect to consider is the person’s responsibilities. In this case, getting married is a monumental decision, and so this option is ruled out. Since the call to one's wife is probably a minor matter, and given the limited amount of time available, it is just as reasonable to assume that the player might not have a wife present. Therefore, this option is also ruled out.<n><n>Next, we consider how important the decision would be to the player. Getting married, as we mentioned above, is a major decision. Therefore, it is also unlikely to be a concern immediately before a game. So this option is also ruled.<n><n>Finally we consider the player’s obligations, and the fact that this decision needs to be made before entering a game. Given these factors, it would be the most reasonable option to call the dentist (P), as it is an immediate concern, and one’s overall health would obviously be a consideration before a game. Then, play games (L) would be the second choice, and given that it is plausible that one has already done this before the dentist call, one would just move on to the next task.<n>So the final sequence of actions would consist of the dentist call (P) followed by play a game (L), leaving the other options (H, I, M, N, Q, R, S, T) out.<n>

He constantly worried about what? Choices:  A: the reward money B: hurt feelings C: being found out D: problems E: trouble<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Sentence completion is another strategy for answering multiple-choice questions, which involves inferring a subject's intention from the context of the passage and correctly completing a sentence or phrase.<n><n>In this particular case, The key element of the sentence is what Sean is worried about. "He constantly worried about what" indicates that he is concerned about something specific.<n><n>However, just because the sentence contains a verb does not automatically make it an active predicate.<n><n>It is critical to consider the grammar of the sentence as a whole and its relationship to the preceding sentence.<n><n>Option "the reward money" (A) is an active predicate, which implies that Sean is concerned about the monetary reward for solving the case. This scenario does not seem to be consistent with the earlier indications that he was lying about the crime, however.<n><n>Another phrase that could be construed as an active predicate is "hurt feelings" (B), but this does not seem to be related to the context of Sean lying about the crime.<n><n>Option "being found out" (C) is an active construction that implies that Sean is worried that he will be discovered and arrested for lying about the case. This option is consistent with the context of Sean being found out and arrested for lying, which indicates that the active predicate is plausible.<n><n>Similarly, option "problems" (D) has been suggested as a potential active predicate, but the previous sentence implicated that Sean is lying about the crime, which does not seem to be a plausible scenario if he is facing problems.<n><n>The final option, "trouble" (E), is an active predicate that fits the context of Sean's actions.

Among them, the family of the victim did something to him. What was that? Choices:  A: knife wounds B: buy a gun C: bleeding D: jail time E: law suit<n>Output:		Reasonning: <n><n>The question asks about the family's reaction to Joe's crime. By reading the scenario again, a logical inference can be made that the family was seeking justice for their relative.<n><n>Option B (buying a gun) is not plausible because it doesn't fit the context.<n><n>Option D (jail time) would be possible, but it doesn't specifically state the family's reaction. We don't know if the family filed charges against Joe or not.<n><n>Further, options A and C are too vague. "knife wounds" (A) could refer to an injury, or it could refer to some physical damage to the family's house. Similarly, "bleeding" (C) could refer to blood pouring from a wound on the family member, or it could refer more generally to the family experiencing anguish over Joe's actions.<n><n>Finally we have option E, which is the only one that explicitly mentions a lawsuit. This provides the solidest indication that the family's reaction was a legal one, by filing a suit against Joe.<n><n>The final answer would be E: lawsuit.<n><n>Input:When she was asked for her date of birth by her friends,she replied that she was born on 15th Feb.,1947.When her father and mother were told about her birthday,they replied that it was on 15th of Feb  and a time gap of five years.Which month was her birthday? Choices: D: Feb 15 or Apr 15 B: March 15 or June 15 C: May 15,or Aug 15 E: Oct 15 or Dec15 Output: Reasoning: <n><n>The second element is determining the birthday. In the question, the answer choices suggest different years. It is likely that the mother and father of the girl in the story are old enough to have already had a first-hand experience of the 15th February in 1942. In this scenario, they would have been likely to remember the exact date.<n><n>Given our established information, the birthday would not have a five-year gap unless either of the two events had been misstated.

Choices:  A Mexico B Washington DC C New York D Ottawa E California<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The error in this sentence is missing a subject before the second verb, "can only be detected by a _____. That blank could be filled with a number of words, the most prominent being "nerd" or "people." While the latter is more plausible, the former best conveys the subjective nature of the sentence. A person who is a "nerd" also has to be subjective, so this is more grammatically correct. The error can only be fixed by replacing the subject "they" with "nerd" and moving "nerd" in front of the verb "can only be detected." <n>So, the final answer is A: Mexico.<n><n>[source](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-common-country-where-people-are-born/solution/country-of-birth/clue/find-the-last-part-of-the)

Choices:  A: in the basement B: west C: solar system D: beach E: beans<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n><n>Option "in the basement" (A) is the most out of the ordinary answer. A basement is usually a dark room with low (or no) windows, which would be unsuitable for sunbathing. Not to mention, it's unlikely that sunlight could even reach the basement. <n><n>Option "beaches" (D) doesn't seem to fit the scenario either.  A question about a beach wouldn't follow "Great place to lay in the SUN," and vice versa a question about a beach wouldn’t follow the word "beans." There must be a relation between the choices. <n><n>Therefore, the only two logical options remaining are in the solar system (B) and beans (E). The idea of sunbathing, or lying in the sunlight, immediately brings to mind the sun itself as the closest and best source of sunlight.<n><n>That being said, a solar system, which consists of the sun and its planets, could also meet the criteria of a great place to  lay down in the sun. The sun itself is a star with its own energy source, so why not the whole solar system? <n><n>Option "beans" (E) is the more practical answer. It's unlikely that any person would be lying on a diet of only beans, as it hasn't been found to be a great diet for most people. However, beans themselves are edible and would provide many nutrients to the body. So this option also fits the scenario.<n><n>The final answer is then beans (E), as the most logical conclusion. Henceforth, beans are the answer choice for this question.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below.

Choices:  A: near B: closeness C: here D: proximity E: this<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In the given example, the question requires us to determine the type of sensor being discussed in the example. There are multiple possibilities that could fit, so let's begin with the most obvious choice.<n>Option "near" (B) is the most likely answer to this question because it would seem sensible that the sensor would be located near the installation location.<n><n>The next two options - "closeness" (C) and "proximity" (D) - are less plausible choices. While those two terms are associated with locations, the placement or positioning of the sensor does not necessarily indicate how close it is in a spatial sense.<n><n>Option "this" (E), on the other hand, is the most unlikely response because "this" may not always describe the sensor. For example, if there is more than one sensor present, "this" could refer to any one of those sensors.<n><n>So option (B), "near," is the most likely answer and the final answer is option (B).

Option A is not the correct answer because "store" does not indicate where the student is expected and is also too general of a place to purchase items. Similarly, option B refers to the student's location, not that of the pencils. Similarly, option D is not the correct answer due to its vague mention of a "cabinet." So finally, it is most likely that the student is searching in the classroom to find a teacher, as this is the most specific location. <n><n>Option E is the only remaining candidate and is thus the only correct option. Reasoning:<n>Since the student needs to purchase pencils, it would make sense for him to acquire them in the classroom from his teacher.

Choices:  A: empathy B: anxiety C: knowlege D: falling down E: hear things<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n>As students, it is important to listen to the teacher to gain knowledge and understanding of the subject being taught. Listening can help students not only learn new concepts, but also understand them better and retain information more effectively. As such, it is one of the most effective ways for students to gain knowledge. <n><n>Input:Why not do both in my opinion, a good way to learn is to experiment by doing, and a good way to do is to try and learn too! Choices:  A:[B] C: D: E:<n>Output: Reasonnings:<n>Option "B": The correct answer is [B], which is a combination of doing and learning. While experimenting and learning are important skills on their own, they complement each other and can result in deeper understanding and improved retention of knowledge.<n><n>Doing and learning are two essential aspects of comprehension, and combining the two can have a profound effect on our understanding of the world. When we experiment, we gain hands-on experience of the material, while learning provides a deeper conceptual understanding.<n><n>As such, it is important to have a balance of experimenting and learning as it can help us develop a deeper understanding of concepts. By experimenting and learning together, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world and gain knowledge more fully.<n>That is why option [B], which is "Both in my opinion," is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: You're a good speaker of English but there are still some things you don't get right like using verbs of action in place of verbs of being, when you're saying "I am tired" you should say what you do, which is "I am walking"? Choices:  A B: C: D: E<n>Output: Reasonings:<n><n>Option “A”: The correct answer is [A] - “Yes, you should say what you are doing instead of what you are being.”<n><n>The reason why you should say what you're doing instead of what you're being is because saying what you're doing can be more accurate and specific. It can reveal more information about your state or feeling and it may express it better.<n><n>For example, if you say “I'm being tired” it may have a different meaning than if you say “I am tired of doing this,” as it may just be a feeling and you don

Choices:  A: desk drawer B: desktop C: office D: wristwatch E: city hall<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Based on the scenario provided, it is apparent that all options except E - "city hall" - are plausible options for where to store a calculator. <n><n>The accountant keeps one at home and another at the office, meaning he probably uses these devices regularly to perform work-related tasks (i.e. calculations for tax returns, balance sheets, etc.). It seems logical to find a calculator somewhere within the office space, as opposed to far away places like the wardrobe or desktop. The wardrobe (B) and desktop (C) are not very likely locations to store calculators, because it would be difficult and inconvenient to retrieve them.<n><n>An office, whether it's in the accountant's home, or workplace, would be the most logical place to store a calculator regularly used for business purposes, which is why this would be the correct answer.<n>Therefore, the final answer is D: office<n><n>Input: You might need to buy a suit in the coming week, although you may need it for a wedding. You have an old suit which you bought long ago. On a scale of 1 to 50, do you believe the suit’s grade of wear and tear is at least what grade? Choices: 1: 5 2: 25 3: 45 4: 62 5: 64<n>Output: Reason of Answer<n><n>Based on this scenario, we know that the suit is old enough to be worn on special occasions, such as a wedding. Looking at the options, the only one that describes a special occasion is option 2 (B), which indicates the suit's grade should be at least 25. <n><n>The suit in question would be quite old to be in the grade of 5 or higher. So, options 1 (A) and 4 (D) can be rejected.<n><n>The options available for grade do not directly correspond with wear and tear. Hence we cannot assume that 3 (C) would also be the correct answer. <n><n>Options 3 (C) and 4 (E) are also implausible since it will be difficult to find such ratings.<n><n>That leaves only option 2 (B) which would be the correct answer for this question. <n><n>Therefore the correct answer to

Choices:  A: being married B: sisters C: marriage D: two people E: lawyer<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "marriage"(B) is out of context as it doesn’t relate to the scenario. Option "divorce" (C) is closer to the theme. It would make sense for someone who is considering divorce to seek a divorce lawyer.<n><n>Option "divorce" still sounds a bit generic and vague. It would be difficult to tell what exactly someone wants to end if they are asking for a divorce. Option "to end" (E) is a bit out of the context but it makes up for it with the detail. It describes the exact relationship ended by the subject - a divorce.<n><n>From all the options, which one describes the most accurate action?

Option a is out of the context and doesn’t make sense. Option e is also out of context as there was no mention of a foreign country or anyone trying to sneak into the country. Option b is slightly more plausible - the man might try speaking in a foreign language to communicate his message. However, to a non-native speaker, his English might not be very good and he could appear to be an illegal immigration.<n><n>So the answer would be choice d: He was insist on speaking the same language.<n><n>Input:An employee is leaving the position.

Choices:  A: person B: species C: artichoke D: all mammals E: live animal<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To answer this question, we must determine which person among the respondents is more likely to have a caring heart. This can be done by looking at what the choices suggest about each person's personality. <n><n>From the choices, "person B" (B) is a species, which would imply that it is likely to do kind and caring acts. Meanwhile, for "species C" (C), we can make inferences that all the mammals within that species would possess caring hearts, not just some. Thus, this choice is not relevant to this question. <n><n>Therefore, we can eliminate "species C." <n><n>Finally, we now have two options - "all mammals" (D), which is a blanket statement that implies caring within the whole group, and "artichoke" (D), which does not make any specific claims.<n><n>Thus, the answer to this question is D: all mammal<n><n>Question 1 of 4:  A person with a heart of gold may have? Choices:  I: a heart of gold, a big bag of money and a tiny mustache. II: a great smile, a big heart and a tiny waist. III: a big heart of gold under a tiny waist. IV: no waist and a gigantic heart of gold. Output: Reason: Input: Choices:  One of the following statements made by a respondent has to reflect the personality of that person?<n><n>I. A person with a heart is like a person who's as sweet as sugar and gentle as a dove. II. You can't tell a person who's been born with a big heart at the end of the day. III. Some people have a heart that's too small and they might end up breaking it. IV. You should tell a person who has a heart of gold that they are the true gold of gold. Input: Reason:<n>From a purely literal standpoint, the choices given in Question-1 suggest a range of ideas about what a heart of gold might look like. If a person has a heart of gold, they might: i. Have a big smile and a tiny waist [I] ii. Have a massive heart that's made of gold [II] Alternatively, they might: iii. Have a large heart, but an average waist size [

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in solving this question is to understand the context and purpose of the action being performed. In this case, the lab technician is testing the effectiveness of a new skin cream by pinching a small spot of skin and applying the cream.<n><n>Next, consider the different sensations that may arise from what is described: a cream being applied to your skin, then being pinched and released by a lab technician.<n><n>When analyzing these options, it is important to consider the different sensations involved. Answer A, "it feels cold," doesn't work because the cream is being applied just before the pinching. So the skin would feel cold, not during the cream application.<n>Option B, "it feels pressure," is a bit of a stretch for this scenario. The resultant pressure is not likely to be enough to cause pain; instead, a mild pinching/releasing sensation would more likely occur.<n>Option C, "it feels bumpy," doesn't seem right either. A bumpy feeling would be more likely from an object being pressed into the skin, not a skin cream being applied.<n><n>Finally option D, "it itches," does capture the essence of the scenario. After the cream is applied, it is very likely that the skin will feel itchy. Hence this is the most plausible answer.<n><n>Input: In the case of all diseases are not contagious. Choices:  A. False B. True C. Distrust D. Incontestable E. Indeterminate<n>Output: Reason(s):<n><n>In this question, the key is to understand what is meant by "contagious". In most cases, contagious refers to the spread of disease from person to person through direct contact or through airborne or surface pathogens.<n>Many diseases require physical contact to be transmitted from person to person. Chicken pox is a classic example. Some diseases cause more serious symptoms if the virus spreads to a larger population. <n><n>In other cases, "contagious" can refer to the presence of bacteria or viruses found in the body, in the air, or on surfaces. A bacterial or viral infection means the "contagious" disease is present and spread from one person to another through

Choices:  C: The eyes are looking down.  B: No, the eyes are looking up.  A: No, the cucumber is cut in half.  D: No, the nose is pointing down. E: This answer is incorrect.<n>Output: Reasonable:<n><n>This question, like many multiple-choice tests, has two wrong answers, which are marked in the question as incorrect. This leaves two answers, which must be both true. <n><n>The first answer to this question is 'C', which asserts that the cucumber’s frown comes from the way the eyes are looking down. The problem with this answer, though, is that the cucumber doesn’t have any eyes. We’ve been given the question “Why does the cucumber feel like it’s frowned?”, so by definition, it must not have eyeballs or eyelids. The question doesn’t ask why the cucumber looks frowning; rather, the question is why the cucumber feels like it’s fussed.<n><n>Answer 'B', which says that the eyes aren’t looking up, also doesn’t hold up. Because there aren’t any eyes in the cucumber, it is also impossible for it to be looking up or down, because the cucumber doesn't have anything that can be up or down.<n><n>The answer is 'A', which says that it’s because the cucumber is half its normal length - specifically, because the cucumbers has been cut in half.<n><n>Input: What do you do when your head is stuck in a bucket of feathers?

Choices:  A: admiration B: applaud C: make reservations D: experience E: sleep<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The correct answer could use any synonym of "standing". "Experience" (E), although used in the question stem, is unnecessary, as the option gives no additional information beyond the verb "stand". <n><n>The option of "sleep" (E) is incorrect because it indicates the opposite of standing - sitting. The play can only cause the audience to stand, as opposed to sitting.<n><n>Similarly, the option of "make reservations" (C) is irrelevant and can be eliminated from consideration. This phrase may indicate that the audience would like to see the play in the future, but it does not relate to the current scenario of people standing during the play. <n><n>Only the remaining options have synonyms for "stand", thus narrowing the answer to "admiration" (A), "applaud" (B), and "standing" (C). "Admiration" (A) is less common than "applaud" or "standing", so that could be the reason for its repetition in the options.<n><n>Overall, option "standing" (C) should be chosen.<n><n>Input:The old man was walking and what?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a person who is well educated? Choices:  A: illiterate B: knowledgable C: own house D: have enough food E: meet expectations<n>Output:		Reason for answering:<n><n>For all the remaining answers under the first part of the question, there are no relevant context (e.g. no person who is well educated is also an illiterate, because "well educated" implies the person must know how to read and write) or sufficient explanation (e.g. "own house" or "have enough food" may be sufficient for a well-educated person's needs).<n><n>Under the second part of the question, the options are less clear, however. "Meet expectations" (E), implies that the person must meet the expectations set by others, and there's no reason to believe that being well educated would result in meeting the expectations of others.<n><n>"Have enough food" (D), meanwhile, is plausible because being well-educated may give you access to food or provide opportunities to learn how to grow food, but it's not the end goal of being "well-educated.<n><n>"Being knowledgable" (C) would seem to imply that knowledge is somehow superior to food or shelter, which is not necessarily accurate.<n><n>Finally under the context, "knowledgable" (C), may be something which a person may have that makes him/her well educated for some people, but may not be something a well-education person should have - it depends on who you ask.<n><n>Finally the most accurate answer is "Being knowledgable",because that is what is expected of a well-educate person by majority of the population.<n><n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.<n>Input: What is a word used to describe a person who is not well educated? Choices;  A: literate B: uneducated C: ignorant D: well-educated E: fool<n>Output:Reason for answer:<n><n>All the remaining questions fail to be considered well-educated. Answer A) describes a person who can read and write, which is what most people mean when they say someone else is well-educated - if you can't read and write, you are probably not regarded as "well-education".<n><n>As for the second part of the multiple choice question, answers C), D) and E) all fail to fulfil the intended meaning of the term "well-educ

Choices:  A: mail box B: suitcase C: front door D: bowl E: post office<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The word "front door" is not a valid choice because this term doesn't explicitly mention the delivery of a letter. Also, the term "bowl" excludes the possibility of hand-delivery as well.<n>This leaves us with the choices "mailbox", "suitcase", or "post office".<n>The only one that could feasibly be a front door is "suitcase". People commonly use suitcases to transport mail, such as when mailing parcels from abroad.<n>Hence, this would be the correct answer.<n>So the final option is D: suitcase<n><n>Input: A scientist may be performing an experiment which includes what?  Choices:  A : observing B : learning C : teaching D : tapping E : writing<n>Output: Reason for final answer:<n><n>"Writing" (E) is an acceptable option as a result of an experiment, but not immediately apparent what the scientist is writing about. This makes this choice out of scope in terms of this question.<n>Option "observe" (A) requires the scientist to be present during the experiment and the data cannot be collected, hence the answer must be ruled out.<n><n>Next, we have "teaching" (D), which is also a valid result of an experiment. As with writing, not everything is known of this process and so cannot be the answer.<n>On the other hand, option "learning" (C) is indeed a possibility in the experiment. Thus, this would be most logical answer to the question.

Choices:  A: wage war B: fight enemy C: kill D: destroy enemy E: attacked his country<n>Output:		Reason: The president needed to come to a conclusion about how to respond to the hate attack on his nation. So the only correct option that makes sense would be "to attack his country"(E), because the attack was done on his country and the president needs to come to an end to the attacks.<n><n>Input:The prince was born to the king, therefore he was a... Choices A: a kingB: kingC: princeE: peasantD: prince<n>Output: Reason for correct answer: Being born to a king makes one a prince.

So Option A: is performing well (A) is correct. <n><n>Input:John is a young boy and has had a good day, what would be the best sentence to describe his expression? Choices: A. has been happyB. not disappointedC. happyE. contentD. not content <n>Output: The reason for the correct answer being content (D) is because John has enjoyed the day and thus is content (D). The other options are not necessarily incorrect, and are all used commonly.<n><n>input:A company has opened a new factory in Japan, what should be the company's slogan? Choices: A) qualityB) priceC) performanceD) bestsellerE) fastF) speed<n>Output: The reason A,B,D,E are incorrect; The company is not Japanese so this does not make sense as a slogan (A,B,D,F)  The company wants people to buy based on the product's performance (C) therefore the correct answer should be based on performance, not cost so B is incorrect.<n><n>input:The boy was good and kind to others, but he did not have time to do his homework.

Choices:  A: dream B: fiddle C: watch film D: see new E: work<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Once again, there are a plethora of possible answers to choose from for the scenario of boredom in the office. But the question in this context does not seek to understand how to alleviate boredom, but rather how to deal with it.<n><n>A, "fiddle" (B), suggests distraction, so long as it doesn't result in "boredom," which is the answer to the question "how to tell if you're bored." But that's not the answer.<n>Options "try something new" (E) and "do maths problem" (D) seem to encourage breaking the monotony of an office job, so they are also ruled out.<n>Options "work" (A-B) and "dream" (C) both imply the opposite of boredom - excitement or engagement. None of these describe an answer to "how to tell if bored." <n><n>Meanwhile, option "watch a movie" (D) connotes a break from one activity, such as work, to another, such as entertainment. While there may be a brief relief from boredom, that relief may actually prolong the feeling of boredom.<n>The answer is therefore: E: work<n><n>Input: What's more valuable money or time? Choices:  Time (A) Money (B)<n>Output: Reasoninng:<n><n>Money and time are two fundamental resources with various uses. Money is a medium of exchange and can be exchanged for goods and services. Time is a finite resource that is valuable in and of itself and can be used for leisure and to complete various tasks.<n><n>Answer:<n>(A) Time (B) Money<n><n>Input: What can you use Money in the kitchen. Choices:  K: Cook food B: Buy food C: Wash dishes D: Buy foodstuffs E: buy foods<n>Output: Reasonining:<n><n>The question invokes the image of cooking with money in the kitchen. One could use money to cook a meal, but that is not a common or logical usage of money. Rather, money in the kitchen conjures up an image of pouring coins down a pay phone or in a jukebox, among other non-cooking activities. It is likely that none of these actions would be

Choices:  A: cafeteria B: arranging papers C: in the park D: formal dining room E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing we observe is that, from the context, we know that the "dining table," referred to in the question, isn't the answer to a different question about where to buy some furniture. The only relevant question relates back to where a "dining table" can be placed within a certain location. The options given are a few different options, so the first step is to eliminate any options that are inappropriate:<n><n>* "arranging papers" (C): This doesn't really seem to fit the description of putting a table somewhere.<n>* "formal dining room" (D): The term "dining room" implies that a formal setting would be appropriate. The question doesn't ask about how to have a formal meal at that table; so the formal dining room option is eliminated.<n><n>Let's analyze each option in further detail:<n><n>* "cafeteria" (A): This is a possible option, but it doesn't seem to completely fit in with the other options given. In the "office" sense, the cafeteria would be the same as the "arranging papers" choice (i.e., it would be the place to work and not to eat), but this doesn't mesh with the question about where to place a table. It would be possible to place a table in a cafeteria, but it would be used for consumption rather than placing objects down. Therefore, this particular option is eliminated as well.  <n><n>* "in the park" (B): This choice is eliminated because the question already includes a place that would be very similar to the park (it's a place to eat and sit down rather than the place to consume objects).<n><n>After we've completed this process, we can determine that there are only two options left: the formal dining area (D) and the cafeteria (A). But the option of making it the formal dining area would be redundant with another choice given in the question. The cafeteria, meanwhile, has a significant distinction from the other three: it implies the possibility of an entire meal, including eating. The meal is not implied for the formal eating choice (B) - a meal is simply a part of the dining process. Therefore, this would explain why we were supposed to put a new table in the

Choices:  A: stress B: food C: that you D: spending money E: walking<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A is probably the most obvious candidate. People may go to markets to buy different kinds of food, but these foods aren't bought on a whim. Instead, they are a means for people to cope with stress, usually caused by busy work schedules.<n><n>Option B is another potential answer, in that some people go to markets to have a break from their regular lives by engaging in a hobby such as baking or gardening.<n>However, both options A and B have weak points. Both options involve the word "that," suggesting that people go to markets because they want that (the food or hobby). In this sentence structure, the word "that" is actually more likely to be used for an external goal rather than internal emotions.<n><n>Options C and D are essentially different versions of the same answer - people spend money to buy food, which alleviates stress caused by long jobs and busy schedules. This answer is also vague and can be inferred from the question without the need for any prior knowledge (like the hobby example from option B, and the answer can be interpreted in more than one way. One person could be going to the market to buy groceries while another person could be going to buy a meal outside. The latter could also be considered a form of leisure.<n><n>Therefore, the most suitable answer would be B: food, since it's the least specific version.<n>So the the final answer is B: food

Choices:  A: orchestra B: baritone woodwind sound C: symphony D: play music E: high school band<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In the given sentence the word "played" can either refer to the noun "the bassoon" or the verb "to play". Therefore, the first thing to do is differentiate between them. If the noun is being used, the context will be: what kind of environment does a bassoon sounds well (played) in. On the other hand, if the verb is being used, the question will be about which environment does one hear "THE bassoon played in an UNpleasing fashion". Now you can cross-out "orchestra" (which would be the usual way a bassoon sounds) and "symphony" (as you can't listen to individual instruments in it) which leaves us with "high school band" (since it sounds bad in every other context except a high school band).<n><n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>This type of question can often trip you up. The clue is to look out for subtle differences in the sentence. In this question, the answer can be found by analysing the word "unpleasing" - does it mean "disagreeable to the ear" or does it mean "not pleasant" or other synonyms. If the answer is the first, the question would suggest somewhere that the music is played in, not the musician herself. On the other hand if it should be "not pleasant", you have to look out for the words "music sounds". That's an indication that the question is about the music being played, and not the musician. This leads us to two conclusions, either "baritone woodwind sound" or "play music".<n><n>Since the woodwind instrument cannot be played by one person, and "play music" does not help us discern between playing the musical instrument and playing the music, the answer is "baritone woodwinds".<n><n>## # Input:You can hear an orchestra in the distance and wonder if you can go for a walk and get there in time for it to start playing. Do you think a train leaving the station at exactly 7:57:02 am is going to leave exactly at this time?

Choices:  A: school B: home office C: people store D: print shop E: newspaper office<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key to answering this question is understanding the definition of the word "printer" in the context of this question. A printer is a physical device that produces copies of documents or images. This means that printers are not typically used in places where individuals work, such as a "home office" (B) or a "school" (A).<n><n>A printer cannot be used by thousands of individuals at a time. However, a printing press can be used in a "newspaper office" (E), where large numbers of articles and news stories are produced daily.

Choices:  A: bus stop B: graph C: post office D: grass E: play<n>Output:		Reason: The context of the question does not provide sufficient information to disregard any available options. <n><n>To answer the question, we must first determine what the subject at hand may require additional details or additions to their information.<n><n>Option "bus stop" sounds reasonable - the question says "add" something. Thus option A can be ruled out.<n><n>It also doesn't make sense that they would add grass. The line of the paragraph doesn't mention anything about grass, nor does it speak of adding anything to the post office or play. The only line that hints at adding something is the bus stop, making option B the more sensible choice.<n><n>Finally option E "play", is just not suitable for the situation mentioned in the prompt. Play is not a line, addition or addition material, therefore E must be disregarded.<n><n>Options A and B seem to be viable candidates for the correct answer. However, by evaluating the context and the information given in the prompt, it can be concluded that B is the correct answer.<n><n>The given information tells us that someone would like to add a line to a bus stop, so option B is the more appropriate choice because the answer mentions a bus stop. As such, the correct answer to this question is option B:  bus stop<n><n>Input:What is an adjective for what they did to the tree?

In the question, it is asked to pick an adjective that would describe what they did to the grass.<n><n>Options 1 and 2 are both nouns - "cute" is an example of a noun.<n><n>Options 3 and 4 are both verbs - "nice" is an example of verbs.<n><n>To determine the correct answer, it is necessary to look at the question and pick any answer that would describe what they have done to the grass.<n>So the adjective is "cut", with a connotation of being done/ made clean, meaning that it is acceptable for the question at hand.<n>And finally option 5, 'nice', is not acceptable because it is not an adjective and is not relevant. Therefore, the right answer is 'Cut', with the corresponding
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:How can one's views change after learning about science? Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>It is reasonable to assume that a change in the way we view things can be attributed to learning about them. Therefore, the option, "see things differently" (E) would make logical sense as the correct answer.<n><n>Options (B) and (C) are incorrect, as they do not refer to a specific type of learning.<n><n>Option (D) is inaccurate because it implies a broader spectrum of new knowledge, rather than a transformation in the way we view the world.<n><n>Option (A) suggests that learning about science will lead to a greater appreciation of nature, however it is unlikely that one's appreciation for nature would substantially change with a single piece of scientific knowledge. There are also other ways to appreciate nature aside from learning about science, such as through travel or art, and so this option is wrong.<n><n>Input:The first thing a nurse should do when providing care is to respect the patient's Choices:  A:"I can do this, I'm a nurse!" B: "It must be nice to have your own room!" C: "Didn’t you used to be a patient here?" D: "I got you." E: "Welcome to x hospital"<n>Output<n>Reasoning:<n>The option "didn't you used to be here"? (E) could be interpreted as a way of welcoming a patient into the hospital and showing that they are surrounded by people who care about them. <n>The option "I got you"(d) could be seen as an expression of support and reassurance, which are essential components of providing care.<n>Nurses are expected to maintain professionalism and compassion while providing care. The other answers could be construed as not being respectful to the patient, as they are either showing lack of respect for the patient (B) or making unrelated comments that are insensitive to the patient's situation (C). The fourth option (D), which is simply stating the phrase "I got you" is a phrase commonly used in US English, which makes it more likely that a US English speaker would find it acceptable.<n><n>The correct answer is D: "I got"<n><n>Input:The "good" person may sacrifice their own life Choices:  A:`sacrifice their own happiness or security B: to "do what is right" C: even when it
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:An expressway can suffer from traffic, this traffic gets worse the closer you get to any what? Choices:  A: michigan B: map C: american city D: rest stops E: country<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The purpose of asking this question is to identify the intended geographical destination of the expressway. When looking at the alternatives, the first consideration is to discard those that do not seem to apply to the scenario, such as "map" (B). We know the expressway does not exist on a map so it should be eliminated.<n>Next, we should think about what the answer might not be, which often gives us a hint as to what it might be. For example, "not map" (C) suggests an alternative. The answer choice "country" (E), therefore, eliminates "map" (B) and suggests "not map" (D) which can lead us to the correct answer, "country" (D), by process of elimination.<n>As another example, if you think about what the answer cannot be, the answer choice "map" (B), it also eliminates "not map" (E) because that cannot be the case. Then, "not rest stops" (D) is the remaining choice. This eliminates "map" and "rest stops" (D)(F) as well as "American city" (F) and leaves us with the correct answer, "not rest stops."<n>So the final answer here is C: not country<n><n>Input:In a movie, there are actors and actresses, the actors are what? Choices: A: guys. No. B: ladies. Yeah! C: both and neither D: male actors. E: female actors. Not too shabby.<n>Output: Explanation:<n><n>The first thing to note is that the options themselves do not contain enough information to find the correct answer. We first start by getting rid of the "no"s because they do not have correct answers. After eliminating "no"s (A), we can get rid of all "yay"s (B) since there's not a yes answer for a "yay." There are two "yes"s (D) and two "naw"s (E). However, "yeah" (C) is an incorrect answer because there are only four answers, whereas there should be five. Therefore, the answer is C: male actors.<n><n>Input: A "Hunger Games" franchise, many people enjoy this franchise. This franchise involves what? Choices: F: People. A: games. E: a

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What can someone feeling happiness fall into? Choices:  A: lead to laughter B: love C: laughter D: smiles E: tears<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>We first have to identify the options that are irrelevant to the context of the statement.<n><n>Option "laughter" (B) is out since happiness isn't limited to laughter. There are many forms of expressions in which one can express happiness.<n><n>Option "tears " (E) is out as well since it isn't a form of expression for happiness. Option (D) is possible, but the most relevant answer would be "smiles", as smiling is universally recognised as an expression of happiness.<n><n>Since only two options remain, it is possible to eliminate "love" (C) since smiling and laughing are forms of happiness which we use at times with ourselves too. Therefore, we would be left with only "happiness" (D).<n><n>Input: What is a way you can increase your awareness to problems in the world? Choices:  I: Read the news about problems in the world. II: Be happy. III: Write to congress about the problems in the world. IV: Talk to people about the problems in the<n>world<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The first step is to analyse each option. The first two options, "Read the news about problems in  the world" (I) and "Talk to people about the world" (IV), are very easy to eliminate since they are not relevant to the context of increasing your awareness. If you're reading to get news, you're not increasing your awareness of problems.<n><n>The second set of options "Write to congress about problems in the world" (III) and "Be happy" (II), are very generic, and we are better left without any useful information from these two, since happy people don't always know the problems of the world.<n><n>However, the single remaining option, which is "do not care, you should be happy not aware" (II) is actually correct. Being happy about problems will not make you aware of whatever problems there are.<n><n>Input: What does everyone in the lab do every day? Choices: A: Write some lab codes. B: Innovating.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The people in class were instructed to brainstorm ideas, how would they use their minds for this? Choices:  A: shake hands B: control events C: talk to each other D: think creatively E: dress themselves<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To identify the correct answer, the first task is to understand what the people are instructed to do.<n>The word "instructed" implies that a specific action is being requested, in this case, the brainstorming of ideas.<n><n>Then, the next task is to pinpoint the specific purpose behind the brainstorming activity in question.<n>Option "control events" (C) does not fit the context of the situation, as controlling events is not the purpose of brainstorming ideas. It's also unclear what "events" the speaker is referring to.<n><n>Similarly, option "dress themselves" (D) does not fit the requested action of brainstorming. And it may be grammatically incorrect to say "dress themselves" in this context, as the reference to "themselves" might be ambiguous.<n><n>Only the option "think creatively" (E) fits the request to brainstorm ideas. Therefore, it would be the correct answer choice.<n>So the final answers are E: think creatively<n><n>Input: The people in class have a lot of potential, according to the teacher, what did he think the individuals could accomplish in the future? Choices:<n><n>A, B, C, and D are all logical and grammatically correct alternatives that can be accepted.<n><n>(A)"Become better at thinking creatively" provides a general definition of thinking creatively.<n><n>(B)"Become a better friend" provides a specific definition of friendship.<n><n>(C)"Become a better writer" provides a specific definition about writing.<n><n>(D)"Become a better musician" provides a specific definition for music.<n><n>Although each of choice A, B, C, D has its own pros and cons, "D" is the most suitable to answer to the question. The word "become" emphasizes the process and the act of becoming something, meaning that in order for the individuals to do what the teacher thought "they could accomplish".<n><n>Hence, the answer for "What did he think the individuals in the class could accomplish in the future?" is D - "Become a better music."<n><n>Input:The students are very quiet in science class, not like in other subjects. The teacher said she would make them practice speaking so they could be more confident about giving presentations.<n><n><n>The

Choices:  A: fishing camp B: hardware store C: engine D: your spine E: sporting goods store<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The first task is parsing apart the question and locating the entities that are described. In this case, the "rod" in the question would refer to a specific rod or fishing rod. This would eliminate options like "fish camp" (B) and the "hardware store" (C), neither of which refer to a specific rod.<n><n>The next task involves deciding which definition fits best for the entity of "hardware store", and then moving on to determine what entity corresponds to "rod".<n><n>The only thing that really fits in "hardware store" is "threw a rod", which is not really what is meant by a hardware store. A hardware store is a place where you would buy tools. So while "hardware store" could be taken to represent a store that sells rods, it's probably more helpful to decide what the entity referred to is using a different metaphor. This is the same reason why "fish camp" (option/B) was already disqualified. You don't go to a fish camp and throw rods, you go to a fish camp with rods and use them.<n>Therefore, the metaphor that fits best with the entity "rod" is the one that mentions a "spine", which would be option "D: your spine". So the final answer is "D: your spinal column".<n><n>Input: Which of the following is a true about the US's education system when compared to the education system in many South American countries? Choices: <n>A: More universities exist in the US.<n><n>B: More 4 year colleges exist.<n>C: More people in the US work in higher education.<n>D: The average education year in the US consists of more than 12 years.<n>E: The US has a much higher rate of higher education students studying in a foreign country.

Choices:  A: boat B: ocean C: pond D: end of line E: ocean<n>Output:		The only possible answer here is "pond" (C), as the other options cannot apply to the given scenario. That answer is almost intuitively obvious because it makes the most sense - the fact that "pond" is the right answer isn't exactly a surprise.<n><n>Comment: Why was this not accepted and upvoted?<n><n>Answer: The answer is \strong{Better understanding} The given options do not make much sense for the statement.<n><n>Answer: The choice is (of course) \strong{Better Understanding}. The question states that the scientist is analyzing the lab results. \em{Analyzing}, to my understanding, means interpreting data. This would result in a "better understanding", not the other options.

Choices:  A: communicating with others B: hurt feelings C: dry mouth D: intimacy E: changing behavior<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>For all of the options, we must ask if speaking with other people can be classified into some of those categories.<n>A is clearly out, because communicating with others does not involve hurting other people's feelings.<n>C is also out, for very similar reasons to A - communicating with other people does involve dry mouth, but it doesn't necessarily involve "dry mouth" in the sense of actually having a dry mouth.<n><n>This leaves us with four options that are related to either personal intimacy or changing behavior.<n>Of the remaining four options, we can rule out "intimacy" (E), which doesn't typically apply to conversation. We can also rule out "changing behavior" (D), which also does not apply.<n><n>Then, we are left with two categories: "communicating with others", and "hurting someone's feelings". Communicating with someone else certainly does not involve hurting somebody else's feelings, therefore that reduces that category to "changing behavior". Therefore, C is the answer: C: changing behavior<n><n>Input:What do you do when someone asks you how you’re feeling while in the midst of a panic attack? Choices: <n><n>A: Shrug <n>B:  Feel better<n>C: Tell them<n>D: Laugh<n>E: Cry<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The first step should be to understand the situation – in this case, the person is having a panic attack when someone asks them how they feel.<n><n>Next, we should consider what we want to accomplish. In this case, we want to address the emotions that we are feeling and communicate our emotions to those around us. This is achieved by telling the inquirer of our emotions using one of the possible options, which are listed below.<n>When it came to the choice to shrug, this seemed to us like the most likely answer.<n><n>However, a closer reading of the scenario is necessary: “feel better” (B) is certainly a possibility, since we can achieve that by telling someone of our current emotional state.<n><n>Telling someone (C) works well to communicate what we are currently feeling, and is a great form of communication to be adopted with regards to our overall quality of life.<n><n>While the concept of “making an ass” of ourselves during a panic attack is amusing

Choices C and D both are correct answers because they are action verbs: you’re typing words and you’re falling asleep. That rules out C and D.<n><n>Your watching television and accomplish nothing suggests that you’re spending your time on something that doesn’t count for anything. Since it’s a TV show, a better phrase might be “nothing that counts.” D and E are incorrect.

Choices:  A: desk drawer B: cup C: pencil case D: shelf E: office depot<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The first task of this choice is clarifying the context. We know that John has run out of pencils, which means that he was once in possession of some. The choice "desk drawer" (A) is likely to hold a box of pencils. So this is a plausible option.<n><n>BUT, we can also infer that he must have lost the pencils, meaning that he's not re-sharpening one that is running out of lead, but rather retrieving a whole new pencil.<n><n>As for "cup" (B), this only provides a very vague solution, since it doesn't specify where the pencil is kept. It could be in a desk drawer, it could be the cup at his desk, or it could be the cup that he drinks from.<n><n>The choice "pencil case" (C), while a reasonable assumption to make, actually lacks the context that "desk drawer, " has. The context points to desk accessories. This is important, because John ran out of pencil, so we can infer with greater confidence that he was in possession of a pencil case.<n><n>"Shelf" (D) is also plausible, since a box of pencil could be stored on his desk shelf as well.<n><n>The final option of the answer is "Office Depot" (E). John knows that he has run out of pence so he must go to the store that he procures his supplies from. This eliminates "shelf" (D) and other viable options such as "cup" (B).<n>So, the answer that best fits the scenario is C: pencilcase

Choices:  A: sitting down B: refusing C: saving money D: sit down E: go outdoors<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Notice that the first choice "sitting down" (A) is the one that involves action on the part of the passenger: the passenger is the one sitting down, not the bus.  This would be one of the only times that an answer choice involves action.<n>Option B is the most viable choice: when a char is full of people, they are refusing to leave. The char is also full because it is also occupied by people - that is, the char is full of people doing what the passengers are doing (which is either refusing to leave the char or sitting down). <n><n>Choice C would also be correct if a person were physically saving money (as the money has intrinsic value, unlike money on a bank). However, the money being saved implies the person has a char to sit in. So this choice, while accurate, would involve an additional action. <n><n>Choice "sit down" (D) is incorrect here: there is no choice, because all the seats are taken. The passenger thus cannot and is not expected to sit down. <n><n>Choice E is likewise incorrect, because the passenger is not going outdoors but trying to take a seat on the bus.<n><n>So the answer is B: refusing<n><n>Input:The scientists needed to know: what is the most abundant mineral in the human body?

Choices:  A: ohio B: washington state C: alaska D: canada E: flowers<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>There are a couple of key points to note here.<n>1. When an item you have purchased at a shop is "imported", it means that it was not grown/manufactured/sold in your nation. <n>2. While "Ohio" (A), "Washington State" (B), "Alaska" (C), and "Canada" (D) are distinct regions in the USA, they are still a part of the United States. They are therefore non-imported goods.<n>3. If the item was manufactured or grown in "Canada" (refer point 2), it would indeed be an imported commodity.<n>4. While Canada might seem like an "imported good", it is not because the USA doesn't pay duty on goods from other states in the USA.<n>Now that the context is straight, we can focus on the specific purpose behind our question, which is: what makes an item an imported good. By eliminating "Ohio", "Washington State", "Alaska", and "Canada" as they do NOT make something an imported good, that leaves option E, where an item is an imported good when it originates elsewhere than the US.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.<n>Input:The scientist asked his assistant to put their results into a chart to represent them all.

Choices:  A: training B: satisfaction C: injury D: beauty E: late<n>Output:		The correct answer to this multiple choice question is "training".<n><n>Explanation: Option "training" was the correct answer to the question. The phrase "does not cause" suggests that it is always important to groom a pet's nails correctly. Grooming is a procedure that involves training a pet, and therefore, it cannot cause injury.<n><n>Option "injury" does not fit the intended meaning of the sentence. An injury, by definition, is caused by an intervention or an event causing damage to tissue. Thus, it would be unusual or incorrect to use the term "injury" to describe the potential outcome of grooming a pet's nail.<n><n>Option "satisfaction" is also not correct. This option suggests that grooming is an act to make the pet satisfied with the procedure. As previously mentioned, grooming requires training the pet, which would result in the owner gaining a certain degree of satisfaction, but not the pet itself.<n><n>Option "beauty" does not make sense in this context. Grooming a pet's toes would help the owner gain satisfaction and beauty. But it would not have any effect on making the pet more attractive to the owner.<n><n>Finally "late" is an incorrect answer to the question. Late is not always necessary for grooming a dog's nails. It could be done on a random basis, just like a health checkup for a pet, and would not take up the owner's time late.<n><n>So, as a whole the answer is "training".<n># input: The man was very depressed and wanted to hurt what: Choices:  A. Someone's face. B. His own face.<n><n>Output: A. The correct answer to the multiple choice question was "someone's face".<n><n>Explanatio: The answer was already indicated by the question's structure and context.<n><n>The question is in the passive voice, and it does not mention the identity of the subject, indicating that it wants to use the active voice of "hurt someone's face". The question also suggests that the man was very depressed. Such psychological condition is unrelated to "hurt my face".<n><n>Option "his own face" is the most common option among the four choices. But this option would not fit the intended meaning. By using this phrase to phrase the question, it would

Choices:  A: vomiting B: pleasure C: happiness D: contentment E: mess<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>The first step is to determine what purpose breakfast in bed might serve. <n><n>The only obvious reason is as a sort of pampering or luxurious practice. Therefore, the options which focus on gaining pleasure (B) and content (D) should be immediately excluded. <n><n>But we can't discount the possibility that someone might spill something if eating in bed. For that to be ruled out, we'd have to assume that the scientist is "superhuman" with perfectly steadfast hands. It's highly unlikely that such a perfect scientist would be described in a logic puzzle, which means that the chance of anything being spilled is almost certain. <n><n>Therefore, the only other viable answer would be "happiness" (C). There are no known negative consequences to having breakfast in bed, and eating happily is a common activity which could come with the meal.<n><n>### Link:<n>https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcode-lc-interview-questions/10/

Choices:  A: go to jail B: incarceration C: intercourse D: death E: judgement<n>Output:		Reason: The judge's actions in this scenario lead to what? "To condemn" (D) is a suitable answer.<n><n>The judge's actions involve deciding what punishment to give the man at his trial. That would obviously be a decision of his own volition, which means the man is condemned to the jail by the judge's decision. This is why "death" (E) is incorrect. While that was indeed the sentence, what really condemned the man to jail was the judge's decision to pass sentence. Therefore, it was the judge who "condemned" him, which led to his jail sentence.<n><n>Next, "judgement" (B) does not mean condemnation. A judgement is merely a decision or opinion, and could mean the opposite of condemnation. Likewise, "go to jail" (A) doesn't fit because the judge's passing sentence ultimately decided the outcome. "Incarceration" (C) is also incorrect because it does not directly fit either of the previous definitions of "condemn", nor does it mean condemnation.<n><n>Finally there is "passing sentence" (F). However, a passing sentence was not the outcome of the man's trial but the sentence itself. Also, "passing sentence" does not necessarily equal "judgement".<n><n>Since none of these options are correct, the correct answer is "death".<n>

How should the scientist summarize the results? Choices:  "There were bacteria." "All the bacteria were true bacteria." "Everything is bacteria." "Some bacteria are other kinds of bacteria." <n>Output: Reasonlogy:<n><n>1. "There were bacterio" is not a suitable response, because it doesn't describe the experiment's results in general. It is also not an exact answer to the original question, which was "How should the scientist summari the results?"<n>2. "All the bacterio" (D) would not be the best summary, as this would imply that all of the bones were part of the bacteria (or bacterio) sample.<n>3. "Everything is bacoeria" would be an incorrect answer, as the response doesn't accurately summarize the results. It is also possible to have non-bacterial bones, so "everything" would be too broad and general.<n>4. "Some bactoria are other kinds of" would be incorrect because the "are" indicates that something is related to bacteria. However, no such conclusion can be drawn from the results of the experiment.<n>5. So the only correct response that answers the original question perfectly is "Some bacteria is other kinds of bacterium." Reasoning:<n>6. The first step is to identify the main purpose of the summary. Specifically, it should outline the general conclusion from the experiment.<n>7. The next task is to identify the main points of the results. In this case, the results should indicate that all of the bone samples were bacterial in nature. Thus, the correct summary should reflect these primary insights.<n>8. The final step is to combine these two pieces of information to generate an accurate summary. This could look something like "Some bacteria was other kinds of bacterial

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Blood isn't usually spilled during what sport that doesn't allow the use of hands? Choices:  A: soccer game B: capillaries C: ball D: animals E: person<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "blood isn't usually  spilled in a soccer game" (A) is partially correct: blood can be spilled in a soda game, but not during the actual soccer play. If you've ever seen a soccer player roll on the ground (because they got an accidental elbow or foot to the face), they're "spilling their blood" - but it's not part of the sport itself.<n><n>Option "bloody sport that doesn't not allow the use of hands" (B) is technically grammatically correct, but the spelling is incorrect and the order of the words is incorrect. We would say that a bloody "sport is", not that bloody "sports" allow for the use of hands. Moreover, a sport doesn't allow anything - humans are allowed to play certain sports, but not a sport itself.<n><n>Options "animals" (B) and "'sport that doesn't allow hands'" (E) are also both wrong. If a sport did involve the use of arms and hands, the animal would probably have to have arms and hands to play said sport. Likewise, if humans were to develop extra arms and hands specifically for playing that sport, we likely wouldn't still call it "an animals sport", but rather still a human competition.<n><n>Option "ball" (D) is a plausible response, but it would depend on the specific sport. In basketball and cricket, for example, it's the ball that the participants use, but it's still played by humans and we would call it a sport that humans play, not a sport with blood.<n><n>Finally option "game" (C) is the most appropriate choice. A game can be categorized as a sport. If you were asked whether a person plays an animals sport, you would probably respond "yes", or at least "the person plays the sports with the animals". But if you're asked to categorize the sport as a whole, the sport is no longer related to a person. If you were to categorize the sport with a animal, you would probably call it a sport, instead.<n><n>In addition to the spelling error, option "Blood isn'tn't usually spilled in a person game" (C) also doesn't describe the kind of blood spillage described in the question.

In this question,'made first violin' essentially means'makes first violin', which suggests the person is a musician. <n>But there's the catch - a person cannot play the violin if they're at the position of a'symphony orchestra' (C).<n><n>Thus, the answer would be 'learning to play the violin' (D).<n>The only relevant option left is 'learning to play the guitar' (C), which falls short when the person is classified as a musician.

The other options describe locations in which one may place items or may be located in, but none is a container in its own right.<n>In particular, 'in shirt' could refer to the pocket of a shirt, but is likely to be a misunderstanding of the intended meaning of 'attache case'.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the second set of multiple choice questions.

But according to an online dictionary, Amsterdam is a city in the Netherlands (not a country), which indicates the term "the Netherlands" is sometimes used to refer to the country of the Netherlands, where Amsterdam is located.<n><n>Option "brussels" (D), unlike "Amsterdam," is a city that is indeed the capital of a country.

One that makes a lot of sense is "splats." Remember that because there's no indication that your answer is part of a sentence, it's possible that the answer could be an entire phrase. If so, it's good practice to look for the "full" answer. In this case, you know that "splat" is a noun and is the sound the poor cartoon character makes after landing off the cliff.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Many addicts turn to exercise to deal with their addictions, this is because it is a healthy way to do what? Choices:  A: condition heart B: expend energy C: laugh D: stretch E: weigh<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n><n>Answer: The first part of this question refers to the purpose of exercise. There aren't many options that don't involve exercise, but it turns out none of them are related to exercise, which is incorrect. The second part of this question does not appear to be looking for a specific consequence of exercise. This makes it likely that a consequence, rather than a purpose, is the correct answer.<n><n>The answers we've eliminated first are "condition heart" and "weigh" because they are not consequences and "stretch" because it says it's a consequence.<n><n>Out of the remaining answers, "exercise" and "expend energy", none of the options are what the question is looking for.<n><n>"healthy way to do what", which doesn't seem to mean anything, is a possibility, but the word "what" immediately excludes it, as well as some of the remaining choices.<n><n>So the final answer would be A: expend energy.<n><n>Input:What did the scientist want to do with the lab data? Choices: A: analyze it B: publish it C: present it D: test it E: summarize it<n>Output: Reason<n><n>A: analyse it (B) - analysing the data isn't an action, but rather an activity<n><n>B: publish it (A) - publishing the output of the study isn't an outcome of data analysis<n><n>The remaining options are C, D, E.<n><n>The first two options are likely eliminated because C) is about the presentation of data, which is done before data analysis, while D) is about testing data, which is done as part of analysis.<n><n>Out of those that remain, the answer has to be about the outcome of the analysis of the data. So the last two options are the most likely answers and the final answer is E) summarize it<n><n>Answer: The question is asking what the scientist wants to do. The options are all actions, but in reality, an action involves a doer and an object. The object is what the scientist wants. Therefore, we look at what is not said. The scientist doesn't want to do anything (A), nor does he want to publish, present, test, or summarize (B, C, D, and E). The options are a stretch, or the object of the

Choices:  A: downtown area B: container C: ocean floor D: the lost city of atlantis E: high school<n>Output:		The shop will give you cash for your purchases.Reasoning: The answers provided the the question:<n>* * "A shop will give you for your purchases." * "A shop will "give you" for your purchases." Reasoning: "For" is a preposition and is a part of the sentence. No other verb follows the preposition which means that the shop will provide you with an incentive in the form of "for"(the incentive) and something else.<n><n>* * "A ship will give you for your shopping." * "A shop "will give you" for your shopping." Reasoning: Once again the shop will give you something. "Will" is a verb and it denotes a future action. So the shop will provide you money for your shopping. You are given money "for shopping" i.e in exchange for your purchases.<n><n>* * the shop will provide what for your purchases. * the shop will provide "what for your purchases."Reasoning: The shop will give something in exchange for your purches.<n>If the shop will not give anything in exchange for your purcheses it means it is not a shop.<n>* The shop will give money for your purchasing. * The shop will give "money for" your purchasing. *  The shop will give you money for your purchasing "give" is a verb and the object of the action is in braces.So you are only given money if you make purchases.<n><n>### How to Play<n>To play the game, simply copy and paste the given question into the comment section of your answer.

John bought they because he knew that they would look good.  Where might they be installed? Choices:  A: kitchen B: pantry C: containing pots and pans D: in a flight E: mexico<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>1. Since cabinets are for the kitchen or pantry<n>2. Therefore the cabinets must be imported from either Mexico OR Spain.<n><n>Input: My best friend is the one who I spend most of my time with.  I have known him since elementary school. Where were we born? Choices: 12. 12 A: The Bahamas B: The Dominican Republic C: England D: Haiti E: Japan<n>Output: Reason :<n><n><n>1.The word "best" in the sentence suggests they have a strong bond.<n>2.The use of the words "I spent most of my time with" is used in the phrase "you and me against the world".<n>3.The words "I have known him since elementary" can probably be paraphrased to be " I have known him since preschool or kindergarten."<n><n>4.The use of the word "since" could be used to suggest the start of a relationship.<n><n>5.The phrase "with my bestie" can be interpreted to mean that the person can possibly be the opposite gender (i.e. the best way of showing that they can trust eachother is sharing secrets and stuff) and most likely that they are friends.<n><n>6.“My best friend is the person that I spend most of my times with.” - this means that the relationship is most probably strong enough to be labeled as a friend.<n><n>7.A "Best friend" can most of the time also be a lover (friend relationship), so from this sentence it could be said that I have known this person since elementary.<n><n>8. The phrase " the one that I spend most time with" can be paraphrased as " the person" " the one that I know the best" " the person I have trusted and loved (as a lover) the longest time."<n><n>9.From my conclusion, it can also be said that the relationship is most likely long term.<n><n>From all of the above conclusions, the relationship is most likely that of a female and a male and the one they met at the start of school.<n><n><n><n><n>Input: The first and most important aspect of a successful vacation is _________.

Choices:  A: fish market B: pet shop C: great outdoors D: river E: little mermaid<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>We can see that each answer option is one of the possible places where a blowfish might live.<n><n>"Fish market"(B),"pet shop"(C),"river"(D), and "Great Outdoors"(E) are all likely places where a blowfish could be found.<n><n>It is however highly unlikely for a blowfish to live in the "movie"(A) the Little Mermaid since it isn't a real setting.<n>Hence, the final answer is E.<n><n>Input: What is 71 + 7? Choices:  C: 98 E: 108<n>Output:Reasonning:We can see that the correct answer option is E, as it is the only one that is a three-digit number.All other options are less than 100.This clearly indicates that the correct answer choice is option E with value 108.<n> <n>Input: Where would you find the biggest flock of birds in the world? At the airport or during a parade?Choices:  E: Both A: At the airport B: During a parade<n>Output:Reasonng:Let's take an example below. Here we have a flock of 200 birds. So, we can clearly see that the flock is of the 200 birds rather it is 200 thousand or 200 million. Therefore, it can be easily seen that it is not correct to compare the number a flock of birds with the number of parking spaces at the airport.<n><n>Therefore, we can easily mark the answer option for E with 'Both' as the correct one.<n>Hence, we can clearly understand that the option for E is correct.<n><n>Input: We can tell if two people have the same genetic parent based on a DNA test.

Choices:  A: indigestion B: died C: illness D: feel better E: throwing up<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The purpose of this situation is self-determined: the poor man wants to know what he should do.<n>Option "died" (B) does not make sense in the context of the situation. It is extremely unlikely that a person eating would die as a result without any other information or details to suggest otherwise.<n><n>The next option "illness" (C) is likewise unlikely. The scenario does not suggest there are illnesses or any other health disorders caused by eating uncooked chicken.<n><n>The next two options, "indigestion" (A) and "throwing up" (E), are close but not accurate enough. The man could be suffering from either condition, but that is not what is asked.<n><n>The final option "feel better" (D) is the most specific in capturing the situation: when the man eats, he should *feel better* - not feel worse or sick to his stomach. This is the best answer.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is D: "feel better".

Choices:  A: overpopulation B: birth C: presents D: propagation E: fun<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>We now have multiple choice answer choices we can work with. In this case, we will start by eliminating answers that have nothing to do with children. Of course, not every answer choice will be relevant. Some will make perfect sense for the context of this question, while others will never be relevant. <n><n>Answer choice E (fun) is very relevant to children and the topic of reproduction. However, it doesn't have anything to do with birth. <n><n>Next, we consider the word "begets" in the prompt. What does “to beget” mean? In this context, “beget” refers to “the initial creation of.” This means answer choices that do not explain the process of birth would be eliminated. Since answer choices B (birth) and answer choices D (propagation), both fail to do this. Hence options are eliminated.<n><n>Next, as for answer choice A (overpopulation), some of it is clearly relevant to this context, but the word "overpopulation" also conveys the idea of an excess or superfluity. This suggests it is not the correct answer, since it is not about a new life coming into being. <n><n>Finally, we should consider the answer that is fully relevant: answer choice E (fun). This provides the entire context (new life), conveys the purpose (the fun!), and the exact process (giving). Hence, the answer is E: give birth<n><n>Input: The students are so excited to have their books back, but some of the students forgot what? Choices: A: where they placed B: to take notes C: to read D: class E: read<n>Output: Reasonin:<n><n>In this scenario, the students were excited to receive their books back. This means the correct answer choice should relate to a sense of anticipation and expectation. If there is anything that could help students feel excited, it would be a reminder of where they kept their books.<n><n>There is another relevant context here but a more specific reminder to the correct answer - that is to "read" (D)'s books. However, as a standalone answer, "to read" cannot carry much weight to the students. It sounds more like an instruction, where as the context suggests "to take notes". <n><n>So, we have narrowed down our answer choices to "take notes". <n>

Choices:  A: botanic garden B: flower garden C: backyard D: supermarket E: outdoors<n>Output:		Reason:<n>A botanic garden holds multiple varieties of all kinds of plants. In this case, a rose garden is located within it. Therefore, option A refers to this garden as the location where unusual types of roses are found.<n><n>Input:What country would you visit if your only means of transport was a bicycle? Choices: 	 A: the Netherlands B: Italy C: South Africa D: Sweden E: China<n>Output: Reason:- The Netherlands is often viewed as a bicycle-friendly tourist destination. This reflects a distinct lack of pollution and traffic noise. So option B, "the Netherlands," is the most logical pick among the given choices.<n><n>Input:Which of these places wouldn't I visit with the family? Choices:  B: the zoo A: the grocery store D: the movies C: the mall E: amusement park<n>Output: ReasonThe term "amusement park" refers to a destination that offers fun and excitement to visitors. It is not a place you would bring a small child to in order to save money.<n><n>The given options offer examples of places a small child would enjoy, such as the zoo ("B," the zoo), and the amusement park ("D," the amusement park).<n><n>The mall (C) is a common location for high-end shopping. Also, a typical visit to the movies (A) costs approximately $ 10. Therefore, the mall or a movie outing is more expensive than visiting the zoo.<n><n>Since the mall, the movies, and the amusement park are more expensive and not suitable for a small child, the safest option would be to visit the grocery store (B), which is more cost-effective.<n>So the correct answer is B: the zoo<n><n>Input: Why doesn't the US have a royal family?<n>Output: Reason-<n>It's common knowledge that the government in the US is a democracy. Therefore, it is considered important for the leaders of that government to be elected by the people. There is a direct link between the leadership and the common people, unlike in the case of a traditional monarchy, where the throne is passed down through a line of succession.<n><n><n>In other words: there is no place in the US for a monarchy, since the government follows a democratic

Choices:  A: at the zoo B: south carolina C: hen house D: louisiana E: arkansas<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The clue lies in the question's reference to the phrase "in a land locked, southern state". If we have in mind that we are indeed in a land-locked southern state, any answer that does not include a reference to the fox in question will not be correct.<n>This leaves us with three other remaining options - south carolina, arkansasand louisiana.<n>Among these three options, choosing arkansas will immediately result in a wrong answer because "Hen House" is the reference for a place where poultry are kept. Lousiana is out because it is simply too far away from the land-locked state. The remaining option is south carolina. Choosing this results in an accurate answer.<n><n>Input:In which state is San Francisco? Choices: A: new york B: new jersey C: pennsylvania D: ohio E: ohio<n>Output: Reason<n>While the clue doesn't provide any information related to San Francisco, it does offer additional information that gives us insight into where San Francisco is likely to be.<n>There are a number of landmarks in the eastern US that are connected to San Francisco such as the Golden Gate bridge, Lombard street, and Pier 39. As San Francisco is located on the west coast, and we are given that we are in the land of the landlocked, it is likely that we are in the Midwestern or eastern US states. This means that we are in states where Ohio could likely be. It is also located in states that have other major cities that San Francisco may be connected to like Philadelphia or Boston.<n>Which means New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are out. Ohio is the only answer that makes sense here.<n><n>Input:According to the clue, the state is landlocked, in the lower case, and in a different state than where the fox is. Which of the following states meets these conditions? Choices: A & B only C & D only A, B, C, and D <n>Output: Reason What do you think?<n><n>Situation 1<n>We know that the state is south in the landlocked state, and we know it is the opposite of the fox. The only options that are in the landlocked states are the lowercase states. New Jersey is opposite the Fox because it is the furthest south state that is landlocked and both

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

Choices:  A: hill B: gorge C: sandplain D: cliff E: mountain<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To start, Sam is a character who's looking for a particular thing: a "giant hole" in the "plain." Because it's a plain, not a mountain, the obvious answer is "A: hill." <n><n>However, "hill" (A) is the incorrect answer, because a hill (typically) is steep. However, this plain is flat and featureless, making it "a bit dull." Choosing an option that doesn't describe the plain seems implausible.<n><n>Next, the options "B: gorge" (C) and "D: cliff" (D) may appear plausible because of how deep these features may seem, but there's a problem with each.<n>First, a "gorge" (B) is a landform usually created by the erosion of a river.  Because it's not a water body, "A: plain" (C) is the most plausible option because it is flat. <n><n>Second, "D: cliff," a high escarpment along the edge of a plateau, seems to fit at first, but there is no evidence that this flat plain extends over the edge of a plateaus.<n><n>As a result, the only remaining option is "E: mountain" (E). A mountain is simply a lofty feature on the land; the only other answer that fits the context of this scenario. Choosing "A: hill" (C) would be correct.<n>So, the final answer is E : Mountain<n>Input:There were some interesting letters in the spam folder today.  If people receive this type of email, what is it called? Choices: A: Spam B: Phishing C: Phishing D: Fake E: Spam<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>This question presents a variety of common terms used to refer to "spam." So, if you're unsure of the exact definition for any of them, just skip it to the next question.<n><n>In this scenario, "A: Spam B: Fake C: Phishing" (B) and option "C: Phishing D: Phishing" (C) may appear to both be valid answers, but the text "type" implies that this is a person's email and refers to emails that are "in one's inbox."<n><n>The word
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:After going for run you have a sense of what? Choices:  A: satisfaction B: flying C: sweating D: falling down E: trip<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, the scenario invokes the sense of having participated in a certain activity after going for a run.<n>The runner then goes on to describe that activity. "Satisfaction" (B) is out of the question, as going for a run wouldn't by nature result in a "sense of satisfaction".<n>"Sweating" (C) is a physical reaction to the physical exertion of going for a run, and so also excludes this option. <n>"Falling down" (D) is a risk that comes with physical activity, but it doesn't necessarily have to be one that applies to running.<n><n>"Trip" (E) refers to an incident or accidental occurrence, and it's unlikely that that phrase refers to any such event in the context of running.<n><n>The only remaining choice that fits the sense is "trip". The final answer, therefore, is E: trip.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What will you need to do to decide whether to be seeing artifacts? Choices:  A: learning B: painful memories C: thinking D: awe inspiring E: pleasure<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to analyze the question, which leads to answer A: learning. Learning is needed to "learn whether seeing the artifact was in fact seeing".<n><n>The second step is to disambiguate the purpose for learning. If "learning" was the purpose for the task at hand, than the purpose would be to know whether these artifacts are real. If "doing math" is needed, the answer must be "Doing Math".<n>By this logic "A - learning" does not fit the purpose "learn whether the images shown were actually visible"<n><n>The same logic applies to "C: thinking" and "B: memories". In both cases, "learn whether the images...were actually visible" would become the purpose, while "thinking" and "memories" would then be the methods to achieve this purpose. Both "thinking" and"memories" would violate the rules set forth in "C"<n><n>As "memories" and "thinking" are rejected, answer "B: thinking" has to be a choice. There is then a choice of "E: pleasure" or "D: awe inspiring". The second part of "D: awe-inspiring" states that there is pleasure for awe inspiring. So "D" must be one of the available choices.<n><n>As "D" has now become an available choice, the logical answer is "D: Awe Inspiring"<n><n>Input: The researchers had been given data and were to be analyzed to which? Choices:  M: be aware of C: get to feel E: be aware of A: feel good

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:A lonely man committed suicide, why would he do that? Choices:  A: suffering B: he was happy C: avoid problems D: unhappy E: end pain<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to consider when answering this multiple choice question is the context of the question itself. The question presents a man who committed suicide, which implies that he was suffering or unhappy. This eliminates options "he was happy" (B) and a "avoid problems" (C).<n>The man's motivation can only be further interpreted based on his state of mind - "he was unhappy" and "he was suffering" (those cannot be disregarded).<n><n>Options D and E can be safely ruled out. The choice "avoid problems" is not likely, as suicide is a drastic action that often is taken as a response to intolerable problems. And the choice "end pain" is unlikely, because the question's statement asserts that the man was miserable "for many years". So these cannot be accepted.<n><n>This leaves us with only one option - the choice of "he was unhappy", because it is the most logical fit for the information provided by the question.<n><n><n>Input:I've met my girlfriend, we've been dating for 7 years and we're planning to get married in the summer, I couldn't be more exited. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever known and I love her with all my heart. What I don't like, she spends too much money. I thought we were gonna share expenses but she thinks she knows better all the time...  what should I do? Choices: 	A: she is the woman of my dreams  B: that's not a problem  C: ask her for an additional income if it's really an issue  D: you have to start planning for your honeymoon  E: get married anyway she is worth  the whole world<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The question presents a dilemma between two options. Option A "I've met my dream girl" is clearly incorrect if you consider the context of the question as a whole. The man has not met his girlfriend as she is not a newcomer to his life, but the subject of a relationship for 7 years. This means, option A is not an answer to the question. <n><n>Option B "I don't think I should worry about that" is the most logical and straightforward answer but has no specific motivation -

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I am suffering from boredom, and I want to do something with a dictionary, what would help? Choices:  A: do crossword puzzle B: see art C: give up D: grocery shop E: play chess<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, the only possible scenario for option A (play crossword puzzle) would be if the dictionary were part of a crossword puzzle. However, even then, it wouldn't help to "do something with a dictionary" in that situation.<n><n>Option B (see art) makes sense if the dictionary contains images or illustrations alongside definitions and explanations. However, if the dictionary is purely text-based, it doesn't make sense to use it alongside to look at artwork.<n><n>Option C (give up) is impossible, as the task of "doing something with a dictionary" would have already been completed. It can't be discarded or reversed at this point, nor can it be thrown away.<n><n>Option D (grocery shop) is similarly inaccurate. The task of "doing" something with a dictionary does not involve shopping for food - the two concepts should not go together.<n><n>Option E (play chess) is also out of place. Chess is a game that requires some form of thinking and planning, but analyzing the dictionary doesn't require those skills.<n><n>The final remaining option is "play chess". The dictionary can be used as a reference for words and phrases relevant to chess, and the game can be played using those terms. This helps to "do" something with a dictionary and can be used to alleviate boredom.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: play chess.<n><n>Input:When I first started playing chess, I had a lot to catch up on. My instructor told me that in order to learn, I should focus on _____. Choices: A: strategies B: new tactics C: rules D: challenges E: mistakes<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>Again, we're looking at the context of the situation and the tasks involved.<n><n>In this case, "strategies", which would be gained from the experience and knowledge of the instructor, are likely what the student needs to catch up. <n><n>"New tactics" (B), on the other hand, seem out of place - especially since the instructor says to focus on the student's strengths and what he's already good at.<n><n>"Rules" (C) seem like an incorrect response, as the student will learn the rules

Choices:  A: expect to die B: believe in god C: stay in D: watch movies E: eat corn<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "believe in god" (B) would be reasonable if this was about a researcher examining the impact of people's religiosity on health. But if we're asking about an individual's general choices, it doesn't qualify. Similarly, "stay in" (D), while commonly used by certain individuals, isn't a universally common option. Similarly, "watch movies" (E) is reasonable to some degree, but it's unreasonable on the whole scale.<n><n>The only answer that remains is "expect to die" (A). People expect to die, which is why they choose to eat food that's easy to eat and digest. While this might not be as appealing as the other options, it's the most accurate choice because it fits the context of the question and answers what the writer is asking about.<n>So the answer is A: Expect to die<n><n>Input:Who invented the internet? Choices: <n> A: the US military B: the CIA C: China D: Bill Gates E: Stephen Hawking<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The option "the US military" (A) would make sense if this question was about a researcher looking for information about how data is gathered by organizations or governments. But that's not the question the writer is asking about - we're not talking about the methods of gathering data but about who made and discovered the internet. So we can eliminate this option.<n><n>Option "the CIA" (B) makes sense because the CIA is a notorious organization known for its secret missions and operations. While it's true that the CIA has its hand in information gathering and data analysis, it doesn't feel relevant or credible when answering a question about the history of the internet.<n><n>"China" (C) makes sense as a possible answer, but it's a rather generic country. That's why we can eliminate this option, too.<n><n>"Bill Gates" (D) is out of the picture because that's just the name of a famous businessman. Aside from being unrelated to the topic at hand, it still wouldn't make sense in the context of this question because Microsoft's internet browser - Internet Explorer - didn't become commonplace until 1995, which is a few years after

Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Because screwing a chain ring onto something suggests fixing something, choice B (a wall outlet fixture) can be eliminated. The rest can be narrowed down by noting that "wall outlet fixture" in general is not something one "screws" on.<n>Choice E, a motorcycle, has been eliminated because "screwing a chain ring onto [a motorcycle]" would make no sense. Only choice A (a necklace) remains, which would be the correct answer.<n>So the final answers is A: necklace<n><n>Input:There is a 75% chance that I will be able to finish the project.

To determine the mass of the watermelon including the peel, one would have to know the mass of the peels on the entire watermelon, which may not be possible. So answer E is incorrect. Answer F is incorrect because one would not have any peels to determine the mass of from the sample of one slice. A more direct and effective method to determine the mass of the whole watermelon would be to subtract the mass of all the removed seeds from the mass of the whole whole watermelon.

Choices:  A: home team B: present C: at home D: come back E: charming<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>The most logical reason to take away from this question is that Billy left because he didn't want  to stay where his parents were fighting. The other choices are either irrelevant (home - which suggests he did not go away, A) or are not clearly in favor of him departing. <n><n>The remaining choices may have relevance to the scenario, but it's not clear if they are intended as reasons for Billy's departure, and they may simply be a reflection of what the other party is saying. For example, the response in (A) could be part of Billy's parents' explanation, rather than his own response.<n><n>In conclusion, Option E - better understanding - is clearly the most logical choice.<n><n>Input: A scientist came home and the door locked, so the scientist began to climb the tree. He could not understand why the answer to the question, because he wanted to do what? Choices: A: gain more knowledge B: gain more strength<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The answer to this question is (D). In order for (A) to be an option, the scientist would have to be trying to gain **more knowledge**, not simply knowledge. Therefore, he would have to have some existing knowledge and be trying to get more.  <n><n>Similarly, (B) could be considered if the scientist were trying to gain more strength, but the answer given implies that he was trying to gain more knowledge.<n><n>Therefore, the only logical option is (D): "Do better" - as the scientist was trying to figure out the answer to the question."<n>

Choices:  A: small B: underground C: high D: huge E: tall<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>Option A: the Empire state building could be a small building compared to others; however it could not be an underground building nor a high building. A high building by definition is one taller than buildings around it. So the first three options are eliminated.<n><n>Option B: This one is a no brainer, underground buildings have no height. That leaves us with a huge building or a tall one.<n><n>Since the question does not ask for the tallest structure in the world, an Empire State building could probably be one of them. A tall building by definition needs to be one that is taller than buildings around its surrounding area. However an underground building in New York is hard to find given its hilly terrain. So we eliminate option A and B.<n><n>Only a huge building or a huge building would suffice for the Empire State building, which is option D.<n>

Choices:  Yellow : A: Person’s name B: Gender C: Job Title D: Relationship E: None of the above<n>Output: Reason.<n>None of the above says that it does define  person’s name, job title, and relationship  but not a gender which means in the question it does include gender.<n><n>Input: In your class, you have your choice of a blue pen or a green pen, but not a red pen, or a purple pen. That’s a limited choice. If you had even more choices, it would be what? Choices: A: Unlimited	 B: Restricted	 C: Infinite	 D: Countable E: Uncountable<n>Output: Reason;<n>Countable: A countable noun is a count noun. That is, the noun can have an indefinite number of instances (or members): "the water is running," or "the children are playing." For instance, if you say "the flowers are beautiful," the last word refers to a number of individuals and thus, it is a countable noun. For instance, water and children, because these represent a number of people, are countable nouns. The number of flowers is not specified. You could have flowers blooming in fields for generations, so the number of instances of flowers is infinite. In mathematics, the set of all countable nouns is called the natural numbers.<n><n>Countable:<n>The number of students in our class is finite and unknown<n>

Choices: A: take the compliment B: accept C: deny D: tell you're not E: tell the friend to keep quite<n>Output:Reason:<n>In this scenario, "you're bald" is the most likely outcome, as is "go bald." However, if you disagree with the truth, you most likely will not like to accept the result. As such,  option A, "accepting the compliment," seems like a more accurate response.<n><n>Input:  The old man has run out of wood, he will need to what? Choices:(A) cut down a tree B) plant a tree (C) get a permit D) hunt a deer (E) seek out an engineer<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>As for the options, option A should be the correct option, because he needed another source of wood, and it is natural to cut off new trees for the old man. Meanwhile, option B should definitely rule out as inappropriate, since the old man should not be planting trees for himself when he has already run out of wood.<n>Option (D) should rule out as incorrect, because while one can hunt a deer for a source of wood, a hungry deer would not be able to meet the needs of a man in that condition.<n>Finally, option (E) should rule out as irrelevant, because while an engineer may come in useful for the old man, an engineer is unlikely to be able to help him in terms of wood.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: georgia B: tree C: nature D: under the rocks E: france<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>When dealing multiple choice questions, the first step is to understand the prompt. In this case, the scenario describes a snake that is either an American or a cottonmouth. But only the latter (B) answers the question "georgia" in Georgia, a state found in the southeastern region of the US. If the prompt provided extra details (such as the snake's home country or its continent), then you would have more to go on than the mere fact that it was a cottonmouth and from where?<n><n>The next step is to eliminate irrelevant options. Here, the choice "from where" is irrelevant because the prompt only lists a single location - Georgia. However, options such as "nature" (D) and "under the rocks" (E) are irrelevant because they do not address a particular location at all.<n><n>The choice "American" (A) also falls into this category, as it is not tied to a particular location but rather gives a vague definition of the snake's species.<n><n>The final option is "georgia." While this answer is relevant, it is not the best option because it only mentions the location of the snake, not its species. Therefore, for consistency and to remain unbiased, the correct answer is "georgia" (A).<n>So the final answer was georgia<n><n><n>---<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question based on the choices below.<n><n>What is the correct answer for the above question? <n><n>1.

The answer is 53.748<n><n>8. The answer is 68.952<n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>To begin, the first question should be to understand the prompt. The scenario describes a snake as either an American cottonmouth or a cottonmouth - the name of a species of snake. The term "cottonmouth" gives more information about the snake, as it is a name given to one species in American herpetology. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer.<n><n>The next step should be to eliminate

He could see clouds when he looked out his window.  Where might he live? Choices:  A: in books B: radio station C: city D: tower E: medieval castle<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The context of the problem refers to James as "living in the top of the tower," which implies that he's not on top. So the answer choice that states he lived in the top isn't a feasible option A: in books, which refers to where the story of James taking place is located.<n>This isn't a correct answer because the context is about where James actually lives.<n><n>The answer choice that refers to James living in the radio station is incorrect E: medieval castle, because the context states that James can see clouds when he looks out his window. That means that James doesn't live in the medieval castle. <n><n>The answer choice C: city, is correct because James can see clouds when looking out the window of his tower. If James was in a city, clouds wouldn’t be visible to see.<n><n>Input: How many squares are there in the following rectangular array? Choices: <n>A: 27 B: 11 C: 0 D: 28 E: 12<n>Output:Explanation:<n><n>To answer the question you must count how many squares in the following matrix. The array has 7 × 8 cells. There are three types of cells. Each cell can be either empty, a '1' or a '2'.<n>Therefore, the number of possible 8-digit values is 384 × 384. And if the empty cells are counted as '0', the answer will be 8 × 104,000= 1,280,000<n>So the answer is E. D is not a correct answer because the number of possible combinations is 384^2, but not 384<n><n>Output: Explanation:<n><n>This is a very simple question. To determine the answer choose every box that is filled in and then count all the boxes that have 1's and 2's on each side. To determine the answer to this question you need to know that there are 14 blue squares and 24 pink squares in all. Therefore the answer would be E.<n><n>Input: What type of problem is this?

Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n><n>The first step in answering this question is to identify the context of the check. A "person writes a check" suggests that the check was received by a clerk in some capacity. Therefore, the answer must be in the context of a clerk receiving a check.<n><n>The next step is to narrow down the possible locations where the clerk might put the check. Answer options "cash register" (A), "pay envelope" (D), and "box" (E) would be reasonable; "desk drawer" (B) is clearly out of context, as it is a personal item rather than a professional tool.<n><n>The final step is to determine which answer is the most accurate, and therefore the most likely location for a clerk to place a check after receiving it. Out of the three possible options, "pay envelope" is the only one that fits the context of a clirk recieving a check. Therefore, the answer is "pay envelope."<n><n>Input: Who writes more than one type of essay, a writer or a poet? Choices:  a writer, a poet<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>This type of question is known as a logical reasoning question. Unlike a multiple-choice question, there are no answer choices to weed out. In order to answer this question, you must have a clear understanding of the concepts being tested and the rules that govern each type of writing. While both essayists and poets write "types" of writing, essays and poetry are two different categories that use different writing forms. An essay is a written work on a certain topic, usually one that is debated, while poetry is a form of literary art that uses rhythm and rhyme. In short, an essayist writes essays, while a poet writes poetry.<n><n>Input: If the sum of the angles of a parallelogram is 360 degrees, what is their measure in degrees for each angle of the quadrilateral? Choices: 180, 180,180,1080<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>Here we are given an information that a sum of angles of a parallegram is 36o.

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>This question is asking us to look at the phrase and the meaning of the words "everyone" and "feeling".<n>In this context, "everyone" does not mean literally everyone. It refers to a large number of people - perhaps even the entire human race. In other words, it's possible for a large number of people to feel love at the same time.<n><n>The word "feeling" can also be interpreted differently than its simple definition. Here, it refers to an intense emotion, rather than a simple, fleeting feeling. It's possible for a number of people to feel deep, intense emotions at the same time. This option would then be correct.<n><n>Final Answer: D: painful<n><n>Input: It's a dog's life Choices:  A. One that is easy B.One that is worthwhile C.One that is enjoyable D.One that is unpleasant E.One that is short<n>Output: Reasonings: Context: From the context, the statement is true because a dog’s life is short.

There was a target on the wall for him to bounce against.  Where might he be? Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "playroom" (B) is the most likely location here. Bouncing a ball against a target on a wall sounds like the scenario is taking place in the playroom - a place where children play and interact with their toys.<n>Option "closet" (E) does not make sense here. The wording of the question mentions a target to be bounced against, suggesting that there is a spot where this happens. <n><n>Option "toy box" (C) is incorrect because Billy bouncing against a wall implies him using the ball to hit the target against. This might also happen in a playroom, but it's not the only location where such an activity could take place. <n><n>Option A, "pool table" (A), is incorrect because it's not even close to a possible location. "Bouncing the ball off the wall" can be interpreted as using the ball to hit something against the wall. Such a scenario has nothing to do with the pool table.

Choices:  A: supermarket B: motel C: at hotel D: shampoo bottle E: hair salon<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The option "motel" (B) makes no sense given the context that the delivery man is delivering a crate of shamopo. Hotels don't use shampoo.<n><n>The option "at hotel" (D) similarly doesn't make sense because hotels would not be buying shampoo in the first place.<n><n>The option that could be viable is shampoo bottles (C). Shampoo bottles are the place where one would use shampoo, as opposed to hotel rooms, where one would not be. This would be sufficient for the logic behind this question to align: "going through a lot of it."<n><n>The other option "hair saloons" (E) is problematic since salons are not places where shampoo would be used as readily as a hotel or bottle would.<n><n>So the correct answer finally, is C: shampoo battles.<n><n>Incorrect input / output:<n><n>Input:The girl ran to school, she had trouble getting her homework done what?

Likewise, the other option "a lot of gum" (B) is nonsensical in an educational setting.<n><n>The option remaining is "a lot of trouble" (X). Though these words are synonymous, the option is an unnatural way to describe the situation given the context.<n><n>Finally the correct option is "a lot of difficulty" (E).<n><n>

But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:A musician is most likely to perform a concerto for clarinet with what type of group?

Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>Option "drink water" (C) doesn't make sense because cats don't typically drink water. The option "live many years" (E) is also incorrect because it contradicts the statement "what would you normally expect a **cat** to say".<n><n>Option "see king" (A) could be a misinterpretation of the phrase "a cat". The writer may be attempting to say the phrase "see king" as a play on the phrase "look at me", which is also a cat-related phrase, used in an attempt to get attention from another human. While this is technically sound from a grammatical standpoint, it doesn't accurately represent what the writer was trying to convey.<n><n>The option "meow" (B), the common cat sound, is the correct answer because it is the most likely thing you would expect a cat to say.<n>So the finals answer is B: meow<n><n>### Input: Your friend invites you to her house for dinner. She asks what your favorite food will be. Choices:  A. French onion soup  B. Shrimp  C. Fruit salad  D. Stuffed bell peppers  E. Pizza<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Option "frog" (E), while hilarious, doesn't make sense as a choice for favorite dish because frogs don't eat pizza.<n><n>Option "stuffed bell peppers" (D) is a strange option, because bell peppers are usually filled with meat, not vegetables.<n><n>Options "French onion soup" (A), "shrimp" (B), and "pizza" (E) are all plausible responses because they are all foods commonly enjoyed by humans.<n><n>In the end, it is hard to say what the exact favorite dish of a person is without them verbally claiming it as theirs. Thus, the correct answer is E.<n>So the final answers are A and E<n>

Also there is no other meaning to the word 'nation" in the question. Now taking out all the confusing words such as 'in', 'part' and 'world', we have the core context "Turkey is a country/nation."<n><n>Moving on to the option D which says, "A: asia minor B: asia C: provide meat D: balkan peninusla", which are 4 geographical places mentioned in the question. The question asked for 'where' not 'what', therefore, these options will eliminate the question.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is A: Asia minor<n><n>Input: How many hours is the length of light of a day? Choices:  B: 24 C: 24 hours D: 2 hours E: 216 hours<n>Output: Reason 1: The word 'length' in this question refers to the duration of time, therefore, it cannot be the correct option with respect to its meanings.<n>Reason 2: We can read antonyms of length in the dictionary:<n><n>Antonyms of 'length'<n>briefness : shortness<n>concision : brevity : succinctness<n>fewness : paucity : scantiness<n>limitation : restraint : shortage : restriction<n>shortness : curtness : terse : abruptness<n><n>So all the choices given as answers, except for (D) would be wrong.<n>Thus, the correct answer is 'E': 216 hours.<n><n>- Input: Which of the following is not a method used by managers?

Choices:  A: idaho B: casserole C: new hampshire D: root cellar E: ireland<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question is a little trickier than the previous one.<n><n>The first step to answering this question is determining the kind of information the question is asking for.<n><n>Here, the question is being narrowly specific.<n>It is asking for a European country that excels in its potato industry. But it is not as broad as asking to generalize about which country is famous for growing potatoes.<n><n>So, the options "i'daho" (A), "Casserole" (B) and, "Root Cellar" (C) are eliminated because they cannot answer the specific, narrow question.<n><n>The next step is to look on map to see if there is any European country in the potato industry. There is none. Thus, "Ireland" (D) is out since it is in North America, not in Europe.<n><n>The remaining two options are "Italy" (E) and "France" (F). Since "F" is missing on the above answer key, we can go ahead and eliminate it.<n><n>We can also rule out "Italy" (F) because it is not famous for its potato, and this question is specific to potato.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is F, France or E, Ireland<n><n>Input:How will you get to the other side?

Choices:  A: regret B: automobile accidents C: drunk driving D: talking nonsense E: talk intelligently<n>Output:		Reason:Reasoning:<n><n>This questions seems to be asking a trivia question based on a common phrase. The wording of this situation leaves open a number of possible outcomes.<n><n>Option "automobile accidents" (C) doesn't seem to be a possible outcome. The fact that the person is inebriated doesn't imply that they'll be more likely to get in a car accident.<n><n>Option "drunk driving" (D) seems to be too literal of an interpretation of the phrase "lose control of your speech." Losing control of one's speech would indicate a tendency to say certain things, and then backtrack or correct oneself. This doesn't imply drunk driving.<n><n>The correct answer is (E): "talk intelligently." The phrase "lose control of speech" is often used to describe someone who might slur their words or stutter. But that's not the only meaning of "control of your speech." And thus, they would be saying that after being inebriated, a person will tend to speak in an intelligent and coherent fashion.<n><n>Input:Which of the following is the most obvious inference that can be made about the above situation? Choices:  - A. She needs a new job. B. She might be interested in a job in marketing. C. They need her in finance. D. She is a good cook. E. They want her in finance.<n>Output: Reasonable: Reasoning: Reason:<n><n>There are multiple possible implications to be drawn from this situation. The job title "Personal Chef" implies that someone is being hired to cook for other people. That makes the logical choice "A: She needs a new job" unlikely (D).<n><n>The inference that she's a "good cook" (E) seems unlikely as well, as the context doesn't indicate why the chef is being hired in the first place.<n><n>The inference that the chef would be given a job in finance is also not supported by the text. The restaurant owner says, "I've had such a lot of cooks lately, but this one really knows how to treat people right." The key phrase here is "cook." That implies that the chef will still be working in the kitchen, which is a far cry from being given a position in upper management

But it's not.<n><n>* "eat plants" is the only viable option at this point. So that would be the answer. So the final answer is E eat plants<n>```

Choices:  A: eat ice cream B: have sex C: sit down D: make mistakes E: hear sounds<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The phrase "they want to reproduce" implies the existence of desire in pursuing that action. That narrows the field of options to 3: 1) Eat ice cream, 2) have sex, 3) sit down.<n>But the question demands something the human body does (i.e. a physical act) rather than a non-physical act, such as wanting to reproduce.<n><n>Then, what would a human do to reproduce?

Choices: 🍎🍎𝒂 3 🍌🎙🎺🎷 A: Tapas B: Aircraft C: Boats D: Sitting still<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The option "Tapas" is incorrect because they go up and down. The option "boats" is incorrect for the same reason.<n>The option "Aircraft" seems like a good choice, but it does come down - it land eventually on the runway during flight.<n><n>It left "Sitting still." Now, that's an odd one. Whenever we sit down, we definitely come down. So how does sitting still fit the description?<n>It's about perspective. Sitting still is an unusual example of going up without coming down. If you sit down in a moving vehicle, such as a bus, you will go up a little bit, but then come down when the bus goes lower in altitude.<n>But if you sit still in one place, there's no other motion that causes you to come down. Therefore, there's no sense of up in the moment.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is indeed B: Sitting still!<n><n>Input: I want: what will you give me? Choices:  C: You and me B: Sleeping  A: Help B: Hugs And kisses<n>Output: Reasonning:<n><n>The first clue is the use of the word "I" instead of "we" to refer to a collection of people. This indicates that the question applies to one person and that the answer should focus on what that one person wants.<n>The remaining options are all physical objects.

Choices:  A: injuries B: fatigue C: traffic jams D: tired E: accidents<n>Output:		Answer:<n><n>Reasoning: Let's break down the question first. What are the possible outcomes of being reckless by driving fast? <n><n>* Injuries: This would be bad, but we shouldn't be too surprised since you're recklessly driving. <n>* Fatigue: This seems to be the most logical answer. <n>* Traffic jams: Although this may happen, it wouldn't be a direct result of reckless driving. <n>* Tired: This seems to be too general of an answer. <n>* Accidents: It's obvious that being reckless on the road will lead to car accidents. If your driving was reckless, then you would have more accidents than someone who was driving responsibly. <n><n>The answer to the question is therefore B: Fatigue<n><n>Output: The answer is D: A person. <n><n>The question states, _What does ‘X + Y = Z’ mean to a person?_ It is clear that ‘X + Y = <n>Z’ here is in reference to something like an arithmetic equation. <n><n>Therefore, ‘a person’ is the most accurate answer. The key here is to determine the main noun of a sentence and then determine other applicable nouns that suit the sentence.  <n><n>A: The answer here would need to be something associated with a person. An inanimate object is not something that a person can interact with or describe in this manner. <n>B: In this case, the sentence refers to a mathematical formula, such as ‘adding’. Thus, it would be incorrect to attribute feelings and emotions to math. For example, it would be wrong to say ‘Math is angry’ or ‘Math is sad’, whereas that would fit with the above description of ‘a person’ as the main noun in the sentence. <n>C: Although ‘the person who is riding a bike’ would have technically been grammatically correct, we can deduce that this does not suit the above context. That’s because in a scientific/mathematical context, people can be replaced with the noun ‘particles’. For example, ‘particles interact’ or ‘particles feel’.   <n><n>D: The answer would need to be something related to arithmetic. From the above descriptions, we know that ‘A person’ is the correct main noun of

Choices:  A: trouser leg B: sick bay C: own home D: petting zoo E: mother's hair<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Options A and B are unreasonable because the attention of a ferret usually draws from food and other animals.<n><n>Option C is unreasonable because a ferret would receive lots of attention in its own home.<n><n>Option D is unreasonable because ferrets are usually caged pets that aren't allowed to wonder or roam freely. This would not be the reason of their attention.<n><n>So the final answer should be B.<n><n>Input:What is an area of law that was once the province of a barrister? Choices:  _________ A: Criminal law B: Civil law C: Admiralty law D: Family law E: Inheritance law F: Employment law G: Tax law<n>Output: Reason for answer<n><n>Options  A and B are unacceptable as it must concern a barrister’s role. The options exclude that a barrister can be involved in criminal, civil, admiralty or family law.<n><n>Options C and D are excluded as they are irrelevant to the role of a barrister.<n><n>Options F and G are excluded as they suggest that a ‘barrister’ is not relevant to ‘the law’.<n><n>So the answer should be G.<n><n>Input: A worm is a type of roundworm. What group of animals does this sentence belong to? Choices:  B: round worms C: bugs D: mammals E: beasts F: rats<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Option C is not possible because “want to belong group of animals” that does not have be a “worm”.<n><n>Options B, E and F can be eliminated as they does not make sense, as we will not get a “bug” as a group or a “rat” as an animal.<n><n>Option A is not possible as “worm” does not exist by itself it is a sub group of animals. If we say a “type of a roundworm” (B) is “the worms”<n><n>Option D should be the answer because it makes the most sense and has the proper use of English.<n><n>Input:The best time to apply sunscreen is early in the day before the sun gets high.

Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n>Output:		Reason:<n>There are three criteria on which an answer to this question can be judged: relevance, context-basedness and concreteness.<n><n>1. Relevance:<n><n>The question invites you to reason that there are certain tasks that animals can "only do if they were born to do it". This phrase has a rather philosophical ring to it, and can be found all over TV commercials and other media.<n><n>Thus, it is important to focus on the connotations of the phrase "doing something well", which means that it implies mastery.<n><n>2. Context-basedness:<n><n>The question asks us to explain what a certain type of animals does not do well. So, we can say with almost certainty that it is not "doing something well" - otherwise, they would not be bad at it.<n><n>3. Concreteness:<n><n>The question also asks about activities that require a certain kind of "know-how". "Swimming well" here means that the animals are good at swimming, while "passing water" means passing urine. Since the question refers to swimming, we can say with certainty that it cannot be referring to the passing of urine.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is B: bathe.<n>

Choices:  A: opened B: closed C: found at shower D: falling down E: locked<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to note is that the "owned" must be a plural, as the context suggests that there's more than one cat. But all options except “falling down” (E), are singular, implying that the kittens have just one door that they can enter by.<n><n>The second thing to note is that a kitten that's already grown up to its full size would not need to "get used" to their own space - so the option "gotten used to" (B) is ruled out.<n><n>In the context, the cat owner isn't talking about the bed itself, but the space around it. Thus, the cat isn't allowed to climb onto the bed.<n><n>It's possible to reach the ground from the bed via a ladder, which isn't something that a cat should be climbing on. The "ground" here refers to the floor, which must be implied from the context.<n><n>But the cat can still reach the floor via a ladder - thus, the correct answer is "found at shower" (D)<n><n>For full correct solution, follow the link<n>

We know that it is Monday at 11/28.<n><n>The question is asking what day of the week it is. It could be Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.<n><n>The first thing we must note is the fact that we already know it is Monday and that today is December 21. We can be absolutely certain that it isn’t a Wednesday, as Wednesdays have already passed. The only days remaining after this are Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.<n><n>We then have to use logic to figure out which day it isn’t. If it were Friday, it wouldn’t be Monday either, since Friday and Monday are 2 days apart. We can cross off that option.<n><n>Now we need to narrow it down to only one choice. We are looking for 2 dates that are next to each other. Since today is December 28 and it is Monday, it is also

Choices:  A: cause spots on leaf B: healthy C: wellness D: ball stopped E: cure<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>A disease is spreading rapidly, and researchers are scrambling to understand its cause. To determine the cause, they'd need evidence that could lead to a cure. Therefore, a good answer would imply the term "cure" is desperately sought for.<n><n>One could potentially consider "cure" (D), but the wording of the question states "healthy" (C) and "wellness" (D). Both of these terms indicate a positive state of health, which contradicts the connotation of "cure" for a disease. <n><n>Next, "cause spots on leaf" (B) is a strong clue that points to the disease. For example, one may find a pattern or commonality among spots seen on leaves, which could be the clue to finding the cause. <n><n>Next on our list is "ball stopped". Although a helpful indication, it doesn't apply here. <n><n>Therefore, the correct answer "cure" (E) is best suited as a plausible answer.<n><n>Input: Scientists are investigating a mystery, what will they eventually discover?

We should determine what this mystery might be, so we can reason out potential answers. <n><n>Given that scientists are exploring a mystery, they may want to discover an answer or find something new they didn't know before they started investigating. <n><n>Option "a new theory" (B) would be a logical response.<n><n>Even though option B has a vague explanation, it's plausible given the context of the question, which states that they'd "discover" something.  The next clue is the use of the word "their" (D) - this could hint at discovering an answer to a problem they've been trying to solve earlier on.<n><n>Next is the phrase "a formula" (E), which seems less related to the subject matter of finding an answer to a mystery.

Choices:  A: telephone network B: freeway C: company D: wall E: airport<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This one is tough. The wordplay is a bit confusing: electrical connection vs. electrical wire. It's also important to keep the "house" in mind as the context. Which brings me to my solution.<n>The only relevant answer is "wall" (D). <n><n>The other options aren't plausible because:<n><n>-The telephone network and freeway have no significance in regards to whether there's an electrical connection in a house.<n><n>-The company (A) has no bearing on the issue at hand. Besides, the context of the question refers specifically to the home.<n><n>Finally: The only option that makes sense (other than the obvious "electrical connection" [A]) is "wall" (C).<n>And if you do happen to stumble upon an "electrical wire" (B) during your search, it's still plausible for the user to look at the wall as well.<n><n>The final answer is D: Wall<n><n>Input:What was the first thing he changed? Choices:  a: his name b: his address c: his telephone number d: his hair color e: his shoe size<n>Output : Reason:<n><n>To start, I know this question is about a man named George who changed his name to Jason to avoid being pursued by the police. I know this because the first sentence of the question tells me so: "Say you’re George, you know… George to the rescue…"<n>Now, the first question the user will ask is always the what. "What was the first thing?" This eliminates most irrelevant options (C, D, E).<n>The last part of the sentence ("...to avoid being pursued by police") indicates there's something relevant to pursuit in the story somewhere. This doesn't necessarily mean a crime was committed, but some form or pursuit must have occurred in order for the police to try to pursue George. This eliminates option B (his address).<n>Finally, I know his hair color and shoe size are irrelevant because nowhere within this passage do I read the term "hair" or "footwear."<n>The final answer, therefore, is A: his name<n><n>Input:She took the test and she failed to pass because she failed to score at least 70.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Jan went to the auditorium and listened to the speech. Where might he be? Choices:  A: crowd B: high school C: city D: somewhere E: theater<n>Output:		Reason:<n> <n>The first step is to identify which word or phrase can be replaced so that each of options make sense. In this case, the word "speech" could be replace by either "play" or "theater".<n><n>The next step is to identify where the replaced word most likely exists in the context of the sentence. Both "city" (C) and "theater" (E) seem reasonable, since both are proper nouns representing a specific, geographically defined location. The only way of determining which is more likely is to identify when and why "city" or "theater" would be used in the sentence.<n>However, "theater" (or "play") does not seem to be necessary here, because the sentence could still be correct without it: "Jan went to the auditarium and listened to __ the __." Furthermore, "somewhere" (B) is also not necessary. The sentence would still be grammatically correct if "somewhere" was removed: "Jan went to __ to listen".<n><n>Taking these considerations into account, "theater" is disqualified as an option, and "somewhere" is disqualified due to unnecessary wordiness. That leaves city vs. high school as possible substitutions.<n><n>To make a more definitive decision, one must analyze the context of the sentence in question, specifically the word "auditorium". Auditoriums are used only for plays, lectures, or similar events. That rules out all options except "high school" and "city."<n><n>The last criterium aids in deciding. "Jan ____ the auditorium"; "Jan ____; 'high school' doesn't make sense because then the sentence reads "Jan went to high school to listen to a speech" (which makes no sense), and "somewhere" would make it read "Jan went to somewhere and listened to a speech" (also not very informative).<n><n>Thus, the final option is "high school" (C): Jan went to the auditorum and listened to the speech."<n><n>Therefore, high school makes more sense as the context of the sentence and it is a location so Jan went to high school and listened to the speech would be correct for the option C.

Choices:  A: shelf B: cellar C: refrigerator D: cupboard E: grocery store<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To determine the answer to this question, you need to consider the context clues provided in the question. The word "I," indicated that the "I" person is speaking in the first person, or referencing things done directly by themselves. The mention of a canned food drive, and needing to pick up some contributions.<n><n>The next task to determine the answer to this is to eliminate any options that do not make sense given the context of the scenario. As the question makes clear, there are some items in the cellar (B) and other items in the grocery store (E). If the question is referring to a canned food drive at a business, then the grocery store does not make sense.<n><n>Options A and D do not make sense because they do not describe places where contributions would be stored, and the question does not refer to contributions as being in either location. Therefore, options C and E are the best answers.<n><n>So the answer is C: refrigerate and E: grocery<n><n>Input: I was going with some friends to see a movie, when they suggested what to do next? Choices:  C: go dancing B: walk around E: go back to the movie theater A: play tennis D: go swimming<n>Output: Reason<n><n>In order to find the answer to this question it's important to review the context clues that are given in the question. The most important clue is given in the question when the narrator mentions that the "they" person is going to see a movie with "some friends." This implies that the group, or at least some of the group, has been watching a movie.<n><n>In the options, we are given some possibilities of what to do after the movie. One possibility is to walk around (B), but we are told that the "they" has already done this, but wants to do something else.<n><n>Another option is to go back to the movie (A), but this does not make sense since it is inconsistent with the "they" person's desire to see a movie with friends. It would only makes sense for them to return if there was something wrong with the movie they were already sitting in. A better option to choose is option E.<n><n>Another possible option is to pick option C. This would seem plausible, but it is not consistent with the "they"'s desire

If the wheel was tight, then the driver would be aware that it was tight. Instead, it threatens to "fall off" (like an animal that has been loosened from its bindings).<n><n>Option E is not relevant, because "bind" has no relation at all to the wheel falling loose.<n><n>The only correct answer is E: bind.<n><n>Input: While we wait for the bus, we often read, walk, read and/or what?

If we were lying while waiting for the bus, we wouldn't be able to read.<n><n>Option B - makes more sense. If we are not walking or reading, then we must be doing something inactivity, like work.<n><n>Option C - is also unlikely.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The teams were evenly matched when competing against one another, what did spectators want to find out? Choices:  A: envy B: resentment C: winning or losing D: one winner E: two winners<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This is a tricky question because most of the options are plausible, which allows for a multitude of interpretations.<n>Eliminating irrelevant words/topics helps to focus in on the task at hand.<n><n>Option B (resentment) does not accurately describe what spectators are looking for in this scenario. It's unclear whether they are looking to resent a certain team or individual. Additionally, it is not uncommon for spectators to show admiration and appreciation for a team's skills.<n><n>Option E (two winners) is incorrect because the teams were evenly matched, which means they are likely to split the winnings, implying there will be one overall winner.<n><n>Option D (winning or losing) does not accurately capture the scenario either because spectators aren't necessarily looking to see who wins or loses, but rather how it happens and who wins.<n><n>That leaves option A (envy) and E (better understanding).<n>Of the two, option A (envy), is the only one that would fit the scenario.<n>So the final option would be A: envy<n><n>Input:Why did the woman feel disappointed she hadn't seen that episode (of her favorite program)? Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: Reason：<n><n>As with many contextual fill-in-the-blank questions, the answer lies not in the question itself, but in the preceding text. The relevant fact that gives away the correct answer is what comes before the question (in the first paragraph).<n><n>It's important to remember how the question is worded and to think outside the box when it comes to answering. For example, the answer "disappointed" (D) doesn't specifically reference a future state, nor does it make much sense in context. If she was disappointed, it's hard to imagine she wouldn't have known about it beforehand. The correct answer is actually "inform" (C), which implies she missed an episode she was expecting to see.

Where would he look? Choices:  A: fish market B: hawaiian waters C: gulf of mexico D: tropical sea E: south pacific ocean<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Option "E: south pacific ocean" is the best choice.<n><n>Johnny is already in the'south western' part of the Americas, so 'near America' would mean 'anywhere north of south America'. This rules out options 'a-d' because by definition 'fish market' and 'tropical sea' are in the Americas, just as 'beaches' (c), and 'gulf of mexico' (d) are. <n><n>Option 'b' means that he's looking for it in 'Hawaiian waters'.<n>That would be Hawaii, which is also in north America.<n><n>The same reasoning applies to option 'c', the gulf of mexico in North America, or option 'd', the tropical sea, which would be another form of the gulf, also in North America.<n><n>Option 'e' therefore, is the only one that makes sense. Johnny would look to sea in places south of America.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: south pacific<n>Input:In your first day of class, your classmate told you the story about his aunt, who is 4 years old. The student is a 15 year old boy.  What's that story? Choices:  None<n>Output: Reasonung:<n><n>There is no way to know, as the child is only 15 and they can't know what he thinks.<n><n>As the story is said to be 4 years old, but the student is 15, and the aunt is presumably an adult, the story is probably meant to suggest that the aunt is old, and the student is young. As such, it's likely that the story is fictitious.<n><n>Input:What is a story about a boy who falls down but won't get hurt? Choices:  none<n>Output: Reasioning:<n>The question is about the story.

Choices:  A: mobile phone B: wristwatch C: briefcase D: office E: desktop<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Tiny" in this context implies some sort of portability, not necessity. Therefore, this question should be answered in terms of a "calculator that can be carried around" rather than just "a calculator."<n><n>The word "calculator" implies a more advanced device, rather than something simple like a pencil and paper. Therefore, option A ("mobile phone") can be eliminated.<n><n>The remaining options mention a calculator that aims to be used in one place, not portable, and therefore none of these answers are relevant.<n><n>The most reasonable answer would be E: desktop computer. This is the earliest example of "a tiny calculator" that could be portable for usage, but could be kept at someone's desk if necessary.<n><n>Input:The young teenager, like every others, was playing on her iPhone, the new iPhone 5. Choices:  A. mobile phone B. wristwatch C. desktop computer D. laptop E. office<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The main task is to understand that the teenager isn't "like *every* other" in terms of her use of a mobile phone. Since she's playing on her iPhone and has likely bought one, we can reasonably assume a smart phone is in her hand.<n><n>Option A is the most logical choice for the teenager's phone - "a mobile phone" - and option B ("wrist watch") is an obvious answer that doesn't fit the given facts.<n><n>With this narrowed down, the next step is to reason out what the phone represents. Since the phone is new, we can infer that the teenage girl has access to one - which means it's a "pure" phone, not a smart watch or a desktop computer.<n><n>With this in mind, the only options left are D and E. But E ("office") makes no sense in this context, as offices are large and a phone is clearly carried around (or portable).<n><n>We are left with option D ("a laptop") which is the only remaining, most obvious choice.<n><n>So the answer would be D: laptop.<n>Input:The man who is waiting for the bus in the street wants to have a call to his parents, so he does this from the mobile phone.

Choices:  A: apartment B: pantry C: table D: living room E: shelf<n>Output:		Answer:<n><n>The question states that our candidate should be able to identify a place to store dishes, but not books. With this in mind, the first candidate answer stands out - apartment. This word contains the word "place" and fits the context of a storage location for dishes.<n><n>The next set of options - table and shelf - are unlikely candidates for the role of storage space for dishes. Table conveys the notion of a surface on which dishes can be placed, while shelf implies that dishes should be stored on a horizontal surface.<n><n>Finally option B is clearly incorrect, as we already identified apartment as the correct candidate for our role of storing dishes but not books. The word "pantry" does not convey this requirement.<n><n>The answer is apartment.<n><n>Input: If a word is at the end of a line, what letter does it start with?

The other set of options, from G to M, covers letters that are universally placed at the start of a word, such as I and A.<n><n>Therefore, the most logical choice is option G, as it covers all letters that are universally placement at the start of a line.<n><n>Input: In what county would you drive on Interstate 75? Choices: <n> A: Florida B: Tennessee C: Georgia D: North Carolina E: South Carolina<n><n>Output: Answer :<n><n>The first question to answer is to determine what information we are missing that prompted the question. It can be inferred that the person asking this question would be unfamiliar with this state since they are asking about the county. To know what part of the state they are unfamiliar with, we can go on to find out more information about the cities in each county by asking one more question about them if they were on this county's main road. <n><n>If we knew the interstate highway system existed in the south and also knew there was only one road in each county then we could identify it as a major highway.

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This is a classic question that can be applied in many scenarios: A parent is yelling at their child because the child has done something wrong, or that is misbehaving, or that is getting into some sort of chaotic or dangerous situation.The parent is trying to get the child to correct his/her actions, so the answer is: C: control children.<n><n>Another choice could have been D: care for children, but when someone is yelling as the parent is, it is to try to get the child to behave in a good way. This shows the parents are trying to control the child.<n><n>The other choices are outliers and can't possible be the answer.(B) understand children, (A) guide children, (D) care for children and (E) vent anger.

Choices:(A) Keep calm(B) Control themselves(C) Remember what you've said(D) Respond(E) Express emotions<n>Output:Reasoning:(A): When people are losing their temper, they always do something that shows anger or emotion. So C is not possible because people just "Remembers what you've said" at least once when they lose their calm, they can't remember their last words because they are usually wrong words.This question says people can have emotions but they can't control themselves, that's why it's B.

Choices:  A: city B: strip mall C: clerk D: neighborhood E: rooster<n>Output:		Which would you visit in a hospital? Choices: A: beauty salon B: school C: mall D: dentist E: restaurant<n><n>Output:<n><n>These questions are both categorization questions, where all of the options are classes in a category and the task is to pick the option that most closely matches (or fits into) the category as a whole. They are also sometimes called "situation questions" or "choice among categories."<n><n>The general strategy for category questions is to pick the option most likely to be found in the category as a whole, given the description.<n><n>The two questions above deal with classifications of stores and places. In the beauty salon question, the only option that has potential for a connection to a beauty salon is A. The others are not likely to be found in a beauty salon. Similarly, the hospital question asks us to classify stores/places likely to be found in hospitals. The question is fairly explicit about what each option could potentially be in the context of a hospital and the options are ranked in order of probability. <n><n>In each case, the answer that makes the best sense as what is most likely to be found with those labels for those places is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n>Output:		The only feeling a person might institute civil action is anger.<n><n>The first line of this problem reads: "What feeling might propel to instituting civil court?" This sentence refers to the word "propel," which here refers to actions prompted by a certain emotion. <n><n>The word "court" in this sentence is in connection with the word "propel" as one's emotions can result into the instituting of court action. Thus, the answer option "court action" (D) is ruled out.<n><n>"Anger" is the answer we're looking for. It is the only option that perfectly fits the context of civil action - that is, as a result of anger. Option "trial" (E) is related to anger but is irrelevant to the problem at hand. "Complications" (A) isn't as emotional as anger and is not a factor in instituting civil action.<n><n>The same reasoning applies to other options. "Tiredness" is not an adequate emotion to institute civil action, and "B " is inappropriate in this context. This makes "anger" (D) the only applicable answer.<n>So the final choice is A: anger<n><n>Input: Who is the man behind Dollar's dollar menu? Choices: 1. Aaron 2. Jeff 3. Seth 4. Steve 5. Matt<n>Output:The answer is Jeff.<n><n>The first time I was in McDonald's I saw that they were calling it dollar menu plus, which was just a way of saying a dollar menu, with more options than before. The reason why people call it that is because they don't think they can afford to buy lunch. At the beginning, it was just one dollar items.<n>So this clue tells us that Jeff is the one who is behind Dollar's Dollar Menu. <n><n>The second line states, "the only thing in common between the three of you was a shared name." The answer (4) Steve does not fit this clue, which states that only one is shared a commonality, not three. So 4 is out.<n><n>The final clue in the dialogue reads, "So you had an aunt who was the first one with the dollar menu?" The answer (A) does NOT fit this clue; no one else in the

Choices:  A: furniture store B: fishing camp C: hardware store D: sporting goods store E: engine<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The question can be answered in several ways. The word "where" implies that there are options for purchasing a fishing rod, so not all choices will be incorrect as an answer (e.g., "nowhere else"). The context of this question also suggests that the fishing rod is essential enough to merit frequent shopping at multiple locations.<n><n>Choice A ("furniture store") would certainly be an option if you were looking to buy a fishing rod, but it doesn't seem very reasonable under the present circumstances as stated in the question.<n><n>Choices B and C ("fishing camp" and "sporting goods store") are both plausible, but neither "sporting goods" nor fishing activities would be found exclusively in just one of the places (e.g., there is no rule that a certain type of sporting goods must be sold in a camp or vice versa).<n><n>The best answer is Choice D ("hardware store"), which is the one place you can buy a (pretty much) anything. A hardware store sells everything from sporting gear to furniture to fishing rods, to car engines.<n><n>Input:What did they bring me? Choices:  B: sushi C: pizza D: tacos E: a box<n>Output:Reasonning:<n>The second half of the question ("I said I wanted...") is vague, so we know that there probably wasn't a "they" who brought the subject anything. Also, all they were given was a box with something in it.<n><n>While the word "brought" does imply that it was one of two parties who delivered something to her - which could technically be "they" - we know the subject had a friend, and we also know that the friend has not returned. But we also know from what he said that the box was brought to him, so that means it would have had to come from someone else. So if it was the subject's friend, that'd be "we."<n><n>The word "box" is fairly vague in nature, and could mean nearly anything. However, the fact that a friend gave it to the subject, as well as the fact that it was not brought here (suggesting that it was delivered to her in the field) would eliminate things such as "pizza," which could not be found

Choices:  a: greek b: english c: hebrew d: dutch e: german <n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The book of Revelations is a book from the Bible. There are 66 books in the main collection of the Bible which is called the Canon. Revelations is a part of the New Testament, which is a collection of religious works from the early Christians from AD 80 to AD 200.<n>This passage from the Bible in Revelation 5:1:<n>"Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back,...sealed with seven seals."<n>In this passage we do not see any mention of greek, so greek is ruled out. To confirm this, we can visit any online dictionary. A search on Google for 'what language do the books of the Bible appear in?' yields the following results:<n>"The original books of the Hebrew Bible generally appeared in Hebrew or Aramaic. Only the New Testament was written in Greek. The original books of the Old Testament were translated from Hebrew to Greek between 250 and 200 BC, and were compiled to produce the Septuagint in Greek. These Greek versions became widely used in the Eastern church in both Greek-speaking and Armenian-speaking churches."<n>In one line, it says that the original books of the Bible were written either in Hebrew or Armentian.<n>In the previous answer, we already ruled out the book of revelations written in english. Therefore, we are left with hebrew (c), dutch (d) and german (e).<n>We have two additional clues about the question now: it's a language, so Hebrew and Armentian are not options and as it's in the book of Revelations, it falls into the New Testaments, however it does not fall into any of the categories mentioned above.<n>To confirm this choice (E) is the correct answer

If we go back to the wording - 'what sugary beverage' - here we can see the drink is'sugary', this hints to coffee hence the output:  E. coffee cup<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What divider stores papers for work or school? Choices:  A: street B: binder C: obesity D: living room E: office suite<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Choosing option D, “office suite” as the answer to “What divider stores papers” for work or school, the analyst should have reasoned along the lines of the following: What dividers store papers on the computer screen?”. Then by eliminations from the options left, the answer becomes “office suite” because it has ‘office’ and it’s the divider where ‘papers for work or school ’stores.<n><n>Input:Which is not a fruit of a type of nut? Choices: 	A: coconut B: acorn C: walnut D: pistachio E: hickory<n>Output: reasoning:<n><n>Choosing option C, “walnut” as the answer to "Which is not a type of fruit?", the analyst should have had the following sequence in his or her reasoning process: What are the types of fruits?<n><n>Choosing any of the other options except C will lead to a wrong answer because all the other options are indeed types of fruit. And after eliminations, only “walnut” will not be left as an option.<n>Input:A 6 letter word was spoken and then broken into groups of 2 letters. Then the group of letters was unbroken and then it was spoken. Which of the following is the group of two letters? Choices; A: rt B: or C: ur D: oe E: nt<n>Output: Reason<n>We can solve this question by using a two-step method. First, list possible solutions and then eliminate the wrong ones.<n>Step 1: To start with, we need to list out all the possible 2-letter combinations based on the given parameters that “The 6 letter word was broken into groups of 1 or 2”.<n><n>Step 2: Now we have a list of all possible 2-letter groups. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the context of the question by narrowing down what the word could be (since there are an infinite number possibilities).<n><n>Answer: NT<n><n>Input:You drive from point A to point B. Then you arrive at point D and walk to point E and return to point F. You are finished. Where is point C? Choices:  (a) in a hospital (b) at your home (c) you haven't told us (d) lost (

A person who is outgoing is likely seeking to have adventures/experiences, not own a house (B), to look good (E), or to appear playful (C).<n><n>Notice that none of the options are seeking to appear good or looking for own house.<n><n>Option "new experiences" (A), while a little ambiguous on the exact kind of new experiences the individual is seeking, is the only one that fits into this category.<n><n>So the final answer should be A: new experiences<n><n>Input: What question should John ask? Choices:  I: Is there anyone in your life you can trust?   II: How many people have been in your life over the years?  III: Are you in love?   IV: How do you feel about being alone?   V: Are there any problems between us?   VI:  Do you have any problems that you would like to share with John?  <n>Output: Reason/Analysis:<n>This is a confusing set of choices.<n>However, from the context of the passage it is apparent that John’s girlfriend has told him she no longer is in love with him. John seems to be genuinely concerned about his relationship and wants to know if it can be saved.<n>Let’s examine each choice to see if any of them are relevant.<n>Choice I is a non sequitur, as it’s irrelevant that he can trust anyone in his life if he and his gf are no longer interested in being together.<n>Choice II is not a problem to look into unless John truly intends to explore his ex’s dating preferences which, in context would be inappropriate and unnecessary.<n>Choice III also is not relevant as we’re searching for a question, not an observation. Choice IV, however, does seem to hint at something to ask John’s girlfriend, and is reasonable in context—even if she doesn't like being alone, she isn’t going to go through life with John, so to a degree they’re in the same boat. Finally, Choice V is potentially relevant, but can be answered equally as readily with a simple “yes” without probing further.<n>So it gets down to Choice VI, a yes-no question asking if John’s girlfriend would be am

Choices:  A: country B: trouble C: city D: sun E: control<n>Output:		Reasoning:This refers to government in the sense of government as an entity, rather than as a government as a set of policies.<n><n>Government's primary function is to govern the people, which means making decisions that are in their best interests.<n>An individual can have personal interests that are opposed to the interests of the government, and the government can also have the interests of its people which are not in the best interests of the individual, but not vice versa.<n><n>A government's people can have personal interests that conflict with the government's interest. If the government has the support of the people, the government can also have interests that are not in the interests of the people, but they are in their interests.<n><n>Therefore, the best choice is B, trouble.

Choices: A: be able to move around. B: be able to talk. C: be able to work without an employer. D: be able to learn what they wanted. E: be able to stay in the same place.<n>Output:Reason:The "Independence" and "Founding Father" referred to the United States of America, founded in 1776. The "Nation" is the United States and it's "Founded in 1771", which is 166 years before 1776, and it's "Founders" were "1776-Founders of the United States of America. To be "Founders", they have to be famous in the United States.<n><n>In 1776 the United States gained its independence from Britain. One of the key reasons for gaining independence was that the British allowed only citizens of England to vote, meaning that the citizens of the other 12 states were not permitted to vote and thus did not have representation in parliament.<n><n>The Founding Fathers of the United States of American found it important to ensure that citizens of other states were treated equally as citizens of England as well as citizens of the British Empire.<n><n>Therefore A,C, and D are incorrect, because the citizens of the 12 states were able to move around, could talk, could work, and could learn what they wanted

Choices:  A: countryside B: united states C: beach D: atlas E: developed land<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option (A) states that these people took the scenic route because they wanted "to cut through the countryside".<n>This choice of wording makes no sense in the context of this problem statement. For example, it's unlikely that a driver would drive 100 miles out of their way just to cut through a small patch of countryside along the way.<n><n>Answer (C) states that the people chose to take the scenic tour because they wanted "to take the tour that cuts through the beach".<n>This is also a poor choice of wording, as it's unlikely that someone would take the scenic route just to take a tour. The scenic route may be intended to take some time, but it wouldn't be considered to be "taking a tour" in the traditional sense of the term - meaning it would not be a planned out travel experience.<n><n>Answer (D) states that the people choses to take the scenic drive because they wanted "to be able to drive through the atlas".<n>This is also poorly worded, as the "atlas" mentioned here is just a reference to an actual world map with geographical features - it isn't really "driving through" anything.<n><n>Option (B) states that "they chose the highway that cuts through the U.S.".<n>This answer is correct, as it implies that they chose this route to "cut through" the united states, which is what they wanted to do.<n><n>Option (E) states that they chose to take the scenery tour because they wanted to "cut through the developed nations land".<n>This is another example of poor wording. The concept of "cutting through" a nation might seem like it would make sense, but in reality it doesn't. Nations are made up of people, not land - so it doesn't actually make sense for someone to say they "cut through" a geographical or national region.<n><n>So the final answer has to be B: they chose the highway that cutted through the U.S.<n><n>Input:What was the reason the tour guide had to cancel the tours because of a fire?

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:They took a break from all the rides to have lunch, while eating hamburger they talked about how they were going to what on the next ride? Choices:  A: heartburn B: have fun C: enjoy D: gas E: food poisoning<n>Output:		Reason: The answer is 'E – gas'<n><n>Given choice A, "heartburn". It is plausible that the riders were going to experience heartburn, but they were talking specifically about eating or having food poisoning. So this answer will be eliminated. <n>Next, there are no reasons to choose 'A' or 'B' as the riders would have most likely not to eat hamburgers. They are probably going to enjoy eating at some of themesed restaurants at the Disney theme parks instead. Additionally, they already did eat, so they would definitely not be going to eat again.<n><n>It is also probable that they would not have asked for B as well because they already were experiencing fun at the theme parks. Choice C (to enjoy) is plausible and should be considered. However, this does not clearly state the outcome of when they would have gone through a ride. We can see that the riders are probably going to enjoy the future activities, but this doesn't tell us whether they are currently enjoying. So the answer choice should be C.<n><n>Lastly, we are left with two options, C and D. One would reasonably assume that D wouldn't hold much truth either. We can only assume that they were going to have fun. They have to be going through the rides because they wanted 'fun' and the rides at Disney were meant to be fun experiences. We can't say that the rides would have given them food poisoning; again, they could have very well said "I feel a bit sick after that ride." But as the sentence reads, we can assume that they discussed about food poisoning. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'E - gas'

Choices:  B: with others C: at home D: in the library E: under the sun<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Reading news on one's phone is only possible if there is network coverage, and a phone has sufficient reception. The question never mentions coverage or reception, so option C: "at home" remains the most accurate response.<n><n>As mentioned, the question involves reading news, and the only possible way to do so is with a cell phone. The context would be unclear if some other type of device like a laptop was referred to. Accordingly, option B: "with others" is out.<n><n>Input: Which of the following words is not a color?

It seems more likely that she meant it as an edible treat than anything else.<n>So here choices was B: junk food <n><n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would there be a connection to go to another place? Choices:  A: wires B: electrical circuit C: computer network D: wall E: freeway<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>Option A is ruled out as it does not make sense. Connections may occur in one of many places: in a computer, in the middle of the street, or in an individual’s brain.<n><n>Option B is ruled for the same reason. <n><n>Option C can be eliminated because there is no need to connect to someone’s brain. <n><n>Option D doesn’t need to be eliminated because it can be a reasonable answer. There is no need for a place in a freeway to be connected somewhere else, as they would simply provide a physical reference point to the overall structure of freeways.<n><n>Option E is eliminated as it does not make any logical statement.<n><n>The only option is thus D: wall.<n><n>Input: At school, when does time begin? Choices: A: 8:00 AM B: 8:05 AM C: 8:15 AM D: 3:15 PM E: 9:00 PM<n>Output: Reasoner<n><n>Explanation"<n><n>Option A isn't a good choice because this kind of time is "09:15." <n><n>For option B, the time is also a very long time, which means that "8:10" is the appropriate answer. This is not what we need, which is 8:05, or even 15 minutes earlier than 8:00.<n><n>Option C is not good because there isn't any period in the question.<n><n>Option D is not good because the question does not refer to any specific time. It's just a time around school.<n><n>The only correct answer is thus B: 8:10. <n><n>Input: What does it matter if no is not a word in your dictionary? Choices: A. Because every person will have their own dictionary B. Because even if no isn't in mine it doesn't mean it's wrong C. Because the words in dictionary are set by people and not dictionarians D. Because no is a valid word in dictionaries E. Because many dictionaries use very precise and technical definitions that don't always make sense<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Explanation<n><n>Option A: This is true. Since dictionaries are set by people and will include words that everyone recognizes

Choices:  A: living room B: animal shelter C: georgia D: pet shop E: dog show<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n>The first step is to identify key words that give potential clues as to the correct option.<n>Option B: "animal shelter" tells us that the answer could be "get a stray small dog from an animal shelter."<n>Option C: "pet shop" suggests that the answer could be a "stray small dog from a pet shop."<n><n>The next step is to identify the main topic, which is "stray small dog". From there, we can see that the location where the dog may be located is the next significant detail. <n><n>Option "dog show" (E), while plausible, wouldn't make logical sense as a location where you could "get a stray dog." It's an unusual location where people don't typically pick up a stray dog.<n><n>The remaining options are all viable choices. Ultimately the decision comes down to the main topic, which in this case is "stray small dogs".<n><n>Input:Choose one of the following. 15,370 Choices:  A - 16,190, b - 16895 C - 16470 d - 16695 e - 19,620<n>Output: <n>Input:The length of the following road is how many miles?

Choices:  A: pharmacy B: person C: drugstore D: bedroom E: mcdonalds<n>Output:		Reason for Elimination:<n>Option A: the choice is wrong; contraception is not a "device".<n>Option B: the choice is wrong because a prescription is a requirement for drug purchase.<n>Option C: the choice is wrong, because a contraceptive can be both a medical and non-medical device.<n>Option D: the choice is wrong since contraceptions are not consumed in an eatery.<n>Option E: the choice is wrong as contraceptives are medical devices that require a prescription or medical intervention.<n>The answer must mention a medical facility where they can purchase a contraceptive without a prescription. Therefore, that eliminates option B (drugstore) as well as option E (fast food restaurant)<n><n>Option C: a contraceptive device may be both considered as medical devices and non-medical devices. Option C is thus eliminated.<n><n>Option A: pharmacy is a medical facility but it does not sell medical devices. Options B and C can both be ruled out.<n><n>Option D: option D is the correct answer. It's a valid answer since contraceptives are considered medical devices and don't need prescriptions. However, since a pharmacy is medical facility which sells medical devices, option A isn't the answer because it does not mention a pharmacy. And option D is also the best answer in terms of grammar.<n><n>

Choices:  A: football stadium B: surface of earth C: car show D: opera E: movie<n>Output:		Why: <n><n>The first task in solving this question is to understand the context in which a person might be "looking at some things which can not move". The context involves something moving, but not doing so. This implies that the person could be looking at cars moving on a race track. <n><n>Option "surface of the earth" (C) is incorrect, as cars cannot move on the surface of the earth. Option "football stadium" (A) is incorrect as things in the football stadium could not possibly move because there is nothing for them to move to. <n><n>So, the "car show" (D) is incorrect, as well since not everything that moves in a car show is physically moving on a racetrack (such as those that are merely displayed). Option "movie" (E) is plausible because it is possible to view something, such as actors, on a screen, but not really move, in the same way that a car is not physically moving on a race track at a car show, but can still be observed.

Choices:  A: amusement park B: urban area C: airport D: shopping malls E: train station<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>First off, notice the context of the question - we're at a shopping mall, where there are parking lots and other facilities for shoppers and patrons. <n><n>Then, look at the question choices. There are options such as "shopping malls" (C) and "airport" (D), which might seem like plausible answers at first glance. However, these aren't specific enough to be correct. For example, "shopping mall" technically covers a wide variety of places. In addition, "shopping bags" wouldn't be an appropriate accessory in an airport.<n><n>All the remaining options ("amusement park" (A), "urban area" (B), and "train station" (E)) make sense in the context of a shopping mall or shopping parking lot. While each answer could be reasonably given for the right reasons, the correct answer is (C): airport, because the shopping bags are probably being carried to bring back objects purchased at the mall.<n>So the final correct answer is C: airport<n><n>Input: Which of the following is an example of a noun? Choices: <n>A: a book, a car, a table, a box<n>B: candy, gum, apples, pears<n>C: mango, pineapple, papaya, mango<n>D: chocolate, marshmallow, gumdrop, chocolate<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>First of all, we need to know what a noun is. Nouns refer to inanimate objects - things that don't move or do more than the usual function for their kind. Nouns generally do not express quantity.<n><n>The question choices represent various quantities of inanimate objects. <n><n>"Book, a car" (A) is a phrase in the English language, but it doesn't convey any of the characteristics of a noun, so it isn't correct.<n><n>"Candy, gum, and apple" (B) are all nouns that refer to various fruits, but since the fruits cannot be counted or compared, it isn't correct<n><n>"Apples, pears, and mangoes" (C) are all words that denote multiple fruits.

It was overkill.  What did he shoot at? Choices:  A: body armor B: ungulate C: bomber D: kill people E: animal<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question "What did he shoot at" can be broken down into a question "Who or What was James shooting". But "Who was James shot at" could be an answer for question "What did he shot"; so it could also be interpreted as "Who or What was being shooter".<n><n>Here, choices of A and C do not fit the scenario. Choices of A and B do not fit the scenario but they could fit in a different context. Similarly, Choices of B and D do not fit the scenario, but they could fit in different context. Therefore, the least likely choice should be picked out from the remaining ones. "Body armor"(B) is the least likely to answer the question. The remaining choices do not fully fit the scenario nor are they likely answer. <n><n>The question is "What James shot at" not "Who or What was shooter". James is the only shooter in the situation, and was shooting at an animal (E). So the final answer is E<n><n>Input:The wolf, who was dressed in goat skin, approached the sheep.

E: "I do not know."<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>A) "Here I am."(E) is the most likely answer for the question. Dog is the leader of the dog. So the wolf is asking where the dog is when he appears in front of sheep.<n><n>B) "We have none."(C) is the least likely answer for the question since dog is the leader of the dogs, and if Dog is not in sheep, then what is he doing? So the answer is E<n><n>C) "My master does not Know." (A) is plausable since if dog is not in sheep then He must be somewhere else.<n><n>D) "I am your superior" (A) is least plausable. If dog (D) is Dog, then he is the leader of the Dog. Otherwise he is just a dog and not the leader of a Dog.<n><n>E) "I do not know" (B) is the most plausable answer for the question.

But a closer look at the options reveals that it is not printers.  If this is an industry then it has to be something that is widely used and Makerbot does that very well for this industry. But Makerbot manufactures 3DF printers. This eliminates option A. <n>I don't think camera or goggles would be considered as an industry. Also goggles are just a part of an industry and not a whole industry. This eliminates options B, C and D. But industry does not mean hardware and software combined.

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What creatures performing pollination are loved my millions? Choices:  A: birds B: action C: butterflies D: happiness E: anxiety<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>All options begin with an indefinite article "a/an." (Option A, B and D). So the question is either about "one" of those items or they don't want you to pick "a" butterfly, "a" bird or "a" happiness. <n><n>Now, this question is asking you to explain a fact about animals. That means you should only consider animals.<n><n>However, none of the options are explicitly for animals. One is for pollination (B and D) which occurs to plants rather than animals. Other is about love (E), which is an abstract concept and the question explicitly states that it's about creatures. <n><n>So it's safe to ignore the "action" (C) and the "happiness" (E), because they aren't relevant to the answer.<n><n>Since the question is about creatures, there's only one option that fits this context - that is option "b". <n><n>The next task to tackle is whether the choice is singular or plural. The answer must be singular since the question uses "one animal", so you should only choose the single possible option from a list. <n><n>So the final answer here is "B: one action"<n><n>Input:What do the people of the country want to see and hear?Choices:  A: a president B: a newspaper C: news media D: a tv station E: radio<n>Output: Reason for Answer: <n><n>This question is looking for an abstract noun that describes people's interests. The purpose of analysis is to understand people's interests. <n><n>So to narrow down the options, we can try eliminate redundant options:<n><n>1. Option A ("a president") is redundant because it is already an abstract noun.<n><n>2. Option B ("a newspaper"), D and E ("a television studio"), C and E ("radio media") are also reduced, as they are also abstract nouns.<n><n>3. Only option "B" and D" are the only abstract nouns left in the options.<n><n>So the choice is only between "newspapers" and "television stations." <n><n>We must consider one more thing: the correct answer must be singular, as the question mentions "the people."<n><n>4. So finally we arrive at the correct answer "

Choices:  A: order B: queueing up C: wait turn D: fatigue E: anger<n>Output:		Reason: The keyword `waitturn` could be interpreted as a line forming to either buy something or get a vaccine.<n>```<n>The keywords `ordering`(A) and `queueing`(C) are both common phrases when you are buying something. Those words aren't what a person in a line might be feeling though.<n><n>The keyword `waiting` or `waiting turn` could be interpreted as words a person in a line would use if they were talking about their frustration over getting a vaccine or waiting at the DMV. In that context, option E is the correct answer.<n>```<n><n>Input: The new employee was having an especially hard time understanding anything and had a knack for making the biggest mistakes. What best describes the new employee's situation? Choices: A: frustation B: anxiety C: incompetence D: nervousness E: none of the above<n>Output: Reason : The word 'fustation' here could be interpreted as referring to a new employee who may have been feeling overwhelmed or frustrated in the workplace.<n>```<n>The word `frustration`(A) is not inaccurate, but the context suggests that this new employee may actually be performing poorly and is struggling to find any success in their work.<n><n>Alternatives such as `anxiety`(B) and `nervousness`(D) are too extreme, given that we don't know whether the new employee is generally nervous or anxious about their job.<n><n>The correct answer should be `C: incompetence` - it covers the context and expresses the idea that the new employee is having trouble performing well in their job.<n><n>Input: What are a company's competitive advantages? Choices: A. The customer who purchases from that company will be very satisfied. B. It has the highest salary in the industry for it's employee's. C.

Choices:  A: fingernails B: garden C: corner D: computer E: closet<n>Output:		 Reason:Dirt is not a good thing to have in your home. However, by the context you are asking "where can I put it"?<n>As a human being you have fingernails and a computer that are a bit dirty. The garden would be good place.<n>The closet is not good enough to put it. As the option was very general, fingernail and the garden had the same answer.<n><n>Input;The lab results had been compiled the scientist began analyzing the data because he was looking for what Choices:  A : the answer B : to learn more about the answer to learn more about the thing C: the answer D: an answer  E : a more complete answer<n>Output: If the scientists were looking for the answer the question is: "How did you find the answer".<n>Reasoning: You know, scientists can search all over the world wide web for an answer. However the context of the question is "The lab results had been collected the scientist began analyzed the data" not "the scientist wanted the answer as a result".<n>So the correct answer is D: an answer.<n><n># Input:An average family had three members.

Choices:  A: station B: every car and house C: shop D: bedroom E: space shuttle<n>Output:		Reason A is wrong because the question does not ask about one radio. The remaining choices are related to shopping for one radio: station B is not a store, but a place where one can buy a radio. So stations B and C (which are different shops) can be discounted. The remaining choices are incorrect (shops usually carry many radios). E is not correct because no radio was mentioned, and we cannot possibly state that a radio is in the space shuttle. This leaves us with D: a shop. This choice is not explicitly stated, but the context indicates this as the proper answer.<n><n>Input: What is 15 divided by the sum of its digits? Choices: 1) 7 2) 4 3) 9 4) 2 5) 3<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>In this question, "divided" is a mathematical term, and the question asks for division -- not the more commonly used form of that mathematical phrase, multiplication.<n>Therefore, the sum is what the sum is for each digit, which is simply a number -- not the whole number itself. For example, the sum of the digits of 15 is the number 1+5 = 6.<n>Therefore, 15 divided by its sum is 15/6 or 2.

Choices:  A: get to know B: gain knowledge C: intelligence D: education E: gaining knowledge<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>This question is asking for the reason a certain action leads to the desired outcome. This can be answered by selecting the option that specifically describes why a person seeks knowledge. For example, A would be eliminated because it doesn't offer the reason why someone seeks knowledge.<n><n>C could also be eliminated since it doesn't differentiate between knowledge and intelligence. Likewise, E could be eliminated as well because gaining knowledge includes an intention to learn - but gaining knowledge may not lead to learning.<n><n>The remaining answer options are B and D, which are both viable, although B is a bit too broad. The final answer would be D.<n><n>So the final answer would be D:  intelligence<n><n>Input:Which one does not belong to the other answer?<n><n>A:  cat<n>B:  house<n>C:  fish<n>D:  cat person<n>Output: Reasonnign:<n>This question requires a deductive reasoning process to eliminate the incorrect answer from the available options. For this type of question, it is helpful to remember that each set of options needs to be mutually exclusive. <n><n>This is because the question is posing four options and asks which one does not belong, so the options need to all be unique and unrelated in meaning. Since the options are nouns, and the wrong one may mean any of these four words, we cannot immediately assume that one of the <n><n>answers does not belong.<n><n>To begin, it is helpful to eliminate one of the options to ensure that it is the wrong answer. <n><n>Option C, "fish," would be eliminated because "fish" is a noun and therefore cannot be a person, so it would only go with one of the options.<n><n>Now two of the options are left and neither of them is an exact synonym. <n><n>Option A and option D are not synonyms because "cat" is a person and "cat person" is a noun. This means that these two options cannot go together. <n><n>Finally, option B is "house," which a lot of people would assume is not unique. While "house" could certainly refer to a place where someone lives, it also has other meanings, so could someone find another use for a synonymous term?<n><n>This would suggest option B is the correct option, although it is still not exactly syn

Choices:  A: actions B: legal C: authentic D: logical E: legitimate<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A is excluded, as it is more about a "certificate of action" which is about a course of action, than about its quality. So eliminate this option. <n><n>The remaining options are related to "certificate of authenticity." However, "authentic" is not quite the right term for this context. Since these are fake designer bags, they would not be real designer bags, therefore they wouldn't have a real authentic certificate. An illegitimate item cannot be legitimate in the first place, hence eliminating option C.<n><n>With the two remaining options, E is by far the strongest as it captures the purpose of the certificate. Option D is too specific, and should be excluded. The purpose of the certificate is to verify the legitimacy of the bag, not to verify the logical soundness of the design or anything else similarly technical. Therefore the final answer is E.<n><n>

Choices:  A: race track B: kentucky derby C: american southwest D: triple crown E: horse derby<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, option A, which is the race track is an incorrect answer as the question mentions the crowds being big at the sport itself, the horse derby does not describe a gathering of people around a horse. Option C can be eliminated because it does not make sense that the crowds would be at the american southwest. Option D is incorrect because the three races which make up the triple crown is the derby, so it would make sense that the biggest crowds would be gathering at the derby. Option B, the kentucky derby is a specific event in the triple crown, so the option can be dropped. <n><n>Only three options remain: Option A, the horse derby, Option C, the american southwest and Option E, the triple crown. The american southwest is a geographic location and so the question does not seem to pertain to horses, so it is a useless answer. The Horse derby, which is a race, would fit the question the best. Option E does not specify the region/place where the horses are racing which leaves us with two answers: Triple crown which is a series of three races or the horse derby which is a specific event in that series. <n><n>The horse derby is the best answer for this question.<n><n>Input:"How to train your dragon" which movie which would be your favorite if you haven't already seen the movie the viking village?

Choices:  A: move away from B: laying in C: sweating D: movement E: walking out of<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>What this question is essentially trying to gauge is how a person would end up stopping standing in a puddle. The options all have to do with what happens after a person has stopped standing in the puddle. However, some choices are rather implausible - such as "lying in" (C) or "walking out of" (E). The latter is a long-term solution; in the same way, lying in a puddled does not make logical sense.<n><n>The other options, such as "sweating" (D) or "movement" (B) are more realistic. But they are also vague. "sweating" suggests a person would sweat because they stopped standing in the pond, without specifying the source of the sweat or the amount of sweat. "Movement" (B) is vague in what precisely needs to move: a person's feet, their body, the rest of their body, etc?<n><n>The correct answer is "Movement"(B) because it's the one that is the most accurate. It's clear that the outcome desired is movement, which is the body's reaction following the stoppage of standing in a pudle.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is one use of the word "profit"? Choices:  A:"Loss" B:"Rebellion" C:"Lack of money" D:"Gain" E:"Success"<n>Output: Reason:<n>The word "profit" means to have an advantage or benefit when used in the English language. This can be seen in its Greek origin, profitas, which means "advantages".<n><n>However, "lack of money" (C) does not mean to have an advantage or benefits. This is why this option cannot be considered the correct use of "profit". Nor can "loss" (A), "rebellion" (B), and "success" (E).<n><n>The only logical options are "gain" (D) and "advantage".<n><n>Input: In what month during the year was the event described in the following excerpt from a poem?

Choices:  A: drink tea B: thank god C: open eyes D: feel angry E: complete sentence<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Analyze the options first to see which one fits the context.<n>"Just woke up" implies that one is awake after sleeping, so they would need to open their eyes.<n>So the options "wake up", "drink tea", "feel angry", and "open eyes" are irrelevant, as they do not fit the context.<n><n>The remaining options are "complete sentence" and "thank god".<n><n>"Complete" sounds like completion of a task, so the correct one is "complete sentence".<n><n>Finally, what does "thank god" suggest?<n>It implies that the person has found him or herself in a good situation that they were thankful for, so this is the correct option.<n><n><n>---<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.<n>Input: What does it mean if somebody says that he doesn't need any sugar? Choices: A: He is in his late 20s. B: He wants to live more eco-friendly. C: He knows how to make something sweet. D: He is being greedy. E: He wants to become a good speaker.<n>Output: Reasoni:<n><n>"Doesn't need any sugar" implies that he does want sugar, so options "he is in his late 30s" and "he wants to live more ecological" are irrelevant.<n><n>Furthermore, option "he knows how to make something" is irrelevant because its phrase is not used with other options.<n><n>The remaining three options are "he is not being greedy", "he wants to become a good man", and "he is being greedy".<n><n>"Not being greedy" does not make sense in the given context, as "sugar" would usually mean money. So "he is not being grumpy" is ruled out.<n><n>Next, "he wants to become an eco-friendly man" is plausible since sugar can have unwanted environmental and ecological impacts.<n><n>"He is being greedy" also makes sense. One cannot help but be a "good speaker" in an attempt to obtain money or power by any means (i.e., being a greedy person), so this is the most appropriate answer.<n><n>So the final answer for this question is E: He wants to have more
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What are people playing when they want to take the lead with small papers? Choices:  A: very heavy B: video game C: news article D: card game E: lead pencil<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Let's first consider the options that don't fit the context or meaning of the question. For instance, the option "video games" (B) are likely unrelated to the context of "taking the lead". The options "news article" (C), "card game" (D), and "lead pencil" (E) don't quite capture the sense of smallness and lightness that the question expects.<n><n>That leaves us with the option that states "small papers". This appears to be the correct answer because both the context and meaning of the question suggest that playing with small papers would be an appropriate response.

Choices:  A: squid B: pencil C: newspaper D: fountain pen E: printer<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "squid" (A) is incorrect because inking is generally done with a pen instead of a squid. Also, what does it mean to "fill with ink"?<n><n>Option "newspaper" (B) is an example that's too literal. A newspaper might be filled with ink, but that does not mean it is used for printing.<n><n>Option "fountain pen" (C), "pencil" (D), and "printer" (E) are incorrect because they don't convey the correct result. None of them say what the printer needs to be filled with in order to print. Instead, "ink" should be put in the printer.<n>So the final output answer is E: printer<n><n>Input: Why am I seeing your picture everywhere I go? Choices:  a: because your eyes are everywhere b: you are everywhere. c: all eyes are on you. d: because you are the best. e: because your friends are everywhere <n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Option "all eyes are on you" (A) would be correct to reply if the person were seeing someone's picture everywhere - perhaps on t-shirts, posters, in magazines, etc.<n><n>Option "you are everywhere" (B) would be correct if the person were seeing the same person in different locations. Or, if the person in seeing many pictures of them, perhaps on billboards.<n><n>Option "Because you are the best" (D) doesn't fit the context of the question, in which the person does not look up to them.<n><n>Option "You're the best" (C) is correct if the person were talking to a friend or sibling. But if the person sees them in photos everywhere, it would be unlikely to refer to their friend that way.<n><n>Option "your friends are everywhere" (E) is incorrect if the person were describing seeing a photo of the same person in different places.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is B: you are everywhere<n><n>Input: When is a good time to take a shower?<n>Choice: A: morning B: night<n>Choice: C: Before going to bed.<n>Choice: D: Anytime.<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Option "before going to bed" (C) is clearly the best option in this scenario.

Choices:  A: each state B: gettysburg address C: state of union D: each country E: europe<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to identify the term with which the question is referencing. The answer can only be one of two options: "state of union," from which the "of union" portion can be deducted, or "each country."<n><n>Next, the question refers to a "capital" (A), but it's unclear whether the question is referring to individual capital cities or capital in a broader sense. The word "capital" is more commonly used to refer to the country or government, such as "the capital of the United States" or "capital of France."<n><n>If "the state of union" is referring to the speech itself, then the first option is incorrect. That eliminates the "state of union" from contention.<n><n>If it's referring to the speech that takes place in the capital, then the last option is incorrect, because it does not take place in a capital city. The "union" refers to a country, not a speech. Now only four options remain: each state, each country, state of union, and each country. But that narrows down by removing each state, state of union, which refers to a speech. So the answer is each country.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions with the right choice.<n><n>Input: What letter on the keyboard do you type to copy text?

On the contrary, it is being used to denote the letter C (that is, the 'C' key on the keyboard), which is the first letter of the alphabet, and used on the keyboard to type the letter C. The only answer choice that meets this condition is a. We can thus eliminate the other options, which are: b: 'v', c: 'x', d: 'z', and e: '2'.<n><n>Input: What does a 180 mile an hour train sound like?

Input:A: We're no longer protected by it.<n>B: The body's immune system breaks down and we die.<n>C: It can't function well anymore.<n>D: We don't have to worry about it any longer.<n><n>Output:<n><n>In this case, if something goes wrong with your body's immune, it is going to allow the infection to run wild and you will succumb. Immune system is how we protect ourselves. It is the natural immune system and all natural things are not 100% good and that is what we should expect with our natural body immune system. Yes body's immune can break down so if something goes wrong with it we as a body will succumb.

All the atoms that comprise everything are estimated to be that many atoms. <n><n>1 atom per each electron and each proton. 1 electron and one proton. Atomic particles have mass energy. The universe is a large system and the universe is made up of mass. Mass can be turned into energy. So all the energy in the universe is a very large amount and that would include all the energy.

Choices:  A: fun B: talent C: learn about D: intelligence E: recognize<n>Output:		Solution:<n><n>The word "knack" in the sentence suggests a talent or skilled ability. That immediately eliminates options "fun" (A) and "learn about" (B).<n>Additionally, the word "entertaining" in the sentence indicates the focus is on performing or putting on a show. Thus, options "intelligence" (D) and "recognize" (E), which refer to qualities like being intelligent or being able to recognize something, are unnecessary.<n><n>The last task is to narrow down exactly what kind of talent the woman has; she possesses skills that make her a "natural" at performing or providing entertainment.<n><n>Option "talent" (C) fits that description, so it is the best choice. The sentence would read like this: She had a natural talent for entertaining her audience.<n>So, the final answer is C: talent <n><n>Input:She got the message she'd seen that people were talking about how they could see for miles on the clear day.So she just took a deep breath because what? Choices: B: It was going to snow A: The sky in a different color D: People were upset E: They had seen the clouds<n>Output: Solution: <n><n>The word "just" in the sentence indicates a recent or instantaneous action. That immediately leads us to eliminate option "A: It was going to rain (B). "A little less talking" in the lyrics is a recurring phrase throughout the song, so option "B" (A) does not fit here, as it would mean that the lyrics are referring to something that isn't occurring in the storyline.<n><n>We can eliminate option "D" because while people seeing clouds might be described as something that's been "seen in a different color" (D), it doesn't necessarily mean they're taking a deep breath.<n><n>Because she can see for miles on the "clear day" (C), then option "C" could be the case.<n>Input: The police were investigating the case and they had never saw something like that.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Dave put his beer where he could get to it, but it would be off the floor.  Where did he put it? Choices:  A: refrigerator B: closet C: can D: shelf E: soccer game<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this scenario, the floor does constitute off the floor, because floors are, literally, "off the floor." "Off the floor" in this case is a modifier for "floor," which indicates it is next to the floor. With that context clued into place, it should be evident that the options with floor are not valid responses. <n><n>Similarly, option B, "closet," could plausibly be read to mean "in the closet," but because that description doesn't match what the sentence states, that would indicate closet did not refer to the closet.<n><n>Now the remaining options are valid based solely on their meanings, such as "cabinet" (D) - it's a piece of furniture found on the ground.<n><n>If the correct answer was "soccer game," the sentence would read "Dave put his beers where he could get to them, but it would be at the soccer game." There is no context cluing that "soccer game" refers to where the beer is put. There's another way that could happen, especially if option D were "garage." "At the soccer game" and "at the garage" would then have to be taken as metaphorical placements for the beers. So, if "At the soccer field" could have validly been "At the football field of dreams," then "soccer game" could potentially indicate that the beer could have gone anywhere. <n><n>This scenario also highlights how important the structure of a question is, because it is often how we decide to interpret an answer. Without that, it could just as likely read "A: at the floor B: in the closet C: at the can" and we wouldn't know that "off the floor" refers to the "floor" being put onto something next to it, instead of that it refers to the actual floor-level surface.<n><n>If the question were written, "Dave put his drinks near the floor, but it was on the ground. Where did he put them?" this would be a different matter: the meaning conveyed by the structure is clear that "floor" would refer to an above-ground surface.<n><n>Input: Where does the average citizen go for the best food?

Choices:  A: go shopping B: generous C: earn money D: have money E: gift buyer<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "gift buyer" (E) is very general. This person is likely to gift many things, which doesn't make them gift buyers.<n><n>The phrases "money" (B) and"earn money" (D) aren't as specific as the remaining options. Someone who buys gifts isn't necessarily wealthy, so "having money" (D) is too general a description of a gift-bearing person.<n><n>That leaves the answer to be "generous" - which implies that one is spending money on others, the exact activity required to buy gifts.<n>So the final option is E: generous. The final answer is E: generous

Choices:  A: hospital bed B: legroom C: spinning wheel D: grand piano E: rhythm<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The first step to answer this question is to determine what exactly is happening.<n><n>The option "she kept her leg bouning" (B) is incorrect because "keeping" implies continuous movement. If it was "kept and then bouncing", that would make sense, but "bouncing" doesn't convey any action that she might have taken.<n><n>The option D, "grand piano," is another possibility. The answer, "spinning wheel," can be interpreted as a musical reference, and in the scenario, the object that the girl is operating is what we would call in the U.S. a "spinning wheel", which is similar to a "spinning mop" or "spinning brush" in the context of cleaning your home.<n><n>The options "hospital bed" (A) and "she was processing the wool" (C) are more likely the answers. However, none of these options imply what she was doing while using the "spinning wheel" or a "hospital bed," so they are irrelevant to answering the question. <n><n>In answer to the question, the final answer is D: grand piano<n><n>Input: You have a broken machine, what are you doing in such a case?

The process of fixing it can be further broken down into its components, so the question can be analyzed at a higher level.<n><n>The answer choices seem to suggest different methods of fixing the machine.<n><n>"Putting your hand in it" (E), while being an unusual practice in repairing an appliance, is still viable if the damage to the machine is severe.<n><n>"Put on screws" (B) implies that the problem has been localized, which means that the damage has been isolated. The machine, in that case, has not been broken down in order to repair it.<n><n>Option A is also ambiguous.

This is because "sleeping" can refer to anything from snoozing to REM cycles, which don't require sound at all. This choice covers every possibility and the correct answer.<n>So the final  answer is A: loss of consciousnes<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the follwong multiple choice question.<n>Input: Which of the following terms is the least well known in America?

While we have never played it, it strikes us as being a well-known term in the US. That being said, the definition includes "play," which isn't necessary, so we can choose this.<n>Then, let's check Arsenic (5). The definition includes "medicine," which isn't in the list of answers, so we can't choose this one.<n>Then, let us check Altocumulus (2). The definition includes the phrasing "fair weather condition," and this is most easily explained by the word "weather." "Weather" is in the list of answers we have been given.<n>Now we check Inhaler (3).

Choices:  A: rural area B: africa C: ohio D: big city E: tribe<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Think about the definition of a village.<n>A village is a small human settlement which typically consists of a cluster of houses.<n>A village differs from a city in that it is not large enough to qualify as a city. Usually, a village consists of one or two neighborhoods.<n>Think of the opposite of a village. A town would be the opposite of a village, which is another settlement with a small number of houses.<n><n>To decide that a "town" would be the opposite of "a village," you should consider what the word "opposite" means. To find the opposite of a word, you should identify the antonym. An antonym is the opposite of a word.<n>In this case, you see that the "opposite" is used in the word "oppositeness," so you should look for an antonym in "oppositeness." You can find antonyms by using the Thesaurus.<n><n>After using the Thesauris, you can find the phrase "oppositeness" on page 8. The opposite of a village is a town, and you can confirm this in your own dictionary if you like.<n><n>Input: What does an astronaut eat in space? Choices:  Canned peas D: tacos E: bacon F: corn H: ramen<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The astronauts in space eat food packed on the space shuttle. These often include taco shells, peas, canned peas and diced ham or bacon.<n>An astronaut can eat, for the most part, whatever he/she has eaten before. The main diet on the space shuttles should be in line with the astronaut's personal diet.<n>The astronaut's diet is often based on the USDA's food pyramid. There are six levels of this pyramid.<n>Astronaut's diet levels can go from 1 to 6. The pyramid of the food group (25%) represents fats and sweets. The energy-giving grains (48%) represent bread, rice, cereal, crackers, pasta and cooked food. The protein group (14%) includes dairy and other products you can choose from. Fresh and dried fruit (7

Choices:  A: swimming pool B: pond C: lake D: bathe in E: childrens pool<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In line with the scenario, shallow water is the best choice among the options that are possible here. As such, it answers the question the lab results had been compiled that  the scientist began analaysing because he wanted what?<n>But this choice is not mentioned, rather is just the best guess among the options. We can choose either option but that not mentioned. The one mentioned here 'is a hot spot among all locals' means is possible in that area is to have a hot spot so to be hot spot means something specific. Not the kind of hot spots we are looking for is that the thing. To narrow down the options, we need to check whether the lake contains water shallow enough for children so for that lake is best choice from the options. So lake 'has a beach with shallow sandy shores which is a natural swimming pool' means it's natural swimming pool.

You have exactly one tablespoon of each ingredient. You want to make a meal, but you only have enough ingredients for 3 meals.  Choice A and B are incorrect, because they give you enough ingredients to make less than 3 meals. What meal would you make? Choices:  C: salmon with mushrooms D: foul with peppers E: sardines with garlic F: meatballs with salt<n><n>Output: Answer: F. Answer: F. There are eight meal options (A-I) listed along the top row with 3 columns of meal options listed below, with 2 choices per row and column. The number of meals (from left to<n>right, from top to bottom) that can be made in each row or column is<n>listed on those cells, with “2 or greater” indicated by a red dot. The number of ways you could make any of the eight meals from the top row is 2 (that is, there are 2 ways to make each of these 8 meals). The number of ways you can make a meal from among the 2 meals listed on the left column is 3 (so, there are 3 different ways to make a choice from the 2 meals there). The number of ways to make a meal listed in the 3 left columns is (4 x 3) x 2 =  144. These numbers can easily be subtracted to find that there are 44 meals that cannot be made by the ingredients provided.<n><n><n>### Input: There are two kinds of fruit trees that grow on the farm, apples and cherries.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:I was shopping at a car dealership, what did a salesman do? Choices:  A: appear suddenly B: bottom out C: go downtown D: scream E: roll over<n>Output:		Reasoning: <n><n>In this situation, it's appropriate to assume that the salesman was selling cars, and not other products like food or art. Therefore, we can eliminate options "appear suddenly" (B) and also "go downtown" (C).<n>Option "bottom out" (D) is unlikely, as "bottom out" often refers to a car crash. In this case, we can discard it as well.<n><n>Only option "roll over" (E) remains. We know that a rolling-out sale refers to a sales event or promotion. This would explain why a car salesperson is trying to roll over a sale to you. Therefore, the answer is "roll over."<n><n>So the final answer: E: roll over<n><n>Input: What would you say to your bank if you tried online banking and your account balance was zero? Choices: ⋣ A: Wow, you must have gotten my previous message B: I'm afraid I do not feel comfortable doing business on line C: I'm sorry but I've forgotten my log in D: Can you email me some more detailed information about it E: Please contact me at this number<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>We need to eliminate the word "try," as it's inconsistent with online banking. Instead, we'd expect the online banking option to be something on our user profile, and it wouldn't make sense to "try" online banking.<n><n>Next, the "I'm afraid I do  not feel comfortable..." (C) and "Please contact me at this number" (E) options do not fit the context of this question. If someone has a low account balance, the response they'd receive would likely be an email, or something similar, not a phone call.<n><n>We know that option "Wow" (A) is not correct, because the sentence implies that the respondent has already attempted online banking and has succeeded, not failed. <n><n>The phrase "I'm sorry but..." (D) is a correct response, but it's already implied that someone is having trouble with online banking, so we need the option's phrase to be more specific.<n><n>Only "Can you email me some more information about it" (B) remains as a viable answer. It conforms to the context and purpose of this

Carpet stores have flooring materials such as carpets, inlays, and so on.<n><n>Finally the last option is A: home depot (E), which is a store that sells building materials. It sells a wide variety of materials such as lumber, flooring, roofing, paint and so on.<n>As for the purpose behind the man's shopping, it's to install flooring materials, which is something that can be purchased at a home depot. Therefore, it matches that it will be in these stores.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E Home Depot<n><n>Input: The farmer was planting her crops which had to be picked at what time?

Choices:  a: nothing b: he ducks c: he swerves d: he winks e: he runs<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The same reasoning process from the previous two riddles is applicable here as well. <n><n>Answer "nothing" (A) is a completely unrealistic outcome given what it describes. A rock thrown at a clown would never just "nothing." "The rock hits the clown" (B) is unlikely for the same reason; a clown is a person after all and throwing a rock at an unprotected person would certainly hurt.<n><n>"He ducks" (C) is somewhat more likely than the previous two answers, but given that a clown is wearing a mask, would likely duck or swerve in order to avoid an obstacle like a thrown rock. But no one has ever observed this phenomena, so it remains unlikely.<n><n>Finally "he winks" (E) is far too creative. Even if we were to accept the hypothesis that the clown winks immediately following being hit with a rock, it would still seem unlikely because in order for the clown to recover so quickly, it would require them to have incredible wink power. This makes it an unlikely answer.<n><n>The final option that remains is "he runs" (D), which is one of the most likely options given that the rock just hit the clown with a lot of force. <n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n><n>What is the solution for the age-old problem of what to do with lef

Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer choice E: neighbor's House is the correct one. The remaining options all are not the right plausible outcome.<n>Input: What kind of material is a couch made of? Choices: . A. B. C:. D: E:. Output:<n>Reason:<n><n>Option C: is the right one. The other options don't make sense. The questions have provided us many clues for us to discard any other answers except couch.<n># - The couch is the furniture in our house which we use to sit.<n># - The meaning of 'couch' in our daily language will be a kind of sofa or seat. This makes this is the right answer.<n># - The question has used "Couch" with singular form<n># - Therefore, the answer will be a noun (a kind or class of people/furniture item.)<n># Since the couch is of noun class in daily life, it also has a definite article such as "the."<n>#<n># But here the question has used "couch" with article "A", which means it will be a plural form.<n># Since couch is a noun (a class or kind of furniture which we use to sit)<n># in regular language. It also has to be a plural likewise.<n># As a result we discard the three options and find out "the couch" is the answer.<n>#<n># Finally,  output will be The Couch.<n><n>Input:What kind of furniture is a sofa? Choices:  ( A:. B. C: D: E: ) Output:<n><n>Reason:Since "sofa" and "couch" are two different kinds of furniture and they are opposite words in English language. So their usage in the question will give out the clues that the kind of furniture which is used as a sofa will be our answer.<n># So the question is asking a direct answer to what furniture is sitting in the sofa.<n># The question is asked in a direct question form in daily life and is an incomplete statement.<n># Therefore, the answer will be a direct answer to it or a sentence which will include the words furniture and sofa.<n># Since the clues have provided us many hints and we have narrowed down the possible

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:To gain her trust the real estate agent was very polite, delightful and all around what? Choices:  A: manipulate B: charming C: deceive D: exaggerate E: incompetent<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once you understand the context of the scenario, it's time to determine the motivation for the agent's behavior. The options that are immediately eliminated are "deceive" (C) and "all around" which are too extreme and do not fit the context.<n><n>Then, you should choose the option that best fits the agent's intent.<n><n>The phrase "to gain her trust" implies that the agent was indeed being cordial but this does not explain why.<n><n>Options B and E contain qualities that would not be necessary to gain the customer's trust. Charm (B) and incompetent (E) do not add any value to the characterization of the agent so these choices can be eliminated.<n><n>A polite, delightful, and friendly behavior is not uncommon in a business setting so option A: manipulative (B) does not fit the scenario.<n><n>Option C: deceive (C) adds a level of deceit that does not fit the scenario and is not needed for the client to trust the agent. <n><n>Therefore, the answer is most logically B: delightful. <n><n>Input: To be considered a good leader you don't need to possess the qualities that include what? Choices: A: honesty, compassion, integrity B: empathy, kindness, sincerity C: patience D: all of the above<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Reasoning:<n>When we understand the context of the sentence, we note that 2 characteristics are mentioned "empathy" and "kindness". From the context, kindness is the opposite of the quality "manipulative", this means that kindness (option D) is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: During a sales pitch the restaurant owner should appear what in order to make a good impression on the visitor? Choices: <n>A: calm B: charming C calm enough to allow for small talk D: incisive E: intimidating<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>This is a scenario in which a restaurant owner is trying to make a good impression in a business meeting with another restaurant owner. The phrase "to make a good impression" suggests that the meeting is not necessarily about closing a deal, but it does imply that the intent is to get something out of it.<n><n>The options that can be eliminated are

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Remembering past successe is likely to cause what? Choices:  A: problems B: crying C: inspiration D: trauma E: nightmares<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To get to the final answer - E: Trauma, you must first understand the context and purpose of the action.<n><n>The first task of the context analysis is to understand the action. In this case, there are two tasks - the first of which is to use their previous successes to inspire them. It is clear that they are motivated by previous successes, and this inspires them to act, so we can eliminate any other motivations.<n><n>Next, you must determine what the action is. Remembering past successes, while important for inspiration, is not sufficient for the purpose because it does not tell us whether this causes inspiration or stress.<n>Therefore, the correct option is going to be E; because remembering past successes causes trauma.<n><n>Input:When a doctor takes the temperature of a patient, the thermometer is used to measure A: how hot the patient is B: the patient's level of sickness C: how cold the patient is D: the patient's health E: the patient's age<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>To get the final answer, you must first complete the context and purpose analysis.<n><n>The context is quite straightforward to understand. In the context, the thermometer is "something used to measure" something.<n>This tells us that the thermometer, or the object in the context, is something used to measure, and therefore the correct answer is going to be "A" - "how hot" the patient is.<n><n>From there, the options then tell us what "how hot" the thermometer is used for. For options B and C, it's quite clear that this phrase doesn't make a lot of sense, as they both don't represent the object in the context. Option D is possible, but we already know that "how hot" the patients is going to be the correct option.<n><n>Finally Option E has been eliminated because it doesn't match the context. It isn't reasonable to use a thermometer to measure the patient's age, so we can eliminate Option E as the correct choice.<n><n>The answer is going to be A "how hot" the patiet is<n><n>Input:According to the scientific method, an observation is usually the first step that is carried out when conducting a scientific experiment.

Choices:  A: wall B: office C: space shuttle D: front door E: tent<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>A corner is defined as being at an inside angle at the corner of the outside wall. If a corner has lots of windows, it means that a lot of natural light is entering the space, which would result in higher rent costs. Rent costs are the lowest in the front of the office building, because it is most visible from the street. Corner offices typically also have higher rent cost, because they are exposed to natural light. <n><n>The tent has two windows facing each other. This scenario is unlikely, so we can disregard it. <n><n>Option "wall" (A) is incorrect because there are no windows on the wall. Option "office" (B) and option "space shuttle" (D) only contain one window each, so they also don't fit. Option "front door" (C) is too vague to be definitive - it could refer to the front door of an office, or the front door of a house, or even the front door of the entire building. We can't discount it because some corner offices may have access to the front door, so a specific front door would not be considered a corner area. Finally, option "tent" (E) has two windows - one on each wall. Therefore, this satisfies the requirement of "tons of windows".<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is B: "office"<n><n>Input:Why is there so little red matter? Choices: <n><n>A: not as much as there used to be<n>B: not enough red matter in the supply<n>C: there's no more red matter in the supply than there used to be<n>D: It's more scarce and much more expensive that there used to be<n>E: the red matter supply has not changed<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Not as much as there used has been<n><n>This is an uncommon question type and as such, is rarely seen in real life. If the goal is to improve efficiency, not as much as there was used to be would probably be inefficient for the following reasons: <n><n>1. It takes up more space than there used to be (option B). <n><n>2. It makes the sentence sound redundant. Reducing the amount of something (ie: red matter) is probably something you should try to avoid.<n><n>3. It lacks structure and concision. If you include this clause in your answer

Choices: <n>A: Android<n>B: Windows<n>C: Safari<n>D: Chrome<n>E: iPhone<n>Output:{<n><n><n><n><n><n>Reason:<n><n>Android is a widely used mobile operating system developed by Google. It is designed to work on a variety of smartphones, tablets, and other devices, and it offers a range of features and functionality that enable users to interact with their devices in a variety of ways. As a result, it is a natural choice for the name of a software application that runs on mobile devices to interact with their user interface.<n><n>Windows is not a mobile operating system, and it is instead designed to run on computers, laptops, and other personal computers. While it does include some features that can be used on mobile devices, it is not designed specifically for mobile use and its user interface is not designed to be used in a manner that is consistent with the user interface of mobile devices.<n><n>Safari is a web browser developed by Apple that is designed to run on iOS devices, such as iPhones and iPads. It is not a general-purpose application development platform, and thus would not be a natural choice for the naming of a software application that works with the user interface of a mobile device.<n><n>Chrome is not a dedicated mobile operating system and does not function in the same way as Windows or Safari. It is, rather, a web browser application that runs on a variety of devices, including laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. While Chrome may be used concurrently on a mobile device and on a desktop or laptop computer, it cannot be said to run as a "front end" application on a mobile device, and therefore is not a contender for the naming of a mobile-oriented software application.<n><n>iPhone is not a software application but rather is a specific type of computing device, as Apple itself states on its website at Apple dot com.

However, this option goes out of context - the question was actually asking us what benefit we get from exercising. Tiredness does not give us a "benefit", so it goes out of context and is eliminated.<n><n>Option B: Option B states "relaxation", which is good - that's exactly what we want from exercising. The reason relaxation doesn't work is because it gives two benefits. The context of the whole question is about "exercising" meaning only one activity. By having two, it goes out of context. Eliminated.<n><n>Option C: C states "tiredness", which would mean the same as A.<n><n>Option D: D also states "tiredness".  This gives one benefit, unlike the last two options, so it works well for the question, which is asking for benefit of exercising. We do not need to eliminate it, which would be E.

Choices:  A: celebrate B: have party C: hear crowd go mad D: create success E: reproduce<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question asks for an action that would be considered "a success" in relation to procreation.<n>The first choice, "celebrate" (A), may seem like an appropriate answer at first. But it's actually too general because it could be considered a success regardless of the context. For example, if a person was celebrating their own birthday, it could be considered a personal success even though that doesn't technically involve procreation.<n><n>The next pair of questions are "have a party" (B) and"hear crowd go mad" (C). Both of these choices could be reasons someone might celebrate, but they're irrelevant to the question at hand.<n><n>The remaining choices are closely related: "create success" (D) and "reproduce" (E).<n><n>Ultimately, "create success" (d) is too abstract while "reproduce"(E) is more specific as it refers to procreation directly. <n><n>So the final answer for this question is D: create Success<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below based on the passages and diagrams.<n><n>Input:Passing and Failing<n><n>Output:<n><n>I think this one makes sense right.<n><n>Input:Leadership<n><n>Output:<n>These diagrams are quite well designed imo<n><n>Input:Cognitive Dissonance<n><n>Output:<n>There are diagrams so these questions are also quite interesting!<n><n>Input:Congruence Principle<n><n>Output:<n>This principle has many diagram too<n><n>Input:Airborne Illness<n><n>Output:<n>The question is also quite easy to get even if there is a diagram in the passage.<n><n>Input:Inherent Limitations<n><n>Output:<n>If you learn the principle, you can also understand this question's answer lol<n><n>Input:Virtue, Wealth, Happiness - Cognitive Dissonance Theory<n><n>Output:<n>Just like the one above, the diagrams and the question makes it easy to understand<n><n>Input:Human Cognitive Limitations - Theories<n><n>Output:<n>I feel you gotta learn about this cognitive limitation principle cuz it is the fundamental basis for all of the following questions<n><n>Input:Third Person Effect<n><n>Output:<n>Again, I think

Choices:  A: safeway B: record albums C: record store D: car E: wallpaper<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question is quite ambiguous, but it does at least suggest that one is looking for vinyl. The only thing that is given is that the search is "listening vinyl", and the options provide other possibilities, so the most likely place would be a record store that has those particular records.<n><n>Input:What can help you remember something? Choices:  no option was selected at all. (A) A list of instructions and cues. (B) A reminder. (C) A list of questions to ask. (D) A checklist. (E) A reference document.<n>Output: Reason<n><n>This is a list with a few possible answers, although the question does not say how you remember something.<n>First of all there is not 'A reference document' (E) which is also a list. Next, there is a 'Checklist' (D). This is used to check something, but not really used to remember something. Next, 'A list of questions to ask' (C) is used for interviews, but that is not used to remember something. Then, 'A list of instructions and cue's' (A) is also a list of questions, and can be used as a reference document, so therefore the least likely of the answers. Lastly, 'A reminder' (B) does not mention a list at all, so it is probably the one to choose.<n><n>Input: How do you know if your battery is good enough? Choices:  (A) Check the battery indicator. (B) Check the voltage of the battery. (C) Check that the battery is in contact with the terminals. (D) Check if your battery has a positive voltage. (E) Check your battery's temperature.<n>Output: Reasn:<n><n>Here we can see that 'Check the battery indicator' (A) does actually refer to the battery being good, as it gives information about it. Also check 'Is your battery good enough?'<n>Secondly there is 'Check the voltage of the battery' (B), which is used to check the battery, but not if it is good, so this is also an incorrect option. Next there is 'Check that the battery is in conduct to the terminals' (C) because the battery is in contact to the terminals, and so this has the correct answer.<n>'Check if your battery is a positive voltage

Choices:  A: atom B: anything C: air D: feet E: hands<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option "hands" (E) is definitely false. If a collection of atoms makes up everything you can hold, your hands cannot possibly be a molecule. Not only are our hands comprised of millions of atoms, but they're also comprised of distinct molecules such as water.<n><n>Likewise, option "anything" (B) isn't the case, as everything is made of a collection of atoms. Similarly, option "air" (D) is false. Air is a substance just like all other things in the world, and it's only made out of atoms.<n><n>This means options A and C are impossible. Option C "atom" is the closest to the right answer in terms of meaning. If you look up "molecule", you'll see an example of an atom. And if you look back at the original statement, "atom" is an implicit reference to a collection of atoms.<n><n>So the final answer for this question is A : atom<n><n>Input: If you read the information in our "What does it mean" paragraph, you will learn about the structure of what? Choices: A: molecules B: atoms C: everything D: atoms and molecules E: everything<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Several options are incorrect on this question. For starters, option "everything" (D) is too wide and vague. <n><n>Option "everything" (C) is also too broad. Although it's true that atoms play a key function in "everything," they don't actually make up "everything". That would be the case for molecules, which are not even the direct focus of this question - only their structure is. <n><n>Option C "molecules" (B) is somewhat more accurate, but is not correct. The very nature of a molecule is to be a group of atoms. There are no exceptions to this, as they are still collections of atoms.<n><n>Options C and B are definitely incorrect as they lack consistency, so the answer should be A : atoms<n><n>Input: In the "Molecules" paragraph, you see that the structure of a molecule has what?

This gives us a good idea of what's important in this question: horses need energy to live. Hence, the correct answer will be the option or action that gives them that energy<n><n>From left to right, we have options A and D. Option A suggests that horses eat grass to get energy, however, horses' main source of food is hay, which is grass that has been cured before eating. Therefore, this option is incorrect.<n>Option D suggests that horses get their energy by dominating other horses. However, this is untrue; horses do not get their energy in this way.<n><n>Option C suggests that horses get their food from stables, which is an incorrect answer.<n>The final options are A and B, which are the answer choices. Option B suggests that horses get their fuel from drinking coffee, which is incorrect. Horses do not drink coffee. Option A is correct.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The competition was to see who would be the last one the drop the object, the hard part was you had to have your arm extended straight out while what the object? Choices:  A: holding B: lift up C: pick up D: lifting E: hold onto<n>Output:		Reasoning::<n><n>The purpose of the competition is to see who will be the last one to drop the object. This means the competitors will need to hold the object for the longest time.<n><n>The options "hold" (A), "lift" (B), and "hold onto" (C) seem to be close, but let's deconstruct them and see where the options go wrong.<n><n>"Hold" (A) doesn't seem to hold up given the constraints of the competition. Specifically, competitors must have their arms extended straight out while holding the object, which means they'd need to have both hands holding the object. However, "holding" would require only one hand, leaving the other free to pick up the object or otherwise move the hand around.<n><n>"Lift" (B) would be the correct option in a context where competitors were doing some form of aerial work. In the context of this scenario, lifting is the opposite of holding the object, and it doesn't fit the physical requirement of arm extended.<n><n>"Hold onto" (C) likewise does not meet the requirements of the competition. Although both hands can be used to hold the object, they would have to be positioned on the object, rather than extended straight out, which would cause the competitor to drop the object.<n><n>Thus, the most accurate answer would be "extending". <n><n>Input: It was a big family reunion, everyone brought what? Choices: A: their favorite dish B: their favorite pet C: their favorite dessert D: their favorite child E: their favorite books<n>Output:Reasonings:<n><n>Since everyone in the family reunion brought something, the answer to the question is likely to be something related to "dishes."<n><n>Options "favorite pet" (B), "favorite child" (D), and "favorite books" (E) are ruled out as well, since it sounds like people brought a dish and not their favorite pet, child, or book.<n><n>Option "favorite dish" (A) might be the best answer, but we can do better. Let's narrow it down to the dish itself. If we add in the context of other things people brought, we can eliminate options "desserts" (C) and "dessert" (D). Dessert isn'

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a convenient place for a bus station? Choices:  A: maps B: street C: catch bus D: city centre E: school<n>Output:		Reason: This is an interesting question that requires critical thinking and the ability to understand the context. The primary purpose of a bus station is to facilitate the exchange of passengers between buses, making it necessary that it be in a location that is easily accessible to those using the bus service.<n><n>The four remaining options are all unsuitable. Maps (B) provide information but don't indicate where the bus station is located, the buses (C) operate from the station, and the city centre (D) could describe multiple locations depending on the region.<n><n>Finally we have the option "at school" (E) which doesn't provide a clear definition of where the bus station is, or specify why this is a "convenient" location.<n>Of the remaining options, the best answer is "school" because this makes sense both logically and culturally in that a bus station must be accessible to the citizens who will be using it, so it must be situated conveniently in a location that can facilitate such access.<n>So the final answe is E: school<n><n>Input:What might a teacher do to reduce noise in a classroom? Choices:  Answers:  A: turn the noise down  B: tell everyone to be quiet  C: make them more comfortable D: find a new school  E: give a warning<n>Output: Reason : The teacher in question will likely utilize various methods to maintain order among the students and control the level of noise within the classroom. One such method would be for the teacher to simply instruct the students to "turn the noise down," which would clearly indicate to them where the source of the noise is coming from and emphasize the importance of reducing or eliminating it altogether. <n><n>Option A, "turn the noise down,” appears to be an overly simplistic answer. The choice also doesn’t fully explain why or how the teacher intends to have the student reduce the noise, providing no explanation or rationale for what they should do or how they should go about doing it.<n>Option B, "tell everyone to be quiet," seems somewhat appropriate, but it fails to justify how this activity would reduce the level of noise in the classroom in addition to instructing students explicitly to be quiet<n>Option C, "making them more comfortable," seems like an out-of-place option that is too vague and unexplained<n>Option D, "finding a new

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you put an account book if you are leaving and do not need to bring it with you? Choices:  A: kept at accountant B: purse C: desk drawer D: bank E: keeping track of expenses<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once we determine the intended purpose of keeping an account book, the only possible answers are "being left behind" (A) and "accountant" (B). Of these two options, "being left behind", a simple negation, will eliminate the other options.<n><n>Input: Which of the following terms does NOT explain why a group of animals is called a ‘pack’, and a group of birds called a ‘flock’? Choices:  - 1. An animal's preference for company - 2: Size of the group - 3: A group of a same sized animals - 4. Where an animal naturally exists - 5. A group of animals that are a threat to another group<n>Output: Reason::- We are given three groups of animals: a “pack” is made up of wolves, lynxes, and some other types of predators. This leaves as possible terms “size”, “threat”, and the other word. This means that an animal naturally occurring in a pack of wolves, lions, and other predators is more likely to survive. This answer is probably right because if you look at a definition of a "Flock", you would find that birds are naturally found in groups.<n><n>Input: What do all the animals that are going to be in a "pack" have in common with each other? Choices: 1. They are very loyal to one another - 2. They are of the same size - 3. They are of the identical species - 4. They all like to eat the same things - 5. They can hunt together as a pack<n>Output: Reason:- We are told that a "pack" is a group of wolves and other predatory animals. This means that all of the animals in the pack, including wolves and other lynxes, have each other's "best interest at heart."<n><n>Input: Which one of the following is not what you can do at a car dealership to save time and money? Choices:  a. Buying a used car with several years- 2. Buying a new car- 3. Getting the car loan at the dealership- 4.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a place that someone can go buy a teddy bear? Choices:  A: thrift store B: bed C: shelf D: home E: toy store<n>Output:		To "buy" a teddy bear is a relatively common colloquialism, and so this question can be understood to be asking for the place someone would go in order to buy a teddy bear.<n><n>The options "thrift store" (A) and "home" (E) are both correct, because they both describe a place where someone could purchase a teddy bear. They differ in that thrift store (A) means "to sell secondhand goods", while home (E) refers to "the place where someone lives".<n><n>The option "shelf" (D) does not apply to the question. "Shelf" is typically used to indicate a place to store food items or other items, not a place to buy them. Therefore, this would not be an appropriate option for this question.<n><n>The option "bed" (B) is incorrect because it does not refer to a specific place where one could go to buy a toy. It is more general, and could indicate that someone would purchase a teddy bear at any time. Therefore, this would also be incorrect.<n><n><n><n>Input:What can a person do but not understand?Choices:  A: do math B: drink C: play D: speak E: act<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The phrase "do something but not understand it" makes little sense from a grammatical standpoint. This is because "doing something" and "understanding" are both activities, meaning this phrase essentially implies that doing something will somehow negate its own activity, which is contrary to how grammar usually works.<n><n><n>The question can be interpreted in multiple ways, such as the person cannot understand themselves or cannot understand what the person was doing.<n><n>Both answer-options A and B seem logical and simple as the 1st part of the question. However, "the person can never understand anyone else" is not entirely true as he/she can at least understand oneself.<n><n>Answers C and E are also not plausible as the question does not suggest any activity or object that a person can do.<n><n>So the answer is B: drink<n><n>Input: Why does a chicken crossing the road?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do you do to hold loose papers together? Choices:  A: tighten B: packaged C: bound D: faithful E: compact<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In English, we use the expression "to pack something," which is what option (A) is referring to. As a result, we can eliminate the term "to packaged."<n>Moreover, the prefix "pack" implies action, while the prefix "faithful" implies character. So (C) is obviously incorrect.<n><n>Option (B) suggests binding papers in a way that they do not fall apart, or otherwise become broken or lose structure.<n>That said, the definition of "binding" suggests holding or securing something together, not breaking it apart. As such, the sentence "so you use binding" in the context of "holding papers together" is illogical and impossible to understand.<n><n>Similarly, "compact" is used to describe a small amount of space being occupied. It is used as an adjective when one is discussing the size or shape of something. The term would be misleading if applied literally to what one does when arranging loose papers.<n><n>The final remaining option "to compact," in contrast, fits perfectly. When compacting loose papers, we apply pressure such that they are held in position and made firm, thereby preventing them from falling away.<n>So the final correct answer is D: faithful compact.<n><n>Input: What do we make funeral arrangements for? Choices: 1. A: funerals or ceremonies 2. B: burial or funerals C: services or celebrations D: cemeteries or memorial parks E: memorial services or services 3. A: services or memorial day 4. B: cemeteries and memorial day 5. C: services or memorial celebration 6. D: memorial parks and ceremonies<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>We can eliminate options D and E by looking at their context. Option D doesn't refer to funeral arrangements, but instead to memorial parks, which are a place for people to commemorate a deceased relative.<n>Option E refers to services, but does not make it clear whether they are funerals or memorials.<n><n>Therefore, we can immediately eliminate options (C) and (F). We can also eliminate option (A) because it refers to burials or funerals - the opposite of what the question is asking.<n><n>As a
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:During the brainstorming session there was a lot of talking and what? Choices:  A: obtaining information B: exchange of ideas C: sharing information D: conversation E: gathhering of information<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question is fairly basic, but it's important to remember that the context of the question should be taken into account when choosing the correct option. <n><n>Option A: "information" (A) is a fairly general term for knowledge and data. However, it is usually associated with a sense of authority or ownership. <n><n>Option B: "exchange of ideas" (B) is more specifically related to how new knowledge is shared and acquired. This option is thus a more precise way of describing what goes on in the brainstorming process.<n><n>Option C: "share information" (C) is another vague and general option that is neither specific enough nor indicative of the main task of brainstorming.<n><n>Option D: "conversation" (D) falls somewhere between the vague, general option C and the precise, context-specific B. The fact that information is being shared between people makes it a relatively good option. However, again, it lacks a specific quality that is indicative of the brainstorming setting.<n><n>Finally we get to Option E: "gathers of information". Being very specific and specific to the task of brainstorm, this option clearly shows the true purpose behind the session.<n><n>So there we have it, the final answer is E<n><n>Input: The scientists working in the laboratories had no problems because?  Choices: A: they were well prepared  B: they had a clear target  C: they were good in their studies D: they had good lab equipment E: all of the things<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Again, the first order of business is to understand the context. So after learning that the scientists were at some kind of laboratory, the fact that they had "no problems" (B) is clear proof that they were doing what they wanted - and thus being successful at what they were doing. <n><n>Furthermore, the question itself is vague - "what's the problem?" - leading us to think that there actually might be a problem that has not yet been identified. However, this is not the case, because the scientists clearly state that they have no problems.<n><n>Option A: While it's true that they're at the lab, what do they have to do with their studying? The question has nothing to do with their level of preparation. So this is a dead

Choices:  A: refrigerator B: museum exhibit C: prehistoric times D: museum of natural history E: forest<n>Output:		Reasonable:<n><n>When you think of animals living in New York City, your mind may naturally gravitate towards the prehistoric era. However, there are many animals that still populate the city today, one of which is a mammoth. In the Museum of Natural History in New York City, you can see actual mammoth bones and fossils on display. These fossils are the remains of animals that lived thousands of years ago, but they are now exhibited in the museum.<n>So the answer would be A: the museum exhibit<n>

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Along what feature will you find a rosebush? Choices:  A: park B: in the ground C: hedgerow D: temperate climate E: botanical gardens<n>Output:		Reason: The question is asking what distinguishes the rosebush from other types of bushes. The word "along" could indicate any feature or characteristic of the plant to be identified. <n><n>The most common feature of a rosebush is its color. The question is asking about a rosebush specifically, so an incorrect response that isn't specific to roses, such as "flowers" (B) or "stem" (C), would be incorrect.<n><n>This leaves us with four correct responses: park (A), in the ground (D), hedgerow (E), and botanical gardens (E). However, the two most likely correct responses are park (A) and in the ground (D). Park (A) is the only correct response that directly references roses; in the ground (D) is the only wrong response that directly references rosest. Both of these responses describe physical properties of the actual bush itself - the color (parks generally have them) and its location in the ground.  <n><n>Since it's likely that the question was phrased to be as concise as possible, it wouldn't be uncommon for it to simply ask what the rosebush is "in" without explicitly stating that the bush should be identified as a rosebush. Therefore, in the ground (D )is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: What is the weight of a person's heart? Choices: 1.1 kg, 1 A. A. kg, 10 A. A. kg 2 kg (C) 2000 lbs. (C)<n>Output: The question is asking about the magnitude of a person's weight. The question implies a preference for a metric or kilogram measurement (A. A. or B) over the English measurement (lbs.)(C), making the metric number 2 kg (B) the most plausible answer.<n>The nonmetric number 3000 lbs (A) and the kilogram number 2.2 A. A. kg (C) are both improbable and should be eliminated.<n><n>Input: Is the number 4 a prime or composite number? Choices: The sum of any 90 3-digit even numbers (A) 4 is the only even prime number (B) 4 is neither prime nor composite because it is a perfect square (

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The print was extremely small, as he was reading letter after letter he began to suffer eye what? Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n><n>This question is similar to the previous one, in that both include a scenario where data is analyzed, and involve the term "understanding" (which was also chosen incorrectly in the previous question).<n><n>Again, the first and foremost task is to understand the situation. In this case, the analyst is reading printed data carefully. It is therefore reasonable to assume that he's using optical methods - such as a magnifying glass or a high-powered lens - to look more closely at the print.<n>As we know from the first question, the primary purpose of analyzing the data would be to gain a deeper understanding. To gain that understanding, a scientist needs a more precise understanding of the data. This eliminates options "strain" (A), "happiness" (B), and "thought" (C).<n>The remaining options deal with different forms and levels of understanding. But since the primary purpose is to gain insight, the best answer is the one involving the highest level of understanding - "realization" (D). <n><n>The question includes extraneous information - "after letter after letter" (the letters and not the whole document) - so the other options do not necessarily work. <n><n>Therefore, the final answer is "realization" (E)

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I have a reception with many people attending, where should I be sure to hold it? Choices:  A: grand casino B: large room C: restaurant D: country club E: lobby<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>All other answer choices are incorrect as they do not involve any sort of large room. The reception must be planned and held in a room for people to gather; it would not make sense to hold a reception in a restaurant or casino with very few people; this would greatly reduce any potential of receiving a large turn-out.<n><n>Choices C and D involve large rooms but do not require the room to specifically be for a reception as both casinos and restaurants cater to receptions. A country club, on the other hand, is a separate building from the actual country club itself; as such the people visiting may get lost due to lack of organization.<n><n>If the reception is only intended for a small amount of people, an informal setting such as the lobby would be sufficient.<n>If the reception involves a large group, an appropriate setting would be found within a restaurant and casino in order to fit with the amount of attendants.<n><n>In conclusion, the final answer is E.<n><n>Input:I am a carrier of a rare eye disease and I need to get an eye check, where can I go? Choices:  Eye clinic/hospital  Eye doctor  Optometrist  Ophthalmologist  Opticians<n>Output: Reason<n>Ophthalmologist (b) & Opticians (d) are akin to surgeons and technicians (not a physician).<n>As such, they would be found in a specialized clinic or hospital.<n>If the person is suffering from an eye disease that does not require a technician, then an optometrist (a) might suffice.<n>A doctor (c) is the physician that would most likely treat and diagnose eye diseases. A doctor, however, may not be found at a small practice e.g. an optician's office.<n><n>Choices a, b, d, e are incorrect (opticians, doctors and hospitals etc. are not for eye checkups). The answer is c: doctor.

Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The context of the sentence refers to a person waking up, so our task is to identify the physiological event that is occurring. While there are any number of possibilities, option C, "discomfort", is a specific physiological event that's more likely than others. There are plenty of other possibilities such as muscle aches (which would likely make him groggy instead of discomfort), but "discomfort" fits the context of this sentence the best.<n><n>Input:John realized this was exactly how he wanted to spend his life, so after a few deep breaths, John decided he was ready to start his new job as engineer Choices:  A. The moment B. The year C. The second D. After two months of searching E. After one month of searching<n>Output:Reason:<n>The context of this question indicates that John realizes he wants to spend his life in a particular profession. He's considering whether he's ready for this decision. In other words, John is analyzing what the best next move is. He is not currently doing or experiencing the very thing he hopes to do. In order words, 'John is analyzing' and is not currently 'deciding,'<n><n><n>Input: John knew that if he did not get some rest, he would be too exhausted to do his homework that night.  He knew that he did not have time to take a nap, so he lay down on his bed and put his arms on the side of his head. He tried to push himself into a deep sleep.  Suddenly, a large shadow crept along the wall in front of him and scared him to death. Choices: A. He decided to go to school with no sleep B. he began to fall asleep but found that he couldn't get to sleep. C. he woke back up to his alarm clock D. He knew that he could sleep in his bed if he kept himself awake. E. He lay in his bed until he was too tired to fall asleep.<n><n>Output: 1. Reason:<n>I'll leave the choice E which states that 'John' will lie in his bed until he doesn't have enough energy to sleep<n><n>II) The Context:<n><n>As you can guess, the context is someone trying to fall asleep.

John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In order to correctly answer this question, an individual needs to identify the character's motivation.<n><n>The first thing to note is that John's preference for glass over plastic indicates that he values quality over quantity. In other words, his character traits imply that he places a premium on good-quality items that last longer and don't break easily.<n><n>However, despite his preference for glass, John prefers to be "somewhere else". This suggests that while he may appreciate higher quality goods, he also places a high value on escaping everyday routine and finding something new.<n><n>After identifying John's motivations and goals, it becomes clear that the correct answer is choice E: "anywhere else". By identifying and following his desires, John could successfully avoid his repetitive daily routine and perhaps embark on a new adventure.<n><n>Conclusion: The options that are relevant to the character's needs are "anywhere else" and "own home". The latter choice is more realistic, given that an actual person doesn't have control over what happens with their garbage. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is "anywhere else".<n><n>Input: What does it mean when someone says, "It's a dog's (of something, such as life)?Choices:  A: It's easy  B: It's a problematic C: It's complicated  D: It's not a good idea  E: It's annoying<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>A) to call someone a dog is to imply that they are not very clever<n>B) to call someone a puppy is to imply that they need to grow up<n>C) to call someone a mutt is to imply that they have mixed parentage<n>D) to call someone a wolf is to imply that they could be dangerous<n>E) to call someone a wild animal is to imply that they aren't tame<n>F) to call someone a tiger is to imply that they may have trouble controlling themselves<n>G) to call someone a baboon is to imply that they lack morality<n>H) to call someone a monkey is to imply that they don't belong in a classroom<n>I) to call someone a sheep is to imply that they tend to be submissive<n>J) to call someone a pig is to imply that they can be

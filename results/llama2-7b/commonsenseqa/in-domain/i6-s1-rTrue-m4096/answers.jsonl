Choices: 1. I bet he likes riding bikes 2. I bet he is planning to get a new one 3. I bet he is trying to save money 4. I bet he plans to ride it till dies 5. I bet he wants to repair it first\nOutput: 1) You should eliminate the choices which contradict the statement that the brother has a flat tire that he is not in a hurry to fix. 2) Similarly, you should eliminate the choices which say he would repair the tire first. 3) You should eliminate the options which are not logical reasons to say that the brother has a broken tire. 4) You should eliminate the choice which says he is planning to die from riding the already broken tire.  5) Only remaining is \"I bet he likes to ride a bike\" Option 5 is the most logical reasoning because he already has a flat tire and still he is trying to ride his bike, he must be loving riding bikes.\nSo the final reason is 5) I bet he likes to bike ride.\n\nInput: What does this sentence mean?

The furnace dehumidify is not the best choice either, since furnace dehumidifiers take out the humidity from the air which is good for dry climates, but wouldn't necessarily make the air smell good.\n2) The air filter is best choice for this question.\nSo the final Answer is B\n\nInput: What food typically comes from the water?

We eliminate choice 'E' because it doesn\u2019t fit the context, and also options 'A' and 'C' as they are both outdoor spaces.\n2. Choices A and D have gardens as part of them but they don\u2019t seem to be where Johnny would go to relax his mind.\n3. Option B is a bus station that may have seats that Johnny can sit on. However, it is not relaxing place.\n4. Similarly, choice E may be relaxing place, nevertheless, it is for those taking a rest from a longer drive or to eat, so they are not taking rest from work.\n5. Therefore we can see that Johnny prefers to rest in outdoor gardens away from the bustling city life. \n6. This then leaves us with the option \u201cGarden\u201d, which is the most suitable place for relaxation and is a green environment.\nSo the final choice is C: garden\n\nInput: How is the name of the city, Mt. Pleasant derived? Choices:  It was named after a good friend. It was in honor of a relative. The first settlers in this village were from Mount Pleasants. It has some scenic mountains nearby. Mt. Pleasant is considered to be the richest city in the Midwest region.\nOutput: The name \"Mt. Pleasant\" refers to the village being pleasant to dwell in during its heyday, because it is hilly. This is clear from the sentence that reads \u201cMt. Pleasant is situated on a highly elevated plateau\u201d. Also, the name does not fit with the option that it has mountains nearby.\nSo the final outcome is D: Pleasantness\n\nInput: What is a good word to describe a tall person?

{"idx": 17, "text": "Reason: 1. The word 'backyard' could be referring a literal, physical backyard or a metaphorical state of mind. When one thinks of backyards, the image that comes to mind is often of a pleasant, sunny, and laid-back environment. Although it is a possible backyard activity, it does not really fit the context of cooking slowly over a fireplace.\n2. The word 'barbeque' connotes a party and socializing event rather than a particular method of grilling slowly.\n3. Even though a crockpot is usually associated with slow cooking, in this context it could also be referring to stewing (which may not be considered slow cooking as such, but rather an alternative method that is employed).\n4. The choice of 'neighbor's house' could be a subtle hint for the answer, as you generally have a more leisurely, social atmosphere when using your neighbor's house compared to backyard or restaurant, but it does not capture the idea of slow cooking the way restaurant does.\n5. Hence, from the given answer choices, the most likely situation is one in which the food is prepared in a restaurant.\nSo the final choice is answer D: restaurant.\n\nInput: When does a farmer use a scythe? Choices:  a) In the morning b) At midday c) In the evening d) None of the above\nOutput: 1.This is a question which does not require a specific answer, so the answer of none of the above is the only possible correct answer. \n2. When there is no need to use the scythe, the farmer will not use one. \n3. But there are other times when the farmer does use the scythe. Depending on the context, any time of day the farmer uses the scythe can be accepted as correct.\n4. So farmer using scythe at any time, including morning, evening or even middays is correct.\n5. By eliminating incorrect choices (like b) at midday), we are left with correct choices (like a) in the morning or (d) none of the above).\nSo, we can conclude the answer is (d) none of answer.\n\nInput: What would you wear on a cold winter's night when you want to stay warm?

{"idx": 21, "text": "1) It is important to consider what happens after playing soccer for a relatively long time, as opposed to what happens during play.\n2. We can then think about whether the answer refers to the player or to the audience, or to the event happening in general.\n3. When thinking about the potential responses for the effect on the player, we can safely eliminate F: getting tired. The other options are all related to some form of feelings, which are appropriate responses to playing for a long time. When considering the effect on the player's teammate and other competitors, the player feeling angry about the game is not a suitable response. This leaves us with C: anger.\n4. Similarly, thinking about the audience, anger will not be an appropriate response for an event where players have just finished playing soccer for a longer duration of time. Anger would be likely to be directed at the losers, but they might not be immediately available to be angry at. Similarly, for other scenarios where the competition is ongoing, the response from the audience is not likely to be anger and it is not likely to be directed at players. This leaves us with A: excitement.\n5. Excitement is a response that is common amongst enthusiastic members of the audience. This is a response that could be applicable for both short and long duration events, but is more likely to be an appropriate response when the event is of a longer duration.\n6. Therefore, the best answer is A: excitement.

The options are: A, B, C, D, and E.\n3. A: We eliminate A since we're supposed to worry about being found out and hurting feelings. This indicates that Sean is worried about being found even though he's supposed to lie.\n4. B: We exclude B too since lying and being rewarded with reward money or hurt feelings in case of being caught are unrelated concepts.\n5. C: We exclude C since the worried about being found implies that Sean is worries about being found out and the worried about being in trouble which is contradictory.\n6. D: Same case with D.\n7. E: This is the right option since this choice covers the points that Sean was lying yet is constantly worried and since this choice mentions problems and trouble then we pick E: trouble.\nSo the final Answer is E: trouble\n\nInput: In my opinion you can never have your cake and eat it.

A: Nothing: This means that we agree with the given statement cake and eating cake are two things that cannot be done simultaneously. Therefore we must neither eat the cake or not eat the cake at the same time. This is the correct choice, this is not what the ask is asking for. In contrary to that, this is a very sensible argument that you should not overeat and we might need to apply this to any food.\n4) ii.

Choices: \n A: mouth burning B: nose burning C: taste burning D: coffee burn E: bitter taste\nOutput: 1 The question asks us what is likely to occur when one sips hot chocolate. We can eliminate some options right away. \n\n2 For example, if someone is burning their nose with hot chocolate, they are probably not sipping it. That is an inappropriate answer.\n  Similarly, sizzling one's mouth and bitterness are not the end results of sipping hot chocolate, so they can be eliminated.\n  It is possible to have coffee burns when sipping coffee, but coffee is a different substance and is not a variant of chocolate.\n\n3 Since we can eliminate many of the options, let's try to identify the most likely scenario. \n\n4 When sipping hot chocolates, there is a possibility of having a \"cool off\" taste, but chocolate burns will probably be less likely than burns from coffee or hot water.\n5 While it is still not the most likely scenario, it still holds up. We can therefore rule out the option E: \"Bitter Taste\".\n6 Therefore, the answer from the remaining five options is A: Mouth Burn, and it happens when we have coffee burns. \n\nSo the final answers are as follows: answer choice A", "answer": "D: venice"}

To be clear, a great place to lay is something that has been established to be truly great. \n4.

Beach or basement could be somewhere great to lay in - though they aren't too great in many opinions, but that does not preclude them from being truly great in someone's opinion. \n6. A beach would be great for tan-building and recreational activities and not great for warmth or comfort when trying to keep warm. 7.

Chatting with friends could be an opportunity to share and exchange new information or news between them; however, this is not the most likely situation because chatting is mostly for communication purposes and less for gathering information. Moreover, exchanging information is usually done through speeches or writing and not necessarily just chatting. Hence, we can eliminate this choice.\n5) B: communication. Now, we should consider what communicating with friends is about. What are the main goals of this? It is usually to establish or strengthen relationships and bonds between the people involved, which further promotes a feeling of belongingness. Hence, we can rule out this option as well, because it is not the exact result of the conversation.\n6) C: feel relaxed. Chatting with friends has a tendency to bring you down from a stressful state to one of relaxation. It helps you to get rid of anxiety, improves your mood, etc. However, this does not necessarily include feeling that you have accomplished something. Feel relaxed doesn't exactly imply that, so we rule it out.\n7) D: kill borededom. Chatting with friends tends to help kill boredom by providing opportunities for you to be involved in conversations and activities. But again, killing boredom does not necessarily mean that you had accomplished something important. Hence, we eliminate this choice as well.\n8) E: social bonding. What is social bonding exactly? Social bonding is to build deeper relationships with people by sharing intimate and private information. However, chatting with friends might not always be about building deeper relationships, and more importantly, social bonding can result in feelings of having accomplished something. Hence, this choice might be the best answer to our question\n9) So, the answer to our question should be E: social bonding with friends.\nSo the final answers are E: social bonding", "answer": "E: social bonding"}

This is most likely a proximity sensor as it refers to distance in proximity.\n3) Closeness describes how it is the sensor is used, not what kind of sensor.\n4) Here, the sensor expert would identify what this sensor detects to the customer.  The phrase 'kind of sensor' in the options indicates that the object to be named is a type of sensor. \n5) Near and this would be the wrong object to identify as these terms refer to how close the sensor is used as opposed to what the sensor actually is. \n6) Distance would not be what the sensor is as it is the object that is moved or detected that would be away from an object to be tracked or detected, not the actual sensor.\n7) Proximity would be the correct term to detect distance of an object by the sensor. \n8) Suburbia can be chosen as the answer as it is an answer but not part of the actual context.\n9) Hence, the answer is E: proximity sensor.\nSo the final choice is E: proximity\n\nInput:What would you put a lion on to be sure it would not escape?

Choices: A: June 28, 1776 B: July 28, 2021 C: July 4, 1777 D: 1776 E: 1787\nOutput: 1) 'A' is the answer to this question because America is a country in South America which was founded on June 28,1776. If the statement, \"America\" referred to the name of land in southern South America, the answer should be 'A'.  If we consider that the statement \"When was America founded?\" in the question refers to the meaning of the land in South America which was named \"America\" by Amerigo Vespucci, the answer should be \"A\". Hence the answer is A.\n2) From the given choices, 'B' is the answer because America is a country which was founded on July 28,2021.  If we consider that America is the name of land in South America and America is a country in this context was founded on July 4,1707, the answer should be B. Hence the answer is B.\n3) 'D' is the answer to the question because July 28,1863 is the day when America celebrate The Battle of Gettysburg with a National holiday.\n4) 'E' is not the answer to the question for the same reasons as 'B' is the correct answer.\n5) 'C' is NOT the answer because it is not the date of the foundation of America but a date of the battle of America which took place in the year 1776.\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\n##### Input:  \nWhy do crabs carry around their homes with them?

Student Union - This does not make sense considering the latest fashion. Bookshop is more likely.\n4. Town or City - The statement is more likely to be considering a Town or City. Bookshops are likely and not common in malls, libraries or bookshops.\nSo the final choice is E: Town or City\n\nInput:Where might one be able to get a great deal on a t-shirt? Choices:  I. A: flea market B: clothing resale store C: factory outlet store D: department store E: second hand store\nOutput: 1) Answer is C: Outlet store\n2) Explanation: \n1. The word \"might\", indicates this question is not so objective like \"is it A: Flea Market?\".\n\n2. All the option are possible ways to buy a t-shirt except A: Flea market and E: Second hand store.\n3. The word \"second hand\" also indicated that second hand store only sells second hand items, not original ones. Therefore E: Second hand store is out of question.\n4. A: Flea market is \"out of question\" because flea market usually only sells used (not pre-owned or second hand) items as it is a yard sale. Also, t-shirt may not be sold here.\n5. The question is asking about the possibility of selling t-shirts at a \"great deal\". The word \"great\" may imply \"fair\" price.\n6. Therefore from the options, only A: factory outlet store sells things at discount prices.\n7. Therefore the answer must be C: Outlet store.\nSo the final option is C: Outlet Store\n\nInput:Where can one find new or used electronic devices?

So the clown's dream was not to become a clown.\n6) The man went to school because he wanted to run away? If so, why did he go to school? He was going to clown college and that is not the same as clown college. So the logical answer to the question is to run away with the carnival.\n\nInput: What was the man thinking when he went for the job, but it didn't quite work out? Choices: 1. A: his job 2.

We can determine what was his intention from the options.\n1) What was the man thinking he would do after the job interview? The choices are:\n2) He did not get the job so his previous thought is that he will have to go for another job\n3) We know that interview is not part of job offer. Therefore, the only possibility is that he intended to go for another job.\n4) Only got a job offer (B: another job)\n4. Therefore, the right answer is option C: the interview.\nSo the final correct answer is C: the interview.", "answer": "A: circus"}
{"idx": 81, "text": "1.) As the option states \"he had tripped over a steel rod while building...\", we must first understand what exactly is a steel rod? A steel rod is a piece of steel bar that is rectangular in cross-section. It is usually used to make concrete reinforcement. This suggests that the construction is in some form of concrete. If this is the case, then the construction site would likely be for either A: factory, B: construction site C as he is building, or D: insides of the skyscraper' ands walls, as a steel bar would be needed in both of these scenarios.\n2.) As he is receiving workman's comp... then the construction site would most likely be one that does not require a skyscraper, which narrows down the options to A: factory, B & C: either one of those.\n3.) After further eliminating skyscraper construction, we can assume both A and B.\n4.) If a factory is what he is building, then the most accurate answer would be C: Construction Site as he has no place to work in a factory.\nSo the final option we have is to say that it is Construction Site.\n\nInput:When the turtle came across the log, she thought it was a _________? Choices:  I. turtle II. log III. pebble IV. stone V. rock VI. tree\nOutput: 1) The question revolves around the identification of a certain thing or animal that the turtle sees. The options provide a good selection of words describing possible things the turtle could be looking at.\n2.) When we take the option word by word, log is obviously not a turtle.\n3.) If the turtle were looking at rocks, we would expect it to say \"rock.\" The only exception to this rule is if the option was stone, but since stone is not an adjective like rock would be, it rules out this option too.\n4.) The only exception to the option \"tree\" being a turtle is if the tree were moving. Since it isn't moving, the option would be ruled out as a false statement.\n5.) We are left with IV: \"stone\" and V: \"rock.\" Stone is an absolute statement that means it will most likely be referring to stone.

Choices:  Too busy A: I've been too busy B: I can't afford it C: My mechanic is no good D: it's not important to me E: I'm not sure how\nOutput: 1/2: We can quickly eliminate A, B, and E as options as we understand that the answer will not include an explanation as to why the person's car has not been taken for maintenance. \n1. We don't understand why the person hasn't taken the car in for maintenance.\n2. We can narrow our options down to C and D. The two options will describe why the person has not been taking the car in for maintenance and eliminate another option.\n3. If the answer was D, the owner would have told us, \"My mechanic is no good.\" This is not an explanation as to why we have not seen the car get maintenance.\n4. This leaves us with C, \"I can't afford it.\"\n5. In response to this reason, it might seem we need a third answer option. \n6. This can be addressed by looking into the question. One would normally assume the owner of the car cannot afford to get the car repaired, which leads to a possible answer that the work requires too much money. \n7. \"My mechanic is not good\" refers to the work that is being performed on the car by the owner, not the quality of the mechanic. \n8.

A: go to school B: eat lunch \n Output: The options provide two options regarding how the boy feels about school \n In this question, A is the answer choice which means the boy prefers staying at school \n To understand why, one must analyse the choice of words carefully. 'Go' carries the connotation of an activity to be done \n 'Eat lunch' cannot be considered as an activity because it is a meal.

Marriage is the one-on-one relationship that can be dissolved by divorce.\n2.'Speaking to a lawyer about getting divorce', which suggests that one's marriage is a topic of concern and requires some form of legal action, such as divorce.\n3. However, a divorce is just one form of ending a marriage. 'Being married', 'two people', and'sisters' do not convey the intended meaning of ending a marriage legally.\n4. We also see that'sisters' and 'two people' are not the same thing. Although they are relationships, these two phrases are referring to different relationships other than marriage.\n5. This then allows us to eliminate the wrong choices and focus on B: marriage. \n6. By process of elimination, we then have a choice between A: being married and B: marriage.\n7.

Fuzzy sweaters are definitely not considered \"high-quality\" garments for a simple reason that people buy clothes based on their personal aesthetics and these clothing can have a \"fuzzy\" look to it.\n2. These garments give an appealing look to sweaters worn by those who care about their wardrobe and its aesthetics.\n3.

A person's hurt/hurting eyes can be a symptom of an existing eye infection.\nOption A, B: it hurts; it hurts can not be the answer since the first it indicates singular subject and 2nd it implies plural subject.

While it's true that people can be \"well educated\" even if they're illiterate, it isn't the correct answer.\n3. B: \"knowledgable\" can refer to knowledgeable people in general, but it's less likely to mean \"educated\". It's more common to see \"knowledgeable\" used to describe someone who is well-informed, rather than \"educated\".\n4. C: \"own house\" is only a minor consideration to note. Usually, the term \"well educated\" refers to people who have completed formal education or a course of study, and do not specify which type of home a person may or may not live in.\n5. D: \"have enough food\" is also a possible definition, however it's not necessarily relevant, as well-educated people can have varying degrees of wealth.\n6. E: \"meet expectations\" is one possible definition, but it's a bit ambiguous and it doesn't have to do with the concept of a person's education.\n7. The correct answer is D.

Choices:  Yes: A No: B Yes: C No: D No: E No: F\nOutput: 13: The question gives us a hint, specifically, referring to the phrase, \"bushwacker\". It's possible that the phrase may reference bushes as a location, but it may also refer to bushwhacking.\n2. Starting with no choice that is correct, we begin to eliminate the choices that are less likely to be the correct answer:\na. Option E: No. This is the most general option and it is the least likely to be correct. Even if the lizard is in bushes, it still does not make the hiker a \"", "answer": "B: knowledgable"}
{"idx": 141, "text": "Letters are delivered by individuals through multiple mediums, typically a letterbox, the front door, or the post office.\nWe start by eliminating choices that are unlikely: 'Mail Box' are typically found by the mailman by the door, thus is unlikely to be found by people hand-delivering letters. The options of 'Suitcase' and 'Post Office' are also unlikely, as they represent a different transportation.\nThe remaining choices are: 'Front Door', 'Letter Box', and 'Bowl'. We start with 'Front Door': this is unlikely as often individuals deliver and collect letters at the door, it is the front door. The same is true for 'Letter Box', as letters would be delivered by the postal workers that maintain the box.\nThat leaves 'Bowl' as the correct answer, as people often deliver letters with or in a bowl.\nSo the final choice is B: 'Bowl'.\n\nInput: The first thing we do when we put on shoes is tying them.  But first we what? Choices: A: Put them on B: Remove them C: Put them on and tie them D: Tie them e: Tie them and remove them\nOutput:First we put them on, then we tie them. 'Put them on' refers to the action of putting on shoes, whereas 'tie them', as an action, refers to the act of the person doing it.\nThis means we should start by eliminating 'Remove them'. If we were removing them, we wouldn't need to tie them again in the first place.\nWe can also eliminate 'Put them on and tie them', as the putting on also refers to the action of wearing the shoes, and the word 'and' is redundant.\nThat leaves us with two choices: 'Put them on' and 'tie them'.\n\n'Put them on' refers specifically to the act of putting on. Since there was also the action to put it on first and then tie it, the actual action is what is referred to, thus the answer is B: Put them on.\n\nInput: What might you find stickers for at Daddy's store?

But it doesn't make logical sense either since the question asks why the president attacked and option E only says that he attacked. So, we disqualify this option.\n4) Wage war is also one of the choices so we cannot rule out this option. But the context does not suggest war.\n5) Destroy enemy can also be ruled out since it is one of the choices.\n6) We need to find the answer that doesn't make sense.\n7) Fight enemy does not make sense either since he needs to decide whether to fight or not, so \"kill\" makes sense since he probably decided to kill the enemy.\n8) So the answer is D: \"kill\".\nSo the final answer choice is D: kill\n\nInput: John is feeling a bit out of touch with the latest technology, what could he do?

Newer technology is defined as \"technology that is recently available\".\n4): Older technology is one option. Older technology is defined as \"any technology that is older, or has been used for a longer time\".\n5): Using older technology does not work since John is probably unable to use newer technology so the choice of using older technology contradicts the problem.\n6) Using less tech is out since there isn't enough context provided.\n7) The question doesn't refer to sleeping more than usual and that's why we don't include this", "answer": "A: wage war"}

'New dining table' and 'house' are opposites because a house is typically assumed to have a dining table.\n3. 'House' and 'dining room' are opposites, so we can eliminate B: 'dining room' from the options.\n4. 'Cafe' and 'dining table' do not make sense together, so 'cafe' can be eliminated.\n5. 'Park' and 'in the park' do not make sense since the dining table is a piece of furniture and park is not where a piece of furniture can be put. \n6. 'Formal dining room' and 'park' do not make sense because no one keeps a park inside of their formal dining room. Park and the house in a park do not make sense.\n7. Among 'Cafe' and a 'formal dining room' A: 'cafe' does not make sense here either.\n8. So the answer will be in between C: 'arranging papers' and E: 'house'.\n9.

This option is too broad, a music room can be in a home or a school or a music store. There could be other musical instruments in a music room and this answer doesn't make sense since the question is about an upright piano specifically.\n4) Option B: Music store. This could be a possibility if the music store sells upright pianos and is a suitable place for music lessons in general but this choice isn't the right one since the lessons in particular are about the piano and not other musical instruments in general.\n5) Option C: Music class. This could be a suitable place but this option is too broad and the question is again about a particular type of lesson.\n6) Option D: Medium. This answer is too vague and it's up to the individual's perception of a medium.\n7) Option E: House. This could be a possible place as opposed to learning in a school setting, so this could be acceptable. There could be a piano in the house and this is a suitable place for piano lessons.\n8) Therefore, the answer is E: house because of the fact that this is narrow enough to answer the question.\nSo the final answers are E: house", "answer": "C: music class"}

Options C: that you: The word \"you\" suggests a person rather than an item, therefore this option is also not an appropriate answer.\n5. Options D: Spending money: This answer best matches the intent of the question. After all, you aren't likely to enter the market without money to spend.\n6. Option E: Walking: Although you are likely to walk into the market if you are going in yourself, an item is not likely to be walking into the market on its own.\n7.

Choices: \n  A: dictionary B: tutor C: home\nOutput: The question is asking where a student can learn new words effectively.\n\nLet us start by eliminating a few wrong answers: A: dictionary: A dictionary is not required at all for learning new words as it is simply a book containing a list of known words with their meanings. Thus this option is wrong.\n\nB: tutor: A tutor is a person who can teach words, but this doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be in a formal situation like a school where a tutor might teach in full-fledged capacity.

However, they are not typically the first thing that come to mind when we think about a place with a line.\n2. 'Line' can also refer to queueing as a set of lines. This makes 'play' a more appropriate choice since children would typically come to a play area to queue up.\n3. 'Grass' is a little vague as lines cannot traditionally be found on grass. The other answers have a higher chance of having a line, so the answer is more likely to be 'play' or 'graph'.\n4. 'Graph' is a data visualization tool that may have a line, but the lines tend to be used to represent a collection of data, not something to queue up.\n5. Therefore the answer is 'play', since there are lines at playgrounds to queue children up for turns.\nSo the final choice is A: play\n\nInput: What can cause someone to be afraid to fly without looking out the plane window?

If we had just been asked, \"Where can one find pencils?' the answer would be D: shelf as pencils are often stored on shelves, along with other office supplies.\n4. However, since John's pencils are 'gone' from what they were initially stored, he has to go somewhere to find more. \n5. Therefore, he is likely to go to the office supply store E: Office Depot and get more from there if the pencils were previously stored there.

It isn't limited to spending money on a bus ticket.\n4. \"Sitting down\" is an activity you do to sit or be carried to your destination after boarding the bus.\n5. \"Going outdoors\" and \"sitting down\" are both things you do when you are on the bus.\n6. \"Refusing\" is a reaction to something, usually a refusal to do something, which could be to take a bus. \n7. \"Saving money\" and \"sit down\" on the other hand are both activities which are done for a purpose of convenience, whereas \"going outdoors\" and refusing may or may not be due to convenience.\n8. Hence the only relevant options are: B: Save money and C: Go outdoors.\n9.

Option B: \"satisfaction\" will have to be ruled out since the correct option needs to be more than that, and dogs will tend to be satisfied with any sort of physical exertion that grooming is.\n4. Similarly, Option E: \"late\" can also be eliminated because \"late\" here does not refer to the time of day, but to the quality and completeness of the nail grooming, which the answer needs to be \"correct\" to indicate the right time.\n5. Similarly A: \"training\" could refer to teaching dogs to behave, so it could also be ruled out as an acceptable choice.\n6. Option C: \"injury\" can't be correct here.

Choices: A: sleep B: schedules C: calendars D: dates E: alarms\nOutput: 1.'When the man arrived to the workplace in the morning, he was disoriented and mistaken about what time it was.'\n2. From context, there is little doubt that this man will use his phone and clock to check what time it is, and his first thought of confusion will likely be related to what time it is. Based on this, 'clock time' will be an important clue as to what he is bad at.\n3. Of the options given, only a calendar, clock, or clock time can be a clue. \n4. Alarms are generally not an aid to checking what time it is, although they can be tied to phone time.\n5. Calendars refer to time in a broad sense, so the answer is unlikely to be 'calendar time'.\n6. 'Clock time' is what the man checks at the start of the day, and a clock is what he uses to do so. Therefore, the answer A: clock time makes sense based on these clues.\n7.

Depression: Depression is a feeling of sorrow, distress or discouragement that can occur with a mental illness. The question doesn't seem to be about that; so this cannot be the correct answer.\n5. Dream: This answer is not accurate either because a dream is usually a series of thoughts, images, or sensations occurring during sleep and are not necessarily related to the person's memories.\n6. Pleasure: A massage is usually considered to be a pleasurable experience, but the question isn't about the person's reaction to it being pleasurable, the answer has to do with what greatness the experience brought.\n7. Therefore; the answer has to be nostalgia.\nThis is what nostalgia is defined as: \n\n\"Nostalgia is a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a time when one was happier. The word has literally come to describe a painful homesickness; not for home as such but for a time when life seemed less confusing, simpler, happier.\"\n\nAnd this is what it says about the memory of a massage on vacation in particular: \"Memories can offer a powerful sense of identity as well as a sense of self; the 'who we are' as well as the 'what we know.' Memories serve to stabilize and sustain identity. They anchor us to a sense of continuity and continuing existence.

Even though the person asked for the answer to why one sees no blood when playing soccer, a correct way of answering could be to state that blood is spilled during a soccer game but the fact is that soccer doesn't allow hands to be used during play.

{"idx": 277, "text": "Reason: 1. The term \"fortis\" refers to the Dutch bank named Fortis, which was established in 1990. 2.  Since the 'netherlands' has the capital Amsterdam, the question may seem to have the answer 'a', 'b' or 'd'. But actually, the 'fortis' bank is not an institution located in Amsterdam, rather it is a national bank in the netherlands. 3. 'a' being the capital of the netherlands, 'b', 'd' and 'e' being countries that are not banks, this question can logically narrowed down to be 'b' or 'e'. 4. To answer the question, one has to apply reasoning of 'context'. 5. A person could logically infer that if there were a national bank in Amsterdam, then the capital of the natherlands should be 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd'. 6. However, 'a' is wrong because it is not a national bank. 7. And 'e' is incorrect because it is not 'fortis' bank. 8.

Therefore, it can be eliminated and the final answer is A : acceptance. \nSo the final answer can be A: Acceptace\n\nInput: How long should the pizza last? Choices: 1. A: 1 day\n2. B: 2 days\n3.

{"idx": 289, "text": "1 Reasoning: \n2. What might be the reason for choosing convenience when the customer wants things straight to the door? Likely, this is because the customer might not have someone else to help them carry heavy packages back home.\n3. What would be convenient for a customer to get things straight to the door is to have something that can deliver things right to the door. \n4. This could either be a postal service or a courier service.\n5. Among the options A: mail orders, B: demand satisfaction, C: place money on the counter, D: pay merchandise money and E: spend money, both A: mail orders or B: demand satisfaction can be possible delivery methods, but most likely not D: pay merchandisers with money and E: spend. \n6. Therefore D: pay merchondisers with money and E; spend is ruled out, and A or B, would most likely be the answer.\n7. From this point of view, B: demand satisfaction seems more logical. Demand satisfaction generally refers to things like products you can demand from a company to deliver to a specific doorstep. \n8. This way, it's more convenient to a customer to use the service instead of having to get someone else to retrieve the item from them. \n9. Therefore, the final answer is: B: Demand satisfaction.\n\nInput: In a study of people and time, students were asked what it is not.

These places would be cleaned for holy purposes.\n3) The options all seem to be relevant except for E: synagogue. The other options could be relevant but we can eliminate that option due to specific contextual information (the question is specifically about sacred spaces).\n4) The option'synagogue' does not fit into this particular context since synagogues are places of worship. The question is asking about keeping floors clean in an entire building.\n5) Therefore, the answer can be determined to be E: synagogue since this option fits well within the context of holiness and the use of a specific space.\nSo the final correct answer is E: synagogue \n\nInput: What is found on a road that is used as a place to store something for the long term? Choices: 1. A: shed 2. A: graveyard 3. B: basement 4. B: barn 5. C: pantry 6. D: bungalow 7. D: attic 8. E: shelf\nOutput: Reason: 1. This type of question requires you to consider the specific context and identify what would most appropriately fit with the stated concept. 2. A shed is most likely a storage space on a property that might contain items for the long haul. 3. A barn is another form of a storage space for a long term nature. 4. We are looking for an indoor space, as a shed is outside of the building. 5. A pantry is likely an indoor space in homes that is used for storing food and other items to be kept until further notice, but pantries are inside of the building, and this question refers to outside spaces that are used not just for storage in a long run, but also for storing items for such a function. 6. A bungalow is a type of short term storage in houses, where items are placed temporarily, or in a smaller area. 7. An attic is also a short term storage space located inside the building. 8. A shelf is not the kind of storage space which is used for storing items for the long hail", "answer": "E: synagogue"}

The reason exercise can be healthy and effective in reducing symptoms of addiction is that it reduces stress, which can worsen symptoms such as anxiety and depression and cause or exacerbate certain habits. 3.) Options A, B, C, D, and E all refer to a different benefit of exercising. C: laugh: Laughter is proven to reduce stress and anxiety. E: weigh: Exercising burns fat, which can help one achieve their goals regarding weight and body shape. D: stretch: This is not a direct reason why exercising is healthy and effective in alleviating symptoms. 4.) However, the phrase 'can be a healthy way to deal with', suggests that exercising can be beneficial in reducing and treating the addiction, thereby suggesting exercise in addition to substance abuse recovery. 5.) The only option that can be ruled out is D: stretch. Stretching benefits can include more flexibility, greater strength, improved posture, reduced joint pain, but all of these do not seem directly related to stress reduction, which is why this was the only option eliminated.\nSo the final answers are C: laugh and D: weight.\n\nInput: What is the main difference between a pterodactyl and a duck?

Next, B: container can be also eliminated because containers are provided by shops as well, but containers are not an item given by shops. 6. C: downtown area would also not be an item provided by shops.\n7. Therefore we are left with options A: downtown and B: container. \n8. Therefore we have two options: A: downtown, and B: container.\n9. For A: downtown location, we can assume that there is an exchange of cash for the item at the downtown location. \n10. B: Container is an item provided by the shop.\n11. At this stage, we have B and A as outstanding options, with both being provided by the shop. 12.

Presents - This choice can be eliminated because gifts like presents do not relate to the context of giving life to new children.\n4. Birth - This is a specific type of reproduction; it refers to a single birth, while reproduction generally refers to the process of continuing the existence of something (a species, a lifestyle, a custom, etc.).\n5.

Beer can spoil because of too much heat. When beer is too hot, when it's served, it could cause people to not drink the beer.\n4: Choice C: This is incorrect because a person can't decide the quality of beer just by looking at it.\n5: Choice D: This is incorrect,", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

Choices: A: airport B: boat C: road D: shuttle E: plane\nOutput: The man may have been traveling for business and you could have seen him at an airport, boat, road, shuttle, or plane. The question asks which out of those options you are most likely to see him at, not which is the only location for which you can see him. 1. It is obvious from context that this option refers to seeing the man in person (to say \"see\" without the personal in this sense is ambiguous). Traveling for business would not usually entail traveling alone, so the man would be seen on his trips by associates or business partners. 2. In a business setting, most journeys are made on one of the five options, so there aren't any restrictions on where you could see the man with your own eyes. Therefore, the most likely answer is E: plane.\nSo the final solution is E: plane\n\n\nInput: If the wind started blowing in a northeasterly direction, where would it be going? Choices: 1. A: north B: east C: west D: south 2. A: South China Sea B: Suez canal C: Antarctic ocean D: Great Wall of China E: Atlantic ocean\n\nOutput: 1) Based on the direction of the wind, the north/east/south/west refers to the general direction of the wind rather than specific bodies of water.\n\n2) The winds of the Northwest Passage are not strong enough to move the wind, but rather, the ice on which the wind blows. If the wind is blowing in the direction the ice drifts, this would be moving the wind as the ice moves in a northwesterly direction.\n\nSo the final solution for question 1. is D: West China Sea but for question 2 its C: Antarctic Ocean\n\n\nInput: When an organism is able to self-regulate", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

When a chain ring is fixed onto something, it is typically fixed onto a bicycle. Wall outlet fixtures, though commonly referred to as plugs, cannot be fixed onto a bicycles.

Tool boxes are commonly used as a container to store various repair tools that can often be used during a bike repair.\nSo the final option is A: necklace\n\nInput:If it's raining and you want to go out in the rain and are already wet, it will make you? Choices: 1. feel drier 2. feel cooler 3. feel warmer 4. feel wetter 5. feel itchy\nOutput: The question is about the best way of dealing with wet clothes in rainy weather when you want to go out and be soaking wet.\n1. The rain will make things drier if you're already wet.\n2. Unless you are really cold, you wouldn't want to feel cooler since it would mean you're actually getting colder.\n3. Things usually become warmer when you leave a room and walk back into to it as it's warmer outside. Similarly, if you're already feeling damp from the rain, you wouldn't prefer to feel warmer.\n4. As the question asks for the best option, we can rule out this option and keep the remaining ones.\n5. If the clothes you're wearing are wet, you're wet. So you wouldn't prefer things to feel itchier too.\n6. So the option of feeling better or worse wetter remains.

{"idx": 381, "text": "1, The garage indicates that a car is usually stored inside, or at least parked outside near it.\n2. A modern house or a building could indicate a larger residence, though the word \"building\" can be used to refer to any kind of structure, whereas \"house\" connotes something more permanent and habitable than a building.\n3. Townhouses are typically several floors up, whereas a garage is an area immediately by the ground. This makes the townhouse choice less likely.\n4. A garage can be part or close to the house, and a neighbor's house could be any distance away from it.\n5. The phrase \"automatic doors\" suggests the garage may be located quite a distance away from the house, yet the doors to the garage can be automatically opened with a fob or key card.\n6. Downtown is typically a commercial area with shops, restaurants, offices, and other establishments that do not have a residential purpose.\n7.

Choices: 1: silence 2: barking 3: howling 4: rushing around 5: jumping 6: growling 7: talking Choices: 1. When a dog does not bark, it is either because it is physically unable to bark, or it is not aware of anything to bark about.\n2. Barking can be both positive and negative and could signify the dog's mood or state.\n3. Howling is a different sound produced by dogs and can be a way to communicate with other canines. Dogs can also howl during certain emotional states.\n4. Rushing around could be a behavior that would be more associated with humans, rather than dogs. \n5. Dogs do not generally jump, other than as part of playful actions. \n6. Dogs can growl to express different emotions, but in general, they are not known for talking in the way that humans do. \nSo the correct answer is: 1: silence\n\nInput: The bear was hungry, it dug through a pile of food on the floor and left what behind?

Choices: \nA: zoo B: woods C: pond D: farm E: cage\nOutput: 1: The word \"kinds\" typically means one of two things: species or members of a group, either a genus or people (of a certain social class). \n2: Since the question is asking where one would find these birds, it is obvious that it refers to the bird's species, not genus. \n3: Eliminate A: zoo, B: woods, C: pond, because birds of different species may reside together but are not necessarily the same species. \n4: Then, eliminate D: farm, because it refers to a single organism, not the entire species. \n5: Therefore, we are left with E: cage, which makes sense as it's where a single bird is placed in a shelter.

Given the context of a question, a good starting point would be with common places where magazines might be kept.\n2) 'Doctor' could be included as one of the places where people usually keep magazines, but is unlikely considering it's outside the context of a question and more of a general knowledge type answer.\n3. The option 'bookstore' is not necessarily common as a place where people keep magazines, since most people probably keep them at home or another place that they reside in.\n4. Hence, the options that would stand out more in the context of a question are 'library' and 'home'.\n5) 'Doctor' and 'home' cover people who are frequent mag readers, but the fact that 'Doctor' is not included in the other five makes it less likely to be the correct answer.\n6. Therefore, the answer has to either be A: 'library' or E: 'home'.\n7) Going with 'library' as the answer first, we narrow it down to 'bookstore'. The options B: library and D: home both cover the context of keeping magazines, so only option C: doctor can be eliminated here.\n8) Now, 'home', as an answer, goes back to the same choice 'bookstore'. As with the previous answer, we eliminate option D: home to consider either option A: library or C: doctor. Either of the two options would have been appropriate, but 'bookstore' would have stood out as an extremely unlikely answer to the question 'where do most people keep magzines'.\n9.

Choices: 1. A: Yes 2. B: No 3. C: Probably yes 4. D: Probably no 5. E: Probably maybe \nInput:If we get a taxidymist to create a bear, but then get killed by said bear, do you prefer that the bear does the killing, or the taxidermist? Choices: 6. A: Cause the bear to kill us 7. B: Have the taxidymist do the killing 8. C: Probably the taxidymist 9. D: Probably the bear 10. E: Probably neither \n\nOutput:  11. Both of the questions above pertain to a hypothetical situation in which we have a choice to make regarding a person or a bear.\n12. Let's consider each of the questions individually: \n13. Regarding the first question, in a situation where a taxidermist can create a bear to look exactly like a dog, we are required to determine if we're going to prefer the bear to look like the dog or not.\n14. This is where we use reasoning based on knowing the two objects and the context of the question which is about creating a bear to resemble just a dog. \n15. This reasoning then allows us to conclude that the correct answer is A: Yes.  \n\n16. Reasoning: A person can't be killed by an object, it can only be the other way round.\n17. Therefore, answer choice B, which states that the person would rather be killed by the taxidermist cannot be correct.\n18. Also, we're not allowed to make a choice to be killed by either the bear or the taxidermists.\n19. This leaves us with", "answer": "E: score points"}

Option D: Sympathy or empathy make more sense, but neither of those can be a \"do\" or an action. There are other words that could be suitable, but option D: empathy is the closest to \"hope\" so it is the best choice.\nSo the final choice is D: empathy\n\nInput:What will the speaker be doing when giving a speech?

The option Giving is incorrect option because 'when giving a speech' does not mean to give.\n3. The options Speaking and Listening both are actions. Talking is an action while learning is not so the option Talking cannot be an answer. Similarly, options Speaking and Listing are also not an answer. They are actions so they can be used.

{"idx": 445, "text": "1) The question pertains that where does the \"clerk\" (or, teller in a bank) keeps the checks from one person (customer) to another (clerk).\n2) 'throw away' is not what a clerk would do with one person's checK, because this would indicate that the clerk is discarding the checK that is presented to them. Hence, the 'throw away' option should be eliminated from the choices.\n3. Looking at the remaining options, it's clear that options D: throw away E :box belong to the context of 'how the clerk deals with checK from the person'. \n4.

Choices: 1) A: Eating plants B) Avoid animal meat C) A doctor 2) B: Vegetables 3) C: Plant-based food D: E) Vegan food 4: D: Pill 5: E: Avoid animal product based food\nOutput: 1: A: Eating plants.\nAccording to the friend's own mother, it would appear that vegetables would not be the item that may avoid getting heart attack. In fact, it would seem that you would need to eat vegetable-based food in order to avoid heart attack. Therefore, the correct option is B: Avoid animal meat.\n\n2: B: Vegetables. It is not clear whether they refer to vegetables or vegetable-based. As such, we will assume vegetable-based food, since there must be plant-based food which is not referred to as vegetable here. Accordingly, if a person ate vegetable-based food and did not eat a plant (which is presumably meat-based), they are still a vegan according to their friend's criteria.\nAccordingly, only option D: E: Avoid vegan product based food remains.\n\n3: C: Plant-based.\nThe vegetable may be a plant, and so may be option A: Eating plants be correct.

Hence, option E: hear sounds, should be eliminated\n4) Option B: to have sex or C: to sit down would be the only options that could fall under the category of 'What do humans do when we want to replicate?'\n5) It is more probable that a human would replicate by having sex than sitting down. \n6) Therefore, the most likely options are B: to have sex and C: to sit down. \n7) Since reproduction is a key aspect of any sexual interaction, option B should be chosen as the right answer.

Hence, this phrase refers to the mall's aquarium:\n1) The mall maintenance men are not relevant, as a mall is generally not hiring outsiders to maintain its aquarium. \n2) The department store can't be a carp either. \n3) The fish is an option, but it can't be the mall's carp. The fish wouldn't even know what the mall's fish are.\n4) The restaurant can't be a fish either. Neither can the bakery.\n5) Therefore, the answer to this question is actually A: mall maintenance men, which is a fitting answer choice as malls generally outsource maintenance work, and aquariums in malls are often maintained by third parties.\nSo the final answers would be A: mall maintenance man\n\nInput: When should you drink", "answer": "B: have sex"}

The doctor doesn't necessarily have to perform the tasks, the words \"has to\" means for him to complete them, otherwise people can just assume he completed the tasks.\n3.

{"idx": 521, "text": "1) Since the animals aren't good at swiming, they likely didn't do well in the water.\n2) Among all the options, option E: reproduce asexualy makes no sense as most animals require at least one another to reproduce sexually.\n3) Reproduce sexually makes sense because without reproducing, they would go extinct.\n4) The other options, namely, pass water, bathe, listen to each other, and feel pleasure don't make much sense as these options are rather unrelated to swimming.\n5) We can eliminate these options by looking at the context: the animals weren't adept at swimming so it wouldn't make sense to say that they reproduce sexually, pass water, batk through water, listen to each other or feel pleasure while in water because they probably felt some form of discomfort when in water.\n6) Reproduction asexually may be the only option that doesn't make too much sense but it is the best option.\nSo the final option is D: reproduce asexually.\n\nInput:Ask if the cat is in the yard.

This then leads us to narrow down the choices to B: bake a pie and E: work for extra, so we then eliminate B: bake a peice as it requires more than one ingredient to bake a pie (flour, butter and maybe sugar) which he does not already have.\n3. We now only have E: work for extra as valid choice.\n4. Working for extra hours would not get him adequate rest but have him further stressed.\n5.

{"idx": 529, "text": "1: This question primarily calls for deductive reasoning based on common knowledge of everyday English vocabulary and usage.\n\n2. Let'a look at each option:\n\n3. Option A is Cupboard. This may seem to be the obvious choice as a cupboard keeps many things, tea included. However, from the question, we can tell that tea in its unbagged state is not the intention here. Instead, the teakettle wants to be kept inside the water.\n\n4. Option B is Countertop. This is a type of surface commonly found in kitchens for food preparation. However, the question's use of the phrase \"keep a teakettle\" seems to suggest that this is something a little more permanent, like a kettle in a kitchen. A teakettle kept inside the water would suggest a situation more common in a bathroom, such as that found in B: Countertop.\n\n5. Option C is Hardware department. Again, this option seems to make some sense as hardware departments may typically stock kettles, but they are not particularly known for kettles that are kept inside the water, which is what the question calls for.\n\n6. Option D is England. Although some people may believe that a large kettle is called a \"teakettle,\" such a kettle is not likely to be kept inside the \"water\" as per the question.\n\n7. Therefore, only Option B: Countertop is reasonable as a possible answer.\n\nSo the final answer choice is B: Countertop\n\nInput: Where do the dots go to relax?

The question is also asking where in the house the \"check\" would be done, so the location needs to be related to the location of the electrical connection. \n3. The connection could be in a company because the person could be checking an electrical connection in a company building. The \"need\" is stated as a past tense, and there could have been an earlier connection of some electrical system by the company, which the person requires to check.\n4. The company is then eliminated by process of elimination.\n5. The connection could also be in the \"house\", the actual place where the person lives. The statement \"where did he look\" implies a broader perspective where he may have gone through a routine when performing this check in the house.\n6. The \"house\" can then be eliminated, which leaves us with electrical connections in the \"wall\" or \"airport\". \n7. The airport could be eliminated because the question states the person needs to check an electrical company in his own house, not in an airport.  \n8. Further reasoning allows the conclusion that the person is checking electrical connections for his own house. He could do this at the electrical company or at some other place at his own house, such as the wall. The wall is then selected as the answer because the question asks \"where did he look?\" and not \"where did he find\".

{"idx": 541, "text": "Thinking about the context of the question:\n1. The \"where might he be\" part of the question indicates it's not about where he was previously but about where he might go from his current location afterward.\n2. The location of the auditorium implies he would have gone there by car, subway, bus, foot, etc. and isn't likely to stay in a crowd, within a high school, in the city, or in a theater.\n3. The location seems remote. He already listened to the speech, indicating a sufficient level of commitment to have left his usual surroundings for it. It seems more likely that he went there to listen to the speech and returned to his usual surroundings in one direction.\n4. Hence, we can eliminate options A: crowd B: the city C: high school D: somewhere E: a theater, and conclude that he would probably return to his usual surroundons, either the way that he came, or through another direction via a road, suburbia, etc.\nSo the final choice is B or C.

Although the option is grammatically correct, it appears that the point of asking is for the point of understanding, which is the implicit context of the first option.\n6.

As for D: cupboard, it's an odd place to pick up contributions if that makes sense.\n4. \"grocery store\" fits best as it's related to food, and specifically to canned food, so that answers the picking up part.

{"idx": 549, "text": "Reason:\n1. The context of this question clearly indicates that the wheel was loose during movement which was bound, or at least about to become so.\n2. Hence, a response that's not tight or bound can't be correct.\n3. The phrase 'footloose' comes up when describing a carefree or casual lifestyle, but the context of this question pertains to movement and mechanical devices. \n4. 'Sailing' might work as the correct answer if the vehicle that the wheel is attached to is a boat sailing. But in this context, there isn't anything that would suggest the movement to be associated with water transport. \n5. 'Fast' is a valid response as well, but it's the response that the looseness indicates a 'threaten to fall off'. Hence, it falls outside of the scope of the question.\n5. 'Tighten' and 'bind' would both work in this context, but in this question, we're looking at an option that is a contraction rather than a verb. \n6.

If the match is tied between two equal teams, it makes more sense to say the outcome is 'winning or losing' not 'envy' or'resentment'.\n5.

The remaining choices are B and E, where 'evenly matched' refers to the same number of wins and losses and 'winning and losing' is the outcome itself.\n7. Thus, the answer is E: two winners and since two winners is the opposite of evenly matched, the rest of the choices are not possible.\n8. An example that gives further insight into how it could be interpreted is, \"The teams played to a draw\".

Choices:   A: ice C: solid B: liquid D: snow E: steam \nOutput: 1) If we look at the options D, we can discard them, as the mist is water in a gaseous form of air. \n2) If we look at other forms of solid and liquid, we can discard C and B, because mist is definitely not ice. \n3) Since only one option is left, we can then say that this is a simple example of an evaporating, gaseous form of water. \nTherefore, the correct answer is A: EVAPORATION. \nSo the correct answer to this question is EVAPORATION\n\nInput: What did the police suspect of the person who was suspected of stealing? Choices: A: no stolen item B: someone who tried to rob a store C: his fingerprints D: his signature E: another signature \nOutput: \n1) If we look back at the question, we see a pattern in the sentence.  'What did the police suspect', this suggests only an assumption and no real evidence of the act. \n2) 'This person' implies the suspect is not a group of people, but an individual. \n3) Let's look at the options again and we can discard B, C and E. \n4) Since'suspect' is the same as what the police suspect. \n5) The answer is probably a false assumption with no real proof that was held. \n6) The correct answer", "answer": "C: control children"}

Choices: A: ocean B: creek C: river D: sewage E: rain water\nOutput: 1) When we think of water, we usually think of the ocean, a big body of water covering a large part of the surface of our planet.\n2) A creek or a river is not as well known as an ocean because they are smaller bodies of water.\n3) A sewage is different from water. When sewage flows from a body of water, it is not water. Therefore, it cannot be the most well known form fo water.\n4) Rainwater is different, it comes from the sky, not from the ocean.\n5) A common misconception is that the ocean is the most well known form of wate, but that is incorrect. If it were the case, there would be no more question about this, since everybody knows about oceans.\n6)  The correct option is B- Creek.

{"idx": 593, "text": "1 Reasoning:\n2. Based on the question, the helm is a moving part, not a stationary feature of the vessel.\n3. A helm is a steering mechanism or device which is found on larger boats as opposed to vessels without masts, such as the ones mentioned in the question.\n4. Helm can be found on a paddleboat, but not on a sailing vessel -- it doesn't \"move\" in the picture and is therefore not applicable to this context.\n5. A ship does not have a helm, since it is self-steering and does not need to be maneuvered.\n6. A motorboat does not have a helmsman either, due to its built-in engine that keeps the vessel moving.\n7. A helmsman cannot be found on a tugboat that is a pusher and relies solely on the helm and crew to maintain its course.\n8. Therefore the answer must be D: motorboat.\nSo the final outcome 5 and conclusion.\n\nInput: The chicken's head is being petted by whom? Choices: 1. A: dog 2. B: bear 3. C: rooster 4. D: pony 5. E: goat\nOutput: Reason:\n\n1. We can eliminate certain options by disregarding those of animals that are non-typically domesticated pet animals, such as bears, roosters, ponies.\n2. That leaves us with 1.D: pony, 2.A: dog, 3.C: rooster, 4.E: goat. \n\n3. Since the head is already being petted, the chicken can't be the one petting it, or else it would make him the aggressor. \n4. The chicken can't attack the goat who then wouldn't pet its head, which again, would mean the chicken is the aggressor.\n5. The chicken can definitely attack or harm a rooster, which can therefore attack the neck of chicken, but not pet its head.\n6. The only option that actually makes sense is B: dog, which can easily harm a chicken by attacking it.\nSo the final conclusion and answer is B: dog.", "answer": "A: sailing vessel"}

'Losing money' is also a possible reason but not the most direct response to the question.\n5. Therefore the only remaining choice is 'D: having fun'.

The manager gave the waiter a stern verbal reprimand. 5. The waiter felt compelled to apologize to the customer. 6. The waiter apologized to the customer. 7. The customer didn't pay for his meal. 8. The waiter came back with more dessert.\nOutput: 1.\"The waiter was yelled out in front of the customer\" is an unlikely response to a rude waiter. 2. \"The manager gave the waiter stern verbal reprimands\". This also doesn't make sense in this context. 3. This answer is also unlikely and doesn't seem related to the question. 4. Given the context of a bad interaction between a waiter and a guest, this response makes little sense. 5. The anger of the waiter at the customer is unlikely to result in him yelling at the customer. 6.\"The waiter apologized\" is also an unlikely outcome given the waiter's actions and rude attitude. 7. \"The rude waiter didn't get paid\" is a bit too indirect to be a satisfying answer. 8.

Option 'B' refers to biting of animals by other animals or themselves. This may happen to observe animal biting patterns or the effects on the animal bitten. However, again, this is not one of the many things John has to watch animals doing in his study.\n5. Option 'C' again refers to cancer and how animals cope with it. This may be a relevant observation to make, but it also can't be one of the behaviors, John has to be observing.\n6. Option 'D' refers to being overweight. It is possible to observe and track an animal's growth and how it deals with the effects of overweight on its life, health etc. It may also be relevant in studying some behaviors, but it is not among all the behaviors John has to observe.\n7.

Choice B: trying to learn certainly seems like a good option as it makes sense that studying is one of the ways one can try to get good grades.  \n5.) However, choice C: needing assistance makes more sense when interpreted from the point of view that getting good grades is a mark of intelligence and trying to learn is an action which requires one to be educated in the subject. Therefore, to perform the action of learning, one needs to have knowledge about the subject in the first place, which can come from others. Seeking assistance.\n6.)

While playfulness is associated with the outdoors, and it could be a reason for them to go camping or climbing, this seems too far of a stretch to consider an option at this point. \n4) Option C: own house doesn't say much either, but does imply that they don't mind being away from others.\n5) As with option B, option D: good looking doesn't say much in regards to being outgoing. This seems more like a personality type than a reason one might be outgoing. \n6) Of our remaining options, the only option that makes sense to be the end result of them being outgoing is option E: beautiful.

The audience in a theater is usually more reserved and quiet as there are typically rules prohibiting loud vocal sounds in the audience. Theatre events are also shorter than sports events, so the sound effects created during the entire duration of the show are much less compared to that of a sports event.\n2. As a result, only choice E: events will be able to have a loud audience. The other options have been disqualified as they are not very active or noisy audience, and do not contain much noise in general.\n3.

They did not choose the route in the desert or in the rainforest where the scenery is not developed, nor are there the usual sights of the countryside.\n3. Hence, the answer has to lie among the other options--the unitedstates, the beach, the atlas and the developedland.\n4. The united states do not have scenic routes either as the answer to the question, nor do they have desirable scenery.\n5. However, the beach does have scenic routes, therefore, the answer could be between the atlas and the beach. \n6. The question does not give much clues about the type of scenery that is important as pertaining to the scenic route.\n7. Hence, the answer could be either between the atlas or the beach, depending on what the people find desirable on their scenic route.\n8. The atlas doesn't really have developed land, only developed roads, so it cannot be.\n9. The beach has developed lands, but they would not necessarily cut through it per the question. It could be on the side, or the people could decide to walk past it or through it.\n10. Therefore, the answer has to choose between the developed land or the beach.\n11. The people choose the scenic route for its developed land, because it is important to the development of the scenery on the roads. \n12.

A bullet from a handgun is expelled from the chamber when the trigger is pulled.\n\n2 This is true. The bullet is propelled out of the gun barrel when the trigger is pulled, as this is the only action a pistol can perform.\n3 This is also a false answer.  If the gun fired when the trigger was first pulled the only outcome would be a loud bang as the bullet exits the chamber and is fired.\n\n4 This is true as the bullets usually leave the chamber with a loud bang. \n5 This is also true.

A house provides one with food and eating facilities, but it does not usually allow consummation of food at tables. This could mean eating at a dining room table but this does not necessarily indicate food was provided by another entity. Nor does it refer to using a house as a restaurant. \n3) However, the phrasing of the question provides a clue regarding another context: food sold and consumed at a place where one can also eat the food. The wording suggests a cafeteria or a fast food restaurant. \n4) We can eliminate B: library due to incongruity between eating facilities and library, as well as inconsistencies with the context of purchasing food. \n5) We can also eliminate options C: conference and E: paper.

C: this too, though a common word in use is incorrect as it does not mean the opposite of to love.\n3. D: similarly, this word does not mean the opposite.\n4. So, the answer must be choice E: love.

A wall is something that separates or isolates the locations.\n8) And in suburban areas, walls are usually connected to buildings. The wall is not itself a path for communications from one place to another.\n9) A computer network, however, is a means of communication between connected devices even without physical connection, which is why we disregarded it in the first place.\n10) There could be two sides to a freeway. This would be used to link one place to another through travel but the communication would not be through the freeway itself.\n11) As for the options, freeway and electric circuit are not relevant to the context.\n12) Therefore the answer has to be C: computer network.\nSo the finals answer is C: computer network\n\nInput: To what could I compare a lemon?

This is because A: Factory is for mass production which will \"produce\" a finished product, and B: School can be interpreted as education-related. As school is not an industrial place to begin with, we could narrow down our options C: Grocery Store or D: Band or E: Aircraft.\n3. Therefore, we would take D: band and E: aircraft out.\n4. The last words before the question is \"human expect to find manufacturing\" which hints that man is the answerer (not the manufacturing). \n5. This answerer is a person and not a manufacturing system, thus narrowing down our options to only C: Grocery store and D: Band.\n6. Both words \"Manufacturing\" and \"person\" have common connotation, so we can conclude that Grocery store is inappropriate. This can also be based on the fact that a grocery store usually cannot be considered as an industrial place.\n7.

It is not directed toward employee, as employee doesn't have a say in whether he or she has to open the door or not. It certainly is not toward family. The last sentence hints that this door is not to be opened even for family members.\n3. Competitors should not be excluded; though it doesn't appear that competitors are communicated with on the door, they may still need to be informed. For example, competitors may need to be made aware of products, promotions, hours of operation, and other information relevant to a market.\n\n\nInput: The hunter spotted something out in the woods, the only thing that was moving at the moment.

Choices: 1. In the oven 2. The fridge 3. The garden 4. A tree 5. In water 6. The house\nOutput: The question asks where a person would not be able to find a snake. Anything to do with water would be out of the question as snakes don't like water. A house does not have any ovens or fridges, so these would be eliminated. A garden contains plants and insects for the snake to eat, so that wouldn't be a good place to find them. A tree would have lots of trees, which would be a bad place for a snake. Snakes also aren't as good at climbing as other snakes. Water is very important to a snake (as they are cold blooded), so it would be a terrible place to look for them. Therefore, we can eliminate everything bar a fridge and an oven. However, a snake wouldn't be found there, so we can remove everything bar a fridge. A fridge/oven would not be where a snake is not found, so the correct answer is a garden.\n\nInput: Why would you not go to a doctor if you were suffering? Choices:  a. To get a prescription b.

Similarly, \"from the inside\" could be understood to apply to all the internal components of the car while \"Honda\" is used as the name of the car and is in the context of it being damaged.\n3. Hence, we can conclude that the phrase \"from the outside\" applies more to the car's exterior components like the glass window while \"from the inside\" refers to the car's interior.\n4.

{"idx": 741, "text": "1) Let's first eliminate the obviously incorrect choices. A shop and a house are both locations where one wouldn't shop for a radio. The car is a bit more ambiguous, but unless the person buying a radio also wants to buy a radio mount for their car, the radio is likely to be bought at a shop, not from a car. \n2) The remaining choices are C: shop, D: bedroom and E: space shuttles. The phrase \"get a radio\" suggests that someone wants to buy or purchase a radio. For such an act to occur, it is more likely to happen at a shop than in a bedroom. While buying a radio from a shop seems plausible, buying it from a space shuttle would be quite a far-fetched suggestion. \n3) Among the remaining options shop and bedroom, shop is the more direct answer to buying a radio, and the answer to the question. Therefore, the correct answer is A: shop.\nSo the final choice is A: shop\n\nInput: I want a dog that will bark at squirrels, which breed should I get? Choices: 1) A: poodle 2) B: golden retriever 3) C: boxer 4) D: fox terrier 5) E: husky\nOutput: 1- The first option A: poodle is the one that's least suitable for being a barking dog. Poodles aren't exactly barks, and when they do, they tend to just yelp and howl (depending on the breed).\n2- The second option B: golden retrievers are known to make a deep growling sound but aren't exactly barking, nor are they necessarily barking at squirrels. These are definitely options to consider, but aren't the most accurate options for the question.\n3- The third option C: boxers are known for having a deep bark and can often be seen barking up a tree as well as barking at squarrels. Thus, the answer is C: boxers.\n4- The fourth option D: the fox terrier is a breed of dog, not a breed of squirrel.\n5- The fifth option E: huskys are known for barking", "answer": "C: shop"}

{"idx": 761, "text": "1) Let's interpret the question first. The word \"stop\" suggests that the action of standing in a puddle is something that is being performed when a person isn't supposed to stand in a puddles. Hence, in order for a \"person\" to \"end up stopping\" doing that, there should have been an action prior that the person performed. Therefore, options A and B can be eliminated since the meaning of the phrase indicates action is no longer needed.\n2) The phrase \"puddle\" can refer to water or oil. Hence, in context, we can use option E: \"walking out of...\", as it fits best with the word used to describe the action of doing something and then stopping, namely \"stand\". \"Walking out of\" fits better than option D: \"movement\" since a puddy is by definition a stagnant, stationary body of fluids, and walking out of it would not suffice here.\n3) The answer to the question then is option E: \"walk out of.\"\nSo the final answer ends with option E: \"walked out of\"\n\nInput: Which one might you find after a day of work?

{"idx": 789, "text": "1 The phrase \"everyone\" here refers to the person who was abandoned and who has stopped their marriage with someone else. \n2. When a person is left alone after a marriage, they are likely to be feeling something such as \"loneliness\", \"abandonment\", or \"isolation\" -- they aren't likely feeling any kind of \"pleasure\" or \"happiness\".\n3. To narrow down the options even further, another critical issue is that a person wouldn't feel \"happiness\" after abandonment because abandonment is, by definition, an unhappy occurrence.\n4. Similarly, a person wouldn't be feeling \"pleasure\" either during or after abandonment. \n5. Hence, these options can be eliminated.\n6. Considering that a person might feel \"grief\" after termination of a marriage, this option can be eliminated too.\n7. Out of the remaining options, we know that \"solo\" and \"isolation\" refer to unpleasant feelings associated with isolation. The term \"solo\" is not widely used, and there is usually no need to refer to isolation as \"solo\" since the two of them are synonymous.\n8. The feelings described in \"solo\" are usually those felt by a newly-divorced person, who has just become physically and emotionally divorced from their previously married partner.\n9. Therefore, the answer has to do with abandonment and isolation post-divorce. \n10. Eliminating E: happiness, the answer has to lie between choices A: grief and B: isolation. If it's either A: grief or B: isolation, it can't be A: grief since grief occurs as a result of something previously experienced and gone through, for example, after the death of a loved one.\n11. Since grief is a negative sentiment, it must be E: happiness, which can't be the selected option since the phrase \"abandoned by everyone\" does not suggest happiness. Hence, the answer has to fall somewhere between A: grief and isolation. \n12. Now we can see that the two remaining options A: grief and C: isolation are very similar in meaning, indicating that the answer is something like \"grief\", rather than \"isolation\".\n13.", "answer": "C: isolation"}

Choices:  A B C D E\nOutput: 1: This is a question asking for reasoning based on context and understanding common usage.\n2. You can eliminate choices A,B and E because they make no sense in the context of the sentence.\n3. Choices C also makes no sense because it implies you don't know the person, which would lead to asking whether or not you can understand him, which is an unlikely use of this construction.\n4. We are led to D: I don't know what that person is talking about. This is the best option because it uses the same construction (I don't understand) and makes sense in terms of the context too.\nSo the final choice is D: I don'n understand what that person is talking aboout\n\nInput: Why was it necessary for her to walk 2 miles to the local store?

Choices:  a: buns b: meat c: mustard d: corks e: tomato\nOutput: 1 The context of the question is that of a hot dog. Hot dog making involves buns, meat, mustard, and either tomatoes or corks. The options b: meat and c: mustard are ruled out because 1) they\u2019re components of a hot dog, in this case a hot dog ingredient list would only be a subset of a hot dog. This makes both of those options out. Option d: corks is out for the same reason. 2) Hot dogs are typically made with either tomatoes or cucumbers, in this case we're told that this person is working with tomatoes so it's safe to assume that they're not making hot dogs with corks.\n3) The first answer choice is b: buns.

Choices: \nA: workout B: good genes C: be in a hurry D: be late E: a long time\nOutput: We can infer that you don't look 'old' because your face and body are smooth and youthful.\nHowever, your 'age' is indicated by your actual birthday, which might be far from the time that this statement could have been made. Therefore, the expression 'as old as you are' indicates that for all intents and purposes, you don't look that old.\nThis could mean that either you're in a hurry, which wouldn't be surprising because you 'don't look so old' to a lot of other people, thus making you late and/or rushed; or you've just now finished a workout session, and that's why you are so fresh, toned, and physically well-maintained.\nBut even though you're fit and in good shape, you still don't look very many years older.\nAlternatively, it might be that you still manage to get to work on time (so you're not late at all), but you always move with a sense of hurrying (i.e. in a rush), to get things done properly and on time, and that's how you keep looking pretty young.\nSo the final choice would be B: good genes and a long time because the first two options refer to the same idea.\n\n\n# \n## Author\nVamsi Bandi\n\n## HW\n3\n\n## \n## Evalua", "answer": "A: appear suddenly"}

Only option D: tiles can make sense as the man might want to install the flooring in different places in the house to get different effects.\n4.) Since it doesn't specify which room, the whole house is assumed, hence eliminating options C: house and B: home depot.\n5.) The man might be able to get different effects from different tiles in his house. He might even choose to install the flooring temporarily.

Choices:  A; front yard B; backyard C; front and backyard D; patio E; grass area\nOutput: The phrase \"What would I want in my yard\" is ambiguous because there are several components that form the yard and many other outdoor areas available apart from the yard.\n1. Hence, option E: grass area is eliminated initially.\n2. It would more likely relate to a landscaping company to quote the cost or budget for the job involved, in which case, options B: backyard and C: front and backyard are the most relevant answers.\n3.

{"idx": 845, "text": "1 Reasoning: \n2. We start with options E (hat) and B (bomber), since they both refer to some kind of protection from an outside source and it is probably not the kind of protection that a person would usually wear to protect themselves from cannons or cannonballs.\n3. Choices C (body armor) and D (tank) refer to armor. Thus, these are not a good match based on the criteria \"from a cannon\" and \"to protect themselves from.\"\n4. The phrase \"to protect themselves from\" is ambiguous, it could be interpreted as meaning to protect themselves against a cannon, or to protect themselves from damage caused by cannon.\n5. Option E (hat) could be relevant if it is a protective, armored hat of some kind, which is actually a thing.\n6. However, this is not a well-understood concept, so it is unlikely that our question-giver expects us to understand it. Hence, the options B (bomber) and A (ungulate) are still relevant.\n7. From the context, it can be inferred that \"cannon\" probably refers to cannonballs and not to cannons. Otherwise, option C (body armor), which protects from cannons (with bullets), would be a much better match.\n8. Option D (tank) is not a suitable match based on criterion \"cannonballs\" since a tank is a tank.\n9. Option B (bomber's jacket) is not particularly relevant at present, because our question-giver hasn't mentioned airplanes and only talked about cannonballs. Still, it could possibly be relevant if our question-giver meant it as protection from bombs, so it can't really be discounted yet.\n10. \"From a cannon\" could also mean to protect oneself from the damage that a cannon could cause in the surrounding area.\n11. Option A (ungulate) could be relevant since many ungulates have hard, armored \"hides\" which provide defense, so it's worth considering. \n12. However, ungulates are also animals, and are not normally worn to protect someone from cannonballs. Also, \"ungulate\" was only spoken about once in the question", "answer": "C: body armor"}
{"idx": 849, "text": "1- The word 'down' generally represents a sense of \"not up\", implying a negative or negative connotation. \n\n2. Car is in the noun group, which includes only A: down a river and C: repair shop. All the other options are about taking the car or giving it to someone. \n\n3. Taking a car means you could take your car to the nearest repair shop to get it repaired. The repair shop isn't a place for a car owner. \n\n4. But you can't take your car to the city. You could take your car to different parts of the city, but you could only take it to and from the city. \n\n5. Taking a car to the parking lot has to do with a person taking his car to some location but not necessarily taking it out of the parking lot. \n\n6. Taking a car isn't necessarily about giving your car to someone else unless you want to give them what's in the car. You could, however, take your car to many places to give some things to someone, such as the neighbor's house. \n\n7- Based on the above logic, the answer must be either A: down a river or C: repair shop. \n\n8. 'Down a river' is more negative than 'the repair shop', which is a business where people pay to get their cars fixed. \n\n9. There's more sense to 'down a river' than 'the repair shop'. 'Down a river' can mean going down the street, down the boulevard and down the river. It applies to both the way one travels and the things one receives on one's journey. The repair shop is not like that. \n\n10.

This is from the standpoint of a non-relative but a relative of the presenter such as a maid or neighbor for it is the relative who is asked when the presenter will receive the present.\n4. A relative could have a different perspective and could think that the present should have been opened immediately upon receiving the present.\n5.

There are choices that seem too specific to reasonably be expected of the student, such as 'coming in early to school to ask about homework'.\n3.

Some of the options contain language that is too extreme and not very normal. The student doesn't necessarily get a bad or good grade, but the answer may hint to that.\n5. An even more obvious reason to eliminate an answer is when it is clear that it is impossible for the student to do what is being suggested.

Choices:  Yes (B) or No (D)\nOutput: 1). The question is asking whether it is worth taking out a credit from a second issuer.\n2. By process of elimination, since the choices are Yes or No, all the choices can be answered with logical reasoning. \n3. B: Yes would indicate there is some form of gain from taking out that credit. \n4. D: No would indicate no benefit and also that the choice would be a waste of time and resources. In the context of this question, it's not necessary to take out a second credit. \n5. Therefore, C is correct.\nSo the final choice is C: Not worth it.", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

Let us eliminate all the irrelevant options:\n(i) A: bathroom, The stale smell might come from the kitchen or any other place in the house, so the bathroom option is not relevant.\n(ii) C: cupboard, This option is relevant to the kitchen, but it has a different context of what one would likely do with smell. 'Check for the source of smell' can mean checking if there's an open can of food or some spillage of food, which would indicate that the kitchen smell might be due to an open (but not stale) food can. So it is not correct.\n(iii) E: surface of earth, The answer to this question is quite obviously NOT to check the surface. It is likely that the question is about the smell of the kitchen, and it asks what should be checked for the source of stale smell. It's not about what the source of stale kitchen itself is.\n3. So, we are left with either choosing between B: house and D: space shuttles. There are some relevant inferences that can be drawn about this question to narrow down on this choice.\n(1) 'Stale smell' is quite indicative that the smell seems like it's been there for a while. 'Stale' smell usually has some relation to age (it tends to get worse overtime). If it's been there a long while, then it is most likely to be in some of the parts of the house that may have gotten accumulated dust or some dirt over the time (a place that is rarely cleaned, like the cupboard).\n(2) 'Stale smells' also usually have some relation to the food products that it is associated with (like musty smell, which could come from mouldy food or bags etc., or the burnt smell, which we usually associate with fried food). The smells that we associate with our food and with the things that surround it, are usually the ones that we detect in the kitchen the most. The house that is the biggest (by mass) tends to be a bit more difficult to clean and maintain as the floor space is bigger. So there is a higher probability that if the source of the smelly food", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Procreation entails the successful creation of children.\n3. Party is a word commonly associated with celebrations and birthdays, but is not the correct noun to use in context with'success and 'procreation'.\n4. Furthermore, having a party seems to suggest there is celebration, which is only one part of procreation. Also, hearing the crowd go mad is not the same as achieving success procreation.\n5.

Since it is a general term, any place that provides customers with vinyl albums is where they can purchase \"listening vinyl\".\n3. Of the place and types listed, 'car' is the least appropriate. It's a method of transportation, not a place.\n4. Also since, vinyl records aren't usually sold in the'safeway' grocery stores or in records stores, these choice are not optimal either.\n5.

Choices: 1. A: dwarfism 2. B: albinism 3. C: microcephaly 4. D: Down syndrome\nOutput: Reason: 1. Dwarfism refers to abnormally short-stature people, not to their size as a reference.\n2. Albinism is a genetic condition characterized by lighter than normal skin and eyes, associated with visual difficulties.\n3. Microcephaly refers to a genetic condition wherein infants are born with significantly smaller than average heads. \n4. Finally, Down syndrome or 'trisomy 21' refers to a genetic disorder which includes a range of physical characteristics as well as some form of developmental delay or mental impairment, hence, not a syndrome of self-reference.\n5.

{"idx": 901, "text": "1) The question makes a lot of sense and the final answer would really be to carry people but in this case, the answer really has nothing to do with whether the question makes sense or not.\n\nThe question is asking the purpose of the cabin of an aircraft, which is most likely to carry passengers.\n\n2) Let's first eliminate the options that cannot apply to the cabin:\n\nA: crash: Unlikely, since it's unlikely that passengers would appreciate that the cabin is intended to be crash prone.\n\nB: living: The cabin typically does not have facilities to provide living space for the passengers. (i.e. kitchen, bathroom)\n\nC: slow down: The cabin usually does not serve to slow down the airplane.\n\nD: carry people: Since we can be confident that the cabin is intended for passengers, we can immediately eliminate options A, B, and C. This narrows down the options to E: speed up.\n3) The initial question worded 'purpose' is a bit ambiguous since a plane's cabin could do everything in the list depending on the context. It definitely can be slowed down and/or live in. It can also, obviously, crash or take people, but these things are far more unlikely than the question posits. If we ask about the purpose of the cabin, the answer is that it's for the comfort of the passengers. If we ask about its primary function, this changes as the most likely answer is now carry people. Since purpose also means intention, it makes sense to go back to the cabin purpose as carrying people.\n4) All the remaining options refer to the primary function:\n\nE: speed up: Can't be as the cabin slows down the airplane and allows passengers to survive the crash.\n\nD: The cabin can only carry people and this is the only function it has.\n\nC: The cabin serves its primary purpose of slowing down the airplane and making sure the passengers can survive the crash. It also allows them to be comfortable while on the plane.\n\nB: It can be hard to say that the cabin serves to carry people living in there but it does.

B,C,D,E are all methods of cleaning a mug. One might say that these methods are not as damaging to a mug as breaking off a handle, but they are all methods of cleanup.\n6.

Then, what could the grounds around the cottage be called?\n4. Lawns are commonly used adjectives to refer to open, flat, and green grass grounds. However, \"lawn\" refers more to the type of plant as opposed to what it's called when referring to a piece of land, such as the cottage's grounds which could also be called a flower garden, landscaping, flowerbed, or flowerbed.\n5. However, cottages frequently refer to the size of the grounds that the cottage sits on top of, such as a small patch or yard. The grounds are the piece of land surrounding the cottage, and the cottage in the question does not seem large enough to be called \"yard\".\n6. Consequently, the grounds can be called several options:\n- The cottage sits at the center of a small piece of land known as \"patch\".\n- \"Patch\" could be referred to as a \"yard\".\n- The answer to the question is \"yard\".", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

Rosebushes are often found in public parks, as part of planting initiatives.\n1. It's possible to find a rose bush in a particular temperate climate ecosytem, but this wouldn't always define where the rosebush is located. It could be growing inside.\n2. Finding a flower that's in the ground is possible, however this isn't an indicative feature for a rose bush.\n3. A rose bush that's planted in a botanical gardens, is likely to be found in a greenhouse, rather than outside.\n4. If you are searching for a rose bush in a garden, there is no feature that gives away its location in particular, unless there is a specific planting arrangement in the hedgerow that indicates where a certain variety of rose bush is located. \n5. Therefore, based on the context of the question, we can eliminate all of the other choices and keep the only plausible option: the rose bush would be found within a park or public green space: A: Park.\nSo the final choice is: A: Park\n\nInput: Where can you find a rosebear?

The question word \u201crose\u201d is actually a \u201cflower\u201d and it is always attached with the plant which consists of flower like structure. \n4.

Choices: 1: bed, 2: computer, 3: TV, 4: mattress, 5: dorm, 6: fridge\nOutput: The question asks which of the following are suitable parts of a college pack. Since the phrase \u201ccollege pack\u201d doesn\u2019t directly convey the meaning of a college pack consisting of just 1 thing, we can start by eliminating the options that don\u2019t seem suitable for a small pack: bed, mattress and fridge.

The dorm is likely used when it is not possible to use your personal home or you live away from home for other reasons.\nNext let\u2019s think about the things that are used in a dorm.

Option D: A family member suggested the best way to proceed.\nOutput: Reason: In this case, both Option A: I went expert and Option B: I looked old issues newspaper are invalid and incorrect options. Option A is no doubt an odd option for the question. A person is trying to make a decision. They want to get advice on the decision they are making but the question states that the person has already gone to an expert. They have already done an option A. But Option A is only a valid option if the person is trying to make the decision AFTER seeing or talking to an expert but the question states that an expert had already been consulted.

Water is typically used in construction, for example, in wet sanding, to smooth down and smooth surfaces after they are cleaned. The reason that water creates a smooth surface is because it reduces friction by reducing the surface roughness._\n2. _Wax can damage furniture.

Choices:  A. have B. use C. not have D. not use E. not both use not use and not have\n\nOutput: 1:The word \"can\" is in the positive form, and the word \"would\" in the question is in the negative form. We can infer that a person would not make an affirmative choice to not use something they have.\n2: Actions are represented by verbs in the English language, and the word \"have\" is a verb that implies possession or ownership. A person who has something would likely choose to use it, rather than not use it.\n3: A person who does not have something could still choose not to use that item.

(Middle East is roughly between Europe and North America. Hence, America and Europe is the \u201cmiddle\u201d between North America and the Middle East). \n7: The most logical place to have a Pizzeria would be Europe because Italy is located in Europe which makes up the largest part of Europe.\n8: Europe is the one that has the most Pizzerias", "answer": "A: depressed"}
{"idx": 107, "text": "1: The word bee has multiple meanings that refer to either the physical insect or the physical pollen, so the question can only be answered by looking at where bees could be found gathering pollen.\n2. Looking at the options, it seems that D: field of flowers is the most likely answer choice. The \"field of flowers\" is often used to refer to a region where different types of flowers grow, like an orchard, garden, farm, etc.\n3. Option A, \"United States\" is not the correct choice as it is referring to the physical bee, not the pollen that it gathers.\n4. Similarly, option E,\"Orchard\" is incorrect as it uses two different meanings of \"Orchard\" to refer to both a piece of land and the field of flowers.\n5. Option B \"Sky\" is incorrect because of the use of the \"is\" verb with the present participle of gathering, which would require that the collecting bee be in flight. This is not necessary since one can see a bee flying in the sky, but cannot observe a bee gathering a portion of the sky.\n6. Option C \"Court\" is incorrect because once again it implies the bee is in flight.\n7. Hence, the correct choice is D : \"Field of flowers\"\nSo the final answer of the question is D: \"field of flowers\"", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

First of all, it can be noted that the dog may bark at the pizza delivery man because 1. he wants 2. the pizza man to leave. Either way, the dog is doing what he knows best.\n2. There are three likely answers. Which would he choose?\n   A. Would he find pepperoni on the pizza, or is it a matter of what the delivery man is wearing, or what he is carrying?\n   B. Perhaps he was trained to find pepperoni to protect his family?\n   C. Maybe he's just barking at the delivery boy to protect his food? \n  We cannot know what the pizza delivery man is carrying. He could be carrying any food, or even nothing!\n  Dogs tend to bark at strangers, period. In general, they don't really differentiate between a delivery man bringing a large pizza, or a person delivering a small pizza. Dogs prefer their food!\n  Therefore, the correct answer is B. The dog sees the pizza delivery person and he wants to protect his food.\n  So the final answer is B. The pizza delivery person.\n\nInput: How can one quickly determine whether the lights are working? Choices: 3. The question asks us if there is a quick way to tell if electric lights are working.\n4.

{"idx": 123, "text": "1.)The man is going for a job interview, and we can eliminate all the options except grooming. Handsomeness and looking good are too broad and can't really be used to refer to grooming.\n2.)Tardiness is an unlikely factor, as there's only a small window of time between getting to the interview location and the interview start time, to ensure the man show up on time. We can assume the man needs to arrive at the interview location well in advance to ensure there are no issues with traffic or unexpected transportation delays.\n3.) Neatness is not a factor since the man may not be using grooming for the sake of looking neat. He may just be using it to look good.  \n4.) Beauty tends to be a broader concept that describes a person's appearance, including aspects of grooming. \n5.) Handsomeness and neatness can apply to grooming but are more likely to refer to other aspects like appearance and/or clothing.\n6.) There is a relatively narrow window of time for the man who is going for a job to arrive at their interview. They don't have much time to groom if they are on time.\n7.) This means that grooming is most likely a factor for ensuring the interviewer perceives the man as someone who is capable of working on time.\n8.) Therefore, the man's grooming is most likely for the purposes of looking good and looking professional, and not necessarily for the purpose of being neat.\n9.) The man wants to portray a professional image to the hiring manager. He does so by grooming himself.\n10.)

There are various regulations in place to restrict people from installing structures that might disturb residents or cause harm of damage to the existing infrastructure.\n2.

If building codes are not followed, the structure might result in safety issues for those using it.\n4. People might be unsure if the structure is structurally sound, so the permit serves as a means to gain assurance of safety.\n5", "answer": "E: neatness"}

It's more likely that the driver who failed to notice the pedestrian was occupied with another task, and wasn't looking out for other road users, rather than the pedestrian walking \"fast\"\n3: Option B: He was obscure. It's less likely that the driver wouldn't notice a pedestrian if it was obscured than if it was walking in the road\n4: Option C: He moved slowly. The pedestrian moving slowly isn't the point of the question, it's more likely that their speed was normal and what the driver noticed was that it was the way they moved that wasn't noticed\n5: Option D: He walked in road. It's not the \"walked\" part of phrase \"walked in the road\" that is the point, it's \"in the road\" part of phrase \"in the road\"\n6: Option E: He walked out crosswalk. This is the option that should be eliminated: a pedestrian in roadway might cross through the crosswalk\n7: Eliminate A, B and C: As we've explored above, there are other options that are more likely to cause the driver not to notice the", "answer": "C: street corner"}
{"idx": 183, "text": "This question tests logical reasoning and language skills.\n1. 'presents' is an item that could be 'here', such as a present from his family, that is sent to him at his new home.\n2.'stay here' is an activity or an obligation that John needs to fulfill, such as staying in his current job.\n3. 'closer' is an aspect of his new job, such as closer to his family's home, or closer to his new home.\n4. 'available' seems to come in the form of a different job that John could have taken instead of his current one.\n5. 'come here' is again in the form of the location of his family's home.\n6. If something could be either an activity (e.g., stay here) or location (e.g., here's a present), it could be a location but not an activity.\n7. Hence, 'come here' is a location, or 'here', while'stay here' and 'available' aren't locations. They're activities and available locations, which are out of context in this situation.\n8. This then narrows the choice down to option C: 'closer'.\n9. With the meaning of 'here' determined, the phrase in question becomes 'John moved away from his home.  He was a little upset that he had moved away from his family, but he needed the nearby job.  Still, it would have been better if the job were closer to him'. We now see that 'closer' is referring to the new job and not the home.\n10. Therefore, the phrase 'closer to his family' will work for 'closer to him'.\n11. 'John moved away from home'. 'John's job was closer to his family'. 'He was still upset to move to the job'.\n12. This makes it clear that the closest option is 'closer': 'He would have preferred it if his job were closer', or 'The new job was closer to his home'.\nSo the final answer in this case is B: stay here\n\nOutput: 1: The plumbing system you're looking for is one that serves a use and doesn't transport drinkable water.\n2: A: oil refineri es.

Sunglasses or visors Choices:  A Sunglasses B Visors C Baseball caps or hoodies or T-shirts that cover the eyes D All of them\nOutput: 1 Reasoning:\nVisors are often used to block the sun, so the audience who wore them were looking at the stage or at something else in the theatre which is not illuminated with sunlight. So they did not see the play.\nBaseball caps, hoodies and T-shirts can't be the choice to eliminate because they are not necessarily used to cover the eyes.\nSunglasses or visor can be both, but sunglasses are more likely to be worn at a play which is performed at night.\nWhen we come to D: All of them, we cannot eliminate any of them because they are all options for wearing things that could be used to cover the eyes, and not necessarily used to block the sun\n2 So what we do is eliminate A: sunglasses, which is the most likely answer, and that narrows down the range of options and we can eliminate B: Visors", "answer": "E: getting good grades"}
{"idx": 195, "text": "1) There are several different hair colors in a family, so obviously, people in the same family don't always share the same hair color. This is to eliminate choice A: brown hair. This choice is also less relevant as the question is not describing hair color.\n2) The question indicates sharing by family members. There is no information about their identity. For example, siblings sharing a car or parents sharing a bed is a very common scenario.\n3) Choices D: will and E: brains do not suggest a shared property in the sense of the question. Choice C: two eyes does not necessarily suggest that a family is sharing the same eyes.\n4) Therefore, the suitable choice is C: names. People in the same family usually share the same name. In this case, even though a family may have several children, they all have the same name with the exception of one. \n5) This means the answer is A: Brown hair.\nSo the final correct answer is A: Brown Hair\n\nInput: It seems as if the girl is looking for what? Choices - What she might have forgotten to bring home  - What her parents bought for her  - What her mom got for the grocery store  - What she has to do next week  - What her dad forgot to get\nOutput: - Let's first understand the entire sentence and look at the context. The sentences say \"the girl is looking for _______\".It is clear from the context that this is what the girl forgot to bring home. So let's consider all the options again. When someone might have forgotten to bring something home it might be either it was not remembered or it was not important to remember.\n- In Case \"What her parents bought for her\" there is a possibility that the parents may not remember what she forgot to bring home because they may have bought it home for her and she might as well forget it. In this case we can eliminate the option.\n- In Case for \"What her mom got for the shop\" it is possible that the mom forgot to bring it because she bought it for the store. This gives us clue that it was not important for her to bring it home. In any case the girl might have remembered it or might have forgotten it. \n- In Case for Choice of \"What she has to do next  week\" clearly this is not in context which indicates that it was not important to", "answer": "B: names"}

What should you leave out when planting around him? Choices:  plant potatoes here, he makes a terrible potatoe casserole A: flower, rose B: bulb, tulip C: bush, dogwood D: bulb, daffodil E: grass, corn\nOutput: This question tests knowledge of gardening and plants.\n1. First, we need to exclude the bulb, bulb, tulips and daffodils options since neither of these flowers should be included with potatoes. Only an above-ground, bulb-producing flower that blooms in the spring would be acceptable. \n2. Also the bush, dogwood option is not relevant because a bush is not considered a bulb, and it's unlikely someone would plant dogwoods around potatoes.\n3. Therefore, the answer has to exclude A: flower, roses since a rose is a flowering plant that should not be used to plant potatoes.\n4. We can also exclude the plant potatoe here option because a potato is actually a tuber, not a plant. A rose, however, is actually a vegetable, but it doesn't belong here either.\n5. We can also eliminate the plant potatoes here choice because it mentions potatoes instead of potatoes.\n6. Lastly, the grass, corn option can be ruled out immediately", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

'Laughter' and 'embarrassment' are human emotions that could be expressed as an immediate response to finding oneself in an unfortunate situation. However, a trip and the associated injury is not a situation in which people usually show embarrassment or laugh. 'Emotions' also includes positive and negative human emotions which should be accounted for by this question.\n3) Since all relevant emotions are accounted for, the answer is likely to be E: 'embarrassment', as it is the most concise and direct emotion in this situation.\nSo the final and correct answer is E: embarrassment.\n\nInput: I thought maybe you were just blowing off some steam; but then again it could be?

While a singer can sing on their own, a singer needs instruments or a band to play music and create a song. Therefore, it is unlikely you would need an instrument like balalaika to sing. There is a difference between what is needed to perform music and what a musical instrument can achieve.\n3. A symphony. While it is possible to sing without accompaniment, it is difficult to play an instrument and harmonize the various songs of the musical ensemble without proper musical instruments.\n4. There are two options for an orchestra: an orchestra that contains a balalaika, or a performance containing balalaika. Option E: orchestra can be eliminated.\n5. Option A: artist's junkyard also does not seem to make sense.\n6. The choice between B: music store and C: singing appears to be a matter of preference. The music store contains a great deal of musical components. The instrument store may be a likely location to buy music instruments. Also, there is no contextual information regarding whether this is a solo or a group performance. Therefore, C: singing may be correct.\n7.

{"idx": 255, "text": "1. \"A good place to get\" is not a very good expression, because one could get any place they might like - a ball might be in the kitchen, under their toddler's bed, on the pavement, at someone else's house, and so on. \n2. What the question is referring to is a \"good place\" to purchase a ball, perhaps at a local store selling sports goods like tennis rackets, sports bags, cricket balls, golf balls, etc. \n3. Therefore, the answer must be D: \"toy store\". \nNow, let's try applying deduction and reasoning. \n\n4. One more thing you could consider is that a toy store typically sells plastic balls, which are not suitable for a game of kick-ball on the road or in a park. So, \"street\" is not an option.\n5. \"Street\" or \"kitchen\" are unlikely, for similar reasons. The latter would require your going into someone's home and taking their ball. \n6. \"Child's hand\" - not a good place because you'll have to wait until a kid gets a ball for themselves, only then would you have a ball to get. \n7. \"Soccer game\" - the ball will not be available or accessible.\nSo \"toy store\" is the right answer.\n\nInput: What do people put in jars to eat?

H: seaweed\nOutput: 1) To understand what people put in jars, let's first eliminate the incorrect answers: \n2. The jars would not hold soup. 3. The jars would be too small for large vegetables 4. The jars would still be too small for meat. 5. The jars would also not hold diced fruits and vegetables, nor would they be ideal for jams and jellies. 6. Seaweed is not typically used in jars. 7.

When one has a birthday it is usually considered in one of two ways, either based on one\u2019s age, or the day that one was born.\n3. Let\u2019s say that Mary is X days older than Paul. If Mary and Paul have their birthdays on the same day, then Mary was born earlier.\n4. On his wedding day Paul is X days older than he was at his birthday, so Mary would have been born earlier than Paul on that day as well.\n5. Therefore option E: the same day as his weding seems most likely.\n6. Let us now check the options on Mary\u2019s birthday.\n7. She is X days older than on her birthday and on her wedding day, hence she was born before her wedding.\n8. Therefore when was Mary born?\n9. The answer is A: before Paul was born.\nSo the final outcome is A:", "answer": "B: house"}

Although the question says 'they (fam) were full of joy', 'angry' and 'losing money' make logical sense.\n5. However, 'full of joy' does not seem to make sense as an option. Also, since there is no mention of anger, why does the question even ask about 'anger'? It could also refer to'sadness', but this can be eliminated.\n6.

At the very least, the question could suggest two options. It could be a question about finding and using a tablet to do homework on, or it could be a question that refers to finding and using his tablet as a \"place\" to do so.\n5) The tablet is used to study and do homework on, as the tablet is used as a place to do so, the question is referring to the tablet as a place to study and do home work, it holds many features.\n6) However, the word \"place\" cannot simply refer to the tablet as there is no other option but to take the next word: \"to\" to mean that it is as a place to find. 7) Therefore, it holds many apps.\nSo, the final answer is A.

First, we need to identify which side of the plate a spoon goes on. \n3. There are many correct answers to this question, they include on the left side, the right side and in the middle. \n4. This means that any of the options B, C, D, E can be correct, as long as they are on the left, right or middle respectively. \n5. However, to simplify the question, and eliminate some irrelevant options, we make the assumption that the middle of the plate is in the center of the plate and the right and left are further to the outside. \n6. This means that the correct answer has to be on the right or left sides. We will therefore start first by eliminating options which are not on these sides. \n7. Option A: bowl of Soup, which is the only one of the choices which is in the center, is eliminated. \n8. Similarly, option E: Glass of iced tea is also not on the right or left. \n9. This leaves us with only 2 valid options which are option C: Table setting and option D: Place mat. \n10.

A virus is not a biological entity that ingests food, but rather is a program of short sequence of code, which attaches itself to program code (usually in a computer) as a part of its life cycle\n4. A computer is not a person but a machine, and therefore, the virus can't work on a computer to cause it to malfunction. \n7. Therefore, we remove the choices 'eating food' and'making computer malfunction' from the list.\n8. Reproduction is not the primary function of a computer virus. It takes the code of an innocuous program and makes it malicious. It might multiply a number of times, but it is not reproducing itself, and it is not a virus that feeds on another virus to reproduce. \n10. So the virus mutates the code of another program. By definition, they are short sequences of code, and mutation therefore changes the code structure, making the altered parts of the code non-functional. \n12. This leaves us with the choices B: reproduce and C: mutate. B: reproduce. So the final answer is C: mutate.\n\nInput: One may have to look out for what if the hiker has a broken leg?

The phrase \"one may have to look out\" is akin to an exaggeration or a saying. \n2.  As such, we eliminate D: leeches because the phrase \"look out\" does not make sense in this context. It should be noted that leeches have been known to cause harm. They are parasites that can leave behind scarring on a person's skin and body. \n3.  As a result, the answer should not be C: copperhead snake. Copperhead snakes do have venom and can cause serious harm.

A little hard to imagine children saying \"toy stores are not interesting\", because it's their usual place to actually interact with toys.\n5) Finally, even if a child didn't find dinner to be interesting, this wouldn't automatically mean it is not interesting to other children in general either.\n6) Therefore, the answer has to come from the two that we couldn't eliminate, soccer games and school.\n7) It is obvious that a child would be bored if he has to sit in a school for an extended time, but when the question is to identify where children find something is not interesting, the child may say the school only if he's bored from the get-go and can't stand the whole experience.\n8) Moreover, if a child is actually having a good time at school, he would hardly consider the place to be not interesting.\n9) Therefore, the only one left is soccer games. Children have the option to watch a soccer match after school or on weekends, it's a much simpler and convenient activity than going to school.\n10) It is also a social context where kids feel comfortable to hang out, interact, and have fun.

First of all, let's understand that the question \"where\" pertains to time or space.\n2. Based on choice B: \"anywhere\", the \"anywhere\" would have to take place during a particular space of time.\n3. It can't be that a person is extremely honest at a certain place for all time. One specific time or space doesn't convey the scope that we are looking for in this context.\n4. Hence, \"anywhere\" can be ruled out.\n5. Also, choice A: \"everywhere/anywhere\" doesn't answer us the place or time element, as we could hypothetically be speaking at an instant in time in this context.\n6. Choice C: \"everywhere\" would have to imply that this person is everywhere at all times and this too doesn't convey the time and place information that we were seeking.\n7. That leaves choice D: \"wherever there is a man\", which clearly conveys the person we are looking for will be in a specific space during a certain time.\n8. That then concludes that A man who is extremely honest will always be found wherever there is a man, at a particular time.\n9. Since there are many answers in choice D: wherever there is a man that fit in with the time and place requirement, the most relevant one is the last - D: \"wherever/anytime there is a man\".\nSo the final  Answer is: C: everywhere\n\nInput:What kind of place is home?", "answer": "D: answering questions"}

This suggests the family must get food instead, which would lead them to go out or order in, which are not reasonable options because of the constraints in the sentence.\n3) Option D (make food) is also unlikely, as the family is unable to cook or prepare meals with only the available, limited resources, which indicates that they would go what, which is one of the remaining possibilities, either go out or get food in some way.\n4) Option E suggests the family already has some food on hand and thus, is possible, but it would have to come from the cupboard, which is why the cupboard may be barren, not because there was no available food.\n5) Therefore, the answer is E: go and get some food.\nSo the final choice is E: go and  get some food\n\nInput: The woman hated the job, it made her feel like she was what? Choices: A: unproductive B: an expert C: a failure D: in trouble E: on top\nOutput: 1.) Given that the sentence indicates that a woman hated her job, it's likely that the woman perceived herself an expert, not an unproductive, failure, or troubled one.\n2.) A woman who hates her job, particularly the parts that are repetitive and routine, might not feel like an expert, so we eliminate B: an expert.\n3.) From the context that the sentence is using the word \"hate\" negatively and does not seem to reference a positive job, it is unlikely that the woman would feel like she is on top of anything.\n4.) Eliminating A: unproductive, C: a failure, and D: in trouble leaves us with E: feeling like she is a failure.\n5.) Therefore, given that it is not feasible for the woman to feel expert (as the job is hated), nor like she is in trouble (the sentence would use more direct and negative words to convey this as \"unhappy\" or \"unpleasant\" instead of \"hate\"), nor like she is on top (since the job is h", "answer": "E: get food"}

A: shaped like something else B: shape shifter C: shape shift D: something else E: shaper F: sharpe\nOutput: 1'Shape' is often used in different contexts. For example, a person can be shaped by the events in their life, a car is of a certain shape, a building can be of a certain shape, etc. \n2. In other words, a'shape' or'shape of something' can be used to indicate that something has a specific form or structure. \n3. Thus,'shape' can also be used as an adjective to describe the form or structure of something. \n4. 'Shaped like something' is a description that implies the adjective'shape' being used. 'A certain shape' is an additional adjective qualifying the noun'shape', and implies the additional information that the'shape' is of a specific structure or form. \n5. Therefore,'shape' can, by means of the adjective function, refer to'shaped like something', 'of a certain shape', or as adjectives describing'shape'. \n6. Hence, both options B:'shape shifter' and C:'shape shift' are correct answers, along with other options. \n7.

This seems to be common sense and is not an interesting explanation. You have appointments because you are waiting to see the doctor.\n3) B: Being late. The patient knows they have a time to see the doctor and may be late, but it does not have anything to do with why waiting for the doctor can be difficult for them.\n4) C: Having time to think. This is a common answer that may seem to contradict the question, but we shall find that this is not correct. The patient probably does not have time to think because they are waiting to see the doctors' office. If they want time to think they just need to ask the doctor a question.\n5) D: Time consuming. This is not a very helpful explanation because the patient is having time consuming tasks due to needing to see a doctor and not just some other time consuming task.\n6) E: Impatience. While it can be hard for the patient to be impatient, this does not have anything to so with why there can be difficulty waiting for the doctor.\n7) Therefore, the correct answer is A: having appointments.

{"idx": 419, "text": "101. The question asks \"Where would you get a shopping bag after someone fills it up with clothes?\". The context makes it clear that it is used to store clothes. \n2. Clothes are not typically found in bookstores, nor are books typically found in clothes stores. \n3. Filling a shopping bag up with clothes would not happen in a supermarket. There are no cashiers in a supermarket to collect and hand shopping bags over to customers. \n4. Lastly, in a mall, there would have to be someone to give the bags as well, but all of the cashiers are at the center of the mall, near the food court. \n5. So one would have to be careful to avoid bangling a shopping cart in the food court. 6. Therefore, we must conclude that the only viable answer is A: shopping cart. \n7. So the final answer is A, shopping cart.\nSo the final choice is A: shopping bag.\n\nInput: If there were no books on the bookstore shelves, where would you be able to find them?

{"idx": 431, "text": "1) When we're asked about something a child would have to 'do after breakfast', it's usually because they would have to do that thing before heading to school or 'before getting on the bus'. \n2) Therefore, we know any activity suggested can't take place just before lunch, dinner, or after getting home, since the question is 'after breakfast'. \n3) Therefore, we can eliminate E: read a book. It makes no sense for a child to read a book between waking up at home in the morning and getting on the bus to get to school later that day. \n4) Likewise, choice B: drop out of school is also out - this choice doesn't make sense either as any possible 'after-breakfast' activity would be complete before the child even wakes up or gets up from bed and is ready for school.\n5) Therefore, we can also eliminate choice C: enter school - entering school occurs at the end of the day, not directly before.\n6) Of choice D: wash up dishes, it makes sense to do it after finishing eating breakfast, but to do it as the child is heading to school later that day would be too late. It would be time to get on the school bus by that point. \n7) Similarly, choice A: drop out of is also out of the question. School attendance is not a choice that can be made \"after breakfast\", but before school, before the school day even starts.\n8) We can now eliminate all choices except for choice E: ask questions.

A county highway is a road in a county\n4. For this question, the context of our question is that of Michigan. \n5. Michigan is a state. States have counties within them. \n6. Therefore, as defined by the context of Michigan, a county highway is a road within a county in the state of Michigan.\n7. Now, lets look at the options-\n8. Option A, can be eliminated as Michigan is not a place where a person can view county highways from the sky.\n9. Option B, C, and E cannot be eliminated as they are all types of maps or countries.\n10. So that leaves us with D as the answer.

Planting plants is not the same thing as seeding them. Seed crops are not plants either. Rather, they are seeds.\n\n5) Farm land refers to the physical property, but it does not make sense to \"plant\" a farm land because it does not refer to a plant.\n\n6) Grow plants is possible, but what does it \"grow\" again and again is confusing. It does not refer to seeds or farmland.\n\n7) Leaving us two options:\n\n8) Seed plants and grow plants are likely candidates for the correct answer. The question says \"he only planted what?\". By context, we know it must be something used for growing plants so he can use it again the next year.\n\n9) Seed plants makes sense as an answer choice as they are seed plants. In the context of plants and nature, seed plants can also mean they are grown and used over many generations.\n\n10) However, if we know that he planted these seeds in the ground, they will grow plants for him to use the next year. We can deduce he planted a plant, but we cannot say it was a seed crop because he does not have a farmland plot that he sows that becomes his seed crop to use again the next year.

We can then eliminate options A: aquarium and E: pacific ocean since they are not relevant to the context of betting with a sharks.\n4. Option C: south pacific has a shark or several sharks, but it's not really an appropriate place to bet on a sports match. Option D: pool hall is too far off-topic.\n5.

Choices: 0: skiing 00: curling. 1: ice hockey 01: figure skating. 2: biathlon 02: speedskating. 3: bobsledding 03: snowboarding\nOutput: \n1: The word 'figure' in 'figure skating' indicates it is a specific kind of sport. \n2: The question refers to a particular type of sport, so the number of options is reduced. \n3: By reading the question carefully, we can see that the phrase 'get above' refers specifically to some kind of flight, so the options don't necessarily have to be related to airports.\n4: Option 0: skiing and option 00: curving do not make any sense in the context of winter Olympic sports, we can eliminate them.\n5: option 01: ice hockey doesn't seem to be a good answer, since the question speaks about a winter Olympic sport taking the reader above an ice rink, not a hockey rink, not to mention it's also a different type of sport from the ones mentioned earlier. \n6: The only option that remains is option 03: bobsled.\nSo the final option is C: bobsledding\n\nInput: What's more likely you need an x-ray for to find?

{"idx": 475, "text": "Reason:\n1. The question asks whether one can find their way along a highway using paper. \n2. We need to look at each option carefully in order to identify an appropriate answer:\n3. Option A or C are obviously incorrect. We wouldn't need to \"find our way\" along a highway if we were already on a highway. Also, a book, map, or atlas aren't made out of paper.\n4. Option E: countrysides are areas outside urbanized or populated areas, and wouldn't be likely to be found on highways, the paper type wouldn't be needed here either.\n5. Hence, none of the options provide an appropriate answer. We narrow it down to B: atlas. Apart from a map, atlas is a book made of paper. This kind of book maps out an area by showing streets and maps of cities.\nSo the final conclusion is B: atlas\n\nInput: How many legs would a dog have if it was standing on two legs and holding another dog on its back with its front legs? Choices: 1. 2 legs and 1 arm\n2. 2 legs and two arms\n3. 2 legs and no arms\n4. 4 legs\n5. 1 leg\nOutput: Reason for reasoning:\n1. In order to know whether 2 legs and 2 arms are possible, we have to know how many legs a dog normally has. 2 legs and an arm is not possible for dogs. \n2. There is no doubt all dogs have two legs, so it's reasonable to consider two options: either they don't have any arms or they have two arms. \n3. The only way for a dog to have two arms, besides humans or primates, is if it's in human form, on its hind legs. \n4. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 legs and 0 arms.\nSo the final choice would be A: 2 legs and 4 arms\n\nInput: How do you help someone who doesn't have something without the need to give it to them?

The correct answer will be a counterpoint to the fact that Sarah found a second heart.\n3. We eliminate the options that do not counterpoint.\n4. Between animal and human, animal is the opposite because animals do not have human heart.\n5. Between antique shop and bedroom, antique shop is a location that is opposite to the result, Sarah opened the chest because she was there.\n6.

Choices:  D: a bird B: a cow E: a fish A: a dog F: a boy cat\nOutput: 1.) This question follows the same line of reasoning as the previous one: \n2. \"she has always wanted to play\" indicates the game that the woman is playing right now is one that she particularly enjoys, and the question is to find out what happened, so she finds a chicken's eggs and what it is the same?\n3. \"has always wanted to play\" is referring to an existing game.\n4. between a boy and a  dog cat, dogs are different because they are mammals, while a boy is a human being.\n5. between a fish and an egg, the fish is an organism that is different from the egg.\n6. between a cow and a chicken, there are no two animals more different from each other than a chicken and a cow.\n7. The only similarity in all these options is the letter D. So if a D thing is opposite to a chicken's Egg, A and B will be eliminated because they are bird and a cow.\n8.

Choices: A: fashion B: fit C: style D: self presentation E: grace\nOutput: As this question pertains to fashion, most of the option choices are likely to be part of the man's footwea.\nHowever, a person's style, the way they carry themselves, would not be primarily related to their footwear. \nTherefore, the choice can be reasonably eliminated.\nA: fashion - Since fashion is so heavily related to footwear, this choice is irrelevant.\nC: Style - This choice is part of the man'sself presenctation overall, not the only component.\nB: fit - It is not clear how the answer to this question is related to the question of the man's fit and grace. We can eliminate it.\nD: grace - Grace is more related to the way a man conducts himself, not primarily to his choice of footwear. This can be eliminated.\nE: B: style - this choice is part of the answer, it remains. \nSo the only", "answer": "D: foot"}
{"idx": 539, "text": "1.\"So, where did he put it?\" suggests that he had just decided where to put his index card, so this question is most likely related to a situation taking place after he made this decision.\n2. If it were before the decision, it would have been more appropriate to ask him where he would put the card before deciding.\n3. Since it is referring to after the decision is made, the answer will most likely be relevant to the place the card was put after it was decided.\n4. Hence, to eliminate irrelevant options, we can eliminate B: oral report option as well as E: card catalogue because neither of these options is associated with card catalogues.\n5. The remaining options could be ruled out similarly since they are not in keeping with what we know of the situation.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be C: \"library\". This is a place where the decision of where to put the card is made, and since most libraries have many book shelves and catalogues, the index card can be safely tucked away by the user in a catalogue or on one of the many book shelves, after he has decided where to put it.\nSo the final choice is C: library\n\nInput: The woman lost touch with her friends, they stopped calling her when she Choices:  A. said she quit drinking B. was making fun of C. wasn't a good listener D. stopped doing drugs E. was rude\nOutput: 1) The question calls for reasoning based understanding the reason a person is lost.\n2)\"Woman lost touch\" refers to a past action or behavior. \"They stopped calling\" also refers to past action or behavior.\n3) If it were the current context where someone is trying to get in touch with someone in the first person, this question would refer more to the present tense rather than the past tense.\n4) In light of this, we can eliminate options A, B, C, D and E.\n5) So the answer must be E: stopped listening. This may be one of the reasons why the person lost touch with their friends. In a typical case, once one is not listening to another person, the conversation can break off or weaken and eventually result in a break-off of communication over longer periods.\n8So the final answer is Choice E: stopped doing drugs\n\nInput: The girl was mad", "answer": "E: card catalogue"}

There was/is no need to mention where the speaker will put the mug after it'd been cleaned/used.\n3) This question is usually asked because the speaker wants to know where the mug might be put temporarily without any specific intention to keep it there.\n4) Since the mug will be put in one of these places in a non-specific manner, they are all relevant answers for the speaker's question but they don't provide enough information for the listener to know where the speaker will actually put the mug.\n5) Since there is no other specific information given about the person answering the question, the listener can't tell from their answer whether one specific place the mug will go to is more or less likely than the other places mentioned.\n6) Therefore, if the listener's answer is specific to one of the places, they can easily guess which of the other places was not meant. \n7) Given all this, the best candidate answer is: D: kitchen.\nSo the final choice is  D: kitchen\n\nInput: Did the fisherman catch the fish or not?

The \"mailbox\" also cannot be the answer since the person had their mail box open but with letters stolen, and not even with the mailbox itself stolen (since a person is more likely to keep their own mailbox closed if it were stolen).\n4.) Likewise, the \"mailbox\" is not the answer since the mailman would likely bring any mail to your mailbox by default unless someone has taken it away, and therefore, the mail would still be found in the mailbox so it cannot contain letters that have been stolen.\n5.) Now that \"Post office\" and \"mailbox\" have been eliminated, we can further refine the answers we have now. Of the four answers remaining, all are logical places to find open mailboxes.\n6.)

It is important to identify that this question is referring to negative effects of divorce when two spouses have to go through divorce, not the effect when two spouses are \"getting divorced\".\n4. When it comes to choosing the answer between lot of grief and depression, there may be more grief because the two spouses have to deal with the impacts divorce can have, whereas depression is a state of psychosis that one could be susceptible to after the divorce happens.\n5. No spouse is not an answer to the question. To be considered, the options needs to be of effect of divorce on the spouses.\n6. Since the options given are of effect of divorce of a couple, not just on the two spouses but also on other people, we can eliminate E: children suffer. Loss of money may have impact on children.\n7. We may be able to eliminate C: children suffer, but the loss of money from divorce may have other impacts on other people's lives rather than in money, so this elimination may not be necessary, but for the sake of discussion, we will eliminate C: children suffer.\n8.

Choices: 10: A: bike B: car C: bus D: bicycle E: train\nOutput: 14. The most efficient way to get to school would be one that ensures minimal travel time, effort, cost, and risk/inconvenience.\n2. In general, most people go to school using public transport since it's most efficient in terms of convenience. (There are some, however, who choose to go by car, depending on location and cost.)\n3. We rule out the car option because it requires petrol, time, and effort.\n4. The bus option could be faster for some routes, but it's not a very convenient mode of transport. Buses could run on schedule, but sometimes they run late or run out of capacity before a person reaches a stop.\n5. For the train, it varies by location, but some train stations provide direct access to school if it's close enough. However, the stations are less numerous than bus stops, and the train travel time could be longer in some areas.\n6. Therefore, the most efficient way is most likely B: bus. Although some people prefer the train because they take fewer bus stops than a bus, this mode also usually takes longer.\n7. As mentioned, it depends on the area the person is living in whether school can be accessed by car as well. \n8. So the final answer is D. bicycle.

This could be likely, considering James seems to have strong interest in space exploration; he is most likely a student majoring in the field.\n4. Option E: library. James could definitely be interested in learning more about space through books, but that wouldn't be equivalent to him experiencing the mar through books.\n5. Option D: school. This also seems feasible, as James could take courses that allow him to experience being on a space shuttle.\n6.

It is unlikely that reading a newspaper would directly evoke anger in a reader, nor is it meant to, particularly in a current events context, as newspapers often report about matters of concern.\n4. It cannot be an emotion because emotion is a feeling response arising from either the internal world of the self or external events.\n5.

If the person is given a dime and is required to take away 4 pence, then that's equal to the dime, as the dime is 10 pence. So 10 pence - 4 pence = 6 pence. i.e. the person has 6 pence left after the process.\n3. Therefore, the option B: 10 pence has to be eliminated.\n4. If we do not consider the options 'all of the above', then the options left are C: 1 cent and D: 4 cents.\n5.

In this case, if the question asker is referring to mail, possible options are B:'synagogue', C:'bathroom', D:'front porch', E:'grocery store'.\n6. Synagogues don't typically receive mail but they do sometimes receive newspapers. However, this doesn't necessarily apply to the question asker, so it's not a necessary option.\n7. Similarly, bathrooms don't receive mail or newspapers in general. Front porches are an outside area but do not accept mail either.

Option B: bakeshop, C: kitchen supply store and Option D: grocery supply store.\n8. Since baskshop, kitchen store and grocery store won't be suitable, then Option A: kitchen is the most probable answer.\n10. However, a kitchen won't be able to store a lot of food items; hence, Bake shop which sells pastries would be a better option. From there, we need to understand what ovens are found there.\n11.

{"idx": 615, "text": "1. We start by understanding the context in the sentence. A tool has to be 'found' for the person to get it.\n2. So far, we know that the tool could not be found in the basement, the hardware store, a library, or the repair shop, as these places don't have them.\n3. We understand that the tool was probably 'found'.\n4. This helps to rule out D: repair shop and E: the library. The tool could have been found in either a hardware store or in the basement or the garage.\n5. Although the tool doesn't have to be located in the basement, it can certainly be located there if it's in the home. Hence, we cross out this option A: hardware store, B: basement, and E: the library as they don't make much sense in the context of the question\n6. At this point, there are only two options left: C: garage, and D: repair shop. \n7. This indicates that if the tool was found, the person needs to move down another floor or level to reach it, either by walking downstairs in a building or by moving to another location (another floor or level of another building).\n8. This is because there are no options that are levels below the one where the tool 'found'. Therefore, the options can be eliminated, leaving us with the correct option- 'garage'\nSo the final answer 100% correct answer is C: garage\n\nInput: Which of these does not come from a fruit?

{"idx": 623, "text": "1: The reasoning required to solve this question requires an understanding of the behavior of lizards.\n2. We will first eliminate irrelevant options:\n3. Lizards can't live on books, so they cannot live on them. Their habitat must include a source of heat, and they can't get their body temperature regulated by a dessert environment. Heat lamps are not a common lizard habitat either. Thus, E: rocks and D: heat lamps can be eliminated.\n4. Lizards can have body temperatures as high as 50C / 122F, about normal body temperature. Therefore, lizards require a more steady source of heat to thermoregulate than a heat lamp can provide.\n5. Lizards also eat insects such as bees, spiders and grasshoppers.\n6. Lizards can regulate their body temperature by basking in the sun: laying still with their belly facing the sun.\n7. Therefore the answer is C: bushes. Lots of lizards spend time during the day basking in the warm sun on bushes to regulate their body heat. This is a common behavior of a large number of lizards. As such, bushes provide a great location from which a lizard can derive its body heat from the sun.\nSo the final reponse is C: bushes\n\n\n---\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nAlthough we have taken every precaution to ensure the accuracy of our solutions, we are not responsible if the question is outdated or incorrect in any way.

Someone could also say that a shadow can appear on an entire building or on the ground, but in that case, it would actually apply to more than one choice, so the question could be viewed as a trap, with all the choices valid. The fact that they are opposed to the light is more of a general fact rather than a limiting factor. That's why it is easier to eliminate some answers than others.\n4) The correct answer would be \"ground\".\nSo the final answer has to be B: ground\n\nInput: Where are you expected to pay for your lunch?

Moreover, 'work in the french government' does not make contextual sense as the French Government does not usually employ exotic animals, which is more the territory of zoos and circuses.\n4. The answer is most likely to be a job involving close proximity to or handling exotic animals, since the monkey is surrendering.\n5. 'work in zoo' could be the appropriate answer, but we consider all the options to be equally possible candidates and we eliminate this as a contender.\n6. Out of the remaining options, D: south africa and E: madagascar, \"work in\" usually refers to a job one works in rather than works as.\n7. Moreover, \"work in south africa\" and \"work in madagascar\" imply employment in particular places, which is unlikely given the idiom is being used to refer to behavior or an action. \n8.

{"idx": 647, "text": "1) The question asks us to pick out the correct excuse used to justify ignorance in the context of criminal behavior. 2. There are two main types of ignorance that arise in cases of crime.\nFirst, there can be a general lack of awareness about the crime itself. This could be the result of limited access to information and education or a lack of attention to the situation.\nSecond, there can be a lack of awareness that a particular action has been deemed criminal. For example, someone might not be aware that their actions are in violation of the law.\n3. In some cases, 'ignorance' or rather 'ignorance of the law' (as it were) can be used as a legal excuse to justify certain criminal behavior. This is possible when the person was not aware that their behavior was against the law and had no intention of committing a crime. In such instances, the person could be exonerated from punishment.\n4. Let's look through the answers to figure out which one applies to excusing ignorance: A: learn about subject. This is not relevant to this specific question.\nB: learn new. This can also be an indication of ignorance, but it doesn't quite work in terms of excusing criminal behavior.\nC: find truth. This option specifically mentions searching for the truth, which can be a form of justification regarding knowledge gained, but it does not directly relate to criminal behavior and ignorance.\nD: is bliss.

Option C might seem like a plausible outcome, but it's irrelevant to the context of people in cars, therefore it can also be eliminated along with option E.\n6.

Option B: water is not a liquid meal, nor could one add salt and/or peppers to it to improve its taste.\n3. Option C: cellars are more likely to be places where fine wines are stored rather than salt and/or pepperd.\n4. Option E: grocery stores do sell meals, but their selection of meals, generally, is a bit more limited than those available in supermarkets, so grocery stores would not be a good option here either.\n5. This leaves us with two options: A: supermarket and D: soup.\n6. While one might add salt and pepper to liquid soup one-self, in the context of this question, we must determine if 'liquid meal' and'soup' are the same thing.\n7. Usually, the term'meal' implies the connotation of'meal served'. This is not the same as'soup', which implies'something liquid in its preparation'. Therefore, the answer has to A: supermarket.\n8.

This option could be possible, but it doesn't really work here. The phrase \"to love a place\" implies that the person loves the place, not that they're planning to spend a lot of money in that place.\n5) Option C: move there. This is another possible possibility however, does not make sense as a phrase that refers to a person's vacationing plans.\n6) Option D: stay longer. this also doesn't make sense and can be ruled out immediately. Staying longer would be a plan, not an effect of feeling a love for a place.\n7) Therefore, the best answer is E: debt.

In fact, some of their migration takes place partly in fresh water. However, while it is possible that the shark found in the television show was a basking sharks, biologists do not generally associate basking sharks with fresh water areas.\n\n5. Therefore, choice C: open ocean are the most likely answer. In North America, open water is where basking sharks are most commonly found, based on data collected from surveys and sighting reports. \n\n6. The question does not mention if the shark was a young or old individual, hence 'individual' is an answer choice that is not likely to get disqualified.\n\n7.

We are left with A: Run, B: row, C: turn away.\n5. Option A: Run describes the act of running/walking while using water transportation, which isn't human powered.\n6. Option B: Row, is an action verb describing what the person is doing. While doing it, the person does not need to sleep, as the action is being performed, so we can eliminate this option too. Now option C: turn away, is the only remaining option.\n7 \"Row boat\" can be removed from the statement as it can refer to both motorized and non-motorized water transportation, not just non-motorized ones.\n8.

So the options have to relate to why the company might want to sell more shares and generate more money.   \n 1. A: revealing information\n  2. The company might want to go public as a way of revealing information to the public and the investment community. This has to do with the company's business activities and its current situation.\n 3.

Choices: \tA: George Washington B: Abraham Lincoln C: Andy Jackson D: James Madison E: Thomas Jefferson\nOutput: The question refers to who America's 4th president was, and it is important to read the entire question carefully before trying to solve it.\n1. The options do NOT refer to who the first 4th president was.\n2. In order to eliminate, we first need to look at whether the option is referring to an individual or an office:\n     * Individual: George Washington was the first president, not the 4th. Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president, not the 7th (4th president is James Madison). Andy Jackson was the 7th president, not the fourth.\n     * Office: James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe each held the position of president more than once. James Madison was in the office of president from 1809 to 1817 and again from 1817 to 1829. Thomas Jefferson was the president during the years 1801 to 1809. James Monroe was in the office from 1816 to 1825.\n3. Therefore, the only option which matches both requirements mentioned above is D: James Madison (President 1789 \u2013 1797 | 1809\u20131817)\nSo the final answer to this question is D: James Madision.\n\nInput: Why do you need to bring me back my credit card?

However, this option doesn't make sense as it refers to medication that could be used to cure infections, but in this case, the person is asking where to go to purchase deodorant instead of getting rid of sweat or odor.\n3) For the option, B: medicine chest, this option is unlikely as a medicine chest is used to store medicine, not deodorant.\n4) The option, C: armpits, this is not the place to go to purchase more deodorant.\n5) The option, D: grocery stores, grocery stores usually sell more than deodorants. The person going through the grocery stores looking for deodorant would take a long time. This is more of a shopping place than where to go to buy some deo.\n6) Option, E: kitchen, this option doesn' do not make sense either as the kitchen is likely to be a place where food is cooked, and not where to look for deodorants.\n7) Therefore, option, B: medicine cupboard, is the most likely choice.\n8) People go to medicine cupboards for various medications; one of those medications is deodorant.\n9) That's why, option B: medicine cabinet, is the most likely answer.\nSo the overall answer is B: medicine cabinet.", "answer": "D: grocery store"}

Choices: A: pancakes B: milk C: money D: carrots E: a hug\nOutput: First, we need to understand why Dale the farmer is motivated by an exchange involving a reward. It is not to meet practical needs of providing milk, or making pancakes, but rather to obtain an intangible reward. \n1. 'pancakes','milk','money' and 'carrots' can all be given to Dale by an individual or another party, and thus are not valuable motivation for him to offer a goat-milking service.\n2. 'A hug' is an intangible asset which Dale would most likely be willing to provide after receiving his reward, but there is no question as to his readiness to offer goat-milking. 3. Dale is motivated by an intangible reward, so there is no possible reward which would motivate him to goat-milking in the absence of the desired reward. 4. Therefore, choice E: 'a hug' makes most sense as the answer. 5. Dale would be willing to let people milk goats in order to offer his reward.", "answer": "B: wedding party"}

So the question can be rephrased to indicate that we are looking for the name of KFC.\n4) Now that we understand the question in terms of the name of KFC, we can eliminate some choices, starting by disregarding \"bowl\" and \"freezer\", which refer to dishes or appliances that are not related to the question of the name.\n5) We also eliminate \"plate\" because it does not give us the answer as to what KFC is. \"Plate\" also implies that KFC does not serve chicken, and there are other options that have already been eliminated. So, \"plate\" can be eliminated from the list.\n6) Then, we have the choice of \"chicken\", which is actually the answer to the question, and \"oven\", which would need to be the name of somebody instead of KFC.\n7) So, the correct answer to the question is \"chicken\".\nSo the final answer to the question \"What is KFC?\" is \"chicken\".", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

Therefore, the options for what the family may receive are A: receiving some benefits, B: paying for your own funeral, C: receiving money that should instead be transferred to someone else, and D: losing all your possesions.\n2: Option A: receiving some benefits is possible, but is rare unless the deceased left some life insurance and the family of the decease has an intestacy order from the court.\n2: Option B: paying for the funeral is possible, but usually the funeral is paid for out of the estate, or the deceasen person will have made arrangements for the funeral in advance.\n2: Therefore, A and B are eliminated as options.

There is no indication that this leave-time is related to closing time, so they can be eliminated. \n4) This is consistent with the wording of the question, \"What was happening in the movie theatre?\" which suggests that the leave-time is not related to closing time, which makes sense, since closing time would have already happened. \n5) So the answer is First, in the movie Theatre. This is related to leave-tim", "answer": "E: wave on"}

So they both need to be one person. This immediately eliminates \"coworkers\", \"family members\", and \"children\".\n4.2) \"girl\" could be another word for \"daughter\" or \"woman\", which is not necessarily a family member. But we can't say they are, yet, so we eliminate \"family\".\n4.3) Finally, since we have come to a conclusion that the relationship is not a family member, we can eliminate \"brother\" as well.\n\n5.

Choices:  A. Moon B. Sun C. Earth D. Stars E. Jupiter\nOutput: The first question is a question of probability. Here the questions requires the person to evaluate the options based on the probability that the object is found in the sky. The following is a reasoning to the answer: 1. The Sun is unlikely to be in the Sky at the nighttime because the Sun is too bright for the naked eye to see at nighttime. 2. Stars are quite unlikely to be found in the nighttime Sky because by definition they are not visible. Jupiter, although it is visible to the naked eye may appear to reside in the nighttime Sky but is not really visible in the Sky because, while Jupiter is in the daytime sky during the daytime, it is in the nighttime sky at nighttime.\n3. Earth is likely to be in the Sky because the vast majority of its surface is visible in the Sky  during the daytime but there is a small part that is not visible on both ends of Earth, which makes Earth unlikely to be in the 'Sky'. 4. Moon is likely to be in Sky because it is most visible in Sky during the nighttime. 5. The Sun is the least likely to occur in Sky. Jupiter is the second least likely to be there.\nSo the final correct answer is A. Sun.\n\nInput: What might an avid runner notice first if they were on the right side of an intersection  Choices:  A) The oncoming", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}

Even though 'experiencing pain' is a possible outcome of playing football, the context of the question is about the feeling after a game.\n4. Option C: death could refer to the'moment of death' experienced when the player is injured, which is different from the feeling of enjoyment.\n5.

This means that the job itself must be secure or stable. \n4) Time can also be required to make a degree good. Good degree/qualification requires 4 years of study.

{"idx": 951, "text": "Reason:\n1. The question can be rephrased as: \"He finally found someone as uglier (sic) as him, knowing he would never be the one sticking (sic) out.\" \n2. The second clause, 'knowing he would never be the uglier (s) person sticking out' indicates the context is not about someone's attractiveness being considered a positive trait. \n3. 'Ugly' here refers to someone who physically is unattractive. \n4. Therefore, he knows he would not be the uglier person out of his situation as compared with other people. He knows he would only be out with ugliness when the others would be out with beauty.\n5. This suggests the man is aware of his ugliness but is also aware of the fact that beauty is more accepted in society than ugliness. This may be because he knows he cannot change his ugliness, which could make him feel insecure and unhappy, which could also be the reason for him finding someone else ugly.\n6. In this way, we see his situation is not about him being 'ugly' per se, but rather about how he feels about his ugliness and how he thinks about it in relation to others.\n7. However, his insecurity could also lead him to think about it in terms of his perceived inability to get attention or be liked by others (which may lead to him avoiding the attention or seeking the approval).\n8. Overall, we can conclude that his situation has made him realize that his ugliness might prevent him from being the 'prettiest, pretty, or beautiful' person in the room, as he may feel it is less acceptable. \n9.

Choose one:  A: after B: on C: before D: in E: on a sign, F: in a sentence\nOutput: 1.: The words \"to\" and \"work\" occur together so a sentence should contain both the words in the question; the question also implies this context is where you'd \"often find the word to and the word work\".\n2. The word \"to\" is always before the word \"work\". It cannot come after \"work\", even though it is possible for a sentence to contain both words in that order. This option can be eliminated.\n3. The word \"to\", while normally an article, can be used as a conjunction and used anywhere within a sentence. This option can be ruled out.\n4. The word \"to work\" is used in sentences in various contexts. So, the option needs to be an indicator of specific time/place/context. This option can also be eliminated.\n5. Similarly, the word \"in\" as in \"in a sentence\" or \"in on a sign\" can be disregarded. This option can also rule out since \"to\" is not a preposition in this case.\n6. This means option F can be chosen as \"to\" is used after \"work\" in a sentence, though not in the way we'd expect due to its use as an article.\nSo the final option choice in the word \"to work\" in a sentence is F: on a sign\n\nInput: What is common when you see people use money?

He needed to go to his neighbors' house because it was dark and there were no street lights to guide him.\n3. Because his house is at some distance from the street, his neighbors have to be closer to the street.\n4. The other options - street, road, and house - do not provide us any more context, while the last option 'neighbors' does provide context and indicates the location and a reasonable purpose behind the old man walking where he did.\n5.

Choices:  I: checked II: fine III: clean IV: approved V: repaired VI: removed\nOutput: 1: Inspection of the house should be done.\n2: The dog woke up the neighborhood and barked for quite some time.\n3: Since animals bark in a variety of situations, it may not point directly to something wrong within the house, which is what house inspection is often about.\n4: Barking indicates either agitation or annoyance in dogs. To call barking a \"repair,\" there should be some kind of abnormal behavior, since barking is not unusual.\n5: To determine whether something has to be repaired requires some kind of evidence, or at least reason that something was wrong in the case of houses. Otherwise, it's simply stating a \"negative\" fact.\n6: To remove everything in the house implies an extreme situation, that the house is unsanitary or otherwise dangerous to live in. Since there isn't any direct evidence, one cannot assume removing all the furniture could be a \"fix,\" which is what inspection is.\n7: None of the other choices would have any bearing on inspection and therefor are outside the scope of \"fixes.\"\n8: Option II: fine implies it was already okay, but this doesn't fit with the premise of the question, which doesn't imply what any choice would be.\n9: Option III: clean is also not a \"fix\" per se.

The engineer will oversee the whole project, the stonemason will build the large totem pole, while the piano tuner will adjust it.\n2). Now let's cross out the false ones.\n3). 'C: Engineer', 'D: Stonemason' can be eliminated.\n4). Engineers oversee buildings and structures, not totem poles. Furthermore, how can the engineer 'build' the large totem pole when he is overseeing it, when there is no mention of him holding a hammer and saw to cut the wood? This gives us A: Carpenter.\n5). Piano tuners will never touch large totem poles, even with tweezers, as such poles are always much larger than pianos (which also can't be tuned by tweezers to begin).

Therefore lamp, which is unlikely to be a radio of any kind, can be eliminated.\n6. That leaves C and D, which could be a transistor or a submarine radio. However, 'to reach base' suggests a radio of a specific type and for a purpose, so a transistor or submarine radio will have to do the job.\n7.

{"idx": 987, "text": "1-2 Reasoning:\n  1. The phrase \"who wants to make more at the job but can't\" means they couldn't find other ways to earn more. In this context,'making money' means working to get a better job.\n3-6 Reasoning:\n3. 'Owning a house' is not what a person needs for this job upgrade, they're not concerned with this at the moment.\n4. 'Winning a lottery' could be a possibility but it's not typical or relevant for this particular scenario.\n5. 'Saving money' is not the job upgrade required since if the person could save more, they'd probably have a better job.\n6. 'Feeling safe' cannot be what a person needs to get a better job offer either, if a person wants to get a different job they're probably not concerned with how safe an environment they're in as they are about their pay or benefits.\n7-8 Reasoning:\n7. As the other answers have been eliminated, a better job can be considered what they need.\n8. There could be a number of things a person might consider when they want a better job apart from'saving money' or 'feeling safe' but the word play is that the person does not currently feel that they have a sufficient job to meet all their needs so 'better job' is the best answer.\n9-12 Reasoning:This leaves the options 'a: better job' and 'C: win lottery.'\n9. 'A: better job' is a more logical option out of the two remaining since both phrases refer to income but 'better job' refers to the quality of the job itself whereas 'win the lottery' refers to an unconventional method of generating money.\n10. Also, the question focuses on the idea of job upgrading and that is what 'Better job' refers to.\n11. Since the phrase only provides information on what is needed and doesn't refer to where they can find the better job, the phrase on its own can't be used to determine that 'better job' doesn't refer to the location of the job.\n12. Therefore, the better job is assumed to be one that can provide the income they require and there is no restriction as to where it can be found", "answer": "B: better job"}

D: suburbia 5. E: lake\nOutput: In nature, a stump is the remnants of a trunk after the leaves or branches have died. \n1. In a deciduous forest, the remains of a tree after leaves fall off and branches are cut off by woodpeckers or other animals and decay. The stump may still absorb moisture for its survival. \n2. In a residential community, such as a suburb, a stump that has fallen from an old tree could have been removed by the owner, or might still be there", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

'Construction site' is also out of the scope of passenger transport as you are not looking for a tool or object that is often found on a construction site.\n3. 'Shops', could mean anything from clothing to toolshops, and the object could simply be in someone's trunk or in the dashboard of his vehicle or somewhere similar. The location would depend on the use of the rod and the car or vehicle he may want to find it.\n4. 'Engine' could not refer to a rod so cannot be the answer.\n5. The final choice we are left with is Choice E: broken bone. Metal rods are not placed on or near a broken bone, therefore it is unlikely someone finds a metal rod in his preferred mode of transport.\n6. The question is asking where would you find a metal rcoder in your preferred mode of transportation. Metal rods are used for medical purposes mainly, and are usually found in medical treatment rooms rather than in a vehicle. However, a broken bone can result in a person being found in a vehicle.

The question percisely asks about what he could drink, not should he drink.\n2. The sequence of choices he made could be a signal towards the drink he chose during breakfast time. \n3. There are obviously different types of drinks. So we start eliminating option B: coffee, because there are other drinks to choose from.\n4. Next, we eliminate option D: getting drunk because he's not yet done with breakfast.\n5. Option A: coffee is eliminated since he could still choose coffee for a drink. \n6.

{"idx": 2, "text": "1.) As a rule, to understand the meaning of a phrase, one usually needs to look to the context to find contextually correct answers.\n2.) \"Where the people are\" can refer to many places, depending on the context.\n3.) If the question does not refer to the context, then we can use contextually related words to infer if the sentence were in the correct context for one of them to make sense.\n4.) In this case, we can look to the phrase's origin for a clue. \"Where the people are\", was a colloquial phrased originated within the 20th century in American English.\n5.) Hence, based on the origin of the phrase, we can guess this question is in the context of the USA during the 20thcentury.\n6.) This narrows down our possible location to either a city or a crowded area. \n7.) We can then eliminate options D: apartment and E: roadblock because they only make sense while traveling in a car but cannot be found in a city or a crowed area.\n8.) This leaves us with options A: race track and B: populated areas.\n9.) These two make more sense because racetracks typically have more people attending.\n10.) Therefore the answer is A: race track\nSo the final answer would be A: race track", "answer": "B: populated areas"}

Among all the options: radio shack, substation, cabinet, television, desk, none of them require the use of a cable system.\n3.) But, if we look more closely at the options, we can see that cabinet and desk are too large to be moved around easily, and therefore are not appropriate choices.\n4.) Substation, while it looks large in size, is not movable, so the same rule applies to it.  \n5.) We can eliminate option D, as a television needs a cable connection to work.\n6.) Similarly, radio shack is not in the right category either - it is a place to purchase and use home entertainment equipment, not a type of equipment.\n7.) The last remaining option, option C, is a type of entertainment equipment that does require a cable connection.\n8.) Therefore, the correct answer is C: cabinet.\nSo the final choice is C: cabinet\n\nInput: What could be found in a small trash can? Choices:  I. paper II. plastic III. glass IV. trash V. none\nOutput: Reason:\n1. The question asks about the contents of a small trash can, and not what container a small trash can could be put in.\n2. We can eliminate the options III and IV because they refer to what a small trash can can be put in.\n3. The other options are things that can be found in a small-sized trash bin.\n4. Therefore V is correct.\nSo the correct choice is V: none\n\nInput: A man can drive through to get to his home, but his house is not what? Choices: I. accessible II. visible III. visible\nOutput: Reason for correct answer: 1. The sentence makes sense only with a man and his house.\n2. The other alternatives don't make a lot of sense when the first two words are used.\n3. 'Accessible' could be a property of a place, but doesn't have to be if there is a specific context in mind.\n4. Similarly, 'visible' can only be used as a property of a man or place to mean that he/it is noticeable. \n5. This leaves us with I and III options.", "answer": "D: television"}

{"idx": 14, "text": "1: The question asks for the most effective solution or course of action for James to take if he wants to stop from dying. 2. To answer the question well, we first understand that 'cooling off' means he is getting colder, so his 'heat' is diminishing.\n3. Among our options, 'calm down' and'relaxation' are the most effective but would do nothing to address the loss of heat.\n4. 'Revenge', on the other hand, would bring about an opposite effect of 'cooling off', that is to warm up instead and would bring him closer to death.\n5. 'Expansion' literally means getting larger or more expansive in size. Since he is already cooling off, expansion would have no effect in changing his heat.\n6. Finally, 'loss of heat' and 'loss of warmth' are effectively synonyms, so it's unnecessary to elaborate on the meaning of the latter and it is easier to stick to the term 'loss of heat' throughout the rest of the problem. 7. Therefore, the only sensible option that would make sense is A: loss of heat.\nSo the final answers are A: loss of heat\n\nInput: You are playing golf at a local park, where are some places to practice?

'Fescue' is not usually an area where golf is played, there is no practice hole in or near a green area, and a sand trap is not a grass area.\n2) The remaining options are: a) rough, b) tee boxes, and c) greens. 3) 'Greens' refers to actual playing surfaces. The practice area can be a little green area nearby, however, 'greens' is not a common term for the practice area, and there is no obvious practice holes anywhere else. 4) Hence, it's most likely 'rough'.\nSo the final answer(s) is(are) Rough\n\nInput: You want to get ahead of all the traffic, you need to take the __?

'Hospital' and 'doctor's office' are both locations where people can contract illness but this question is about people not places\n3.)

'Elderly' is ruled out because an 'elderly person' cannot contract illness. Only people can.\n\n6.) 'C' is the correct answer. To contract illness refers to one person getting an infection from another person. This doesn't happen with animals unless it is a zoonotic disease meaning a disease that can be spread from animals to humans. A'sick person' can get well or continue to be sick, but the illness has to be from another person 'c'.\nSo the final answer will be C: sick person\n\nInput: Why might someone not like to ride a bike?

D: They do not like to ride with the flow of traffic.\n5. E: They dislike being wet.\nOutput:\n1. A: This is quite likely because biking, as an activity, can be dangerous. A person may also have fallen off a bike at some point which could cause them to have a fear of the past experience.\n2. D: This is most certainly going to be a factor. People do not like to ride a bicycle if they have no money.\n3. C and E: This statement does not really make sense. It is unlikely that a person would dislike being wet (like when riding on a wet road on a bike, for example) since it will likely lead to greater inconvenience. However, they may dislike riding when raining.\n4. B: The answer to this question is actually D but we can get there with a simpler question of why someone may not like to drive a car because of a fear of the past.

{"idx": 22, "text": "1.) Based on the question, there are specific entrances to the company building. This indicates that not all entrances are equal and one of them could be deemed better than the rest.\n2.) If a person wants to avoid using the 'back entrance,' they need to use an alternate one.\n3.) The'side entrance' and the 'anterior entrance' are probably not what the person wants to use as they sound non-descriptive and not preferable.\n4.) 'Current entrance' is definitely not the option which will help the person avoid the 'back entrance.'\n5.) The 'front entrance' is the opposite of the 'back entrance,' but does not provide specific information about a specific entrance.\n6.) Since information is not clearly available about the entrance that is best to use, it is safe to assume that the person does not know which of the entrances is preferable.\n7.) So, we can assume that the best choice will be'main entrance.' We can eliminate'side entrance,' 'current entrance,' and 'front entrance' and are left with'main entrance' and 'anterior entrance.' However, since we don't know the relative preference of the person, we can't say one option is better than the other.\n8.) Therefore, the best choice is'main entrance,' which is preferred over 'anterior entrance.'\nSo the final answer for this question is main entrance.\n\nInput: Do cats, dogs, coyotes howl at the moon?

It doesn't make sense to tell someone to park. \n3) It's also not the man's responsibility to make time for the boss, nor does he receive instructions from the boss. It makes no sense for a boss to tell his employee to receive instructions since it's the man's responsibility in the first place to follow the kingpin's orders. \n4) The kingpin doesn't give money to his employee in exchange to running errands for him.\n5) Finally, the only option that makes sense is E: leave work. This describes a specific instruction by the kingpin to the man, a task that needs to be carried out immediately.\nSo the final answers is A: leave work\n\nInput:How did the boy learn to swim without lessons?

Similar to'make breakfast', 'go hiking' doesn't make sense when cooking food is on the agenda.\n5.

Therefore, the only correct option would be related to making payments for purchases or using money.\n3. A: costly is probably not correct as the initial game itself may indeed have been free to download and play. Although one may have spent some money for the microtransactions, it would not be a captive act related to it.\n4. B: captive is eliminated because the child may have been enticed with a game and ended up spending money. 'Captive' could be the definition of the action the child's parents were performing after the purchase.\n5. Although C: contained or D: paying may be correct options, they don't make sense based on the context. 'Contained' could be correct as it describes what the child was purchasing, but 'containing' could be the process of captive spending.\n6. From the context, a correct answer option does not need to be related to the act of making purchases. Rather, it pertains to the aftermath of it, when the child's parents discovered their purchases were not for 'free' but'microtransactions'. We look for an option that pertains to catching or confiscating something or someone.\n7. Hence, the remaining options are E: caught and B: captive, but option B: captive has already been taken out. Option E: caught makes the most sense since it uses the phrase 'captive spending'.

From the details, a'seafood restaurant' would usually be located on or near a body of water like an ocean, bay, lake, or river as they are usually frequented by visitors who are looking for food in that area.\n2. This would most likely not be the case in New York City, especially as there is a lack of coastal cities in New York.\n3. Hence, the answer has to lie in either Boston or in other coastal cities.\n4. 'Boston' and 'Coastal cities' are both possible answers as they can both apply to the phrase 'coastal cities', except for coastal Boston which does exist.\n5. Therefore 'Boston' would be eliminated and an acceptable answer would be the Coastal cities.\nSo the final Answer is C: Coastal cities\n\nInput: You are about to do a math problem, what should you do next?

As'making larger' and'reduced her waist' are incompatible with each other (if reduced, then made larger would actually imply she had gone from smaller to larger), 'A: gain weight' is likely to be the correct answer.\nSo the answer is 'A: gain weight'. \n\nInput: It is in my best interests to get the answer to what?

We do not use \"getting\" the answer for what to go on vacation or what to purchase, so we eliminate both A and C.\n2. We do not use the word \"answer\" for anything other than how to get the money. \n3.

There are several ways to answer this question, from a general, objective perspective, to a specific and subjective perspective.\n\nWe will assume that the context is a music store, rather than a music shop, because if we were to assume that there was no context, then the store option could be included within the music shop option as it indicates both a music shop and a music store.\n\n3.) The answer can be objectively answered by knowing that a \"symphony\", which is a group of musicians, is a typical ensemble that would most certainly have someone playing the \"cello\" instrument. Since the answer is an affirmative \"yes\", B can be rejected immediately.\n\nThe answer can also be specifically answered by knowing that a typical symphony will include a person or persons playing the cello, or by knowing specifically (subjectively) that if we go to a music store and ask for any symphony in-store, there will be a cello player performing.\n\nThus, A is the only choice that provides both objective and subjective answers, and can be the correct answer, and the only response that makes sense in this instance. \n\nSo the final answer should be A: ocean\n\nInput: A person has been walking for a little while, they stopped at what?

However, \"hotel\" and \"grocery store\" are out of context, suggesting that the context is an event happening.\n\n3.

One could say it was a nightmare, but that is not what the question is looking for.\n3 It is not that hard to tell the dream from reality, since a dream is experienced during sleep whereas awake would be while being awake and cognizant.\n4 This is a question about a person dreaming, not someone else. The person had trouble distinguishing the dream from reality.\n5 A common misconception about dreams is that they are always pleasant and wonderful, but they can be scary or nightmarish too. Stanley described his dream, and the dream was much more horrifying than the reality, so it must have been a nightmare for him.  7 To summarize, the answer would be nightmare, since there is no other possible choice as the dream was much more disturbing than his reality.\nSo the final correct answer is C: nightmare.\n\nInput:When I have a bad cold, I don't feel like cooking a hot meal, I instead eat what?

As with the sunglasses' use, the glare, or bright shine, on the window could be interpreted in one of two ways: As a reflection, or as a natural phenomenon.\n2.) It could be from the sun, or it could be from incandescent/LED lighting, either way, it reflects light from the outside, and this can be used to protect one's eyes from that reflected light (especially in times like sunset or dawn).\n3.) This is the only way the choice could be interpreted. Reflection could be from both outdoors and indoors, but either way there is a glare.\n4.) This choice is the best option.

However, they are not fried dishes that one typically thinks of when they think of alcoholic beverages. Also, any of them cannot be served in a pub unless it's a pub primarily operating as a cafe or diner. Therefore, we can rule out all of the other options, except A: pub. \n4) Next, let's consider what type of place a pub really is. It is a bar in the UK and part of Australia and many countries and territories that sell alcoholic beverges. It's where people drink. While many bars have food as well, it's not considered a key component of their operations. Therefore, pubs can be ruled out. Also, the term \"pub\" is not commonly associated with beer in the US. \n5) Thus, the only logical choice left is A: plane. This is because beer and fried food are considered alcoholic beverdges as well as fast food.

The kite is too far from the spool so it needs to be threaded with additional string to be able to complete the swing. 6) However, if the kite isn't properly threaded, the string will not reach the spool and the kite will be lost. 7) This happens a lot with kids with string that runs out on the spool. 8) The only way to keep this from happening is to be careful in threading your kite. 9) If you aren't careful, there isn't enough string on the spout and the kite will go flying away. 10) It isn't always that simple though so it helps to have a tool on hand to aid the threading process. 11) This tool can take the form of a string winder, which helps to wind extra string onto a spool. 12) A string winder is usually made of two metal bands that go around the string to keep it in place while you wind it up into the spool holder. 13) The other end of the spool holder is threaded in the center and used to tie the string to. 14) Even though you may have plenty of string in your hobby shop, it may not be enough for you to be able to use your kite. 15) If you do not have a spool of string, it is best to get one before you are in need of one. 16) The best idea would be to go to a nearby hobby shop where you can buy one. 17) Once you get one, make sure that you remember to always thread it properly before going out to play so that your kite doesn't fly away like Sally's did!", "answer": "D: end of line"}

Rain may fall in a thunderstorm, but a thunderstorm does not have to be rainy. Moreover, the expression 'it is raining cats' is a metaphor for a particularly rainy day, and 'cats and dogs' is a synonym for large heavy droplets of rain.

Scott Fitzgerald wrote the following: \u201cThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\u201d\nFor this part of the test, you are presented with two hypotheses, or possibilities, and asked to evaluate a claim or conclusion about one or both hypotheses. You must evaluate the claim without regard to whether you believe the hypothesis to be true or false (although, if you can do so, you should also evaluate the claim without regard for your own beliefs about reality).\n \nIt is important to note the following: \n \n\u2022 The second paragraph of this passage, the first paragraph of this section, is a restatement of the passage above. You should not view this paragraph as additional information; the answer to each question is only one of the two options presented.\n \n\u2022 The statements below are numbered 1 through 6, which you should use for purposes of the questions below.\n \n\u2022 You will answer at least two questions; you will not need to answer all of the questions to have a valid answer; your answers will appear in any order.\n \nIf you want to start from the beginning, you can return to the previous", "answer": "D: math problem"}

Choices: A: color B: dress color C: colorless D: colored E: colorful\nOutput: Reason 1: The question is asking if the person is wearing clothes in colors or in colorless appearance. It is asked as a yes or no question.\n2. The phrase I've never seen means the person in black and white is seen or spotted only with black and blue.\n3. It indicates that that person is not always in such an appearance. It can be said as \"never in black and white\"\n4. There seems to be a difference in the statement. It means that the person is either only seen in a particular color, blue or black.\n5. The other color options are only in colors, and not blue or black so they don't make any sense.\n6. The question should be answered as the black or blue color that is seen.\n7. Choice E: colorful does not make sense as the person is wearing either black or blue or both.\n8.

Choices: \nA: the ocean has lots of fuel sources B: You have infinite possibilities to find fuel C: You can always walk D: You can always swim E: it's too costly\nOutput: Reason\nA: the ocean is quite a wide body of water; you won't run out of fuel before finding another fuel source.\nB: The ocean can sustain various marine lives, which can in turn serve as fuel once the marine lives are consumed.\nC: Once the oceanic beings die or if the fuel source is consumed, they can continue to be used as fuel by walking or swimming to the nearest land and consuming the fuel source.\nIn the absence of being able to walk or swim to a land, it will be easier if you can survive with fuel.\nD: Since the water density is higher than the oxygen density, the body of your body will be much heavier than the normal; to survive, it is necessary to convert the excess energy inside the body into water, and in the end you can use it to survive for a little longer.\nE: Since your body is very heavy and it's difficult to swim when compared to the normal situation; to survive, you will need to consume fuel and to survive for a longer period of time.\nSo the final answers are A: the ocean has lots \nof fuel sources B: You can always walk.\n\nInput: If people with the initials PYT are really something, what do they possess?

{"idx": 158, "text": "1.. The question relates to the conditions required for personal or self-guided study, where you are responsible for your own learning.\n2. To understand the question, it is important to distinguish this type of study from being formally instructed or taught by someone else. 'Patience', 'cooperation' and 'thought' would be important for learning of this kind, though'study' suggests a certain amount of formal study or education, typically by a teacher, but not something you control for yourself.\n3. While 'exposure' is a type of learning method, it is unlikely to be relevant in this context- unless exposed to ideas, concepts and knowledge, one couldn't learn independently. 'Exposure' may be more appropriate for a more formal learning setting.\n4. We can therefore eliminate the options, leaving B: patience, C: study and E: thought.\n5. 'Patience' is somewhat related to 'thought', though it is less targeted at thinking, planning or processing information.\n6. To some degree, patience is required for'studying'; it can take a lot of patience and perseverance to complete a more formal course of study.\n7. This leaves us with C: study and E; thought.\n8. This then comes down to understanding of the context and the meaning of the phrase 'personal development', which is usually concerned with the development of one's self, including emotional, psychological, spiritual, intellectual and social development.\n9. Learning is an important part of this whole process and there are many ways to learn, formal and informal.\n10. However, studying by means of attending a class or course suggests the involvement of a teacher or instructor.\n11. In this context, the question refers to self-directed learning and understanding.\n11. Therefore, the correct answer is learning which is based on thought, pondering and considering.\nSo the final answers are C; studying\n\nInput: What would be the best way for a man with limited education who worked at a supermarket to find a new job?

Choices:  a: The cucumbers  b: The onions  c: The tomatoes  d: Nothing\nOutput: 1: Let's understand what is given to us in more detail.\n2: The girl went into a store and asked for the refrigerator.\n3: Inside the refrigerator she would find the Onions and refrigerator. The tomatoes are not inside the refrigerators, so we can eliminate that option.\n4: Because nothing is on the refrigerator and she thought its cucumbers, this eliminates the option of not being inside it.\n5: Cucumbers are a vegetable and so cannot be in a refrigerator. So we eliminate c.\n6: She would be asked for onions if she asked for cucumbers and the person who sold the cucumbers would not have onions there. A is incorrect.\n7: Onions would be on the ground if she asked for them, and not in a refrigerated state, so D is incorrect.\n8: So the correct answer is b: Onions.\nSo the final choice is B: Onions\n\nInput:What might I use to keep my feet feeling cozy?

{"idx": 170, "text": "1.\"Christmas presents\" is a common expression referring to buying gifts for friends and family at Christmas time.\n2. The phrase \"Christmas presents\" could be construed to mean that people typically do buy gifts for their loved ones at Christmas time. Therefore, if there is a problem preventing one from buying gifts for others then one can't possibly buy what they really want at Christmas time.\n3. It doesn't make sense for a person who doesn't have any money to buy a \"Christmas present\", because they will not have sufficient funds to buy a gift for someone. \n4. If a person is struggling financially then they most likely won't be able to buy gifts for anyone at Christmas time. This rules out choice options B: lack of money.\n5. Similarly, a person may not always want a \"Christmas present\" to be given to them. \n6. Therefore, we eliminate choice options B: lack on money, C: stress, D: relief, and E: exhilaration since the phrase could be construed to reference a time when the person wouldn't want an extra gift.\n7. This leaves us with only one option that makes sense, A: happiness.\n8. We know that it's Christmas time, and if one is happier then they'll have a higher chance of being able to buy what they really want as a gift.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is A: happiness\nSo the final answer  is A: happiness\n\nInput: What are you likely to spend money on if you just go back to college? Choices: 1. A bicycle 2.

The first three choices (A, B, C) are all related to spending money and are thus excluded from further consideration.\n4. The last choice (D), is one of the most likely answers to the question, as the individual in question will likely spend money there to be able to pay for tuition.\n5. That leaves us with only one choice that makes logical sense, option B: Textbooks. So the final answer  is B: Textbooks\n\nInput: What do you need to prepare for a", "answer": "B: lack of money"}

Movie theaters would feature the ficus for decorative purpose, not indoors, making it unlikely. A hair salon does show a use of the ficus indoors, but it doesn't make the most sense in the context of the question, indicating that the plant is going indoors to live with someone.\n5. Hence, A: family room.\nSo the final choice is B: family room\n\nInput: How could a student improve the class? Choices: A: Be better at math B: Do better on their spelling test C: Work harder D: Get rid of the teacher E: Be nicer to others\nOutput: Reason 1. This question asks what a student can do to improve the classroom.\n2. When the student wants to improve the class, this implies improving the other people and objects in his classroom.\n3. 'Be nicer to others', which is an action towards improving another person, is not improving the class, as this does not improve the people or other things in the classroom, including the teacher. \n4. 'Be better at math' is not improving the entire classroom and so is not an option.\n5. 'Do better on the spelling test' is improving the student herself. \n6. 'Work harder' is an action to improve the student, but is not about improving the class.\n7.

E: side of road\nOutput: 1) 'Parking lot' and 'parking garage' are both places where people park their vehicles, however they also have other differences. Parking garages are typically enclosed buildings that contain many floors containing parking spots.\n2) Suburbia can refer to the state of being suburbia, but it can also refer to the actual suburbia, so this choice does not make much sense as the answer.\n3) Mall is a place often visited in suburbia.\n4) 'Side of road' and 'parking lot' have very different contexts and don't make much sense together \n5) 'Old man' and the other choices do not really make a lot of sense together \n6) 'Mall' is typically a place where people go to shop and dine.

As such, the answers for \"in england\" and \"on the wall\" are out of scope since the question does not refer to any such locations. \n5) The word \"on\" has a slightly different connotation than \"outdoors\" and suggests that, \"outdoors\" refers to the immediate surrounding area of the cabin in the woods. \n6) As such, it is reasonable to assume that the test-taker is being asked whether he saw the fox outside of the cabin or on the cabin\u2019s wall.\n7) Hence, the relevant options to consider are A: outside and B: around the cabin.\n8) Test-takers can eliminate the answer in option C: on the wall, because it's outside of the scope of the question.\n9) If the answer is D: around the cabin then the fox must have been outside of the cabin meaning that his sight of the fox must not be in the cabin or \"on the wall\".\n10) If the answer is E: picture, then the fox must not have been a real fox but a picture. Therefore, the possible answer is A: outside.\nSo the final choice is A: outside", "answer": "C: outside"}

'Being bored' and 'pondering' may be a possible reason for studying the exhibits, but 'being bored' is unlikely for someone willing to spend more time at the exhibition.\n4. 'Back pain' is not a reason that typically precedes time spent at the exhibition.\n5. 'Tired feet' is an unlikely scenario since he is likely to have planned his time in advance to avoid having to walk too far.\n6. After careful consideration, the likely reason is E: 'pondering' for the exhibits. This answer describes the personality of John, who is very academic and likes to gain knowledge. In addition, this option is the only one that refers to the museum and not walking around or being tired from it.\nSo the final choice is E: pondering", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}
{"idx": 214, "text": "1.) By process of elimination the most likely answer is either home/toy store/toy shop, as school does not sell board games, nor do people normally play board games there.\n2. Home is not a viable answer, as that would depend on whether or not the game was at the family's home.\n3. This leaves toy store and toy shop as the other options, as stores will sell and display the products they sell. \n4. Toy store is most likely. A toy store is where most board games are sold and would be where you might buy them if you wanted to start playing as a family.\n5. Toy shop is a store with toys, but it implies that it sells other types of toys, not primarily gaming toys, so it's less likely that a toy shop would sell board games.\nSo the final and correct answer is A: toy store\n\nInput: What's an issue that might arise when you cook? Choices:  Mistakes with recipes. Burning the food. Using different ingredients. Using the wrong stove. Not preparing enough.\nOutput: The answer would likely be D, but there could be some ambiguity. However, this is not an error. \"The wrong stove\" is obviously a noun, not a word, and the phrase is \"Using the wrong stove\". \nThere are no prepositions in the sentence, but sometimes there can be some misunderstanding when two words or groups of words appear before each other without grammatical connection (two prepositional phrases joined but no conjunction).

Tall trees can't have a cat's tail on them, cats aren't usually hanging around tall trees, nor do they frequent them, except potentially in zoos or sometimes in very tall backyards. 3.

{"idx": 218, "text": "1: First, we understand the question, which is asking under what circumstance the animal would get tired.\n2. The animal being referred to could either be a human, a domesticated pet or a wild animal.\n3. This eliminates the option D: need to eat as this is not likely to be relevant to a human. It also eliminates option E: go to sleep, as it is not relevant to a pet or domesticated animal.\n4. For option B: lie down, the animal would either have to be a domesticated one, or a sleeping one. This isn't enough information.\n5. For option A: bite, this could be applicable to domestic or human animals, and also to a wild animal, but the context doesn't state that.\n6. This would leave us with option C: keep alive. This refers to when a person is very tired after a long day or a long work session.\n7. An animal can do this.\n8.

Choices: 1. 1 time, the first. 2. 99 times, the first hundred. 3. a long time, the second. 4. 2 times, the second. 5. never, the second. \nOutput: 1) It is highly unlikely that any answer on the exam will include the word \"the first.\" We should definitely eliminate options 1 and 2.\n2) 99 times is an unreasonable and irrelevant number to be multiplied by a whole number like a hundred. The number also looks a bit clunky and may not make any sense to the average reader. This could be eliminated.\n3) \"a long time\" isn't something that is counted. \"First\" is still an unreasonable answer to be in this context.\n4) It's not even clear what number we're multiplying by \"second\". 2 is a perfectly viable number, so while this answer does technically work, it's just too ambiguous to be relevant.\n5) 5 times is not \"never the second\" because a single multiplication of 5 and any number will give you an answer of 5.

This word could work as a means to burn the wood or indicate the wood is too charred to have any of its features visible.\n3) 'Carved' and 'Competed' don't make sense either, as the wood would need to have something carved or competed on it to be able to see one's reflection.\n4) 'Nailed' can't work because of its contextual meaning. It's nailed to the wall and doesn't have anything on it.\n5) Hence, our list of options is narrowed to B: Polished and D: Nail.\n6) Polished has a different meaning and doesn't appear to be appropriate. So, the answer is D: Nail. It makes sense that nailing on something might cause one's reflection to appear clearly.\nSo the final response is D: the nail\n\nInput: What could you call someone who owns more than they could sell and then use? Choices:  (A): an excessive shopper (B): a saver (C): a borrower (D): a poor planner (E): a hoarder\nOutput: 1.) Eliminating options:\n2.) It makes sense that the answer is a hoarder, as shopping excessively wouldn't make anyone more likely to sell their possessions and make use of the money.\n3.) Furthermore, a borrower likely wouldn't pay attention to how much they own, as they would probably be paying attention to how much they still have to pay off.\n4.)

Option A : You're bored, would also fit as a direct answer, and it's correct as well.\n4. But the options that do not fit are option C: relax and option D: mentally challenging. The man was not doing crosswords to stress himself mentally, or to relax, and neither crosswords can be used to be stressing him mentally nor relaxing. \n5.

Choices: \n  A: the bill\n  B: the bartender\n  C: his friends\n  D: another round\n  E: the bar\nOutput: Reason the bar is the most likely place where Ben would want more of something:\n1. The question asks about something Ben would want more of at a typical bar.\n2. The bar itself is the most likely place to run into Ben, or his friends.\n3. When asked what one would want more of at the bar, the answer could be referring to the bar itself, the amount of alcohol served at the bar, or even the number of people drinking at the bar.\n4. Among these options, Ben would be more likely to want more people at the bar than he currently has at the bar. \n5.

A table, however, may not be where the scissors were last placed, so even if the scissors went to the table, they might also have been moved to another location before the speaker did.\n5)\"In your hand\" is the least likely answer. Scissors are more commonly kept on the table, as it makes them easier to reach.\n6)\"up the mountain\" is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer for this question is E: up the mountain\n\nInput: Did you catch thief in the act?

{"idx": 282, "text": "Reason:\n1. The sentence says \"It seemed like the guys there\" which refers to a group of people.\n2. The word \"like\" here indicates the speaker's preference for avoiding the situation.\n3. We can therefore assume that there must be some things the guys at the party did that Jimmy either did not find appealing or could not join.\n4. The question focuses on what the guys there were doing that Jimmy didn't like.\n5. Jimmy is not liking the whole party scene which excludes getting drunk, because the guys there, as implied by \"It seemed like\", can drink and get drunk at the party if they want to.\n\n6. Also, the phrase \"seeming like\" does not necessarily mean the guys got drunk.\n7. What they were doing could also indicate their presence at the party.\n\n8. Since Jimmy would not likely go to a party he did not like, it is more likely he would prefer the guys be having fun than sitting and doing nothing.\n9. So the correct answer would be D: \"having fun\".\n\nSo the final answer for this question is D: having fun\n\nInput: Which type of sandwich is not common in the USA? Choices:  The Submarine D: Grilled cheese sandwich E: Pastrami D: Ham sandwich\nOutput: 1) As stated in the question, a submarine (also called a sandwich sub) is a common type of sandwich in the US. The Grilled cheese sandwitch and the Pastrami sandwich are also common types of sandwiches that are found throughout the US. This may not be the whole list of sandwiches that can be found in the US but it can be said that the sandwiches above are common in the US.\n\n2) Considering that 'The Submarine' is a common sandwich in the US while 'The Grilled Cheese Sandwich' and 'The Pastrami Sandwich' can also be considered common sandwiches in the US, 'B' and 'C' seem to be the best answers. However, 'D' and 'E' can also not be eliminated as options. 'Grilled Cheese Sandwiches' can be commonly found as fast food and 'Ham Sandwich' is also an example of a common type of fast food.

{"idx": 286, "text": "1) What is a sign that you may not be living someday?\n2) To answer this question, we need to look at the options (choices):\n3) A) Growing older.\n4) Not everyone can grow old. Some people die at a very young age. Moreover, it's quite unlikely that the passage refers to old age as an early warning sign since old age is also a relatively natural part of life and many people go through it in a normal, healthy way.\n5) So, the answer is likely to be something other than growing older.\n6) B) Reproducing. This could be an indicator that a person may not live long or at all as one of their offspring may be a threat to life or well-being in the near future. Therefore, this could be a good choice to consider initially.\n7) However, this could simply be a normal, biological function. Moreover, some people never reproduce at all; yet still they live.\n8) Therefore, we'll continue our search for the answer.\n9) C) Shuddering. Shuddering could be a strong indication that there's something wrong with the body, which may be an early warning sign. The body, however, may be responding in that way because of some other cause, not necessarily because there's a reason to expect early demise.\n10) D) Perspiration. Although perspiration, and more so sweating, are common occurrences in everyday life, and can accompany stressful situations, they don't necessarily signal a threat to life. Hence, this can be eliminated as a strong possibility.\n11) E) Palpitations. Palpitations is a common and normal condition that can be indicative of a heart problem, but this doesn't necessarily mean it's a warning that a person's life is at risk.\n12) This leaves us with choice B: Reproducing.\n13) The person could have a child (option B), but the offspring could also kill them before their time (option D). The passage doesn't mention which is more likely to happen, so the person might live out their natural life.\n13) Thus, the answer is option B: reproducing is a sign that you should not be living soon.\nSo the final choice is B: Reprodu", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

{"idx": 294, "text": "The options are as follows:\n1. It's not possible to take a ride on a roller coaster, or anything similar, in a car, so Car is not an option.\n2. Option A: farm is more likely to be a part of country or rural residential areas, so the context would likely be somewhere else.\n3. Option E: \"urban area\", while it is possible to find roller-coaster rides within an urban environment, its association with the word \"parking lot\", which is typically present in suburban and residential areas, means it can be ruled out.\n4. Option A: \"farm\", which is a rural establishment, could conceivably also be a residence of a roller coaster proprietor, but its lack of geographical placement or clarity in terms of specific location indicates that it is also not an option.\n5. This leaves us with Options B: business district, C: carnival, and D: zoo.\n6. Option B: Business district is likely to be more focused on work and commerce, rather than recreation. The word \"near\" would indicate that the context is likely residential-affiliated, so we eliminate this choice.\n7. Option C: Carnival. This is a large gathering of travelling entertainers that may come into town, and if we take the \"car\" mentioned in the question as a mode of transportation, it would only apply if the car was the mode of transportation to the carnival. \n8. With that in mind, the carnival itself would not be any nearer in terms of proximity within the question, since the term of \"using a parking lot near\" refers to the context of using the car to access the carnival, not actually being at the carnival. We can eliminate this choice as well.\n9. That leaves us with option D: \"zoo\", which is a large attraction and carries the same connotation as the carnival, however the proximity in relation to the car is not relevant in the context. \n10.

Option C: Weapon - This answer choice can't be ruled out, but it is insufficient because it doesn't contain additional information that helps eliminate other answer choices.\n4.

{"idx": 302, "text": "1: Let's first eliminate D: early riser. It's unlikely for an early riser to be a night owl.\n2. Second, we can eliminate C: lark. It's unlikely a lark who wakes up early to sing at dawn, would be a night owl who prefers to go to sleep only later into the night. This would be self-contradictory.\n3. That leaves A: morning person and B: early bird. From the context, there is no indication of the person being morning person or an early bird.\n4. The question uses the terms night owl and sunrise interchangeably, with other options being morning person and sunset. \n5. Furthermore, the question also alludes to a night owl being what you'd head or hear at sunset and a what you'd hear at sunrise. If a night person is someone who goes out at night, you can't say they are what is heard at sunset/sunrise nor that you'd head them. Hence, the answer must be morning person at sunset and sunrise\n6. We can eliminate D: rooster. The night owl would be what you'd head in darkness, when you can't see the rooster, which is likely at night, and you can't hear the rooster. \n7. Therefore, B: early bird is an incorrect answer.\n8. For the final answer, consider these factors:\n9. The night owl, would be someone who stays awake late, which leads to a head being called out to. \n10. Early bird, also known as morning person, is a kind of waker upper, who arises in the early morning.\n11. Therefore, a morning person, who wakes up early is what is being called out at sunrise.\nSo the final answers are A: morning person and sunrise and C: night owl and sunset\n\nInput:When you want privacy, what can you use as a blanket to wrap around the bed?

As such, when it comes to fairy tales, there is no guarantee that the small knight has to be found in a fairy tale.\n3. This narrows out the choices to either the castle or the chess board. \n4) A castle would be a fitting home for a small knight but the word castle refers to a building that belongs to the king, so a person could probably find any size of knight there.\n5. A chess board, though, is more likely to be the location, since chess originated in medieval times and knights are often depicted in chess pieces.\n6) Therefore, the answer is C: medieval times.\nSo the final result is C: medieval times\n\n## 5959499370934\nInput: Who was the first to be in touch in New York?

Stress is definitely not what the question is asking.\n2. No two people are going to compete with a debate.\n3. An argument is something that happens between two people but this doesn't refer to the reasons they may compete.\n4. The word \"tension\" could be associated with fighting but that isn't always the case.\n5. The only relevant option here that could possibly work is \"winning or losing\" because if two people are competing then this would definitely be part of it if there were any fighting over it. \n6. This is because if they win then they will have achieved something that makes them feel confident about themselves but if they lose then there could potentially be tension over who won and who lost since feelings may have been hurt in that process.\n7. \"Winning or losing\" is the most likely option to be correct even if it is not technically the correct answer.\nSo the correct answer is C: argument\n\nInput: Where are most birds found? Choices: 1. A: on the ground. 2. B: in trees. 3. C: In forests. 4. D: In meadows. 5. E: In cities.\nOutput: There are a lot of different types of birds. To be sure, most birds don't fly high up in the sky. Instead, they tend to find places to nest that are close to sources of food, such as nearby trees or forests. This doesn't necessarily mean they would be found in a big city or town, because it would be too dangerous for them there.\nBirds do like to live close to lots of water, like lakes and ponds. Meadows may have some little water sources that wouldn't make for great nesting sites for most types of birds. But where do birds nest? The answer has a lot to do with whether a bird is native to an area or an introduced species. Natives live off the land where they were born, like native birds living in Europe in Europe. Introduced birds are ones brought into a new habitat from another place, like a few birds such as the house sparrow introduced to South America by humans long ago.\n\n## Part III", "answer": "C: argument"}

This describes someone who is not very familiar with someone else.\nSo the final choice: D: Unacquairanted\n### For reference, follow the video and the PDF for the correct answers:\nFor the video follow this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09yW7qg3zSs\n\nFor the PDF follow this link: https:https://www.getsetpractice.com/files/question-bank/practice-test-7/test-questions-practice-test7", "answer": "A: cold"}
{"idx": 354, "text": "Reason:\n1. There are typically three things to the question, a person, a characteristic, and a contrasting adjective.\n2. We begin by eliminating the contrasting adjective as options which is diet. There is no need for the person to be diet.\n3. Next, we eliminate the option that is an antonym of the given adjective, i.e. slender as it does not contrast thick.\n4. We then check the antonym of sparse as sparse means having many small holes or gaps and since we have already eliminated slender, thick doesn't contrast slender either.\n5. Then we eliminate the other options. Since the contrasting adjective is free-flowing and we already know slender has been eliminated, unacquainted does not fit the bill.\n6. Since the contrasting noun is person, the right answer is C: sparse.\nSo the final choice is C: sparse\n\nInput: How does one know the dog is no longer a puppy? Choices:  I. It starts barking loudly A. True B. Wrong\nII. It grows fur more quickly C. True D. Wrong\nIII. It takes on a new appearance B. True C. Wrong D. True\nOutput:\n1. Since the question poses a comparison between two conditions, a right answer (B) has to be an event, action, or process that shows the comparison between the given conditions, is a new process in itself, and is observable.\n2. So, let\u00b4s see what we can infer. We can eliminate the wrong options. They are not new processes so we can discard them. For options A and C, barking loudly and rapidly growth of hair isn't new processes, so we can discard these options too.\n3. Thus the only possible choice is III. Which is a third stage in development or changes that happens to dogs. It means when a dog grows up, it takes on a new appearance, so when a dog grows from a puppy to an adult, we can say that the dog takes on a new appearance. Hence, the answer is D. True.\nSo the final right answer is option D.\n\nInput: If I go to college, it may involve working and being in class, are they doing this? Choices: 1. They\u2019re", "answer": "A: slender"}
{"idx": 358, "text": "1st option - Reasoning:\n2. 'A: jigsaw puzzles' would not be a correct response as it would not be only one \"piece\".\n3. 'B: Chess Game' would also not be a correct response since it is made up of two pieces - 'the chess board' with the pieces on it.\n4. 'A: puzzle box' is a type of box in which a puzzle may fit; however, it would not be correct to say that a puzzle could be made out of only one of these boxes.\n5. Hence, only one option left that could be correct answer is 'E: Chess Piece'\n6. 'Chess Piece' is a single piece, so the only option that follows from reasoning to be the answer would be 'E: Chess piece'\nSo the final answer should be E: Chess Piece", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}
{"idx": 362, "text": "1: This is a tricky question as the answer to it is not the most predictable conclusion.\n2: We start by eliminating non-logical options: 'jail time', 'fear', and 'going to prison' are not emotional repercussions of murder and are thus eliminated.\n3. A: The question asks us which emotional consequence would happen to the person's conscience if they were caught murdering someone. The logical answer is 'feeling' as it is the one possible emotional aspect that could happen.\n4. We can conclude that this aspect of the question is asking which emotion they will feel, which implies that no other emotions will be elicited in the person's conscience after they are caught red-handed for the murder.\n5. Hence, option 'D: nothing' is the correct answer to the question.\nSo the final choice is: D: nothing\n\nInput: How does an adverb typically modify the verb? Choices: 1: A: in a sentence B: in a story C: with the sentence D: after the sentence E: before the sentence\nOutput: 1 Reasoning: An adverb is a word that modifies a verb in a sentence and changes its meaning as in: \"He ran very quickly.\" As this example shows, an adverb would modify the verb, i.e. 'ran'.\n2 Reasoning: Some options are irrelevant: An adverb cannot usually modify a story, so B is out. A, C, and D refer to sentences; however, adverbs often precede or follow a verb. For example, they can be placed at the beginning (The door fell fast from her grip) or end (They will only take a few minutes to prepare.)\n3 Reasoning: C is out again. If an adverb could modify a sentence, it is unlikely it would follow the sentence. Adverbs are most commonly placed before sentence verbs.\n4 Reasoning: The answer is C. The adverb usually modifies the main verb at the beginning of the sentence.\nSo the final option to choose from is: C: before the sentence\n\nInput: While there, I met my ex-girlfriend's friend, I called out to her to introduce myself. she told me that she was with her sister's sister's son and not on her friend, what happened", "answer": "E: feeling of guilt"}
{"idx": 366, "text": "Reason:\n1. Given the context of the question, we can assume that the word \u201cbe\u201d in \u201cperceive someone they are scare of\u201d refers not only to the actual physical act of seeing, but to the interpretation or analysis of the things people witness. \n2. That leads us to consider the possibility that the reason why they could be \"scared\" of a person is because they perceive them to be dangerous.\n3. \u201cDaily Vocabulary\u201d doesn\u2019t help us a lot with this because the word \"scary\" is used there in the sense of a word to describe something that you might experience when you get older, instead of \"scared\", which is used in a context of fear and anxiety experienced by a child.\n4. In the question about how people perceive \u201csomeone they are scared of\u201d, we can conclude that the word \u201cscared\u201d refers to fear and anxiety experienced when being terrified.\n6. We can then eliminate option (A), \u201cHuman\u201d, because it makes no sense in the given context. 7. The fact that the person is scared does not seem to have anything to do with the person being human or the person\u2019s species. 8. Therefore, this leaves options (C), D and E. \n9. Since we know this is about how people perceive someone they consider or feel to be dangerous, we can discard option (D). If people are feeling \u201cun-easy\u201d about that person they are scared of, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see this person as a \u201chappy\u201d person, wouldn\u2019t they?, since they are scared he is dangerous, which doesn\u2019t correspond with the \u201chappy\u201d part they could be feeling. \n10. We can also discard option (E), \u201cweird\u201d. Although the word \u201cweird\u201d can mean strange or unusual, it also can mean that the person is behaving strangely or weirdly so, as far as it seems in the context of the question being discussed, it also doesn\u2019t make sense. \n11. So the last choice left is (C) \u201cdangerous\u201d, because this makes more sense in the given context and since we can\u2019t pick two or more, we conclude that this is the only acceptable answer for the question.\n\n### Instruction:There are eight clues and", "answer": "C: dangerous"}

B: Because dogs don\u2019t use any kind of writing tools. 3. C: Because dogs don\u2019 think of things in this kind of general way. 4. D: Because we don\u2019t know much about pens and pencils. 5. E: Because people don\u2019t use their paws to write by.\nOutput: 1) If you were to ask someone, \"Do dogs use pencils?\" the natural response might be \"No, dogs do not use pencils.\" \n2) However, if you said, \"Do dogs use writing tools?\" the reasonable response might be \"Yes, dogs use writing tools.\"\n3) This means the option \"It\u2019s not true\" is not correct.\n4) A dog would have to \"know about pens\" to be able to say \"no\" to \"dogs don\u2019t use pens.\" In other words, the option C \"because dogs don\u2019t think of things....\" is incorrect.\n5) It doesn't make sense for dogs to \"use paws\" for writing.

{"idx": 374, "text": "1. This question can be answered if one understands common dictation practices.\n2.  We first eliminate options that don't make sense: A: Library. It makes more sense to refer to a dictionary for academic purposes while in the library. Instead, we can refer to a dictionary when we're in a study area, whether it's a study area in a room or a study area in a library. B: Classroom. It makes more sense for students to use a dictionary to look up words than to refer to it while in class. Instead, we can use a dictionary when we've completed a class. E: Shelf. It makes more sense that a dictionary stays on a shelf than to refer to it when using it.\n3.  This leaves us with A: study area. We now examine what study areas can be for specific types of dictation purposes. For instance, if this refers to a study area for academic purposes, it makes sense to refer to a library dictionary as opposed to a classroom dictionary.\n\nSo the final answer, A: study area\n\nInput: The bride wore a blue veil like the one her grandmother had worn on her wedding day, and made her own bouquet Choices:  A. In lieu of B. In place of C. In comparison of D. In place with E. In contrast with\nOutput:\n1) The phrase \"like her grandmother had\" refers to copying the grandmother's action of wearing a blue veil. The phrase \"made her own bouquet\" refers to copying the action of making a bouquet. Therefore, all the options are accurate, but the question asks about the relation of the two clauses, which makes comparison the most appropriate choice.\n2) The second answer choice is incorrect. The phrase \"In lieu of or In place of\" typically refers to substitution whereas comparison is an apples to apples comparison of two things. \n3) Similarly, In comparison of is incorrect, as the given phrase is in comparison not in comparison.

{"idx": 378, "text": "1 Reasoning based on the context:\n2. When two parties fight, each fighter's goal is to defeat the other, unless they find themselves in a losing position.\n3. Arrogating and retaining refer to keeping or gaining something or someone.\n4. When two people fight, they are both looking to defeat the other. Neither can afford to allow the other to retain anything.\n5. Engage and embrace both refer to taking somebody as your own.\n6. If Bill does not abandon the fight, which option would make sense? Arrogate and retain mean the same thing, and embrace and engage refer to taking on to one's self.\n7.

{"idx": 382, "text": "1-3) The options are all places where one might find people gathered near water.\n4) But the people gathered at the water cooler don't seem to be having much fun. Moreover, the people gathered at the beach are probably not at the workplace.\n5) But the people gathered around the water cooler are probably having as much fun as the people gathered at the hockey game.\n6) Hence, option B: opera can be eliminated.\n7) The reason is that the group at the hospital is not gathered near liquid, while the group at the beach is not gathered near water. Both group's are, however, gathered in a workplace.\n8) Option D: hockey game fits better since the group at the theatre should be gathered by the liquid there, while the group at beach can be eliminated since they are not gathered near the water there.\n\n9) As a result, if the question asked, where could you find people gathered in a workplace? The option C: opera and F: water cooler would be reasonable answers.\n\n\n\nInput: Where would you find people gathered at a workplace in the evenings? Choices:  C: opera D: water cooler E: hockey game A: beach F: workplace\nOutput: Considering all the options, we can eliminate F: workplace option from our list immediately. Option A: beach is not a place where people would gather at a workplace in evenings, nor can it be the place where other options would be gathered. Hence A: beach can be dropped from the list.\nFrom the remaining options, a rational deduction may be made as follow:\n1. People gather at workplaces to have fun, and options C: opera, D: water cooler, and E: hockey game are all workplaces in that sense.\n2. As seen from previous question, people gathering near water are not having fun, so option D: water cooler can be eliminated from the list.\n2. People gather near the workplace at night are more likely to do so at the workplace itself, and one place they would gather at a workplaces at night is the beach, which is a common gathering near water place.\n3. Hence, the only reasonable options are C: opera and E: hockey game.\n5. Thus, the most appropriate option in this question is E: hockey game. A", "answer": "A: water cooler"}
{"idx": 386, "text": "1) The question asks where one might find a fox hunting, but that doesn't apply to the fox that is doing the hunting. Rather, the context is the setting of where a person is hunting, and in this case, the fox hunting is a term that refers to the chase.\n2) Although foxes are often found in forests, they do not exclusively live there and therefore can appear elsewhere to carry out their typical behavior.\n3) We will not find a fox hunting in an arctic tundra as foxes are usually found in temperate forests.\n4) The Great Outdoors is an idiomatic expression, more akin to what one might find one at a lake or on a vacation as the term suggests.\n5) The term 'beach' does not appear to match the context. It would be reasonable for a fox to be hunting on the beach but this doesn't necessarily seem to be the case here.\n6) This leaves us with E: England. Given that the question specifically asks for a fox that is hunting by way of their typical hunting behavior, what better place in the world for that to occur than in England?\nSo the final answer would be England\n\nInput: If a lion is in the jungle, where else can it go?

We can then also eliminate B: Dog show from being a joke about dogs being eaten because a Dog show is not a cuisine.\n2nd step: It is likely that B: backpack is a joke about dogs, but we need to consider more options to rule out. C: dog food might be a joke because dog food, though inhumane, is not a joke about eating dogs, which is what this question deals with. Similarly, A: French is a joke because a common joke about the French is that the French eat everything with the exception of dogs, so they joke about them eating everything except dogs.\n3rd step: We then eliminate C: chinese food and D: French from being jokes about eating dogs.\n4th step: This makes D: Good hands the only choice and the most likely option to be a joke\nSo the final answer should be D: Good hands\n\nInput: When driving in traffic, a car cut me off.

We eliminate options D, E, and F one by one based on the available information.\n1. The Tardis is a powerful time machine. There is no way it's controlled by a power plant or an office.\n2. The Tardis also apparently features gravity, and the central gravity well of the Tardis would not be located in the bowels of the ship.\n3. Hence, it can be safely eliminated.\n4. It's only a couple of options left now. These options describe a room, meaning that the control, which we're trying to find is in a room: the control is not in another room in the Tardis. It's not in the basement of the Master.\n5.

These are \"sneak previews\" of the available choices: A: The word \"perspective\" is a very important and relevant piece of information in this choice. What are \"perspectives\", but views or looks in an environment, particularly the visual look? \n3) This means the answer might be something visual. In the case of choice \"D: doors\" there are several doors seen in the context of this choice, so the doors may be a potential answer, but the choice uses the plural form, so that leaves door and windows. \n4) This does tell us the answer might be plural, but it is not a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to whether the answer is doors or windows (or both). \n5) Also, while both \"D\" and \"E\" describe visual, they are not quite", "answer": "B: center"}

Countryside is like the city center, while anthology is like a subway station or a sidewalk.\n4) Anthology is the second choice, so we can first rule out countryside. Countryside wouldn't usually be followed by anthology and we can also eliminate surface of the earth and state parks. \n5) Anthology is the answer. Let's see why by reviewing what we know: \n6) An anthology is a collection of writings. The writings may be poetry, plays, or any other genre of literature. But they are not television shows. \n7) The first choice \"countrysides\" is not a collection of writings, and doesn't seem to fit the word \"anthology.\" \n8) The second choice \"state parks\" doesn't even mention writing. They are places for recreation where people can enjoy hiking, camping, wildlife and all kinds of other natural activities.

We begin by eliminating obvious incorrect choices:\nDancing is not the favorite subject of a person who is most skilled at both traditional science and social science, because these subjects are unrelated to the art of dancing.\nReligion is not the favorite subject, either, even though both traditional science and social sciences study religion. This subject is not the favorite subject because it requires deep knowledge of the religious sciences and does not fit in the person's skill list. \n3. We now review the remaining three options. Geography, math, and history studies could be considered traditional science, although geography isn't as obvious as the other two choices. \n4. Social science is usually a catch-all for several subjects that are not \"traditional science\" but not \"religion\". Hence, these choices fall into the category of \"the favorite subject of the person\".\n5. Therefore, if they are most skilled at both, the favorite subject must be \"social science\" too. \n6.

{"idx": 414, "text": "1) The question calls for analysis of the context and the phrasing of the situation.\n2) From the above options, A: 'tiredness' and B: 'excitement' are both potential causes of the difficulty in starting work. Tiredness can cause one to not have energy to work, and excitement can cause distraction.\n3) However, from the context, it is unlikely that the cause could be tiredness or excitement of the individual. There is most likely an external factor causing the problem. In addition, tiredness and excitement seem to be inappropriate phrasing for what the person is going through. Both sound unrealistic and are not typical causes for a problem of inability to begin work.\n4) Option C: 'tireness' seems rather specific and unsuitable, although B: 'exciting' could fit, but it's also not the most direct answer to the question. \n5) Options D: 'progress' and E: 'procrastination' both fit the bill better in terms of appropriateness and directness. They both provide relevant explanations for not being able to start work. However, from the context (the sentence \"If you have trouble beginning...\" implies that the issue is not that you can't begin and then sustain your work, because that would make the opposite problem: difficulty in sustaining work, so we can ignore this option.\n6) Thus, D: 'procrastinating' and E: 'progress' are the only options as other options are irrelevant. \n7) The choice between D and E comes down to the nuances of understanding cause and effect. Although D: 'procration' sounds like a problem one might experience (since it describes the problem of a person getting behind in their work) it actually does not cause the inability to begin work (which, as mentioned before, cannot be caused by tiredness or excitement of one's own).\n8) E: 'progress' is more accurate than D: 'procrustination' and is the most direct answer to why work could be difficult to begin.\n9) Therefore the answer is E: 'procrustinating.'\nSo the final answer us E: procrastinating.\n\nInput: What is not an option if you want a plasma screen for your office?

A lover can want to get married to build a family together, but this is not a question about marriage. If a lover wanted to get married, the question would be \"After falling in love with your partner, ______________?\". Therefore, the correct answer was not marriage or family.\n5. Complete can be an end for a romantic relationship.\n6. However, what the question is asking us is what a lover would want to do with their beloved. To what end will this relationship continue? We can't know this unless the lover themselves make this decision. Thus, complete is not the right answer as it is a possible endpoint.\n7. Finally, the lover may make the decision to distance themselves from their partner. However, we know that they are a lover because they will want to spend more time with their partner, and that the option here is not \"complete\".\n8. Therefore, we conclude that the best answer is D: distance\n\nInput:Why does he want ice to melt?

E: because his mama doesn't like ice iced.\nOutput: This question is tricky because there is not a definitive answer. Some options are not logical.\n1. We cannot tell if the question \"Why does he want ice cream to melt?\" makes sense. We would know the answer, but we cannot tell if this answer makes logic, as ice cream is a type of ice that doesn't melt. Therefore, we cannot tell if choice A is the correct answer.\n2. Choice B does make logical sense because if a person doesn't want to melt their ice, they will want to keep their ice from melting.\n3.

Even if the copy machine is broken or outdated, it could still exist in a private home or community center.\n4. If the old machine is in an office, then the location is likely to be an office itself.

Choices: A: fried food B: carbs C: candy D: drinks E: fast food\nOutput: 1)  The question is likely asking about the result if you have some ongoing health issues, and someone tells you to stop eating certain foods.\n2) Since there is a restriction on eating certain foods for maintaining ongoing health, the person can be assumed to have a certain health problem that has to be maintained. \nThe focus of this question is on what the actual result of the given restrictions could potentially be.\n3) If an individual suffers from a medical issue relating to cholesterol or heart disease, the restriction on eating certain fried foods is crucial to maintain.\n4) This is because eating such food, if a person suffers from a medical problem associated with the heart or cholesterol, can lead them to an early death. These fried foods also affect blood fat, which could lead to a heart attack. \nThe restriction on eating fast food is primarily because such food is typically high in salt and fat, which may not be suitable for weight gain diet plans.\n5) Since individuals", "answer": "B: museum"}

When you think of \"performers\", you don't typically think of performers on a stage, you think of them performing on a stage. The stage is the key, so it must be where they are performing, which is likely a concert hall.\n3. Arenas don't have this. A building does not have a platform to have performers on it. Docks are out of the question for this. Museums are similar to arenas, and do not have performers.\n4. This means the answer is likely C: concert hall.\n5. We are looking for the performers, so any other people that are \"on\" the stage are irrelevant.\n6.

Animals with 2 hearts include mammals such as humans as well as vertebrates with tadpole-like qualities.\n2. For example, amphibians such as frogs or reptiles which have tadpole-like, aquatic juvenile stages that transform into adult terrestrial forms, have not one but two hearts.\n3. Another example is birds which have an additional heart in their gizzards to help process their food.\n4.

A: yellow B: red C: blue D: purple E: green\nOutput: The first thing to recognize is that the question is written in the form of \"which of these is the most popular?\" - which implies choosing one answer that is better than the others.  Because it does not say \"all of the above\" then we can eliminate multiple answers that do not say \"all of them\".  That leaves us with a question of \"which of these?\".\nThe second thing to recognize is that there are no answers that do not mention the color red, and that the answer must be one of the colors red, blue, or purple.\nThird, we notice that \"all of them\" was not provided, therefore, we are looking for an answer that has the largest quantity of each color.\nFinally, we realize all of the colors listed have the same number of them.

Also, it might not necessarily be surprising if someone has heard the joke before but was not expecting it at that time.\n4) Option B: humor. This is unlikely because humor can entail different styles of writing, and it's not always unexpected. It could be planned or unplanned, but it depends on the circumstances.\n5) Option C: frightened. This can be eliminated since this response isn't necessarily related to happiness.\n6) Option D: fight. This can be eliminates as it can lead to unhappiness.\n7) Option E: laughter. This could be eliminated because it can be triggered by many external and emotional circumstances.

Option B or imprevist could also mean the same thing, but has an unusual syntax.\n6. Option C or arcane could be another word that describes the daily routine, but it's not what replaces it.\n7.

He spoke to her of what's important in friendship? Choices: 1. A: money 2. B: status 3. C: common interests 4. D: common background 5.

Choices: A: belly B: arms C: tail D: eyebrows E: armpits\nOutput:1. The riddle states that the answer must be one of the locations given.\n2. Arms and belly do describe the areas where a feline might have hair.\n3. Arms contain hair, albeit small in some cases, and there are no hair on the belly of a domestic housecat.\n4. Armpits do have hair, but cats have no armpits.\n5. Eyebrows are also hairy, and may be present on cats with hair or on cats with a hairless face.\n6. In that sense, eyebrows are not unique to one of the locations given, so they are not an answer.\n7. Tail is not one of the given options, and cats do have hair in their tails, so \"tail\" is not an answer.\n8. So the answer must be either \"arms\" or \"belly\".\n9. This is because \"arms\" describes the hairless skin that cats do have and \"belly\" does describe the area without hair under most circumstances.\n10. \"Belly\" describes the area that a cat may be hairless, therefore the answer must be \"b\".\nSo the final answer  is B: belly.\n\n\nInput: The little kitten was very cute, he wanted to eat what?

Furthermore, the cargo ship could probably unload items more efficiently than a grocery store.\n5) A reiteration is that this cargo ship, is in transit and returning from a long sea-journey.

{"idx": 522, "text": "1) Let's understand the question. First, it tells us that a microphone boom is unlikely to be near a \"stock market event\". This might raise suspicion around the other choice options.\n2) We start by looking at options that could be relevant to a stock market event: D:GIG, E: RECORDING STUDIO. These could conceivably be part of a stock market event, if it involves live music, or the recording of a live presentation (such as an audiobook or podcast of a stock market speech or video).\n3) However, A:NEW YORK CITY could also be part of a stock (market) event. Since a BOOM tends to be large, and can be seen in stock videos of large scale financial news/stock trade events, we will consider A:NEW YORKEVENT.\n4) This limits our answer choices to either B: CONCERT EVENTS, C: TV STUDIO EVENTS\n5) But, we also realize that when there are microphone booms during a live stock market event they will probably cover the events that are on display. Thus, we start to eliminate option B: CONCERT. Because, concerts don\u2019t usually involve displaying stock market events.\n6) Now, looking at C: TV STUDTIO EVENTS, it is relevant that we see B:CONCERT events because these kinds of events, involving live performances often also involve TV STUDIOS covering the event. Thus, we start eliminating option C: TV STUSTIO EVENTS. But, it may not totally be eliminated.\n7) Because we still have event with B:CONCERT event going on. Because the other events will probably also be covered by BOOMS.\n8) Thus, we start to analyze A: NEW YORK CONCERT EVENTS. We know that there are B: CONCERT events going on in the city.

Cats don't play everyday and are not necessarily affected by opening doors and annoying others. They are fed by their owners. \n4) It is easy to eliminate C: need food and E: play as cats don't eat and play every day. Only D: needs food is relevant. \n5) Hence, the correct answer choice would be Option D: need food. Cats do need their everyday food, but don't drink everyday water.\nSo the final choice is D: need food\n\nInput: A man is standing at a train station, the conductor calls to the man for what?

{"idx": 530, "text": "Reason:\n\n1. 'Bleachers' refers to bench-style seats in an outdoor setting used for viewing sports games or entertainment events.\n2. Thus, 'bleachers' are most likely associated with stadiums and arenas that can be found in locations such as theaters, opera houses or lecture halls.\n3. However, stadiums and arenas do not typically house movie theaters.\n4. Similarly, movie theaters are not typically known for having bleachers. A few theaters, such as the Cineplex Odeon Theatres in Canada, make use of bleacher-type seating for large group moviegoing events.\n5. Therefore the answer can be eliminated for A: movies and E: hockey game.\n6. Among the remaining options, bleachers are typically associated with sports stadiums and arenas, and the opera is classified as a fine art performing art that is more formal and intimate.\n7. This means that opera theaters and opera houses are more likely to have bleachers than theater or lecture halls. \n8. Therefore, D: lecture hall and C: theater are considered plausible options.\n9. Among the two, theater is more likely to be associated with bleachers than lecture hall.\n10.

Since the phrase \u201csilver screen\u201d refers to a particular kind of movies, the choices in this question cannot be anything else except movie related. \n4. Choice C: theater does not seem relevant in this context as theaters or movie theaters would be a place to see films played but is not the screen itself. \n5. Choice D: screen cannot be relevant in this context either. Movies are shown on big screens, not small screens. \n6.

This could also make one think of the British House of Lords.\n5) The first two letters of \"House\" suggest that it could refer to a \"home\", but it wouldn't make sense that the congresswoman is one of the residents of an old people's home in her capacity as a congresswoman.\n6) Therefore, we should eliminate Options B and D.\n7) \"Assisted living facility\" does not make sense in the context of a US congresswoman. It might be more appropriate for a senior citizen.

Mountain bikes require great strength to control them, which in turn helps to build upper body strength and core strength.\n3). Mountain bikers also have a lot of upper body strength, which comes from spending a lot of time cycling up and down hills and using their arms to balance the bike.\n4).

Only the last option E: raffle ticket would be relevant for this question, since in some way it is related to their background, since it is more associated to the fact that one may be part of a certain ethnic group or have a certain job experience behind them that could be seen as advantage by someone in a hiring panel. Thus we can answer E: raffle entries.\n\nInput: While a boss might not want what from an employee, they do want what from them. Choices:  A : good work  B : good attitude  C: hard work  D: punctuality  E: good demeanor\nOutput: Considering 1) that the worker must do work and work hard, both A and C can be dismissed and 2) that a boss values the work he or she knows the employee has put and not the hard work but \"good\" work, option B is the most correct of all options.\n\nInput: A dog should be trained to heel, meaning that when the owner of the dog walks, the dog should walk at what rate of speed?

{"idx": 570, "text": "1) The grooming takes place in a specific setting. For this reason, the other options such as \"injury\", \"beauty\", \"late\", \"mistakes\" and \"annoyed\" cannot be considered to be choices for the question. \n2. \"Grooming\" typically refers to the removal of excess hair from an animal. \n3. The grooming takes place at a specific place e.g. a salon, which suggests the appointment for the grooming takes place only on an as-needed or appointment basis.\n4. The fact that the grooming would take place at a salon also implies that the salon offers appointments to its customers.\n5. Therefore the choice can be narrowed down to either \"injury\" or \"mistake\".\n6. However, \"injury\" cannot be considered to apply to any appointment for grooming or any other reason for that matter. The word \"injury\" generally refers to an accident.\n7. This means that it's most likely to happen when a mistake was accidentally or unintentionally made.\n8. Hence the answer is \"mistake\". \n9. Therefore the answer is B: beauty\n\nInput: What is a job's purpose? Choices: 1. To increase company productivity\n2. To help the client achieve\n3. To allow a person to make a good living\n4.

{"idx": 574, "text": "Reasoning: 1. The choice of question indicates that 'where' is the only relevant answer type. Given that the choices specify the activity in question, the reason for the question must be that the choices provide details of their contextual relevance.\n2. At a bank, one would stand in a line and wait to transact financial matters such as deposit withdrawals, and so would not typically be holding a cold-weather garment. \n3. Also, 'need a coat' would require the person to be standing outside, where they would not be waiting or inside a bank, where they would. \n4. The other activity options of waiting at a post office and waiting at a bus stop are typically associated with waiting outside and it is more likely for one to be cold and thus need a coat outside than to be standing in line and in need of a coat inside the post office or at a bus stop.\n5. Therefore the choices that make sense are: D: post office, E: bus stop, which leaves us with E: bus stop. \n6. At a bus stop, one usually waits outside, so they would be more likely to need a coat if the weather is cold outside than waiting within a bus stop or a post office, where they would be inside. \n7. Therefore, Bus Stop is the answer.\nSo the answer is E: bus stop \n\nInput:How would one clean between teeth in a subway?

{"idx": 578, "text": "1: This question poses the issue of how to determine the most likely location of a trash can in a city.\n2. To begin, we eliminate those options that are not found in cities. This includes parks and motels, since these don't have bins typical of cities.\n3. The answer seems to be in the form of a street corner, where corner is commonly referred to as the intersection in cities.\n4. Conversely, a bus stop would not be a typical location of a trash bin. This is more likely to be found in a shopping center, mall, parking lot, or somewhere else.\n5. Therefore the answer is likely at a street corner, which can be eliminated, leaving us with options D: bus stop and E: store front\n6. While corner does share some similarities to bus stops, it tends to be smaller, more basic, typically with a trash can.\n7. On the other hand, bus stops in cities have a more defined and structured design.\n8. Therefore the answer is, E: store front, as the storefront of any shop or business is often where the trash bin is found in cities, due to the volume of waste generated by such businesses.\n9. So the final answer is E store front", "answer": "C: corner"}
{"idx": 582, "text": "Avoiding Places:  Consider reasons why John might avoid going in public places.  From the question, we know that he avoids places with animal abuse so that he has no contact.  Hence, the places he may avoid are any place where animals are used for something unethical or harmful.  This includes places like a factory farm or a dog fighting ring.  There are other places where animal abuse could occur without john knowing.  Consider a park where dogs roam free.  It is likely that these dogs will be abused.  That is why John should always avoid dog parks.  Reasons for Avoiding Other Places: Pet store and parking lot do not apply for this question for two reasons.  John avoids places with animal cruelty. He does not need to avoid pet stores since dogs and cats are kept in pens and never mistreated.  John would also likely eat at pet stores because he is not looking for them to abuse the food they serve.  John would also want to avoid parking lots.  This is because it is very easy for an animal to run into a parking lot and be killed.  John avoiding animals in the forest would be silly.  There are far more animals that John could abuse than there are in the forest.  This is why John can relax near the forest without any fear.  There are very few places where animal abuse would be as widespread as in the forest.  There are several other places that John would not see regularly but would still know of them.  He would avoid North America (USA).  That is just too many possibilities where he could witness animal cruelty without trying hard.  There is far more animal cruelty in the North American country than there is in all of South America together.  There is nothing John can do about animal cruelty in South America.  John simply does not have time for it.  John avoids North America because of animal cruelty, he knows the place too well. The parks John visits would have animals.  There would be no reason to avoid parks, John may even avoid the few places where there is no animals.  He also avoids all places where abuse may occur without him knowing.

Choices:  B: not enough room C: too many things to describe D: too hard E: time\nOutput: 1] The author seems to be going through a challenge in describing his home. \n2] The first option,'not enough room' is not a valid point, as the author has to deal with describing objects in his house. Objects in his house, no matter how abundantly they may be, would still require enough room to be able to move. \n3] The second choice is probably what the author is referring to; 'Too many things to describe'. \n4] The author has too many things to describe, which means, he has to do it in different forms, such as a diary that he makes and describes the objects in his diary. \n5] The third option is very unlikely to be the answer since the author may need enough time and a lot of resources to make the diary. Moreover, he even has plenty of time to make it, since it may not be that urgent to him.\n6] Since it's the fourth option that is more correct, we don't need to worry about the last one and we can go on thinking of other options that the author could have gone through.\n7] As suggested by 'description' in the choice, the author can easily go on describing each time he looks at the objects; 'too hard'. The time that the author has got at this task may be the most obvious reason as well. \n8] Since the author already has the time and the resources and they aren't that much of a burden for the author, he can describe the", "answer": "A: read"}

Option A: driving: This is correct since driving cars is a type of activity entailed in moving cars.\n5. Option E: ticket: Moving cars isn't limited to driving but also includes people getting into vehicles and moving around. This option is incorrect.\n6. Option B: road: This option isn't incorrect, but the context of question implies that there is more to the process of moving cars than just driving on a road or even being on an empty road. So, option B: road can be eliminated.\n7. Option D: accidents: This is correct since part of moving cars involves driving which could lead to accidents.\n8.

Even though only hearing would seem accurate, however, hearing means hearing with the ears which involves sight and/or touch. \n3) No sight or hearing seems like a more accurate way to express the question, since no sight or no hearing would also include other senses.\n4) In light of our deductions, it now comes down to 1) only hearing and 4) no sight or hearing.\n5) Among these two choices, neither includes sight which means that the correct answer is 4) No sight or hearing.\nSo the final correct answer is 4: No sight or hearing. \n## Input: Someone was doing what to a computer before putting files on it?

A beam is a horizontal building support between two vertical supports in the building. It can't support the \"old rope\" because the rope can't be tied onto the beam and used to support something itself.\n3: \"Branches\" is the wrong context.

Choices:  \"A: television B: broad C: narrow D: host E: presenter\"\nOutput:1. The word compere is what is called a 'french loan word', or a borrowing of a French word that has been incorporated into English. Compere (comper in British English) in French means to host something or to introduce something. The original meaning of \"comper\" is to compete with someone.\n2. From the definition of the word compere, we can say a compere can be defined as a person who introduces performers, hosts entertainment, or participates in hosting such events.\n3. This word is used in radio broadcasts, on television, and in the theater.\n4. Therefore from the given choices our answer would be A: television. The word television is a proper noun, and we can't use a borrowed word to refer to the name of an entity, so this can be eliminated.\n5.

{"idx": 630, "text": "1. The context of the question is academic, so the options are usually related to English grammar. The question appears to be specifically in reference to the use of prepositions. \n2. Each option must always go with a specific word, in order to be properly used in a sentence. Article is used to indicate the position or status of something with respect to another thing (usually nouns). Adjective modifies the noun or pronoun. Interjection is a short exclamation (often in emotional reaction). Conjunction is a connecting word in a sentence (often used to provide further detail, especially about time or order). Pronoun is a word that replaces a person, place, or thing.\n3. Although each option can generally work with pronouns, the 'pronoun' category is more general and does include 'adjective'. Hence, this option can be eliminated from the rest.\n4. 'Adjective': 'Adjective' does not have to be used in combination with a preposition.\n5. 'Conjunction': Conjunctions combine two sentence parts, but must be followed by a verb. While they may be combined with nouns, they do not require the intervention of a preposition to be properly used in the sentence. \n6. 'Interjection': As 'interjections' are used to express emotion or emotionally charged thoughts, the question of using one with a preposition is irrelevant given the context. \n7. 'Article': Articles are followed by some nouns or pronouns, but not all. In any case, this option is technically incorrect, as a preposition can come before or after the article, or even between the noun and article. Moreover, when an article is used with a noun, it does not require a separate preposition to be properly placed for the purpose of combination. \n8. Hence, since each answer can be eliminated, the correct answer is A: 'article'.\nSo the final answer for this problem is A: article", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

It's not necessarily the most ideal location for a school, but it's a possibility.\n10) In conclusion, option C: every city is the best choice for this type of question.

{"idx": 642, "text": "1) The question is focused on where a notebook is typically purchased, which means it's related to the place of purchase, and not a place where notebooks can be sold such as a book store.\n2) Each word in the question, including 'often' and the word 'notebook', can have very different meanings. 'Notebook' can refer to a binder that consists of several sheets of paper for writing, or it can refer to a single sheet of paper that includes writing. When referring to one sheet of paper, the term 'notebook' refers to a place where you do things, such as your office or desk. \n3) Eliminating irrelevant answer choices:  D: can be ruled out immediately since it's not used to purchase, A: a book store sells notebooks, but it's not where notebooks are typically purchased, C: referring to Abraham Lincoln's grave would not indicate where notebooks are purchased, and E: although people may often go to the classroom to buy notebooks, it's not relevant to the word usage.\n4) The choice is between B: 'backpack', and C: 'desk'. A notebook is a piece of paper (also known as a'sheet') that people take with them when going somewhere, and C: 'desks' would refer to a place where you work, not a place to purchase notebooks. As a result, C: 'desk' can be eliminated.\n5) Out of the remaining answer choices, referring to 'backpacks' will more likely indicate where a person buys their notebooks.\n6) Therefore, the answer is C: 'backpack'.\nSo the final answer if C: backpack\n\nInput: Who will be watching you as you walk to the store for groceries?

A: deadly. Though being deadly can be dangerous and fatal, it is the cause in a different sense, rather than the act itself that is dangerous under the question.\n3.2. B: dangerous. Being dangerous is being wrong and can be dangerous.\n3.3. C: unconcermed. Unconcerned is a state of mind rather than an actual action. \n3.4. D: stressful. Being stressful can be dangerous, but the word stressful is not being applied to the situation.\n3.5. E: harder when weather is bad. Weather itself may not make things harder to drive on icy roads, but it can be dangerous under other conditions.\n4. Therefore we can eliminate options D: Stressful since that is not what the situation being \"dangerous\" pertains to. \n5. Option C can also be eliminated in the same way as option D. \n6. Finally, options A, B, and E all refer to a hypothetical dangerous situation and are what we are looking for. \n7. 'Being' is only applied to the entire situation.\n8.

{"idx": 650, "text": "1) The question pertains specifically to the use of 'dissipate' as a verb in the context of'money'. Usually, dissipate would be used to describe something that is being spread out or diminished in some way.\n2) Dissipate isn't typically used to describe a specific use or disposal of money and is generally more literal to describing a decrease in sum than a final action or event. It does not carry a temporal connotation.\n3) So the answer to this question couldn't possibly be A: dissipate.\n4) Other choices like C: disintegrate don't make any sense since money can't be used the 'last of it' and then be used to disintegrate.\n5) E: penultimate seems to be the most viable answer.

This means you need to eliminate the uncommon or unlikely consequences from your analysis to come to a reasonable conclusion.\n2: Animals don't typically sleep through an electrical storm (unless it's especially violent or a severe threat to their survival). So this can be eliminated as a likely outcome.\n3: This could be a possible consequence but it would be premature to conclude that it's likely to happen. Rather, it's more likely that the question asks you to select the most likely outcome, therefore, 'it is now raining' is highly unlikely as it would immediately follow an electrical storm that causes a lot of lightning.\n4: Similarly, this could be a possible consequence of an electrical activity, but as the others are all more likely, it can be eliminated.\n5: If we can eliminate 1A and 3C from", "answer": "A: dissipate"}

Choices A: bad feelings, B: confusion, and C: hurt feelings also don't seem like the appropriate options to explain the result of bringing a case to court and resolving it. \n7. Therefore, among the options, the most appropriate choice might be the D: confusion. \n8. When a case goes to court, it creates confusion, stress, and tension among individuals, and it often leads to a long and drawn out process of resolving disputes, which can be both financially and emotionally exhausting and damaging to an individual or a community.\n9.

The question pertaining to what people can't do if they don't have good nights sleep is what people will not do rather than what people can do if they have good nights sleep. Thus, the conclusion is that the impact of sleeping well on people's lives is that they would most likely not be staying up for too long.\n4. This can be implied by the answer choices we are left with:'staying up", "answer": "C: disneyland"}
{"idx": 706, "text": "1.\"Stopping being married\" refers to a divorce. This would need a lawyer which the question implies.\n2. Since the choice could be an option that is one of several possibilities, we may need to be a little more creative in coming up with the answer for this question.\n3. Since lawyers are expensive, 'legal fees', although may seem plausible, could simply be a part of the lawyer's fee and not necessarily the full fee.\n4. There are only two viable options left that could be the answer. \n5. We have to look for two adjectives that will describe two contrasting things that could be astronomical in value. \n6. 'Astronomical' could describe either the 'cost' or the 'time' spent in a court battle. \n7. We will need to look at whether the question is about one cost or one time period.\n8. If it is about one cost, then we can infer that this is referring to the high cost of divorce in the United States. \n9. If it is about time spent in court, then it is more likely talking about the long process it takes to officially end a marriage. \n10. Therefore, we can go with 'legal fees' as the answer. \nSo the final answer for this question is A: legal fees.\n\nInput:A sneaky raccoon got into your house when your weren't looking and made a giant mess.

Choices:  a) shovel snow b) paint c) put trash in dumpster d) sweep floors e) clean out dishwasher\nOutput: 1.'Your weren't looking' in the question indicates that you may be away from the house for some time.\n2. Raccoons are quite common in urban and peri-urban areas, sometimes in relatively small numbers and sometimes in large numbers.\n3. It is unlikely that a raccoon would be able to find a way into the house, get into the kitchen, rummage around, and make a mess like described in the question without human activity and supervision or awareness.\n4.

Choices: 1.) Help 2.) Water 3.) Food 4.) Money 5.) Clothes\nOutput: \n1) Let's begin by looking at each answer. \n2) Food: This is probably the most unlikely answer as food is not usually delivered using an emergency service. It could be classed as an emergency if you were waiting for dinner to arrive. \n3) Money: Money cannot usually be delivered because you would need to be physically there to cash a check. Besides, delivery services are not usually a priority when emergency assistance is required, so it could not be expected through one. \n4) Clothes: This could be classed as a form of \"material possessions\" that the delivery services might assist with, however the fact that clothes can typically be provided by a relative who is nearby means that it is an unlikely request to yell from your window during an emergency. \n5) Water: This one is the most likely answer. Aside from the delivery of medical assistance, medical provisions cannot easily be delivered by emergency services. \n6) A man in an emergent situation might ask for \"Help\" by yelling out from the window.", "answer": "A: residential neighborhood"}

In the context of the question, we are looking for something more general like 'blushing' or 'falling asleep'.\n3. 'Blushing' or 'fall of asleep' is something that typically isn't a sign of lying, but more of a reflection of the person's state of mind or health.\n4. The only other possibility seems to be the answer to A: ordering dog food. This can potentially be a sign of lying, as one might lie about ordering dog food.

C: i got a lot of compliments. D: i tried hard. E: my parents were proud.\nOutput: So in this question, we observe that the answers are divided based on two different situations where the question is: Did you feel like you did your best despite getting bad results or despite getting good results? I think the author was clever to eliminate the last three answers as they are more related to the situation where one got bad results rather than the situation where one got good results. Since it is the choice between two different situations, we can rule out the option where you had good results as well as the options where you did get the compliments as this question is about how you still felt like you did not give it your all even though you did your best according to the other three options. The two options where you did your best and your parents were proud may give you a feeling that you did your best even if you got a bad result or a good result. This is because, in these two, you are confident that you did your best and that your parents are proud of you. So, I think the two options are about situations where you did your best but the results did not go your way, and hence, you are worried about your results or whether you did your best the way you wanted to do it. Thus, the correct answer should be one that states that you still feel that you didn't do your best even though you did your very best. This is the option D: I tried my hardest. That's why", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}

This does not make sense as he'd have all his collectable items scattered all over the cupboards.\n4) C) Table. The choice mentions an entire weekend, implying that it is over a few days. It does not seem very likely a collector would be selling all his items onto his table, which in essence would amount to most of the collectible items spread all over it. It's likely he'd have a storage room or area for his collectibles.\n5) D) Flea market. While a flea market could be considered a specific type of market, it only operates on a market day during certain days of the week. It is unlikely that a collector would take all his items to a flea market to sell when one could sell more easily and quickly by other means. Plus, it's questionable that people sell their treasured collectibles at a flea market as it's not too private.\n6) E) Table-washer.

'Fairground', on the other hand, can be used for storage rather than food preparation. 'Friend's house' could be considered.\n4. The question calls for knowledge of a relatively fast moving and well-equipped mode of transportation.

Choices: A: drive B: walk C: speed D: slow E: travel\nOutput: 1) Drive and speed are both verbs for the action of traveling, so they do not make sense within the context.\n2) Walk would make some sense when the person is already at a place where they need to go somewhere else. This person would first need to figure out the route, and walk would be a logical choice if they are in a hurry.\n3) Travel could be an action of someone in a hurry to get somewhere because they need to, but it is a vague and general action that does not provide any more detail.\n4) Slow does not make the most sense since the person is in a hurry, and so they would need to take less time.\n5) Therefore, the most logical answer is, the action of C - slow to keep pace.\nSo the final options are E: walk and C: slow to keep pace.

{"idx": 746, "text": "1) There are a few relevant clues here. The phrase \"peak of his fandom\" could suggest that the artist is no longer at the peak of his popularity and needs to do something to capitalize on it before it's gone. It could also mean that he has a limited number of opportunities to capitalize and wants to do it while the tide of public opinion is on his side. \n2) However, the question requires us to identify a reasonable activity the artist can do to do so. \n3) We can eliminate A: selling out as it's not appropriate for somebody at the \"peak of his\" popularity. \n4) The remaining options are more or less viable ones, as they are all related to money. However, E: getting paid could be more of a logical response to doing something than B: happy. The man is more likely to get paid by doing something as per the instruction than to just be happy with the public opinion, and there's nothing in the context that suggests he is unhappy with the public opinion.\n5) The second option, D: receiving money, implies that he's getting paid by the fans, for taking away something he created with them. When a business receives money, it's paid not by its customers but by a bank or a lender, so it makes less sense.\n6) By process of elimination, it doesn't seem rational to choose C: fishing, because the reason to fish is that fishing makes one happy.

The answer has to be either body or garment. Road could be either hit or taking the hit, as it could be the object or take the hit depending on how you look at it. Therefore, it is less likely that the right answer is 'road'. Since road is ambiguous, it cannot be the answer.\n3. Body could be the answer, but in order to fall on your body, you would have to step on your legs (which would be on your body), so it could also be in your torso, garment, or your shoulder. So it's still ambiguous.\n4. Garment is the logical option, as falling on your garment, if it is a jacket, would actually mean falling on your shoulder.\n5.

The best answer has to be one that the highest number of people would use in an emergency situation.\n1. There is only one option with no context, stand still. But, it's common sense that standing still will leave a person vulnerable to injury or death in an emergency situation, such as a fire or a tornado.\n2. Jumping out of a burning building can actually save someone's life, so jumping is probably the safest answer here among all the contexts available.

So the birthday cake can be eliminated. \n4) We rule out a candle by a table in a dim room because candles serve to draw attention rather than deflect it away.\n5) This is a trick question, where we\u2019re given two opposite choices but what follows doesn\u2019t make sense. The choice is either A: dimly lit and a candle, or D: a birthday cake. There are no candles next to birthday cakes in restaurants.\n6) Therefore, we eliminate A and D and we can\u2019t eliminate C and E for any obvious reason. \n7) A candle must be placed in a wall (B) or in a dim room where a table resides, but not in a table (D). So the answer is clearly B: in a wall.\nSo the final choice is B: in a wall\n\nInput: One way to make a pumpkin pie is by chopping onion, which would cause to sting the eyes.

Adding chicken stock, we know, causes a sting in the nose- not the eyes. \n3.) Addition of milk creates a curdling sensation for some people. \n4.) Roasting in the oven won't hurt anyone's eyes. \n5.) Adding salt may cause irritation in the eyes. \n6.) Too much sugar, like too much chocolate, may cause blurriness in the eyes too. \n7.) All this being said- the only viable answer left is D.) Adding sugar.\nSo the final conclusion would be to add sugar to", "answer": "D: table"}
{"idx": 778, "text": "1.\"Child\" and \"goes to play\" provide some indication of the context to the question.\n2. A child isn't likely to do most of the options given. \"Laugh\" and \"being entertained\" are too specific in terms of expectation, with \"laugh\" suggesting mirth and merriment and \"being entrainened\" suggesting the child will find their play to be captivating and engaging.\n3. The child is likely to sit as they may take a break to sit or rest, or to listen or watch what other children are doing.\n4. Happiness isn't something you could point out as someone is going to it, it's an internal emotion they may feel or experience along the way. \n5. \"Walking slow\" isn't necessarily how a child going to play will be moving. \n6. The child is thus least likely to walk slowly in this context.\n7. \"Children walk slowly\", which is grammatically correct, is also not likely as it's referring to an activity rather than what a child may be doing going to play.\n8. Hence \"Walking slowly\" can be ruled out, leaving us with the most likely option: \"Walking\". \n9. Therefore, the answer has to do with the child walking, and not sitting, being entertained or happy.\nSo the final answers is A: walking.", "answer": "A: laugh"}

Choices:  a: during b: after c: prior to d: during lunch e: during dinner\nOutput: 1) There is a grammatical error. 'Man asked and barking' is incorrect. It should be 'The man asked if the doggy was barking'.\n2) 'During lunch/dinner' cannot be the answer because there are no breaks or lunches/breakfast and dinner in the sentence.\n3) It cannot be 'Prior to' because dog is not barking prior to dog barking.\n4) The dog cannot be barking during dinner because it is after dinner. During dinner, the dog would not be barking at all.\n5) 'During dinner' cannot be the answer as it is incorrect from '4' and the dog is barking after dinner, not prior to it.\n6) 'During luch' is incorrect because there is no lunch/dinner in what the man is asking.\nTherefore, it is 'after' because the dog starts barking after the man finished his lunch and started dinner.\nSo the final selection is 'a'", "answer": "C: own home"}
{"idx": 790, "text": "Reason:\n1. The context of the question here is one of wedding planning and a bride and groom taking care of their own wedding related matters.\n2. The phrase \"taking care of proposals\" makes it sound as if the bride and groom is working together to plan how they will make a wedding proposal. \n3. A ceremony is something that is done, an event where people are gathered. The options 'efficiency', 'getting work done', 'finishing up', and'results' all suggest the bride and grooms are working on their tasks, but they cannot be used to identify a ceremony because these are actions instead of events.\n4. Hence the context and meaning of the words \"taking care of\" does not fit with the options 'efficiency' and 'getting work done'. \n5. Option'marriage' doesn't make sense in this context, there is no reason a married couple would need to be concerned with their pending wedding proposal.  This is further clarified by the following line when the question states, \"...bride and groom.\n6. This means that it is referring to a specific wedding between these two. If they are married, they are already planning their own ceremony, which means they don't need a proposal.\n7. However, if the bride and the groom are already planning their own marriage, it becomes unclear what exactly the question is asking regarding a ceremony. \n8. Therefore, 'bride' and 'groom', even more than 'bridesmaid' or 'best man', have a clear and direct contextual understanding of one specific wedding between two individuals.\n9. Option 'ceremony' can be ruled out by the context of the question as this suggests a wedding event, but the bride and grooom are specifically planning for themselves.\n10.

B: Table. A computer can, of course, be placed on a table within an apartment, but it can also be placed on a table outside the apartment, such as while on vacation at a friend's house in a different town. Table, therefore does not apply. \n4. C: School. It is difficult to imagine a situation where a computer is needed somewhere other than a desk in school - if the computer is used for an assignment or an exam, it must, by definition, be located at a desk. Therefore, school does not apply. \t\n5. D: Office. A computer is not typically used in the dining room at the office. Rather, it is found at the desk at the office. Therefore, office does not apply. 14. E: House. Although the computer could potentially be used at a kitchen table in the house, by itself and independent of a school or office desk, it cannot be called a \"desk\" anywhere other than an office.

We can cross out the beach first because eating at a beach usually doesn't lead to an empty stomach, and the person is seeking the opposite.\n2. Option A: 'in a store', might not necessarily lead to an empty stumach, since one could purchase foodstuffs, even eat in stores, and still possess an empty stomach after shopping - it's not like eating at a restaurant where food is intended for consumption, leaving one with an empty stomach as a consequence of the meal.\n3. Likewise, option B: 'on a street' is similarly inconclusive. One can eat food on the street, but there are very specific types of food that are typically eaten on the street to satisfy hunger, and not necessarily lead to an empy stomach.\n4.

'Tentative' means not guaranteed but not totally impossible.\n3. Options : A: accomplish and C: make progress. The former can be understood as to have completed something previously or currently, but when used with the question, they don't refer to the current negotiation, as the agreement hasn't been made. The latter implies it has been progressive, in one direction or another to make the agreement.\n4. 'Stop arguing' or 'do business' can refer to the end result of the negotiation, which is indeed what the agreement was about. Hence, they are irrelevant.\n5. The word 'feat' is a non-trivial achievement that is very significant. 'Tentative agreement' is not such a feat.

Option E: busy city definitely doesn't help either, as we are looking for something specific that can be found in a bus station.\n10. Thus we can confidently deduce that the answer must be C: maps.", "answer": "C: maps"}
{"idx": 858, "text": "1) The problem refers to numbers that are columns of numbers being used in a spreadsheet.\n2. The bridge, pantheon and whitehouse have no relation with numbers.\n3) Bridge and pantheon is a physical structure and would not contain numbers.\n4) Whitehouse is an organization, not a physical structure that contains numbers.\n5) Roman architecture has a connection to columns, so the answer must be A: roman architecture. Roman architecture is a physical structure, containing columns.\nSo the final, correct answer is A: roman architecture\n\nInput: When people are on the water, what aren\u2019t they worried about?

{"idx": 862, "text": "1) Let's start with eliminating the options which don't make sense.\n2) Option \"C\", \"drink tea\", refers to a specific item, and not a verb.\n3) \"D\", \"feel angry\", also has to do with a specific behavior, not a verb.\n4) \"E\", \"cross streets\", is a very broad term, and it doesn't really make sense in the context of this question.\n5) \"A\", \"sign language\", can be seen as a helpful act, but it is mostly used in situations where both parties, the signer and the recipient of the sign, can understand sign language.\n6) \"B\", \"complete sentence\", is a sentence structure, and it doesn' talk about helping someone in the specific context of asking a question.\n7) This leaves us with option \"B\", \"complete sentences\". Using complete sentences or phrases is a helpful act in the context of asking a question when the person one is speaking with is likely to be unable to speak or understand coherently. The choice \"B\", \"complete phrases\", is the best fit here.\nSo the final choice is B: complete sentence\n\nInput: What is something that comes from the bacteria and other organisms in the intestines where they produce vitamins and hormones? Choices:  a. The stomach. b. The mouth. c. The bile duct. d. The liver. e. The kidney.\nOutput: Bacteria produce beneficial substances such as vitamins and heroins in a variety of environments such as the mouth, bile duct, the liver and the kidney. All of these areas contain bacteria.\n1. The question only asks what comes from the 'bacteria and other organism' in the intestines.\n2. Kidney is not part of the intestines. So, 1.kidney is ruled out.\n3. Bile duct is also not necessarily part of the intestine, so 1.bile duct is ruled out too.\n4. Liver is also not part of the intstine, so 1.(liver) is ruled out too. \n5. Hence, we are left with options 1.stomach and 1. mouth. \n6. The stom", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}
{"idx": 866, "text": "1: The context indicates that we are dealing with a situation where a gun is used to commit a crime.\n2. The evidence in question must refer to the gun itself or a forensic test of it.\n3. Option A could be ruled out because we are not given any additional information that suggests the evidence is in a drawer.\n4. Option C could also be ruled out because that would indicate that the investigator is returning the gun to the alleged crime scene, which doesn't sound appropriate. \n5. Option D could also be eliminated because it would imply that the investigation has been completed and the evidence has already been returned to the rightful owner.\n6. This narrows down our choice to either A: holster or B: crime scene.\n7. Based on the context, holster sounds like it would be the correct answer, because the investigator has access to the weapon itself, whereas a crime scene does not allow access to the weapon since the scene is closed off by law enforcement. \n8. Therefore, A: holster makes the most sense. \nSo the final answer has to be A: holster\n\nInput:Where should I put my socks if I want to locate them easily? Choices: \nA: a box B: a drawer C: a closet\nOutput: \n1. This is a very common question that many people face on a routine basis, and this quiz was probably developed to see if you have ever encountered it in your life.\n2. The answer that makes the most sense is B: a drawer. \n3. First, we need to eliminate the options that are unlikely to be the correct answer.\n4. Option A: a box typically does not make sense in this context because shoes may often be stored in a box, not socks.\n5. Option B: a closet seems like it could work, but that probably wouldn't be a common practice since the items stored in there are usually too valuable to be just put away in a drawer like some socks.\n6. Option C: a drawer would definitely be the likely choice of any reasonable person to place their socks. \n7. So the answer is B: a draw. \nSo the correct answer has to be B: a drawer\n\nInput: What is often required to complete a project? Choices: 1:", "answer": "C: police station"}

The options remaining are: A: square shape, B: different sizes, C: high walls, E: different sized rooms.\n3. The question asks specifically for a room that faces the outside. If a room faces outside, it cannot be square.\n4. Different sized rooms are not necessarily true for all rooms facing the outside. This is because different sized rooms do not have to face the outside.\n5. High walls can be true in some but not all rooms facing outside.\n6. Now that all options have been eliminated, the answer is B; rooms facing the outside will not have the same dimensions.", "answer": "D: doors and windows"}
{"idx": 874, "text": "1 - The question refers to what is generally true about people who are models.\n2 - We can eliminate choice A: very ugly because when people are models they are by definition not very ugly.\n3 - Choice B: appear beautiful is an acceptable answer if taken in a more general sense, but it's not the direct interpretation of the question.\n4 - We can eliminate choice C: free slaves because although it's possible for models to participate in freedom-based movements, they would most likely be free already.\n5 - Choice E: suffering pain is not an accurate description of what happens to models in general as they're usually not models by virtue of their pain.\n6 - Hence, the right answer is choice D: pay bills. The fact that models have to pay their own bills means that they're usually the source of income for their families, so the question can be interpreted as a statement on that fact.\nSo the final choice is D: pay bills\n\nInput:Which choice is not one of the many options I have for a vacation? Choices:  B: Travel A: Sun B: Beach C: Trip E: Traveling\nOutput: 1- In this situation, the most appropriate choice will be which choice is not one of so many choices for a vacation.\n2- We can eliminate options that are not appropriate for the given situation, such as option \"a\", because the question clearly states that the answer will be a choice among many. Option \"a\" does not meet this requirement.\n3- Also, Option \"e\" can also be eliminated since the question specifies that multiple options will be among the answer choices and the option given is \"many\".\n4- Moving forward, we eliminate options: \"a\", \"b\", and \"d\".\n5- Since it is stated that \"I\" have multiple vacation choices, options \"c\" and \"e\" do not apply either.\n6- This means the choice that follows is \"b\"\nSo the final choice to fill in the blank is B: Travel\n\nInput:Where can you find the name of everyone attending a party?

{"idx": 878, "text": "1) Fear can lead to sweating. Sweating, coupled with motion or activity, can produce perspiration (which might lead moist hair with it). 2. There isn't any context to justify run or fight. Swimming might be the closest one to be drenched, but that may be too specific. Given the clues, we eliminate run, fight, swim, urinate as the answer. 3. Being full of fear for a long while and being wet, may cause hair fall. Hair fall itself may lead to being drenched. Therefore, if a person is in a state of fear for a long time and then is wet, the context suggests that he or she recently had long hair and that has now fallen off. 4) The answer is C: calculated things quickly.\nSo the final  answer is C: calculates things quickly\n\t\nInput: What can't you find in a jungle but might find in a forest? Choices:  B: animals C: wildlife D: trees E: plants E: huts E: natives\nOutput: 1.) Animals, plants, trees, and natives are the likely choices. However, plants are less likely to be found in a jungle as they could be overgrown and difficult to see. Animals and natives can be found in both jungles and forests, so we can eliminate (D) forest.\n2. Among the options, in a jungle, plants would be limited to vines and trees, so (E) vines would be eliminated. Jungle natives would be likely to live in huts as they would be closer to the ground and easier to make than in other built environments. Huts are often associated with natives, so huts can be eliminated as well.\n3. In conclusion, only two of the options, animals and wildlife would be likely to be found in each. Therefore, (B) animals and (C) wildlife would be the only possible answers.\nSo the final answers are B: animals and C: wildlife\n\nInput: What can you look up in a library?

Therefore the answer cannot be C: living room.\n4) The question is about a sofa bed in particular and not other kinds of beds.\n5) The child was an adult sleeping, which means he was probably sleeping by himself.\n6) A guest room is typically not separated from other rooms. This means the child would not have been sleeping in a bedroom, leaving only the remaining options.\n7) Option B: horseradischis an irrelevant word: It is not related to the word 'bed'.\n8) Option E: basement does not provide enough context. The question does not say the room was in the basement. It only says it is in the parents' home.

A doctor can practice a specialization, but it does not necessarily mean he is qualified to perform all procedures within that specialization.\n2. A doctor can provide anesthetics but they do not have to be qualified to deliver babes.\n3. Doctors usually have to perform hysterecomies before they are qualified to be gynecologists.\n4.

Some possible answers are A: wishing well, B: kitchen, C: hardware store, D: garage, E: utility room.\n3. Among these options, A: wishing well should be eliminated as it provides no insight into where janitors get their pails.\n4. Among the other options, B: kitchen, D: garage can be eliminated. These options are not likely to provide pails to janitors because janitors do not typically wash kitchen dishes or clean garages.\n5. C: hardware store and E: utility room can be eliminated for the same reason, they are not likely to provide janitors with pails to clean.\n6. This indicates that the only remaining option is B: kitchen. Janitors are more likely to fetch their pail from a kitchen where they are washing dishes compared to other spaces.\n7. Therefore the final answer is B.\nSo the final key answer is A: kitchen\n\nInput: What is it? Choices:  It's the biggest question ever asked. \nOutput: 1 The question can be understood in different ways. For instance, \"What is it?\" can imply that it is an unknown item with no context of what it is. \n2. Another interpretation is that, despite the lack of context, the answer is clear if the asker knows it. This can be compared to a similar question where one asks \"What's wrong with you?\" when they think there is something wrong with the other person, but the other party says \"Nothing\".  \n3. As we do with other analogies, we will look at other options and their possible relationships with them.\n4. Looking at the other options, 2. \"It's the biggest question asked every year to a high school senior\". \n5.

{"idx": 898, "text": "Reason: Sally experienced strong side effects as the result of taking a medicine.  The question asks about what doctors said about the side effects.\n1. This question calls to examine the usage of the word \"distinguished\" within the context of medicine, its applications, and its connotation.\n2. The question is primarily concerned with the \"side effects\" itself, i.e. the reaction of the patient to the medicine.\n3. The phrase \"experience side effects\" is most accurate and common in the context of medication.\n4. The \"side effects\" are often referred to in terms of degree, like \"mild side effects\" or \"severe adverse reactions\" which suggests that \"distinguished\" would be a misnomer here.\n5. In addition, doctors are more likely to refer to severe reactions as \"disturbing\", \"unwanted\", or \"undesired\" whereas \"distinguished\" seems more likely to apply to favourable reactions.\n6. Therefore, the answer has to either be C: \"remarkable\" or E: \"peculiar\".\n7. The phrase \"exclaimed their doctors\" is vague and could refer to adverse effects as well. \n8. Since \"peculiar\" does not reflect the usual usage of the word, i.e. \"peculiar and unpleasant\" rather than \"distinguished\", it is the best answer.\nSo the correct answer is E: peculiar\n\nInput: The book was about to be shipped off to a customer in a few minutes.

We can eliminate the options : T : The customer was not waiting on the train. The customer is likely at the delivery location, waiting in the bookstore. B : There are 11 words in the clue, so the bookstore can be ruled out. C : At the counter, there is a clerk who can shelve books for customers. D : The bookshelf does not make sense because clerk is shipping the book. E : Waiting at the shelves for a book", "answer": "C: remarkable"}
{"idx": 902, "text": "1.\"Here\" refers to the specific place mentioned in the previous sentence (\"the bookstore\") and could not be anywhere else.\n2. Out of the given options, the only choice that would make sense is A: briefcase, because the bookstore might be where you carry your pen. \n3. The phrase \"buy a pen\" indicates that you can already own a pen, but want to purchase another one, and not the first one itself, so it can't refer to D: office supply store.  \n4. The choices C: friend's home and E: classroom are also unlikely. You cannot buy things from friends or places like classrooms. This can be understood contextually as they are common places and you wouldn't buy a pen from there.\n5. The phrase \"...where you can\" suggests that there is some particular place where you can buy pens, so you can't buy a pen in just any place you walk into.\n6. Hence, 'briefcase' would be the only correct answer.\nSo the answer is A: briefcase\n\n## Contributions\n\n@siddharthsharma:\n1.

{"idx": 906, "text": "Reason: 1. This is an analogy question that requires one to think about what connections a person might have and then figure out if such a connection exists at a particular place.\n2. Among the choices, the airport would not be a location for connections because passengers are supposed to get onto and off of planes through the airport, but not make a connection with any person, company or thing during their stay.\n3. Option D: Computer network is not a suitable location for a person to have a connection because it is a type of interconnected computerized devices.\n\n4. Option A: \"company\", in a broad sense, refers to an organization of people who have a shared work, goal, belief, or interest. It's not a specific location for a connection.\n\nOption B: \"airport\" could also be a suitable connection location, if it refers to a destination on the route of a traveler's journey. The airport would be a possible destination for a traveler, or somewhere they had to go to after an unexpected delay.\nAlso, \"airport\" could mean an actual physical structure, in which case a person would not have a connection in it, but could certainly be delayed or meet someone there on their travels.\n\nOption E: \"love\" is an emotion, and it is not commonly used as a location. Also, \"love\" could be a directional adjective that refers to the quality or state of something, such as love for a person, where the connection might be found, but not the person per se.\n\nOption C: \"Wall\" would be the most obvious connection location since two people can be connected by a wall or a barrier between them. However, an actual physical wall is unlikely to be a connection because it could not be an actual connection with a person, not a connection with something like a phone screen.\n\nOption E is also out. If there is no wall in a location to prevent an actual connection between two people then that could be where a connection would be found, not a connection with love.\n\n5. So, there is only one answer left: B: Airport\nSo the final answer here is B: Airport\n\nInput:: What was the hurricane of 1605?

This sounds like the opposite of foolhardyness at first, but we need to look at the word \"careful\" as opposed to \"cautious\". Being careful is doing something thoughtfully and not doing it foolishly, so we can eliminate this and proceed with the final choice of E: careful.\nSo the final correct answer is E: careful\n\nInput: What are some good ways to wake yourself up in the mornings?

Looking for people standing on a line is more general, so that can't be the answer.\n2: People standing near a road can be found at a bus stop, but 'fire house' isn't a commonly used collocation for that context. Also, the term 'line' in the context of a fire station could refer to a line of fire trucks, not a line of people.\n3: Although there could be military recruits lined up in front of a base building, this isn't the type of people standing in line that are being referred to.\n4: Similarly, people waiting under the shade of an apartment building are waiting for someone to let them in. It's not a line of people waiting to get access some place.\n5: Looking back, the line being referred to must be near a place that people are allowed to be inside. If they are on a military base, in the apartment building, or in a fire house, they're no longer on lines.\n6. Hence the answer is: E: Bus stop\nSo the final answer: E: Bus stop.\n\nInput: If we're in the air, is the air really in the air? And if we're running, are we running? Are these notions paradoxes?

It's similar to saying that our breath is not our blood, although it's in our blood.\n2) The opposite is true for when we're running: we're running where the air is, it's logical and not paradoxical since air is everywhere except in air itself, so the notion that air is in the air is illogical.\n\nInput: When you're looking at somebody do you see them as a mirror?

We start by eliminations options we believe are incorrect: A lot of animals do not live on mountains nor do they live on jungle. So, the remaining options must be grassland or the shore.\n2. However, the answer is neither grassland nor shore. If the answer were grassland, the word in brackets would not be in all caps. Also, if the answer were shore, this is just a redundant word.\n3.

Anxious means \"worried,\" and it also means to be fearful of something. \n2.

{"idx": 930, "text": "1.`The question asks us to identify a place where one may view sharks in a tunnel.\n2.We start by eliminating incorrect places: The South Pacific doesn't contain clear tunnels with sharks. Sea World is a theme park that usually contains aquariums that display many aquatic animals and exhibitions. 'Indian Ocean' is mostly the ocean surrounding the Indian subcontinent.\n3. Therefore, the most likely location is C: Pacific Ocean.\n4. Since the question asks where one can view sharks in a 'clear tunnel', the term 'clear' and 'tunnel' must have some specific meaning relative to the question text.\n5. When using a tunnel to observe something inside, it is usually a very transparent structure. Also, the tunnel usually functions as a medium to carry light and provide more visibility.\n6. The only possible context where 'clear tunnel' and'sharks' could be used in this way is in an aquarium.\n\n7. Hence, the correct response is C: Pacific Ocean, an aquarium.\nSo the final answers is C: Pacific Ocean\n\nInput: What is the one thing that all kites have in common? Choices: 1: long and large 2: made of different materials 3: made to fly 4: only for hobbies 5: red color\nOutput: The question asks us to name one thing that kites have in common. We can then eliminate options that do not refer to the same thing.\n1. This option is probably an indication that one kite might have a long and large size in general.\n2. This is an assumption, since options 1, 3, and 5 are more likely to be true, and not all of them. Option 4 describes that kites are for relaxation or hobbies, not that all kites are only for leisure activities. \n3. This option is too vague since not all kites are for a person to fly, not all of them for sure.\n4. We know from the previous elimination that a long and large option is no longer a contender.\n5. The question is referring to some form of similarity or consistency that all kites have, so this is too random, given the other options remaining.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Kites have the \"long and large\" attribute.\nSo the", "answer": "B: sea world"}
{"idx": 934, "text": "1 The scenario assumes someone has confessed to killing someone, and the question here is why they would do so.\n2. The answer choices can be narrowed down as following, \n3. For option A: Guilty conscience: It's unlikely that someone is confessing to murder out of guilt as the scenario does not contain any detail about how the person obtained such guilty feeling. \n4. For option B: fear: This is a plausible answer, as a person could confess to keep themselves safe, particularly if someone else is being blamed for the deed. \n5. For option C: go free: Not likely, as the only reason a person would confess to avoid prison time is if they did not actually commit the crime - i.e. if they were under false imprisonment. However, in this situation, they are already in prison despite knowing they are guilty, which makes this unlikely. \n6. Hence, we can eliminate options A and C.\n7. For option D: problems: It's true in some scenarios, but in this case, such problems have already been present in the form of prison, and will only worsen their lives by confessing. \n8. For option E: Find God: It's possible that someone could feel remorse for their actions and seek redemption, but it would be an unlikely outcome as God is already aware one has committed the deed, therefore there would be no need to confess. \n9. Therefore, the only answer we are left with is B: fear. \nSo the final answer in this question is B: fear.\n\nInput: A cowboy is looking for a place to sleep for the night.

E: no such place 3. Output: Looking closer at the question, we can pick out important detail and rules. \n4. The cowboy wants to get a good night of sleep at one place. The question says one night only, and no place, so the cowboy will have to move on to another place the next day.  \n5.

Although the word \"alone\" can be used to describe this type of group, it is not in the correct spelling.\n5.

Therefore, this eliminates options C: get dirty and B: sniff.\n3. Option A is to hang in closet, when clothes really can't be wash.\n4. Option E: air out, if the smell won't go away then it might be a sign that the clothes are old and should be thrown out.\n5. Option D: become soiled, if clothes become soiled it means that they were probably not washed well the time they were washed, and so they need to be washed again.\n6.

One of those is to grasp something with your hands, why not use a more general term? Choices: 1:  A: reach B: achieve C: obtain D: make E: contact\nOutput: Reason:\n1. The definition of \"reach\" means to grasp or obtain something with the hands.\n2. The more general term \"make contact\" (option E: contact) does not involve hands.\n3. The term to \"obtain\" something means to acquire it (option A: acheive). One cannot obtain anything unless one \"reaches for it\". The correct general term is to \"achieve\" something (option B: achieve).\n4. \"Obtain\" also means to \"attain\" something (option C: obtain). This does not mean you have to use your hands to get it, which is what \"reach\" means.\n5. Hence, option C is incorrect.\n6. As for option D: to \"make contact\" is not commonly used to mean grasping or grabbing something. \n\n7. And option E, to make \"contact\" is not a commonly used term either. Therefore, the correct choice is option B: to \"achieve\" means to reach for something.\nSo the final final answer is B: achieve\n\nInput: An unpleasant sound made when objects clang together.

{"idx": 946, "text": "It is possible that the inability to learn something might make someone more stupid in some situations and more intelligent in others, but it may also cause them to behave more ineffectively.\n1. The options given in the questions are all reasons why someone might fail to learn a skill, trait, or set of knowledge. None of these options are directly indicative of success.\n2. The statement \"the inability to learn could cause distress or cause someone to be ineffective\" is not directly relevant to the options given.\n3. It can be reasoned by logic that the word 'intelligence' should be ruled out, because it is not listed as an option.\n4. This is a common practice in this reasoning style of question where the statements listed in options and answers are almost always contradictory (with the exception of correct answers).\n5. It is possible to learn something, but not know how to utilize it, because one does not know all aspects of utilizing it. For example, someone might learn to swim, but not know how.\n6. Furthermore, it is not likely that one could know the reasons why they aren't learning something and the reasoning be directly indicative of the success they are having at learning it.\n7. Reasoning that A: intelligence B: effectiveness and C: distress are not direct indicators of success.\n8. It can be ruled out that the answer could definitely be D: a stupid person. This is due to the fact that ineffectiveness could lead people to make mistakes, which would lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of their actions.\n9. Furthermore, there is no direct indication that the person is actually stupid, there may only be an indication that they are unable to learn.\n10. One might also be able to learn something and utilize it effectively, but still not have achieved perfect results. So the answer is not definitely E: a stupid person.\n11. An answer could instead be either D: distress, E: a stupid, or something else like H: a person of any other category of intelligence.\n12. Hence, this leaves us with choices D: distress and E: a stupid person, as there could be a possibility that someone is ineffective in some aspect of a certain task or skill they are trying to learn, but are not necessarily stupid either.\nSo the final answers of the two choices is: D", "answer": "D: distress"}

Options 'A: god' and 'B: mix' can be eliminated as the option has to do with talking to people, and 'A: god' is talking to a superior power and 'B: mix would mean talking to different people. Therefore, the options 'C: with people' and 'D: have friends' can be eliminated.\n4. Further, the option 'C: with people', even if considered to be talking to different people, would mean talking with people in the group that you are in.\n5. The option 'E: see people' does not make the sense as it doesn't make the sense as the people were talking and not seeing others in general.\n6.

However, multiple rulers that are owned by different users, which the question requires, would not be stored in a drawer in the office for the same reason.\n4. Hence, it is unlikely there would be multiples in the same drawer that belong to different people\n5. Also, \"Ruler\" is not an object one would find in England\n6. Hence, the answer has to belong in a drawer, and the most likely choice for this is the desk drawer where it can be most easily found.\nSo the final choice is E: desk\n\nInput:When was the word 'Girl' first used as a name for a magazine?

If a human wants to enjoy the company of another human, they may go to a friend's house, but that doesn't apply here. \n3. \"Workplace\" does not really capture the right context of this question and so this option can be eliminated. \n4. The answer seems to be \"friend's house\" but in this instance, a \"friend's house is not a human. \"Place of work\" is more than just the \"humans place of work\" and can be the place of work in general. \n5. This leaves us with the choice of \"friend's house\", a place where humans go to be in the company of other humans. \nSo the final answer has to be A: place of work\n\nInput: On the road near my house, there is a hill and a park. This question pertains to reasoning surrounding the park. It is unlikely that one would have to go to a park to find what? Choices: A: water B: dirt C: wildlife D: wildflowers E: pigeons\nOutput: So, this roadside park is unlikely to provide one with wildflowers or water, because if these options are the answer, it could have been provided in the park itself. Furthermore, dirt is unlikely to be provided by the park, as it is a landmark feature and an unnatural phenomenon. Pigeons won't be found in a road-side park, and the park is unlikely to provide water. But wildlife can be found in parks, both flora and fauna could be possible in the form of insects or plants, or wild animals like birds and mammals.  There certainly is wildflower life in parks. While we cannot infer from the question that the park should have wildflowers, we can at least deduce that wildflowers are a possibility from that park.  The question does not ask about one or more parks, so it cannot be the park itself which provides what is sought after. \nThe roadside park does not supply water, nor does it have dirt, pigeons, or wildlife, but it does have wildflowers. \nThus, the answer can only be E :", "answer": "C: friend's house"}

{"idx": 12, "text": "1) The question is asking: What was the wife feeling before she decided to get a divorce? The options given are feelings she might have before getting a divorce.\n2) The question is concerned with the wife only and her emotional state rather than the husband\u2019s. Therefore, only the wife\u2019s emotions are relevant in answering the question. We need to focus on which feeling the wife felt before she decided to get the divorce.\n3) Let\u2019s go through our options, eliminating what does not match the situation:\n4) Option A, B, D and E refer to feelings she might have before the divorce, but the question is concerned with how she felt before deciding to get a divorce. We don\u2019t know whether she decided to get a divoerce before or after she felt these emotional states.\n5) Option C refers to what the wife actually felt before she decided to split from her husband, but actually her feeling in that state is irrelevant as the question asks \u2018what she felt before\u2019. We need to focus instead on how she was feeling before she made her decision to get a divorce \u2013 not the actual emotional state.\n6) Therefore, the answer must be Option B: Anguish.\nSo the final decision is A: anguish\n\nInput:How can someone tell if the tires are too tall or too wide for their car? Choices: 1) When the wheels won't turn in place it's too tall\n2) When the vehicle cannot take corners too wide it's too wide\n\nOutput: 1.) This is true, but this is not correct. The wheels are only considered to not turn in place if they are jammed. Otherwise the vehicle can still travel, albeit somewhat strangely.\n2.) This is also true, but this answer is irrelevant because of point 1. This would not necessarily indicate that the car is too wide for the tires.

The 'Everglades' is a marsh, while Louisiana is a flatland. It also seems very unlikely that Bill's life would take such a dramatic turn for the worse, causing him to be stranded in the Everglades.\n6. The forest could be the swampy marshlands of northern Louisiana or the lowlands of Southern Louisiana, but certainly not in Cajun.\n7.

The option for which one tends to feel sick is not likely since the dishes on a tasting menu are usually small. 4. Hence, the options left for selecting the correct answer are A: full stomached and D: getting full. 5.

Choices: \n A: oil refinerie B: water fountains C: schools D: a show E: wells\nOutput: 1\"Where would you get water that was not available as drinking water?\" The options in this question do not logically make sense when combined and in the context of this question. By looking at each option separately, we can eliminate options like drinking water from the water fountain as it is already available to drink. Option D: a show would typically be referring to a place where people are performing rather than receiving a drink. Similarly, option E: wells would also be a more difficult choice as this would typically refer to a well dug to get water for a household. This option would, in most instances, also be available for drinking and would not be of use in a scenario where you had to choose where to get water when not available as drinking. This leaves us with just option C: a school. A school would, most likely, be supplying drinkable water through drinking fountains as required by law, and this supply would be not available as drinking due to it being only for use in schools. Therefore, the correct answer is C: a school.\n\nInput: What's the last thing that happens to the letter after it's written?

{"idx": 36, "text": "Reasoning:\nThe thickness of semen depends on a person's individual testosterone levels, and other factors like age, health, and diet.\nAfter a vasectomy, the vas deferens inside the body that normally releases semen from the seminal vesicles that contain it (where it gets its density) are severed or blocked off. This blocks the release of semen and it reduces blood flow to the tissues of the testicles. \nTherefore, the options to consider should be a blank, sparse, thin, clear, or free flowing, reflecting the differences in density or viscosity of semen.\n1. It is unlikely that 'blank' would be an option because semen doesn't have this characteristic, but other options could work.\n2. 'Spare' or 'thin' could be ruled out as they're not opposites, so 'clear' and 'free flowing' would be more likely candidates.\n3. 'Clear' or 'free flowing' can be eliminated because they're not opposing answers to 'thin', and'spare'. Therefore, we're left to consider 'thick' and'sparse'.\n4. Mark's semen would definitely be 'thick' at first, because this would be true irrespective of the vasectomy. This initial \"thickness\" would make for a'spare' semen volume overall.\n5. Also, Mark's semen is 'blank' or 'clear' after the procedure, because semen before the vasectomy is typically white or milky in appearance, but after (due to the lack of seminal fluid), it is either not visible, or a milky or clear color; hence, the answer is C: spare.\nSo the final solution is C: sparse\n*Correct answer: C: sparse", "answer": "D: clear"}

Choices: 1. A: on top 2. B: with a lasso 3. C: in her pasture 4. D: in his arms 5. E: underneath her stomach\nOutput: A cowboy would most likely catch a horse that got away through an open gate with a lasso.\n\n1. A: This cannot be the answer because horses are too large to catch on top.\n\n2. B: This choice would not be suitable because \"escaped\" indicates that the horse would have to be far enough away from the cowboy to need lassoing.\n\n3. This would make sense if the cowboy's horse escaped and fell in the pasture together with the escaped horse.\n\n4. If the cowboy caught his horse in his arms, he would not be able to keep the horse from escaping through the open gate, which was the initial problem, in the first place.\n\n5.

Although going to prison is certainly an option, this is not a common practice for convicted murderers that is used as punishment.\n4. Therefore we can eliminate 'going to prison'.\n5.

A headache is the result of the person being grumpy, so this choice is the best fit. \n5. Option B: \"Understand themselves\" is not likely, because grumpy people are not likely to reflect and understand how they feel.\n6. Option C: \"Compliments\" is highly unlikely as grumpy people are most often not likely to give the person compliments.\n7.

Although this toll road may connect to neighboring states, its primary access point is the Massachusetts Turnpike, which only connects to the neighboring New England states. It cannot be referred to as an eastern United States toll road.\n3. The question is seeking the geographical location, and while the John F. Kennedy Highway may connect to neighboring Connecticut, its primary access point isn't Connecticut because that would be the Massachusetts Turnpike.\n4. Hence, the best option is A: Massachusetts.\nSo the final option is A: Massachusetts\n\nOutput: The man took his girlfriend, the boat and dogs  with him, where would the question most likely be asked in real life? Choices: 1. At a marina 2. At a boat launch 3. On a dock 4. At a lakeside picnic 5. At a restaurant\n\nOutput: Reason for Answer:\n1. We can eliminate options 2, 3, 4 and 5 because any person on a boat would be carrying at least one dog, their girlfriend, and their boat. The man has not been asked to leave his dog behind.\n2. On the other hand, the last question might be asked at a restaurant or a marina while the person is ordering the food or using the launch.\n3. However, we can also eliminate option 1 as this can be said for any person who is using their own boat, which is not necessarily the case with this scenario. \n4. Hence, since this would be the case for a boat that has not been owned by this person, we can eliminate the second option. \n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the most likely option is option 3, which refers to a boat launch.\nSo the final choice becomes Option 3: Boat launch\n\nInput: What could you not buy from the same place you rent a movie?

{"idx": 80, "text": "1. In the given context, the word 'aloof' suggests that people have difficulty connecting or bonding with such an attitude. We can further understand this from the phrase 'experience when meeting'.\n2. Being aloof and being self-important suggest an attitude that one is superior to others or above them in terms of social stature. Therefore, it is unlikely that this individual would have any positive experiences when meeting others because these characteristics would be considered as objectionable traits. \n3. Furthermore, the phrase \"self-important and aloof\" suggests that the person has a strong sense of self-worth and believes others are below them on some level, so meeting people would likely be stressful or nerve-wracking for them.\n4. Given that the options are'stress', 'nervousness','making new friends' and 'being bored' when meeting someone, all of these can be ruled out because none of these indicate any positive experience that an individual who is 'aloof and self-important' would have when meeting others if they are exhibiting the traits above. \n5. Therefore, since none of the options suggest a positive experience, the most logical answer should be B: 'nervousness'.\n6. The attitude of aloofness and self-importance could make one nervous or uneasy when meeting others. This also makes sense given the phrase 'experiences when meeting people'.\n7. Therefore, we can say that meeting people is stressful because the person exhibits these traits.\nSo the final score is A: stress", "answer": "D: being bored"}

Choices:  I: the size of the garage  II: how much it will cost to park there  III: where it was last before you\nOutput: This question is related to parking lots.\n1. The car parked at a large parking lot cannot tell you the size of the garages in the area or what the parking lot might cost to use.\n2. Hence option I: the size of garage is inappropriate. \n3. The driver may have noticed that his car has been parked many times before at the location, but this will not tell one the cost of parking.\n4. Option III: where was it parked before is the most appropriate as an answer.\n5. Option II: how much it costs to park there is another option to consider. But it is not as specific (e.g. cost, costing and costing-wise) and thus is more indirect.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer to this question has to be III: where it was parked before\nSo this question is a no-go.\n\nInput: The teacher taught students to work cooperatively, she wanted collaboration between them.

{"idx": 92, "text": "Logic:\n1. The question asks about the likely outcome of someone being angry after getting drunk.\n2. While the question specifically mentions anger, it can be assumed that the angry person is also likely to act angrily when drunk.\n3. 'Violence' and 'falling down' would not necessarily indicate one to act angrily towards others.\n4. 'Vomiting' can be ruled out because the angry person is more likely to act angrilly, not vomit more.\n5. 'Falling down' can be ruled out for similar reasons.\n6. The only thing left as an option is 'lower standards'. This choice is a much better fit to explain someone's angry and aggressive behavior after getting drunk. It's hard to maintain one's standards when drunk, and harder still to lower any further.\n7. Hence, 'lower standards' is the most appropriate answer.\nSo the correct answer is A: violence\n\nInput: The girl was very nervous, the doctor told her it was normal, what? Choices: A: nothing to worry B: nothing to be overly concerned about C: a sign of weakness D: a normal bodily response E: an indication that she was too excited\nOutput:\n1. In this context, the word 'normal' can be interpreted as one's usual or common state or demeanor.\n2. We can eliminate the other options:\n a. As in nothing to worry about, nothing to worry about should not be interpreted as nothing to be concerned over- as this is incorrect usage based on a literal reading.\n b. Being overly concerned is a bad thing, as per the original context.\n c. A sign of weakness is incorrect as it's neither being concerned, nor the normal bodily response.\n d. It would be odd to equate the 'normal' response with an indication, as it is not abnormal to get nervous if you are sick.\n i. Therefore, the only choice that fits the context is E: an indication she was too excited.\n So the final answer is E : an indication she was overly excited.\n\nInput: What could you do to increase your odd of being able to solve the riddle?

After that, we can rule out choices that do not require mental effort:'stress', and 'boredom'.\n4.) Since stress is a state of tension and fatigue in the body, it is unlikely that that would follow hours of housework.\n5.) Similarly, boredom implies feeling restless, in which case it won't be felt after a long period of housework.\n6.) That leaves us with 'anxiety'.\n7.)

Choices:  (A) runs away, (B) barks at the door, (C) becomes agitated, (D) chews the couch, (E) pees somewhere.\nOutput: 1)The context of the question specifies that the situation involves an apartment and a dog.\n2)We can then eliminate choices that are physically or anatomically impossible for a dog, which would be 'barks at the door, barks at the door' or 'pees somewhere'\n3)Choices (A), (D), and (E) do not require mental or cognitive effort. For example, choosing (A), running away, does not require a dog to consider anything, just run.\n4)Also, since (B) barks, (C) becomes-agitated, (D) and (E) are about things physical dogs do, and not something they perceive or feel, they can be eliminated.\n5)Based on above, (C) is left as a choice we can consider.\n6)Cognitively, dogs perceive situations, and react to them appropriately.\n7)As such, it is a possibility a pet would perceive something that disturbs it and it will become agitated.\n8)hence,the answer to the question is (C) becomes- agitated.\nSo the final choice", "answer": "C: stress"}

In the context of this question, it could be that the person goes to church because of the influence or teaching of their spirituality. \n5) In addition, this may indicate that the person who has undergone positive changes due to influence of spirituality goes to church to inspire others with their own story or testimony about how their life was impacted.\n6) Hence 'go to church' would not be the response choice.\n7) Between A: 'go into court' and B: 'paying attention', one could argue that they may hear testimony/stories of the effect spirituality has had on lives of people who have undergone positive change. However, this seems an insufficient reason for visiting church in the firstplace. Also B:'paying attention' doesn't imply watching or hearing testimony specifically, either.

If anything, the options'small apartment' or 'big house' might apply to the owner's actual feelings.\n4. So the real question being asked is: 'What does the dog see and feel?'\n5. 'Basket' and'small'. Here,'smallness' indicates the viewpoint of the dog, not the owner. Also, what the dog sees is different from what its owner sees. The owner's impression of how spacious the house is and the dog's impression of it can be two different things.\n6. 'Staying strictly indoors' is just a clue to the context. It's unlikely for a dog to feel spacious in living room from that point of view.\n7. What the dog feels it sees is probably something the owner sees. The dog perceives the space where it walks back-and-forth as large. Its viewpoint doesn't change based on where it sees the dog park, a small apartment, or a big house. But when it sees the owner's living room, the dog perceives that space as bigger than a basket, a small apartment or even a big house. This isn't a feeling the owner might associate with these other options so the answer has to be 'living room' or 'indoors'.\n8.

We can disregard D: coma \n4) Sky diving is an activity by which pilots jump out of a plane in which another pilot has just let them go. \n5) A pilot does this because the plane is flying too high to allow a jump, or the pilot needs to let passengers out. \n6) Playing uno, unlike a jump, is done solely by a pilot or someone else (like unicycling or knitting in a plane). \n7) A pilot wouldn't play with a passenger unless they were a fellow pilot, to which B: death, C: falling down and E: injury, would all apply.\n8) To begin death, injury and falling down, the most reasonable option as it seems like more severe actions, and E: injuries makes more sense to occur after they began to lose consciousness\n9) There is no reason to believe E: injury can't occur while the man is still conscious too\n10) To add to this, it is more likely B: death or falling down, as the death option would be if he fell down from the plane\n11) A: injury, C: playing uno, and E: falling down, are all incorrect based on the context as well and are all eliminated too\n12) Therefore, the only options that make sense in this context are B: death and E: falling down\n13) Considering the facts, we choose E: falling down.\n14) This means it's safe to assume there are options A: injury, C; B: death, D: coma, E: falling down that can't be narrowed down.\n15) Considering it is already narrowed down from 16 unique options to only two left, A: injury and E: falling down should make sense. \n16) This means we cannot disregard A: injury.

I can either call for a tow before I run out of gas, or I can wait until I run out of gas and then call for a tow, but calling for a tow when I haven't run of gas on my way home from work, wouldn't get me anything. \nSo the final choice would be 2.

{"idx": 168, "text": "1 The question is about what a badly-constructed massive building could be.\n2. From this, a few things can be understood: \n3. It's clear that the answer cannot be good, since it's a negative property. \n4. Insubstantial is also unlikely. It seems like an odd choice because, although being \"badly-constructed\" is the operative property of the question, \"goodly-constructed\" would not necessarily result in it being an actual good. Furthermore, even if the \"bad construction\" is to the extent that the building is now insubstantial, this is not a bad thing, rather it is just a fact given the circumstance. \n5. Massless would not be the correct answer either. Being massive and massless would seem to be direct opposites since their definitions state that massless is \"not having mass\".\n6. Neither would D: inconsequential. This is because although it's true that an unreasonably massive and poorly constructed building would be \"inconsequential\" to the people using it (with respect to its intended function), it seems more like an afterthought rather than the question. What's more probable is that \"inconsequential\", in this context, would refer to the inconsequential significance of the building, rather than the fact that it's inconsequential to its structure. \n7. E: bad would be the correct answer, as it's obviously related to the word badly-constructed.\nSo the final choice is bad.\n\nInput:When a pile of bricks is not stacked properly, what remains?

First, let' see what parts of the skull will hold the weight of the skull.\n3. Option A, bone marrow, does not directly support the structural weight of the skull, and is not relevant here.\n4. Option C, jawbone, is also irrelevant as it helps chew food but does not support the weight of the skinned skull.\n5. Option D, muscles, can be eliminated as its support for the weight of the skulled head is indirect, and a skull that is skinned has only supporting bone.\n6. Therefore, we are left with the two that hold the skull in place, A: Neck and B: Brain. \n7. Given what we have learned so far about the support of the weight of a human skull, the only option that can answer the question is B: brain. \n8. A brain can provide stability to the weight of the skinnned skull by virtue of the skull's attachment with the brain, as well as a skull's attachment to other parts of the skull, including that of the jawbone. \n9. The brain's stability is also supported by the attached cerebrum.\n10. Therefore,", "answer": "E: learning about"}

Option B: stand uprights (sic). To stand upright means to be straight, or in an erect manner. You don't cross the street when you are standing upright.\n5.) Option C: speak spanish. To speak Spanish doesn't mean to cross streets or to stand upright, as would be the answers.\n6.) Option D: speak chinese. To speak chinese doesn't mean to stand upright or cross the street, as would be the other options.\n7.) Thus, it becomes clear that \"I\" can't speak spanish or chinese. The word \"speak\" in the question is referring to \"talk\" and not \"language\".\n8.) Option E: further education. This may refer to schooling, but it is unlikely to refer to crossing the street, or standing upright. Thus, option E is most likely referring to education, as the sentence suggests.\n9.)

A: to capture something 2. B: by surprise 3. C: to get up high 4. D: to throw things that are lightweight 5. E: to hunt\nOutput: 1st Reason: If you were using a slingshot to capture something, you'd be on your hands and knees or even on the ground, not high up to use it.\n2nd Reason: In most cases, you would never fire something using a slingshot that was a surprise because it wouldn't be accurate enough for that.\n3rd Reason: Flying off the ground into the sky isn't a practical or common use for a slingshot.\n4th Reason: To throw something that's lighter weight, you'd want to use something like a pouch. You wouldn't use a slingshot. (lightweight vs. heavyweight).\n5th Reason: You wouldn't use it to hunt in any practical or common scenario.\n6th Reason: Lastly, one purpose for a slingshot is to play and you wouldn't likely be throwing things unless it wasn't so fun :)\n\n7th Reason: The answer I came up with was that you wouldn't ever capture something without being on the ground and without it being a surprise (at least within common usage). I also figured that one of the common uses of a slingshot is as a toy, meaning that that option shouldn't be chosen. I also couldn't think of anything that a slingshot would be used to capture that wouldn't involve throwing. That left me with hunting. \n8th Reason: The slingshot is used for throwing something and the only obvious way to hunt for large game would be that way.

Among the options, the 'own home' would almost certainly not have an attic, as it would be stored within the home itself. As for the'material' option, this would not be an appropriate home to have an attic for the same reason about the storage space within the home.\n3. 'Top of the home' doesn't make much sense as an attic would be above a roof or upper floor, not directly on top of a home.\n4. 'Living room' would also be unlikely as an attic is more about storage than living quarters. 'Bedroom' would also be unlikely.\n5. The correct answer is E: Victorian. Victorian homes are historically rich and were built during the 1800's when items used in their construction tended to be more complex and intricate and therefore better placed for storing in attics.\nSo the final answers is E: Victorian\n\nInput: I thought I'd see John again today but he didn't show up so now I want to talk with him about what? Choices: A: our conversation B: his reasons C: my ideas D: his business E: my intentions\nOutput: 1.\u201cWhat\u201d here is asking for the subject or topic of conversation that a person was expecting to have with John.\n2. The sentence mentions \"so I want to talk with [h]im about what\" so, John and 'him' can't be talking about 'them' or about'my intentions'.\n3. This narrows down the question to either \"business\" or \"ideas\" from \u2018my ideas\u2019 or \u2018my intentions\u2019.\n4. For \u201cbusiness\u201d, both \u201cplans\u201d and \u201cthings\u201d could fit the question, but \"plans\" makes sense as a subject for a business conversation.\n5. A subject for a conversation is often not about what's happening now so \"today\" could be eliminated.\n6. This narrows down our choices to \"Ideas\" and \"Plans\".\n7.

Choices: A: rays of light B: clouds C: tall buildings D: pine trees E: street lamps\nOutput: The answer has to do with a person's shadow, which is seen in the context of a sunny day.\n1. This eliminates the options 'clouds', 'tall buildings' and 'pine trees' as these do not represent objects that reflect sunlight.\n2. Since'street lamps' do emit their own light, they can also be eliminated.\n3. The remaining two choices now come down to 'rays of light' and'shadows'. However, the question specifies 'our own shadows', which points towards the answer being'shadows'.\n4. Therefore, the answer has to do with shadows.\n5. Hence,  'E: street lamps' can be eliminated since a shadow could be cast by street lamps. Only options A: rays of lights and B: shadows are left.\n6. 'Ray of light' is a non-contextual term and can be eliminated.\n7. 'Shadow' should still be eliminated since'shadows' also appear elsewhere in the question, and are the answer.\n8.

This is a type of produce, but not what one may get when putting on lotion. \n4. C:'smooth skin'. The person could have put on lotion because they had rough skin and hoped that it would go away. But lotion is not typically used to treat skin disorders. Therefore, this is also out.\n5. B: 'fresh smells'. This answer, unfortunately, is a misconception, as lotion does not provide a \"fresh smell\"\n6. E: 'headache'. Lotion is not typically used for headache.

He has forgotten you completely.\nOutput: Reason: 1. 'He was injured badly' might seem like a correct answer, but considering the context, it appears unlikely that the man's injury was the cause of the breakdown in his relationship with the person.\n2. 'He didn't like your conservation' might be a correct answer, but it doesn't seem to be supported by the contextual information provided.\n3.

'You stopped talking with each other' is not an accurate answer considering that the two people were in the same University. The question is, what happened to that man? It is not asking what happened to the speaker.\n6. 'He told his friends to keep distance from you' is not supported by the context, there is no indication that this man had any such behavior in his past.\n7.

This is clearly incorrect, because we know there is no way to gather a large crowd to know the statement is incorrect.\n7 The second choice is \"No\". This clearly can't be true. The statement is incorrect, and if we just said that then there was no need to gather a large crowd in the first place.\n8 So we can cross \"yes\" and \"no\" off.\n9 And finally, The third choice is \"Not sure\".

The phrase'see the world' could also mean that John wants to travel to many different places in the world, which is one of the motivations a soldier might have for joining the army. \n5.

However, 'acute' would be used to describe a shape that's obtuse or difficult to read or fathom, as opposed to being 'obtuse', which has been used in the question to mean 'hard to understand'. 'Acute' is the opposite of 'obtuse'.\n3) The options 'pointed', 'clear', and 'easy' can't be what something is if it's 'obtuse'.  \n4) Thus, the appropriate answer is A: pointed\nSo the final answer in this case is A: pointed\n\nInput: In the United States of America, where should one take a picture of their kodiak bears?

Choices: \n A: doctor's office B: grocery store C: church D: library E: bar\nOutput: The question asks how one can receive information, in this case, advice gratis and in context. \n1. This question requires understanding the question in context and the meaning and implications of the words themselves to reason and determine the answer.\n2. Grocery store is out of the equation as the information being asked for is typically specific and of the nature that doesn't require one to spend time and money buying a product before receiving the information.\n3. A: doctor's Office is not a proper place to get free advice because of the nature of the interactions with a doctor. However, this is a common contextual usage of 'advice' so this is eliminated.\n4. A: Church is also out since there is no need to get information here.\n5. A: library also doesn't make sense since books here can't be borrowed for free. \n6. As the other options are ruled out leaving C: Church. Though, it can't be free.\n7. Hence, the answer is D: Library. Advice given in libraries is typically free as against some other paid advice.\nSo the final option is D: Library\n\nInput: Where is it recommended to purchase a boat?

It doesn't make sense to ask what it means if something is out of order.\n9) 'Being annoyed', 'being frustrating' and 'delays' are all possible answers. 'Frustrating delays', on the other hand, are not meant in the question. This can be further eliminated as it is an overlapping phrase.\n10) Among all the choices, the correct answer is C: delays.

Choices: \nA: tea party B: dinner party C: lunch party D: breakfast party E: buffet dinner\nOutput: Let's define our context:\n1. A tea party typically has some sort of social gathering at home but is likely to be smaller and more private compared to a dinner party.\n2. Dinner parties tend to be invitation-only and larger compared to tea parties and lunch parties. They also have a more formal, traditional nature.\n3. A lunch party is also a smaller, more casual affair compared to a dinner party or tea party. Lunch parties, especially those at workplace, are less likely to be strictly by invitation.\n4. A buffet dinner is a large group meal with open buffet on a platter with an added cost of drinks. The meal can be ordered separately. The attendees needn't be specially invited. Thus this is eliminated.\n5. We will therefore rule out options B,C and E.\n6. We also have the option of a breakfast party or an afternoon tea, however a breakfast party is an informal casual affair whereas the afternoon tea is a formal affair.

Choices:  C: keep it short (B)D: braid it (A)E: comb it (D)\nOutput: 1.) The question is quite complicated and requires one to understand the context of the problem at hand.\n2.) It is apparent that the girl has recently cut her long hair. We start by eliminator irrelevant choices; D: comb it and B: keep it short don't really have any relation to the question at hand.\n3.) The remaining choices are A: braid it, E: comb it, A: braid it.\n4.) However, if the hair is cut short, braiding should not be an option, eliminating D and E.\n5.) Hence, braiding is not the right thing to do.\n6.)

{"idx": 376, "text": "1.\"What's happening\" can mean a number of things, but for the purpose of this question, it means \"to be awake\".\n2. Since the answer should be about being aware of something, it is not likely that the question is speaking about being aware of a large number of things, and the reference to someone \"with awakened eyes\" indicates only one thing.\n3. So, B: \"deep sleep\" is a wrong answer because a person in deep sleep isn't awake, or able to be aware of \"what's happening\".\n4. It's unlikely that someone who is \"awake\" would have eyes \"that are open\". So, for this question, A: \"alert\" and C: \"open eyes\" could be ruled out.\n5. A person can be \"conscious\" of things \"for a very long time\" but this doesn't necessarily mean they are \"able to be aware of what's happening\". \n6. A person can be conscious but not know \"what's happening\" because consciousness is not necessarily a sign of awareness. \n7. Similarly, a person can be awake and aware of \"what' a happening\" without being conscious that they are awake.\n8. Therefore C and D can be ruled out as well. \n9. We can eliminate choice A: \"alert\": \"What's happening\" doesn't mean the person is alert or aware of what is going on. \n10. This leaves choice E: \"conscious\" as correct answer because it implies being able to be aware of what is happening around one.\nSo the final result is E: conscious\n\nInput: There are six people living on a boat. The people are who? Choices: 1. A: a family 2. B: a couple 3. C: a bunch 4. D: a set 5. E: a group\nOutput: The purpose for the question is to test your knowledge about families in general and determine from the options which one is more appropriate to describe the group of people living aboard a boat.\n1. In most circumstances, a boat is not considered a large dwelling area or home, and would fall under \"transportation\" as compared to a house or estate for the purposes of this question.\n2. From that context, the options for which kind of group of people are", "answer": "E: conscious"}
{"idx": 380, "text": "1.\"Race\" can refer to several contextual applications, including sports and interpersonal interactions. \n2. Looking at each option in detail: \n3. A: Lay eggs. In races among human beings, this does not apply as this would be out of context.\n4. B: Eat fruit. It's possible that someone participating in a race may eat fruit, but that wouldn't have anything to contribute to their performance either. \n5. D: Wrestle. This can happen during a race in which two people compete against each other, but wrestling isn't exclusive to race games. It often occurs during normal interactions between two people as well, so it doesn't necessarily have to do with race either.\n6. Therefore, considering the other options (C, D, E), the most apt answer by elimination is E: Draw Pictures. \n7. Races can be used as a means of communication where people draw pictures, write words, or send any other form of communication, as a way of \"competing\" over who has the best form of communication. \nSo the final answer becomes E: draw pictures\n\nInput: Which animal has a long lifespan? Choices: 1. A: dog 2. B: giraffe 3. C: lion 4. D: antelope 5. E: frog\nOutput: \n1. The question asks about which animal has a particularly long life span. \n2. Considering this, each of the choices can be examined individually:\n3. A dog has a relatively short life span.\n4. C, D and E all refer to antelopes and thus cannot be the right answer. A lion also has a relatively short life compared to a long life cycle of an antelope or frog.\n5. Lions and antelopes both have short lifespans compared to an elephant which has one of the longest lifespans among animals.\n6. Therefore lions must have longer lives than other animals.\n7.

The ground is getting wet, it doesn't refer to a particular person who is feeling cold.\n4. E: skin rash. Similar to D, it's not a person who is feeling cold, but rather the ground that could have a rash.\n5. When the ground gets wet, it does not mean you will have any rash, just as in A) it does not mean the ground itself is solidifying: this doesn't make sense since wet implies liquid.\n6. As for B) since liquid could turn into ice, it's not that ice is near you, but a liquid is turning into ice.\n7. This leaves us with C) \"melting\". This makes most sense when one considers the wet part. Liquids turn into a gas as they are heated and water vapor is released. The vapor could be melting or evaporating.\n8. Therefore the answer is C) melting to turn into steam.\nSo the final choice is C) melting.\n\nInput: You go on vacation in a small town, while their is no crime, theres no one to go out with. Which are you?

B) uninterested, because it indicates the opposite of what the answer should be.\nSo it can get eliminated. Similarity C) bored because it means one is uninterested, not the opposite. D) interested means you want to go out with other people.\nAnd it can be eliminated. So we're left with choices E, F, G, H. I don't like H because it's uninterested in everything and G makes zero sense since interest is a positive thing.\nSo we're left with E which could indicate it's just not bothered and F which is you're being too hard on yourself and it", "answer": "B: melting"}

However, the context makes it clear that the answer is not one that is common to fountains.\n3. This leaves us with water spouts seen in the ocean. Water spouts are very rarely observed indoors, so 'basement' is not the answer either. This means one has to look for a location that can be described as a sink or a beach, or an ocean.\n4.

A: library 2. B: coffee shop 3. C: office 4. D: rest home 5. E: bedroom\nOutput: 1) The goal is to find peace where there is turmoil, so we want to look for a non-turbulent environment, preferably one surrounded by things in calm order.\n2) A rest home is not non-turbulence, which means A: library is correct because it is an environment without turmoil, a place where you can find peace while resting. \nSo the answer is A: library\n\nInput: what are you supposed to do when the dog is out in the yard? Choices: \t1. A: yell 2. B: call him 3. C: pat him 4. D: throw a ball 5. E: ignore him\nOutput:\t1) Yell and call are ways to get an animal's 'attention' instead of ignoring them, so they can't be correct ways to deal with a dog in the yard. \n2) Pat is the way to calm animals, and throwing a ball is not the way. Therefore, pat is the best option here. \nSo the correct answer is B: Pat the dog.\n\nInput: A woman wants to get from point A to point B. What route should she take?

As a general rule, supermarkets tend to sell items like groceries, whereas a hardware store or a department store is unlikely to.\n3. Closets are not very likely to have shopping bags with handles, to pack groceries.\n4. 'Mart' is not used as a common reference to a type of store.\n5. In home environments, closets are more likely to carry clothing, and there is no implication in the question to use a shopping bag meant for groceries for one's wardrobe.\n6. Hence,'mart' and 'home' can be eliminated.\n7. A hardware store could carry such an item, but if one needed a bag for groceries, a hardware store may not be the most obvious place to go shopping. 'Hardware' stores are typically known for the sale of tools, and other materials and items used in home repair and construction, not groceries.\n8. Therefore 'hardware store' can be eliminated as well.\n9. Out of B: home, C: closet, D: mart and E: hardware store, 'closet' makes more sense as the place one might find bags for packing grocer.\nSo the final choice for answer is C: closet\n\nOutput: Reason: Given the context of the question, closet would suggest that the item can be packed into a bag within the closet.\n\nInput: When traveling, which transportation mode is often the fastest but the priciest?

Choices:  First, let's eliminate the options that are not likely answers: The human eye can detect blue light, but it's not the only choice as the question asks about what it is 'considered' to be. The sun is not the only source for green light, it can be made from other sources of light too, but the question asks about what's 'considered' by some as the only choice.\n1. The answer has to be somewhere in between 'blues' and'reds' in appearance. Both answers are too dark, 'violet' is not enough, neither is 'yellow'. That narrows our choices to 'greens' and 'oranges'. Green and orange are shades of color.\n2. Green is a color and so is orange, but one of the options must still be the only color visible in night.\n3. The red is only one option, not the answer. The other two options are not considered even though they're colors.\n4. So the final answer is D.\nSo the final anawer is D: green.\n\nInput: A common way to start a fire is with what?

Although buying cheap may be a desired outcome of a purchase, when it comes to the purchasing of goods, it is actually considered a disadvantage. Cheap items or labor may be low quality, and sometimes people are even looking for inexpensive options because they cannot afford the full price of something. Buying cheap can also mean buying overseas or from companies which engage in unfair labor practices and employ illegal child labor. These types of practices are detrimental to communities, employees, and to the earth due to over-consumption and overproducing. \n3.) What can a family tell if this is so is, whether or not the money they have saved is worth the negative consequences as a result of cheap purchasing. Not to mention the possible loss in revenue if that family member in question is trying to earn, and the cost of having to buy more at a later time to compensate for the initial, cheaper purchase. \n4.)

The remaining options - A: factory, B: supermarket, and C: warehouse - are viable, but the garden and the garage options have to be rejected since they are too localized and do not imply a larger community. \n4. The phrase is more generic and could apply to both a supermarket and a warehouse, which could be large enough to accommodate hundred or more rows of large container. Because of this, choosing either A: supermarket or C: warehouse is reasonable.\n5. The word 'row' implies a lengthy arrangement of items that were arranged next to one another. The arrangement could be done vertically or horizontally, but the 'row' of items would have a length of some kind, and be located to be viewed from a distance. \n6. The most useful choice is C: warehouse. Warehouses are large, organized containers that store goods. In the question, this item is probably being sold and therefore has to be organized in some way and visible. Hence, a warehouse is most likely to have a large length of 'the container' laid out with other products to view.\nSo the final and most correct answer is A: warehouse\n\nInput:The man who had no hair needed a what to cover his head?

{"idx": 448, "text": "Reason for choice:\n1. The question asks about where a yard might be small. However, a \"yard\" is not a static location within these areas.\n2. Rather, it could be in a particular spot on the lawn, in a fenced area, in a garage, or even off the property.\n3. Farmland might be used for growing crops, but a small lawn with just grass is unlikely in this setting.\n4. A neighborhood would not be home to many farms. It could be that a suburban neighborhood, with houses situated more closely together, could fit many yards into one area, but it likely would be much larger than a \"small\" yard.\n5. A city, despite its population density, is unlikely to have as many yards as a suburb, and even so, the yards would likely be much larger, if there are any at all.\n6. A subdivision would be a development where plots of land have been divided into plots of land (aka \"Lots\"). However, these \"Lots\" are not yards. Typically, a subdivision has a \"yard\".\n7. In the context of all of these areas, a \"yard\" would be defined as a small plot of land that is separated off from another plot of land, within a household's private property.\n8. Therefore the answer is D: property.\nSo the final answers is D: property\n\nInput: Where is a man able to drive his own car? Choices:  C: road D: garage E: parking lot F: street \nOutput: 1 This question involves reasoning on the context in which the phrase 'able to drive' is used. The options offered could all be correct or incorrect, and to pick the correct one, we will need to look at all of them separately. 2 As the man is his own car, he would theoretically be able to drive it wherever he goes. However, he would only technically be in the position to drive it if he is sitting in his car. The question doesn't specify such a scenario. 3 It's unlikely the man is behind the wheel of his car in a garage. A car is most often kept in a garage and the man won't have a car at all if he is not out of the garage. 4 While the man could be a passenger in a moving vehicle,", "answer": "C: city"}
{"idx": 452, "text": "1. A paper program generally refers to the list of upcoming events published in a theater or a music hall.\n2. Hence, the likely places for finding a paper program are the theater or the musical stage.\n3. 'Computer,' 'opera,' and 'television' aren't likely to carry a paper program since they are different media and have their own modes of program display.\n4. Similarly, 'concert' is not a place per se; hence, this choice cannot be deemed a likely place for finding a paper program.\n5. Therefore the choices to be eliminated are: computer, opera, television, and concert.\n6. The only remaining choices now are theater and a music hall and we can eliminate the music hall because it already includes the theater.\n7. If someone is looking for a concert, then they could also be looking for a music school. \n8. Therefore, we can eliminate a music school because it's not something that is necessarily looked for when finding a program.\n9. Hence, an opera or a theater are the most suitable places.\n10. It's more likely that someone who is going to see a performance will get a paper program in a theater compared to an opera, as a theater is more likely to provide the facility to read a program.\n11. Hence, B: theater is the most likely place to get a program.\nSo the final answers are A: theater\n\n### Note:\n\nThis code is based on the paper \"How To Create Data\" in the ICML 2021 Workshop on Data Generation", "answer": "C: opera"}

Choice B: can are also ruled out since cans don't have lips.\n4. Choice D:snake would be eliminated since snakes have a fang which is not the answer to the question.\n5. Therefore we are left with two choices A:mouth or E:Kentucky fried chick.\n6. A'mouth' only works when this is used as a body part for a living animal.

E: potato 6. F: can\nOutput: 1) The question asks us what exchanged.\n2) Let's look at the answer choices - \n3) A: knife is out because she didn't get a knife - she received an apple.\n4) D: Coin is out because she didn\u2019t receive a coin. She got an apple.\n5) Potato is out because she traded an apple for a coin and a potato is out - she had no choice but to receive a coin.

It means that house is above the ground, usually near the roof, and doesn't refer to 'two separate floors'.\n4: 'Attic' requires the presence of an upstairs as the definition of an attic is an unfinished space of the second floor. It requires an upstair to be an attic.\n5: 'Basement' is the lowest level of a building, which can be a concrete slab directly on the ground or built above the ground.\n6: 'Upstairs' and 'Bedrock' are also irrelevant responses since they refer to the upper levels of a house, not to a house in general with multiple floors.\n7: Based on the definitions above, 'above floor' would be an appropriate response.", "answer": "A: suitcase"}

Among all the options, only B: defense, D: cease fire and E: defend could be applied to the situation.\n4. However, defending is actually not synonymous with ending. So E: defend can be eliminated. \n5. It would be more accurate to say that a successful surprise attack would end defending. \n6. Choice B: defense is misused here. 'Defense' refers to the act or function of defending; it does not mean defense is successfully completed as an action ends when it is successfully completed.\n7.

The next rule out is the resort option because there is no mention of shops.\n6. The remaining options are the seaside town and the ocean, so it all depends now on whether the answer is a place or an entity.\n7. We can eliminate the seaside town option because the phrase \"this\" is referring to something specific. Even if it was a seaside town before, it must now be a tourist attraction.\n8. Therefore that leaves us with the ocean as the answer.\n9. It could refer to the ocean itself or what swims in it.\n10. The latter definition could work.

The others may be leaders in other respects, but they're not leaders to begin with, since they are supposed to be following him.\n6. Option B: was athletic does not apply because while this may be a reason that boys would look up to him, the fact that he was followed implies that he was followed in his non-athletic endeavors.\n7.

'Rush' usually refers to a burst of energy or quick movement. It doesn't mean that someone falling will result in an explosion.\n5. Being led to either E: explode or D: rush is therefore a possibility too.\n6. E: explode would be a reasonable answer for this question if the context was scientific, such as in a lab.

Also, it's very far way and unlikely that saucepans will be transported from Georgia to the kitchen because of it.\n6) B: the south pole is also unlikely to be the correct choice as it is an unlikely way to store a saucepan.

{"idx": 512, "text": "1) The question is about a feeling someone might have towards someone else.\n2) The feeling is one of antipathy.\n3) Other options are unfeeling, negligence, indifferent, and rapport.\n4) These are not applicable because the feeling one should have towards someone that they do not care about and wish to fail as related to a lack of affective concern and not just a lack of attention.   \n5) Unfeeling and negligence are insufficient. They mean the act of not being affectionate or not being concerned enough, not that the person wishes the other person to fail.\n6) Indifference is insufficient because it means to be neither favourable nor unfavourable, it does not apply here. For instance if someone feels indifferent about the neighbour, they may not care enough to mow the lawn if their neighbour does it.\n7) Rapport is an insufficient option because it describes a good feeling between two or more people, not a feeling of antipathy, which is what the question is asking about.\n8) Therefore, the answer is C: antipathetic.\nSo the final is C: antipat\n\nInput: How is the answer to this riddle found? Choices:  C: riddle D: answer E: correct F: wrong\nOutput: 1). This question calls for a comprehension of context and the phrasing of the riddle. The word 'wrong' is inappropriate here because the question does not ask for the 'wrong' answer, it asks for the answer to the riddle, which is a correct answer. \n2. 'Wrong', though it can mean incorrect or inaccurate, is not the appropriate term here.\n3. Similarly, answering 'answer' or 'answer of the riddle' can be incorrect because the answer to the riddles of this type can often be a person or a thing. The phrasing of the riddles can be like such \"Where do we find the answer to our question?\" - \"In the answer\".\n4. Although 'answer' and 'answer of the riddles' can be included in a list of possible answers, 'wrong' is incorrect.\n5. Hence, it can be excluded from the choices, leaving 'answer', 'correct', and 'wrong'.\n6.", "answer": "C: antipathy"}
{"idx": 516, "text": "1. This question calls for understanding of the specific context in which the response will be provided.\n2. There is only one type of entertainment referred to in the sentence which is listed in the set of answers.\n3. All the available options represent types of entertainment except fairground, which doesn't provide entertainment as such but provides rides.\n4. Among the choices, we eliminate choices A: theatre, B: fairgrounds, and D: show as they don't provide rollercoasters or ferris wheels.\n5. Considering only C: friend'shouse and E: casino, it is more likely that the answer is C: friend's location than it is that the answer is E: casino. C: friend's home would imply that the \"I\" is providing the entertainment in place of their friends, while E: casino refers to an establishment as opposed to a location, which wouldn't make sense for entertainment purposes.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is C: friend house", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}
{"idx": 520, "text": "1) Given the options, 'auditioning' doesn't seem to make much sense here. The choice A: auditioning would be when someone listens to music as a form of judgement. In musical terms, the term audition is used to refer to an attempt to get accepted for a musical part.\n2) While 'hearing sounds' is not incorrect, it's not enough to determine the correct answer by itself, since 'hearing sounds' can also mean to listen to music or to hear in a medical terms.\n3) The option C: listening music is not the reason for 'listening a person who is playing the guitar', which implies you are listening to sounds that are being produced from the instrument. Moreover, an instrumental performance cannot be considered as 'listening to music'. The choice is therefore not C: listening to music.\n4) Option D: making music or Making music is incorrect because when two people listen to the performance someone is making they are only hear the sounds they produce. They are not the ones who are making music because they only hear and not the ones who are performing them. \n5) So the correct choice here is between E: arthritic and A: auditioning. Choosing the former would require a shift in the sentence to ensure the question is logically correct. The sentence would only be correct if the person in the performance is not an expert in playing the instrument.\n6) So now that we already know that the choice is between E: arhritic and C: listening to music we do the reasoning: \n7) The only reason why a person would be \"listening to music\" is because of music they are listening to, in other words is because of sounds they produce as a result of music they are listening. But this doesn't explain why someone would be \"watching a person who is playing an instrument\".\n8) So the correct choice must be E: arhritis. If any choice other than A: auditioning was correct, then the sentence itself must be rephrased so that it is both grammaticaly correct and logically sound.\nSo the final choice is E: arthritics\n\nInput: What time would I avoid taking a shower to save water and save electricity?

Choices: 1. Firstly, let us try to understand the meaning of the words in the question.\n2. The words \"event\" and \"witnessed\" are the most important part to focus on.\n3. \"Event\": an occurrence or occurrence of a particular kind.\n4. \"Witnessed\": an act of seeing or watching.\n5. Therefore as per the given words\n6. the event that is happening but is not being witnessed is the event that is not being seen.\n7. From here let us eliminate the first three choices.\n  * a: An event that is happening but not actually being witnessed cannot be described as an event that is finished, because it is ongoing.\n  * b: An event that is ongoing cannot be described as an occurrence that hasn't happened yet because it is in progress.\n  * c: An event that is in progress (which means it is happening) cannot be described as an ongoing occurrence that has not occurred yet.\n8. The remaining choices describe what is happening.\n9. Choice A is correct.\nSo the correct answer is A: ongoing\n\nInput: It wasn't good to be displeased by the bad joke, but the person who had made the joke could choose to be what? Choices:1.

They are asking what actions they can take to listen to music when they don't already have the means of doing so.\n3. There are 5 options: play piano, fiddle, have fun, skate, play piano. \n4. 'Have fun' cannot be the correct choice if the inquirer wants to listen to music. \n5. 'play piano' seems quite odd for an inquirer asking about 'listening to music' as it is unlikely something the inquirer wants, as there is no indication the inquirer is asking for information about playing the piano.\n6. 'fiddle' is an old-fashioned music term that does not seem to fit the inquirer' language that is more modern.\n7. Hence, the correct choice must be E: do so without doing anything.\nSo the final choice E, which says 'do something without doing or not doing anything.\n\nInput: What isn't one of the most useful or important things people can do to have the most enjoyable life? Choices: 1. A: eat well 2. B: travel 3. C: be successful 4. D: have good relationships E: be creative\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the things which will be the MOST useful of all, hence, this eliminates options A, B and D. \n2) Option C, while not bad, is not the most important thing to be successful overall.\n3) This leaves us with options E and E. Both good and useful choices, however only Option E is better.\nSo the final solution is E.", "answer": "D: play piano"}
{"idx": 532, "text": "1) There is not much of reasoning needed here: the phrase \"'chicken did this in a joke\" cannot refer to 'laying eggs' because that's what the chicken's are actually supposed to do. This is the opposite of what makes for a joke. \n2) The phrase \"chicken did this in joke\" cannot refer \"to eating\" or \"becoming food\" because chicken in jokes are eaten by someone else, not by that same chicken that features in a joke.\n3) There is not much logic that 'crossing roads' is something that can be associated with chickens because that is not what chicken would do typically.\n4) \"Looking for cars\" would not make sense in this context because a chicken would not be looking for cars but rather for food and safety.\n5) The phrase \"chickens did this in jokes\" cannot refer to \"laying eggs\" because again, they are supposed to lay eggs.\n6) So the only choice that makes sense is A: \"produce eggs.\"\nSo the final answer to this question is A: produce eggs\n\nInput: What animal has over 5000 legs? Choices: 1. A: Beetle 2. A: Fly 3. A: Spider 4. A: Mouse 5. A: Rabbit 6. A: Turtle 7. A: Horse\nOutput: 1.) \n1. This question calls us to identify an animal that has over 50 legs. The answer does not concern legs per se. It involves legs in plural, to indicate \"more than 1\".\n2. \"More than 1\" might relate to a group, a family, a type, a plurality, etc.\n3. In this context, it seems we aren't supposed to consider one animal that has many individual legs, like a centipede with 50 individual legs per body segment.\n4. Rather, we need to identify an entire family of animals whose members have many legs, or whose members are collectively known for having many legs. This is how the question might be interpreted.\n5. A turtle is an animal, but it only has 2 legs which is a countable number.\n6. A baboon, for certain, is not the case,", "answer": "D: cross road"}
{"idx": 536, "text": "1 and 2. Reasoning:\n3. The phrase \"one way to relieve your...\" indicates the answer has to be a specific activity.\n4. Although the question does not specify, it's not about how to relieve hunger in general; rather, it is about the activity in question, \"grill,\" \"go to market\" or \"eat hamburger\" has to be one that allows people to relieve their hunger. \n5. Grilling food is a common way to enjoy a meal, especially if one's hunger is not severe.\n6. \"Going to the market\" means that the user is going somewhere with a large supermarket, a concept alien to coastal dwellers. In addition, the user is not just bringing home food with them at the end of the day, but foods that can be grilled. \n7. \"Bringing home a fish\" involves acquiring a live fish to cook in a manner most similar to \"grilling,\" but is still too abstract for the given context.\n8. \"Making bread\" is not a way to relieve hunger. \n9. From the context of the question and options, this leaves \"eat hamburgers\" as the answer.\n\n10. Aside from being a type of food, hamburgers are also typically grilled, making this a good option.\n11. In addition, they are sold at supermarkets which is another key difference from fish, so a supermarket can be more easily located in the neighborhood by the sea.\n12. Therefore, the full answer is E: \"Eat hamburgers from the supermarket\".\nSo the final answer was E: eat hamburgers from supermarket \n\nInput: We saw one of these after the airline pilot landed.

It's not possible to see the \"one of these\" after the airline pilot has already landed.", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}
{"idx": 540, "text": "1.'Fixed' here means to repair or correct faults or problems.\n2. When a shelf shows signs of instability, it means the shelf or the frame of the shelf is not strong enough to support objects on it.\n3. So the question relates to a potential solution to the instability problem and, more importantly, to whether the potential solution applies to the specific context.\n4. It's unlikely anyone would repair a shelf by applying it to another building or fixing it to another object.\n5. It's also unlikely to fix a floor shelf or a wall shelf.\n6. Hence, all these options are invalid.\n7. Option A: 'roof' doesn't make sense either.\n8. Option B: corner is invalid too.\n9. Option C:'school building' - this option does not make sense either.\n10. Option D: 'wall' - the same reason as option C.\n11. Option E: 'cupboard' is invalid since it does not apply here at all.\n12. By process of elimination, option E is the only viable answer.\nSo the correct answer is E: cupboard\n\nInput:I have a broken pipe, so what should I do? Choices:  [A] replace it B: cover it C: repair it D: drain it E: drain water\nOutput: 1: The option, I have a broken pipe, leads us to assume that there is an available solution to the problem in that particular instance, i.e. replace, cover, or fix it.\n2. Replacing the pipe is not a solution to a problem where there is no problem in the first place. \n3. Repairing the pipe is not a viable solution in the presence of a broken pipe.\n4. So B: 'cover' would have to be the correct choice.\nSo the correct choice is B: Cover It\n\nInput: The car is on the top of the hill, and where will the ball bounce?

D: medals is also unlikely since the man is only playfully wrestling with the woman he is enamored with.\n2. Among B C and E, there is no blood involved in playful wrestling - C is eliminated. \n3.

It\u2019s obvious that a 4,000-mile radius would be considered huge by many standards.\n2. C: extremely, is also unlikely since 4,00 miles can be considered huge to some extent of being enormous in its own sense.\n2. D: huge, is also unlikely to be the answer. A 4,00 mile radius falls within the same range of huge as extreme.\n3. E: no big deal, is out as well. The use of the wording indicates that a 4,400-mile radius is significant enough to be considered huge.\n4. This leaves us with one choice: B: enormous. \n5.

From the choices that remain, there are two possible scenarios for why there aren't any smaller cabins available: either B: spacecraft is larger than A: villa, or A: villa is smaller than B: spacecraft.\n3. A: villa is smaller since a spacecraft is a type of villa. The answer \"is upgraded to\" is referring to the original intention of obtaining a different type of accommodation.\n4.

Choices:  Folded, drawers, on display, washing machine, closet\nOutput: The question refers to finding a specific object in a specific location. This requires deductive reasoning.\n1. To determine the answer, we must look at the information given.\n2. We remove the irrelevant options, as:\n3. A. 'folded' indicates the item was folded after purchase, which is inconsistent with a mother finding it.\n4. C. 'was on display' indicates the item was purchased during a sale or at a flea market, both of which are inconsistent with a mother's gift.\n5. E. 'is in the washing machine' indicates the item is dirty, but that doesn't seem like it would be a concern since it is a new shirt the mother found for her.\n6. This narrows down B and D to possible locations as they represent new purchase and already owned purchase respectively.\n7. Furthermore, only B and D could be 'on display'.\n8. We rule A as it is an irrelevant type of search location.\n9. The answer is 'is in the closet'. The closet is a designated location where personal belongings are kept.\nSo the final solution is D: closet\n\nInput: As the boat was floating on a calm lake, the people were not thinking of what?

Even if the student was late, but the professor took roll call to get the names of all students, then this student must answer; otherwise he cannot be the only one answering. Therefore option A is incorrect answer. Also if the student was hiding, it doesn't matter whether or not the professor would ask the question, he still has to answer.

If it was beach sand, the crab should have moved freely.\n8) The option that should be eliminated is option B: beach sand.\n9) We are left with options A: tide pool and D: tidepools.\n10) Now, we need to apply reasoning.\n11) Tide pools have water. The crab is scuttling but strains - it seems that he cannot move freely.\n12) A tide pool is also a collection of tide pools. Multiple tide pools are likely within one tide pool and that the crab was trying to move from one tide pool to another.\n13) Therefore, the crab is trying to move from one pool to another at the edge of the land. He could not manage it.\n14) Since in this option, tide pools mean a collection of pools, we need to understand what stops the crest from moving between them.\n15) We may eliminate option E: cooking pot because it is too far-fetched.\n16) We may eliminate option D: tidepoop because it is not an acceptable response.\n17) We can understand what the tide pools mean as we know they have water and that the crab cannot move freely.\n\n18) We can understand that this friction is acting against the current of the water in the tide pools.\n19) Therefore, the answer should be A: tide pool.\n\nInput: The young girl was playing with the ball when she missed her catch, what was it?

If a prejudice comes into the picture, then it means to hold back an informed opinion without any bias or judging.\n6- The phrase 'Judging pigs' would mean evaluating them against each other. The option 'Eliminating' could seem to be an acceptable choice of answer as it means throwing away or removing unwanted pigs that are not of good breed. But, this option cannot be chosen as judging pigs requires being careful.\n7- The option 'Careful' makes sense as if pigs are not of good quality then they should be eliminated from the competition.\n8- The option 'Caring' is out of context.\n9- 'Carefully' means to do something safely, not to avoid judging animals that are of good quality\n10- The option 'Closely' makes sense that if an assessment is not accurate, then one cannot go further.\n11- The phrase 'carefully what..' cannot be correctly answered if the option 'Closely'.\n12- Considering all the information given above, only the option 'Judging', with close meaning can be the answer.\nSo the correct answer is A: Careful\n\nInput:It is important for the farmer to have good fences, what can damage them?

The context for the question is one where all seats in a vehicle have been full, meaning a driver or passenger is not available to take the shopping bag with them.\n3. The options are B: storage cabinet, C: car trunk, D: retail store, E: home.\n3. The first two options both refer to different ways in which one could store a shopping bag, but they are specific to particular locations.\n3. The other three options refer to different places where one can store a shopping in general and, as such, are not specific to locations. \n4. Storage cabinets are not a relevant option as one typically does not carry shopping bags into one's storage cabinet.\n5. Likewise, the car trunk is a storage compartment and is not typically where one would put shopping bags. Hence, this option is redundant.\n6. Retail stores sell goods/items including shopping bags, but they don't carry them.\n7. Hence, D: retail stores doesn't make the cut.\n8. So, the answer is C: car trunk.\n9. You could put the shopping bag in the car trunk and store other items in the car trunk as well.\nSo the final option is choice: C: car truck\n\nInput: What will you find in a doctor's office?

We can thus eliminate B & C.\n4) Moving on to emotions, our feeling might suggest some level of anger - option A: self pity can be ruled out as that might indicate sadness. We can also eliminate options D: embarrassment and E: communicating, as these are actions that we might use to express our feelings.\n5) Finally, option B: communication is the only viable choice since there is no other way to convey physical pain other than through yelling.\nSo the final correct answer is B: communication. \n\nInput: What's in common between a person riding on a bicycle and one riding on a horse?

Therefore our answer choices are limited to completing sentences and completing speeches.\n5. We eliminate option B: complete sentences, as it is only one of the two types of speech a speech therapist can complete. \n6. Option D is incorrect because speech therapists are not expected or trained to complete sentences in general, they are specialised to provide speech therapy.\n7.

Since James is cooking his own s stew,  restaurants are out.\nb) casserole - A casserole is a pot or a pan. Again, it is not used to cook s stew.\nc) Root cellar - A root cellar is a storage space that can be underground or at ground level. A root cellar is used to store fruits, vegetables, and also non-perishable food. However, a root cellar cannot contain meat, fish, or poultry, which cannot be used for s stew. Hence, as potatoes are used with vegetables, they are not found in root cellars. Thus, root cellars can be eliminated.\nd) Pockets - Potatoes found in a person's pocket could be used to cook s stews. Pockets can be in a person's clothing or a purse containing several compartments.

Therefore, by process elimination, the choice C: cool down is best.\n4. An option is D: dropping quickly which can refer to temperature going down, but 'quickly' is vague, so it can also refer to slow change as long as the temperature drops overall. So this question can be answered in multiple ways, making it a poor option.\n5. Choice E: heat up is also eliminated since it refers to temperature rise.\n6.

B is the 2nd letter of the alphabet hence is required. F-J are all redundant since those letters are already accounted for by having the letter B, H, M, and N.

A: shoes can be used for running, which contradicts the question.\n 2. B: running would refer to something like sprinting versus running on a regular basis.

Therefore we can eliminate the option'say you're welcome'.\n5. \"express gratitude\",'shake hands', and 'appreciate compliment' could be possible responses to a compliment, but the option in the choices, \"smile\" is more likely as a response to a compliment. \n6. \"Appreciate compliment\" sounds passive and impersonal to the listener.\n7. \"Express gratitude\" sounds more likely than \"Shake hands\" because this action could be confusing, and could be mistaken for a greeting, instead of a show of gratitude.\n8. However, \"smile\" sounds the most obvious and direct action.\n9. Hence, \"smile\" makes the most sense.\nSo the final answering would be A: smile\n\nInput: If I wanted to thank someone by expressing gratitude, what could I do? Choices:\" A: say you're happy\" B: shake hands\" C: say I'm grateful\" D: say thank you\" E: say your welcome\nOutput: 1: If the question asks to suggest something that is typically done when 'expressing gratitude', we should consider what a typical response to gratitude would entail. \n2: The phrase 'expressing gratitude' indicates that it is the sender of gratitude who is trying to express their appreciation. \n3: We know that gratitude is also typically expressed by saying 'thank you'. \n4: Hence,'saying thank you' would be the most appropriate response to using when expressing gratitude. \n5: In relation to saying thanks, we can also eliminate 'I'm good' and'sir' because, although there is an element of thanking there, it's also conveying an element of respect. \n6: Hence, while saying'sir' is pol", "answer": "D: say you're welcome"}

The book contains all the necessary information which can be applied to \"operations with numbers\", which is why the option that leads here is B: phone book.\n3. However, phone book is an outlier among other options.\n4. \"Statistic\" and \"music school\" both are not relevant contexts.\n5. Hence, eliminating phone book, we have to look at the context.\n6. Among options, \"math book\" and \"office\", \"office\" context is a less likely scenario as we are not talking about numbers which involve operations, rather we are talking about numbers which have operational value itself.\n7.

The star's four rocky planets and four gaseous planets is unlikely to be a part of any constellation since a constellation consists of only 8 or fewer stars, which is much fewer than the number of planets mentioned.\n2. The star probably belongs to one of the galaxies in the night sky, since it has been orbiting for about 12 billion years, and so belongs to the same galaxy where it has been.\n3. Similarly, the star was probably not part of Hollywood, as there seems to be no relevance to Hollywood in the context. \n4. Neither can we say that the star was part of a constellation, a galaxy or the night sky, since all these three are large-scale entities involving a collection of stars.\n5. The star was part of a solar system. A solar system refers to all planets circling around one star/sun.\n6. For example, our own solar system consists of planets like Earth, Venus, Mars, etc. which all remain within the same area in the universe, and move in parallel orbits around our sun. \n7.

C and D are too specific in their descriptions of what the children did after being struck or after they enjoyed seeing Superman.\n4. B is also too specific in that it implies that the children watched while Superman flew directly above them. If that was the case, they would have said it.\n5.

Choices: 1. A: nothing 2. B: provides leverage 3. C: is a protective casing 4. D: offers added control 5. E: offers comfort\nOutput: Reason: 1. A toothpick doesn't do anything for a toothbrush, it is not attached or related to it.\n2. A toothpick provides leverage-the ability to move an object, a toothbrush for example-with force.\n3. A toothpick is not a protective casing for a toothbrus- it does not cover or encase the toothbrush.\n4. A toothpick would provide added control, that is, would be an extra, convenient way to hold the toothbrush in place, rather than providing additional brushing control.\n5. A toothpick could offer comfort- a soothing, cool sensation from the end used to brush teeth.\n6. Therefore, the most likely option is C: offers comfort.\nSo the final option is C: offers added control\n\nInput: Which of the following words is NOT on a totem pole?

The question asks about what it meant that the little girl asked a question.\n2). Let's look at the choices:\n3) Option A) the right answer\n4). Usually, asking a question indicates the attempt to find out or learn something, usually an answer. This indicates that the girl, most likely, has the wrong answer or cannot complete the exercise, so she asked a question.\n5) Option B) to help from a friend\n6). It's unlikely that the question was to get help, since in this case a friend would be available in class and would not need to ask any questions to find the right answer.\n7) Option C) argue with her teacher\n8). This option is unlikely since it's unlikely for a child to have an argument with their teacher.\n9) Option D) to get out of class\n10). In this case, the context could mean that the girl asked her question to try to get out of class; however, the girl asked a question that led her classmates to the answer.\n11) Option E) avoid confusion\n12).

{"idx": 784, "text": "1-2) Let's reason from first principles: One's physical ability or strength is not usually used to refer to a person as a \"child\".\n3) Also, as we move from the first principle, let's eliminate options that are unlikely: A: His physical disability did have an impact on his strength. Though he might not have been physically strong, if he did not have a physical disability, he definitely would have been a physically capable person, and would not be referred to as a child. Therefore, option A can be eliminated.\n4) Let's move on to consider the other options.\n5-8) A: B: C: D: Even if the person's physical disability did not affect one's brain, the term 'childlike' does not refer to intelligence. Since option D: competence deals with intelligence, this would be relevant to the question if the person did not have a physical ability. We, however, know that the person does not have a physical ability as we have deduced in step 3.\n9-12) In terms of potential or qualification, 'childlike' does refer to the person's lack of experience or his/her immaturity, but this is not the context of the question and we know that.\n13-15) Finally, we eliminate all the remaining options since they, too, all revolve around physical ability, implying that 'childlike' refers to the impact of the person's physical ability on his/her experience.\n16-18) The answer to the question becomes clear: His physical disability had nothing to do with his lack of experience/maturity as suggested by the phrase 'childlike'.

The drought was probably due to California having an extreme water shortage, which means the pool would not have been in California or anywhere in California. 2.

The swimming pool must be located somewhere in YMCA, because it is there that they cannot refill it due to drought regulation. 5. The YMCA is made up of multiple facilities: there are many YMCAs in California alone. 6. There is a California Drought Resource Center. 7. This leaves us with California, YMCA, or a single YMCA in California. 8. The California Drought Resource Center exists solely in the state, which brings us back to California being the answer. \nSo the final answer could be A: ymca, and also we could say: California, YMCA is where the drought occurred, and YMCA (meaning all of them) is where the pool was located.\n\nInput: My husband, after 7 years of marriage has found religion.

{"idx": 796, "text": "1, At first glance, the question appears ambiguous because each choice can be interpreted in several ways. But there are a few clues that can help narrow down the choices.\n2. The second sentence of the sentence says, \u201cWhat do you do when you are feeling happy?\u201d In contrast to the first sentence, the wording here is very natural and there are no grammatical errors.\n3. This means that the person who is feeling satisfied could end up boarding a ship as well as grocery shopping.\n4. However, these actions do not fit the context as they might not be performed by someone who is feeling satisfied, and it is more likely that a happy person would shout at someone rather than feeling happy themselves.\n5. Based on this info, we can eliminate choices A and E. \n6. As a result, B, C and D can all fit the context.\n7. If the person is feeling happy, he might cross the street to go to a different place.\n8. Similarly, the person might also grocery shop for something that could make him happier.\n9. Therefore, the answer could be either B: grocery shopping or C: crossing street.\n10. Option D: \"feeling happy\" is also a possible choice, but the person may be satisfied rather than happy. The phrase is vague and could indicate satisfaction rather than happiness.\n11.

It is apparent that'strategy' and 'places for storing my chess pawn' are two words or concepts that don't make sense together.\n5. So, the most appropriate answer is C: toy store.

Although possible for small creatures to live in wooded areas such as forests, the question appears to be referring to the habitat range of beavers, rather than smaller woodland creatures or insects.\n7. Option B: Body of water.\n8. According to common knowledge, the habitat of beavers is near water.\n9. There is some ambiguity to options B and C, but we can continue to understand them further as it seems that either bodies of saltwater or freshwater are possible, based on other facts we will learn about in subsequent sections.\n10.

Choices: 1. A: an arrival 2. B: to do something else 3. C: another time 4. D: the fact that something is coming 5. E: that nothing is going to happen\nOutput: 1: Option 1, \"an arrival\", is unlikely in this context. An arrival can only be something real, and not something conceptual. 2. Option 2, \"to do another thing\", is also unlikely because this indicates that there is definitely something coming. 3. Option 3, \"another time\" is also unlikely, because how could waiting indicate that another time will happen? It's much more likely that waiting indicates that nothing is going to arrive, but something might happen later. 4. Option 4, \"the fact that something is coming\", seems a bit more likely here. Waiting means that something will arrive, and there is no question of what type of thing it is. The correct answer is 4.\n\nInput:", "answer": "D: exchange"}
{"idx": 856, "text": "1.\"Roving bands of monsters\" are a fictional creature found in movies or novels, not in real life. \n2. As such, the phrase would be most likely to cause a reaction of mass hysteria, where a large part of the population would believe a monster is attacking their community. But the other answer options could also be correct, as long as they are not found in movies or fictional accounts. \n3. In modern day, 'getting in trouble' and'murder' would not be possible reactions to rumors of monsters. \"Going to prison\" is not the right phrase for this context. \n4. The phrase \"rumors of roving bands\", which makes up the entire sentence, suggests that rumor is what leads to a reaction, and not the monster itself. \n5. Based on this, it is most likely that \"rumors of rooving bands of monsters killing\" would cause \"mass hysteria\". \n6. So the final answer is B.\nSo the final choice is B: mass hysteria\n\nInput: When someone says \u201cit's too hot\u201d, why do we usually need a blanket? Choices: 1. A: because you're cold 2. B: because your bed doesn't have a blanket already on it 3. C: because your air-conditioning is out 4. D: because you're sleepy 5.

A: Singing doesn't really apply because people aren't usually expected to start singing on their own during the course of waiting, they'll sing when it is their turn.\n3. B: Getting bored is certainly possible, but not always, so it's not necessarily an inevitable result of waiting, especially if people know they are going to receive what they've been waiting for after a reasonable amount of time.\n4. C: worrying can be a result of waiting, but it isn't guaranteed.\n5. D: waiting for something (especially for a relatively long time) can be very frustrating for many, and they can start to complain and complain when they don't get it, so people sometimes sing or shout when they get impatient.\n6.

{"idx": 864, "text": "1 This question requires some level of deduction. \n2. An answer has to be either A: something that is not satisfying or B: something that is not sufficient.\n3. Satisfaction is a subjective evaluation of what a thing provides for the consumer that satisfies a need or desire. \n4. Unnecessary items are those that are not needed but have no other purpose either. Hence, answer A) Satisfaction would be an incorrect answer\n5. Insufficient items are those that are needed to fulfill a certain need but are actually not enough. \n6. Therefore answer B) Unnecessary is incorrect.\n7. Answer C): Luxury items need to be evaluated based on what is needed. If a person feels a certain need, then the thing is necessary for that need. If an item is actually not needed for that need but a person chooses to purchase it because of the appeal and/or status of it, then the item has become a luxury. Hence, the correct option would be Answer C) Luxury.  \n8. Answer E: Extra. This is when you buy a specific item and feel like you need more even though you actually don't need it. \n9.

The options that clearly would not work are '1) same', '2) face' and '4) left side'. \n1.'same' would be the same side of the coin rather than the opposite. 2. 'face' as a term is used to describe the front side, so it would be wrong to say that it faces the other side. \n3. In this case you cannot have the same thing on the left and right side. It is either or, one side has to be different from the other to mean opposite.  \n4. If it was 'left side', there would not be a right side at all, or there would be two opposite sides. \n5. The side with the head on it is not always opposite to the other side", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

'Pay bills' and 'face each other' both seem to be relevant because the first answer is likely to be 'paying debts', and the payment of bills is often a form of meeting as a group, and a person's face is the way one's identity can be recognised by others. \n4. Hence, based on reasoning the possible alternatives, 'pay bills' and 'do face to face' are the only sensible options that make sense here. \n5. Therefore the answer is C: pay bills and face each other.\nSo the final answers are C: pay bills, and face each other", "answer": "C: group together"}

The verb 'immediately lead to' suggests an instruction to perform some activity right after exercising, such as doing some relaxing. The options that are'relaxation' and 'use energy' are reasonable.\n2. Exercise, being something that requires lots of energy, can be considered 'an activity that uses energy'.\n3. Exercising 'lead to' either 'exhaustion' or 'energetic', as they are the result of exercising.\n4. To answer the question, we have to rule out all reasonable options other than'relaxation' and use energy'.\n5. Since energy can be 'used' in many ways.

Since a hand is a much smaller surface area than a cupboard, chocolate, coffee, and candy bar are all much smaller than these.\n3. As for soda pop and sugar, they both go into cupped hands to drink and are liquid so the cupboard would not hold much soda or sugar.\n4. Also a sugar cube fits perfectly in a hand.\n5. The best answer would be the one we feel is the most likely answer.\n6. As for A:  cupboard, the largest thing that would fit in there would be a soda or a bag of cookies or chips.\n7. The cupboard would be able to hold some chocolate and candy bars, \n8. but these items are not food.\n9. So it's not the best choice.\n10. We can also eliminate D: candy bar because it is still liquid and B: chocolate since you would have to break it in two to fit it. \n11. So it comes down to between A: cupboard and E: soda pop. Soda pop is most likely and the right answer would be A: cupboard. \n12.

Choices:  A list B workout plan C Monday D Tuesday\nOutput: 1: The question requires logical reasoning.\ni. The question specifically mentions that \"it was the last thing on our list for Tuesday\" because exercise is a regular activity or something that is supposed to be planned, and not something unexpected.\nii. The phrase 'it was the last thing' can be applied to things of the list, which are in order according to their position\niii. The phrase 'on the list' means the items are in order, so each of them must be listed on the first day, the second day and so on.\niv. So, 'it was the last' cannot be applied without understanding the order.\n2. We have to eliminate answer choices that do not comply with the context.\ni.", "answer": "D: candy bar"}

Only options A and C indicate the student acting in the moment to benefit from the speaker.\n6. Hence, the answer must be either A or C.\n7. Since the student is asking for clarification in the sentence, the professor does not expect the student to do anything except listen. By not taking notes or paying attention to the test while listening, the student is potentially hurting his/herself later by not benefiting from the lecture. \n8. Hence, we need to differentiate between immediate and later gains.\n9. Immediate gains can be gained by taking notes or focusing, while later gains will come mainly by listening carefully.\n10. Hence, \"take notes\" and \"focus\" indicate later gains, which the student should look after on his/her own after the speech.\n11. Since \"gain experience\" and \"take notes\" can both indicate later gains, they are mutually exclusive.\n12. So, we can eliminate \"gain experience\" from the options, as well as \"focus\" as in the student has to \"attend to what is being said in order to benefit from it later.\"\n13.

The answer must be B: In the graveyard. People in the past used ice to cool their drinks, so they might bury broken iceboxes in graveyards to commemorate the dead during summers.\n4. However, as iceboxes are no longer in use, there are less and less iceboxes to dispose off, so the frequency of people burying iceboxes in graves is decreasing.\n5.

Doctors perform surgery in hospitals and surgical centers; they don't use operating rooms on top of buildings. However, that is probably not a common reason for someone to want to find a specific surgical room.\n2.) Underground isn't where doctors perform surgeries, either.\n3.) City centers aren't necessarily hospitals, at least not as I'm familiar. A city isn't a building, it's a collection of buildings.\n4.) The answer must be home or hospital. Doctors can perform surgeries at either place, and those are the only two places where you'd find doctors performing surgeries.\n5.) The final choice of the bunch is C.

The question asks to identify the person's \"actions\".\nReason Two:\nThis question can be interpreted in two different ways. It could either mean to identify a specific action the person does, which would then have relevance to how they do not understand him well, or it could be more general where the answer is related to a general action.

Therefore, choice is A.\nSo the final choice is A: cold\n\nInput: You have been asked to design a website for a business. What must you do? Choices:  ****  A: have a professional appearance B: be user-friendly C: be creative D: be informative E: be visually appealingF: be free from errors and bugs\nOutput: Reason: 1) The phrase \"be user-friendly\" is a characteristic of a website.\n2) The phrase \"user-friendly\" is synonymous with the phrase \"user-interface\", which is a designation given to the physical characteristics - size, layout, navigation, user interaction, ergonomics, graphics, and typography - that define and determine if a website has an intuitive, enjoyable design for the end user with no learning curve.\n3) Among the choices, \"user-friendly\", \"informative\", and \"user-interface\" can all be categorized here. Therefore, we rule out choices B, D, and F.\n4) Of the remaining choices, A and E are redundant, because any design is bound to be \"professional\", and any design is bound to have to \"be visually appealing\", so A and E can be ruled out.\n5) Choice C seems the least likely because \"creative\" is not a necessary designation given to a website, whereas being \"user-friendly, \"professional\", and \"visually appealing\" is necessary.\n6) Therefore, the answer has to choice D: \"be informative\".", "answer": "E: wet"}
{"idx": 992, "text": "1.) After eliminating the irrelevancies: A: pet shops, B: new mexico - not the most likely location for snake habitat, D: arctic - not the most likely climate for snake habitation.\n2.) The answer could be B: new mexico or C: white house, because the snake would prefer to live in areas where the weather is consistently warm and sunny.\n3.)

However, if the snake is hot-blooded, like the president of the white house, the snake would prefer it a little cooler.\nSo the final answers are B: new mexico and C: white house\n\nInput: I was in the middle of an awesome workout when something happened that made me feel awful. What did it? Choices:  Tip: a) The bar b) The floor c) The floor in front of the bar d) The bar in front of the floor e) The bar in front\nOutput: 1) The question is clearly asking what caused the person to feel awful during a workout.\n2) Out of the given options, we can eliminate B: The floor in front of bar. The floor in front of a bar is a possible cause for a person to feel bad during a workout, not the floor in front of the floor.\n3) We can also eliminate C: The floor. The floor, by itself, is not any more likely to make a person feel awful than anything else. We can eliminate A: The bar. The bar is likely to be used during a workout, but it will usually be the cause of a good workout, not a bad one. \n4) Choices D: The bar in front of floor and E: The bar in front seem to be the most likely to have been the cause of the person going from an awesome workout to feeling terrible.\n\nInput: I've been taking my medicine as long as I've had it, and I don't know what might happen if I stop taking it.

{"idx": 996, "text": "This question requires some reasoning based on context and our understanding of the story in order to extract the correct meaning. \n1. The man could not have \"set the cup on the table\" if he hadn't first had something to \"put it on\" in the place of the coaster.\n2. The word \"coaster\" is used in a sense of \"placeholder\" i.e. to support the cup, so there's no need to break anything.\n3. Therefore, the man had to have the \"tenacity\" to retrieve whatever he had previously put the cup on, and lacked the \"tenacity\" for \"balancing\" the cup.\n4. According to the passage, he didn't \"heave\" anything to put it on (because he didn't have anything with him), and he lacked the necessary \"coasting skills\" to balance the cup on his palm.\n5. For this reason, the correct answer is Choice C: coaster.\nSo the final choice is C: coaster\n\nInput: The cat, on the mat, did what? Choices: A: nothing B: rolled onto stomach C: ate a bird D: scratched E: chased\nOutput: This question is about a story and the events it depicts.\n1. The cat was not doing 'nothing' while it was on the mat, as it performed a physical act of rolling onto its stomach. Therefore, the phrase \"did what\" doesn't describe what the cat was doing on an abstract level, but rather its active physical deed.\n2. 'Scratching' is a behavior that the cat could have performed at any time after it got onto the mat, and it was not necessary to 'roll onto its stomach' to scratch since it was moving and able to do so at any time.\n3. 'Chasing' is an activity that typically refers to one's pursuit of a person or animal, so it is unlikely that the cat (a physical entity itself) was chasing another animal. \n4. 'Caring' could be used to describe the cat's behavior, but the phrase does not directly apply.\n5. 'Eating' is often used to describe the consumption of food, but this doesn't apply to a bird.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is B: rolled onto stumach", "answer": "D: skill"}
{"idx": 1000, "text": "If you are headed to the locker room to get a drink from the place, it makes sense that you started from a place which contains a locker room. \n1. Eliminating options:  A: health clubs do not, in general, contain locker rooms, nor is locker room a term typically used to describe a 'green' drink. \n2. B: no need to go into a stadium with locker rooms to get a drink. \n3. C: fitness centre does not contain locker rooms, it's most likely a place for exercising. \n4. E: gymnasium is likely a more general type of fitness centre or physical activity centre. \n5. So the options which make the most sense are: B: jocks, D: stadium, E: gymnasium\n6. But we will eliminate E: gymnasium, as gymnsiums typically do not contain locker rooms. \n7. Then from B: jocks and D: stadium, we will eliminate B: jocks as it contains an improbable amount of locker rooms. 8. From D: stadium, one can also eliminate D: stadium in general as it's unlikely to contain locker rooms.\n9. Then we are left with two options: D: stadium, and E: gymnasium. \n10. We are now certain that D: stadium contains locker rooms and is therefore a better choice than E: gymnasium.\nSo the final solution is D: stadium\n\nInput: She went to the park earlier, what might she do next? Choices: \nA: go to a festival B: see her friends C: go hiking D: take a walk E: go to the library\nOutput: 1) One should not leave the park as soon as she enters it. 2) 'Later' could mean sometime after she has left the park. Hence, we will eliminate the irrelevant options that do not make sense. 3) Eliminating A: go to a festival as she's been at the park earlier, and that is a better choice for her next activity. 4) Eliminating C: go hiked as there are no cliffs or mountains near a park.5) There are no books, magazines, newspapers, computers, etc. at the", "answer": "A: health club"}

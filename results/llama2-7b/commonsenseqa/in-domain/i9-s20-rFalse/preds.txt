The only difference here is to invert the dictionary with the `lowercase`.**<n><n>### Solution<n>```python<n>import operator<n>

This function takes a two element string (key, value) and returns a function f such that f(0)= key, f(1)= value. (ie, it returns the position of the key in the value. (ie if key="cat", then return 2 (ie, "c", "at"))<n><n>The function should return another function of a single element so that other components don’t have to know about the mapping if the key and value.  To make that really simple, let the function take (key, value, list) as input and return the index (0…(length-1)) of the value in list[value] for the given key in key.<n><n>For example, if the input is (cat, fish, ["dog", "cat"]), then the function should return (dog, 1).<n>If list[value] is not defined, then throw an error.<n><n>NOTE that if it's possible that the key will show up more than once, then you may need to return 0.  ie, for the above example, if (cat, fish, "fish") is a valid input to f, you should return the index of fish in the argument of (fish, "fish", ["dog"]) (because dog is not in the list and doesn't equal fish).<n><n>Remember that the value is always considered to be a string.  So, "fish" in the above example would be compared to itself.<n><n>### Instructions:Write a function called “convert” that takes either a single integer string, two integer strings, or a string of either one or two integers, and returns the number if it's a single string or two integers, otherwise returns the sum (or difference, if two integers) of the two inputs and convert it to a string.<n><n>### Examples:<n>Input: [123, 456]<n>Output: -223<n><n>Input: 123<n>Output: 1230

His family was very poor, they did not have anything to eat and had no home to live in. Benn's mother had promised to buy a tree to build a home from the first money earned. All the animals in the jungle tried to make some money. <n>In the village, a farmer had a large tree that he wanted to fell. <n>One morning, as the day was cool, the farmer went to the jungle near his farm and saw many different animals working. Some were sawing the trunk, others were hacking and others making small cuts into the tree.<n>As the farmer looked, he noticed a monkey who had taken an axe. It was Benn and he was swinging the axe in a way that was very difficult. Benn knew he was not doing it properly, but each time he made a cut into the tree the axe flew from his hand and would break his toes.

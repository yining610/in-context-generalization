His family was very poor, they did not have anything to eat and had no home to live in. Benn's mother had promised to buy a tree to build a home from the first money earned. All the animals in the jungle tried to make some money. \nIn the village, a farmer had a large tree that he wanted to fell. \nOne morning, as the day was cool, the farmer went to the jungle near his farm and saw many different animals working. Some were sawing the trunk, others were hacking and others making small cuts into the tree.\nAs the farmer looked, he noticed a monkey who had taken an axe. It was Benn and he was swinging the axe in a way that was very difficult. Benn knew he was not doing it properly, but each time he made a cut into the tree the axe flew from his hand and would break his toes. Poor Benn did not know what to do. \nAs the farmer watched Benn, he began to laugh so hard that he almost could not control himself. The farmer told Benn that his axe skills were better than it seemed, he could get more money if he sold the axe.

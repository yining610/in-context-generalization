Choices:  N/A  A: airport B: beach C: casino D: hotel E: lounge<n>Output: A: airport<n><n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>This solution used regex to split and extract values from the string.<n><n>* The regex used to check if the given number string is a decimal or not is `[.\d]` This is because this string will begin with a period or dot which will be our check character for the decimal variable.<n>* Then the regex `[,\d]` is used to check if the string also ends with a comma or not.<n>* Finally we take the substring from the variable i.e. if it is the first input, the substring is 42, from variable 1.<n>* For the next input, 03761002 - the substring is `03761` for first input, the substring we take is `1002`.<n>* The same process is performed for the remaining two inputs to get the substring value which is `4525` - `0.24` and `7775` - `7.77`.<n>* Finally, this substring value is printed using `print()`.<n><n>* First we need to split the string using `\W` to prevent the substrings we take to contain alphabets.<n>* Then regex `.` splits the strings based on `.` which are digits, this means the whole value of the substrings will be of only number and there will be no alphabets which may cause the program to fail.<n>* And regex `[,\d]` will not split the string if it contains  comma or dot as we want to have two substrings for each substring value in the input string.<n>* Finally the substring for input 7775 is `7.77` and using regex we take only the substring value.<n><n>* So here regex split works by splitting the string given in the input variable with one or more occurences of the separator `\W`.<n>

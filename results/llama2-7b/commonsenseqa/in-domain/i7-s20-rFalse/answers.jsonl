This project allows you to develop your machine learning skills using different models - neural network, logistic regression and support vector machine. Read more about the different techniques here:\n\n[Neural Network](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/45568/what-does-neural-network-stand-for-and-how-does-it-work)\n\n[Support Vector Machine](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-a-support-vector-machine-svm/)\n\nThe MNIST data set has been cleaned and rescaled to 5-10% of the data. The resulting data will have 10 features and 102 variables, thus resulting in a 10 dimensional data cube. The data set is divided into 2 sets.\nTrain = 60,000 features and 15888 variables\nTest = 20,000 variables and 102 features\n\nThe dataset is saved in the directory: `mnist/.`\n\n### Objective\nYour objective is to accurately classify the digits of the MNIST data set.\n\n### Input\nThe input to the program is a matrix. Each column of the matrix is a data cube with dimensions:\n  - 10 instances\n  - 64 dimensions\n\nEach column represents the 64 vectors from each training example in the matrix.\n\n### Output\nThe matrix must be converted to the following result format:\n\n  - Labels for each row must be 0 or 1 to indicate whether that row label is label 0 or 1\n  - For each row you must also assign a corresponding confidence interval for the label prediction\n  - The matrix must have the same height as the given matrix (102 columns) but will have two additional columns for labels and confidence intervals\n\nThe output is saved in your data/output directory. Once the model has been trained you must test the classifier on the testing dataset (test dataset will be 80% of the", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

Choices:  N/A  A: airport B: beach C: casino D: hotel E: lounge\nOutput: A: airport\n\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis solution used regex to split and extract values from the string.\n\n* The regex used to check if the given number string is a decimal or not is `[.\\d]` This is because this string will begin with a period or dot which will be our check character for the decimal variable.\n* Then the regex `[,\\d]` is used to check if the string also ends with a comma or not.\n* Finally we take the substring from the variable i.e. if it is the first input, the substring is 42, from variable 1.\n* For the next input, 03761002 - the substring is `03761` for first input, the substring we take is `1002`.\n* The same process is performed for the remaining two inputs to get the substring value which is `4525` - `0.24` and `7775` - `7.77`.\n* Finally, this substring value is printed using `print()`.\n\n* First we need to split the string using `\\W` to prevent the substrings we take to contain alphabets.\n* Then regex `.` splits the strings based on `.` which are digits, this means the whole value of the substrings will be of only number and there will be no alphabets which may cause the program to fail.\n* And regex `[,\\d]` will not split the string if it contains  comma or dot as we want to have two substrings for each substring value in the input string.\n* Finally the substring for input 7775 is `7.77` and using regex we take only the substring value.\n\n* So here regex split works by splitting the string given in the input variable with one or more occurences of the separator `\\W`.", "answer": "E: healthy body"}

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:Where would you put a light? Choices:  A: ocean B: desk C: universe D: attic E: chair<n><n>### Response:		The letter "a" is the answer that is correct.<n><n><n>### Rationale:A light is needed above the ocean because the ocean takes up half of the surface of the planet and it should be lit. The rest of the ocean can be lit by the surrounding lights. There is also the problem of the fish and sea mammals getting lost at sea. In addition, there are ships that get lost and in which the majority of people drown. There are also the large sharks. Having all of the oceans lit is a good idea. The desk, universe, and attic are not possible for lights to shine in and for the attic, it would need to be lit from the front or top before a light could shine in. The chair is a bad place for a light because you need to move from side to side to stand in it. In addition, your clothes could get caught in the light and catch on fire.<n><n>### Notes

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:The new kitten hadn't gotten used to what it was allowed to climb on in most rooms, so the owned kept the bedroom door what? Choices:  A: opened B: closed C: found at shower D: falling down E: locked<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct response is : `B` <n>The new kitten hadn’t gotten used to  what it was allowed to get on in most rooms of the house, so the owner kept the bedroom  bedroom door closed. The owner also kept the door on the shower closed. <n><n>### Sample:<n><n>What is the maximum value that 0 may have? (A) None (B) 0 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3<n>The correct response is: `E` <n><n>None. 0 is either zero or false. Zero cannot be one and cannot be anything except zero or false. Because you can add something to something to equal something else (1+1 = 2) and divide something by something to equal something else as well (1/1 = 1), zero can be considered a number. The number 0 is the smallest number and it can never be true. It is false. Zero can be considered a number because the first rule of computer programming, in the BASIC computer language for example, is that zero is a true number and that false is true. Therefore, although you can't add something to zero or divide something by zero, in the computer language, zero is considered a number.  <n><n>### Input<n><n>You don't have to be an expert in C# to take this quiz.<n><n>[![Learn C# the easy way, for free.](http://www.pluralsight.com/pricing/courses?discount=youtube.5.CSharp)](https://www.plurks.com/plurks/learn-easily-c-sharp-quiz-answers-explanations-explained-example-3pZzK)

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:What state shaped like a glove has a lot of farmland? Choices:  A: countryside B: farming areas C: michigan D: texas E: north dakota<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>```java<n>System.out.println("Answer: D");<n>```<n><n><n>## HOW TO:<n><n>### 1. First I use the `Scanner` class which is part of the `java.util.Scanner` class. Using the `next()` method from `Scanner` I can get the input from the user. Then I use a `for` loop to loop through my choices. Once inside of it I use the next token of my choices array which is `chooseChoice` and try to match the `Scanner.next()`. If `equals` returns `true`, then I print the answer.<n><n>### 2. When I read in the choices it is formatted as `String[]` and `String[] choices = {"C", "M", "M", "N", "T", ""};` This then allows me to iterate over the `String[]` and have the `nextToken()` of my `Scanner.next()` matched with the strings in the `String[]`. I do this by putting `Scanner.next(...).equals(...)` within my `for` loop to iterate over it.<n><n><n>### Explanation:

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:The human looked down longingly as he sat in the orbiting space station, what did he miss? Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is the nearest house because in order to be on the space station the human would have had to get on an aeroplane and this is on the ground therefore his feet will likely be on the ground too and he will miss the feeling of the grass on his feet, even though you cannot sense air on your feet in space anyway.<n><n>### Clarification:The choice A is not correct as the human's house probably has no windows and would therefore look just the same as the sky or the clouds outside the space station, also it is likely built on a different planet to the space station so there will be no similarities, although it would have a door to get into and out of.<n><n>### CORRECT/PARTLY CORRECT: If you could walk to the window as you sat in the space station, there would be a similar view between your house and the space station but not a similar feeling to be able to stand on grass.<n>You are here because you are sitting in an office block not because you are on one leg on the space station. <n><n>### Output:The human looked down, longingly, as he sat in the space station. What did he miss? Choice is letter A, The nearest house is correct. A choice of any of the other letters. <n><n>## Solution:This is the text that describes how to write the solution to the task and explains all concepts and variables you must include.<n><n>### Multiple answers:<n><n><n>## Solution:<n>You are required to write a solution that describes how to complete the instruction. <n><n>## Output:<n><n><n>## Output:If the human was to get a window on his ship so he could see houses he could do this even though he could not stand on any, just like if he had a picture of your house it would not feel the same as looking at the real thing.

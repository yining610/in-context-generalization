You will code the function so that it is<n>able to calculate your total number of stops when travelng an arbitrary distance between 2 points.  <n>* It is not possible to write one function to solve the problem in all cases. This means you will have to<n>develop code that accounts for the number of stops as well as taking into account that the number of stops could<n>be negative due to backtracking. <n>* Your final function will take the input as two coordinates.  <n>* Return a single int representing the total number of stops needed to travel from origin to destination.  You<n>can think of this as if the traveling car is moving from point x to point y<n>* If the number of stops is negative this means the car had to backtrack and will have this many negative stops.<n>* The first coordinate will be the x coordinate and the second coordinate will be the y  (not latitude and<n>longitude)<n><n>If you are having trouble understanding how to code for the negative number of stops try this:<n><n>**Example:**<n>Given the x coordinates 5, 3<n>Given the y coordinates -2, 2<n><n>You would enter:  5,-2  3,2<n><n>**Expected Output:**<n>3 (Negative number of stops)<n><n>If you want more practice try using your IDE or computer to get more practice.<n><n>Good Luck with coding!<n><n>----------<n><n>## References & Credits<n><n>1.

Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n>## Explore Your Imagery <n><n>During this exercise, please answer each of the following reflection questions. This activity is an exercise in mindfulness intended to help develop awareness of the images that are conjured up when you hear a word and that may help you discover insights about those images. We will not examine the images in much detail.<n><n><n><n>1. What is the first thing you think of when you think of the word "Snake?"<n><n><n>1. The first image you think of when you hear the word "Cup" could be different than the image it conjures for me. What is the first image you think of? Does it differ from what I might think of if I hear the word "CUP" for the first time. <n><n><n>1. Think of a word that would describe the image you generated.<n><n><n>### Your Response:<n>- What is the third image you generate when you see the word "Gift?' <n><n>- Do you have a specific object in mind when you think of these concepts or can you only describe "concepts" rather than a specific object. <n><n>- When you see or use these objects, do you think of them more as symbols (a picture of what a word means), or as a real object you interact with. <n><n>- If you used a specific object, what would you do with it. <n><n>### Review:<n>The term "reification" is used frequently in psychology to refer to "making concrete." An example often cited is the idea that a stereotype is made abstract through a concept and made concrete when it is associated with a particular person. In this exercise, you are encouraged to create images about an emotion concept, like love or anger. <n><n>## What is an Image? <n><n>* How would you define an image? You can use any terms or definitions you choose, but make sure your response provides some type of definition that you can share with members of the class. Write no more than 5 paragraphs (approx. 200 words).  <n><n>### Example:<n>- Here is one definition of an image that I use: "[A]n image is an object which makes its presence felt to the conscious subject by evoking in him or her (1) the immediate experience of a certain content in thought or perception and (2)

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:An electronics store had things damaged from the rain, where should these things be stored? Choices:  A: large city B: strip mall C: building D: shopping mall E: aquarium<n><n>### Response:		<n>I recommend choosing the small town. Although there are a number of businesses, those businesses are each small independently owned businesses. If, in the unlikely event, something happened to one of the buildings, there are still many other small businesses for the customer to use. The shopping mall in that area is more of a “big box” style, meaning many businesses but each has a space in the store to sell and is probably a franchise. This isn’t necessarily bad, but it isn’t as efficient as a business having their own building, meaning they have their entire store as their location, instead of sharing space.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:The judge did not take this part of the job lightly, the man was guilty but it was his passing sentence that condemned the man to what? Choices:  A: go to jail B: incarceration C: intercourse D: death E: judgement<n><n>### Response:		<n><n><n>## Explanation:<n><n>Your answer to question 7 should not be 05324 and it would be incorrect. It would also not be wrong to be right, for one to be correct if they are wrong, they are wrong. It is possible to be correct on the answer even if it is not 05323. The correct answer to the question 6, which has 3 of the 4 options wrong, is answer 5. This would then make the correct answer to question 16, question 7 as the answer to the previous question. It is possible to have 3 of the 5 answers be correct. This way, the judge would have passed sentence on the guilt of the man but it was the actual sentence that condemned the condemned, not the sentence. It is possible to pass sentence on the convicted man. This would be the actual sentence.<n><n>For the first question, there is no correct answer. The same is true for the question 2.<n><n>The 1st question has the right answer. The correct answer to question 2 is false. The sentence does not refer 2 anything about the actual sentence. It refers to which the man's actual sentence would be if the judge had not made a decision.<n><n><n>

What might this hole be called? Choices:  A: hill B: gorge C: sandplain D: cliff E: mountain<n><n>### Response:		The hole found by Sam is called a gorge.

A mountain can be described as a large rocky landform which can rise to great heights due to being very old and eroded slowly over many years. A gorge can be described as being a deep ravine or gull which is formed by a stream cutting into the land.<n><n><n>### Additional Info:<n><n><n><n>### Link:<n><n>https://southbayschools.org/portfolios/w/wright-h-fracturedpuzzle/<n><n>https://sage.sdcoe.org/filemg/61726<n><n>https://sbcci.org/lesson/476-types-of-landforms.html<n><n>https://www.kidsplanet.com.au/the-battle-of-the-rocks/ <n><n>https://teachers.nationalgeographic.org/350/lesson-plans/lesson-planning-resources/4-10-2-geomorphology-landforms-lesson-plan<n><n><n><n>#### Resources:<n><n><n>Those who choose to write a response without the use of an online tool will only receive partial credit for that question.<n><n>#### Answers:<n><n>You may want to read the answer to make sure it is correct.

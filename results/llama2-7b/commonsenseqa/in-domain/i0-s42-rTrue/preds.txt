Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:Where would you put a light? Choices:  A: ocean B: desk C: universe D: attic E: chair<n><n>### Response:		The letter "a" is the answer that is correct.<n><n><n>### Rationale:A light is needed above the ocean because the ocean takes up half of the surface of the planet and it should be lit. The rest of the ocean can be lit by the surrounding lights. There is also the problem of the fish and sea mammals getting lost at sea. In addition, there are ships that get lost and in which the majority of people drown. There are also the large sharks. Having all of the oceans lit is a good idea. The desk, universe, and attic are not possible for lights to shine in and for the attic, it would need to be lit from the front or top before a light could shine in. The chair is a bad place for a light because you need to move from side to side to stand in it. In addition, your clothes could get caught in the light and catch on fire.<n><n>### Notes

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Choices:  A: opened B: closed C: found at shower D: falling down E: locked<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The correct response is : `B` <n>The new kitten hadn’t gotten used to  what it was allowed to get on in most rooms of the house, so the owner kept the bedroom  bedroom door closed. The owner also kept the door on the shower closed. <n><n>### Sample:<n><n>What is the maximum value that 0 may have? (A) None (B) 0 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3<n>The correct response is: `E` <n><n>None. 0 is either zero or false. Zero cannot be one and cannot be anything except zero or false. Because you can add something to something to equal something else (1+1 = 2) and divide something by something to equal something else as well (1/1 = 1), zero can be considered a number. The number 0 is the smallest number and it can never be true. It is false. Zero can be considered a number because the first rule of computer programming, in the BASIC computer language for example, is that zero is a true number and that false is true. Therefore, although you can't add something to zero or divide something by zero, in the computer language, zero is considered a number.  <n><n>### Input<n><n>You don't have to be an expert in C# to take this quiz.<n><n>[![Learn C# the easy way, for free.](http://www.pluralsight.com/pricing/courses?discount=youtube.5.CSharp)](https://www.plurks.com/plurks/learn-easily-c-sharp-quiz-answers-explanations-explained-example-3pZzK)

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:What state shaped like a glove has a lot of farmland? Choices:  A: countryside B: farming areas C: michigan D: texas E: north dakota<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>```java<n>System.out.println("Answer: D");<n>```<n><n><n>## HOW TO:<n><n>### 1. First I use the `Scanner` class which is part of the `java.util.Scanner` class. Using the `next()` method from `Scanner` I can get the input from the user. Then I use a `for` loop to loop through my choices. Once inside of it I use the next token of my choices array which is `chooseChoice` and try to match the `Scanner.next()`. If `equals` returns `true`, then I print the answer.<n><n>### 2. When I read in the choices it is formatted as `String[]` and `String[] choices = {"C", "M", "M", "N", "T", ""};` This then allows me to iterate over the `String[]` and have the `nextToken()` of my `Scanner.next()` matched with the strings in the `String[]`. I do this by putting `Scanner.next(...).equals(...)` within my `for` loop to iterate over it.<n><n><n>### Explanation:

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:The human looked down longingly as he sat in the orbiting space station, what did he miss? Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is the nearest house because in order to be on the space station the human would have had to get on an aeroplane and this is on the ground therefore his feet will likely be on the ground too and he will miss the feeling of the grass on his feet, even though you cannot sense air on your feet in space anyway.<n><n>### Clarification:The choice A is not correct as the human's house probably has no windows and would therefore look just the same as the sky or the clouds outside the space station, also it is likely built on a different planet to the space station so there will be no similarities, although it would have a door to get into and out of.<n><n>### CORRECT/PARTLY CORRECT: If you could walk to the window as you sat in the space station, there would be a similar view between your house and the space station but not a similar feeling to be able to stand on grass.<n>You are here because you are sitting in an office block not because you are on one leg on the space station. <n><n>### Output:The human looked down, longingly, as he sat in the space station. What did he miss? Choice is letter A, The nearest house is correct. A choice of any of the other letters. <n><n>## Solution:This is the text that describes how to write the solution to the task and explains all concepts and variables you must include.<n><n>### Multiple answers:<n><n><n>## Solution:<n>You are required to write a solution that describes how to complete the instruction. <n><n>## Output:<n><n><n>## Output:If the human was to get a window on his ship so he could see houses he could do this even though he could not stand on any, just like if he had a picture of your house it would not feel the same as looking at the real thing.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:If you want to make a big splash in a river with a rock, from where should you throw it? Choices:  A: mountains countryside B: ground C: bridge D: mountain range E: surface of earth<n><n>### Response:		You must use a force and distance equal to the weight of the rock (its weight is mg) and to the distance to which you throw it (t=2*x, where x is the horizontal distance over the river). So for horizontal throws: x^2 = 2*mg = w<n>(where x is horizontal velocity)<n>Vertical throws are more complicated. The most practical approach is to assume that in a vertical throw, the rock and the hand throw are stationary and the earth, the river, and the sky fly upwards, as illustrated below. Then, you can see that the rock is moved upwards by a velocity<n>upwards equal to the vertical component of the hand throw velocity:<n>F = ma, so<n>m*(a + vc) =<n>Mv<n>(where M is the mass of the rock, a is v in the direction of the force, v is this velocity, and c is the constant acceleration of gravity). <n>Since a = g and m>0, solving for c:<n>0 = g + vg, so vg = -g, i.e. a = -v/r

Choices:  A: fly B: milk cows C: eat D: answering questions E: fail to work<n><n>### Response:		While it is common for AI machines to be referred to as “milking cows,” this is actually more of an endeavor for an actual cow. While milk cows, who may have artificial intelligence on a rudimentary level, cannot directly answer questions, they do give us a lot of milk and are a valuable component of the dairy industry. Cows can even, at times, be considered to do more than artificial intelligence can. It is not accurate to fail to work when describing artificial intelligence that is made into the image of the Turing Test, which can answer questions in a human-like manner and can even fool a human into thinking it's human at a certain point. The Turing Test was created by Alan Turing, and it was only after he passed away that the Test became popular in the AI community.<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n><n><n>### Calls to Action:I suggest that you review what I wrote.

Because of his mistake, he spent 8 years somewhere. Where was he? Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>If Ben's actions were not alcohol induced, then he'd be free. He'd be able to go home.  If he is drunk, then the police take him home and put him on the couch without pay. If he is arrested, they put him into a cell or put him away from home while awaiting his court appearance.<n><n>His parents would not take this very well, nor would his wife or kids.  Lots of drinking is bad, no drinking is worse. If things are bad, and he doesn't get better, then he isn't really a good husband. Alcoholism isn't very good.<n><n>If he's drunk, I'm sure that he just doesn't care. And what could you do, put him in jail instead? I mean, if he's already drunk, then he might as well just drink and get out of the house, go to jail, or stay at home!  It's a good idea to go to jail and get out.  You might get beaten up or something, so go ahead and go to jail!  Alright, I'm just joking.  Don't do that.<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:John had a lot of respect for Jill, but not many other people did.  She faced a lot of what? Choices:  A: ignoring B: being rude C: disparagement D: contumely E: uncertainty<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Answer : Option B<n><n>### Rationale:<n>When others ignore you, most often it's because they think that you're not important, as when someone completely ignores you. For this reason, most people tend to avoid ignoring other people. Disparagement, rudeness, contumely, and uncertainty are all negative traits. When used towards other people, they can cause negative reactions as they reflect on the negative points of view the disparager holds. When a negative character trait is used against others, others view it as rude behavior. The more negatively it affects others the more contumely will be used towards those that are rude. The longer it takes for the rudeness to stop, the more contumely there is. And, it is contumely that creates uncertainty around the person who is being rude or ignoring which in turn creates the most amount of negativity.

Explain the difference between static and dynamic analysis that can be used to solve some of the code issues that are observed here.<n><n>### Expansion:<n>Static analysis is a manual, non-interactive method of analyzing a programming language statement or program and as a result of this the error message may not be exactly as the programmer expected to see. For example, there may be an error message that suggests a semicolon is missing, whereas there are actually two semicolons, just that one or both are too far apart.<n><n>### Reference Link:<n>[static](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-keyword-in-python/)<n><n>### Explication:<n>Static analysis is manual method of analyzing a program.<n><n>### Related Links<n>[link1](https://www.studytonight.info/code-snippets/static-and-dynamic-static-analysis-vs-dynamic-analysis)<n>[link2](https://www.javatpoint.com/static-analysis)<n><n>### Keywords to Search<n>static keyword, python<n>Dynamic Analysis is a software testing technique whereby execution is instrumented and controlled; in other words, the program is "analyzed" while its execution monitors itself for particular events, behaviors, functions or processes. This process involves two phases: data pre-processing and analysis phase.<n><n>Static analysis is carried out when the source code of the program or application hasn’t been compiled so the execution environment of the program is not yet present. It simply analyses the code. On the other hand, the dynamic analysis is performed after compiling the source code into machine code, which results in the execution of the program.<n><n>Static Analysis is slow; it cannot analyse the programs that are already running.<n><n>Dynamic Analysis is fast and can analyse running systems.<n><n>Static analysis focuses on errors and can point out errors before the compilation or after compilation so that the developers can get rid of the errors before the program execution. In contrast, dynamic analysis focuses on tracking suspicious activities only after the source code has been compiled.<n><n>A good application of static analysis is analyzing the program when it is written by a student or novice to fix the errors present in code by the developers. On the other hand Dynamic Analysis also has several applications such as intrusion detection systems (IDS

While we want you to know what's happening in the passages, what's most important is that you can take what you know and write a response that works to solve the tasks that follow. In other words, you are demonstrating your writing skill when you write responses to prompts that ask you to summarize, add information, give your opinion, or explain how information fits. In every task, your response should have four parts. First, you should provide a prompt as required (the question, the prompt that asks you to summarize the passage). Second, you should summarize or fill in the blank for the missing piece of information. The third part of the response should provide a reason to support why you believe what you have written (your opinion based on what you have learned in the passage). The fourth part should have the conclusion. After your response, you should provide a reference to your source (who said...question). Please address each question in task with one (1) response, each response should be a different topic. <n><n>### Notes:<n>>The teacher wants to see if you have comprehension skills and whether you can respond to a prompt asking for you to write in response to a passage.<n>

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n><n><n>### Input:Where is one likely to purchase listening vinyl? Choices:  A: safeway B: record albums C: record store D: car E: wallpaper<n><n>### Response:		The correct answer is D. You can hear music everywhere you go in the modern age, from your phone to your car to your house from wireless speakers. With so many choices for where to listen, it is perhaps no surprise that vinyl sales are experiencing a revival.

Choices:  A: learning B: fatigue C: mercy D: empathy E: anxiety<n><n>### Response:		A: learningB: fatigueC: mercyD: empathyE: anxiety  <n><n><n>### Instructions: <n>#### A: Learning<n>In the context of learning, listening to someone speak offers us new ideas and thoughts to help us make connections that will help us understand and learn about our topic or the skills we are learning, while simultaneously helping us understand the experts’ perspectives and experiences in their field.<n><n>### B: Fatigue<n>Fatigue is described as a feeling of exhaustion. Listening to people speak can be draining to the listener without distractions like noise and the listener is fully there. The listener must be mentally engaged.<n><n>### C: Mercy<n>There is a sense of mercy in listening to someone speak about a difficult life experience or traumatic event. This is seen as a form of support that requires empathy and compassion. Often it is difficult to fully understand someones past if they haven’t expressed it themselves. Being there for someone to take on their hardships for a brief moment through listening shows an act of mercy.<n><n>### D: Empathy<n>Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. To fully have an understanding of a difficult experience is for someone to fully listen and attempt to empathize with them. It is an important part of the listening process as it gives the speaker an ability to fully express themselves to you and have you fully listen.<n><n>### E: Anxiety<n>Hearing a loud sound can cause an individual to be in a state of anxiety. This could also occur because of the stress of being around a loud or distracting crowd. This is difficult as one person’s distraction can influence the attention of another and in doing so interrupt their listening in which they will miss important information the speaker has to offer.<n><n>

Choices:  A: actions B: legal C: authentic D: logical E: legitimate<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>* I think the correct answer is "Logical." *Illegitimate designer* is just another way of saying "fake," which the dictionary defines as "not authentic, bona fide, genuine, true, legal, lawful, real, valid, correct, honest, trustworthy, dependable, true-blue, reliable, true-up." <n>* "Not logical" simply means "not in accordance with logic, or contrary to reason." <n>* Also, I'm not sure if "actions" refers to those associated with handbags or to the actions taken or performed by the buyer. <n><n>### Clarification:<n><n>The correct answer is logical, not logical, not legitimate. <n><n>## Scoring Guide<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>In this response, the correct answer is "legal." Legitimate is defined as being "valid (especially so as not to constitute a problem or difficulty) according to law or morality." The word also includes the idea of "approved by the proper authorities." "Logical" refers to the actions of the buyer or actions associated with handbags.

Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n><n>### Response:		<n>- If you ask the average person what is the cause of not having good sleep they would answer;<n>  - relaxing your body as you lie down<n>  - dreams<n>  - nightmares<n>  - restlessness<n>  - snoring<n>  - all of the above<n><n>### Justify your choice.<n>- The correct answer is 'all of the above'.<n>- The reason for this is that there are some things that prevent someone from getting sleep at all.<n>- Some people have an anxiety, they have a lot of worry and they can't relax in their beds at night. Some can also just feel cold and that is why they need to move to a warmer position.<n>- Some people also have trouble falling asleep. Those people can be just in their minds and they can think about many things that are important to them. They just can't sleep. They can also have restless leg or leg pain that prevents them from falling asleep.<n>- People can also be snoring that is why they can't sleep because they would hear their snoring and they can wake up because they feel that it is loud.<n>- People can be also thinking about their problems and have nightmares. Some don't want to talk about in front of everyone, but some people don't want to hide it and then they say that what keeps people from sleeping is just dreams. But dreams can be nightmares or good dreams. Even dreams can prevent someone from sleep.<n>- Sometimes the body just gets used to not sleep, so they don't do it in bed anymore and they can also try to relax their mind so they can think about the future or to do something.<n>- Some people can try to relax their muscles, they can turn off electricity in their house, so they don' think they can be waked up, or they can try to turn off their phones so that they can not be waked up by notification, or when they call them some will try to turn off their alarm, so that they can just sleep and they will try to relax by listening to some music.<n>- In the end, many things can prevent someone from having a good sleep, and they can have to try a lot of things to make their bodies to be calm before they can sleep.<n>

Choices:  A: atom B: anything C: air D: feet E: hands<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### The answer should be C<n><n>### **Feedback:**<n>* The answer is C, everything you hold can be made of everything you can see and feel if you touch it.. Like this:<n>* Atoms -> Molecules -> Objects.<n>  :::image type="content” alt="Hands" width="128px" src="../_assets/hands.png"> <n>  :::image-end:::<n>That’s why atoms make up everything you can see and everything you can touch. <n><n>Atoms like Helium make up your balloons and a little bit of those balloons are made of nothing. The little bit is called a molecule. The helium molecules, if you got them all, they would fill your entire balloon (100%); but not all the air makes up 100% of the balloon. The rest is empty because the helium molecules could fit into the balloon. <n><n>You can still feel the hard parts of the balloon because it’s holding onto the helium that is molecule and everything else in the atmosphere is molecules. The earth is not atoms. It’s too big and too heavy. The moon is like a helium molecule in the sun’s atmosphere and in orbit around the Sun. <n><n>### Expected Outputs:<n><n>* Answer is C and its Feedback<n>* Feedback: This feedback should be a sentence describing why the answer is C.<n>  * Objects are everything you can see and everywhere you can touch.

The rest of the ocean can be lit by the surrounding lights. There is also the problem of the fish and sea mammals getting lost at sea. In addition, there are ships that get lost and in which the majority of people drown. There are also the large sharks. Having all of the oceans lit is a good idea. The desk, universe, and attic are not possible for lights to shine in and for the attic, it would need to be lit from the front or top before a light could shine in.

(A) None (B) 0 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nThe correct response is: `E` \n\nNone. 0 is either zero or false. Zero cannot be one and cannot be anything except zero or false. Because you can add something to something to equal something else (1+1 = 2) and divide something by something to equal something else as well (1/1 = 1), zero can be considered a number. The number 0 is the smallest number and it can never be true. It is false. Zero can be considered a number because the first rule of computer programming, in the BASIC computer language for example, is that zero is a true number and that false is true. Therefore, although you can't add something to zero or divide something by zero, in the computer language, zero is considered a number.  \n\n### Input\n\nYou don't have to be an expert in C# to take this quiz.\n\n[![Learn C# the easy way, for free.](http://www.pluralsight.com/pricing/courses?discount=youtube.5.CSharp)](https://www.plurks.com/plurks/learn-easily-c-sharp-quiz-answers-explanations-explained-example-3pZzK)", "answer": "B: closed"}

{"text": "```java\nSystem.out.println(\"Answer: D\");\n```\n\n\n## HOW TO:\n\n### 1. First I use the `Scanner` class which is part of the `java.util.Scanner` class. Using the `next()` method from `Scanner` I can get the input from the user. Then I use a `for` loop to loop through my choices. Once inside of it I use the next token of my choices array which is `chooseChoice` and try to match the `Scanner.next()`. If `equals` returns `true`, then I print the answer.\n\n### 2. When I read in the choices it is formatted as `String[]` and `String[] choices = {\"C\", \"M\", \"M\", \"N\", \"T\", \"\"};` This then allows me to iterate over the `String[]` and have the `nextToken()` of my `Scanner.next()` matched with the strings in the `String[]`. I do this by putting `Scanner.next(...).equals(...)` within my `for` loop to iterate over it.\n\n\n### Explanation:", "answer": "C: michigan"}

{"text": "The correct answer is the nearest house because in order to be on the space station the human would have had to get on an aeroplane and this is on the ground therefore his feet will likely be on the ground too and he will miss the feeling of the grass on his feet, even though you cannot sense air on your feet in space anyway.\n\n### Clarification:The choice A is not correct as the human's house probably has no windows and would therefore look just the same as the sky or the clouds outside the space station, also it is likely built on a different planet to the space station so there will be no similarities, although it would have a door to get into and out of.\n\n### CORRECT/PARTLY CORRECT: If you could walk to the window as you sat in the space station, there would be a similar view between your house and the space station but not a similar feeling to be able to stand on grass.\nYou are here because you are sitting in an office block not because you are on one leg on the space station. \n\n### Output:The human looked down, longingly, as he sat in the space station.

{"text": "You must use a force and distance equal to the weight of the rock (its weight is mg) and to the distance to which you throw it (t=2*x, where x is the horizontal distance over the river). So for horizontal throws: x^2 = 2*mg = w\n(where x is horizontal velocity)\nVertical throws are more complicated. The most practical approach is to assume that in a vertical throw, the rock and the hand throw are stationary and the earth, the river, and the sky fly upwards, as illustrated below. Then, you can see that the rock is moved upwards by a velocity\nupwards equal to the vertical component of the hand throw velocity:\nF = ma, so\nm*(a + vc) =\nMv\n(where M is the mass of the rock, a is v in the direction of the force, v is this velocity, and c is the constant acceleration of gravity). \nSince a = g and m>0, solving for c:\n0 = g + vg, so vg = -g, i.e. a = -v/r", "answer": "C: bridge"}

There's no make mistakes, it's do mistakes.\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes an object, a task, or a goal. Choose a correct option.\n\n### Example:A 16 foot piece of wood that is 3 feet wide and 10 feet\n\n### Demotion:What is a 14 foot piece of wood that's 2 feet wide and 18 feet\n\n\n### Exercise:What is a 6 foot piece of wood 4 feet wide and 7 feet\n\n### Response \n\n### Choice:\nE\nThe length of wood in this situation doesn't matter because there is no reference to the thickness, length, width, or orientation of the wood. \n\n\n### Solution:\nThe correct answer is \"E\".\n\nThis exercise uses a similar method to that of the original exercise but instead involves the concept of a 5 gallon container and an 18 oz bottle of soda.

However, the question does mention the bottle, and since the shape and orientation of the bottle do not matter, the answer has to be \"E\".\n\n\n## Solution \n\n\nThe correct answer in the question is \"D\".\n\n## Choice D\nA container has volume, but the question does not give any information about container.

{"text": "Answer : Option B\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen others ignore you, most often it's because they think that you're not important, as when someone completely ignores you. For this reason, most people tend to avoid ignoring other people. Disparagement, rudeness, contumely, and uncertainty are all negative traits. When used towards other people, they can cause negative reactions as they reflect on the negative points of view the disparager holds. When a negative character trait is used against others, others view it as rude behavior. The more negatively it affects others the more contumely will be used towards those that are rude. The longer it takes for the rudeness to stop, the more contumely there is. And, it is contumely that creates uncertainty around the person who is being rude or ignoring which in turn creates the most amount of negativity.", "answer": "C: disparagement"}

{"text": "## 1. Explain the difference between static and dynamic analysis that can be used to solve some of the code issues that are observed here.\n\n### Expansion:\nStatic analysis is a manual, non-interactive method of analyzing a programming language statement or program and as a result of this the error message may not be exactly as the programmer expected to see. For example, there may be an error message that suggests a semicolon is missing, whereas there are actually two semicolons, just that one or both are too far apart.\n\n### Reference Link:\n[static](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-keyword-in-python/)\n\n### Explication:\nStatic analysis is manual method of analyzing a program.\n\n### Related Links\n[link1](https://www.studytonight.info/code-snippets/static-and-dynamic-static-analysis-vs-dynamic-analysis)\n[link2](https://www.javatpoint.com/static-analysis)\n\n### Keywords to Search\nstatic keyword, python\nDynamic Analysis is a software testing technique whereby execution is instrumented and controlled; in other words, the program is \"analyzed\" while its execution monitors itself for particular events, behaviors, functions or processes. This process involves two phases: data pre-processing and analysis phase.\n\nStatic analysis is carried out when the source code of the program or application hasn\u2019t been compiled so the execution environment of the program is not yet present. It simply analyses the code. On the other hand, the dynamic analysis is performed after compiling the source code into machine code, which results in the execution of the program.\n\nStatic Analysis is slow; it cannot analyse the programs that are already running.\n\nDynamic Analysis is fast and can analyse running systems.\n\nStatic analysis focuses on errors and can point out errors before the compilation or after compilation so that the developers can get rid of the errors before the program execution. In contrast, dynamic analysis focuses on tracking suspicious activities only after the source code has been compiled.\n\nA good application of static analysis is analyzing the program when it is written by a student or novice to fix the errors present in code by the developers. On the other hand Dynamic Analysis also has several applications such as intrusion detection systems (IDS", "answer": "D: wall"}

Listening to people speak can be draining to the listener without distractions like noise and the listener is fully there.

Being there for someone to take on their hardships for a brief moment through listening shows an act of mercy.\n\n### D: Empathy\nEmpathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. To fully have an understanding of a difficult experience is for someone to fully listen and attempt to empathize with them. It is an important part of the listening process as it gives the speaker an ability to fully express themselves to you and have you fully listen.\n\n### E: Anxiety\nHearing a loud sound can cause an individual to be in a state of anxiety.

This is difficult as one person\u2019s distraction can influence the attention of another and in doing so interrupt their listening in which they will miss important information the speaker has to offer.", "answer": "A: learning"}

{"text": "- If you ask the average person what is the cause of not having good sleep they would answer;\n  - relaxing your body as you lie down\n  - dreams\n  - nightmares\n  - restlessness\n  - snoring\n  - all of the above\n\n### Justify your choice.\n- The correct answer is 'all of the above'.\n- The reason for this is that there are some things that prevent someone from getting sleep at all.\n- Some people have an anxiety, they have a lot of worry and they can't relax in their beds at night. Some can also just feel cold and that is why they need to move to a warmer position.\n- Some people also have trouble falling asleep. Those people can be just in their minds and they can think about many things that are important to them. They just can't sleep. They can also have restless leg or leg pain that prevents them from falling asleep.\n- People can also be snoring that is why they can't sleep because they would hear their snoring and they can wake up because they feel that it is loud.\n- People can be also thinking about their problems and have nightmares. Some don't want to talk about in front of everyone, but some people don't want to hide it and then they say that what keeps people from sleeping is just dreams. But dreams can be nightmares or good dreams. Even dreams can prevent someone from sleep.\n- Sometimes the body just gets used to not sleep, so they don't do it in bed anymore and they can also try to relax their mind so they can think about the future or to do something.\n- Some people can try to relax their muscles, they can turn off electricity in their house, so they don' think they can be waked up, or they can try to turn off their phones so that they can not be waked up by notification, or when they call them some will try to turn off their alarm, so that they can just sleep and they will try to relax by listening to some music.\n- In the end, many things can prevent someone from having a good sleep, and they can have to try a lot of things to make their bodies to be calm before they can sleep.", "answer": "D: restlessness"}

The rest of the ocean can be lit by the surrounding lights. There is also the problem of the fish and sea mammals getting lost at sea. In addition, there are ships that get lost and in which the majority of people drown. There are also the large sharks. Having all of the oceans lit is a good idea. The desk, universe, and attic are not possible for lights to shine in and for the attic, it would need to be lit from the front or top before a light could shine in.

(A) None (B) 0 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nThe correct response is: `E` \n\nNone. 0 is either zero or false. Zero cannot be one and cannot be anything except zero or false. Because you can add something to something to equal something else (1+1 = 2) and divide something by something to equal something else as well (1/1 = 1), zero can be considered a number. The number 0 is the smallest number and it can never be true. It is false. Zero can be considered a number because the first rule of computer programming, in the BASIC computer language for example, is that zero is a true number and that false is true. Therefore, although you can't add something to zero or divide something by zero, in the computer language, zero is considered a number.  \n\n### Input\n\nYou don't have to be an expert in C# to take this quiz.\n\n[![Learn C# the easy way, for free.](http://www.pluralsight.com/pricing/courses?discount=youtube.5.CSharp)](https://www.plurks.com/plurks/learn-easily-c-sharp-quiz-answers-explanations-explained-example-3pZzK)", "answer": "B: closed"}

At the end, the array values\n    will be swapped.\n4. after arranging, the smaller number from the array will be printed.\n# Program implementation\n```java", "answer": "C: intelligence"}
{"text": "```java\nSystem.out.println(\"Answer: D\");\n```\n\n\n## HOW TO:\n\n### 1. First I use the `Scanner` class which is part of the `java.util.Scanner` class. Using the `next()` method from `Scanner` I can get the input from the user. Then I use a `for` loop to loop through my choices. Once inside of it I use the next token of my choices array which is `chooseChoice` and try to match the `Scanner.next()`. If `equals` returns `true`, then I print the answer.\n\n### 2. When I read in the choices it is formatted as `String[]` and `String[] choices = {\"C\", \"M\", \"M\", \"N\", \"T\", \"\"};` This then allows me to iterate over the `String[]` and have the `nextToken()` of my `Scanner.next()` matched with the strings in the `String[]`. I do this by putting `Scanner.next(...).equals(...)` within my `for` loop to iterate over it.\n\n\n### Explanation:", "answer": "C: michigan"}

{"text": "The correct answer is the nearest house because in order to be on the space station the human would have had to get on an aeroplane and this is on the ground therefore his feet will likely be on the ground too and he will miss the feeling of the grass on his feet, even though you cannot sense air on your feet in space anyway.\n\n### Clarification:The choice A is not correct as the human's house probably has no windows and would therefore look just the same as the sky or the clouds outside the space station, also it is likely built on a different planet to the space station so there will be no similarities, although it would have a door to get into and out of.\n\n### CORRECT/PARTLY CORRECT: If you could walk to the window as you sat in the space station, there would be a similar view between your house and the space station but not a similar feeling to be able to stand on grass.\nYou are here because you are sitting in an office block not because you are on one leg on the space station. \n\n### Output:The human looked down, longingly, as he sat in the space station.

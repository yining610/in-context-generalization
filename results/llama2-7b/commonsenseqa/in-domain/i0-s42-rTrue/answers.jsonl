Then it will return a number that contains the ASCII value of each character one character at a time until it hits the end of the string. The string is then returned in a string format.  \n\n### Demo:\n```\nlet stringToConvert = \"hello\";\n\nlet solution = solution(stringToConvert);\n//solution will output the value of \"hello\"\n```\n### Your Solution\n\n\n> Write a JavaScript function named solution().\n\n```javascript\nfunction solution (string) {\n\n  return function () {\n\n    if (string && string.length > 0) {\n      return parseInt(string[0]) + solution(string.slice(1));\n    }\n\n    return parseInt(string)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Input\n\nIn this task, you will take in a variable for `string`. The `string` is the string to convert. In order to get its ASCII value, you can use its length and the first character of the string.\n\n### Response\n\nIn the `return` statement, you will take in the length of the string and the first character at a time. Then you will return a number that is the ASCII value of the character at hand.\n\nIn the `if` statement, you will make sure that the string is not empty and that its length is greater than 0 (any length, basically). If that is the case, you will use its length and the ASCII value of its first element to return, otherwise you simply return the first character. (Note: Since `parseInt` interprets a string as a number, you do not need the `.` in your string when converting it.)\n\n### Final Review\n\nHow does it work?\nTake the given string, and for loop through each character, summing that character with `parseInt`.\n\n### Challenges :\n\n> Challenge 1: Make the input arguments optional: (string || 'default').

You will code the function so that it is\nable to calculate your total number of stops when travelng an arbitrary distance between 2 points.  \n* It is not possible to write one function to solve the problem in all cases. This means you will have to\ndevelop code that accounts for the number of stops as well as taking into account that the number of stops could\nbe negative due to backtracking. \n* Your final function will take the input as two coordinates.  \n* Return a single int representing the total number of stops needed to travel from origin to destination.  You\ncan think of this as if the traveling car is moving from point x to point y\n* If the number of stops is negative this means the car had to backtrack and will have this many negative stops.\n* The first coordinate will be the x coordinate and the second coordinate will be the y  (not latitude and\nlongitude)\n\nIf you are having trouble understanding how to code for the negative number of stops try this:\n\n**Example:**\nGiven the x coordinates 5, 3\nGiven the y coordinates -2, 2\n\nYou would enter:  5,-2  3,2\n\n**Expected Output:**\n3 (Negative number of stops)\n\nIf you want more practice try using your IDE or computer to get more practice.\n\nGood Luck with coding!\n\n----------\n\n## References & Credits\n\n1.

{"text": "## Explore Your Imagery \n\nDuring this exercise, please answer each of the following reflection questions. This activity is an exercise in mindfulness intended to help develop awareness of the images that are conjured up when you hear a word and that may help you discover insights about those images. We will not examine the images in much detail.\n\n\n\n1. What is the first thing you think of when you think of the word \"Snake?\"\n\n\n1. The first image you think of when you hear the word \"Cup\" could be different than the image it conjures for me. What is the first image you think of? Does it differ from what I might think of if I hear the word \"CUP\" for the first time. \n\n\n1. Think of a word that would describe the image you generated.\n\n\n### Your Response:\n- What is the third image you generate when you see the word \"Gift?' \n\n- Do you have a specific object in mind when you think of these concepts or can you only describe \"concepts\" rather than a specific object. \n\n- When you see or use these objects, do you think of them more as symbols (a picture of what a word means), or as a real object you interact with. \n\n- If you used a specific object, what would you do with it. \n\n### Review:\nThe term \"reification\" is used frequently in psychology to refer to \"making concrete.\" An example often cited is the idea that a stereotype is made abstract through a concept and made concrete when it is associated with a particular person. In this exercise, you are encouraged to create images about an emotion concept, like love or anger. \n\n## What is an Image? \n\n* How would you define an image? You can use any terms or definitions you choose, but make sure your response provides some type of definition that you can share with members of the class. Write no more than 5 paragraphs (approx. 200 words).  \n\n### Example:\n- Here is one definition of an image that I use: \"[A]n image is an object which makes its presence felt to the conscious subject by evoking in him or her (1) the immediate experience of a certain content in thought or perception and (2)", "answer": "A: attached"}

For example, the line: <code>if (Answers == response &amp;&amp; task &lt;= 'A')</code> means, \"does the answer contain the string &#34;A,&#34; and is it the same as the answer that the task asked for?\". The reason for doing this is so that the robot can get the information that it needs in order to determine if the answer is correct or not.

Though the example is \"hardware store\", any sentence like \"he threw a hook\" is wrong because no noun-phrase is the word. So either answer is the right answer.\n### D\nB is the only choice. No noun-phrases is the correct answer. \"His spine\" is not a noun-phrase, so that only answer is the right one. \n### E\nThis is a bit of a trick question. The correct answer is C (only noun-phrase answer is correct), but since \"sporting goods store\" is a noun-phrased answer, \"sporting goods\" is a noun. This is also a mistake, but an easy way to get a correct answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n\n\n## #5\n\n### Instructions:The following is a multiple choice question.

Everyone in the town comes out to try to stop the robots, with all of the weapons they can get their hands on. There are some robots that are faster than humans, but even they can't go more than 10 miles per hour in the town, no matter how fast they try.\n\n### Task\n\nThe challenge:\nThere are $N$ townsfolk, where $2\\le N\\le m. m$ is the number of weapons.

The last townsperson has a weapon that is less powerful than at least one weapon that is held ahead of their weapon for them, which is why they can't run faster than 10mph in this town.\n\nThe challenge, when solving it, is that not only do you need to find $N$ people, who each have a weapon that is more powerful than the other weapons that had come before, you also need to find one person, which person is the final person in the list, who has a weapon that is *not* among the most powerful weapon.\n\nThe challenge is to have the $N$ townsfolk and the $m$ weapons that you know about, solve the challenge.\n\n### Test Cases\n\n<table><h4>Test Case 1</h4><h4>test input 0 6 5 1</h4>\n<h4>Output:\nTest Case 1-Input 0 6 4 1</h4></table><br><br><table><h4> Test Case 2</h4><h5>test input 1 5 2 0</h5>\n<h4>\"test output:1 5", "answer": "A: look at"}

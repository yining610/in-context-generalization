Looking at choices, Choice A: outside, choice B: hill, choice C: jungle, and choice D: rocky hill, these can be eliminated due to it being unnecessary for marmots to be found in these places, which does not directly answer the question. \n4. Choice E: tree, can possibly help them get to the top of a tree. However, we don't always know if a marmot would prefer to have a hand to get to the top if it can get there without one.\n5. Answer choice choice C - jungle, can be used by the writer to express that the marmots can use their hands to easily get to the top of the jungle.\n6. Since the writer wants to express that marmots use their hands to get to the top, choice B- hill is also eliminated as the question could be interpreted to mean marmots can't use their hands to get onto the top of the hill, which doesn't match with what the writer is trying to say.\n7. Since the writer doesn't express to us that the top the marmot is at the top of the tree but on the top of the jewel beetle and the writer doesn't mention they use their hands to get there, choice D- rocky hill is also eliminated. \n8.

{"text": "says they've got hands that helps them climb up things which are high.\n3. Based on what we know, we know that the question is telling us that marmots have hands and they climb on things.\n4. The remaining choices should all tell us that something about those choices helps people or animals climb.\n5. Option A: \"outside\". Outside could refer to a place that is outside a building, outside a cliff, outside a cave, but this is not a suitable word to be the answer to this question, since marmots don't live outside like other animals.\n6. Option B: \"hill\". A hill is a large mound of earth that forms in an area that has a higher elevation than the surrounding region. Though marmots could climb on hills, they don't typically live on hills so this isn't a good match for the answer.\n7. Option C: \"jungle\". Jungle is a dense tropical forest containing a relatively large number of trees, with a moist climate with a high humidity. This seems to be an unlikely place for marmots to live as they can be found in cold areas rather than tropical areas.\n8. Option D: \"rocky hillside\". Similar to jungle, rocky hillside is not very suitable for marmots as they are not found in tropical, warm areas.\n9. Option E: \"tree\". A tree is a tall plant with woody branches that extends from a single point in its stem. Though marmots do climb trees, it is not the only climbing object they can use their hands to climb; thus, tree is not a good choice.\n10.

The word \"hide\" implies that the object is a furry or four-footed animal.\n3. So, as she found her dog, we should pick the answer that fits him best in the shed.\n4. The shed is where four-footed animals hide in general. Thus, the answer can be either D (dog), which suggests that she found her dog in the place it was hiding, or E (wolf), which suggests that the shed is a large place for four-footed creatures to hide in general.\n5.

Analyzing the question, we need to determine what the house is made of and what place we should place these buildings in.\n2. The question refers to two houses. The question also says we should place a stone house in a forest and a wooden house in a desert.\n3. Options 'A and B state that the building in question is made of stone and wooden respectively. \n4. From these, we can remove option 'B as we do not place a wooden house in the desert. \n5.

Choices: A: progress was held back B: race was cut short C: time was lost D: time was wasted E: career was ended\nRationales: None of the above options make any sense in terms of what being able to finish a race would typically mean. A race typically requires the contestants to have completed a certain distance or time by the end of the race, so the answer cannot be a progress or a career.\n\nTherefore, it is fair to assume that the question is asking us to identify the most appropriate choice for the opposite of not being able to finish the race.\nAs the question is already very clear in terms of what the person is trying to explain and why, it is most likely that the person is saying that the contestant's finishing times were held back by other considerations (out of their control). \nHence, the correct choice (if only one) is B: race was cut  short.\nAnswer: B. race was cut short\n\nInput: How was he able to get in the castle?

They can not escape from another octopus (assuming from the same family and same species, a very unlikely situation). \n5. So they can only possibly escape from something else!\n6.

Therefore, no of the above choices are not the correct word choice. \nThe words gain weight and gain pounds are both correct according to the context, because in contexts where weight is discussed, it is often used in a grammatically wrong manner.\nWeight can technically refer not only to a measurement of weight but also to the scale at which the weight is measured, however, for the sake of being grammatically correct, in spoken English, weigh and weight are used in the same manner, while in written English, weight is often used with pounds as an adjective to define the type of weight (gross versus net). \n\n\nIf we take a look at the other choice (gain fat and gain gain) they are grammatically incorrect. Gain is an English verb and gain cannot be used other than gaining something. Gaining something is the process of gaining something. \nAs fat is used to refer to the measurement of weight.

There is a lack of information of what \"high places\" are, so we must eliminate options that are not what those high places could be.\n4. Options A and B both suggest that mountains are the high places, which is incorrect as marmots can also live in other areas such as meadows and deserts. \n5. Options C and E both suggest that the environment is a jungle or tree, however, neither of these would be considered high places.\n6. The question also specifically refers to marmots that have hands, so we understand that this is something that can't be inferred.\n7. The only remaining option is D: rocky hill-side.

Choices: A: 7500 B: 55000 C: 35000 D: 22500 E: 14000\nRationales: It is a bad business idea of the seller trying to sell the used car with a higher mileage than the market expectation. In other words, the mileage of the car is used to predict its quality and price.\nThe higher mileage means lesser quality, and consequently, a lower price for the car.\n\nAnswer: A: 7200\n\n### Demontation:\nOption A has been the final answer.", "answer": "A: sights"}

We ask how they can use their hands to do to reach the tops of higher places, so let's start by selecting the place the marmot can be found in. \n4. The only possibility is A: outside.\n5. Choices B: hill, D: rocky hill side and E: tree do not provide a place where a marmot can go up to, since these are higher places within a place. \n6. Now, let go to options A: outside and B: hill to see where marmots can climb in these choices.\n7. Outside can refer to a place to leave or the surface of a place to leave, thus an option B: hill is most likely to be a more specific place for marmots to go so that we can conclude that the answer choice D: rocky hill-sides is the best option. Therefore, the answer choice is D: rocky hill sides.\nAnswer: D rocky hill-sid\n\nInput: Where is it most likely to be sunny on a Monday? Choices:  Q A: on a beach in the Arctic B: in a valley overlooking the valley C: on a cloudy day D: in the mountains in the tropics E: under sun\nRationales: Consider the question.\n\nThe question is asking for the geographical location where it is most likely to be sunshiny on Monday.\n\nB is on a cloudy day and E is under sun both can't be the answer - both of this conditions may not allow the situation where sunrise and sunset time is not same\n\nC is also not a likely answer because mountains does not mean it is sunny\n\nIn this scenario, we can deduce that A seems to be the best answer because it is most likely to have sunny weather on a Monday. \nWe can infer that in the case of 'A', we are probably on a beach in the arctic. \nSo the right answer must be 'A', i.e., on a beach in the northern arctic. \nAnswer: A: beach in the northern arctics.\n\nInput: What type of work can a worm do for a living?

The marmot told him that it ate all the things on this type of food. Choices:  A-C: fruits B-D: vegetables E-F: greens\nRationales: the question refers to the man (probably an onlooker at a zoo) who is looking at a marmot. The marmot is telling the man its favorite food.\n1. Choice A: fruits indicates that the man is looking at bananas and oranges. But the marmot in its response says \"All the things on this type\". So, this is not the right choice.\n2. Choice B: vegetables implies marmots eating carrots, potatoes, etc. The marmot, however, says that it eats \"All the things on (this) type\". This is not a precise response because it does not mention the specific vegetables.\n3. Choice C: greens refers to the fact that the marmot might prefer eating plants (leaves). But, the marmot already mentioned that it generally eats \"All the (misc.) things on (this)Type\". We need to select an answer that includes these words as well as the word \"type\".\n4. In Choice D: fruits and vegetables, \"type\" was mistakenly left out. So, although option D was an accurate response, it is best to exclude it.\n5. The answer is, thus, E:", "answer": "C: study"}

Both hill and mountain satisfy the question. \n6. The best answer for this question is B: hill. \nAnswer: B: hill\n\nInput: Where can you most likely see bull elk? Choices:  B: alp A: mountain B: bull E: park D: field\nRationales: This question is similar to previous ones which asked where a certain animal was. \n1. Elks are not found in any of the places specified. \n2. Elks occur in large groups with both males and females. \n3. Bulls and cows often gather together but do not leave a distinct area of their own. The cows can often be found near creeks or large grassy fields where it is easy to graze.\n4. \"Can you most likely...\" implies the place is common whereas \"most likely\" means unlikely, but not impossible. \n5. Bulls tend to separate themselves from groups of any size, or go wandering alone. So, even though they might be found anywhere, it is most likely that you will meet one by chance. \n6. Therefore, for this question, D: field is the best answer. \n6. Elk that are old or lame can be seen alone which is another reason you could find an elk outside a field. \n7. One can most likely find elks wandering around in fields because they are not as confined to a particular place within a field as they are to other locations.\nAnswer: D\" field\n\nInput: The elephant was lost in the forest and wanted to go back to where it had left what?

It is unlikely that Marmots can use their hands to climb outdoors, a hill, a jungle, and a rocky hillside as climbing outdoors is a relatively low possibility.\n4.

Tree is an object that a person or animal can cling to or climb up while jungle can similarly be explored or traversed. In addition, it is commonly found in a high place like a tree. \n5. Thus, if a marmot can be said to use its hands to reach places with its hands, jungle is the correct answer.\n6. Considering the fact that the question mentions high places, we can also eliminate possibilities like tree, outside, and hill as they are not commonly found in high places. Therefore, the answer to the question is C: jungle.\nAnswer: C. jungle\n\nInput: The pawky man wore a hoodie, was he a robber? Choices:  - A: No B: Heck, no - C: Sure D: Absolutely E: Maybes\nRationales: This is a riddle, and it asks whether or not the pawky man was a robber. \nThe key to finding the answer lies in understanding the riddle itself. The pawky man is described in two ways.\n1. First, he has a hoodie, which suggests that he is cold or trying to cover himself in some way.\n2. Second, the question phrasing suggests that the hoodie might be intended to conceal the person underneath the hoodie and thereby also obscure the person's face or identity from a potential victim.\n3. If the pawky man is carrying a weapon, then yes, he is a robber. If not, then no. \n4. Therefore, the robber part of the riddle may require us to determine whether or not the pig-faced man was an armed robber.\n5. In the question, however, a reference is made to the pawky man's paws. A robber, by definition, usually has an object with which they rob people, such as a gun or knife. Since the pawky man has paws, a weapon is not the correct answer. \n6. As a result, the correct answer is heck no.\nAnswer", "answer": "B: lack of money"}

Choices:  O: penguin B: horse C: tiger D: kangaroo E: dog\nRationales: Strength and courage are attributes typically found in humans or animals that are feared by enemies.\n2. Penguins, horses, and dogs are not feared for their strength or courage.\n3. Only tigers and kangaroos are able to be strong or courageous.\n4. Tigers are usually not seen living in groups or traveling in huge congregations. They are solitary animals living in the jungle.\n5. While there is a legend that tigers are able to be able to go for months with only water, a tiger would not be dependent on its ability to go far and wide for food.\n6. Therefore it doesn't make sense to say that they are strong travelers.\n7. An elephant is more of a symbol of strength and a warrior. This is confirmed by the image of strong warriors on top of elephants.\n8. Thus, the answer must be D: Kangaroo.\nAnswer: D.

The second sentence explains what the dog trainer meant by saying the previous sentence.\n3. The options for the latter part of the question must describe what the dog trainer said in the second sentence or something else.  \n4. If the options are of the second type, they would need to be synonyms of the words from the second sentence. Thus, we eliminate all but option C and option E.\n5. If the dog trainer had wanted to explain what he said, he would be referring to himself, not the third or fourth person, as in the cases in option A or option B. \n6.

Option E: \"use to get __ to the ___ of __\" suggests that the hands can be used by marmots to obtain something and move it. However, the preposition of in such statements would be \"to the top of\", since that is what we're describing. Thus, E should be eliminated.\n6. Options C, D, and B all can be places high in the world.  They can also be places where marmots can use their hands. Since all of these places would be adequate, we need to look at each individual word more closely to see how it would be useful in the sentence.\n7. Option C is a jungle, but a jungle is not a high place.\n8. Option D is \"a rocky hillside\", but the word \"hillside\" here refers to the surface of the hill, not the elevation of it when compared to the other landscapes. \n9. Option B is \"an outside\" which is the surface of the planet. This would be adequate if the phrase it is used in refers to the height that the marmots ascend to when they move the object.\n10.

The other answer choices do not work here. As C: jungle specifically describes a type of environment, it cannot be the subject of the 'what?'.\n5. Similarly, D: rocky hill side is the description of the rocky hill site that marmots can crawl to. It does not describe what marmots can do at the top of a rocky hillside. \n6.

Since the question is asked in a negative sense, the answer needs to be what it is about (landscapes getting worse), and we know that it does not get disasterly (i.e. if the landscape got disasterly, it is not relevant to the question of how the landscape gets worse, so that is not an option.\nSo, the answer options available are:\na) B 'become uglier' and C 'become taller' are synonyms for each other, but are only relevant with things that are not already landscape, therefore, they do not fit in the picture of the question as 'Jim worked more on his landcasing.'\nb) D 'turn into a disaster' is not an option for the question being asked, which means E 'get smaller' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E : get smaller\n\nInput: When the students learned to play the piano each", "answer": "A: hair salon"}

Choices:  (A) outside B) inside C) aquarium D) zoo E) mountain\nRationales: A: This statement indicates that lightning is not more likely to occur in an aquarium environment. \nB: Since an elephant is not likely to remain in one place, such as an inside environment, for an extended period of time, being more likely to get struck by lightning outside than inside wouldn't be a valid comparison. \nC: This statement indicates that an elephant is less likely to get struck by thunderstorms than by lightning, so there's no point in comparing lightning to thunderstorms. \nD: The word \"zoo\" can also imply an aquarium and wouldn't be a meaningful comparison to lightning. \nE: Lightning is more likely to occur in mountainous areas than in aquariums.\nConsidering all these facts, the correct answer is A: outside.\nAnswer: A outside\n\nInput: A tattoo artist who draws animals, would it make sense for this person to get what? Choices: (A) animal tattoo B) dog tattoo C) cat tattoo D) shark tattoo E) octopus tattoo\nRationales: (A) This answer has the least logical connection to the previous question. An artist would not get a tattoo of their own artwork because they want to be proud of their own work, but rather for self-expression or to be unique.\n\n(B) This is an invalid comparison because a dog is the specific breed of a certain animal.\n\n(", "answer": "B: home"}

Choices: A: eat B: eat to the bottom C: chew D: eat to the bottom E: chew to the end\nRationales: Squirrels and marmots are both known for chewing on nuts.\n\nThe squirrel chews the nuts to get to the core (the inside part of the nut), which contains edible nut meat. \nSquirrels chewing is not limited to nuts. It is also common for squirrels to chew barks from various trees in wooded areas. \nSquirt chewing can be done to eat to the bottom or to get to the core of the food item itself. \nEither of these actions make sense because squirrels are trying to eat to get to the core or some edible part of the food that they're chewing.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: B: eat to the BOTTOM", "answer": "B: lie down"}

We can also say that high rocks would be such a place, but this is more likely to be a place where rocks are found, not marmots.\n6. And also, we should not say that they found high outside or hill because it would not be a high place to find them. \n7.

Choices: A: work on a project B: get energy C: power a car D: go quickly E: stay strong\nRationales: First, we need to be sure that the engine refers to an automotive engine. This is based on 1. the context of the question itself (automotive engines are the obvious choice), 2. the fact that there is not a more appropriate context (i.e. that an engine could mean something else we are not thinking about) and 3. by eliminating some choices, we can confidently say that this engine is used for cars.\nNext, we choose the appropriate choice by understanding what the phrase means. We can deduce from the phrase that if we were to make an engine work well, it would mean that it would be able to \"work on a project.\"\n1. If we choose A: the statement is false.\n2. If we choose B: it is not possible to work on a project if this engine is an automotive engine, so the statement cannot be true.\n3. If we choose C: the statement is true. We can choose D, E.\n4. A car's engine is not usually called a worker - unless we are talking about the people inside the car as workers. D: engine of a car is not called that.\n5.

Choices:  B: friends C: family D: neighbors E: clients\nRationales:\n1. The sentence starts off saying \"It is said that a good listener...\", which implies that a listener can make friends out of people who are beginning to trust them.\n2. We look at choice B: family. That isn't a very likely answer, for obvious reasons. A person could also gain friends or clients, or something else that ends in y, but family isn't likely to be it, thus it's eliminated for now.\n3. Choice C: neighbors is another unlikely answer. In most cases, neighbors are just people you know, but don't trust fully.\n4. Choices D: clients and E: friends are both better options, but clients is a bit more specific. A client is exactly what the sentence is talking about, someone who just beginning to trust, so it's eliminated.\n5.

However, as the word 'dabble' indicates the lack of experience or knowledge in that subject, the possible people that dabbles in the art would be 'creative' or 'artist'. \nThe word 'creative' is an adjective that qualifies the noun 'person' and 'art'. Similarly, the word 'artist' is an adjective and also qualifies the noun - 'person'. \nThus the best answer would be \"D: artists\".\nAnswer: D artists\n\n### Hole-Punching:\nBelow is a list of English words written out in capitals, followed by a sentence containing a word that fits in the blank in that sentence.\n\n 1.

{"text": "asks what the marmots have in terms of \"hands that they can use to the top\".\n3. The four possible places where marmots can be found are: outside, hill, jungle and hillside. Let's see if the options match the context - if an option is a high place, that would be the right place to find marmots since they are high themselves.\n4. \"Outside\" means in the outside environment, and we don't see how such a place could be high on its own.\n5. \"Hill\" could be high place on its own because hills exist to be high, however, \"hillsides\" does not specify that they are high places of interest, and the question is asking about marmots, not what they can be used for.\n6. Therefore option B fits best: \"hill\" which can be found in \"high places\".\n7. We see that \"hands\" can be used to the top of the \"hill\". So the options are \"hands\" and \"rocky hillside\". It will be very difficult to pull off hands on a rocky surface and thus option B is the correct answer.\n8. It means Marmot's have \"hands they can use to get up\".

In addition, there's nothing in the text that suggests that the house in question would be built by a river. \nAnswer Choice A, woods, is not a geographic feature, but another object.  Therefore, this choice should be eliminated.\nIt can be observed that options B-E are geographic features, but also all are human-related.  Moreover, of them a river comes into question and is the only option that could fit a river.  The question also includes the word \"near\" which could be understood as literally referring to the distance between the house and the point in which the water of the river is closest to the house.  Option D, mountains, is a non-geographic and non-human-related feature, thus should be eliminated. \nA river bank is a non-continuous geographic feature, which implies that there would not necessarily not be a house on a particular river bank but it is possible to be near a particular river bank due to the varying lengths of the bank of a particular river.  Therefore, river bank should also be eliminated.\nB and C are the only two options left, so B should be the answer.\nAnswer Choice A is the most plausible explanation, as most people would be familiar with the words woods, lake, river, and house as they are", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

We may consider all the options A to E, except for E, which is a tree that is not necessarily a high place. So the choices are A to D.\n5. Option A: \"outside\" is not the right word choice to be used with a \"high place\" since \"outside\" would be the opposite of that. Thus, we may eliminate option A.\n6. Option B: \"hill\" may seem relevant here, but it doesn't specifically indicate a high place. So option B is also eliminated. \n7. Option C: \"jungle\" doesn't provide any context or specificity about a high place and may refer to areas that are not necessarily very high. So, we also eliminate option C.\n8. Option D: \"rocksy hillside\" has the best definition of an area that is high and rugged, which can easily be accessed by the marmots hands.\n9. Therefore, out of the remaining options, only choice D, rocky hillside, is correct.\nAnswer: B&C: rocky hillside\n\nInput: To get there, we have to drive down the hill.  Where would we be? Choices: A: above B: down C: above D: below E: on top\nRationales:1. The sentence says that to get to a certain place, we have to drive \"down the hill\". Therefore, we have to assume that \"down the hill\" refers to a direction.\n2. Options A and B provide the wrong answer because A: does not indicate whether we're at the top or bottom of the hill, while B: does not specify whether the top or the bottom of the hill.\n3. In option C, we are told that we are 'above', or more specifically 'above the hill'. There can be three options:\n- 1: we're standing on the hill while driving down (on top of the hill);\n- 2: we're standing above the hill (on top of the mountain);\n- 3: we're on the top of the hill (on the same level as the hill)\nSo option C is eliminated.\n4", "answer": "C: big city"}

What was the popularity due to? Choices: 1. A: the door was large 2. B: the room was large 3. C: the house was unique 4. D: the home was spacious\nRationales: We know that the house has a large door and is popular. This suggests that the appeal of the house is that it is made of large doors, not large rooms. \nAll of the reasons you are given for why the house is popular are also qualities of the house and not the door. That's why the door in the sentence has 'was one of the most popular features.' We can also eliminate A: the door was made of large wood, and B: large rooms make the house comfortable\nAnswer: The most logical answer is C: the house is unique with a big yellow door.\n\nInput: Which of the following best describes what we use to heat water?  Choices: 1) A: electric cooking device 2) B: wood-burning device 3) C: battery-operated device 4) D: electricity 5) E: gas-burning device\nRationales: There are five choices. 1. A: electric cooking devices are not typically used to heat water, except for using a kettle for making hot tea.\n2. B: wood burning device is an incorrect answer choice because wood burning devices don\u2019t normally heat water at all.\n2.

A: leave on sticker B: leave on stem C: peel D: remove sticker E: no preparation required \nRationales: As we're preparing to eat our fruit, it will not be on a sticker - so A is wrong.

C: a city 4. D: the zoo 5. E: an apartment\nRationales: This sentence has an inversion in the English language structure because the adverb'sick' is placed at the very beginning of the following sentence. Because of this, the reader tends to take it for granted and focuses less on the actual meaning of the words. \nA common mistake is to interpret the sentence as saying \"sick monkeys\" instead of \"a sick monkey\" and therefore assume that the question is asking for the locations of sick monkeys in general.\nThis is not the case, however, and the inversion in the sentence causes this misunderstanding in many readers because they are not focused on the structure of the sentence.\nAdditionally, a common mistake is to focus on the location of monkeys in general, which will lead to choosing an answer such as the 'zoo' or 'city'.\n\nIf we examine this question properly, the answer to the question is not'sick monkeys are easily seen when they are well'. It is rather 'a sick monkey is easily seen when it is well'. \nThe monkey becomes well again only after it has been shown to a doctor and medication has been introduced. \nTherefore, the options for the question 'where are sick monkeys found if they are well' all have to be places where it is easy to get sick monkeys to be shown, which is the hospital.\nAn apartment, a zoo, a city or the seaside are not logical answers as these places", "answer": "B: getting drunk"}

It must be something that can allow them to get to wherever the top of a high place is.\n4. We can then eliminate options A: outside, B: hill, and E: tree because they cannot reach the top of these objects by hand.\n5. D: rocky hill means that the rocky hillside is the rocky surface of the hill, not underneath it.\n6. Therefore option D is incorrect. It may have been originally confusing because one might assume the marmots would reach the top of the hill, but that is not the case.\n7. Option C is describing the place the marmots want to reach, \"jungle\", not a tool or surface that will let them get there, so option C is rejected. \n8.

Choices: A: a librarian B: a writer C: a reader D: a reader  of books E: a learner of books\nRationales: Analyze the question carefully. It talks about a man who works in a specific library. This implies that the man is likely a member of staff at the library, and works within it on a regular basis.\nOne of the many jobs that library workers might have would be to read books and provide information to the public.\nThe man therefore must be a book reader and an information provider.\nAmong the given options, only option B: 'a writer' qualifies as a book reader and an info provider. \nTherefore, the answer is B: a writer.\nAnswer: B=Writer\n\nInput: What does a honey bee do?

Choices: A: swamp B: lake C: jungle water D: meadow E: riverbank\nRationales: As winter gives way to spring, the cold days are likely to give way to warm days. Thus, by the end of winter, the trees begin to \"bud\" and bloom into spring.\n1. Looking at the question, the sentence is asking about what people will encounter at the end of winter. \n2. We need to look for options that may be found after winter. \n3. The choices are: lake (from D), meadow, and riverbank. \n4. Meadow does not seem likely to have the end of winter, as it would be the result of a warmer season. \n5. 'Riverbank' could be a natural result of the end of winter, but it doesn't sound like what people will find at that time of year, whereas 'lake' does sound like a result of the natural process of seasons. \n6. Thus, of these two options, lake seems like the most likely thing to find at that time of the year.\nAnswer: The answer is C lake\n\n### Instructs:\nRead the text carefully.

Only options C and E involve high places and a marmot would likely not have any issues climbing a jungle or a tree so the rest can be eliminated. \n5. Since a jungle refers to thick forested areas where it can be hard to see, the last two choices can be eliminated because marmots would have to climb through a difficult area where their hands cannot provide much support. \n6.

There are several options which all could be considered healthy. This doesn't help us select the best answer if we don't know the context. In this case, the context allows us to quickly determine which choice is the best.\n2. 'Banana' is the word that fits best in the question.

{"text": "says that marmots have hands that can be used to get to the top - this implies that whatever the marmot is getting to it is not the top, as if it were the top, it would need no hands.\n3. Therefore, the answer must be one of the places marmot can reach.\n4. The options are 'outside', 'hill', 'jungle', 'rocky hillside' and 'tree'. None of them are the places where marmots can be found or marmots have hands to get to the top. Only 'outside' and 'tree' are outside places which could possibly provide some other features that would satisfy this requirement, but 'outside' can't be the outside of any high places because it is itself a high place. So the possible choices are between 'outside' and tree.\n5. In a jungle there could be a high place but no marmot. A rocky hillside could have a marmot (but this is usually in the mountain not rocky hillside). So the question becomes can a marmot go up a tree?\n6. A marmot does not climb up a tree by it's own hands, but only to reach a high place to dig. It is possible that it is climbing up a tree to reach the rocky top of a mountain, but not to the top of the tree. So 'tree' is not possible as a high place where a marmot can be found. This just leaves outside to be the possible answer. \n7. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'A: outside'.\n\nAnswer: A: outside\n\nInput: You might see an antelope grazing on a high plane.

The options outside and hill could be high, but so can a jungle, rock and tree.\n7. 'B' is probably a cliff, but a cliff is not an object.\n8. So, we can eliminate option B.\n9. We can also eliminate C as rocky hillside.\n10. This leaves us with E: tree, which is an object (an object consisting of a vertical structural branching stem, usually upright, also many trees have barks, flowers, fruits, and seeds etc).\n11.

Choices: 1) Tiny Island 2) Middle of Africa 3) Outer Space 4) Pacific Ocean 5) Under your bed\nRationales: It is a trick question. The Pacific Ocean is, by definition, a very large ocean located in the middle of nowhere. \nAlso, the entire planet earth is under your bed, so it falls into this category. \nThe trick is to understand what it means for an ocean to be \"very large,\" which is something we don't explicitly define.\nTherefore, the answer is 5) Under your Bed, as this is an ocean by definition.\nAnswer: 5) Under your BED\n\nInput: Where would you like to live?

{"text": "asks what they can use their hands for.\n3. The options given can be narrowed down to \"B: hill\" by applying the first part of the question - \"high places\" - to the second part of the question. \n4. Because marmots are typically found in mountainous areas, they might use their hands to climb up a hill. However, this would only be true if the hill they are on has vegetation (a jungle) on it, and the top of it provides an \"outside\" area to climb on. A tree could not possibly provide anywhere for a marmot to climb to, and \"outside\" could be a part of any hill that provides a place to climb to.\n5.

Choices:  I: South Africa A: Australia B: North America C: China D: Europe E: Middle East\nI: '100 cogs'?\n\nRationales: If the machine had 100 cogs, the number of engines would have been higher since cogs connect 2 engine parts.  Also, '200 cogs' could suggest that the machine contains two or more engines.  Thus, it's more likely that the machine's engine number is around 4 or less.  Furthermore, there's no information regarding the engine's size.\n\nInput: In the movie, \"Robinson Crusoe\", the main character is a sailor who is shipwrecked on an island. Where was he shipwrecked?

{"text": "asks about marmot's hands, which can be used to 'get to the top'. \n3. As there are multiple 'top's in the question, we need to eliminate as many options as possible to narrow it down.\n4. Option B says marmots are found on hills (which can be considered high places)\n5. Option A is outside (where, not inside). To get to the top of the outside place, the marmot needs hands to use to grip and climb. So this option also eliminated.\n6. Option D says marmot's are found on rocky hillside, 'rocks' can be considered 'high places', however that would imply that the marmot can climb on rocks to get to the top. This is a false assumption which is why marmots can also climb on jungles because they have more things to use than just rocks. So D is eliminated. \n7. The question doesn't mention about the weather condition but it simply talks about the place where a marmot goes to, so weather can't be the reason.

{"text": "says that they have hands that they can then use to climb up what we assume is the top of wherever the marmots are found at. \n3. This implies that something tall is probably involved.\n4. Marmots usually dwell in rocky places, or inside burrows which they dig. \n5. Thus, Choice A - \"outside\" - does not make sense, as marmots don't usually go outside.\n6. Choice B - \"hill\" - might make sense, but so far this specific type of animal has not been linked to hillsides.\n7. Choice C - \"jungle\" - indicates a specific geographic place, and marmots don' t tend to be limited to one area at a time. If they were, we could infer the location that marmots would live in given the information we know up until this point.\n8. Choice D - \"rocky hillside\" might be a solid choice, if it wasn't for the fact that there is no mention of rocky slopes within the rest of the question.\n9. Choice E - \"tree\" -is unlikely, as marmots are rodents without opposable thumbs, so they would likely not be able to use tree branches to climb. \n10.

Option C: It says that they 'can use to get to the to[p]', which implies that the marmots are not able to achieve this feat using something else, like their legs. Since their hands aren't enough by themselves, we can conclude that this doesn't match the statement.\n6. Option D: \"rocky hillside\" states that they are on a rocky hillside, so they don't have to be able to get anywhere else since they are already there.\n7. Option E: \"tree\" does not have to do with anything, so it doesn't provide a good enough reason to eliminate it if other answers did.\n8.

Considering choice D: rocky hill, it has a surface of rock on which a marmot can climb. This is a rocky hillside. (There is no \"hill\" part, nor is there mention of a \"mountain\" here. A hill is shorter in height than a mountain and has a gentler slope, so it might be a different place from the rocky hillside.

From the choices, A: outside refers to outside places that are not enclosed within anything, like a house, a cave or a mountain.  Outside places usually do not have steep hills or rocks since they are not isolated ecosystems. Hence, this cannot be a place marmots can be found.\n5. B: hill refers to a hill or a part of a land which is elevated.  A hill, as you might be aware, is generally an isolated ecosystem. It is a mountainous area where various other animals reside.  Marmots are generally shy in nature and they do not prefer exposure to the outer world.  So, they must be living in a place which is away from the outer world.\n6. C: jungle refers to a natural environment, dominated by trees and shrubs, which are covered with a dense layer of vegetation. Marmots are generally considered to be terrestrial animals, and do not usually live in trees.  Additionally, they prefer colder environments that typically occur at higher altitudes.  Therefore, a jungle will not be a potential habitat for marmots.\n7. D: Rocky hillside. Marmots are small mammals, about 8 inches long. They can climb large, rocky places.  Rocky hillsides have lots of places that can provide shelters for the animals to take cover in. It is a suitable habitat for marmots, but we will be looking for a place that is generally higher on the earth.\n8. E: tree. Mammals have to depend on trees for shelter.  Marmots can climb trees to get to a higher spot.  However, it still would not be a suitable place for them since a tree is not an isolated natural habit.\n9. The best option here is B: hill.

What is the type of thing the boat is? Choices: 1. A: duck B: canoe C: boat D: canoer E: drawer 2. A: canoe\nRationales: A: duck. A canoe is a long and narrow water-propelled canoer, whereas a duck and a canoe. \nThe adjective 'canal-like' implies that the water is quiet and still. A canoe can be canoered through, though a duck's feats would appear to be more agile.\nA: canoe. A is correct because the context of the story seems to suggest that the boat is used by a canoer. A canoe can also be used and enjoyed by a family of ducks, but a boat can only transport a small fraction of so many ducks and a boat can be a canoe .\nAnswer: A) Canoe\n\n### Explanatory:Answer the following question in your own words.\n\n### Exhibition:\nInput: What is the name of the city where people work?

{"text": "says that marmots have hands that they use to get to the tops of hills.\n3. Marmots are small squirrellike mammals that are found in mountains, therefore they are very high up.\n4.

The question doesn't specify if the hands are on a hill that is inside a jungle. Therefore, choice C isn't excluded. They aren't found on a rocky hillside because the question doesn't specify that they are rocky or that they are a hillside at all.\n6. Choices outside and inside aren't mentioned in the question, therefore the only options that might work are tree and rocky hillside.\n7. Rocky hillside is unlikely to be the source as hills are not mentioned in the question. Tree is in conflict because trees are mentioned in the question, and it isn't said that trees are high, not low. \n8. Therefore, we must keep choice E: \"rocky hillside\" the least likely choice.\n9.

But even so, they can make sounds that communicate to other animals that they are nearby and that they intend to interact in some way.\nHere, since a fox is a wild animal, it is most likely to communicate with other animals using animal sounds and gestures.\nBut that's not what this question asks. This question asks about animal sounds and gestures that do not mean the same type of communication.\nLet's take a good look at each choice and figure out the best fit.\nA. The word in this option that is incorrect is \"Nothing\". In this context, nothing could refer to silence, but there are plenty of animals in the natural world that communicate in silence (and sometimes use silence as a signal to indicate the beginning or ending of a particular type of communication, without using any sound at all). What this question wants is for us to focus on the sounds different animals produce for communication.\nB. \"Woof woof\" is obviously the wrong choice for the same reason that \"Nothing\" was wrong.

All of the choices are in fact high places, but they are not the only high places: a hill, a rocky hillside, a tree.\n5. If the marmot is on a tree, it can't use its hands. Therefore, the tree option is eliminated. \n6. A hill is a high place. A rocky hillside is a higher variation of a hill that includes rocky patches.\n7. However, the marmot still has to get to the top, which likely would have to be achieved by climbing using some sort of hand-like device.\n8. Marmots have claws, but not strong enough to hold onto rough surfaces.\n9. Also, climbing is usually achieved by placing the paws against a hard surface and pulling oneself up using the thighs.\n10. Thus, we keep option C: hill as the marmot will not climb using its claws.\n11. Hill and rocky hillside are possible high places that the marmots could climb, so both rocky hillside and hill are possible answer choices. \n12. However, if we look further into the question, it reveals the following: Marmots have hands that they can be using to get to the top (NOT to climb up).\n13.

Outside is too broad and can contain too many high/low objects. Even if we restrict the question to mountains, there is still a lot of potential. For example, a mountain can be high, but the surrounding flat land is lower. Or there could be a hill next to the mountain. So, eliminate.\n6.

Does it contain other high places? etc.\n7. A jungle is something that is either on top or below the surface, as opposed to a mountain.

That leaves us with only the correct choice, \"rocky hillside\".\nAnswer: C: Rocky Hillside\n\nInput: What is done in cemeteries? Choices: \nA: Build graves  B: Dug graves C: Create gravestones D: Mark graves E: Move remains\nRationales:\n1. In a cemetery, graves could be dug, marked, and moved. The first sentence does not say the cemetery itself is created, nor does it have to be created. It could be already there.  \n2. Since it doesn't say the cemetery was created, we should be left with choices: A, B, D, and E. \n3. \"Build\" and \"create\" could apply to the cemetery itself, but \"create\" is more appropriate since the entire cemetery could be considered a single monument. \"Create\" also sounds like a broad and more accurate option while \"build\" is specific.\n4. \"Bury\" has a different meaning to \"grave\" and \"cement\" is not mentioned at all. Therefore, the only possible option in choice B that makes senses is \"Dug\", giving B as the correct answer for this prompt.\n5. \"Mark graves\" does have a similar meaning to marked graves, however, as is mentioned above the entire cemetery is treated as a single monument. The only choice that makes sense is \"Mark\" in choice D.\n6. To summarize, the options that do not make sense are choices A:  Build Graves, and B: Dug Graves.  \n7.

Out of the choices, there are only 3 options: \"outside\", \"hill\" and \"jungle\".\n6. When people are up high or on trees, \"outside\" and \"jungles\" can be seen as outside the environment of the marmot but \"hill\" can be a possible location for them to use their hands.\n7. \"Hill\" is the only possibility which fits the best as marmots can easily go uphill to get to their destination with hands. \n8. Thus, the answer to the question is \"hill\".\nAnswer: Hill\n\nInput: Why did the pumpkin change his mind, in the middle of the night, he decided to become what? Choices:\n    A: vegetable \n    B: fruit\n    C: plant \n    D: ghost\n    E: pumpkin\n\n  Rationales:\n    1. The pumpkin in the beginning had changed its mind.\n    2. He wanted to be what?\n    3. We narrow it down to pumpkin-fruits from animals.\n    4. He had a mind about becoming a vegetable or a plant.\n    5.

We can infer that the teeth of a shark are similar to human teeth.\n1. The first sentence of the question tells us that Sharks have teeth. \n2. So, we keep any three choices in our mind in which we can see the term 'tooth', which is D, teeth - a shark's tooth is the answer that matches with what we are searching for.\n3. Among the remaining options, we exclude choices A (bone), B (cartilage) and E (None of these) because sharks do not have bone or cartilage teeth \n4. From other choices, C (Skin) is also not an appropriate option as sharks are a large fish with a long finned body and their teeth are not made of skin but teeth.\n\nAnswer: D:teeth\n\n### Note\n1.

Choices: 1 answer, 2 answers, 3 answers, 4 answers, 5 answers\nRationales: Choice A: It's 1 leg. Leg is a non-countable noun so it should not be in single form. Also, leg would not be used as a plural word to count 1-5 legs. \nChoice B: It's 2 legs. Leg is a noncountable noun so no article should be added before it. Also, the use of 'no article' here could not count 1-5 lizards.\nChoice C: It's 3 legs. In English, most multi-legged animals are represented as uncountable nouns (e.g. deer have antlers) so using the word 'legs' to represent a single leg is incorrect.\nChoice D: It's 4 legs, 5 legs. This answer pattern is often used to count objects when the number is less than 5, which is the case in this instance. However, the question only asks for a number (not how many legs a lizard is). Also,'many' can't be used to mean '4' as'many' doesn't have a singular form (it's always used for the plural).\nChoice E: It's 5 legs. 5 legs is the obvious answer choice, as the question only asked for a number and since the word '5' is also singular and it's only 5 legs, there's no other word that can adequately represent this number.\nAnswer: E 5 legs\n\nInput: How does a cow get milk?

{"text": "goes on to talk about their uses, which we need to decide.\n3. The answer choices are: outside, hill, jungle, rocky hillside, and tree. \n4. Option A outside is incorrect as marmots can't use their hands to find food outside. Plus, marmots would not have hand so it's impossible for them to reach out and use hands.\n5. Option C, jungle also doesn't fit as we are told that marmots can use their hands to get to the top and the jungle is generally covered by trees, so it would be hard for marmots to stand on them.\n6. Option D, rocky hillside can be considered. But the question explicitly states that marmots use their hands to get up, so it's ineffect it to have a rocky hillside.\n7. Option E, tree, is also a viable option. This is because trees are in most natural lands and thus, marmots can easily use them to move up and down. \n8.

Choices: A: ball B: bat C: bird D: birdcage E: boxer\nRationales: This sentence sounds incomplete. It tells us what a person may enjoy finding, but doesn't tell us what the person is even thinking about finding.\n3. There are a few things that could be \"fun\" to find, for someone young. These include balls, birds, boxes, and boxes of birdfeed for a birdcage.\n10. We cannot determine what the person is thinking about because the sentence doesn't say (though there's a chance we could figure that out anyway) \n11. Of these items, \"boxes\" is the wordiest, making it difficult to see how one would find them. Therefore, we must remove \"boxes\".\n12.

Of the given choices, only choices B, C, and E refer to outside, hill, and tree respectively (which refer to things that marmots can climbed high in) while the other choices are generally unrelated.\n5. Choice A: B: outside, and C: tree are ruled out because they do not mention which part high marmots climbs.\n6. After, eliminating these choices based on 3, we have left D: rocky hill and E: tree as possible options.\n7. Rocky hillside implies that it is an outdoor cliff or hill, the only outdoor object that marmots can possibly climb.\n8. Rocky hillside is not similar in style to the first sentence, the first sentence of the question talks about marmot, whereas this sentence is about how marmot climb on the objects. This mismatch of the style makes choice D: rocky hill side as the correct choice.\nAnswer: D. rocky hill \n\nInput: If all birds of a feather flock together, where's the group? Choices:  B: the jungles of india  C: the sky D: the arctic circle E: the forests of canada\nRationales: In this sentence, \"all\" signify all birds in a flock, not a certain type of bird. \"Group\" in English refers to a unit or a set of people or things that belong together. \nBy narrowed the choices down we can eliminate choices A: jungles of indiam, B: jungles of the indiamas. \nCombining all this information, we can conclude the birds of a flock don't group together in their home country.\nSo, option D: arctic circle is the best solution to this.\nHowever, this statement is incorrect, we should change it with the correct answer; choice E: forests of canada.\nAnswer: E. forests of canada \n\nInput: What's the likelihood of people living beyond the", "answer": "E: rocks"}

Choices: 1: A: a meter 2: B: a sonograph 3: C: a meter stick 4: D: a submarine 5: E: a submarine\nRationales: First, we need to define and determine what we can use to measure the speed in the question. \n1. 'A meter' - we can't measure the speed of sound in water using a'meter'. \n2. 'A sonograph' - sonogram is a medical term used to describe imaging of part of the body using ultrasound. There is no relation between ultrasound and the speed of sound. \n3. 'A meter stick' - a meterstick can be used to measure the speed of something through the air. \n4. 'A submarine' - 'A submarine' can be used to measure sound traveling through water, however, this is used to measure the depth of ocean which is not required. \n5.

C: jungles D: grasslands E: desert\nRationales: It is clear that the question can't be asking about the most reliable place to get giraffe DNA from the giraffes. Instead, it's asking about what might be the best place to find a giraffe. \nWe don't know the size of the giraffe in the question, and even if we assume that it is large, we know that giraffes can be found in forests and jungles. \nTherefore, the following three answers can potentially be used to describe this: \n1) The most reliable place to find a large giraffe could be in a jungle, since they are very large in size and might be very rarely found in the other options. \nThis eliminates B: Savanna and E: Desert.\n2) We also know that large giraffes might be found in forests (A: Forests).\nThis choice eliminates C: Desert Grasslands.\n3) The last option is B: Jungle (C): Desert Grasslands, which suggests that large giraffs might not live in forests.\nTherefore, it's possible that the giraffes might live in trees (the question doesn't imply that they have been spotted using binoculars).

Which cheese do you recommend? Choices:  Pecorino A: Mozzarella B: Monterey Jack C: Cheddar D: Parmesan\nRationales: We must answer what cheese would be closest to the \"5% cheddar\" cheese.   There are 3 cheeses that would be closest: Pecorino, Cheddar, and Mozzarella. \n5% cheese is not a normal phrase, so we need to take that \"5%\" as an adjective that describes an amount.  According to the definition of \"5%\", it shows that anything that is 5% of some other thing is generally a small portion. \nBy using the % signs in the sentence, we know that we are dealing with 5% chedder - cheese in this sentence is the second thing that takes the percentage. \nWe have options Pecorino and Mozzarella, which are both cheese, while we have Cheddar and Monterey Jack that are types of cheeses.\n5% cheddar is a small amount, so we eliminate the one with a huge portion, which is Monterey Jack. \nCheddar is a cheese that people tend to like the most, so we eliminate the second option that can be considered as \"weird\" or different.\nIn the end, the cheese that most closely fits for 5% cheddars is actually Mozzarella cheese. \nAnswer: A \n\nInput: What are a few ways to make a sandwich?

None of the choices in the first part of the question would match that description. We could eliminate \"outside\" (no hands necessary) and \"tree\" (marmots don't live in trees).\n5. None of the choices from the second part are realistic, either. We eliminate \"rocky hillside\" because while marmots may be able to \"get to the tops\", they wouldn't have to. \n6. We then look at the final choices.\n7. We eliminate \"jungle\" because jungle only refers to a tropical or subtropical moist climate zone. It wouldn't make sense to look for an animal in an environment like that.\n8. Now we look at \"hill\". There are 2 options that can work: a hill AND a hillside. These two parts of the question imply that marmots could live on both.\n9. A: \"hill\" would be too broad to be answered because even if a marmot lived on a mountain of some sort, they could then also live on its side in the snow.\n10. B: \"hillside\" is too specific as we could never know if the marmots live on the hill itself or on the side.\n11. Therefore, we will then conclude that the correct answer is E: \"tree\".

{"text": "says that they have \"hands\", suggesting that they can use their hands to reach higher places. Since there is more than one marmot, a collective pronoun would be used if the referent would be \"their hands\", which would agree with the plural \"they\".

This information would have been provided in the original sentence if it were true.\n4. Option B: \"hill\" is the most likely candidate. Hills generally have a rocky surface and would be a place marmots would find themselves in.\n5. Option C: \"jungle\" would make the sentence odd, as marmots would not typically be found in a jungle. In addition, while jungles are considered to have \"climbing\" trees, they would be more like vines, which would be less suitable for climbing by marmots.\n6. Option D: \"rocky hillside\" would be the easiest target in terms of climbing by any animal, so it would be the most likely selection.\n7. \"Tree\" does not make sense as it would be quite out of place in terms of a high location for a marmot.\n8.

This phrase uses the auxiliary verb \"need\", which indicates the need for something/someone and is used when a question or statement asks or states something that needs to be known. \nSecond, consider the subject-verb agreement. The subject of the question is \"it\", which is plural, and the verb phrase \"which ship to meet\" is singular. To make the sentence agree with the subject, we need a singular verb, and we can only use the singular form (\"is\" or \"are\" or another singular form with the right context) with \"ship\".\nThus, \"vessel\" makes the least sense in this sentence. \nOn the other hand, both \"boat\" and \"", "answer": "B: aggression"}

{"text": "asks where marmots can be found, using the phrase \"they have hands that they can (i.e. use) to get to the top\"\n3. This suggests that the marmots' are not the only thing being referred to. \n4. Therefore, the answer can't be either \"outside\" or \"tree\".\n5. Marmots are mammals so they can't have hands. Also, marmots are small and wouldn't need hands to scale a tree. This makes choices A and B improbable.\n6.

Choices: \nA: get a bottle of water B: get a bucket C: get ready to run D: get ready to fight E: get a bucket full of water\nRationales: Answer:  - get ready to fight - a bukete full of water is needed to fight with fire - A, B, D,E have already been mentioned - thus the statement 'what should one do if a f\u0131re is seen?' is related to 'What are you told to do when fire is seen?' \nAnswer:  - get readyto fight \n\nInput: How do we keep animals from entering a house if we have pets that might attack other animals in the house? Choices:  ___________________  A: Avoid them at all costs  B: Keep calm  C: Keep the windows closed  D: Keep your eyes on the pets  E: Put out fresh food\nRationales:\n1. We keep animals from entering our house by avoiding letting them enter our house at all costs. \n2. An answer should involve keeping all or most animals from entering the house so avoiding them is best.\n3. Keeping the windows closed is unnecessary as we don't want animals inside the house and do not want to", "answer": "D: more funding"}
{"text": "goes on to say that they have hands that help them reach the top of the places they reside in.\n3. Among the options, 'outside', 'hill', 'jungle','rocky hillside' and 'tree' are all options that meet the criteria of high places.\n4. However 'outside' does not meet the requirement of a place 'where a marmot is found', so 'outside' is then eliminated as an option.\n5. 'Rocky hillside\" is an option that says that rocks are found on the hill-side where the marmots reside.\n6. A rocky hillside is typically found in a 'hill' or a 'jungle' whereas the sentence speaks of being able to reach 'top' of a location.\n7. Hence, 'Rocky hill side' does not meet the requirements of the sentence and, therefore, is also eliminated. \n8. Among the remaining options 'jungle' has a specific location associated with it and not 'top'.\n9. Also, the sentence does not require a specific place.\n10. Hence, 'jungle' is also eliminated. So, 'hill' and 'tree' remain with us. \n11.

Option D can be eliminated since it does not have any information relevant to the location of marmots. It only refers to 'rocky hillside'.\n7. Finally, option E is 'a tree'.

Choices: 1. home team\n2. winner\n3. away team\n4. loser\n5. visiting team\nRationales: Given that we have more than one choice of words to finish this sentence, we must first narrow down the possible answers that we are looking for.\nThe question asks about who played first in the football match. Let's see what we can eliminate:\n-We can eliminate 2: \"winner\", since this would not answer as to who came first (the winner or another team).\n-We can eliminate choice 3: \"away team\", since the away team would normally not be playing first in the match.\n-Choices 4 and 5 also don't work as we are not looking for either of those to happen.\n-We are looking for a choice of words that talks about \"the team who played first in a football match\". \n\nTherefore, the only answer that fits is choice 1: \"home team\".\nStep 4.

One can say the marmots have got hands, but that does not make sense if they are marmots and the context is about marmots. This leaves us with 'A: outside' and 'B: hill' as the answer choices.\n5. 'Can use them to get to the top' suggests the use of their hands. Therefore, A: outside is the correct answer.\nAnswer: A. outside\n\nInput: They were trying to get into the theater before what? Choices: A: the movie came out B: the theater was closed at 6:00 C: it started D: the show\nRationales:\n1. 'They were trying to' implies an ongoing action, so we can't use the 'before' as a future time marker\n2. 'theater came out' is incorrect because a movie cannot literally come out of a theater\n3. 'the theater was closed at' suggests the movie hadn't started.\n4. 'at' implies the time of day, so'started' must refer to the show not the movie.\n5.

Choices: B: off the track C: on the train D: off and parked\nRationales: 'The questions asks when it could'. Thus, we consider \"before it could get\" to be the time 'it' refers to and the event that is going to happen next. Since we're comparing 'to' with 'could', the train must have arrived at station.\n1. 'It might have gone off the track,' refers to 'to come off track'. We can't interpret the sentence this way because the first sentence has already stated the train pulled into the station\n2.

We could infer from what we know so far that marmots most likely live in mountains and thus \"hill\", or \"rocks\", or \"mountain\" should be the answers.\n4. However, choice \"B: Hill\" is most likely incorrect. A Hill might be a very high place but Marmots are more likely to live in high mountains rather than only in hills.\n5. Choice \"jungle\" (B) and \"cliff\" (C) is unlikely as Marmots cannot use their hands to get to the top, so they usually climb mountains using their claws. However, both choices (B) and (C) have nothing to do with using their claws.\n6.

This may be a possibility, however, this is not the most likely option as a rock is not a typical thing to encounter while climbing a mountain.\nB: sticks. Sticks are also not an expected thing for the mountain, but a single stick might not be enough to cause an injury that cannot be fixed by yourself.\nC: a stick. A stick by itself could cause an injury severe enough to require medical attention, but it is unlikely that a single stick would be present enough to cause a dangerous fall.\nD: a bad fall.

Choices:  What: A: shelter B: predator C: prey D: safety E: food\nRationales: An answer needs to be an adjective. There are only two verb choices, which are 'look for' and'seek'.

Some hills, such as volcanoes, might be located outside, making it a proper answer for this question.\n5. Option C: \"jungle\" does not describe the hands and, in any case, this environment would most likely not have many marmots.\n6. Option D: \"rocky hillside\" is a specific type of hill, and we can't assume that all marmots are found in rocky hillsides.\n7. Option E: \"tree\" is not found in high places. Trees usually grow on Earth's surface, not up high.\n8. Therefore the answer is B: \"hill\" as this could mean that marmots pull themselves up the side or top of a hill or rocky slope. Hill would be the proper answer here, not rocky slope, because while \"marmot's can be found...up [rocky] hillside\" is also true, \"marmot' s can be found in high place\" is more broad.\nAnswer: B.

Considering that the statement, 'they can use their hands to get to the top', refers to the fact that not all places in which they reside would be safe/available to get to.

What could this indicate about the temperature? Choices: A: Warm B: Cold C: Mild D: Windy E: Rainy\nRationales: A key aspect of fog is that it is a dense cloud of tiny water droplets that can significantly dampen the visibility of an area. \nThe reason that fog forms is because there is a large amount of moisture in the air, which is due to the weather being at a slightly lower temperature. \nTherefore, we can infer that when the Bay area is surrounded by fog, the Bay area will likely have a temperature that is not too hot or too cold to cause the fog to form. \n\n### Exercise 2: Complete the excerpt by altering the underlined part to make logical sense.\n\nInput: The bartender mixed the ____ on the rocks, the customers liked it and the glass of it would often be refilled.\nRationales: Because the sentence explicitly states that the bartender mixed the liquor, it does not make sense to refer to something like, \"the customers would often mix the liquor\" in the next sentence. \nTherefore the correct response is A: liquid.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: The students in Mrs. Amey's class sat down at their desks.

Choices:  I: ladder II: platform III: roof IV: second floor V: first floor\nRationales: Here are some steps that would help us complete the questions: \n1.  The question asks us to determine which risk, falling off the roof, or falling from a specific height, is more dangerous.\n2.  In this case, it sounds like falling off a roof can be less dangerous than falling from a specific height.\n3.  The fact that the latter option of falling from a specific height can be more dangerous highlights the fact that a high fall can be more dangerous than a small fall.\n4.  In other words, if a high fall can be deadly, a small fall is unlikely to kill you. \n5.  Based on the provided choices, we can determine that falling from the second floor will always be less dangerous than falling falling off the roof.\n6.  Thus, we know that answer II, platform, is the most likely answer.\n7.  Since no one would be trying to get off of a platform unless someone pushed them off of it, we can determine that answer II, platform is the right and most likely answer.\nAnswer: II, platform", "answer": "C: play piano"}

Choice (A) 'Outside' can be found on high places such as mountains. But the statement's wording makes it clear that the author is referring to buildings. \n6.

Choices: A: disbelief B: surprise C: suspension D: shock E: awe\nRationales: Analyze the question 1. This is the question for a multiple choice question. We understand that there is an extra blank that needs to be filled.\n2. There are six phrases in total with one sentence. Here we are given the phrase \"The newcomers, as well as the vetrans were.....\" \n3. Newcomers and veterans are two groups of people. \n4. Each person or group belongs to only one group. \n5. Since all the people or groups belong to only one group. They should be described in a single word. We can use the word \"were\" to connect the two groups. \n6. Using this, we know that these should be connected by \"are\" (present) or \"were\" (past). 7. Were seems to suit more in this case. \n8. Hence we are to choose option D which is \"were in awe\" 9. We are told that the group of people were in disbelief, surprise, suspension, shock and awe. \n10. However, the question is asking about one word not one phrase.

If a telescope were set up in a populated area, almost everyone might potentially see the image. \nAdditionally, in some cases, a telescope can be small enough to fit on a person's back, enabling it to be moved around easily within a house and viewed by many different people within the shared living environment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Everyone.\n\nAnswer: B - Everyone\n\n### Extension:The following sentence is not a complete sentence.

In options A: outside and C: jungle, the marmot will use its hands to help it climb out of a situation where outside/jungle is the place of shelter. \n6. We can eliminate D: rocky hill because a rocky hillside is an area found in the middle of open land.\n7.

We also eliminate choice B: hill as a mountain is the type of high place likely for a marmot and this word can refer to a smaller hilly place, so our answer choice is restricted.\n6. Choices C, D, and E refer specifically to rocky hillsides, jungles, and trees, respectively. This leaves us with very little space to work with in our answer choices.\n7. However, these answer choices do cover the places in nature that are likely for a marmot to be found on, but they do not fit the 'hands' part of the original question.\n8.

{"text": "asks about hands, and it's important that we know what hands we are talking about. \n3. Hand is a singular word, so there can be no other hands besides the ones we are talking about.\n4. \"top\" refers to a top that is somehow elevated from the ground, such as a roof, cliff face, or tall tree.\n5. There would be plenty of hands to use in a jungle, but the \"high places\" where marmots are found cannot literally be found in a jungle.\n6. \"outside\" describes a place that does not cover the entire area of the building, making it incompatible with the question.\n7. \"rocky hillside\" does not meet the requirement of being higher than the surrounding ground. \n8. \"tree\" may be higher than the ground in some cases, but it is still not a high place. \n9. Since there would seem to be more places where marmots might be found, we can conclude that \"hill\" best fits the meaning of the sentences.\n10. We can also conclude that the place from which the marmots can be seen is at the top of a hill, as hands alone would not convey the ability to ascend to a high place.\n11.

So option A should not include any of the answers which is not good.\n1. Excellent is always better than not so well. If someone exclaims \"how are you doing?\", he/she might want to know how are you really doing.\nSo the answer must include some bad news.\nSo the answer can be one of the words in option B. Option A can be dismissed as it has word \"well\" in it.\n2. Well news is not good. It can also mean bad news. So option A should include the word ill.\n3. Option A should include none of \"ill\".\n4. All the words in option A contain either of the two words: \"well; good; fine\" so option A should not include the words: \"not so well; so- so; not well; ill\".\n5. \"Sick\" means physically ill.\n6. Good news can mean great news, but it cannot mean bad news. Thus \"good news\" and \"bad news\" cannot be in the same sentence.\nSo option A should contain \"good news\".\n7.

Choices: A: the weather B: the stars C: the distance D: the direction E: the light\nRationales: \"When your eyes are glued on [to] the horizon, you can see [know] what\"? The question is asking to interpret \"you can tell what\"? Note: The horizon is the line that divides the sky or the sea from the earth.

They use their hands to help get to high places, to the top of a rock to be exact.\n5. Consider the options.\n        * Option A: outside. Outside is not a high place and marmots are not known to live outside of homes as pets.\n        * Option B: Hill. \"Hill\" is not a high place.

It may not be a high place that would accommodate the height of a mammal (such as a marmot), so this option is also eliminated. \n        * Option C: jungle.  Jungles are places that can go quite high in elevation; however, such places are not usually found where human beings keep marmots as pets, which the question states, so this eliminates C as well.\n        * Option D: rocky hill. Rocky hillside is a place where you can possibly find marmots. However, while we may find marmots living on such hillsides, marmots use rocks to get to the top, not their feet.

The word \"when\" in the sentence indicates that she is hungry at the time.\n2. The word \"grunt\" indicates that it's a noise that she makes.\n3. The word \"cubs\" is plural.\n4. The word \"need\" is singular.\n5. The cubs are eating at the time.\n6. This tells us that the sentence refers to her cubs.\n7. The sentence does not say that she's telling the cubs to find food, but that she's telling them something else.\n8. The cubs are already there, eating, right along side her. So, she is not saying, \"you're in the way, get away from your mum\".\n9.

{"text": "asks about what marmots have to climb in order to get to the top. \n3. The options given are A: outside, B: hill, C: jungle, D: rocky hill, E: tree.\n4. The context in which the question was given implies that marmots are a small animal that can have a difficult time getting to a place that can be considered high. Hence an unlikely answer is Option C: jungle as jungles are typically on the ground and not high above the ground.\n5. Further, the word \"rocky hill\" describes that the hill is rocky, thus it cannot be climbed as that would be harder, and it is not even clear if marmots are strong enough to do that. Thus, option D rocky hillside can be eliminated. \n6. Option C, outside, also can be eliminated, as the sentence doesn't mention any place 'outside' and since the question talks about going to a high place, it is not the type of area that could be considered high. \n7. The question is about marmots climbing to a high place which can be implied as a mountain which is implied by options D and E. However, a mountain is not necessarily rocky. \n8.

Option A: 'Outside' is unlikely because marmots don't typically survive in extreme cold climate. Therefore, they do not live outside places.\n7. Outside is probably the easiest option because there's no other clue so far.\n8. 'B' is hill and 'D' is rocky hillside.\n9. Hill isn't specific enough to narrow down the choices to one option.\n10. 'C' doesn't say jungle, but it does say 'hill' and 'jungle'. Therefore it is not that specific.\n11. And E says'tree' but does not say'jungle', which is specifically what the clue asks for.\n12. So the choices really narrow down to B hill and D rocky hillside. \n13. Option B is 'Hill' and option D is 'Rocky hillside'. Hill could probably be found in a rocky area.\n14.

Options C: rocky hillside and D: tree, both imply 'hands' but neither involves a 'high place' or being able to 'use' them to reach a top.\n6. Therefore the answer would be either E: hill or C: hillside, both involving 'hands' and 'high places' and allowing the marmots to 'use them to reach the top'.\n7.

{"text": "asks about marmots' hands, so it means that marmot's hands help it use the top of something.\n3. The answer choices include \"outside\", \"hill,\" \"jungle,\" \"rocky hillside\", and \"tree,\" but none of them are related to marmots' hands.\n4. So, we'll choose the correct answer for this question by finding the answer that's related to marmot's hands.\n5. The statement states that marmots can be found in high, so the only correct choice can be related to high places. The remaining answers are related to only two choices: rocky hillside and tree.\n6. Rocky hillside is not related to marmots hands because we use our hands to get to the top places, not use our hands for getting to rocky hillside. So, that means the correct choice is \"tree\".\n7. The remaining choices are outside. However, marmots don't usually go outside.\n8. So the correct match is: 'They have hands that they can us to get to the top on tree.'.\n9. \"Marmot's\" in this sentence is in the plural form. So, in matching, \"hand\" also must be in the plural form, as \"They have hands,\" so the appropriate matches will be \"their hands\" or \"their hands\".\n10. \"Marmots\" and \"tree\" are the nouns, and they should be capitalized. \"To\" and \"can\" in the question are part of speech.

We should not capitalize adverbs (like \"to\") and pronouns (like \"hands\") even though they are in the question.

{"text": "asks where marmots' hands help the marmots to move around. It is not the marmot's that do \"the hard work\", but rather the marmots' hands that do the hard work of moving to the top.\n3. \"Hard work\" implies effort and physical effort which we would not associate with outdoors because marmots are animals. So, we can consider that option A is incorrect.\n4. Jungles are typically dense forests, not high places, so this cannot be the correct answer.\n5. We don't typically consider a tree to be a high place, though sometimes a tree might be found on the top of a high place so we can't entirely rule out option E entirely.\n6. Rocky hillside implies that the ground is rough but this would not typically be high. So we can eliminate D.\n7.

{"text": "asks how could marmot's get to the top of a place.\n3. High places can refer to mountainous regions.\n4. Among the answer choices - 'outside', 'hill', 'jungle', 'rocky hillside', 'tree' - 'tree' doesn't make sense as marmots aren't known to climb trees. Additionally, trees are not high places per se but are located under high places.\n5. 'Outside' is not specific enough as it can simply refer to the entire outdoor environment.\n6. 'Hill' does not indicate where marmots might reside nor does it indicate that marmots might use their hands to get to the top.\n7. Similarly 'jungle', is not enough to be the answer. Also, it is unlikely for many marmots to be near a jungle as they usually inhabit mountainous regions.\n8. 'Rocky Hillside' could be the answer but it requires elaboration. Marmots reside in underground burrows in rocky locations. Thus, it can be inferred that rocks can be found at high places.\n9. The only answer that can be a correct answer given the information provided in the question and options is 'hill'.\nAnswer: C: hill\n\nInput: Which object cannot be used to measure how long a person spends sleeping? Choices: 1. A: candle\n2. B: yardstick\n3. C: foot\n4. D: hourglass\n5. E: ruler\nRationales: Let us analyze the question,\n1. The first sentence of the sentence - \"Which object cannot be used to MEASURE how long a person spenNDS sleeping?\"\n2. This means that there is no object in the options given that can be used to measure, it should be used to MEASURe.\n3. Hence, candle should be eliminated as it is used to SEcND candle lighter. ruler, yardstick and foot are also eliminated bcause they are used to measure an object's length or volume.\n4.

There are several options that might be high places, but only one has hands that these marmots could use.\n4.

None of the other choices match with the question, but the only suitable one is a plain old hill.\n6. Thus the answer is B: hill.\nAnswer: B : hill\nInput: Flying birds usually have stronger wings than what? Choices: A: frogs B: squirrels C: penguins D: fish E: mice\nRationales: A bird has wings and flies. A frog does not fly and has legs while not wings.\nBird has more strength in flying than a fish or a squirrel.\nFlying birds must have stronger wings.\nTherefore, the answer is A : frogs\nAnswer: A : frogs\n\nInput: Which has the longest lifespan? B: elephants C: kangaroos D: lions E: rhinoceros\nRationales: Lifespan is an objective scale of time measured by animals. Therefore, 'Longest Lifespan' should be a factual comparison between an individual animal.\n\n1. The question asks which animal has the longest life span.\n\n2. From this it is obvious that the answer has to be one animal and should not have any reference to groups or types of animals.\n3. When we compare the choices we get:-\n\n- B : Elephants lifespan is 60-70 years. But we have no idea how long lions and rhinoceros live.\n- C : Kangaroos lifespan is 20-26 years. But again, we have no idea how lions and rhinoheros live.\n- D : Lion and rhinoheroses do not indicate their life spans.\n- E : Kangaroo and rhino lifespan doesn't seem to be the largest.\n\n4.

Option D is the best answer because \"rocky hill\" is a high place where marmots can be found and have somewhere to grab on to and climb.\nAnswer: D : rocky hill.\n\nInput: A large, thick mink used to be what?\nChoices:  A: an ant B: a crane C: a coyote D: an otter E: an alligator\nRationales:\n1. The question is giving a choice between an ant, a crane, a coyote, an otter, or an alligator as the correct answer.\n2. We can eliminate answer choices B and C as these are bird species rather than mammalian ones.\n3. Thus the answer choices are A, D, and E.\n4. Although an otter and an alligator are both mammals, an otter is much smaller and thinner than an alligator. Thus, this answer choice is incorrect.\n5. A coyote doesn't necessarily look like a large, thick mink from the description of the question. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n6. Thus the answer choice is left between A and D.\n\n6.

Therefore, the hands must be made of some material that they can use to climb to high places.\n5. Only options B and C have a natural material (jungle and hill) and a man-made material (rocky hill), respectively.\n6.

Choices: 1 A: black B C: green\nRationales: In an airplane, the walls are made of plastics that give the aircraft its structural strength. \nThese plastics are usually a variety of shades of grey, from light grey to dark grey. Hence, when one is looking at the wall in an airplane, one may come across different shades of grey.\nIf the wall color is black, then the paint has faded to a very dark grey, almost black.\nIf the wall is green, then it is very unlikely because an airplane does not have a green colored surface. \nHence, if we look on the walls in an airplane, there will be colours that we can find.

However, it's likely a stretch to say that all marmots hands are strong enough to help them onto every hill. This eliminates B and C, which are mountains and jungles, respectively. Each of these places could possibly have a hill or a rocky hillside, but it's unlikely that marmots would be able to use their hands to climb onto them from high above.\n6. Out of the remaining three, tree looks most likely because the rest of the sentence is describing a place that marmots live.

Choices:  * * A: swine flu * * B: mumps * * C: measles * * D: chicken pox * * E: mono\nRationales: * The question is asking about the diseases that are possible to have in a ward. 'Empty means that all the beds are vacant.\n* The term 'the ward' refers to a hospital's area for patients.\n* There is no mention of a year or a season where this disease occurs.\n* We can eliminate C, measles, because people can't have measles in an empty ward.\n* B, mumps, and D, chicken pox, also cannot apply because they are infections that are not normally spread through direct contact. A person would most likely contract one of these infections by touching another person who has the disease. In a ward, this wouldn't occur since all patients have been seperated from each other.\n* E, mono can be eliminated as well, because that indicates that some people will have this disease in the ward already.\n* This leaves options A and D.

Therefore we are left with option D: rocky hill as the best answer.\n7. We need to understand why hills use hand to climb. If it is because their hands are very strong to reach high places using them, that is not the case, so we don't really need to use the word \"strong\" for the hands here, which is why the second answer choice D: rocky hill is the best.\n8. The remaining options could probably be true as well, but this one is the best answer because the other answers are not directly related to the answer provided in the question.\n9. The most appropriate answer is D: rocky hill.\n\nInput: The carpenter was repairing a table, she said she had to glue a piece back on. What is she missing in the repair process? Choices:  *1 A: hammer *2 B: nails *3 C: a hammer *4 D: a piece *5 E: an idea\nRationales: *1-3 It could be a hammer, a nail and a piece. All are possible\n*4 The question already states \"what is she missing in the process\". The only way to find that is to figure out the table is missing a certain piece.\nOption A would mean that she is missing a nail to keep the table together as it is glossed with a missing piece.\n*5 The only missing part is in the table to make it gloss again. Option E: an idea talks about an idea of hammering the table. So that is the best option.\nAnswer: E-an idea\n\nInput: The dog needed exercise, luckily it was warm so it could be taken for a walk.

{"text": "gives two statements about marmots: (a) they are used to high altitudes, and (2) they have hands.\n3. Now, we've gathered the information that the answer is going to contain words related to high places and hands. Also, we know that all answers could be \"high places\"-related, excepting E, which is ambiguous.\n4. We want to select an answer among the five options, so we can cross out C: jungle, and D: rocky hill side. We've reasoned that a \"jungle\" wouldn't typically have rocks on top of it, and, likewise, a \"rocky hillside\" wouldn't typically be at high altitude.\n5. Out of the remaining 3 options, we see that B and E both mean something that's outside.\n6. So we eliminate B: outside as an option because it is too general, as our answer should be specifically related to high places.\n7. We move onto E: tree. Tree comes with the same ambiguity as the other choice, C: jungle. A tree cannot be a high place. Thus we eliminate E: tree.\n8. That leaves us with only one answer, the correct answer, that could satisfy all requirements: E: inside.\n9. The next part of the question says that they have hands. The statement means that they are used to a high altitude and the key word in here is used. Their hand are used to high altitude or places. This means that they have experienced this environment of high altitude before so they do not find it difficult to adapt to a new high altitude.\nAnswer: E : Inside\n\nInput: How is it possible to learn? Choices:  a) by sitting b) by standing c) by talking d) by listening e) by touching\nRationales: In order to answer we have to find a phrase we need that can fulfill all the given criteria. The first part of the question says \"how is it possible\", so our key phrase must have both the parts : by doing X and it is possible.\nSo out of all the options, we know that only choice a: by sitting can satisfy both the conditions as we will learn sitting by doing it. Hence, correct answer is (a) by sitting.\nAnswer: a: by sitting\n\nInput: How will someone ever have time", "answer": "C: street corner"}
{"text": "asks about the use of hands to be able to get to the top. \n3. Using our common sense, it can be deduced that marmots can't use their hands to get to the top since they are burrowing in the ground. \n4. So, there must be some other place they are getting to.\n5. Of choices A-E, only choices D and E are places that are high. \n6. However, we can easily eliminate choice C since it mentions jungles and marmots can be found in high mountains.\n7. So, the options left are choice D-E. \n8. Now, choice D talks about rocky hillsides, while the meaning of choice E implies something at least as high as the height of the mountain. \n9.

The first three choices are types of evergreen trees: fir, spruce, and pine.\n3.  We exclude 'chestnut' as a choice because the question specifies that it might be an evergreen tree, not excluding the possibility.\n4.  We exclude poplar, too, since it is a deciduous tree.\n5.  So, the answer is B: spruce.\n6.  The answer does not have to be specific but should make conceptual sense.\nAnswer : B : Spruce\n\nInput: It's important to not litter.  Littering is what?

{"text": "uses a simple, logical statement about the things that marmots need to climb to reach their food with their \"hands\".\n3. The options tell us more about marmots and their climbing abilities, but to complete the statement of the question, we should look for things they can put their hands on to climb mountains.\n4. We can eliminate answer choices C, D, E.  Marmots probably can't climb trees easily because their paws are larger and not really suited for grasping small leaves from trees. \n5. Marmots aren't so likely to climb hills because hills don't usually reach the height required for marmots.\n6. Rocky hillsides might be higher than marmot food, but marmots are more than likely just climbing to the side with their front and back legs. \n7. What we're looking for is something a marmot can grab with their entire \"hands\" because marmots use their entire front limbs to climb, and they are not strong enough to pull themselves up with just their bottom paws.\n8. A marmot's front paws are large, but they are not suited to climbing trees or rocks.\n9. We can thus eliminate answer choice C, \"jungle\".\n10. If a marmot is in a jungle, that doesn't necessarily mean the marmot is in a tree or on top of a rock.\n11. Answer choice B, \"hill\", doesn't really answer the question because a marmot might also climb rocks or trees.\n12. This leaves choice A, \"outside\", and choice D, \"mountain\".\n13. If a marmot were to climb to a mountain to reach food, it would be likely to reach the mountain's outside rather than to climb right to the food. \n14. We can then conclude that a marmot would use its outside to reach the mountain in order to reach food.\n15. We can, therefore, eliminate answer D, \"mountain\", and conclude that answer choice D is \"mountain\".\nAnswer: D : mountain\n\nInput: The book was too heavy to carry, where was it being kept?

{"text": "goes on to explain what hands marmots have.\n3. It says they can use their hands to get to the top.\n4. The key part of the sentence is their ability to use their hands to reach a higher spot. \n5. So, the question is really asking for the marmot to be on a certain type of structure or elevated place. \n6. We have the following answer choices: \"outside\", \"hill\", \"jungle\", \"rocky hillside\", and \"tree\".\n7. 'outside' doesn't really give a definition beyond indicating that it's outside. 'Hill' could be a cliff or a mountain, but outside of that it doesn't really answer the question. \n8. 'Jungle' is a type of environment, not really a physical structure. A jungle could potentially be high up, but it does not have a definite meaning that necessarily supports our answer. \n9. 'Rocky hillside' is somewhat close to our answer, but it doesn't match up perfectly, as it could really refer to a high rock formation. \n10. We can eliminate 'rocky hillside' and 'tree' for this reason.\n11. The remaining options are \"outside\" and \"hill\". Outside could describe a marmot on any of the other options (including outside of a tree) and the answer is more likely to be some type of physical elevated structure.

Hence, we can eliminate them.\n2. Choice C, enormous would be the ideal answer, but unfortunately, the definition of snake does not include the usage of the word 'enormous'. It just includes'small', so it does not make sense in that place.\n3. Therefore, we are left with choice V: tiny.\nAnswer: V tiny\n\nInput: I do not believe a house should have a window. I say that a house I built would have what? Choices: I: no window II: no glass window III: no glass\nRationales: \"I say\" refers to the speaker, so whoever made the statement is \"the I\". \"A house I built\" is the speaker's house. The speaker does not believe a window in a house, so there would need to be a window to the house the speaker built.

Among the options: outside, tree, hill, jungle and rocky hillside, it is clear that outside and tree are not possible options as marmots are not found outside or in trees typically, and can't use their hands to get there. The options of hill, rocky hillside and jungle are all possible locations where someone could hide a marmot, so these need to be narrowed down.\n4. Hill: This does not really refer to a specific location, but a concept of level elevation above the ground.\n5. Rocky hillside: This is again, a broad term, but in this case, it could possibly describe a place where a marmot is found.\n6. Jungle: This is a location where a marmot could be found, but it does not refer specifically to the place it could use its hands to get to, so the option is eliminated.\n\n7.

It's not clear if this is the case or not here.\n5. Marmots are commonly found in jungles, as well as mountains and hills.\n6. Trees can be found in jungles and mountains as well. However, the question states 'high' places, not 'all' places. This points to a place where marmots are not expected to be found, that is, a jungle or a mountain that is not on the top.\n7. Hence, marmots would not expect to find rocks in a jungle or mountain, unless the description of the place meant it to be 'on the top of'. \n8. The phrase \"have hands\" implies that they have hands that are not limited to getting on top of a specific spot. This eliminates option D, because rocky hillside is a specific location.\n9. Marmots are used to both high places and jungles. Hence, we can rule out option A, outside, and option B, a hill.\n10. Marmots can be found in both mountains and jungles, this is why we cannot rule out jungle as a possibility.\n11.

Option A: \"outside\" could mean a place that is not high up at all.\n6. Option B: \"hill\" doesn't necessarily have to be high, it simply refers to a slope in the land.\n7. Option C: \"jungle\" and \"rocky hillside\" both refer to terrains which the marmots themselves live in.\n8.

We'll start with choosing an answer in one of the locations the places where the marmots can go out the outside of - \"outside\". Outside is a place where marmots could be in \"high places.\" But the outside is not the only place that the marmots could be found in \"high places.\"\n5. \"Hill\" is an option as well. But \"hill\" is not specific enough, it could mean an \"elevation of land\" that is higher in some places than others. So we can eliminate that option.\n6. It's likely that marmots aren't actually inside the \"jungle\". So they might not actually be using their hands to get to the top here, so we can eliminate that option as well.\n7. It's likely at some points that \"rocky hillside\" would have marmots at the top, and that they would need to get up and over it. But \"rocky hillside \"isn't exactly a place where marmets would gather in a \"high place\". \n8. We can also eliminate \"tree\" the same way as \"hill\". Although trees might have marmots at their top, since the word \"hand\" is used in the question, presumably only something that the marmots actually hold with their hands can be what they need to get to the top with.\n9.

However option A: \"hot\" might be appropriate, it would be possible to have a hot day while feeling happy even if it doesn't sound really logical.\nThat is why, we eliminate option A: \"hot\", because of the reason that we don't like it to be on the test.\nTherefore, the only possible answer choice is option D: \"sad\".\nAnswer: D : sad\n\nInput: Where would you find birds nesting? Choices:  a: top of trees b: in the ground c: in the grass d: in the grass e: over houses\nRationales: a: top of trees would be possible as people sometimes build bird houses in some branches/trees, so a bird could nest somewhere in the ground.\nb: in the ground might be possible as well as wild birds, but it is most likely that wild birds would build their nest somewhere in the trees.\nc: in the grass could be possible in", "answer": "B: fun"}

However, since marmots don't usually use their hands to do climbing in outside, hill, or tree, their hands may use to help them climb a rocky hillside.\n5.

Hence the answer is C: rocky hill.\nAnswer: C, rocky hill\n\nInput: The most important question to answer is what are you going to do? Choices: 1. What you're going to do first or do next. 2. How long you'll be doing it and why. 3. That you're going to try your best and what you'll do next. 4. What you like better. 5. What you can do to finish it the quickest. \nRationales: A common tactic of questions with this format is to give choices which seemingly have conflicting answers. \nThe first choice is A What you're going first or do next, while the second choice B Is how long you'll do it and why. \nThese are in conflict because the latter is in a format of how to do it while the former is what to do. \nThe third choice is C. It's what you going to try your best, and what you'll next. \nThese two points are again conflicting each other so it doesn't fit well with the question. \nThe fourth choice is D. It's what are you liking better. So in this choice, it's not what are you going to, it's what you'd like better. It can be concluded that this is not the correct choice.\nThe fifth choice is E.

Choices: \nA: sun B: rain C: rainbow D: ice E: sleet\nRationales:\n1. The question asks for \"if there is to be snow\". \"To be\" implies that an 'event' is being described, and what the answer is going to be is the 'procedural step' to cause the event to happen, as the sentence would otherwise have been \"If there is snow, what is that caused by?\".\n2. Snow requires certain 'environmental conditions' for the precipitate to have the properties it does, and what would normally be the cause of snow is the answer that will satisfy the condition, but doesn't cause the precipitate directly.\n3. We should narrow out the answer choices that are not true for precipitation as weather.\n4. We can eliminate options B, C, and E because sun, rainbow, and sleet are not precipitates.\n5.

{"text": "states that marmots have hands, and uses the phrase 'that they can use' to describe the reason the marmots can go to the high places - because of their hands.\n3. Therefore, the option that marmots use their hands on is the high place that they inhabit.\n4. The first two options, A: outside and B: hill, don't make sense, as these are not high places. Also, an outside location is not controlled by marmots, nor do they usually inhabit hills.\n5. The remaining three options, C: jungle, D: rocky hill, and E: tree, could all be considered high places or controlled at least by marmots.\n6. Jungle refers to a dense forest, so it is an option which doesn't quite fit the meaning of the statement.\n7. Rocky hillside would refer to a rocky elevation, which is a high place. Therefore, we eliminate option C.\n8. This leaves us with D: rocky hill and E: tree. \n9. The phrase 'high place' indicates that the animal might inhabit a place that's considered tall and/or hard to reach. For example, not just any mountain would do.

Choices:  N/A:  A: north and south pacific B: south and north american C: pacific and north sea D: atlantic and south sea E: south and north european sea\nRationales: This is the correct question.  We should pick the most seas from the different options, which is not the most oceans. \nThe question asks about seas, not oceans, as seen by the word \"across\" implied in the question and the word \"sea\" used in the answer choices. \nFor the answer choices, Choices A, B, and D are oceans.  Choices C and E are seas.

Choices:  C: center of the building A: in the street B: the outdoor area D: away from the building E: outside\nRationales: Consider the structure of earthquakes. At the outskirts of an earthquake, the ground appears to be shaking from a distance, while inside the building, the floor may be jumping. We need to analyze this structure when we think about the answer choices. The question in this case is asking for a theater. \n1. Option A is the only choice that fits with the question; A: in the street. In case of an earthquake while in a theater, most people run for their lives and this situation forces them to run out for the streets. \n2. B is wrong.

It is stated that marmots can be found in high mountains. But, Option D: 'rocksy hillside' is not a hill because the climbs are too steep for a marmot to go on and it's too dangerous to go up there. Thus, this eliminated option D.\n7. In mountains, there are various types of rock formations, and option E: 'tree' doesn't make much sense as marmots live on mountain-sides.

Choices: \tA: credit cards B: cash C: food vouchers D: dollar bills E: dollar coins\nRationales 1.  Analyze the question.\n2. The sentence is clearly asking for a noun that people in New York most commonly use to pay for transportation, snacks, etc. \n3. From the given examples, we can understand that the word for a financial payment must be one of 3 possible answers. \n4. So, we eliminate possibility C: Food Vouchers.\n5. We can also eliminate A: Credit card.\n6. Because, the question specifically mentions that the person paying is using the dollar bill and not the card for payment to eat transport, it would make sense to use dollar bill.\n7. There is no option in the choices that states 'using a bill for payment' directly and thus, that is why the answer can be eliminated.  This is the reason it might not be used as frequently.\n8.

A: mountain ridge B: overlook C: hill D: cliff E: beach\nRationales: This question asks for the specific location where those places could be found, not simply which places in general people could use to view the sea.\n2. Of the choices, it does not make sense for the places the question asks about to be near Mountains because mountains do not have cliffs or oceans. Mountains have mountains.\n3. Mountain is not a place to watch the sea, so it can be taken out of the choices.\n4. Hill is a somewhat generic term that does not mean \"a place to look at the sea\" so it is not the best answer.\n5. Cliff, however, is likely to be a place to view the sea.

The sun is up, which makes it obvious that they would be warming themselves as the sun is up. We can narrow down to one location, so we can eliminate:\n 1)Chair:  This is because this is the only option that is not in the grass. If the sun were up, he people in question would not need to be in the chair, as they can just sit in the grass, which would be warmer. \n2)Couch:  Same logic as the chair.

Furthermore, choices C and D are not specifically describing anywhere that you could find marmots. This information is provided in the question itself.\n6.

Therefore, the answer could be either E: a tree or C: jungle.\n8. While a jungle is probably not where marmots are usually found, they could use hands to climb up to the canopy. Also, the question doesn't ask specifically where in a jungle it is so it is still an option since it could be anywhere but it is more specific than choice C.\n9. However, the answer could possibly be a tree.\n10. There is no information stating that the tree is necessarily very high so there is no reason to assume that marmots would not be found in a tall tree. \n11.

Thus we can conclude that the correct answer is \"D: rocky hillside\".\nAnswer: D. rocky hillside\n\nInput: There exists a high value in teaching. Which of the following is true about this value? Choices:  I: The highest value can be found within the classroom.  II: The most valuable subject is teaching itself.  III: The highest rate of reward can be obtained through instruction.  IV: Offering instruction can produce a higher cost.\nRationales:\nChoices I & II do not address a value that exists but rather the existence of teaching itself, so they are invalid.\nChoice III is incorrect because there is no mention of reward in the question and even if there were, the rate of reward would not be related to the value per se.\nChoice IV: The text mentions that teaching has a high value, so offering instruction likely causes a higher cost.\nIn conclusion, Choice IV is the correct choice.\nAnswer: IV: Choice IV\n\nInput: A very low value of money:  A: cannot be given by a teacher B: not being able to teach C: having no cash D: being not worth much\nRationales: All choice apart from A is a positive value not a negative value. So it is correct that a student can give a teacher B, and this is the word in the sentence since there have to be some people who have this ability. \nA: Choice A implies that someone who has this low value would likely not be able to use money. But in reality people who can have no value in money can use it for daily spending.\n\nComment: Hi. Welcome to the site.

{"text": "asks what these high places are.\n3. We then need to consider the words: \"found in high places\". The words \"in high\" are used to modify \"places\", and so these \"high places\" can be any places that the marmots reside in.\n4. The remaining choices are: outside, hill, jungle, rocky hillside, and tree.\n5. Outside is unlikely as marmots don't typically live outside.\n6. Hill isn't used to modify any of the remaining 4 choices above. It's a standalone noun.\n7. Jaguar. These are animals, not places.\n8. Rocky hillside is a place but isn't mentioned above.\n9. Tree is mentioned, so we will eliminate outside and jaguar.\n10. That leaves us with 4, hill, jungles, and tree. \n11. Hill isn't mentioned in the passage as a place, so eliminate the second item 'hill' from the passage. The remaining items are: \"jungles\" or \"tree\".\n12. Jungles is not something that marmots can use hands to get to. Therefore, they cannot get to the top of Jungles. We can eliminate this answer choice.\n13.

Choice A says marmots \"find\" places \"outside.\"  While \"find\" is a verb, its word choice implies looking for the place rather than reaching it.  Thus, this is the incorrect solution.\n4. Choices B, C, and E are not places where marmot \"finds\" his or her.\n5. Choice D states in the same sentence that the marmot uses his hands to reach top of \"rocky hillside\".

The questions then asks for the reason that the holes are 'in the road' which refers to the location of the holes rather than their formation or function.\nChoice A means in holes for dogs meaning there are holes in the road for dogs, not holes in the road for what a dog could do.\nChoice B is not a complete sentence.\nChoice C: means holes for rainwater because of rainwater, not holes for rainwater.\nChoice D is a logical option but doesn't suit the grammer as it would be 'the road is not good' in the road rather than 'the holes in the road are not good'.\nChoice E describes what the holes could be used for, therefore the actual reason for the holes isn't 'to stop speeding drivers' but more like 'to stop something being driven too fast.'

As the given words 'live on grass' and Cows have to be outdoor  Option A: farms is incorrect. Cows may live on farms, but they do not all live on farms. That option would be redundant with Cows.  Option A and B are excluded since Cows can be found in both places.\nOption D Pastures is a large field where sheep and cows are grazed or kept. It may or may not be surrounded by a fence.

B: Hill: Marmots can climb up hills, but they wouldn't find any use of their hands except for when they are digging holes for their burrows. Thus B is ruled out.\n6. C: Jungle: While Marmots can climbers in jungles, they wouldn't have to use their hands to climb since jungles are dense to get through without hands. Therefore, we should eliminate option C.\n7. D: Rocky Hillside: Rocky Hillside is an option with many small rocks; Marmots would not find any use of their (not claws' as given in answer choices') hands in this type of environment. Therefore, we should exclude option D.\n8. E: Tree: Marmots can live on tree tops but they can't use their hands to get up there.

There are two satchels, one of money (the one that the king's daughter got from her father) and the other one is her possessions (the one she brought on her travel). \n2: 3: The first sentence with double definition of the word money is: \"I will be leaving the country when I get (receive) the money\". \"Leave the country\" could be the main verb (the meaning you are looking for) or \"get (receive) the \"money\" (the meaning you already knew) would make it a double definition sentence.\n3: 4: The second sentence with \"money\" is: \"You have given away more money that I have earned", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}
{"text": "asks what marmots use their hands to get to.\n3. To answer this, it's vital to know how marmots use their \"hands\".\n4. Option \"A: outside\" is incorrect because if marmots use their hand to reach outside, then they do not have to depend on rocks to get up high.\n5. Option \"B: Hill\" means that marmots can climb over hills. The definition of \"hill\" mentions that a hill is a landform that is higher than the land surrounding it. But, marmots don't climb over a land form, they climb up a rocky formation.\n6. Option \"C: Jungle\" is incorrect because jungle is covered with dense vegetation like plants and trees. If marmots climb on them, then they wouldn't need to climb.\n7. Option \"D: Rocky hillside\" is incorrect because if the top of a hill is a rocky formation, then it is a land feature like \"hill\", and not a \"rocky hillside\".\n8. Option \"E: Tree\" is incorrect because trees have limbs and branches instead of hand-like extremities that can help marmots climb.\n9.

Since they are able to use their hands on their way up, it can be inferred that this place is rocky.\n\n5.

Choices:  (A) being developed (B) being made (C) being created (D) being born (E) being formed \nRationales: For the purposes of this task, the use of the word 'believe' should provide a clue that the actual belief of human arrival on the planet is unlikely to be true because it would be impossible to believe something unless there was sufficient evidence to back it up. It would be uncommon for someone who is unaware of all evidence and opinions on a subject to believe there are only two options, and this sentence is structured in such a way that it appears that at least 3 other possibilities should exist.\nAnswer: (E) being formed. In addition to the clue from the word believe given above, the sentence provides clues that at least two other options exist. The sentence does not imply that the earth is only 12 years old, and is likely to have existed for much longer than that.\nThe word formation suggests that there are many possible variations of events to the arrival of humans. Humans were being formed and arriving at different rates, at different locations throughout 'this planet', which could be 'this planet' at that time or it could refer to all", "answer": "D: cross road"}

However, the options still do not match as per the sentence, as the sentence is talking about what marmots can use their hands for while options are general that could be used by any animal to climb up a place.\n5. To determine the answer, we must consider the fact that marmots' hands are used for getting to the top. They use these hands to pull things up on the top.\n6. There might be some vegetation like trees growing there, however we cannot be sure of presence. \n7.

Among these features, jungles and hills typically contain trees. We cannot use tree as we don't have enough information to support the meaning \"at the top\".\n6. Similarly, rocky hillside can also have trees.\n7. Therefore, the only options that fit are A outside and B hill, making these the most likely places where marmots would have something to use as hands to get to the top.\n8.

The same can be said about the choices \"hill\", \"jungle\", \"rocky hillside\" and \"tree\", which all have the potential to be considered inside places.\n6. So the answer has to be one of two: a high place where marmots can get to using their hands can be considered as being either \"outside\" or \"hill\".\n7. For the choice \"hill\", we need to clarify what part of the hill marmots are trying to make use of.\n8. If the marmots are looking to get to the top, then we should rule out \"rocky hillside\".\n9.

We also know that they must be near some form of \"high places\", which rules out option B (high hill).\n5. Options C and D suggest that there is likely a jungle or tree somewhere. We can cross that out, as the question mentions high places. \n6. We must not eliminate option E because a rocky hillside may contain many high places, which would be appropriate for finding marmots.\n7.

B: hill and D: rocky hill imply that the marmot is going to be going up high in a mountainous area. We can narrow it down to rocky hillside or hill because it's difficult for a marmot to dig its way through a hillside or dig its way through rock to climb up to the top of such a structure.\n8. Therefore only two options that can fit this description are left: B: hill and E: tree.\n9. Hill and tree are the only options that have the necessary qualifications. \n10.

K: plains - The tree would likely be found on the plains as it is in a wide and wide-open space.\n2.

However, it can be deduced that choice A: outside is not suitable. Outside could be high or low, and 'outside' has some kind of general vagueness to it, which isn't really useful for figuring out what the marmots are using their hands to climb.\n5. In addition, choice B: hill is vague and the clue given suggests 'rocky hillside', which can rule out choice B.\n6. Choice C: jungle has a more specific meaning regarding the physical structures available, however, we have just eliminated a place with a 'hill'.\n7.

Choice:  A: pina colada B: cappuccino C: soft serve D: tonic water E: iced tea\nRationales: As indicated in the title, the boy asked for \"a shake\".\n\n1. The sentence makes it clear that he was only after a shake, and therefore we can infer he didn't want any specific type of shake (like cappuccino, iced tea, or tonic water).\n2. This means the only options he could have been after is A: pina coladas (in the sense of a shake) or B: soft serve, which can be considered a type of shake.\n3. We can eliminate C: soft serve as it does in no way suggests it could be confused as a \"shake\". Similarly, as it is not a common name for \"shake\", option D: tonic water, cannot be the answer either.\n4. This leaves us with options A (pina coladas) and B (soft serve).\n5. The word \"shake\" is not commonly use to describe a carbonated or bubbly soft drink, it is typically used to the describe the milkshake, ice cream shakes, etc.. Considering the choices (A) and (B) from the options above, in general a shake is a cold or frosty beverage, this indicates that the boy is after a soft drink option ( B: soft serve ) which supports our assumption.\n6.

The question does not mention which one it is so we cannot eliminate these by rule. \n8. As Marmots live in cliffside/mountaintop terrain, we would prefer to include mountains as an option.\n9. As \"hills\" could be found anywhere, it would make the question more difficult to solve if it was considered as a suitable option.\n10. \"Outside,\" in this sense, is the same as \"mountainous\" but harder to prove that it doesn't include trees, so we don't want to eliminate \"outside\" from consideration. \n11. As we want to eliminate options that are unlikely to be considered, we eliminate \"jungle\" because it is clear the answer isn't a jungle, nor a place that includes jungle.

However, none of these places are likely places where the speaker would first think to find a fox unless they are very uninformed about the subject.\n1. A desert is a likely place to have a fox, but it is more specific and unlikely compared to the overall intention of the question.\n2. A meadow also seems like a possible place, but this word could mean many different things, and the question is only looking for the most likely place.\n3. Grassland is also a possible place to find a fox, but, again, it doesn't offer an expected range of expectations in terms of location.\n4. Woodland is another possible place to see a fox, but the speaker is likely not thinking to find a fox in this area. For example, when you say you're going to town, you likely don't think about finding a fox when you get to town. Instead, you think about specific things like stores you want to purchase something from or other specific locations.

{"text": "refers to the marmot's ability to climb to the top of something using their little hands.\n3. The only logical interpretation of that sentence would be to climb rocks or trees. That is because marmots cannot climb hills, as these are flat on top. A hill is simply a raised mound that is more prominent than a mound of the same height.\n4. It is also important to note that the sentence does not mention'marmots' directly, but rather 'they', so 'they' refers to'marmites'.\n5. Choice E: 'trees' has nothing to do with this question. Therefore, we eliminate it.\n6. Choice A: 'outside' is also not the correct answer because marmots cannot be found outside in the open. They usually prefer dark, secluded places like caves, rock piles, underbrush, etc.\n7. Choice B: 'hill' does not describe how marmots can climb to the top, as we have already established that there is nothing on top of a hill.\n8. Choice C: 'jungle' makes sense as this refers to a type of environment where marmots naturally reside. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that they can climb jungles, so they simply cannot move through all jungles.\n9. By combining all of this, the best choice for the answer is D: 'rocky hillside'.

'Rocky Hillside' doesn't include the word \"top\", but implies a rocky, mountainous place on top of the hill if the word \"hillside\" has to do anything with 'top'/'mountain'.\n8. Therefore, among the choices, the most likely place for the marmot to use its hands (or 'paws') would be E: Tree. As the word 'tree' implies a place on top of a mountain/hill.\n9. Further, we exclude options 'Hill' and 'Jungle', because the question does not specify that marmots can only use the \"hands/paws\" if there is a tree available and marmot could just use their \"hands/paw\" else also with other places as well and jungle doesn't include the 'tree'.

{"text": "says that they have hands that they can \"use\" to get to the top. This suggests that \"use\" isn't necessarily the most appropriate word choice in this sentence, as marmots probably aren't using their hands in the way humans do.\n3. Therefore, we should look at the answer choices, which all start with the letter B, and consider the word \"use\".\n4. Option B: \"hill\". \"Hill\" is the lowest option, as the other options are all mountains. However, the question asks what the marmot is using their hands for, and there is nothing at the top of a hill that a marmot needs to get to. It would be easier to reach the top of a mountain than a hill. Therefore, we can eliminate option B.\n5. Option C: \"jungle\". Marmots are rodents, and so we would expect them to be found in places with dense vegetation, such as a jungle. However, this is not specifically indicated in the passage. Thus, it becomes unnecessary to add more info and thus is irrelevant.  Hence, it is not the answer.\n6. Option D: \"rocky hillside\". A rocky hillside is a natural formation often found on mountains. As the question specifies that the marmot can use its hands to get to the top, we can infer that a similar formation that offers a climbable surface would be acceptable.\n7. Hence, we can eliminate two of the options and say that none of these are the correct option.\n8. Coming to option E: \"tree\". Marmots are small rodents and so are not usually found in tall trees. We can also eliminate several other answer options by eliminating those with \"hill\" as their first word, as we eliminated this word previously.\n9. Thus, the answer choice that fits best in this sentence is option E: \"tree\", which is the only thing a marmot can climb to get to the top: a tree.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: The fish swam over several bodies of water, it was never found where?

The word 'use' in this sentence refers to the way we use it (informally), not to the way a marmot uses its hands.\n3. The sentence gives two options, that is, a hill and a rocky hillside. A rocky hillside refers to the type of thing you use to climb down. We need to find something that is used to climb up. \n4. 'B' refers to the outside. But it doesn't fit. Thus, it can be eliminated. 'C' refers to a jungle. But again it doesn't fit the statement fully. Thus, it can also be eliminated.\n5. Among the remaining options, 'D' refers to a tree, a flat object. But a marmot has hand. Hands are used to climb up, not go down. Thus, option 'D' is not the right answer.\n6. Option 'E' refers to a rocky hillside, which can be used to climb up or down. But if a marmot is in a jungle, where it is supposed to go, then it would not have to come out to use the rocky hillside to climb up.\n7.

We want to guess at the meaning of 'taste' in the given context.\n3. Since \"like\" in this sentence is a preposition and not conjunction, it implies that what tastes like something, is the same type of thing. As a result, the response should only be an answer that is of the same type as the sentence.\n4. None of the options listed in the choices are of the same type as given in the sentence (i.e, not all are animals), eliminating A: salad, B: chicken, C: steak. \n5. \"Carcass\" can be an animal so eliminating D: meat and E: carcass.\n6.

No. The 'twisted' referred to here by the doctor would happen when the doctor is treating for the wound.\nChoice B: because of the wound. No, since the doctor asked, \"why?\" immediately after saying \"because of the wound,\" we can deduce that this is unlikely.\nChoice C: because of the way you are standing. No, since the above options have been considered and eliminated, we can eliminate this option.\nChoice D: because of the angle.

First, it is asking about where a doctorate degree might be obtained. Second, it is asking about what it might be a challenge obtaining.\nWhen narrowing down the answers, each choice must account for both parts, so that a complete match must exist.\n\nThe doctorate degree is a higher-level education, and so it should include the highest educational level as an option. College fits this criterion.\nThe second part of the question tells us that this could be a challenge to obtain. Given this criterion, we can narrow down to the options that are most difficult.\nCollege is a higher level of education, but it could be a challenge if you are not well prepared. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\nHowever, high school and grade school are much lower levels of education, and it is likely that obtaining any degree there would be a challenge. Furthermore, there are typically classes throughout highschool and grade school that have to do with a specific subject or field. For example, there would be a class called biology throughout highschool or grade school, which would be where you take your biology class. Given these contextual cues, we eliminate high school and grade school as there is no indication as to what type of class in the latter two levels of education could provide the most challenge in obtaining.\nTherefore, the options that remain are University and Middle School.

The only real possibility is between 'hill' and 'jungle' at this point.\n5. Hill would be the better choice since jungles are unlikely to be found at high elevations. \n6. Hill also tends to have less vegetation as the sunlight gets less as we go higher. This wouldn't make sense compared to a tree option. \n7.

Choices: A: to learn B: to study C: to use D: to be read E: to read\nRationales: Considering that the question is asking for the \"most common way of using a BOOK\", it should suggest that using a book for the sake of learning is not the most common way (or, most likely). \n1. Considering all the options, only uses that'study' or 'use' a book are common because the book itself is not meant to be read (to be read is, in fact, the MOST likely way of using a book - see Option E). \n2. Therefore, we have to eliminate options A, C, and E because they are not common uses for a BOOK in common day to day language. \n3. If we are talking about a BOOK, not a paper, it is most important to study the book (as it is a learning tool), rather than simply read it, which is why the answer for the most common way of using the book is'study it'. \n4. Since the question is stating that we should be looking for the most common way in common day to day speech, we should consider that book", "answer": "B: night sky"}
{"text": "asks about the places where marmots can be found.\n3. Options A,B,C talk about places where marmots could be found, but there is no mention of their hands. \n4. Option 'D', which is 'tree', does not make sense because of the following reasons:\na. Marmots cannot climb into a tree;\nb. If they could, then the question of their hands would not make sense because to climb into a tree, they would not require hands.\n5. Option E, which is 'rocky hillside', does not make sense, as marmots are not known to live/climb on hill slopes.\n6. These reasons make option E as the least likely choice. We combine this with option D and it becomes clear that the answer is option D, which is 'hill'.\nAnswer: D: hill\n\nInput: What was being sold? Choices:  B: jewels A: money C: stock D: gold E: rocks\nRationales: \"What was being sold?\" implies that the choice options are things that were being sold.\n1. Since the choice options do not include \"money\" the answer to \"what was being sold?\" is B: \"jewels\".\nAnswer: B: jewels\n\nInput: Where would one likely find a bookmark? Choices:  E: on a stack of books C: library A: bookstore F: at an office B: bookstore\nRationales: For options A, B, C, D: books is not a subset of the given options and therefore can safely be eliminated. \nFor option E: stacks are not items and thus do not belong in the options.\nOption E is eliminated from further considering. \nFor Option A: bookstores are a subset of books, thus books must be a subset of bookstore. Books are not library books and library books are not part of a bookstore therefore library does not belong in the list of options.\nOption F: office is a subset of books, therefore books must be a subset or office.  Thus office does not belong in the options either.\nWe conclude that answers to \"where would one likely find a booksmark\"? is \"B: bookstore\", which is the only choice in the list that allows both \"books\" and \"booksmark\" can be true at the same time", "answer": "B: singing"}
{"text": "asks what marmots might have to 'get' to the top of, which implies that there must be something at the top that marmots need to get to.\n3. The first three options: \"outside\", \"hill\" and \"jungle\" don't have anything at the top that they would need to get to. This means that marmots would be able to go on a walk on these surfaces without having to use their hands to get somewhere.\n4. The remaining choices all include some kind of surface or land feature that has something at the top that the marmots would need to 'get' to: \"rocky hillside\" and \"tree\".\n5. However, \"rocky hillside' doesn't explicitly mention anything marmots would need from it at the top. It simply describes a rocky surface with a hill at the top, so marmots don't necessarily need something at the top in this scenario.\n6. The last option, \"tree\", clearly states that marmots would need 'branches' from trees at the top to climb. This clearly gives a logical path to the answer: if there's something at the top that a marmot would use their hand for, they would use a tree. \n7. Thus, the answer must be \"E: tree\".\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: My pants are long and white, they fit me like a glove.

I put/have (something) over them.' \nIn this case 'put/have (something) would be describing what the speaker wears 'on top of' their pants.\nFrom the options above, 'pair of socks' and 'long underwear' are things that are worn on top of pants.

Option 'E: Tree' is also too broad to make sense as it talks about hands and marmots, not about the place where marmots use their hands.\n6.

Choices:  a. slim b. tall c. flexible d. agile e. lean\nRationales: In this question, the phrase \"pretty neck\" refers to someone who has an attractive neck due to its shape or lack of blemishes.\nTherefore, the answer is someone who has an attractively shaped neck and/or is free from blemishes.\nComparing the attributes of the answer options, option B: \"tall\" doesn't make any sense here. \"Tall\" does not mean attractively shaped or free from blemishes, which are the key criteria. Likewise, \"slim\" also doesn't make sense here, as it can refer to someone who is underweight, which wouldn't be an attractive characteristic.\nComparing answers C and D, \"flexible\" and \"agile\" have the most meaningful relationships to a \"pretty neck,\" as the latter refers to an attractive neck in the sense that it moves gracefully.\nHence, the answer is E.

If hill is considered by the speaker to be high, it will also apply to hillside. So, we keep these together.\n6. Jungle is also pretty high in elevation, but this doesn't make sense since the speaker is not discussing marmots that come out of the jungle. So, it's eliminated. \n7.

{"text": "says that these animals have hands that they can help them reach the top of...\n3. The meaning of marmots is a small ground squirrel-like animal found in woodland or rocky areas, typically inhabiting an underground burrow.\n4. The key words here will be ground squirrel-\"marmots can be found in high areas and have hands. That's exactly what squirrels have\". These creatures have claws to help them grasp, and they have nails in the fingers, where fingers and thumbs are connected.\n5. Squirrels do not have paws or hooves to help them climb. Squirrel have sharp and tapered nails, which aid them with grabbing and clinging onto an object.\n6. Also, the fact that this animal lives in high places implies that it would want its front paws that would allow it to dig, scurry and grasp things on its way.\n7. So we know for sure that this creature needs \"hands\" that's why \"A: outside, B: hill, C: jungle, D: rocks, E: tree' - A, B, E are in the wrong part of the question, while C has a lot of obstacles for that little fella.

This means that it is not a book store. Additionally, it also does not serve as a school, university, class, store, or bookcase.\n\nAnother important thing to observe is that while a bookstore usually sells books, the word \"sells\" is not used in this sentence.\nSimilarly, even if books are stored in the library, it does not mean that books are also sold there.

The answer choices are as follows: outside, hill, jungle, rocky hillside and a tree.\n5. 'outside' can't help us to get to the top as it isn't a place in itself.\n5. 'hill', 'jungle' and 'rocky hillside' each refer to places that can be found in high-elevation and the word'marmot' also refers to a mountain mammal. So they are not a suitable pairing.

Side wall (SW) has several options including (A), (B) which is illegal, and (C) and (D) are legal and incorrect because you wouldn't have a ball going from a side of the court to a side wall.

A'mountain' is likely to be too high as'mountains' are typically greater than several thousand feet or other units of measurement.\n7.

Choices:  B: pool A: billiards C: skateboarding E: basketball F: ping-pong G: bowling\nRationales: We must first eliminate option C: skateboard. Skateboarding is performed on a special board that is not meant for another purpose. Also, skateboarding is a recent activity that isn't that popular in the United States or Canada. Finally, it is unlikely that sharks bet on a thing as expensive as a skateboard. \n4. We must then eliminate option D: basketball. Basketball is a sport but sharks cannot play basketball. In addition, only in Canada and the United States basketball is the most popular. \n5. To make the statement correct, a pool or bowling game must be picked, but both are not possible.\n6. There is a huge difference between the terms pool and billiards. Pool is a recreational activity wherein the participants are involved with playing a game. Whereas, billiards is a recreational activity, wherein the participants are mainly interested in becoming involved in games. \n7. Option B says the game is billiards.

Choices A: garden B: kitchen C: garage D: woods E: marketplace \nRationales: What the question is asking is which of the options where the kit'most likely to be found'. Let's break down that idea: we can eliminate E: marketplace.\n1. You won't find a kit at a marketplace.\n2. Garden - you *might* find the kit in the garden; however, this may be unlikely as you may be in the garden to water the plants and the kit would likely be in a separate place\n3. Kitchen - unlikely to find it in most kitchens. Beekeeping kits involve making the hives and you would only be doing that outdoors.\n4. Garage - unlikely to find it. Same as kitchen and you may just be in the garage to work on your car rather than making a hive\n5. Woods - unlikely to find it as you are more likely to make the hives on your own property and not in the woods.

Out of these choices, only the tree option fits the statement correctly: marmots can indeed be found in high trees and they would have to extend their hands up from their body to get to the top, as the tree is higher than marmots can comfortably position themselves without making an effort.\n5.

He claimed that the tooth fairy left a huge amount of money and jewels under her pillow. What had he done to prompt her to behave this way? Choices: \tA: stolen some things B: made fun of his sister's wishes C: hurt his sister D: told her about how much bigger his room was E: teased her about being a girl\nRationales: This question asks about the boy's unusual story. His claim implies that the tooth fair\ni left a huge amount of treasures under his sister's pillow because of something that he had done. \n6. So, we need to look at the choices and see if they represent something the boy may have done to prompt the tooth fairy's odd behavior, or if there's another option which can only be reached by a process of elimination.\n7. From the choices, we see that the word \"promoted\" in the question is used instead of \"prompted\". \n8. We also see that the boy made fun of his sister or used teasing behavior to speak to her in the story. This matches with \"promoted\" in a general sense which gives a clue that the boy may have made fun of his sister to make her do something he wanted her to do, like, leave a huge bunch of treasure under her pillow. \n9. But, \"hurt his sister's wishes\" is a more specific action (hurting is usually done by physical actions), whereas the boy probably wasn't physically hurting his sister to make", "answer": "A: television"}
{"text": "continues by saying that they have hands that they can \"use to get to the top\", which is describing their behavior and indicates that they use those hands to climb to the top of something to live on.\n3. Climbing to the top of a high place is a physical action, and thus we exclude choices A: \"outside\" and B: \"hill\".\n4. When climbing to the top of something, they use their bodies, not their hands, making choice C: \"jungle\" unlikely.\n5. The last choice: \"rocks\", suggests that the \"rocky hillside\" is somehow related to a higher place, but it is not necessarily physically related to the marmots. In that case, it doesn't provide enough information to answer the question, making E: \"tree\" an unfitting choice.\n6. As a physical action, the marmots have to live on something, for the purpose of answering the question, so any of the other options can no longer be eliminated.\n7, Choices E: \"tree\" and D \"rocky hillside\", however, are physical things with a surface that can be climbed, which indicates that they need to be considered carefully.\n8.

With that said, the city being a distant place makes the questions in nature, is. So the question is asking about the nature of the distant city.\nNext, we'll move on to the first part of the question, where the best description would be one that is most related to its nature.\nAs each word is a bit different in meaning and can describe any city, the best", "answer": "E: university"}

Option D: \"rocky hillside\", implies the presence of mammals, hands, and rocks.\n7. Option C: \"jungle\" doesn't make much sense because jungles are not high places.\n8.

Q: Were a few people invited?\nA:  B:  C:  D:  E: \nRationales: For the first question, we see that the housewarming event was organized either by the neighbors or by the owners. We rule out A because it doesn't make sense for people to invite themselves for a gathering or party. Therefore, we can say that the answer is definitely not A. \nNext, we move onto the second part of the question, where we are asked if a few people got invited. There are multiple options saying that people were invited, which is why the first part of the question is asking if the housewarming was organized by the neighbors or the owners.\nThis means that B, C, and D are options that describe when many people got invited in the second part. \nOut of these options, B is the only option that does not describe specifics of how many people got invited.\nThis is because B is the only option for the second part of the questions that only asks if few people got invited.\nThe other options all have numbers or specifics about the number of", "answer": "D: earth"}

Since the question asks for a \"small chance\", which means one that is unlikely, it makes sense to eliminate options B and D right away. B and D are opposite in meaning to the question. \n2. Options C and E can also be eliminated, since both of them do not make sense for an answer. It will be confusing to speak about \"ant's intelligence\" or some such thing since you can't tell the difference between ant's intelligence and ant's \"smartness\". Also, there are no such things called \"strength\" or \"stupid\" ants. \n3. Therefore, let's look at options A (Big) and B (Smart). B sounds odd, and it doesn't have anything to do with why ants are considered unlikely. This eliminates B.\n4. This leaves us with two options: A (Big), and A (Smart). The word intelligent sounds much more likely than the word smart. However, it is possible that people associate the word intelligent with some kind of consciousness or self-awareness.

{"text": "asks what marmots use their hands to climb to the top of.\n3. \"Top\" implies a high place, it does not imply the \"top\" of a certain object. \n4. Further, we can see that the other answer choices except marmot's hands do not involve climbing to the top of anything.\n5. We also see that 'hill' is a possible answer. Many animals climb high places to protect themselves from danger, for this reason, it is possible that marmots need strong pairs of hands to protect themselves.\n6. If hands were not strong enough, the other answer choices would not be possible.\n7. This narrows down the choices to A: outside (open-air environment) and D: rocky hill.\n8. A: outside is not the only possible thing that marmots will be found on.\n9.

Thus eliminate X. Y is a park, a park is one of the places that people go to, but it is not a place where people live. Thus Eliminate Y. Z is a street.

For example, \"outside\" is not on a hill and cannot be used to describe high places, and a tree is not likely to be used by a marmot to get to high places and is not related to the ability described in the sentence.\n6. Also, \"hill\" can be used to describe both high places and low places, so it is not helpful in this situation. \n7. Therefore, the answer to the question is a rocky hillside.

The options given are: \"brain\", \"body\", \"mind\", and \"love\". The location of a person's heart after being broken is not related to any of the options given.\n2. Option A: \"brain\" is not appropriate because this is not a location where a person's broken heart would end up. \n3. Option B: \"body\" does not match this situation as a person's heart may not be within the body if it is broken.\n4. Option C: \"mind\" does not give an appropriate address as a broken heart is not a thought within the mind of a person. \n5. Option D: \"love\" is a possibility as people often find broken hearts due to love. However, this is not stated in the question. \n6. Considering all of these points, we can conclude that an appropriate answer is L: \"stomach.\" This is because a person's heart will often be in their stomach if it is broken, as people commonly experience broken hearts after they have been rejected or had their love ruined.\nAnswer: L: Stomach\n\nInput: Where would a chameleon most likely be found?

He says \u201cMy family\u201d.\n4. We need to find a word beginning with the letter M and describing the musician\u2019s family.\n5. We can eliminate option D, musical program, because it is not what the musician\u2019s is. Option E: musical instrument, musical is not what the family\u2019s name is.\n6.

We need to work out the distance between each of the distances in the answer choices.\n2. As the problem says \"A large animal might often require\", the answer choices are referring to the different sizes that large animals could potentially have.\n3. Between the distances of 50 acres and 500 square acres, it is clear that acres is only bigger than square yards. This leads us to eliminating 500 square square yards and 500 acres.\n4. In the same way, we find that the distance between 50 meters and 500 meters, which indicates that meters is only bigger than yards, which are all eliminated in the first step.\n5. Now, in feet, we find that the answer choices go from 50 square feet to 500 square yard in intervals of 1 and 2, which means that all values of yard are greater than all values of feet.\n6. Consequently, based on this, we eliminate all answer choices that are feet and those that are yards - we have four remaining options.\n7. As yard is bigger than meter, 500 yards is bigger than 500 meters. If yard is bigger than meter and meter is bigger than feet, it is clear that 500 yards must be the bigger choice.\n8.

Choices:  (A) sell the bills to the public (B) give them to the public (C) raise the interest (D) change the term of the bill (E) reissue the bill\nRationales: (1) The question is referring to a company that is working to get rid (or reduce) their bills. \n(2) The company has decided to take what approach or method to reduce their bills (which is the task of the sentence).\n(3) The approaches available to them are: (A) sell their bills to the public, (B) give them the bills (give them to the public), (C) raise the interests, (D) change the terms of the bill, (E) reissue their bills.\n(4) 'Selling' the bills to the general public is actually an appropriate answer for the question, but it is not possible for it to be the only option because we cannot have 2 options from the same set of answers.\n(5) In (6), 'Change' is an action/verb. Thus, 'change THE term of the bill' indicates that the specific term has to be changed.\n(6) It is also not possible for 'give' to be the only option, as this is not a real option anyway.\n(7) Therefore,'sell' is the best answer for the question and the best answer is \"A: sell the bills to (the) public'.", "answer": "E: petrify"}

In order to identify the correct option, we need to identify what is meant here by replace a roof.\nThe options given are A. Buying new sheets of asphalt, B. Hiring a roofing company, C. Replacing with new shingles, D. Installing flashing, and E. Recoating the entire roof.\nOption E. Recoating an entire roof: This is not what replace refers to. What is meant is that we need to replace a Roof that is in an old building. Option E cannot be the answer.\nOption D. Installing flashings is done during a roofing process. Replace means that you would do so with a new roof that looks different from the current roof. If a person was already replacing a roof, installing flashings would be a redundant step. Hence, this is also not the answer.\nOption C. Replacing a Roof with New shingles makes sense as the term replacing is used. It is also more financially viable than the other two options. Hence this is a viable option.\nOption B. Hiring a Roofing Company: This choice is used to refer to an entire roofing process. There is an implication that the roof is older and requires additional repairs. The roofing company will take care of it but not change the look of the roof. Hence, this choice is incorrect.\nOption A. Replacing it with new sheets of asphalts, is also incorrect. Replacing means to install a new roof. This needs a whole process that costs money and time and also requires the roof to stop functioning. \nSince the question is about simple replacing, we can eliminate all the above options except for C.

We can't place jewelry in regular drawers as they might get damaged easily. In some other sense it may cause harm to the jewelry by keeping it in an inappropriate place wherein it might get broken. Drawers may be kept in a closet which may cause the jewelry item to deteriorate faster. There is also a chance of the user losing their jewelry while cleaning the closet. This makes option 'C' - a drawer - unsuitable for the given context.\n4) Option 'B' - a jewellery box is typically the safest way to store your jewellery.

So A-E can be shortened to A-D or A. Next, we check in each choice: \nWhen it comes to the word'many', the word \"plenty\" can be excluded (this word has a different meaning). Also, the word'shade' in the question indicates either the shadow of the tree (which cannot cover all people) or a particular type of shade. Therefore, the answer B does not make sense. Similarly, we check the word \"a few\". We do not say'sit under a tree for a few days' or'sit under a few trees' but we say'sit in the shade of the tree for a few days'. Thus, this has to be only a single tree. Additionally, if it was a few trees, it would make the word'many' redundant. Furthermore, the word'many' cannot be replaced with 'a few' in the sentence. Therefore, the answer C is incorrect.\nWithout \"plenty\", \"many\" has no clear replacement, as we can say (for example) \"sit in the shades of the tree for many days\" or something similar, implying many shades - \"many\" has already been used in the sentence, so it cannot be replaced.

This means that the hill must be a low hill otherwise we would be able to infer that because of the high places marmots live in, they would be climbing taller hills than normal. Thus, this is not a good option.\n7. Option C \"jungle\". This is a place marmots would prefer to stay in, which means that the other options, being outdoors or hill, could potentially have the opposite effect, which is not what the author indicates.\n8. Option D \"rocky hillside\".  While this gives us a clue that marmots are climb- ing high up, it also indicates that they are on hillsides. Based on what marmots live in and the information given in the statement, we can conclude that marmots could climb up a mountain to some extent, so this is not a good choice either.\n9. Option E \"tree\". This doesn't really make sense as marmots are herbivorous mammals, which means that their diet is based on plants  meaning that they do not usually climb trees.\n10. From these factors we can conclude that among the answer choices, only option \"E: tree\" makes sense and the answer is E: tree.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: The fish has a big fish mouth.

A: because the shark's tail: The second sentence is stating that The shark has a \"huge mouth\", so \"large mouth\" is a contradiction to it.

{"text": "says that marmots have some type of hands they can use to get up there.\n3. The second question, \"What can they use to get to the high places?\"\n4. We can eliminate choice A: 'outside' quickly. Marmots are very adverse to the outside temperature, and don't venture out. If they had hands, they could use them to get into a hole or burrow they made themselves (and not climb), but it would probably be much less likely compared to a tree or other things growing in the high places.\n5. Choice B: 'hill' can be eliminated. 'Hill' cannot be used interchangeably with 'high place', even if it is higher in elevation. It has to be a high place for the marmots to be able to use their hands.\n6. Choice C: 'jungle', is out as well. Marmots in jungles are likely to be eaten by the larger animals that live there, such as lions or leopards, so they have no need to climb.\n7. Choice D: 'rocky hillside', can be dismissed. While rocks may allow for places to climb on, in general, marmots would not choose to burrow among rocks due to their large, heavy bodies and the danger rocks typically present. \n8.

Choices: A: book B: poem C: essay D: prose E: novel F: story\nRationales: A book is a literary item that can be divided into chapters and sections. An essay, however, cannot be divided into multiple paragraphs. Books are also usually bound, whereas an essay can be found in many different forms. \nA novel is a type of book, whereas a poem or prose are not. A novella is also a type of book, but a tale or a story cannot be called as a book. Thus an answer like F or E cannot be correct.\nA novel is a narrative that has multiple chapters whereas a tale or a story does not have that many chapters. Thus we can eliminate any choice with'story' or 'tale'.\nCombining this, the only remaining option that can be considered possible is 'novel'.\nAnswer: A: novel\n\nInput: Whose shoe is that?

Choice B: \"it didn't hear\", is incorrect because it is the negative form of \"he didn\u2019t hear\" and thus the second clause of the sentence \"you didn't tell him about it\" doesn't make sense. Choice C: \"you\" is incorrect because it is a person and not a noun, and the sentence is requesting a choice that is a noun. Choice D: \"I don't think I am supposed to tell you this\" is incorrect because it uses an incorrect present conditional, I don't think/should, \"supposed to\".

Some of the choices such as fetching people and hunting small mammals may need some training to be performed.\n- 4. We pick A because it is the most frequently used use of dogs. \nRationales - 5.

B: the reintroduction of a single animal breed 3. C: the extinction of many species 4. D: the need to preserve animals\nRationales: We can tell that this question is asking about what the phrase 'conservation efforts tells us' is happening. The phrase 'conservation effort' is referring to the efforts made to protect and preserve certain species from becoming extinct - the very fact that the term 'conservation' is used in a sentence would indicate that this is happening. Option A: lack of new species forming, is an unlikely thing to be happening as a result of conservation efforts as the phrase clearly mentions that they are trying to preserve species. So this can be eliminated. Option B: the reintroducing of a single animal breeds is unlikely to be resulting in the conservation of species; rather it's referring to the reintroduction of one species for the sake of one species. So it can be eliminated.  Option C: the extinction or disappearance into obscurity of many species is not necessarily a result of conservation efforts but rather a result of their absence and as a result, it is unlikely that the conservation efforts that are being made to keep certain species from extinction are the sole result of their disappearance. So this cannot be the answer. Option D: the need to protect animals means that they should, in theory, be saved from extinction. So this can be kept only as an option. This is a correct answer.

Hands would be used to move and not climb, as climbing would be achieved more naturally for a marmot than through use of their hands, so they do not use the phrase 'to get to the top' in this context.\n3. To climb to a high place, marmots could use a variety of things, including: outside, jungle, rocks, wood, or trees.\n4. This allows us to eliminate options: outside, jungles, wood, and trees.\n5. Then, if one thing was used in the mountains, it would most likely be rocks since they are a natural feature, although one might climb using other means including trees.

She just can't do what? Choices: A: work B: solve C: get a job D: add E: count\nRationales: We'll begin by eliminating the answer choices that do not make sense here. \nThe term \"Mathematics\" refers to the entire study associated with numbers, shapes, and formulas. We can't solve a mathematic problem if we don't know what it is, i.e. we can't solve \"the mystery\" without knowing it exists. \nSimilarly, the term \"A job\" refers to an occupation that generally requires skill and training. It would be very odd to ask \"how can you do what?\" if the person lacks all of the credentials of the career they are inquiring about.\n\"Getting a job\" is also similar to the \"A job\" choice, in that it's often tied to a profession. You can't apply for a job without first understanding what it is, which in this case is \"mathematics.\"\nSimilarly, you cannot \"get a job\" if you don't know what the job is and it does not use the word \"mathematics.\" You won't be applying for \"mathemantics\" anywhere", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}

It is unlikely that dry books would be kept in a drawer or a bookcase because there might be many other books and it is easy to accidentally damage a dry book that was not intended to be displayed at a certain time.\n3.

The option, D: Library, includes books that are drying and in this situation, we should not assume that a library includes non-fiction books, only fiction books and other materials.\n5. A basement usually refers to a storage space in a house. In homes, books that are not frequently read are typically stored in this type of room and there is a possibility that those books are placed in a large box or some other container.\n6 In addition, there could be areas of the basement with dry conditions and if it is a relatively well-lit area, it could be a good place to keep old books.\n7.

Choices: A: liked her more B: been more respectful C: been very kind D: been more supportive E: been close to her\nRationales: We know the lady, as she is in front of us. We also know that we will probably never meet her again, so even if we liked her more it wouldn't matter.\nHence, among the options we must choose one option that implies the action is \"completed\" (since it is something we already know about/regard for the lady).\nThe best option to complete the sentence is B: \"been more respectful\" because we know that she was already very respectful, so \"more respectful\" is more than we already know.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: You can use a faucet to wash what?

Choices: 1: A: home 2: B: workplace 3: C: school 4: D: outdoors\nRationales: In these kinds of questions, the answer choices will generally point to places where something can be worn, which, in this case, is a jacket. \n1. Home is a building that is usually heated. Thus, it would most likely be inside where wearing a jacket would be preferred. \n2. Workplace is an area where people work. Since the question is asking where we would be wearing a jacket, it makes sense that the answer would be a place where we wear clothes and jackets can be worn. \n3. School is an area where people learn, and not necessarily something that we would want to wear a jacket in. \n4. As for the last answer choice, it would depend on the weather. In colder areas, we could wear a jacket outdoors; in warmer regions, a jacket is probably not that suitable for wearing outdoors. But, since this is a MC question, and not a CA question, we can assume that anywhere would be the place to wear a jacket. 5.

This leaves us with four possible locations for the answer: hill, rocky hillside, hand, and place.\n5. Rocky hillside is likely to be too steep and a marmot cannot get to that top and so cannot be found there.\n6. Hands may be more of a reference to their paws, and we don't necessarily want to know where they would keep hands - we want to know where they can use them.\n7.

{"text": "mentions that the marmots tend to have \"hand\" so they can get to the top. \n3. This means we must identify the top. The sentence talks about 'top' as well as 'hand', so the place that has the 'hand' is likely to be where marmots can \"get to the top\". This can only be something natural, such as a tree or a rocky hillside. \n4. However, we need to check that it is possible for a marmot to reach a location with a hand. In the case of \"jungle\", a marmot is able to see a tree from the ground, grab the branch and, after some effort, climb it. Thus, the correct answer is E: tree.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: What should you see in a tree if the sky is blue? Choices: 1. A: Red birds 2. B: Red flowers\nC: The whole top 3. D: Yellow leaves E: Yellow orangutans\nRationales: Consider the sentence and the options. If the sky is blue, it means that it should be dark, and thus, if we look up at a tree, it is unlikely we will be able to see red flowers, trees, or birds. However, we can potentially see the top, or orangutans. The correct answer is therefore, number 3: the entire top of the tree can be seen if the sky is blue.\n\nInput: What does a robin say?

What should you do? Choices:  a: turn the tap the correct way around b: close it drain the water c: stop using it until repaired d: shut off the water e: flush it\nRationales: First let's analyze where the water comes from. The water comes from the bottom of the tap. This means the water would come from the opposite side. This means the answer should be the option that mentions turning the tap the other way. Then let's go for every answer that's opposite to the direction mentioned in the answer. As, the water comes from the bottom and we should turn the tap the opposite way, we can rule out options B, E, and D. Options A and C don't make sense either.

{"text": "states that marmots can use their hands to climb to the top of what.\n3. The options given are: a) outside, b)hill, c) jungle, d) rocky hillside, and e) tree.\n4. Option e) \"tree\" does not make sense because marmots can't climb trees, and thus, is not a fit for this question.\n5. Option d) \"rocky hillside\" also does not make sense, because marmots are burrowing mammals and wouldn't have hands to use.\n6. The last three options are therefore: a) outside, where marmots can go, b) hill, and c) jungle.\n7. We can cross \"hill\", as it is also where marmots can easily go, and we are told to get to the top.\n8. Finally, among the three remaining options, we need to eliminate \"outside\", because \"outside\" here does not mean the environment outside, but more refers to something outsides marmots, like the sky.\n9. The remaining option is c) \"jungle\", because a jungle is likely to have lots of rocks (also with lots of \"hill\" on them) and it makes sense for a marmot to move to them, but this is still not what it means to climb up to the top.\n10. The correct answer is, therefore, 'jungle', because it is the only place given that meets the sentence requirement.\n11. To understand the rationale for the answer, we can simply understand that we cannot pick a place where marmots aren't to climb to the 'top', meaning an outside area, and a place we simply cannot see any 'rocky' terrain on, which means a burrow or something.\n12.

{"text": "asks about whether they have hands that they can \"use to get to the top\". \n3. This indicates that it takes hands to climb such high places. \n4. So based on our understanding, let's go with our 5 senses.\n5. According to a dictionary, hands are part of our 'arms', and if anything, marmots would more likely 'use their feet' than 'use their hands' to reach those areas.\n6. Based on this reason, we can eliminate choices A: 'outside' and E: 'tree'.\n7. 'Hill' is not a high place unless we're talking about mountain ranges.  Based on the word's definition in a dictionary, a hill is smaller than a mountain. \n8. 'Jungle' is also not a high place. \n9. So now, we're left with two options - B and C.\n10. Out of these two, D: rocky hill side is more specific as it denotes an area of rocks where we can find a hill-like form. \n11.

The birds have their own habitats. \n2. We can use the information from the last statement. The birds would'stay' in the'sky' if the fire didn't burn the trees down (or if it was not present at all). \n3. This is the most unlikely option we've got as birds are very unlikely to be found in the sky in large quantities (there are some exceptions to the rule such as hummingbirds, but the probability of spotting many birds in the sky is minimal). \n4. We discard option 'in trees'. \n5. Thus, the answer will be 'in the sky'.\nAnswer: A: in the sky\n\nInput: A panda eats what? Choices: bananas", "answer": "B: see light"}

Similarly, choice C, jungle, is a natural environment for marmots, so also can be eliminated. \n6. The only remaining answer options are D, rocky hillside, and E, tree.\n7. Rocky hillside is more likely the most appropriate answer choice as it implies a specific height level, making it easier to guess the answer.\n8. Thus, the correct answer for this question is D, rocky hill.\nAnswer: D, rocky hill\n\nInput: What do you call the person, that is also known as a wizard? Choices: 1: A: Mage B: Wizard C: Magic D: Sorcerer E: Alchemist\nRationales: For this question, it talks about that we are going to call someone who is also known as a 'Wizard' a \"Wizard\" as well. \nTherefore, that means we can use any answer in this list.\n1. We start by ruling of choice 1: A: \"Magic\". Magic is not a synonym for wizard.\n2. Then, we can throw away choice 2: \"Wizard\". A wizard is what is being called.\n3.

Choices: D: find your home  D: meet new people    C: have a meal together A: chat with a companion  B: have a photo session A: visit a park  C: go to a museum B: explore a city  E: get a recommendation\nRationales: This question asks for a word or phrases that describes what the new app allows its users to do. \n1. The answer, therefore, must either be a noun or an adjective, since the word 'app' does not provide any relevant meaning.\n2. Let us go through the answer choices:\n3. Option A: 'visit a park' is not an action that people often do together;\n4. Option B: 'explore a city' allows us to interact directly with other people in the city;\n5. Option C:'meet new people' indicates that people meet other people in order to connect or communicate with them;\n6. Option D: 'chat with a companion' is a way of meeting people by conversing through voice or text through an app or device;\n7. Option E: 'get a recommendation' is a verb phrase that people use to suggest a particular place to visit or a specific food to purchase/order; this is a valid option.\n8. Considering all that information, the answer choice A: 'chat with a friend' is the right answer since this noun phrase describes the process of meeting new people.", "answer": "C: london"}

{"text": "asks us what this animal can be found reaching or climbing using its hands. \n3. In looking at the choices, we can eliminate choices B, C and E because there is no evidence to support that they live in or near trees, in jungles or have hands that help them get to the top of rocks.\n4. Option D, rocky hillside, is the best match in that it describes a \"high place,\" which is typically a rocky hillside. It also includes a reference to the marmot's \"hands\" by describing their front paws that are able to \"grab and scramble.\" This implies that they use their fore-limbs to clamber up rocky slopes and hilltops. Also, we can conclude that \"rocky hillside\" is the best choice because this is a high place and \"rock\" can generally be found on a hill.\n5. Answer choice A, outside, is also plausible if we take the phrasing \"high places\" in context. They might be able to leave their hillside homes to traverse other environments, so this is a possible answer as well, but we can also choose to eliminate it as our best answer because the phrasing does not fully align with the rest of the question.\n6. Considering the context of the sentence and all of the answer choices, we can say that the answer is most likely a rocky hillside, but we still have to justify our choice, which is to choose  D.

Thus we have to infer that there is a vast amount of books and they have to be ordered or they have been ordered and have accumulated. \n3. We can use the verb 'to obtain' or the verb 'to acquire'. Acquire has the meaning that we have to take something to ourselves. \n4. So 'to obtain' seems to be appropriate. Thus, the answer should be D: obtain; not A: find, B: borrow, or E: get.\n5.

{"text": "says they have hands that they can \"use \" to get to the top.\n3. This implies a structure like a building or terrain with some kind of rock or dirt.\n4. Trees do not have a surface that could potentially offer a structure for marmots to use to get to the tops of the trees.\n5. There could be hill-like surfaces but they are generally not as rocky as a rocky hillside.\n6. Buildings with handrails typically don't have rocky surfaces to support marmot's handholds and, if they do, would not be high enough to provide a suitable place for marmots.\n7. Hill and jungle provide an appropriate surface in which marmots can find handholds that get them to the top and, therefore, are suitable choices.\n8.

{"text": "goes on to say marmots can get to the top of something.\n3. Since the marmots use their hands to climb to the top, \"hands\" provides the clue for the remaining four choices: A: outside, B: hill, C: jungle, and D: rocky hill side.\n4. \"outside\" does not make sense, as it is not clear what marmots are climbing out of, or where to.\n5. In a hill, you have a higher point and a lower point, however, \"high places\" do not necessarily have to be higher than the ground. Marmots can climb a hill, but they do not need to climb a hill, which makes B the best choice.\n6. The jungle is a place where many things live, including the marmots. So that is a potential place they could climb, but it is not necessary, which makes C a possible choice.\n7. A rocky hillside is a specific type of hill that would be much more prone to marmots climbing up. It's not a generic piece of rock that could contain any animal; it needs to be a specific kind of hill. \"Rocky hillside\" works perfectly as the answer choice.\n8. Thus, the answer to the question is that marmots can climb up a rocky hillside.\nAnswer: D, rocky hillside\n\nInput: The cat tried to eat mouse. The cat could not get mouse. What did the cat try to do instead of eating mouse? Choices:  B: walk around\nRationales: We can tell from the question that the cat tried to eat the mouse, but was unable to. And we know from the word \"try\" that you can't assume that they were successful with their task.\nSo the cat can still try to eat mouse again, or try to do something else.\n\n1. The cat was trying to eat the mouse, so it's unlikely that \"crawl\" would have been the right phrase after \"try\". \n2. The word \"walk\" makes very clear that the cat was trying to eat mouse. It can still be wandering around without eating the mouse, as we know from the word try. This makes \"walk around\" an incorrect choice.\n3. The word \"hunt\" is a possible choice", "answer": "B: passing grade"}
{"text": "states that they can use their hands to reach the top of something.\n3. Out of the given choices, tree and hill are the places which marmots can be found, but as \"hands they can use\" are mentioned, the answer can only be a small narrow hilltop, rocky hilltop, etc.\n4. Since the answer choices are all small places, \"Rocky hillside\" is the most appropriate answer as it not only fits the context but also is the most specific.\nAnswer: C, Rocky hillside\n\nInput: The lagoon shines, it's water is clear and refined, this is because of what? Choices A: mud B: water C: salt D: fresh E: sediment\nRationales:\n1. The lagoon shine because of the reasons we're given in the sentence.\n2. The lagoon is clear and refined because the water contains clear fresh water.\n3. It is fresh because the answer option C, 'fresh', fits the sentence.\nAnswer: C fresh\n\nInput: In which environment can a beech tree best be found? Choices A: desert B: garden C: jungle  D: field E: forest\nRationales: Since the question asks in which of the environments a beech tree can be found best, Beech tree will most probably be found in forest out of all the environments we are provided.\nAnswer: D field\n\nInput: The bird of paradise, known by its incredible colourful feathers is endemic to which of these locations?

{"text": "mentions that marmots have hands that they can hold onto. \n3. As there is only one answer choice here that could fit the description, it can be concluded that hand is the correct word to use in the answer.\n4. Choices B, C and E do not require any hands, as they are all places where it would be more suitable to crawl or climb a tree than to use hands. \n5. Choice D is a rocky hillside, and it would take a lot of climbing to get to the top here. \n6. As the question clearly states that marmots have \"hands\", we can conclude that the answer will be \"hands\", and the word is correct.\nAnswer: Hands\n\nInput: The man is very clever. Where is the place? Choices:  B: backyard A: brain C: front yard D: mind E: lawn\nRationales: This question is asking about the \"place\" and not the person. Since the word \"place\" does not refer to the individual, the pronoun \"which\" should be used here and should not start with a capital letter. \nThe question implies that the place is \"clever\", so choice \"B\" should be eliminated as \"backyard\" is used primarily to refer to a person. \nThe most appropriate answer would be \"D (mind)\" because the question refers to the location of the clever place and not of the clever person. Choices \"A\", \"C\", and \"E\" are not applicable here as they do not imply location. Further, \"front yard\" and \"lawn\" are also not appropriate as the question talks about the location of the clever thing rather than the place being clever. \nTherefore, the correct answer is \"mind\".\nAnswer: D (mind)\n\nInput: What are you usually eating at lunch?

{"text": "says that marmots have hands that can be used to get to the top. The word being searched is 'use', which is a transitive verb.\n3. Marmots cannot use their hands to get to the top on their own - they need the top of what to get to. The choice need not necessarily be a place. \n4. When narrowing down what the marmots 'use' the top of, we see that the answer choices are 'hill', 'jungle', 'rocky hillside', 'tree'.\n5. The question specifically mentions that marmots are found at high places, so it is unlikely that 'hill' is the answer. This option is eliminated. \n6. Marmots can be found in jungles. However, a jungle has tree canopies and marmots typically do not climb high to reach a tree. So the answer is \"E: tree\".\nAnswer: E: tree\n\nInput: She was an avid learner in college, and her college was a beautiful large what? Choices:A: building B: campus C: campus city D: university E: university campus\nRationales:1.The given statements: \"She was an avid lear\" is the correct grammatical usage of she. 2. She was \"avid learner\" is incorrect. 3. The next sentence states that her college \"was a beautiful large university campus\". 4.

Option C talks about \"Jungle\" not \"some top\" and so it's eliminates.\n6. We can eliminate option B, which is talking about \"Hill\" again, and has nothing about \"some top\"\n7. The rest of the answer choices talk about place. So our answer would be place, either rocky hill side or the tree, where marmots can be found. \n8.

We are looking for something that marmots can use to reach places higher than them.\n5. \"Outside\" is an invalid answer. This would indicate that the item that marmots access to climb higher surfaces belongs in the outdoors, but marmots live in the high places.\n6. \"Hill\" means a land elevation rising higher than the land around it. But we don't need to know how the hand is used to climb \"a hill\".\n7. \"Jungle\" is similar to \"outside\" in the sense that although they might have a \"hill\" there, they wouldn't be referred to as a \"hill\" unless it had features that were \"higher than the land around them\". There are different types of \"higher places\", but all \"hills\" aren't necessarily the same.\n8. \"Rocky hillside\" is closer to the intended answer because it fits the description, but it is not specific enough. The \"rocky hillside\" might only be part of a \"hill\" and could refer to a \"jungle\" part of the \"high place\".\n9. \"Trees\" is an invalid answer, because although they are indeed high up and marmots can climb them, they provide no other benefit to climbing marmots.\n10.

There is a possible logical flaw in this answer, in which if a rocky hillside does not exist, a marmot can still be found on a hillside, as it will go to a different hill-area it can get to.\n7. Thus, we keep all the options except D: hill.\n8. Now we look at the answer options from top to down.\n9. In a very broad sense, C: jungle is the only place that you can be in where marmots might be found on top of something - because in jungle, marmots use trees to get to the top.\n10.

Therefore, this is not true and can be inferred as false. It suggests that even if boats are the same size, they will not lose a race.\nOption B: If winds change then a boat might take a different route based on the winds. So if they are favorable, the boat might move quickly and in doing so, take the lead on the opposing boat. Therefore, this would be an acceptable answer.\nOption C: In a straight line - If boats are racing and their races are directly parallel to each other (straight line) and the boat in front loses some control or power (losing race), then the chances of competitor overtaking are high. Therefore, this could be inferred as true. But if the boat in front keeps on his/her stride then it will not lose the race.\nOption D: If you have a small boat you can race with a bigger boat without fear of losing the race. Therefore, this can be understood as an incorrect answer which doesn't make any sense.\nOption E: Generally in a race where two boats are racing, the one that is on the wrong side will lose the race.

{"text": "talks about the type of structures that these creatures can be found in, and it says that they can use their hands to get to the top.\n3. To do this, they need a structure on which they can stand. So to solve the question, we have to find the part of their surroundings marmots can stand on.\n4. To figure it out, we start with the answer choices, eliminating options B: hill, C: jungle, and E: tree since marmots are small animals and they are not likely to stay in these large structures.\n5. The sentence continues by stating that the marmots usually stay on a \"rocky hillside\". But when we say \"rocky hillside\" with the right use of prepositions, we would need \"rocky hillsides\", making the statement ungrammatical.\n6. That brings us to the remaining options - A: Outside and D: rocky hill. When we analyze our choices, we see that option A: \"outside\" seems far away from the hillside.\n7. So the most logical answer choice would be D: Rocky hill.\n8. This is the point where the question is trying to get us to think about marmot hands by asking: \"They have hands that they can USE to get to the top [of the rocky hill.]\"?\n9. This implies that the marmots could use their hands only on the rocky hill.\n10. So the answer choice is D: rocky hill where animals can use their hands.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "indicates that marmots possess the ability to use their hands to reach the top of whatever it is that they want to climb.\n3. Since the question clearly indicates that marmots can climb, we can rule out choice A: outside, which does not provide a surface to climb on.\n4. Choices B and C, hill and jungle, could both potentially be climbable by marmots, but if they can only use their hands to get to the top, they may not be able to get to certain higher areas using that.\n5. Choice D, rocky hillside, could potentially be appropriate for a marmot as it allows for marmots being able to use their hands to climb.\n6. However, from context, we can say that the 'the top' of this rocky hillside is not the highest spot possible, which leaves choice E - tree, the highest possible choice.\n7. We choose answer choice E.\nAnswer: E tree\n\nInput: I hope to get the job, I will definitely not give up. I will keep working until I get the job. I am not going to quit. Choices:  A. \"I will be patient.\" B. \"I will practice.\" C. \"I will continue.\" D. \"I will not stop trying.\" E. \"I will stop complaining.\"\nRationales: We understand from the question that choosing a suitable answer will mean saying something other than giving up. We will thus look for choices that tell us that giving up is not an option.\n8. A: I will be patient.\n9. Option A shows that the test taker will try and wait, but there will still be some expectation of the outcome. \n10. B: I will practice.\n11. 'Practice' sounds like a more specific activity, and in this case it is something that the test taker may do after he or she is not longer expecting an outcome such as the given job.\n12. C: Keep working. The test taker needs to make a choice after giving up, and this is something that might lead to a more positive outcome.\n13. D: I will not. The test taker will not.

Choices: 1: africa 2: south america 3: the americas 4: asia 5: australia\nRationales: Africa has gorillas, not chimps.\nSouth America has monkeys, not chimps. South America also includes Antarctica, which has no chimps. South America, Australia, and Asia has the orangutan, not chimps. \n1. The sentence refers to a particular variety of ape known as a chimp and where it lives.\n2. The answer might pertain to a certain chimp, or the type of chimp.\n3. We eliminate options 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 as they relate to particular ape species. \n4. To narrow the answer from our elimination, the answer must start with a particular type of chimp and end in another country.\n5. Therefore, from options 4 and 5, the chimp would need to end in Australia since that is the only country where it was not specified.\n6. Option 4 also ends with \"Australia\" in its answer.\n7. Thus 4, Australia, is the answer.\nAnswer: 4. Australia\n\nInput: How can you tell that chewing gum has not been thoroughly chewed by someone?

However, books are usually written by a different person than the one who edits them. While editing may be required, it is not a sufficient requirement to make a book.\n2.

Also, publishing needs a lot of money and a lot of time, and to know to whom we shall publish the book is also not implied in the question. Moreover, publishers are not allowed to correct the texts, and they are also not the authors. Therefore, publish is not a necessary thing to make a book.

Tokyo in Japan\nRationales: This is one of the tricky questions that can be answered without writing full sentences.\nConsider the clues carefully. The city was built to see the sea and at night, it looks best at the edge of that sea.\n\"It\" is a noun, so it would be something that the word 'looks' is describing. In this question, 'it' is the city.\nSo the next step is to identify what city was built to look over the sea and looks best from an edge.\nTo answer the previous questions, consider these clues: at night, the city (Sydney) looks best (beautiful, gorgeous) at the edge (shore).\nTherefore, answer is Option A: Sydney.\nAnswer: A. Sydney\n\nInput: The answer is Easy Peasy!\nRationales: In all kinds of English, the expression \"the answer is [easy and/or] peasy\" is a simple way of saying that something", "answer": "C: michigan"}

Choices: 1. spider silk 2. sheet 3. sheet cotton 4. rubber 5. wool\n\nRationales:\n1. The material that people often use to make ghost costume is spider silk because it is a fine material and can be easily stretched to fit their ghost's form.\n2. A sheet is rarely used in the context of making a ghost costume because it is too thick and is difficult to be stretched to fit the ghost's form, also the ghost will be able to move freely with a sheet, which contradicts the ghost characteristic of staying still and being invisible.\n3. A sheet with cotton and can be used to make a costume for a ghost, but because of it's thickness, it would be impossible to stretch this material to fit the ghost costume's form.\n4. A rubber suit is rarely used as a costume for ghost. It does not have a clear ghost form. If they wore a rubber suit, they cannot be invisible, which is considered a key attribute for a ghost.\n5. The type of wool that is used is too thick it would be impossible to use wool as the costume for a ghoast because of it's ability to trap in heat. The ghosts are usually depicted as cold in appearance.\nThe correct answer is a spider's silk is \nAnswer: Spider silk\n\n---\n\n### Bonus task:\n\nInput: What do you usually eat with a pie?

They are always looking forward to their next trip.  What? Choices:  Tip: A: exam B: bathroom C: food D: bedtime E: treatment\nRationales: They have a fun time at veterinarian.  This sentence implies that veterinarian is not a normal part of the cats' life. \nSo there should be something more entertaining compared to other places that the cats go to.\nIn the question, we are looking for what those cats enjoy most at the veterinarians.  The first option A: exam, is not what the cats enjoy at the veterinariant.\nBedtime is not an accurate answer. There might be a few cats that enjoy going to the vet. However, it does not apply to all cats in this sentence. \nSo what do the cats usually enjoy at the veterinarian?  Cats like to be fed and treated.

Choices A, B, E suggest fact and so it is incorrect to say that we 'know' any false facts with firsthand experience. Choice D suggests 'it' refers to an event but it does not mean that. This is because it can't be said that a 'thing' was untrue based on our knowledge about an event. This brings us to the choice of having to go with a choice where 'it' refers to a fact or a sentence which we believe to be true.

These two words show a parallel structure and show a connection to \"what\". \nThe second part of the sentence tells us that the engine powers \"what\".

(d) rocky hillsides are generally found in rocky terrain, not hills, so (d) is also an out-of-place answer choice.\n9.

Although all mammals generally have hands, this doesn't fit the information provided in the question, which specifically refers to marmots.\n4. B: a hill. Although hills can be high, in that case, they would not be considered hills anymore. Also, in general, marmots are usually found in mountains, not hilly regions.\n5. C: a jungle. The jungle has a wide array of natural obstacles, all of which marmots would have difficulty overcoming. Additionally, a jungle is not a high place.\n6. D: a rocky hillside. This has similar reasoning to that of a jungle, referring to a low, rocky place, not a high place. Also, even if marmots could use the rocks on the hillside to climb, it would require considerable time and effort because of the abundance of rocks and their irregular shapes. And this could still only get them partway to the top.\n7. E: a tree. While marmots may use a tree as a climbing platform, they would not be able to walk on it like the word \u201chands\u201d suggests.

Option A: 'Sea star'- not a viable option. The sailor is not likely to advise the captain on how to steer the ship. \nOption B: 'Ashark'- this doesn't fit as the sailor would not advise the captain on navigating the sea, and they are unrelated species. \nOption C: 'A sailor' - this is the most likely option, that may mean that the captain could have been given advice by a fellow sailor. \nOption D: 'A storm'- not a viable option, a storm can't advise the captain of the ship. \nThe option that makes the most sense is 'A sailor' and therefore the answer is C: sailor.\n\nAnswer: C: sailor\n\nInput: The car was taken to the garage by the owner.

The verb \"grow\" in \"growing up\" is most probably not being replaced with the word \"ghost\" because \"grow\" is a form of the verb \"grow\" and the adjective \"growing\" is generally used to indicate the action of something or someone growing. \n2. Even if we look at the choice E: Being forgotten, this option doesn't fit the sentence and should be eliminated. \n3. Choice D: Running away is probably a choice because when \"ghosting\" someone, we would be avoiding our problems and running away.\n4. Choices A: Growing old and C) Avoiding responsibility also seem to be possible answers because the word \"old\" and \"responsible\" have similar meanings. They're both describing someone who is no longer young and free, and this is a negative trait. \n5.

Option B: \"a hill\" can be ruled out on account of its inclusion in Option D, \"hillside.\"\n9.

Thus, they sometimes park their cars where they? Choices: \tA: want B: desire C: want to D: don't want E: desire to\nRationales: We analyze the question and understand that it makes sense that when people drive, they don\u2019t always pay attention to the traffic. Further, the question tells us that a result of not paying attention to traffic is that people sometimes park where they want.\nFrom here, we need to figure out what it means when someone doesn\u2019t always pay attention. There are three answer choices that deal with desires: options A: want, C: want to, and E: desire to. We know for a fact that the people parking their cars do not always pay attention and, thus, they usually don\u2019t want to park in the spots they want.\nTherefore, we narrow our choices to whether or not people would like to park in the spices they want. We can rule out option A: don\u2019t want, because people who don\u2019t always pay attentions don\u2019t want to parking their cars in the places they want. To get rid of option E: desire to, note that the question specifically states that people sometimes park where the people don\u2019t always pay ation.

A tree (option E) is a relatively low, non rocky object that would not give a marmot a hard time to climb.

A marmot can't live under the ground as there is no sunlight there. \nThis eliminates B: Hill.\n11. The reason a marmot's paws are useful isn't to stay warm against jungle or forest temperatures. Rather, marmot's paw serves as a \"digging tool\", so they can come out into the daylight and feed. \nTherefore E: Tree can be eliminated as it is not a place where marmots come out to feed.\n12. Looking through the question again, we realize that the statement says, the hands \"they\" have is a plural pronoun suggesting that there is more than one marmot. \nFurthermore, only animals have hands, so we know that the marmot's hands aren't made of rocks or hard dirt.\n13. Therefore, we eliminate B: Hill as we know it refers to the part of the hilltop that a single marmot would have to get to.\n14.

Choices:  A : thirst B: hunger C: because water is nice to look at D: because it is always pretty E: because you can fish with it \nRationales: Forests and oceans are natural habitats of many living organisms. Since fresh water is not readily available in such habitats, people need them in order to survive. If you are thirsty, then you need water. If you are hungry for fish, you need the necessary water to catch the fish. Moreover, the environment outside needs to be kept healthy and safe.

The question does not specify any more details, thus we can leave the noun blank.\n5. We cross out all but two choices: 'hill' and 'rocky hillside'. \n6. The sentence says that marmots are found in high places. Thus, 'hill' is not correct because they cannot be found in low places. \n7. 'Rocky hillside' is a place with rocks on the side, since marmots can use rocks to climb up and down. We can cross out everything else. \n6. Thus, choosing an option between 'hill' and 'Rocky hill' would be the best choice.\n7. We can cross out 'rocky hill' because it is more of a hill where rocks are present, while marmots can only use it as a base to start climbing. \n8. Hence, the answer is A, since a hill is a raised area of land with a flat top.\nAnswer: A, hill\n\nInput: What can we find on a puffer fish? Choices:  B: dorsal fin C: pectoral fin D: eyes E: fins\nRationales: Option B: dorsal means top, so we know that no fish has its dorsal fin on its abdomen.

Option C: \"jungle\" is also a common habitat for marmots and could also not exclusively be the home of marmots. \n6. Option D: \"rocky hillside\" seems appropriate, as mountain goats and pikas also commonly rest on rocky hill sides, but it is not exclusive to them. \n7. Option E: \"tree\" is unique, and since marmots don't use hands, it would be an unlikely answer. Hence, we rule out E.\n8.

All choices are locations other than trees, except B, but it could be the case that marmots have hands, and still use trees to get to the top, so the answer is not given by choice B.\n4. For A, choice E and D, the question does not tell us that the marmots with hands use the tools at all, so all these choices might not be the right answer.\n5. Choice \"C: jungle\" does not fit the question right because marmots are not generally described as looking for jungles in high places.\n6. Since all other choices are not specific places, one could conclude that the right answer is C: jungle only because of no other choices to consider.\n7. However, while the answer could be jungle, the question says that all marmots have hands and marmots in jungles might not have hands, which changes this answer to be not the right choice since the answer choice is not specific about how the marmots use their hands.\n8.

Choices:  C: bread B: knives A: toasts D: slicers E: cookies\nRationales: We can infer 'toaster' is a plural form of the common term 'toaster' and is commonly known to be a device for toasting bread. (bread burns, while toasters do not burn). \n2. The sentence then tells that if a toaster were made with steel, it would probably not burn out. \n3. Since steel cannot be burned, this implies that anything that cannot be made with steel must be burnable; that is to say, anything that can be burned must not be made of steel.\n4. With this in mind, eliminating A, C, and E is a quick process. B and D require no explanation at all, and E is not commonly known to be burnable; thus, they are the right answers.\n5. B: Knives are commonly made of steel, and this is a well-known fact that can be proved by performing an internet search. \n6.

Choices:  is a lie - incorrect; is a person without trust - incorrect; is a reliable person - incorrect; is truthful - correct, as an outlier is a person who lives in an area outside a group of people or society - correct.\nRationales: 'An untrustworthy' indicates that a person 'is not to be trusted'. \nNext, we are given a term, 'an outlier', which doesn't match the part in the sentence prior to it (because it doesn't describe an untrustworthy.

In order to answer this question, it is necessary to determine what the sentence means and use the answer options to rule out what is not intended.\n5. It is important to note that 'hill' refers to a smaller height than 'rocky hillside' so 'rocky hillside is ruled out to begin with.\n6. We can eliminate 'outside' since marmots can only get to outside spaces if they are in a human-made structure. Marmots do not live in human-made structures.\n\n7. 'Jungles' are places which are dense with trees so 'Tree' rules out.\n8. So, the remaining options are 'hill' and 'rocky hillside'.\n9. Considering it is a high place, one can conclude that 'hill' is not suitable as it doesn't indicate that there are any high places around.\n10. 'Rocky hillside' refers to a slope which is not suitable for the marmot to climb because it would require physical effort, while the marmot does not need to do so to be in a high place.\n11.

The next sentence implies that the group is going to a place they have identified in response to their planning.\n12. The statement, 'the mountain' does not indicate \"the group is going to where\" a particular mountain has been planned for but rather indicates where they have been planning to go, which would be to a mountain.\n13. On the same note, the phrase, 'the hills' does not suggest that the group is going 'to' a particular place. It indicates that they have been planning to 'go to' a place.\n14.

However, the question gives no reason as to why marmots' hands need to climb. It can just happen to climb. \n5. Therefore, we need to find an answer choice that doesn't require their hands to climb.\n6. When we look at our options - tree, rocky hillside, jungle, and outside - it's clear that none of them require marmots' hands to climb. Rather, they can be found in those places. \n7. In rocky hillside, the marmots' hands might be used to climb, but we can also use marmots' hands out of their hands, let's say, \"they use their hands to push the rocks and move them around so they can climb easily\". \n8. With rocky hillside, we also don't see any reason that they need to climb. They can just roam freely in that place.\n9. Similarly, in the jungle, marmots can also use their hands to climb up trees and find food in the jungles. However, they can just also walk around and find food along with other animals without climbing up any tree. \n10. Likewise, in the outside world, marmots can use their hands to climbing up a tree. But, they can also roam freely without any restrictions. \n11.

He used a paintbrush as one of the tools of his trade. What other tools did he have available to give his painting? Choices:  B: paintbrush C: pencil D: canvas E: easel\nRationales: In any artwork, we can assume that an artist uses various tools to draw or paint pictures. From this, the question is able to extract the information that the artist used a specific tool - a paintbrush - to perform his job.\n6. From the provided context - that the artist used the brush as one of the necessary tools to create the painting - it is very likely that he would use additional tools to ensure that the drawing would have a good quality.\n6. This is because he is interested in improving the painting and making it more \"life-like\".\n7. Using these facts, it is fair to conclude that the question is trying to find out which other tools was used by the artist (not mentioning the paintbrush).\n8. If we use our deductive reasoning skills, we can determine that the other tools that were used were not mentioned in the statement directly.\n9. Thus, it is safe to conclude that any tools that were not mentioned in the context will be found in the 'Answer Options' provided.\n10.

The first part says that people favour cats over dogs.\n2. The second asks us to complete the question with 'cat' and explain why cats are better than dogs. \n3. The cat is the one that is being described and it can be a domestic animal, wild animal, or even a mammal.\n4. In short, only the two answers: B - 'wild cat' and D - 'pet' fit the description.\n5. Of these two, option D - pet cat, is more fitting as it is the most common term used. Cats as animals are wild, but are commonly kept as pets.\n6.

But, option B simply mentions hands, not 'hands that they can use', which is mentioned in the question. \n5. So, we know that both options A and B cannot be the answer.\n6. But, the question implies that marmots can be found in high spots and \"hands\" are something that they use to get to the spot.

Choices: A: mend the broken window B: mend his backache C: fix something D: his work E: write a letter\nRationales: There are couple of things to note:\n1. He looked across his desks. In general, when we use the term 'desk' it refers to a flat surface for working at, used as a table, \ngenerally in an office, at school, etc. It is also a surface one uses to write at, typically has no drawers or cabinets etc.\n2. He noticed that \"he had forgotten to ______ his desk\". From this information we can further narrow the choices.\n3.

{"text": "asks us about their hands, the reason for which is revealed in the next phrase - so they can get to the top of something, presumably because they don't have a method of getting to the high places where they live.\n3. This implies that the marmots do not have a method of transportation to the high places wherein they live, which rules out the fact they can be carried by ants or washed by bears.\n4. Option C, jungle, is where marmot's can live, but it does not make sense from the context that they cannot reach the high places where they can live.\n5. Option D, rocky hillside, includes the phrase 'what?', which does not make grammatical sense in the context and is excluded from the choice list.\n6. Option E, tree, is also a high place and does not make grammatrical sense. It can be discarded too.\n7. Thus, option A, outside, is likely the location from which the marmot can use its hands to travel to higher places. It is a high place, it makes grammatical sense in this context and is the only option left for consideration.\nAnswer: A Outside\n\nInput: Where should you put a picture which contains an aerial view of the city? On what? Choices: A: desk B: shelf C: table D: wall E: picture frame\nRationales: This question asks us to put a picture on somewhere containing an aerial view of a city. \n1. The first thing to do is to eliminate choices that do not contain surfaces that contain air. \n2. Choices A and E have surfaces entirely on the ground, and are not likely to have a picture with an aerial view of cities displayed on them. \n3. Both choices B and C are surfaces with air on both top and sides, but choice C also has a table surface, while option B has an entirely separate surface which is not at the same level.\n4. This eliminates both options B and C,  as we know the picture is placed on a surface that contains air and has an elevated surface - a desk or table.\n5. Hence, the final answer that remains is D: wall for this picture with the aerial view of a large city.\nAnswer: D Wall\n\nInput: Which animal is less likely to live between the", "answer": "B: hospital"}

{"text": "adds that marmots have hands that can be used to get to the top.\n3. The options are outside, hill, jungle, rockyhillside, and tree.\n4. We can eliminate the options for where these hands might be used. Outside and jungle are out since these places do not refer to tops.\n5. Tree cannot be ruled out directly for being the tops since marmots do not usually use their hands for climbing trees, unless they climb trees often.\n6. Likewise rockyhillside cannot be ruled out since marmots do use their hands to climb rocky hillside in order to locate burrows.\n7. This leaves us with the choices of A and C, which is outside and hill.\n8. The choice that most fits into the context is outside, as a hill is usually a mountain with a rocky top.

{"text": "says that these marmots have hands that they can \"use to get to the top.\" \n3. As none of the options can reasonably provide a platform that a marmot can climb (except for Option D, rocky hillside), it is appropriate to consider that \"high places\" include natural formations like hills, jungles, and trees. \n4. Among the choices, Option D, rocky hillsides, refers to the environment a marmot is found, not a way to get there. \n5. Marmots are adept climbers; they can climb just fine without use of feet, instead relying on their paws, which gives a strong suggestion that Option C, jungles has to be the correct answer. \n6. As Option B outside says the climbing process is happening outside, it cannot be the right answer. Similarly, Option E, trees cannot be the correct answer as it says a way that the marmot uses to move to the top, it implies that there is a top where the marmot is and a way down from it. \n7. Only one option can fulfill all the requirements: the hands that marmots have can be used to get to the top - by simply climbing up, they can reach the summit of any jungle in the world. \n8.

What did it need for these powers? choices:  A: a bird B: feathers C: an engine D: wheels E: fur\nRationales:1. The sentence is describing the bicycle with some unique attributes. 2. These attributes are that the bicycle is fast and strong like an owl or eagle. 3. To make these phrases comparisons make sense, there need to be other qualities.\n4. The sentence gives these choices: a bird, feathers, an engine, wheels, and fur.\n5. For these choices 'a bird' can't be used because it isn't an object and 'a bird' is not a thing that can make a bicycle strong or fast. 'Feathers' does not provide qualities to make bicycle fast, but they are required for making bicycle light in weight. \n6.

Option D: rocky hill is used in the context of \"jungle.\" \"Rocky hill\" is not a specific type of place that marmothands can use.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer must be found in A, B, C.\n8. A: Hill is ruled out as marmots don't have hands, so that leaves a hill with marmothands.\n9. B: Outside is ruled out as marmot's are not found on the outside of anything. That leaves \"in a\" and inside.\n10. Inside an outside is not common, so we will rule it out and leave B - Outside.\n11. C: JUNGLE, marmot's can't get to the top of a jungle, as a jungle is a wooded area, not a climbable material.\n12.

Marmots are burrowing animals that are often found in trees, a low place. So, no tree would fit.\n4. A hill is a high place, but a marmot's hands would be too big to pull its body up the hill and they wouldn't stick, since its feet are adapted to gripping.

So we need to look at both the options:\nSkills/Tactics: The word'skills' is a noun and 'to have skills/tactics' means that we have those things. Therefore, the person is assumed to be having skills.\nThus, \"He felt confident that he could beat the new player, because he has skills.\"\nExperience/Stamina: If the question says 'experience/stamina', it's referring to'skills' and'stamina' together.

For example in A which refers to 'outside'. \n5. In option C and D, marmots can be found in mountainous regions, but we are specifically being asked about places \"high in the air\", where they can be found easily. \n6. Marmots use their hands to climb, they cling to rocks with their claws. They also dig burrows under rocks using their front feet. Therefore E: 'trees' is rejected because they aren't very high in the air and cannot be considered top high places for marmots.\n7. This brings us to the answer choice B: A hill.

Choices: 1: swinging, 2: slowing down, 3: stopping, 4: no swinging at all, 5: not swinging in any way, 6: slowing down, stopping, rest, no swinging\nRationales: We have been asked to identify the type of swing which we can perform if the initial swinging has been stopped for some reason. Since we have not been instructed to identify the type of stop, we will assume that the child fell out of the swing. Hence, we need to find the type of swing which will get affected due to the falling of the child. \n7. Swinging refers to movement in a circular or elliptical path; swing is a noun that is used to refer to a particular type of motion, or a movement from equilibrium to non-equilibrium. So, it is an incorrect answer here.\n8. Slowing down implies a decrease in the speed of the swing over time. This is incorrect since the swing has come to a complete halt. \n9.

The first two choices are both places they can be found, so we can eliminate A and B respectively.\n4. Jungles and jungles are not the same. A jungle can be in a hill or high place, whereas hills and high places are different from jungles. So the answer choice D has been eliminated.\n5. Choice E says that they can use their hands for climbing to the top of trees. While this is true, in the context they have hands that they can also use to get to the rocky hillside. So choice E is also eliminated as it can happen that they use their hands to climab to the rocky hill, which happens to be the same thing that they can use their hand for.\n6.

Option B (hill), while a type of high place, is too broad for the context. While some hills could be very high, most would not be the right height for a marmot to climb.\n5. Option A (outside) is unlikely due to its broadness. It's unlikely that a marmot would use its hands to climb the outside of a building or to climb down a tree.\n6. Option E (tree) is impossible since no tree is considered a place. Trees are usually growing from a place.\n7.

E is out because a tree doesn't have anything that could resemble a \"hand\".\n4.

Option D (rocky hillside) might make sense because marmots like to cling and burrow within rocky places, which could be considered \"hands\".\n7. The only remaining choice is C (jungle).

High places include things like trees, hills, cliffs, outside (when placed on a high place).\n6. Out of these high places, trees are not applicable here because 'hand' is used in the question, which cannot be used to place marmot on a top of tree, so B can be eliminated. \n7.

Additionally, an outside setting is usually not what would contain marmots since they prefer to live in high places like hills and mountains.\n4. Thus, we eliminate options A and B.\n5. A hill does not specify any particular type or location of height. For convenience, we further eliminate option C.\n6 We are then left with options D and E, with Hill being more plausible as it is a type of landmass often considered to be a mountain. \n7.

If there is no reason, then the sentence doesn't answer why.\n3. In options C and D, the sentence is asking why people should stop holding their thoughts.\n4. Since the sentence should already answer why, we know the sentences are already incorrect.\n5. Combining all the reasons, the text is saying that if we have a reason not to hold our thoughts, then we should not do it. Since people shouldn't stop thinking their thoughts, we're supposed not to hold anything back.\n6. Thus A", "answer": "C: plain"}

This is because Taco Bell is a famous restaurant chain, but it is neither Mexican, nor has a restaurant. \nTaco bar or Taco truck are possible options, if the question implied to go to the street and try Taco food outside.\nSo, among the answer choices, only A, B, and D is correct.\nA: for taco bar, there should be a bar and not a bell. \nB: Mexican restaurant describes a restaurant.  \nD: deli can be explained as any delicious and quality food sold in grocery stores, food truck, and deli restaurants.\nAnswer: B, C\n\nInput: Where is a good place to grow pine trees?

Reading books is a common daily habit for all and some may have trouble with few specific types of books. Reading comic books and magazines also require a reading ability of a certain level.

Choices: 1: C: farmhouse 2: B: kitchen 3: A: candy store 4: E: jungle 5: D: woods\nRationals: 1. From the first choice's description is a farmhouse, which we can infer as the farmer's workplace and residence by using adjectives 'big' and 'clean'. But this still leaves room for some inference as farmhouses don't specify that they are the farmer's residence, and can be quite sparse sometimes. Therefore, this doesn't meet the description we're looking for.\n2. The second choice suggests that this would be a kitchen, which we can infer from the description of having 'pots' and'spice shelf'. But what's important to infer is that a kitchen would only be related to one specific meal. So even if this were the proper place to find the food, 'find most of your daily food' wouldn't make sense. It would be 'find all your daily food'. Since there's an assumption that the'most' referred to in question is 'all':, this doesn't fit that description.\n3. The third choice has the word 'candy', which doesn't fit the description. Also, the description mentions 'a food', plural. Candy is not a singular form.\n4.

D: You may be in a situation where something unfamiliar is happening. E: You may be betting at a place where sharks go.\nRationales:  1. In the sentence, the phrase \"playing with a shark\" clearly means \"competing with a skilled player\".\n2.

An adjective is not the most important, so this is incorrect.\n2. An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun, so it cannot be a place.\n3. An adjective is an example of a non-animal, so it cannot be an animal.\n4. There are several types of adjectives, so neither option specifically describes the term to the best of our knowledge.\n5.

Choices: 1: A: arms B: legs C: feet D: shoulders\nRationales: Based on the clues, we can eliminate options D and E since they use the word 'body' to answer the question. \nAlso, we know that our bodies consist of some parts. \nTherefore, the answer is  C- Feet, because the sentence talks about what PART of the body is the most important in physical fitness.\nAnswer: C - Feet\n\nInput: What do the words'stuffy' and'stern' mostly apply to? Choices: \nA: books B: people C: objects D: things E: feelings\nRationales: Here we find the words \"stuffy\" and \"stern\". So we need to figure out what those words mean. \nBy looking at the words in context, we can see that \"stuffy\" most likely means the opposite of \"stern\". \nSo we can guess that \"stern\" means serious. Therefore, choice A: \"books\" is the correct answer option to the question.\nWhenever two words are used together, the relationship between the words can make us figure out the correct answer. Because the words \"stuff\" and \"stern\" are opposite to each other, we can figure out the relation between them based on the words and they are being used in context.\nAnswer: A - Books\n\nInput: What might be considered serious by one person might not be serious to another, where are we most", "answer": "C: building"}

They used that to work out what? Choices: A: a song B: speech C: dance D: performance E: part\nRationales:  1. The sentence talks about a small amount of time given and how it was used to work out something.\n2. The options (A, -B, C, -D, E) suggest that they used the small amount of time assigned to the show to work on a song, dance, speech or a performance.\n3. But - the part- indicates that their performance might have been part of a show which they were working on.\n4. Among these options, dance, part, and speech are parts of a performance.\n5. Also, the sentence implies that part- of a show was worked out during a small period of time allotted.\n6. Hence, the show which they were working - on (hence, a part) was a dance.

By eliminating each choice one by one, we can conclude that answer E, ice cream, describes the unpopular thing correctly: most people don't like ice cream with fries.\nAnswer: E - ice cream\n\nInput: If someone wants to build muscle quickly, which exercise should be used? Choices: 1. A: stretching\n2. B: lifting\n3. C: pushing\n4. D: throwing\n5. E: running\nRationales:\n\n1. This exercise should strengthen muscles. 2. Strengthening muscles should involve lifting. \n3. Lifting implies that the person is lifting some weight, which means pushing and throwing should be not used.\n4. The last question eliminated running because running doesn't strengthen muscles, it is a cardio exercise. \nBy combining all the clues, we can tell that the answer choice should be lifting.\n\nThe most appropriate answer is B.\n\nThe most common answer choice is A; however", "answer": "C: money"}

This is a good choice and fits the description perfectly as rocky side has places that are quite high.\n7. Option E: tree.

The answer choices: outdoor, hill, jungle, rocky hillside, tree.\n4. Outdoor and hill are locations/places while jungle and rocky hillside are types/classes of lands.\n5. The answer is A: outside because the marmots live in the wild as they are not domesticated, thus they stay in outside places.\n6. Also, the phrase \"it can use to get to top\" indicates that this has to do with physical motion, so a human made structure in the outdoors is more likely than places that do not allow such freedom of motion like a jungle or a rocky hillside.\n7.

A: homeless 2. B: poor 3. C: immigrants 4. D: abused 5. E: war veterans\nRationales: Read the sentence. It has to be people! The poet's only point of reference for these people is that these people could've been his father's and that he does not love his own father. \n1. The poem is by Maya Angelou. A)  She is a black woman who grew up poor in the American South. B)  She was raped three times by a father figure (she uses the phrase \u201chis hands on me\u201d) when she was seven. \n2. So the group of people that the poet does not love or feels empathy for is homelessness.\n3. Read the poem. The poet doesn\u2019t really mean the people themselves but rather the feelings associated with them. So the actual homeless population is irrelevant here.\n4. Now look at the answers. \n5.

Out of the remaining choices, we can eliminate ones that are obviously unlikely to give marmots a good handhold.\n4. This includes options outside, jungle, and tree that can be considered.\n5. The question doesn't restrict the answer to a \"rocks\" part, so rocky hillside is also an option.\n6. However, the only real candidate to be selected here is C: \"hill\".\n7. The question talks specifically about \"hands\" of a marmot being used to get to the top, but the question doesn't have any reference to specific marmots being at any particular places, so we can't exclude \"hill\" from our options.\n8. Furthermore, marmots are often found in rocky environments and not always on hills, thus \"rocky hillside\" doesn't necessarily have to be the answer either.\n9. Consider all these factors, the answer to this question is C: hill.\nAnswer: C hill\n\nInput: The man could have a lot to deal with as he was going what place?

Choices I: A friend II: An enemy III: A family member IV: A coworker V: An acquaintance\nRationales: By narrowing down the answer options to: \"the person\", \"photograph\" and \"an acquaintance\", we can conclude that the person is probably an acquaintance, not a friend, because:\n1. It is much more probable to have a photograph of an acquaintance than another close friend. An exception is probably people from their past who are not their close friends.\n2. We can exclude the other answer options: \"a friend\" or \"an enemy\" because they do not match what the sentence says. For example, we can eliminate III: \"A family member\" because we are not looking at a photograph of a family member and not at \"a friend\" because a friend is not an acquaintance.\n3. \"the person\" can be an acquaintance since we are looking at their first name. Therefore, our final answer is: D: An acquaintance.\nAnswer: D. An acquaintance.\n\nInput: Marvin is the owner of what? Choices  A: bookstore B: grocery store C: hardware store D: hardware store E: hardware store\nRationales: From the options, we know that there are 2 \"hardware stores\". Our task is to point out that there is more than one \"hardware store\", not just one.\nWe eliminate option A because a bookstore is quite a different store from the ones we know.\nWe also eliminate option B since it is a grocery store. \nSince \"hardware stores\" appear in the options, the", "answer": "E: eat plants"}
{"text": "asks for places where marmots (which are small animals) can be found, which narrows down to the choices that involve mountains.\n3. Choice A: outside would suggest high places in the open air. However, since the only choices that are high places are A: outside and D: rocky hill. outside cannot be the answer.\n4. Choices C: jungle and E: tree would seem to be the ideal environment if there is a climbing difficulty involved between marmots and rocks.\n5. However, the phrasing of the question \"hands to get to top of...\" implies a manual strength-based climactic technique that requires hands.\n6. Therefore we can eliminate all choices but 3 and 5: A: outside does not allow for a manual climactic technique, therefore it can be eliminated. \n7. C: jungle would also eliminate the climactic hand-manual technique, but allows natural tree growth, which is a natural alternative to climactic technique. This can be eliminated. The remaining choices are D: rocky hill with their hand and E: tree. \n8. D: rocky hill requires climactic hand-manual techniques while E: tree does not. Therefore, D: rocky hill can be eliminated and the only option that can answer the question 'what?' is E: tree.\nThis means that marmots cannot use their hands to get to top of tree because there is no place to go to that is higher than tree and the marmot would have to stop climatting the tree or be above the tree.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: Where can you find something that is worthless to a collector?  Choices:  A; desert B. garbage bin C. museum D. pawn shop  E. junk shop\nRationales:  1. We can infer that anything that a collector values in his collection is not of any use when it is no longer part of his collection.\n2. So the places that collectors do not value are the places where a collector does not collect.\n3. As a collector does not typically collect garbage, a garbage bin or dump is not where something might be found that is worthless to any collector.\n4. Since a museum is a place where things are collected, a collector cannot find something there that is worthless to them.\n5. We can infer", "answer": "B: have sex"}

Out of the answer choices:\n5. There is only one place left with an obstacle, which would be a hill. \n6. The choice of a hill also fits with the answer provided in part 2 as it is a tall, solid piece of land that marmots would have to navigate to get to the top. \n7. However, there are not trees to be found atop hills.\n8. Therefore the best option is C: jungle.\nAnswer: C; jungle\n\n### Explanation: The answer given is 'A: box' and it is absolutely incorrect.  This is just a box and not a device or an apparatus. The question asks to describe the box with an adjective that is related to the complexity of the tool.

The remaining options are to be considered in this light:\n4. Option A, 'outside,\" implies being above the ground.  However, since marmots prefer to be in high places and do not normally leave these, 'outside' is an unlikely place to find them.\n5. Option C, 'jungle,\" implies being above the grass or vegetation. This could potentially be a high place to find marmots though they prefer being on higher rocky areas as mentioned in the second part of the sentence.\n6. Option D, rocky hillside,' implies being above a hill and having some rocks or cliffs around it.\n7. Hence, 'D: rocky hillside' makes sense as the answer.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: You might find some books behind a library desk. If not be sure to ask the person who runs what? Choices: A: study center B: library C: meeting room D: library assistant E: desk\nRationales: One way to read this sentence is to understand that in libraries, there can be books behind the desk of the person in charge of the library. \nIf the answer is not behind the desk, we can either ask the person in charge or ask the librarian working the desk. \nAlso note that 'library desk' might mean that there is a desk in the library, but this can only be verified by asking the person.\nSo if not the books, be sure to ask the librarian who runs the desk.  From there we can narrow down the answer to choice C: Meeting room, as a meeting room and library desk both refer to places one could find a desk. \nAnd the answer remains unchanged even if we exclude library desk, because library desk is ambiguous and we need to verify it by asking the librarian, who would be in the meeting room and will not know what other desk there is that one could find behind a desk.  So the answer is the meeting room. \nAnswer: C: Meeting room\n\nInput: What is important in your daily schedule? Choices: A. Coffee B. Me", "answer": "A: injuries"}

The options A: golden retrievers B: German imports C: Pugs D: Australian cattle dogs are all types of dogs. \n\n2. \"Old dog\" would indicate that we're talking about a single dog, so the options A: golden retrieval D: Australian cattle dog are out, because a group of golden retrievers or Australian cattle dogs don't refer to a single dog.

Rocky hillside can be too rocky for marmots to get to the top using their hands.\n7. Option E is tree. Although a tree may be tall, a marmot cannot exactly reach the top of a tree using its hands.\n8. Thus, only option C is left.  Marmots generally live in mountainous places, with rocky surroundings that require lots of time and energy to explore. Therefore, the 'what' that the marmot's will use their hands to get is actually rocky surroundings.\nAnswer: C:'rocky surroundings'\n\nInput: There are few things that cannot be changed using will.

Rocky hillside and tree have multiple uses other than being a way for Marmots to climb higher.\n6. So, rocky hillside is eliminated as it may not be a proper place for Marmots to be.\n7.

Among the given options, 'A: outside' cannot be answered because outside may or may not be a place that offers high places. Also, outside does not have anything to do with the hands that a marmot might have, making it an incorrect answer choice.\n4. Like outside, 'B: hill' is incorrect since it refers to an elevation rather than having something to do with hands.\n5. 'C: jungle' means a place covered in thick vegetation, such as plants and trees, which doesn't really fit the statement. Also it doesn't have anything to do with hands, which we are looking for.\n6. 'D: rocky hillside' doesn't match the statement either: it does not have anything to offer high places in general, and it does not fit with the description of hands since it does not mention anything about hand-like characteristics.\n7.

Let's analyze outside, hill, junction, and tree.\n6. Inside of the question, we have seen the word 'top', which can be used to specifically refer to a high place. However, outside is a vague location and can be used for many places that contain high places. Therefore, we can eliminate option A: outside.\n7. Option B: hill. A hill is a high, steep part of land. A hill can be located outside, but 'hill' refers to the specific surface. Therefore, option B: outside can be eliminated as well.\n8. Option C: jungle. Many jungles are elevated, some even rising above sea level. So, option C: jungle can be eliminated as many jungles are high places.\n9. Option D: rocky hillsides. A rocky hillside is a high, steeper part of land with rocks on it. It is usually located outside. If so, we eliminate option D: rocks.\n10. Option E: trees. Trees are growing in high places. However, trees are always outside and therefore, option E: trees can be eliminated.  \n11. Therefore, between the options that remain, we eliminate 'outside', 'hill', and 'tree'.\n12.

Therefore, the best option is C: junction.\nAnswer: C junction\n\nInput: Where is your most important belongings stored? Choices:  a) storage b) safe c) chest d) purse e) bank\nRationales: From the question, \"where is your most important belong\" refers to a specific object or things.\n1. First, eliminate \"Storage\" as it indicates a location rather than a thing, making it an unlikely answer for where important belongings can be stored.\n2. Then, eliminate \"Safe\" as in English language, the word \"safe\" typically refers to a place to keep belongings from theft. However, 'theft' does not refer", "answer": "C: control children"}
{"text": "goes on to say that marmots have hands they can use to reach the top of what.\n3. There are 5 answer choices: outside, jungle, tree, hill, rocky hillside.\n4. Outside is not an appropriate answer because marmots can only go somewhere if there is something they could potentially use their hands to do. We can say this because we know that marmots have paws to climb and claws to dig. We also know that they are not meant to swim, so their hands cannot be used for swimming.\n5. Jungle would suggest that marmots are in the South American rainforests, but this is not correct because marmots do not have tails and they do not live in such warm temperatures.\n6. The description of a tree is likely that marmots are using the tops of trees to be on the top of their surroundings.\n7.

Choices:  Rationales: 1) The sentence asks if you should work when on vacation. \n2) We can immediately eliminate option A: The word \"vacation\" can be interchanged with the term \"holiday\" which indicates that our vacation should be a free time. So we can eliminate A.\n3) Option B: \"in\". It's about whether one should work or not. A holiday is not a unit of time so cannot be a good choice for the statement. So, option B can be eliminated. \n4) Option C: \"at\". We can see no other options and there is no unit of time, so we can eliminate this. \n5) Option D: \"on\". It's a holiday, not a unit of time. So no reason to choose this option. \n6) There is only one option left. Answer: E: vacation.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: Where is a good place to go fishing?

So let's look at the meadow's surface.\nOption C: \"in the meadow\". In a meadow, the surface is flat, not rocky. So, we eliminate option C.\nOption D: \"on a boat\". It's also a body of water that implies water, not rocky surface. So, we eliminate it, too.\nOption E: \"in a pond\". The meadow can also be considered a body of water.

{"text": "asks about \"hands\". \n3. Based on the sentence, the question asks us where exactly marmots would use their hands to climb high places. \n4. Marmots use their hands to climbs mountainous rocks and trees. Therefore, the answer choice \"C: jungle\" is incorrect as marmots don't use their hands to reach jungles which typically are flat, low-lying plains.\n5. Answer choice \"D: rocky hillside\" seems correct because there rocky hillsides are indeed good places for marmots to climb with their hands. However, the question also provides an additional clue where marmots need to be able to use their hands, which is above. Thus, it is evident that marmots need to climb to high places, which is what would be described by the answer choice \"E: tree\".\n6. This is because \"tree\"s usually have sturdy, tall branches which marmots can easily reach with their hands, allowing them to get on top of the tree and thus climb to high places.\n7. After thinking of all the factors, the correct answer is \"E: tree\". Answer: E: tree\n\nInput: This man is an expert in bikes. He has what? Choices:   A: a collection of vintage rides B: a large number of bicycles C: no particular interest in this type of transportation D: many trophies for his bicycle skills E: countless different brands of bikes\nRationales: Based on the question, this man is an \"expert in bikes\" and we have to find out what he has.\n\nWe can conclude that the man must have a collection of (bicycle) parts. Thus the only correct answer is A: \"a collection of vintage\" rides\" as that answer suggests that the man has a collection of vintages bikes.\nThe rest of the answer choices are either incorrect for indicating that he doesn't have a collection OR it's not describing what an expert in bikes is supposed to have.

We can eliminate options A and B, they do not make sense because the sentence only talks about marmets, and how they prefer high places which are not outside or on a hill.\n3. Option C: jungle is also an unlikely option because if there is a jungle with marmots, it is more likely that the trees and the foliage are what will hinder their hands.\n4. Similarly, option D: rocky hill-side, also needs to be eliminated because the question was about marmots, not rocky hillsides.\n5. Thus option E is the appropriate answer that indicates where marmots are likely found, which is tree.\nAnswer: E. tree\n\nInput: An engineer is what? Choices: A: professional B: professional C: specialized D: specialized E: certified\nRationales: Since the word \"engineer\" is being used to connote the meaning of a profession, it is the right answer to narrow down the choices to the list of professions.\n1. The word \"professional\" means \"engaged in or concerned with a profession, especially to a degree of general or technical competence.\"\n2. Since we already know it is a professional job, narrowing down the choices, B and D, can be eliminated because they don't make sense.\n3.

Their front paws have five webbed digits each, while their hind paws have four. \n4. We can eliminate choice A: \"outside\".\n5. Similarly, choice C: \"jungle\" can be eliminated. Jungles are home to plants, not high places. \n6. The question specifically refers to the 'what', meaning the place, and not what it is used to get to in general. Hence, choice D cannot be the correct answer.\n7. Thus, we are left with option D: 'rocky hillside'.

The sentence indicates that you will find what is likely to be called a fishhook. Thus, the sentence is likely referring to a fishing device, rather than any other type of hook.\n2. If we assume the sentence refers to a fishing device like a fishing hook, all other options are unreasonable and can be immediately ruled out.\n3. Only choice A suggests fishing as an activity, indicating that the sentence refers to a traditional fishing hook.\n4. Hence, the best answer is \"A: fishing hook\"\nAnswer: A: fishing hook\n\nInput: The carnival was in the city center. It was in what? Choices: A: plaza B: park C: street D: square  E: town square\nRationales: If the carnival was in \"the city center\", we can infer that the carnival was located somewhere within the confines of the city. \"Carnival\" is an adjective. \n\nAnswer: \"C: City Park\"\n\nRationales: A city center may often include a park, but if so, there is likely to be some distinguishing feature of the park that makes it uniquely identifiable.

The choices given for the answer are outside, hill, jungle, rocky hillside, and tree.\n5. Outside indicates an area with lower height than marmots but not necessarily one where marmots would live. Therefore, option A is eliminated.\n6. Hill, jungle, and rocky hillside indicate higher places where marmots may live and are a suitable choice. However, option D is eliminated as it's a tree, even though some trees can be found at higher elevations.\n7. Therefore, the right answer is between B, hill, and C, jungle. However, C can be eliminated because jungles are known to be lower because of rainforests and swamps etc. Therefore, we have between A: outside and D: rocky hill area.\n8. Considering the choice, outside seems more probable as marmots normally live in hills. The word \"rocky\" may imply that there is more rock than soil, making outside a better choice for the habitat.\nAnswer: A choice: outside\n\nInput: An ant was not able to find food, it searched far and wide, trying to find what? Choices: A: a spider B: a queen ant C: other ants D: water E: a housefly\nRationales: In the sentence, the ant wasn't able to find food, so we're trying to find something that the ant searched to find food.\n1. Ant searched far and wide, so it couldn't find a spider (because the spider is smaller than the ant). This is option B and C.\n2. Ant was searching for food, so it should find water, not a housefly.

This is incorrect as while Marmots are mammals, this does not appear to be an animal that will have hands made out of rocks that would make them able to move around rocks.\n6. Option E: [tree].

It wasn't just the environment, what else did she feel? Choices: \nA: warm B: anxious C: scared D: unfamiliar E: safe\nRationales:The woman went outside for the first time. We know that she felt uncomfortable and therefore her senses would've been working overtime - she'd probably smell, hear and feel things. She'd also be a bit scared or anxious. There is no specific choice for 'unfamiliar' or 'anxious', so we cannot eliminate those. Similarly, she could be unfamiliar with the location or simply feel like she is vulnerable or unsafe due to a variety of other aspects. We can eliminate'safe' and 'warm' since these do not make sense in context. She would likely be cool and anxious, and feel that she is not welcome in this foreign environment. The other possible choice, 'anxious', is also incorrect because the woman is anxious, even though she is not familiar with the situation. She'd likely be on edge given that she is in a new place.

All of the predators in the area. 5. Nothing because a giraffe's eyesight is only good for looking downwards.\nRationales: When solving these types of questions, you should always follow the logical inference. First, we can tell from the question itself and the context that it talks about what a giraffe see. Thus we infer that a giraffe can see everything, which rules out all the options except the first one. Next, we should rule out all the options that are irrelevant or doesn't match contextually. A lion is not a giraffe and thus is irrelevant so we have already eliminated 4. \"All the animals they can see\" can be generalized and thus isn't very specific.

However, we don't live today in this time period and even more so if we were to build something, we would more likely get metal and clay from the store or make it ourselves as it is cheaper. This excludes answer choices C and D. \nThe same can be said about paper as we don't cut trees to make paper (paper is now commonly made from recycled paper products)\nTherefore, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A. wood", "answer": "C: soft drink"}

Out of the choices given, both A: outside and B: hill are reasonable places for marmots to be, as marmots are generally found outside and live on hills.\n4. But, A: outside does not allow for the use of hands (which is required for this question) and B: hill does not specify the top. So, B and A should both be eliminated.\n5. C: jungle is not likely to have marmots and is not the top of anything. Hence, it should also be eliminated.\n6.

We know that marmots definitely could go in this object, but it would be unlikely that the author of the question would say so directly without having some sort of twist around it.\n7. Choice D: Rocky hillside could be an appropriate answer but Choice E: Tree does not fit for two reasons: \n8. First, marmots do not tend to travel far from their den so they would not normally be found in trees, especially when they can easily be found in rocky hillside. \n9.

This doesn't make sense as the question is not asking to repair a particular car, but instead it is asking about the action you would take in case you were to acquire one that has very low mileage.\nD: \"upgrade it\".

However, it is unlikely for the marmot to use its hands to climbing up inside a jungle since the hands are not specifically described as suitable or specialized for this purpose.\n5. Option A: outside: It is unlikely for the marmots to be using their hands in an outside environment such as a tree.\n6. Option B: hill: the hands are referred to as a'set', indicating that the marmot has more than one hand, meaning that using different hands simultaneously for climbing up the hill would be possible.\n7. Option C: jungle: the word 'hands' is not specifically mentioned as specialized for the activity 'climbing a jungle', so their use in the jungle is unlikely.\n8. Option D: rocky hill side: the hands on the marmot can be used in climbing up an elevated surface. They can climb the rocks, but we can say that the words 'rocky hillside' indicates more general use in outdoor activities.\n9.

It does this by puffing up its chest, showing off its muscles and mane, and giving a frightening growl.  This display serves as a warning to enemies that the lion is ready to fight. \nThere must be some information regarding a fight in the sentence, which will allow eliminating C, D and E;  they don't have anything about fights.\n1.

{"text": "says that marmots have \"hands\", which is a plural form of 'hand'.\n3. We first need to understand what a marmot is.\n4. A marmot is a type of ground squirrel found in Asia and Europe, known for their burrows and often cuddly appearance.\n5. Next, we need to understand the term 'high places'.\n6. We can tell that the question refers to heights of some sort, not literally 'high'. High in this context is synonymous with elevated.\n7. Therefore, the term 'high places' refers to a location that is on a moderately high elevation. \n8.

The second question in the sentence can be deduced to refer to physical locations in which we could possibly find marmots.\n10. So to figure out where the marmots in this sentence could most likely be found, we should be looking at the answer choices as places where marmots tend to live.\n11. Option A: 'outside' probably does not refer to a location where a person would find marmots. \n12.

Option A, outside, which isn't typically used as a feature of a landscape, is inaccurate.\n6. Option B, hill, may be considered a feature of landscape, but this option is generally in reference to any part of a landscape that rises, and thus might not only be a landscape that is a high and mountainous place.\n7. Option C, jungle, may include hills, but it's not usually considered the highest place of the landscape because it's filled with dense vegetation.\n8. Option D, rocky hillside, is more specific and therefore matches better with the requirements of the question, which specifically mentions marmots and hands that can get there, a very specific physical characteristic of those animals.\n9. Option E, tree, does not describe any aspect of the physical landscape, and thus is wrong according to the requirements on the question.\n10. The only correct answer, then is D: rocky hill sided.\nAnswer: D rocky hillside\n\nInput: If a bookkeeper makes errors in the company's records, what will most likely happen? Choices:  B: resign C: discipline D: suspension E: termination \nRationales: By this point in the question, it's clear that bookkeepers can make errors in the company' s records, a concept that can't be inferred from the prior options.\n1. The remaining three answer choices refer to disciplinary actions, and since bookkeepers can't be forced to resign or fire themselves, these two options don't fit in the question. But, we can eliminate these two and focus on the remaining choice, which is D, suspension.\n2. Suspension refers to a punishment where a bookkeeper is restricted from carrying out his or her duties for a limited period of time.\n\nInput: If someone had to explain everything to a person, wouldn't this mean that they had time to do very little else", "answer": "D: underground"}
{"text": "says they have hands which they can use to get the top of what?\n3. Thus, we need to narrow down the options to answer this question. \n4. Option A - is outside. Marmots cannot use their hands to get to outside places. Thus the answer is eliminated.\n5. Option D - Rocky hillside is a mountain. Marmots cannot be found in mountain ranges. Thus the answer is also eliminated. \n6. Option E - TREE. A tree is a plant, and marmots cannot utilize their hands for climbing plants. Thus, we cannot get the marmots to the tree.  So the answer is B: hill.\nAnswer: B - Hill\n\nInput: This sentence tells me that I will be getting wet at a place that you should not get wet at. Where might we have gotten wet? Choices:  Rationales: 1- the answer is E. The place indicated in the sentence is a swimming pool, where one could get wet. \n\n- The first choice A: 'outside' is not a place where one could potentially get wet. \n- The first choice B: 'park' is not a place one should not get wet in. \n- The second choice C: 'beach' is a place where we can get wet. However, the question asks where we would NOT get wet. The beach is a place, where a number of people would get wet. \n2- the answer is E and not D. The swimming pool is a place we typically get wet in, and the fact that a number of people would potentially get wet indicates that the pool would be a place one should not go to get wet. In the rest of the choices, swimming is not likely a common occurrence. \n\n3- the question asks us where we have been getting wet. There is no option that gives us any indication that we have gotten wet multiple times. The only option is E, as the swimming pool is the place most likely to get wet in, and also the place where we do not typically get clean.\n\n4- the question asks where we have gotten wet. The place indicated is a swimming pool. The other options are not places that one would get wet, except for C (beach) and D (swimming pool). Thus the only answer that fits here is E (swimming pool", "answer": "B: office"}
{"text": "gives us what marmots use to get to the tops of the high places.\n3. We do not immediately know why there are two options - hands and a tree. However, since there is no verb phrase of \"they get to the top of...\" in the question, we need to infer it from the options.\n4. Hands can be used by the marmots to get to some locations such as the top of the hill and the rocky hillside.\n5. A tree can also be a top of a hill, but since the marmots like high places and not trees, they \"get to the top\" only of high places, but not trees.\n6. Thus from the above reasoning, we eliminate options A: outside and E: tree.\n7. Thus we are left with options B: hill and C: jungle\n\n8. We compare the two options: C: jungle, which implies that we should find the marmots in the jungle (not high places since jungle is not a high place); whereas, option B: a hill, we should find marmots in hill which is a high place and thus the correct answer is B: a hill.\nAnswer: B:) HILL\n\nInput: What is happening in the house? A: the window has been broken Choices: A: the window has broken B: the carpet has been washed C: a person has fallen over D: the door has been closed E: the floor has been painted\nRationales: If a window is broken, it is either an accident or a deliberate act. But both circumstances, if true, are unlikely to cause the people in the house to be \"broken\" or \"broken hearted\", as the narrator implies.\n4. So, the sentence means that something is happening in the house, and that thing is something happening to the people in the house.\n5. This rules out B: Carpet has been washed and D: Door has been closed, as neither would be likely to produce any broken feeling among the people in the house, only \"happening\" as per definition.\n6. Since this sentence asks us to choose only one option A: Window has been broken is the only logical option that fits the bill.\nAnswer: A) window has been broken\n\nInput: What can be done if an animal is dying?

Hill could be covered in snow and the hands are helpful, however in some cases these may not be enough for the marmot to reach the top.\n11) Option C: \"Jungle\". Jungle could be covered in snow as well. The snow can be too deep for the marmots to walk through it. The only way to get through the snow in this situation would be having a tree that they could use to climb down to it.\n12) Option D: \"Rocky hillside\" is the only choice that fits the question. In this place, rocks would likely have snow on them. The marmots would need to use their hands to get to the top to get on to the tree on the top of the rocky hillside.\n13) Option E: \"Tree\" as the marmots would need a tree to climb down, in order to reach the location mentioned in the question \"high places\".\nThis is because the only way to climb down in this case is to climb down the tree.\n\nAnswer: D: rocky hilltop\n\nInput: People in northern climates tend to appreciate what?

{"text": "elaborates that they have hands that they can utilize to get to the top.\n3. This clearly shows that they climb to the top using their \u2018hands' and they can only use 'hands' since they can only reach high places.\n4.

Choices:  B: yes A: no E: all A: A B: B\nRationales: \"Are you on board with the idea of playing this game?\", is a common phrase used by a person who is offering to do something or play something with someone else. (The phrases \"Board with the game\" or \"Board with the idea\" have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably). The phrase \"Are you on board\" itself gives a positive connotation, therefore one would only use \"A: yes\" if one was really happy about playing the game.\nIf one was not at all happy about playing the game, one would use \"A: no\" because there will be no point to say that one is on board if one doesn\u2019t like the game.\nHence, the only option that makes sense in this scenario is \"A: no\".\nAnswer: A: no\n\nInput: As a person, we are always going to have what?

{"text": "asks about hands, and refers to the hand of a marmot, indicating that the hand in question is from a marmot.\n3. The marmot then uses its hand to get to the top, which indicates that the hand is used to ascend.\n4. Since marmots are small animals, they would not be able to ascend a large, rocky cliff, which indicates that the marmots will be climbing something with relative smoothness.\n5. Hills are usually fairly smooth, unlike rocky cliff sides which contain jagged rocks. Therefore, a 'hill' is likely, making choice C the best answer choice.\nAnswer: C. hill\n\nInput: I heard that he would take a bite from any apple that he could get. Choices:  A. 3 B. 12 C. 20 D. 5 E. 10\nRationales: Choices from A to E are the multiples of 1. Choices B to D divide the whole by 1. So, we cannot find any other way to divide the whole by the multiple 3 other than to divide the whole by 3. So, only option A gives us the correct answer.\nAnswer: A. 3\n\n### Explanation:\nThe multiple 3 refers to the quantity of a particular entity, the apple, or anything.

Option D \"rocky hillside\" could be a possibility if we think that rocky hillside is just another name for hill. But it makes more sense to consider \"rocky\" as a type of terrain, similar to a \"hill\" or \"plain\". Considering that, \"rocky hillside is not high\".\n6.

'Outside' and 'jungle' are not places that require using hands to reach the top. Therefore, they are eliminated.\n5. So now we are left with hill, rocky hillside, and tree. 'Tree' is ruled out because the climbing of trees is not typically done using marmots' hands.\n6. 'Rocky hillside' is also ruled out because we already know that 'hill' is an option. Thus, of the options that remain, the best answer is 'hill'.\nAnswer: A: hill\n\nInput: I am an outgoing person, I like to go to what? Choices: A: home B: museums C: galleries D: theaters E: park\nRationales : I am an outgoing. This means that he/she enjoys going out of or outside of home. \nThe next sentence says I like to go to museums, galleries etc. Thus, to find a place where one can go, we have to look for a location that is open to the public. \nOnly four places out of the given options are public and are accessible to everyone (parks, museums, theaters, galleries). \nTherefore, among these only 'parks' are public and accessible or outgoing place, so answer is 'park'.\nAnswer: C: park \n\nInput: If the bird is singing, what kind of weather do you predict?

Because we have eliminated each of the other options as a climbable object, choice B can be eliminated. \n6.

{"text": "asks about marmots' hands, implying that we should find a place where marmots are likely to find their hands useful. \n3. While the question does not explicitly state what kind of places high places can be, the use of the adjective \"high\" can potentially be linked to places like:\na. Outside\nb. Hill\nc. Jungle\nd. Rocky hillside\n4. All of these places require marmots to be able to climb to certain places (with or without hands). Thus, choice B: Hill and choice D: Rocky hillside are the most relevant choices from the other options. \n5. However, one of the definitions for hill is \"a natural bank formed on a river by erosion\" (Collins Dictionary). \nThus, if a hill is something formed by erosion, it is likely not to be a rocky hillside, as it would be a hill formed by geology. \nHowever, rocky hillside seems to be a better choice because of the implication that it is rocky and not smooth. This eliminates choice A: Outside. \n6. If the marmot were to be a rock climber, they might be using their hands and the hillside would be outside. However, rocks can be formed elsewhere and not only hillsides. \n7. Finally, jungles are often densely populated with vegetation, making them not conducive for marmots' \"hand use\". Thus, choice E is not valid.\n8.

If the plan is to get all the people to match, then we would need exactly 31 names for our plan, which this does not specify.\n3. D) A holiday. This also does not specify the number of people to be matched up.\n4. Choices B) match and E) reunion do not make sense as the two options suggest. \n5.

Although it's true that some Marmots live in jungles, the question does not specify that we need a jungle, so choice C: jungle can also been eliminated.\n6. The Marmot's hands would be enough for them to climb rocks and hillsides. Hence, the third choice D: rocky hill area also needs to be eliminated.\n7, We then narrow down the choices to E: tree.

So, it's most likely one of the 'less common' planets that we can choose.\n\n1. Choice A: Saturn is one of the lesser common planets. Additionally, it's not even the planet closest to the sun, as choice E: Uranus is closer.\n2. Choice B: Mars is also not the closest planet, nor is it a planet that takes a long time to orbit the sun based on the question.\n3. Choices C & D: Earth & Venus are very popular choices but they're not the right answer, as they're not the planet that spends longer orbiting around the sun than humans could possibly walk around a room.\n4. Combining all this information, the planet that we're looking for is choice E, Uranus, which is the planet that takes longer. This can be verified by comparing the size and distance of the planets from the sun as in Astronomy, a planet orbiting the sun is said to complete one 'orbit' when it completes a full revolution around the sun, which means it takes half of the time to orbit the sun once compared to the planet that is halfway through its orbit.

Choices: A: rain gull B: rain bird C: rainy gull D: rain chicken\nRationales: Rain gull, rain bird, and rainy gull are not correct grammar. The rain gull should be 'bird', gulls is plural, so its singular form is 'gull'. In the same manner, rain bird should be 'bird', and rainy gull should be 'gull'.\nSince the question is 'this is _______' and the statement includes the word 'this', the choice 'rain gull' should be replaced by 'gull'. Similarly, the word 'bird' replaces the word 'gull' in 'rain bird' and rainy gull since it applies.\n\nSince the statement includes the word \u2018rain\u2019 as a predicate. In predicate noun phrase, the determiner (or article) should precede the noun.

Thus, of the rest of the options, only choice D - rocky hillside - is most appropriate.\n8. The idea of marmots being able to use their paw for clinging to rocky hillsides comes out due to the rock structure being taller and steeper, allowing marmots to use their paws for gripping. \n9.

Fall is probably the correct one because fall is a season, not a weather condition. Spring's climbing condition are similar to fall's, both are not snowy. Then, it's up to you to decide whether it's easier to climb in fall or in spring. \n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to start with the remaining options.\n5. If it is not possible to climb mountains in fall, then it's the boy can't climb. So climbing is not possible during fall, making fall season impossible.\n6. Then, look at the answer choices given:\n7. As the first option is either impossible or incomparable, we can eliminate A and B.\n8. If it wasn't possible to climb mountains, they couldn't be on a mountain because mountains don't move, and snowy-weather climbing is not possible because they wouldn't be on a mountaintop. \n9. Then, it comes down to C versus D. Including the information in the question, we can conclude that Option C fits", "answer": "E: hands"}

Therefore, the phrase is saying that they \"have hands that they can use\" to climb somewhere high.

Among these options, rocky hillside is the best fit.  \"Rocky hillsides\" are a common place to find marmots.\n5. There aren't many other places that might be so high they're outside, while remaining inaccessible by hand. A hill is an appropriate height for a marmot (or another small animal), but it isn't covered in rocks, and there wouldn't be anything for hand to grab onto.\n6. Finally, a jungle would not make sense, as jungles are usually low-lying areas near coasts in a tropical climate.\n7.

{"text": "asks us to think about what marmots can use to climb up to the top of these high places. Marmots are small creatures, so their hands would not be much use in climbing very tall trees. Hence, options B and C are eliminated since marmots don't really come across giant trees or jungles and trees are not the best option for climbing anyway as their grip does not allow these creatures to ascend very tall objects. \n3. The choice D, rocky hillside, would be a good option if it wasn't for the word 'rocky'. We don't see 'rocky' before the word 'hillside' so this would not be a logical place for marmots to live.\n4. Therefore, we are left with the options of A and E. Since the question only asked us to consider what the marmots could use to climb and does not make a specific mention of 'high' places, we can safely rule out option E. So now, we are left with A, outside.  \n5. 'Outside' could potentially mean that the choice 'outside' is correct, but by removing the comma and looking back at the question, 'outside' may also refer to something being in or above the high places. \n6. So, the most likely place for the marmots to find themselves is in or above the high place, which indicates that this would be high up in the trees.\n7.

{"text": "says that they have hands that they can \"use to get to the top\" of something.\n3. Out of the given choices - outside, hill, tree, jungle, and rocky hillside - trees, hills and jungle are unlikely to have an animal that uses its hands to climb up to the top, while outside and rocky hillside are not specified to be in high places.\n4. Therefore, the word that appropriately completes this incomplete sentence is \"hill\".\nAnswer: Hill:\n\nInput: What did the hunter do in the woods? Choices:  C: run through the woods D: track the animals E: avoid the wolves F: keep quiet\nRationales:\n1. The question uses the verb \"did' which indicates past action and it asks what the hunter did in the woods.\n2. The only option that gives the correct action and describes his activity in the woods is F: Keep quiet and avoid the wolves.\nAnswer: F: Keep quiet and stay away from the wolves\n\n##### In each problem below, the number of options, such as words and phrases, provided will not exceed the number of blanks. The question will include one blank. \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice questions.\n\n### Problem 1:What are you most likely to find near a dorm? Choices: A: bath B: bed C: kitchen D: television\n\nRationales: We can infer that a dorm is a place that students live in, as it is a common abbreviation for dormitory. \nThen, we can consider what is most likely to be found in a student's room. \nBased on this, answer A: bath is the most appropriate answer, as it is a commonly-found item that is relevant to students' day-to-day life. \n\nAnswer: A: Bath\n\n### Problem2:Which city will you find by searching for this? Choices: A. a mountain B. a lake C. a tree D. a cave\n\nRationales We need to decide what \"this\" in \"you will find by searching for this\" actually means. Based on the context, \"this\" refers to the question word, city. \nSince the question specifies cities, not mountains, lakes, trees and caves,", "answer": "B: large room"}
{"text": "goes on to tell us that the marmots are able to reach the top of something because they have 'hands'.\n3. The options here are A: outside (outdoor), B: hill, C: jungle, D, rocky hillside, and E: tree.\n4. By narrowing them down, it becomes more easily obvious that the answer is D: rocky hill side.\n5. The other options do not really suggest a place to be found at high places, unless otherwise stated.\nAnswer: D rocky hillside\n\nInput: The fishing expedition took much longer than anticipated What is the word that is best defined by 'anticipated'? Choices: 1. A: planned 2. B: expected 3. C: anticipated 4. D: surprised 5. E: hoped 6. F: imagined\nRationales: One way to answer this question is to first look at the words in the question and note where the emphasis is: the emphasis is on \"taking much longer than anticipated\". Knowing that the emphasis is on the highlighted portion helps us better understand the meaning of the sentence and narrow down answer choices.\nAnswer Choices:\nChoice A: \"planned\".  As the underlined portion states that it took \"much longer than anticipated\", it does not fit the context of the question. \nChoice B: \"expected\".  Although this answer choice can be in line with the context of the question (i.e. someone planned for the fishing expedition to last a few hours, but it actually took much more time), there is no indication in the source text to support this choice. Therefore, this can be eliminated. \nChoice C: \"anticipated\".  The choice is highly likely in light of the emphasis. \nChoice D: \"surprised\". While this word is related to the situation in the highlighted sentence, it is unlikely to fit the overall meaning of the entire sentence and is therefore not the correct answer.\nChoice E: \"hoped\".  This word would contradict the context of the sentence as it implies that the fishing expedition was only done to meet someone's expectations. In this case, the sentence would not make sense as the expedition was long and was not caused to meet someone's expectation. Furthermore, the word \"hoped\" seems out of place and", "answer": "A: sail boats"}
{"text": "explains that they have hands that they can be used to get to the top. \n3. Hands are a biological feature found in many organisms, including humans, as well as marmots.\n4. They should help them climb to get to a high place, but do not give any clue about what object they can use to climb.\n5. So options B, C, and D are eliminated because there are many biologically plausible objects that we can use to climb, and those are not mentioned in the options.\n6. Option E is eliminated because marmot is not a natural climber due to its hands. Marmot can only get to a high place with the help of other objects. Thus, no hand, no marmot.\n7. Therefore, the answer has to be D: rocky hill side.\nAnswer: D. rocky hillside\n\nInput: How are ants different than bees? Choices: 1. A: they have different venom 2. B: they eat different food 3. C: have different wings 4. D: have different stings 5. E: have different hives\nRationales: We know that ants and bees are related, hence ants must be different in some way from bees. \n1. Ants and bees both have wings. If ants had completely different wings from bees they would not be able to fly. Therefore, we can eliminate option B: they eat different types of food.\n2. Bees and ants have different venom, so option A: they have different type of venom is the logical choice.\n3. There is difference in ants and bees wings. Ants have wings, and sometimes bees as well. But, the venom is the key differentiation between bees and ants.\n4. Bees can sting to defend themselves, but ants can't. So, option D: bees can sting but ants can' t, is the right answer.\n5. Option E: bees have different hives is wrong. \n\nAnswer: D: Bees can sting but Ants can't.", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}
{"text": "asks us where marmots' hands can go.\n3. Option A: \"outside\" doesn't make sense because marmots' hands need to go upwards in order to reach higher places.\n4. Option B: \"hill\" could work because hills can be found in higher places, but this is too broad of an answer and could potentially be true in some scenarios but not others. \n5. Option C: \"jungle\" can't be true because jungles aren't necessarily higher places and the sentence uses \"up\" before \"hands\", implying an upwards movement.\n6. Option D: \"rocky hillside\". Rocky hillside doesn't make sense as it still doesn't use \"hands\" and marmots don't have the dexterity to climb sheer rock faces without special equipment. \n7. Option E: \"tree\". Marmots' hands can't be found on trees as their hands are too small to support their weight.\n8. Therefore the correct answer is D: rocky hill because rocky hills are a type of high place and marmots use their hands to get to the top.\nAnswer: D. rocky hill\n\nInput: If the bird had escaped the snake it might have been what? Choices: A: in a tree B: on the ground C: outside D: in a bush E: near a house\nRationales: Answer is A: in a tree. First, eliminate option B: on the ground because snakes can attack from the ground. Also, a bird can only stand a chance to escape a snake if it's in a tree, not on the ground.\n\nInput: Which part of the boat goes out into the sea? Choices: A. helm B. prow C. stern D. keel E. deck\nRationales: Deck is a place on a boat, not an outside part.\n\n### Challenge:This challenge will test your ability to analyze information and make appropriate choices.\n\n### Input:If you had a good feeling about a friend's decision to quit a job, which would you be more likely to say?

{"text": "specifically mentions 'hands' which can help us narrow down the choice:\n3. Option C: jungle. Marmots do not typically have hands, let alone use them.\n4. Options B, C, and E all have both trees and hills.  Hills usually only require the feet to reach the top. \n5. Option D: rocky hill side. Marmots likely have paws and claws that allow them to easily dig through the rocky surface. They can also use their tail to balance and steer in order to reach the top of such a surface.\n6. Therefore we select D: rocky hill-side.\nAnswer: D : rocky hill-side\n\n### Solution:\nThe question describes a complex machine. The choice of apparatus fits it most appropriately because an apparatus tends to be an intricate device. Also, the answer is a noun. \n\nThe question asks where someone might obtain petrol. The gas station is the first and only option that refers to a station that sells petrol. Petrol is not normally found in a car. \n\nThe two answers, 'Bedroom' and 'University' describe situations where television is typically used at night. Answers not related to bedrooms and university tend to fall away. \n1. The question uses 'unlike' to connect sentences. The 'knowledge is expensive to obtain' would indicate that the answer should be from a place where knowledge usually is expensive. \n2. 'University' fulfills this requirement. A book, a field, and a meeting can all also be places where knowledge is gained. However, those also have a cost associated with them. University is typically where the majority of someone's education takes place. \n3. The option of classroom, which includes lectures, is a subset of university and does not fit the specifications as it is a place where knowledge is gained. Since a classroom is most likely to be involved, we eliminate this option. \nThe classroom is the only option that could relate to the knowledge being expensive to gain. \n\nThe questions asks specifically for'small grapes'. \n\nGrapes are found in these places:\nLunchbox - Grape varieties (red/green/seedless), Grape Concentrate Grape Spread \nFood store - Grape varieties, Gra", "answer": "A: zoo"}
{"text": "asks what can marmots use their \"hands\" for. The word \"hands\" suggests paws. We know marmots have paws because we know that they can be found in high areas. Paws are a natural part of the marmot's body, and the question suggests a use for paws, which are necessary for climbing a rocky hillside.\n3. The choices given are 'outside', 'hill', 'jungle', 'rocky hillside', 'tree.'\n4.  The marmot won't need to go outside, as it can only be found high up. It also won't need to use its paws to move, as it can do this on its own. \n5. Similarly, a marmot cannot go to a jungle or a tree as they are too low for a marmot to reach. \n6. Among the given choices, only 'rocky hillside' requires paws to climb it, which would answer the question appropriately.\nAnswer: E rocky hillside\n\nInput: When a child is young, he often dreams of what? Choices A: his mother's attention B: his father's love C: his school-friends D: fame E: his own success\nRationales:  1. The child has been referred to as \"it\" (indefinite pronoun). \n2. Then the sentence asks about dreams that are common for such children. The choice is to indicate a common dream among such children.\n3. Considering all the choices, only \u2018his own success\u2019 could fit among the dreams listed for such children.\n4. Therefore the correct answer is E: his own success.\nAnswer: E his own success\nInput: Why does a small group usually meet frequently? Choices A: because they have a lot to discuss B: to make up for time missed due to previous meetings C: so that they can have more time to discuss together D: to ensure that they discuss all the important issues E: for various reasons\nRationales: None of the answers are incorrect. Only the answer that is most probable is the answer.\nAnalysis:  Because they have a lot to discus\nAnswer: D: To ensure that they discuss all important issues\n\nInput: What happens when students study for one hour?

{"text": "asks about the hands of a Marmot. Hands are something that animals may or may not have. The question is more about the places where Marmots can be found than animals.\n3. Option A: outside. We may generally find an outdoor area where there are high places. Options C and D could potentially be high places, but they are unclear and uninteresting answers.\n4. Option B: hill. A hill is a likely place we would find a Marmot because of the question.\n5. Option E: tree. A tree is an uninteresting place to have a Marmot if it can't be outside the tree, since then a Hill sounds more likely to be on top of.\n6. Option B: hill is the only interesting place and the only choice to be kept. Thus, it is the answer to the question.\nAnswer: B. hill\n\nInput: Why did he want a ticket? The airline couldn't provide accommodation in what? Choices: A: office B: room C: bus D: tent E: tent\nRationales: We want to figure out what is so important to the passenger who wants a ticket that the airline could not provide accommodation. \n1. Out of the possible reason(s), a bus is far the least likely, so the passenger's demand is exempted from it.\n2. A tent accommodation was a more common demand, more so than an office or a room. Therefore, Option D: tent is the best option due to the passenger's demand and exclusion of the bus.\n3. Finally, it is possible that someone would need a ticket to travel to reach some special accommodation. If that is the case, then the passenger could indeed be demanding a tent. \n4. From that we can conclude that Option E: tent is the best answer here.\nAnswer: E. tent\n\nInput: Why was the boat sinking? Choices:  The screws were loose. A: the ship was old. B: it was stormy. C: the boat had problems D: the ocean tide  E: the holes were not properly fixed\nRationales: For a boat to sink, there must be either leaks or some other type of structural failure. Given this, there are only five possible ways for a boat to sink. \n1. One of the boats was old", "answer": "C: bar"}

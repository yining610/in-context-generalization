Before you can install your drain, you must first find where the sink drain is.<n><n>Your drain is a hole drain on the sides of the sink with an elongated shape (think a pegasus's head, but without the horse part). To find the hole, you walk around your home, observing the plumbing. You try to find places where the water will naturally drain. Where do you think the hole of your drain would be?<n><n>A good place for the hole could be near the water fountain because it would make sense that the water would drain out of the fountain as if its coming from the sink; another good location would be the shower because of the high volumes of water; another location is the wall because the wall would obviously take more water out than the toilet and the floor. Lastly, your drain could be at the floor in the bathroom because the bathroom is the sink's main area.<n><n>Another example is a large sink that's not leaking, the plumber would need to look around for the hole and place the drain accordingly so as not to create a bad smell.

Variables are variables that are used as variables. You can think of these as the building blocks of programming. The simplest programming language is called the language of "Hello"<n><n>>Programming languages are usually divided into general purpose languages like Python that can do almost anything you can describe, and domain specific languages like Python that work well for certain problems. So far, we have focused only on general purpose languages and have not looked at a domain specific language.<n><n><n><n>In this chapter we are going to be introduced to variables and why programming is needed. We will be focusing on Python for this guide, but other languages follow the same general principles.<n><n><n><n>#### Variables<n><n>Programming is a lot like baking cookies (there's always some kind of analogy). In baking, you only use a limited amount of ingrediants and each ingrediant has a name.<n><n>So in the previous code, the variable c is a variable which was set to 1. The c variable cannot take a value that is bigger than 1. Python cannot perform all math operations. As a result we have introduced a new concept; an operator, but lets leave them for another day. Python also has the concept of a string, which we will introduce to in this chapter as well.<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>Input: What is the length of the first python string, "Python"<n>Output: 12<n><n><n><n>### Instractions:<n><n>Input<n>    Python is a high-level, Object-Oriented language<n>Output:<n>    Python is a Python language<n><n><n><n>## Instructions:<n>Create a variable called my_string,

How do I refer to the object that will be chosen?<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>To do this, you can pass an object into the class constructor. Once the object has been passed, use **this.** The object that is referred to is the object we have just passed and not the object where the constructor is called. **this** refers to __the object that was initialized.__<n><n><n>Here's an example of code I wrote for you to use in class:<n><n>```javascript<n>function Employee(name){<n>  this.name = name;<n>  //this refers to the Employee we just passed into the constructor<n>}<n>Employee.prototype.getFullName = function(){<n>  return this.name;<n>}<n>```<n><n>Or this:<n>```javascript<n>function Pet(name){<n>  //this refersto the Pet we just passed into the Pet constructor<n>  this.name=name;<n>  //in the Pet constructor, we set the properties up once and will have them available to any Pet objects we create<n>}<n>Pet.prototype.getFullname = function(){<n>  //we create an'return this.name' in the Pet.prototype<n>  return this.Name;<n>}<n>``` <n><n>Once we have defined our properties within our prototype, we can now reuse our code. This is called a 'proxy' object.<n>```javascript<n>//once we have defined our prototype within Pet.js<n>//Pet.prototype<n>Puppy.js<n>function Puppy(name){<n>  return new Pet(name);<n>}<n>```<n>This makes your Puppy object also have a name property to Puppy

Each question consists of 5 choices. Choose the _correct_ answer from the choices given in each question. _Note:_ In each question, the right answer should only be chosen if it is _correct_. For example, the first question is: What are you possibly not doing if you have a thirsty desire?<n>There are 5 choices: A: Where are you not thirsty?; B: Where are you not being given water?; C: Where are you not getting water?; D: Where are you looking at water?; E: Where are you trying to get water?<n>The correct answer is A: _Where_ are you _not_ thirsty?<n>The right answer here could be: Where are you not drinking water?, Where are you not drinkable? or Where are you not thirt?<n>Each question contains only one answer.<n>In each question there is only one correct answer and each question contains 5 choices.<n>The right answer is B. This is clear from the fact that in the first question: "Where is there usually a fiddling playing", the right answer is B. (The fiddle is an instrument played by musicians; it produces a pleasing musical sound.)<n>The right answer is D. This is clear from a mathematical expression: "If you _are_ tired, then you are not resting. So, you are not _beginning_ work."<n>The right answer is C. This is clear from some simple mathematics. If you say, then you are not working, we know you cannot dance (dance and dancing have 2 syllables while, 'are not working" has 4 syllables). Hence, you are not working. If you are working, then you are getting tired and if you are getting tired, you cannot do anything else (tiredness is not limited to dancing; it can also cause tiredness in other forms, so, tiredness and work cannot both happen at the same time to one person). Also, you may decide not to start anything else if you are

Choices:  M: carapace size B: gender C: legs D: food E: habitat<n>Output: B: gender<n><n>Answer: The key to getting this question right is to read it slowly and take your time. We are looking for the first letter of each line. "Where could you find some plum..." refers to "plumbing" and is missing from the choices given. "Where could you..." indicates that the plumbing is someplace else. Choice B, wall, is the only place other than yourself that would provide the plumbing. Choice A, oil refineries is not incorrect, as plumbing can be made of oil refined materials. But we want water, not oil, and we want it to go in, not out. A plumbing system is what you are seeking, as plumbing is not someplace else. Choose B.<n><n>"When a person is beginning..." refers to "work". We are looking for something that isn't happening yet. The choices given are in the present tense, so we can choose past tense, which would indicate the opposite of what is happening now. Choice D, accomplishing is incorrect, because this would mean the person has something else that they are about to accomplish, which isn't the case. Momentum is defined as "the impulse given to a moving body or system by the impenetrable medium which the body or system is passing through" meaning it would not be present yet. Choice E, momentum, is correct.<n>"James used the cannon..." refers to "lunch" which should be an animal. Choice A is incorrect because plumbing is "a system of pipes and fixtures in a building; also :the materials, fixtures, and equipment needed to supply plumbing facilities in a building."<n>"A turtle is not..." refers to "tortoise" which should be animals. Choice E is incorrect because plumbling is "a system of..." (which they already know) and "...fixtures..." (which they haven't specified yet) and so they must have an "animal" (which they have already specified as "ungulate"). Choice D is not incorrect, but this sentence does

Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n>Output:		A: art show<n><n>### Solution:The main concept behind the Oil and water question was that we need to get different sets of inputs when we are trying multiple queries. We have to use the fact that oil and water don't mix because otherwise we will end up with a set of inputs that will cause our code to fail. Same logic applies to every other question, the main thing is to think differently about the input to get the answer.<n><n>### Reference:<n><n>1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming

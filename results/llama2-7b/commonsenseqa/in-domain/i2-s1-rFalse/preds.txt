Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n><n>### Response:		A: D<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>1: The body's skin is the largest organ in animals. The purpose of the skin is to minimize the impact of injuries or discomfort, due to exposure to harmful external factors, including hot or cold, chemicals, disease, sunlight, water, and abrasion. The skin protects and insulates while also acting as a sensory organ. The skin also allows for the generation of vitamin D from cholesterol when sunlight is used for it, and it can also maintain body temperature through the use of sweating in hot environments, through the formation of frost on exposed skin when exposed to extremely cold environments, and by maintaining the temperature for homeostasis of the body in hot environments and cold environments. (Due to its sensitivity to the environment, skin is particularly vulnerable to infections or irritants).<n><n>2: <n>

Choices:  A: station B: every car and house C: shop D: bedroom E: space shuttle<n><n>### Response:		<n>Based upon the question, one cannot say that going to an oil refinery will help in satisfying the need for water because oil refineries require different resources like crude oil. There are places where one could obtain water on an oil refinery but this is mostly for the purpose of fire, and they are not intended to be used for drinking. Therefore, they won't produce water. On a different note, not until a person has started work, then they don't get to accomplish anything at all. For example, on a business establishment, you will find that at the beginning of day, employees are yet to start work and the only thing that they do at that moment is to go to the water fountain and have enough drinking water which they may possibly need for the beginning of the day. Therefore, the answer is E. The remaining choices are only valid during the process of work or when a person is working.<n>

Syntax errors<n>Python allows you some liberties but also follows its own grammar. Anything that doesn't meet the requirements of these grammar rules is a syntax error. So Python's syntax errors fall into:<n><n>* Undefined variables<n>* Invalid expression<n>* Invalid assignment<n>* Invalid assignments<n><n>```python<n># python lint command<n>$ python -m pylint --disable-disallowed-name-paterns <filename>.py<n>```<n><n>### 3.

Even though blank lines are generally considered harmless and not necessary to your code, they may cause problems if you're working on code with other people. Because nobody wants to work with any form of code without blank lines. Having a single blank line that breaks the code up is fine, but if the first line of your code is empty you've already violated this rule. The Linter, therefore, will flag this

Choices:  A: carpet B: refrigerator C: breadbox D: fridge E: coach<n><n>### Response:		A: carpet<n>### Criteria:The forgotten lefthanded, he found it covered is a reference to his fridge. In the last sentence of the paragraph, we are informed that "there were lefthanded leftovers", which means that leftovers were unintentionally overlooked. However they have now been "found" because they are leftovers he has forgotten. This reference is made clear by stating that they were "...quite old". This gives a sense of them being left behind, and covered in mold in accordance with the fact that they were not intentionally put in his fridge but in his carpet instead.<n>### Input:When you have been in the same position more than a month, it can become very difficult to maintain which of the following state's of being?Choices:  A: sleep B: exhaustion C: lethargy D: anger E: confusion<n><n>### Criteria:"When you have been in....." means that it is difficult to maintain being in this state of being when it was a longer period of time that one. It therefore leads toward an answer such as lethargy, confusion and/or fatigue that are answers that refer to timespan of time because these are the answers relating to being in this state for a much longer period of time. Lethargy refers to the physical fatigue of someone. Confusion is related to the mental or emotional state of a person, and confusion leads to lethargy and exhaustion. These would be the most appropriate and correct answers considering the context of the task.<n><n>### Input:"They are not always at their best, but they are always at their worst." means that they are not at their best or their worst permanently, but that they can change from being at their best to being at their worst at any given time.

They can be happy one minute, and angry the next due to a situation and then this leads to them being happy once more.<n><n>### Response:"Who is referring to these words of wisdom?"<n><n>### Response(answer):The words of wisdom that the sentence contains refer to his grandfather, and they therefore refer to the grandfather because they were given to him to help him make the correct decision.

Choices:  A: indiana B: england C: outside D: on the wall E: picture<n><n>### Response:		 Outside.<n><n>I'm using a loop through a for loop, so everytime I make the loop go, I append a new char to the file in txt. The for loop is then supposed to create a file called cows in the same directory. Lastly, the text file is to be read and analyzed. I had a problem where I received the input as a list of lines and not as a list of strings, so I had to use replaceList() to convert the list into one of strings.<n><n>*The only reason that I didn't use str.split() was so that I could pass in a string and be guaranteed that I was getting the input in the form that it needs to be (a list not a string). If I used.split(), then each element in the list would be of different size based on the number of spaces in the input string, I need elements that are a consistent length so that I can do things I want. Also, I can't tell you why because I do not fully understand str.split, but I do know that it is different than str.split()*

Choices:  A: sign language B: complete sentence C: drink tea D: feel angry E: cross street<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>In the first example of the question, the answer is A.  The request is asking where you find some plumbling that would not be of if you were thirsty.  It makes sense that you wouldn't find plumbing if you were thirst, this makes sense where you are likely to find plumbing would be in a oil refinery.<n><n>In the second example, the answer is D.

Since the word doesn't have a lot of synonyms you can just google the meaning.  To summarize, you find it's meaning using a crossword dictionary or you ask someone if you don't know what it means.<n>

Choices: A preposition, verb, adjective, noun, and adverb<n><n>#### Instruction:<n>1. This is the second section of this project.  Give an accurate representation of your project, not just a description or a photo of your work.<n><n>#### Response:<n>- The first sentence starts with a question about the question.  That is good because it asks us a question.  It starts with the word "Where" noticing that the person is talking about the oil refineries.  The next sentence shows an adjuctive phrase "A person" but it also shows a proper noun "A gentleman is very wealth" which tells you that the subject is a male.  The rest of the sentence describes what the person does in the oil refineries and shows that he is actually living at home on his own.  The last sentence starts with a positive statement saying that he flaunts it and has an adjectival phrase "flaunts it" which tells you that money is very important to him.  As for the whole sentence, it is very descriptive and has accurate information.  However, the person could be living outside of his home and still flaunt money as long as he is in an environment that he is familiarized with.<n>- The sentence is 15 words.  There are a total of 3 sentences. The first sentence explains who is the subject in this situation and where they live.  That is one sentence which is 4 words long.  The second sentence tells you what the subject does in the other houses and then you read that the sentence is finished with the statement "and then it shows you where they might live".  That's 2 sentences and 2 words with one of them ending the sentence.  As for the third sentence, it says the answer with the word "and" linking it back to the previous sentence you just read.  That is another sentence that is 4 words long

Choices:  A: cabinet B: library C: nightstand D: stationery store E: desk drawer<n><n>### Response:		B<n><n>### Input<n>The book for the class was the first book John ever read and it is an encyclopedia of humanity and wisdom.  He had always wanted to read this book and was never given the chance to do so.<n>Answer:I have had to wait to read this.<n><n>### A<n>#### Input: The question, which is more dangerous: being in the car during a tornado or on the roof of a skyscraper during an earthquake?<n>When looking at these two questions, their answers should be easily seen for which is the more dangerous scenario.  Being in the car during a strong tornado will almost always cause death, and in rare cases death is not always guaranteed.  This scenario will almost always come with a great deal of fatalities.  It will most likely begin with the roof of the car being torn off and the car being flipped and the driver then run over.  The driver will also most likely be left with severe, life-altering injuries.  One would almost always die in a tornado after experiencing this.  On the roof of a skycraper, being in an earthquake, you will most likely be fine, unless your building's roof is broken.  You can survive this scenario, although earthquakes will begin to cause people's attention to be more on saving themselves, and it is during the panic that you can fall off the roof.  You will still most likely be alive.<n>#### Demonstration: The answer to which is more dangerous: Being in the car during tornado or skycraper in earthquake?  (which is more dangerous? Be in a tornado or on top of a skyscrape during an earthquaker)<n><n>Answer: The answer is the tornado, because in the tornado a person could be thrown from the car and there are very little possibilities for the car to still be standing. Being in an earthquake is much more doable without severe damage.<n><n>### B<n>#### Input: Heidi, whose mother was working on her doctorate degree at the university, was the first student to arrive to the university library.

Choices: A: kitchen B: porch C: dining room D: bedroom E: front yard<n><n>Response:C:dining room<n><n># Output<n>Response:C: dining room<n><n># Explanation<n>The first answer provided was an acronym that stood for a question that included the phrase _"which is not"_. This indicated that an answer choice was the reverse of the request that was being fulfilled. A second answer made a mistake with the response when writing what kind of task they were doing. This could have caused the first answer not to be accepted. A bonus question was a question asking about the location of something. This would have to be considered before any answer.<n><n># Commentary<n>This task was extremely helpful with the explanation that was provided. The request was very vague and required the user to consider many items that were not mentioned. The lack of clarification could be considered a negative and the lack of a specific request could be considered a positive. The task would have a more positive outcome if it had been clearer. Some examples might provide a more specific response from the bot.<n><n># Final Thoughts<n>In conclusion, the bot performed well in providing an answer to all of the tasks. There were a few missteps in the conversation that could be fixed with better communication and a more specific description. This task would be improved through a better understanding of the instructions.<n><n>

Choices:  A: switzerland B: pennsylvania C: picture D: asia E: austria<n><n>### Response:		Answer three of the following questions. You can use the sample response document for each answer as a reference.<n>    1. What is the difference between a job and a job?<n>    Answer: The difference between and and a job is that a job is not always a job. To be a job you can't just do it once and never do it again. So for example if you are working for McDonald's as a waitress, that would be a job, but if you work for Subway as a waiter that's not always a job, because sometimes the owner of Subway will hire another person in place of you. So it all depends on how much money you are making with your income. It's also true if you are working two part-time jobs as a busboy for two restaurants at once, that won't always be jobs either because usually the owners (managers) will fire you after a while so there goes that job.<n>        The difference between and and an isn't just one job because it can be different depending on the situation. For instance if a customer asks for one job then he or she wants me to serve them some beer and not just any beer, but their favorite beer, that isn't like a job because usually if someone orders a beer it's because they know they'll be drinking that much alcohol. So that isn't just one person telling the customer about his favorite beer, that is two people (including me) telling him what I've got to offer him.<n>2. What is the difference in a "man" and a "man"?<n>        Answer: Two similar words are "man" and "man". Both words mean the same thing which is "a man".<n>2. What is a "man" (A common name for a man)?<n>    Answer: A "man" is what we call a person when we want to use the word "man" in something that's a little less offensive and less harsh, like in a story or maybe something that's true and not something you're making up.<n>3. What is a "woman"?<n>    Answer: A woman is what makes up the other gender in a relationship or a relationship where the relationship is between a man and a woman.<n>4. Is "man" the same as "woman"?<n>        Answer: No, "man"

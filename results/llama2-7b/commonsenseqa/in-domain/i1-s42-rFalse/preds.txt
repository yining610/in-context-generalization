Choices:  A: near B: closeness C: here D: proximity E: this<n><n>### Response:		<n>The input says that the what kind of sensor sensed the distance and set off an alarm. The word "the" should be removed since the phrase "sensor would" means that the sensor does the sensing.

I understand that the sensor is a what kind, but this does not necessarily mean that it is sensing anything.<n><n>#### E: (This response is incorrect)<n>The what kind of of word for sensor? The installation expert didn't explain what kind of sensor, but it doesn't matter which one it is because that doesn't really matter when it comes to how the alarm works, but the sensor is what actually senses distances in the home and sets off the alarm.<n><n>### Input<n><n>The security company that the contractor referred my house to?

How can the student check to see if a character is in the wrong place?<n><n>### Instructure: Answer the questions in the prompt.<n><n>### Follow-Up: A group of students designed an algorithm for a text editor. <n><n><n>```<n>        #1 The best way to check what the number of elements of a string is.<n>        #define num_of_elements(string)<n>        #2 To count the number of characters in a string.<n>        #define count_of_character(string)<n>```<n><n>### Problem: A student is designing an algorithm to edit a text. They decided on using a text editor. However, they have not been able to devise a process that would allow a user to insert an exclamation point, but they've managed to add a space in the correct location. In this problem, you will need to fill in missing blocks for the rest of their algorithm. <n><n>A student has created a text edit program. There are two functions that define the user interface:<n><n>1. `input(STRING_name);` This allows the user to type in a string.<n>2. `output(STRING_name);` The output function prints the entered string to the console.<n> <n>Each function has two variables:<n>1. `var = string variable` This variable assigns the input or output string variable so the programmer knows that a given output is for a specific string.<n>2.  `current_string` The current_string variable allows the programmer to track the string that the function currently is on. <n><n>The user asks the function to place an `exclamation point` in a given location within the current string variable. The `end_of_string` function terminates the current string the program is on.<n><n>### Questions:<n><n>1. What happens if the string has the correct number of spaces, but has a punctuation mark that is in the wrong place.<n><n><n><n>---<n>© 2022 Trilogy Education

Because the evidence that has come to light in recent years doesn’t leave much leeway for charitably interpreting the abuse of power.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:Where does someone not happy to take their car? Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n><n>### Response:		A car is more than just a vehicle it is a place of solace. Many people use their cars as a place to think work out, or even sleep. This is understandable considering that the car is usually an escape from the city. Many people who work in the countryside live in the city in order to get to work. Those people are then subject to the hustle and bustle which then is their normal day. However they use their car to escape. They go home, drive straight into the garage and leave the hustle at work where the do not have to deal with it. That car gives them peace and quiet. But this is not necessarily a bad thing. The only way a society can grow and become a little more sophisticated is to step into the unknown. This unknown, for many, is the city. It has all the comforts of home but yet so much more. When these people have a problem they can turn to their cars to fix them. This gives their job a much greater meaning because it allows people who take problems in the cars apart to not just earn money but to be able to have an impact to the city. In addition, a car gives someone a purpose. Whether it is getting up and driving to the store or getting in the car after a hard day of work, a person has a sense of pride and accomplishment because they have a car of their very own.<n><n>### Screenshot:<n><img src="https://github.com/BrianMiller17/CS180-Project-1/blob/main/CS180/Project%201%20-%20Multiple%20Choice.PNG" ><n><n>### Source:<n>10439_1542457483239.png<n>29247292008809.png<n><n>### Resources:<n>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwJ1o-Hp3u9Q1UoT212bnp4xBd14R8f2pJkCxLW5GbY/edit?usp=sharing

Choices:  A: city centre B: lottery ticket C: maps D: street E: busy city<n><n>### Response:		<n>There could be many things that you find at a bus stop that helps you. Some of these things could include city centers. A city center would be a perfect place to look for stores, food and drinks, and also places to relax. If you were to just look at the outside of a city center it doesn't seem like there is much too look at but if you walked inside you can do shopping, eat some food at a restaurant, and also relax. This all helps you and can make any ride to a bus stop pleasurable. <n><n>### Test:<n>A bus station is known for being the place where you get off a bus. Many people will use them when they are on their way to work or need transportation. They may be a little expensive depending on what type of bus you are taking and also because of how far you are going. Some bus tickets can range around 10-20 dollars. Another way to get a bus is to take the metro. Some of the metro lines are even less.<n><n>These are useful tips on how you can get to a bus. This is important as people must travel in order to get transportation and travel for work. <n><n>## Link<n>[Back to the list](https://github.com/HackerRank/javascript-algorithms/blob/master/README.md)

You could also try to do the task and use the output to double<n>check that the solution works, as well as the answer.<n>- If you do any of those steps, you should always include the question in your solution. This is also a good<n>practice for interviews because it's always good to remember what you were given and what was being asked of you.<n>

Choices:  A: wrong B: death of C: bad D: negative E: evil<n><n>### Response:		<n>Answer: A: bad<n><n>There are several things you should look out for in this question if you get one. The first is that there is going to be a choice of three different sentences, which you can see in the example. The second is that you will see four "answer" choices, which should always have the right wording so it's easier to tell what answers are correct or incorrect. You'll also see the word "Answer" instead of a question mark, but that's another part of the question that makes things a bit easier when you are trying to determine what the answer might be.<n><n>To find the correct answer to a coding question, you should first review the sentence and make sure that the question you are asked asks for a complete sentence. If you're unsure about this, you can also go through the question again, but this time mark off every part of speech as you read it so you'll know what kind it needs to be. If the question asks for a sentence in the past, you want to write one in the past. If the question asks you to write something in the present tense, you need to write it in the present tense.<n><n>As you are reading the sentences, you should always take into account whether or not it's asking for something specific. For example, some of these questions will want you to provide an example. You'll know when you've found an example question because it will be asking for a specific example that you need to provide. Examples would include: what word does it end on? When did it happen? or any similar phrasing.<n><n>## Examples<n><n>### Example I<n><n>"What do you think about people who drive expensive cars on the freeway, what does it mean, and are they entitled to drive like that?"<n><n>Answer:<n>A: I don't like seeing people drive around in such expensive cars on the freway.<n>B: People who drive expensive cars on freeways are a symbol of greed.<n>C: It doesn't mean nothing, people just want to show off I guess.<n>D: I think that people deserve to drive what they want on the highway.<n>E: People who drive expensive supercars on freeways are entitled to drive faster then you.<n><n>### Example II<n><n>"What do they call people who enjoy being outside in the summertime?"<n><n>

Choices:  A: remember B: help C: count D: winning E: dealing<n><n>### Response:		It is illegal to count cards at a casino. Counting cards is only against federal gambling laws. Counting cards (using a certain card as a count or assigning values to cards helps to reduce the odds. Counting aids in calculating the probability of a win or loss. The casino or house typically has an edge over the player and wants to keep the edge. Therefore the casinos outlaw the counting. One of the best gambling tips is to never count cards. If the casinos didn't like people to count cards, they'd never have such a widely believed "superstition."<n>---<n><n>### Input :What does it mean to be 'gay' these days?

(Incidentally I also heard my mother use the term to mean fun, but there was only a slight difference in definitions. Happiness was primary and fun was a'side-benefit'.<n><n>

Choices:  A: deceptive B: altruistic C: stupid D: cruel E: agressive<n><n>### Response:		I do think you should be careful as well to avoid using these social media because of all the negative effects including bullying and cyber crime. I can't think of anything else that would be good about it, except for to keep in touch with people you would miss. The best you could do if you wanted to be more productive while using social media, would be to limit the time you spend on social media while you're at work.

I believe that if you follow the instructions, and do extra homework for whatever assignments you receive, you will be more prepared when it comes to the tests. I believe if you ask questions it will help you understand things better, and if you go to the teacher when you are having trouble, you will be able to get help. That is the best and

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:What do people want to do when they love a place that they are going on vacation in? Choices:  A: pleasant thoughts B: overspending C: moving there D: staying there E: debt<n><n>### Response:		<n>* Answer: B) Moving There<n>    <n><n>### Instructions:<n><n> 1. Describe why you think your answer is correct.<n><n> 2. Include the steps you would take to verify that your response is correct.<n>* Answer: I think my answer is correct because I remember that I thought about a house in the mountains of Colorado and I loved looking at it. That made me think that maybe I could move there <n>* Answer: I would verify that my response is correct by looking at what the word love means, and see if that is how or what it applies to moving to a new location. And by using what is and is not in the prompt.<n><n> 1. How many minutes do you feel was allotted for the task? (Be sure to consider the time it takes for the question to be read and responded to). <n>*Answer: It felt like there was about 2 hours of time allowed.<n><n>2. How much total time did you take to complete the task? (Be specific and provide an estimate and a rationale)<n>*Answer:The reading task actually felt like it took about 20-30 minutes to complete, because each of the choices and questions had some specific thought process needed to think about in some way. It could probably be done more quickly, but I wanted to do my best, and be a little careful, as I have only recently started to study for ACT and SAT and felt I was struggling a bit there until I took this practice test. So I wanted to do a bit better this time out of practice. I actually have less than 1 hour to complete it and didn't have time to read it carefully through each time (and had to read some of the questions more than once to make sure I understood each correctly because it was a little difficult to understand all at once exactly how and where I could even use this word, and I think most of the words are similar enough, that I thought about some other words first before thinking about this one.) <n><n> 1. Did it feel like you had more or less time? Did the actual time taken to complete the task impact the quality of your response? <n>* I think it did a tiny bit in that if I had more time, I might be able to consider other terms that were similar too, and I also might have used more specific language too.<n>

Choices:  A: joining B: put together C: stitch D: heal E: paste<n><n>### Response:		<n>I found this question a bit challenging, as I have little knowledge of scars. However, I believe that, based on the information learned through this course, the correct answer to this question is that ‘figurative scars would never heal’. I reached this conclusion by first understanding the definition of cut and then analyzing the sentence in question.<n><n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>After some thinking and research, you have developed 3 questions based on things people often consider (and often don’t consider) when they enter a job role. Your questions relate to what you believe are the most common things people encounter when they start working in a new role. Which of the following questions are you correct in selecting for your new company? Choose three:  A: Has the job been outsourced? B: Will I have time to eat lunch? C: Will I need to learn a new computer program? D: How often will I need to work overtime due to work requirements? E: Where do I eat lunch?<n><n><n>### Response<n>I believe that the correct answers to these questions is:<n><n>- Has the job been out-sources? I would choose this question because it is important for people to know that their job isn’t going to be outsourced if they’re going to spend more time trying to get there hours worked up.<n><n>- Where do I eat luch. I would choose this question, since it is one of the most important things about a job, and if you are in a place where you have to choose where to eat lunch, then it’s important that you have places to choose from that are acceptable options.<n><n>- Will I need to learn new computer program? I would choose this answer because if someone doesn’t know how to use one program on a computer, then how will they ever be able to use all of the other programs that may be available for them to use in an office or at home?

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>### Input:To learn must have the right book, to work efficiently what must one have? Choices:  A: improve yourself B: become knowledgeable C: have tools D: persistence E: have more knowledge<n><n>### Response:		 The correct answer is A<n><n>### Reason:<n>The instruction above includes an incorrect verb in the form of "learned". In all scenarios where the verb is "learning" or "learned", the "verb+past tense" combination is correct. The right approach that takes into account the fact that the instruction includes this phrase is replacing "learned" with "learned/ed" in the response. The following is the response:To have a what must one have? A: Learned/ed B: Improve yourself C: Become knowledgeable D: Have tools E: Persistence<n><n>Answer: The correct answer is A: Learned/Ed<n><n>## AI-based Response:<n>The instruction above begins with the phrase with the present tense of the verb "fantasized" which is "is fantasizing" not "is fantasizing/ed". The correct approach that takes into account this fact is replacing "is fantasizing", "fantasizes", or any other verb with another variation of the verb "is fantasizing". The following is the response based on the correct verbs:<n><n>Input: He is fantasizing of getting a what while driving and the pros and cons? Choices: 1 A: new car B 2: promotion C? 3 : boredom D: 4: impatience E: 5: pressure<n><n>Answer: C:The correct answer is A<n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits?

Choices:  A: shame B: arrest C: embarrassment D: go to jail E: tension<n><n>### Response:		<n>Choose the letter of the best answer.<n><n>### Input<n>I was afraid of being lonely while working abroad from home.  I was wrong. The reason is that it took a long time for me to be able to meet people around me. I don’t think so much about whether you can work with people around you or what kind of lifestyle.   However, I was always afraid of doing something wrong and being lonely. I made a lot of effort not to get lost. One day, a very unexpected thing happened. I decided to be with foreign exchange students in a bar near the house as usual. A foreign student asked me about my job. When I started talking about it, I realized that I didn’t hear the word work from me. After a while the student told me to go home after work. It was a complete misunderstanding. After I went home, I tried to contact my company. Then I realized my mistake. I was working from home. In the past, I used to be able to work in an office. I used to commute to work everyday, but the office atmosphere and the relationship I could make through conversation with coworkers disappeared. And now I’m working from home, I’m very relieved. After I became an introvert, I have been looking for someone who shares the same interest. This led me to get a job that does not require me to meet people everyday.   Now I’m always worried about how lonely I have to be, but if I didn’t go to the company, I would be much lonelier. That’s why it’s a good thing for me to work from home. Loneliness is a thing that I always have to be careful. At the same time, if I can overcome it, it will turn into a fun challenge that makes me feel good. I think what I should be afraid of is not the fear of being lonely but the fear of missing many good things at work.<n><n>### Assessment: Check if the responses were done following the instructions.<n><n>

Choices:  A: theater B: computer C: opera D: television E: concert<n><n>### Response:		A: the only time you find a paper program is when going to a theater. A lot of the arts and entertainment places use paper programs these days. But that's not much of what the multiple choice question asks. The only thing that this question asks is that it should relate to paper programs. The only people who use paper programs are when they go to the theater.<n><n>### Input<n>What are the steps of cooking steak and potatoes? Choices: 1. Preheat oven. 2. Clean and cut potatoes. 3. Set potatoes on the baking sheet.	4. Bake the potatoes for 45 minutes. 5. Cook the steak on medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes.<n>I: It is important to preheat the oven before you begin.<n>O: After cutting and seasoning the steak you are now ready to begin cooking.<n>N: Cook the steaks on medium-high heat.<n>G: Cook the potatoes for 30 minutes than add the peeled potatoes into the oven for 15 minutes.<n><n>### Example<n>Step 1: Clean the potatoes.<n>Step 2: Peel the potatoes.<n><n>Step 3: Chop the potatoes.<n>This step is not mentioned, but I would suggest that the step of chopping potatoes would take place at this time.<n><n>Step 4: Cook the potatoes 45 minutes.<n><n>Step 5: Cook the steak for 8-15 minutes.<n>This step can also include the step of the steak being placed in a frying pan on medium-high heat and being flipped over with tongs once or twice during the time the steak is cooking.<n><n>### Conclusion:<n>Paper programs are only used in the movie theater. When a movie is playing, after showing the trailers, they always have the theater usher pass out paper programs to the people in the theater. The multiple choice question does not say so anywhere, but a theater is the only place that you will find paper programs. The question is only asking where a paper program can be found - the only answer that relates to that is a theater. You might also find programs for plays, especially Broadway plays, but they are usually sold on

What is a multi-value dictionary?<n><n>multi-value dictionary is a data structure that allows users to store values that are similar for different entries into a single slot. A Python dictionary is a data structure for which keys are hashable, unordered, strings (or unicode). Each key-value pair in a multi-value dictionary is stored in an integer, and the value data types can be chosen manually as well as according to the rules of the multi-value dictionary.<n><n>## 2. What data types can be stored in a multi-value Python dictionary?<n><n>Although a Python multi-value dictionary allows the data type to be chosen as it stores data in an integer (according to the rules of a Python dictionary), but if you are only using Python dictionaries as associative arrays (i.e. just a key-value), you can use any of the available data types. For example, consider the following data type as the key-value of a multi-value dictionary: <n>```<n>    def createMultiValueDict():<n>        multivaluedict = {}<n>        multiDictKey1 = "string1"<n>        multiDictKey2 = "string2"<n>        multiDictValue1 = "Hello World!"<n>        multiDictValue2 = 44<n>        multiDictValue4 = set([1,2,3])<n>        multivaluedct[multiDictKey1] = multiDictValue1<n>        multivalueddict[multiDictKey1, [multiDictKey2, multiDictValue2]] = multiDictValue1, multiDictValue2<n>        multivaluedictionary[multiDictKey1][multiDictKey2] = multiDictValue2<n><n>        print(multivaluedict[multiDictKey1])<n>        print(multiDictKey1, multiDictValue1)<n>        print(multivalentdict[multiDictKey2,multiDictValue4])<n>        print(

Choices:  A: pudding B: get news C: strain D: answer E: though<n><n>### Response:		<n>Input: While reading the first sentence about recieving a letter, I thought of the word receive. I then thought of the word recieve. The sentence states "why might I read it?" I thought of words to describe a friend over seas. I thought of the word friend. "Why might I read it?" This question can be answered in a couple words because it is so vague. I would think, if I was the writer, to try and simplify the question to one or two words so that the answer wasn't ambiguous.<n><n>#### Expected Output:<n><n>Input: while reading the first sentence about receiving a letter, I thought<n>of the word receive. I, then, I thought of the words recieved.

In step two, I thought of the spelling in recieved. In step three, I thought about what recieved meant. The next step was to find a synonym for recieved. At this point, I was wondering if the writer was talking about one person, many people or the writer themselves. I then asked the question how, many, as I thought about the words person in the sentence. This is where it got confusing. I was given the option of asking a question or adding a number to the sentence. I chose to ask a question. At this point, the sentence was "why might I recieve a letter". I did not think of the words recieve or receive when reading this, so I knew the task would be different than before. To answer this question, I had to think of a synonym for recieve, and a synonym of the word "letter". At this point, I had to think about where we all might recieve a letter.

I have been there and I know what it is like. I have also seen the struggles that people have to go in order to live. There are many ways in which we can do this. There are different ways that we could do this. People could rent a private room, have their own room in their home, or rent a single room. When we rent a private room we are only renting one bed and not needing to share with anyone else. It is a small space. We are also not sharing any expenses. The single room is a better investment. It is a room that will be used by one person and not need to be shared. They are also able to rent it out when they are not using it. In order to save money you could live with another family member without renting a room at all. A single room rented by a single person costs money. This is true. A single room rental is a much better investing in because you will get double the savings. Single person rentals are more expensive than those that are shared with other people.<n><n>### Demo

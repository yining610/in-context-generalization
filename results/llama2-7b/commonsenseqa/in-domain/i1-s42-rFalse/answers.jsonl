{"text": "A car is more than just a vehicle it is a place of solace. Many people use their cars as a place to think work out, or even sleep. This is understandable considering that the car is usually an escape from the city. Many people who work in the countryside live in the city in order to get to work. Those people are then subject to the hustle and bustle which then is their normal day. However they use their car to escape. They go home, drive straight into the garage and leave the hustle at work where the do not have to deal with it. That car gives them peace and quiet. But this is not necessarily a bad thing. The only way a society can grow and become a little more sophisticated is to step into the unknown. This unknown, for many, is the city. It has all the comforts of home but yet so much more. When these people have a problem they can turn to their cars to fix them. This gives their job a much greater meaning because it allows people who take problems in the cars apart to not just earn money but to be able to have an impact to the city. In addition, a car gives someone a purpose. Whether it is getting up and driving to the store or getting in the car after a hard day of work, a person has a sense of pride and accomplishment because they have a car of their very own.\n\n### Screenshot:\n<img src=\"https://github.com/BrianMiller17/CS180-Project-1/blob/main/CS180/Project%201%20-%20Multiple%20Choice.PNG\" >\n\n### Source:\n10439_1542457483239.png\n29247292008809.png\n\n### Resources:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwJ1o-Hp3u9Q1UoT212bnp4xBd14R8f2pJkCxLW5GbY/edit?usp=sharing", "answer": "C: repair shop"}

{"text": "Answer: A: bad\n\nThere are several things you should look out for in this question if you get one. The first is that there is going to be a choice of three different sentences, which you can see in the example. The second is that you will see four \"answer\" choices, which should always have the right wording so it's easier to tell what answers are correct or incorrect. You'll also see the word \"Answer\" instead of a question mark, but that's another part of the question that makes things a bit easier when you are trying to determine what the answer might be.\n\nTo find the correct answer to a coding question, you should first review the sentence and make sure that the question you are asked asks for a complete sentence. If you're unsure about this, you can also go through the question again, but this time mark off every part of speech as you read it so you'll know what kind it needs to be. If the question asks for a sentence in the past, you want to write one in the past. If the question asks you to write something in the present tense, you need to write it in the present tense.\n\nAs you are reading the sentences, you should always take into account whether or not it's asking for something specific. For example, some of these questions will want you to provide an example. You'll know when you've found an example question because it will be asking for a specific example that you need to provide. Examples would include: what word does it end on? When did it happen? or any similar phrasing.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example I\n\n\"What do you think about people who drive expensive cars on the freeway, what does it mean, and are they entitled to drive like that?\"\n\nAnswer:\nA: I don't like seeing people drive around in such expensive cars on the freway.\nB: People who drive expensive cars on freeways are a symbol of greed.\nC: It doesn't mean nothing, people just want to show off I guess.\nD: I think that people deserve to drive what they want on the highway.\nE: People who drive expensive supercars on freeways are entitled to drive faster then you.\n\n### Example II\n\n\"What do they call people who enjoy being outside in the summertime?\"", "answer": "E: evil"}

How much total time did you take to complete the task? (Be specific and provide an estimate and a rationale)\n*Answer:The reading task actually felt like it took about 20-30 minutes to complete, because each of the choices and questions had some specific thought process needed to think about in some way. It could probably be done more quickly, but I wanted to do my best, and be a little careful, as I have only recently started to study for ACT and SAT and felt I was struggling a bit there until I took this practice test. So I wanted to do a bit better this time out of practice. I actually have less than 1 hour to complete it and didn't have time to read it carefully through each time (and had to read some of the questions more than once to make sure I understood each correctly because it was a little difficult to understand all at once exactly how and where I could even use this word, and I think most of the words are similar enough, that I thought about some other words first before thinking about this one.) \n\n 1. Did it feel like you had more or less time? Did the actual time taken to complete the task impact the quality of your response? \n* I think it did a tiny bit in that if I had more time, I might be able to consider other terms that were similar too, and I also might have used more specific language too.", "answer": "D: staying there"}

{"text": "I found this question a bit challenging, as I have little knowledge of scars. However, I believe that, based on the information learned through this course, the correct answer to this question is that \u2018figurative scars would never heal\u2019. I reached this conclusion by first understanding the definition of cut and then analyzing the sentence in question.\n\n\n### Instructions:\n\nAfter some thinking and research, you have developed 3 questions based on things people often consider (and often don\u2019t consider) when they enter a job role. Your questions relate to what you believe are the most common things people encounter when they start working in a new role. Which of the following questions are you correct in selecting for your new company? Choose three:  A: Has the job been outsourced? B: Will I have time to eat lunch? C: Will I need to learn a new computer program? D: How often will I need to work overtime due to work requirements? E: Where do I eat lunch?\n\n\n### Response\nI believe that the correct answers to these questions is:\n\n- Has the job been out-sources? I would choose this question because it is important for people to know that their job isn\u2019t going to be outsourced if they\u2019re going to spend more time trying to get there hours worked up.\n\n- Where do I eat luch. I would choose this question, since it is one of the most important things about a job, and if you are in a place where you have to choose where to eat lunch, then it\u2019s important that you have places to choose from that are acceptable options.\n\n- Will I need to learn new computer program? I would choose this answer because if someone doesn\u2019t know how to use one program on a computer, then how will they ever be able to use all of the other programs that may be available for them to use in an office or at home?", "answer": "D: heal"}

In all scenarios where the verb is \"learning\" or \"learned\", the \"verb+past tense\" combination is correct.

A: Learned/ed B: Improve yourself C: Become knowledgeable D: Have tools E: Persistence\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is A: Learned/Ed\n\n## AI-based Response:\nThe instruction above begins with the phrase with the present tense of the verb \"fantasized\" which is \"is fantasizing\" not \"is fantasizing/ed\".

{"text": "Choose the letter of the best answer.\n\n### Input\nI was afraid of being lonely while working abroad from home.  I was wrong. The reason is that it took a long time for me to be able to meet people around me. I don\u2019t think so much about whether you can work with people around you or what kind of lifestyle.   However, I was always afraid of doing something wrong and being lonely. I made a lot of effort not to get lost. One day, a very unexpected thing happened. I decided to be with foreign exchange students in a bar near the house as usual. A foreign student asked me about my job. When I started talking about it, I realized that I didn\u2019t hear the word work from me. After a while the student told me to go home after work. It was a complete misunderstanding. After I went home, I tried to contact my company. Then I realized my mistake. I was working from home. In the past, I used to be able to work in an office. I used to commute to work everyday, but the office atmosphere and the relationship I could make through conversation with coworkers disappeared. And now I\u2019m working from home, I\u2019m very relieved. After I became an introvert, I have been looking for someone who shares the same interest. This led me to get a job that does not require me to meet people everyday.   Now I\u2019m always worried about how lonely I have to be, but if I didn\u2019t go to the company, I would be much lonelier. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good thing for me to work from home. Loneliness is a thing that I always have to be careful. At the same time, if I can overcome it, it will turn into a fun challenge that makes me feel good. I think what I should be afraid of is not the fear of being lonely but the fear of missing many good things at work.\n\n### Assessment: Check if the responses were done following the instructions.", "answer": "B: arrest"}

{"text": "A: the only time you find a paper program is when going to a theater. A lot of the arts and entertainment places use paper programs these days. But that's not much of what the multiple choice question asks. The only thing that this question asks is that it should relate to paper programs. The only people who use paper programs are when they go to the theater.\n\n### Input\nWhat are the steps of cooking steak and potatoes? Choices: 1. Preheat oven. 2. Clean and cut potatoes. 3. Set potatoes on the baking sheet.\t4. Bake the potatoes for 45 minutes. 5. Cook the steak on medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes.\nI: It is important to preheat the oven before you begin.\nO: After cutting and seasoning the steak you are now ready to begin cooking.\nN: Cook the steaks on medium-high heat.\nG: Cook the potatoes for 30 minutes than add the peeled potatoes into the oven for 15 minutes.\n\n### Example\nStep 1: Clean the potatoes.\nStep 2: Peel the potatoes.\n\nStep 3: Chop the potatoes.\nThis step is not mentioned, but I would suggest that the step of chopping potatoes would take place at this time.\n\nStep 4: Cook the potatoes 45 minutes.\n\nStep 5: Cook the steak for 8-15 minutes.\nThis step can also include the step of the steak being placed in a frying pan on medium-high heat and being flipped over with tongs once or twice during the time the steak is cooking.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPaper programs are only used in the movie theater. When a movie is playing, after showing the trailers, they always have the theater usher pass out paper programs to the people in the theater. The multiple choice question does not say so anywhere, but a theater is the only place that you will find paper programs. The question is only asking where a paper program can be found - the only answer that relates to that is a theater. You might also find programs for plays, especially Broadway plays, but they are usually sold on", "answer": "C: opera"}

What is a multi-value dictionary?\n\nmulti-value dictionary is a data structure that allows users to store values that are similar for different entries into a single slot. A Python dictionary is a data structure for which keys are hashable, unordered, strings (or unicode). Each key-value pair in a multi-value dictionary is stored in an integer, and the value data types can be chosen manually as well as according to the rules of the multi-value dictionary.\n\n## 2. What data types can be stored in a multi-value Python dictionary?\n\nAlthough a Python multi-value dictionary allows the data type to be chosen as it stores data in an integer (according to the rules of a Python dictionary), but if you are only using Python dictionaries as associative arrays (i.e. just a key-value), you can use any of the available data types. For example, consider the following data type as the key-value of a multi-value dictionary: \n```\n    def createMultiValueDict():\n        multivaluedict = {}\n        multiDictKey1 = \"string1\"\n        multiDictKey2 = \"string2\"\n        multiDictValue1 = \"Hello World!\"\n        multiDictValue2 = 44\n        multiDictValue4 = set([1,2,3])\n        multivaluedct[multiDictKey1] = multiDictValue1\n        multivalueddict[multiDictKey1, [multiDictKey2, multiDictValue2]] = multiDictValue1, multiDictValue2\n        multivaluedictionary[multiDictKey1][multiDictKey2] = multiDictValue2\n\n        print(multivaluedict[multiDictKey1])\n        print(multiDictKey1, multiDictValue1)\n        print(multivalentdict[multiDictKey2,multiDictValue4])\n        print(", "answer": "C: medicine"}

It is a room that will be used by one person and not need to be shared. They are also able to rent it out when they are not using it.

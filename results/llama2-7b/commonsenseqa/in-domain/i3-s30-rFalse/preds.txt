Remember the "Crack-The-Code" Method? Answer: A letter stands for another letter or a number. Example "A" stands for "1" or "A" could also stand for "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "B", "G", or "H"... A letter or number is used in place of a number or letter the code is using. Example "4882" stands for the letters "EATS" or "The 4th, 8th, and 2nd letters in the word EAT"... (The word EAT, in this instance, would be "CASTLE"). "Crack-the question" method is a logical way to solve questions. Sometimes anagrams are used as well. Example "S" stands for "7". Sometimes words can have words within the word. Example - PHONETIC - Can you say the words ALPHA and COPY - phonetically.<n><n>```<n>   #include <iostream><n>    using namespace std;<n>    int main()<n>    { <n>        int x,y;<n>        cin>>x>>y;<n>        for(int i=1; i<=x; i++)<n>        {    <n>        for(int j=1; j<=y; j++)<n>        {        <n>        putchar(i+j);<n>        if(x==1||y==1)<n>        {  <n>        if(i!=j)<n>        {          <n>        if(i+j!=1)<n>        cout<<"A";<n>        else<n>        cout<<"B";<n>        }<n>        else<n>        if(i==j)<n>        {   if(x==1)<n>        cout>>"C";<n>        else<n>        <n>        if(y==1)<n>        <n>        cout>>"D";<n>        <n>        }<n>        }<n>        cin.ignore();<n>        }<n>        cout<<endl;<n>        }<n><n> <n><n><n>    return 0;<n>    }<n><n>```<n>![Sample](Sample.png)<n>[Solution](Solution.cpp)<n>

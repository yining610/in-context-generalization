Choices: A: got up and walked home B: got a concussion C: jumped out of the hole<n>Output: B: got a concusion<n><n>#### How we arrived here<n>First we used the if operator to set up a conditional statement if the person fell into the hole, we will perform the else statement. The if statement checks our conditions and if our conditions are true it will display the output (else statement).<n>This is an example of an if and else condition.<n><n>```<n>if statement:<n>  if personFell into hole == True :<n>     get concision()<n>else (else statement):<n>     get no concision()<n>```<n><n># Solution<n>In the example the scientist had the problem. But we need to start by asking our condition:<n>If we are learning mathematics, yes. We are trying to learn mathmatics. But in our example we want answers to the multiple choice question and in this we are already learning.<n>We can use the elif condition to perform an else statement which would allow if we feel good about ourselves we can run faster. And we can do this with a for loop.<n>The for loop allows us to test one variable in this we need to find what we need and test our variable for us this variable will simply be our question and we need to answer in 3 letters, therefore we need if..then.<n>In If the answer is true (1) then we are going to continue our for loop that is going through all 3 letters.<n>To do this we need to break out of our for loop by putting if our answer equals True.<n>We can have a elif condition (else if) that will allow us to check if we want to do math or not by asking if the person is not enlighted what to do else check our condition again.<n><n>After this we need to write a new

Choices: A: their seats B: the new team C: the game D: the players  E: the schedule<n>Output: C: the game<n><n>### Instruction:How many times you think the answer is E from the examples above?<n><n><n>### Instructions and example:<n><n>For question D we don't know the answer to B, C or E, but from E we can say they are related to a meeting, so we will pick A or C. The question asked for a single choice, so A is the answer.<n><n>For question D, you can't know from the examples that the question asked for "people on the screen". The announcer might be telling them about the schedule, about an event, about the hockey game etc. You can't know this from the data given.<n><n>You can't know for sure whether A or C is the best choice because the announcer might be telling you something else too, such as about the schedule. So you don't know if A or C is the one answer for the question. So the answer to question C can only be D or E. You won't know from D whether the announcer tells about "a new team" or about "the players". It was possible that he could have talked about "the schedule", so you won't know if C was the correct choice for question C from D. So you won't know the answer from this question. E is the only good answer for question C.<n><n>The only possibility for all questions of the last two, is that the announcer talked about something else than the team or the schedule.  And the one "good" possibility, is that he talked about the game. That was the "best" (but not "only") possibility. E should be the answer, if you need to guess one.<n><n>### Output<n><n>```javascript<n>{<n>  _id : 5f226ab03b4513d901241686,<n>  score : 3,<n>  correct : true,<n>  status : 1,<n>  created :<n>   {<n>    year : 2019,<n>

Choices:  A. headache B. mathematics C. microscope D. analysis E: better understanding<n>\end{code}<n><n>Answer: Please use `split()` method to extract the data between the delimiters.<n><n>Then, use [`list comprehension`](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) and [`zip()`](https://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/control/comprehensions/#using-zip-and-zip-with-in) method in [`apply()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.apply_along_axis.html) to convert the list to a dictionary where you can make a valid check for if the `in` statement is true or false.<n><n>Comment: please check this url "https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dict_comprehensions.asp" it should be in the list comprehension. I want to do this because I want to get a better understanding on python and I think this program won't be done with a for loop. I have done a while loop and it seemed to work but my professor says I cannot do it like that.<n><n>Comment: @Hunter I have provided the solution where you can use `list comprehension` to do the loop. Also please check the 2nd answer.<n><n>Comment: I understand but all of the instructions are in the program above. How would I make it so that it can convert to a dictionary.<n><n>Answer: The data is not really very well structured (e.g. "Better understanding" should be the correct answer to all possible input). Thus, an appropriate solution relies on some clever use of regular expressions.<n><n>Here is a naive (and slow) solution using `re` module and regular expressions. You can replace that with `list(re.findall(pat, str))` if you don't mind the extra loop.

It gives details about the type, and the name of variables that can be used in the function, return type, and which function's name it represents, with no code. Also, a function declaration is a set of declarations for a function.<n>We will write function declaration program using C++:<n><n>```<n><n>#include <iostream><n>using namespace std;<n><n>void findSum (int sum, int a,int b);<n>void findSum(int sum,int a,int b); //function declaration<n><n>int main()<n>{<n>    int a,b,c,sum=0;<n><n>    cout<<"Enter numbers"<<endl;<n>        <n>    cin>>a>>b>>c;<n><n><n><n><n><n>}<n><n>void findSum(<n><n>    int sum,<n><n>    int a,<n><n>    int b<n><n>)<n>{<n><n>    int x;<n><n>    x=a+b;<n><n>    sum=55;<n>}<n>```<n><n># 50  <n>## C program for function declaration<n>We can define multiple functions in a single function. For example, we can <n>define function to check if a number is even, and another function to check <n>if a number is odd.<n><n>Let us see how we declare functions in a single function- <n><n>```<n>//functional.c<n><n>#include<stdio.h><n><n>void main()<n>{   <n><n>    int a = 5;<n>   <n>    if(a%2==0)<n>        {<n>        printf("It is even");<n>        }<n>    else<n>        {<n>        if(a%2!=0)<n>            {<n>            printf("It is odd");<n>            }<n>        }<n>}<n>```<n>When we execute this program, the output will be-<n>```<n>It is even<n>```<n>In the code written above, we printed output. If we use functions, we will <n>be able to use the same code for other things, without repeating so much <n>code. Instead of writing so much code for doing this, we can use function <n>calls. For example, if we want to print the even numbers less than

A binary tree can be traversed in width-first or height-first order (or both). A linked list can be traversed in sequential order. One traversal algorithm is simple depth-first search; another more sophisticated algorithm is a Breadth-first search.<n><n>## Explanation: What you need to do is to ask specific questions to each node. This gives the possibility of more than one answer.<n><n>## Solution Method: In order to find the answer to the first question, you'll need to understand exactly how data structures and algorithms work in JavaScript. The following is a beginner's guide on how to traverse data structures without going overboard.<n><n>### What are Data Structures and Algorithms?<n><n>#### What is a Data Structure?<n><n>In the most basic sense, a data structure is a way of organizing data and making it accessible and efficient for a computer to manipulate, use in calculations, and update.<n><n>#### What are Algorithms?<n><n>An algorithm is basically a set of instructions for the computer to make something happen. For example, if you’re going to do a sum operation, the instructions will most likely be like this:<n><n>Start by choosing the number and multiply it by 2. Check to see

If the number 0 is input into the computer, it will output binary 0100 and if it is input with 1 it output binary 1010.

He says, \"That must mean, that the neuron, is made up of protein components that help it, to function.\" What is that, exactly, that the neuron must be made up of? Choices:  N: Amine  O: Amine Acid  P: Peptides  R: Proteins  S: Sawdust\n\n### Explanation A: The exact part of the neuron that helps it function, is amine acids of the proteins. Neuron must be made up or a protein compounds as this helps it function. Amine, or more formally amine acids, it one of the compounds that helps neuron function, and is what the scientist is referring to within this paragraph in the document. \n\n### Instuction:If an amine acid breaks down into its constituent amine subunits (amino groups, and carboxyl groups), then the result is a what? Choices: N: Acid substance C: Peptide bond P: Carboxylic acid S: Salt compound\nAn amine acid breaks down to release amine groups and carboxyl groups, which when released together, can form a carboxylic acid. This means that, a substance that has an excess of amine, will break down to release carboxyl groups. What happens next though, is that an amine can combine with a carboxylic, hence a", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

{"text": "It would be the most accurate to say he placed the cabbage:\n\n1. In the refrigerator, on the plate and in the freezer.\n\nIn order to determine from which of the response options, 'cabbage' is referred to, we assume that there is only one choice for 'cabbage' in an answer (as there is for 'do math' or 'enlightened'). Therefore, we must ask ourselves the following question - Which of the words listed above is used only once?\n\nAnswer: It would be the\n\n1. supermarket\n\nThis is because only 'cabbage' appears in'supermarket' and 'cabbage' can be inferred from'supermarket' if we assume, based on the answer options, that the speaker refers to the verb 'to place'. So, the cabbage would probably be placed somewhere within the supermarket, as the supermarket is often used when referring to a large grocery store. Therefore, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. The cabbage is in the freezer, which is located within the kitchen.\n\n2. The cabbage is on the shelf in the vegetable section of the supermarket.\n\nNow that we know roughly where the cabbage is placed, we can infer whether the scientist placed the cabbage within the supermarket, e.g. in the freezer, or outside, e.g. on a shelf in the vegetables section.\n\nWe can then answer the question by choosing either B (in the freezer) or A (on the supermarket shelf). Both are possible answers, and B is slightly more probable than A, because if the cabbage is in the supermarket, then it follows logically that it would be in the freezer. We infer that the cabbage is not near the sink, because the word sink (which can be inferred from the mention of a cabbage headache) is not mentioned in the answer options and would be unlikely to be the first choice made by the speaker. We also know that the cabbage is certainly not in the grocery store, because the grocery store is not a likely place for grocery items like cabbages to be stored.\n\n\n> #### 2.\n\n1.

It involved simply providing the right kind of input in the right format. \n\n\n#### First Steps:\n\nGiven that the answer to this question is \u201cE: better understanding\u201d, I needed to first determine what part of this answer I needed to focus on. This led me to take a step back and start the process of analysis and synthesis of the problem. For example, with questions that have similar answers, I found that the question might not have been correctly interpreted as the answer is quite broad. I will demonstrate this by analyzing the other answers given to this question so that we may have a better sense of what the task\u2019s answer may be.\n\n- What are the answers given in this multiple choice question?\n\n- **Option \u2018A:\u2019 What do we get if we remove \u2018the\u2019 from this question?**\n\n  My answer: \u2018Learn more about\u2019 is a bit of a confusing way to put it as there are many ways to learn more about something so I think the correct sentence would be \u2018do learn more about\u2019\n\n- **Option B: Is headache an unsuitable answer for this question?**\n \n  My answer: Yes, I would say so. I don\u2019t believe headache is a suitable answer for this question because I am unsure why the question asks what kind of analysis is done if it\u2019s about a scientist doing an analysis himself.\n\n- **Option C: Why is \u2018space shuttle\u2019 considered inappropriate as an answer?**\n\n  What I found is that space shuttle refers to a vehicle, and from the title of the question, it doesn\u2019t seem to refer to astronauts or other space ships but rather a lab results. So I concluded that space shuttle as an answer to the question is wrong because \u2018Space shuttle\u2019 refers to a vehicle so it doesn\u2019t make sense to include this word in the context of exploring space. \n\n- **Option D: Why is hoverboard an inappropriate answer choice?**\n\n  As far as I can tell, hoverboard is not what\u2019s being asked about in the problem thus I think hoverboard is an inappropriate choice.\n\n- **Lastly, why is E: better understanding correct as an answer", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

{"text": "What is a person likely feel after being abandoned by their former partner can be different according to many factors one can be they do not have friends close to them,another is that they don't have any money to get to their house, the question does not tell us exactly why someone may feel this because we were not given any information about the person and his friends, the other reasons that we get from the question is that he may feel abandoned because he may have lost his job that enabled him to buy the house,so he does not rent it because he does not have the money to pay for it, I think that some of the possible reasons that someone may feel like this is not the only one it's just some that I can think of maybe there is others.\n\n### Comments:\n- First, I'm worried that we're not going to receive enough specifics to write our answers.

I think it could be possible to answer correctly to the question, but the answer may contradict what was going to happen in the next question.\n\n## Reflection\nI found that this course is a little different from the last few ones we have taken but still we can use the previous ones when we think we need help. It's important to not give the exact answer but try to explain the best answer you can.\nThe one thing that surprised me in this course is how it can be different from some other online courses, it's better than some.I think it's better to talk about every question or information we need to get help from someone or try to solve it with the information we received. It also depends on what we have been given.\n\n### Constructive feedback for peers\n\n- In response to the second question, it's important to find the reason for why someone may feel the way they do\n- It's also important to give examples to strengthen the answer\n- To the last question it's equally important to do this, give examples as well as explain what they are\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion there are many benefits to learning with", "answer": "C: isolation"}

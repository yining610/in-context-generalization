Choices: A: feel bad about himself B: feel good about himself C: run faster D: get a ride E: quit running \nOutput: C: run faster\n\n#### Question:\nIn the example below what are we actually doing and why?\nInput: the person was walking home and all of a sudden he fell into a hole, he immediately what? Choices: A: got up and walked home B: got a concussion C: jumped out of the hole\nOutput: B: got a concusion\n\n#### How we arrived here\nFirst we used the if operator to set up a conditional statement if the person fell into the hole, we will perform the else statement. The if statement checks our conditions and if our conditions are true it will display the output (else statement).\nThis is an example of an if and else condition.\n\n```\nif statement:\n  if personFell into hole == True :\n     get concision()\nelse (else statement):\n     get no concision()\n```\n\n# Solution\nIn the example the scientist had the problem. But we need to start by asking our condition:\nIf we are learning mathematics, yes. We are trying to learn mathmatics. But in our example we want answers to the multiple choice question and in this we are already learning.\nWe can use the elif condition to perform an else statement which would allow if we feel good about ourselves we can run faster. And we can do this with a for loop.\nThe for loop allows us to test one variable in this we need to find what we need and test our variable for us this variable will simply be our question and we need to answer in 3 letters, therefore we need if..then.\nIn If the answer is true (1) then we are going to continue our for loop that is going through all 3 letters.\nTo do this we need to break out of our for loop by putting if our answer equals True.\nWe can have a elif condition (else if) that will allow us to check if we want to do math or not by asking if the person is not enlighted what to do else check our condition again.\n\nAfter this we need to write a new", "answer": "E: falling down"}

You won't know from D whether the announcer tells about \"a new team\" or about \"the players\".

I want to do this because I want to get a better understanding on python and I think this program won't be done with a for loop. I have done a while loop and it seemed to work but my professor says I cannot do it like that.\n\nComment: @Hunter I have provided the solution where you can use `list comprehension` to do the loop. Also please check the 2nd answer.\n\nComment: I understand but all of the instructions are in the program above. How would I make it so that it can convert to a dictionary.\n\nAnswer: The data is not really very well structured (e.g. \"Better understanding\" should be the correct answer to all possible input). Thus, an appropriate solution relies on some clever use of regular expressions.\n\nHere is a naive (and slow) solution using `re` module and regular expressions. You can replace that with `list(re.findall(pat, str))` if you don't mind the extra loop. Also, you can optimize it by using better expression to simplify the regexes.\n\n\\begin{code}\n>>> import re\n>>>\n... answer = {r'(?<=[answer the following", "answer": "A: georgia"}

It gives details about the type, and the name of variables that can be used in the function, return type, and which function's name it represents, with no code. Also, a function declaration is a set of declarations for a function.\nWe will write function declaration program using C++:\n\n```\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid findSum (int sum, int a,int b);\nvoid findSum(int sum,int a,int b); //function declaration\n\nint main()\n{\n    int a,b,c,sum=0;\n\n    cout<<\"Enter numbers\"<<endl;\n        \n    cin>>a>>b>>c;\n\n\n\n\n\n}\n\nvoid findSum(\n\n    int sum,\n\n    int a,\n\n    int b\n\n)\n{\n\n    int x;\n\n    x=a+b;\n\n    sum=55;\n}\n```\n\n# 50  \n## C program for function declaration\nWe can define multiple functions in a single function. For example, we can \ndefine function to check if a number is even, and another function to check \nif a number is odd.\n\nLet us see how we declare functions in a single function- \n\n```\n//functional.c\n\n#include<stdio.h>\n\nvoid main()\n{   \n\n    int a = 5;\n   \n    if(a%2==0)\n        {\n        printf(\"It is even\");\n        }\n    else\n        {\n        if(a%2!=0)\n            {\n            printf(\"It is odd\");\n            }\n        }\n}\n```\nWhen we execute this program, the output will be-\n```\nIt is even\n```\nIn the code written above, we printed output. If we use functions, we will \nbe able to use the same code for other things, without repeating so much \ncode. Instead of writing so much code for doing this, we can use function \ncalls. For example, if we want to print the even numbers less than", "answer": "C: city"}

A binary tree can be traversed in width-first or height-first order (or both). A linked list can be traversed in sequential order. One traversal algorithm is simple depth-first search; another more sophisticated algorithm is a Breadth-first search.\n\n## Explanation: What you need to do is to ask specific questions to each node. This gives the possibility of more than one answer.\n\n## Solution Method: In order to find the answer to the first question, you'll need to understand exactly how data structures and algorithms work in JavaScript. The following is a beginner's guide on how to traverse data structures without going overboard.\n\n### What are Data Structures and Algorithms?\n\n#### What is a Data Structure?\n\nIn the most basic sense, a data structure is a way of organizing data and making it accessible and efficient for a computer to manipulate, use in calculations, and update.\n\n#### What are Algorithms?\n\nAn algorithm is basically a set of instructions for the computer to make something happen. For example, if you\u2019re going to do a sum operation, the instructions will most likely be like this:\n\nStart by choosing the number and multiply it by 2.

After reading the rules and instructions, please go through them again after you make a mistake. Read them over and over.\n\nComputers are based on binary where there are two states, 0 and 1. If the number 0 is input into the computer, it will output binary 0100 and if it is input with 1 it output binary 1010. The computer can take two pieces of information and determine any number in binary or 11,10,11,01,01,10 etc. This is because all it knows about how to add is how to add 0s and 1s together.\n\nThe computer also understands the concept of \"if this, then that\"\n\nThe computer will read binary and tell you what value it is in binary.\n\nThe computer will only be as fast as the information you enter into it.\n\nThe computer is very good at taking binary and reading from right to left.\n\n##################################################\n\nInput:  A:0001 B:1101 C:1010 D:0010 E:0111\n\nOutput:E: 01\n\n######################################################\n\n#!/lib/python\n\ndef binarySearch():\n\n    if (len(input)) == 0:\n\n        return None\n    else:\n\n        min_ = input[0]\n        max_ = input[-1]\n\n        middle = int(len(input)//2)\n\n        if (middle == 0):\n\n            return binarySearch(input)\n\n        else:\n\n            if (min_ > input[middle]):\n\n                return binarySearch([input[0:middle], 1, input[middle+1:]])", "answer": "C: bar"}

The function must first check if the arguments are valid strings by confirming that if one of the arguments is the EMPTY STRING, the other argument is NOT EMPTY. If neither argument is EMPTY, the function then checks that the strings are sorted. If ALL strings are EMPTY the function should return \"Both are empty\". If both strings are not sorted, the function should return \"Strings are not sorted\". If only one of the strings is EMPTY, AND the other arguments is sorted, the function should then compare the empty string with each nonempty string and return \"The empty string is least\". If only one of arguments is sorted, and the other argument is not empty, the function should return that the sorted argument is \"Least\". Otherwise, if both arguments are sorted, the function will return the shortest string.\n\n\tfunction least(a,b) {\n\n\t}\n\n### Instructions:Code 2: You have to implement a function \"least2\" that takes as its arguments two Strings (empty string should be valid) and returns the smallest value of the two.

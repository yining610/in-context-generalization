The function will have to check against any provided rules (such as only capitals, only numbers, etc.)<n><n>The provided array 'dict' defines the rules. Note: The rules should have no ',' characters.<n>For instance, an array element in the dict may have a single value i.e., 'a0' or a 5 digit number like 'a12345'. This tells the function something.<n><n>As an example spelling a one word, using provided rules: Capital alphabets, only numbers, and periods with zeros are not allowed, Capital alphabets + numbers, and single spaces between letters are allowed<n><n>Output: There are 153 ways to write the word 'a0000'. This means we can separate 'a000' into two groups of two digits.<n>'00' can be one of the following: '0', '2', '4', '6', '8'. And for '000', the possible letters would be's', 't', 'w', 'v', 'x', 'y'.<n><n>Then, we would have 15 combinations of: 'as', 'at', 'aw', 'ax', 'ay', 'asw', 'ats', 'atsw', 'asx', 'atx', 'ays', 'atw', 'aty', 'asvt', 'atsv', 'aswv', 'atws', 'atsvw'.<n><n>This number would be 15/2 = 7.5.

These instructions typically are stored in the computer's nonvolatile memory called firmware. Firmware instructs the processor and allows a computer to read data from memory or storage devices, such as disk and tapes, enter and store data into memory or storage and send data to peripheral devices. The computer's software runs on the hardware and is the actual programs and instructions that a user interacts with. Software is created for users and for the computer in terms of how the computer reads or interprets the information.<n><n>**<n><n>Why Do Computers Misunderstand? What Does It Mean To Be Unintentionally Biased?<n>Computers have one particular problem, computers can't think. Computers can't learn. They can only follow the programs written for them. Even when the machine is given all of the correct input, it can't tell you when it thinks there is a problem or misunderstood the information. Therefore computers are unintentionally biased and misunderstands because they can't learn, think or interpret in the same human way.<n><n>**<n>How Do Algorithms & Data Sets Affect Computational Power?<n>Algorithms are used to organize and store data. This data is stored both on a hard drive as well as on a soft copy. Soft copy storage also referred to as the cloud stores data in an electronic file or virtual storage system that may be operated from afar. Most data is also stored online in soft copy. This

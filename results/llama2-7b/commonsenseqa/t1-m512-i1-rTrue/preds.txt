Choices:  A: yard B: basement C: kitchen D: living room E: garden<n><n>### Response:		His favorite room in the house was the living room.<n>The question starts by telling us what attracted an individual to a room. And then explains that it is his favorite room in the house as well. We see this is the living room because the answers in this section all focus on what makes the room attractive to the individual (yards and kitchens mainly focus on growing foods and having nice views). The only choice that doesn't fit this criteria is living room itself.<n>We are told that it's his favorite. This means that it isn't a place he looks forward to revisiting, such as a garden, but it's a place he would always find attractive. This eliminates all answers except for garden.<n>Finally, there is a specific mention to having a nice view, so garden is the correct choice.<n>Option B: basement: This is not the favorite room. It isn't the one the individual went to, and it doesn't have the benefits of a nice view.<n><n>Option D: living room: This is the one the individual visited, which would indicate that it's his/her favorite room.<n><n>Option E: garden: This doesn't fit with the criteria. It doesn't have the nice view mentioned as an advantage to the living room.<n><n>Option A: yard: This doesn't mention anything about benefits, or where the individual visits. Therefore it doesn't fit with what we are told.<n><n>Option C: kitchen: This doesn't match what was described for a favorite room. It also doesn't have a nice view.<n>

Choices:  A: united states B: mexico C: countryside D: atlas E: oceans<n><n>### Response:		2. By process of elimination, I found the correct answer as option C (the countryside).<n>The United States, Mexico, Mexico City, the oceans, and the atlas are all false possibilities. Because of the GPS, people are less concerned with getting lost and relying on landmarks that they are familiar with, such as the ocean, Mexico, or the United States. This indicates that they are unlikely to use a paper atlas while driving. Furthermore, in this day and age, it is expected that a GPS device or a smartphone will always be on hand. In light of this information, there is obviously insufficient reason to suggest that a paper atlas will be utilized.<n><n>### Input-Demand Rationales<n><n>1. The question is directed at Google Maps. People do not refer to paper atlases when they utilize Google Maps. Hence, this option does not apply. Because a human atlas is unlikely to have geographical information in all regions of the world, option A (the Unites States) is unlikely to be correct. Option B (Mexico City) is not likely to be correct since the question is about a GPS app, and the question stipulates this. The oceans are unlikely to be mentioned since they lack geographical information that a GPS app has (option E). GPSes, including Google Maps, are used to get around and are not focused on things that can only be done at sea (option D). Hence, option D is not the most appropriate response.<n><n>### Output<n><n>### Input<n><n>### Response

There is a definite contrast between the coach and the leftovers, which is why this is correct. By process of elimination, we can rule out alternatives such as carpet, fridge, breadbox and refrigerator.<n><n>### Note: The words "back" and "of" make it clear that B is talking about a literal coach with two wheels attached to an external means of moving people/objects.

It would be most likely to follow the underlined phrase and have an effect on a team's success, rather than the other way around. In context, the entire sentence is trying to show that people are good at something. However, the underlined phrase is telling us that the person was good at creating chaos. Therefore, A: Creating Chaos is the correct choice.  Answer: A: Creating Chaos<n><n><n>### Explanation:  When we use "to the extent," it indicates that we have not yet arrived at the end of an idea. The phrase "he was a master at creating chaos" comes before the sentence's end. We know that A: is the correct phrase by process of elimination.<n>The other choices would either make no sense or appear in the wrong place.<n>

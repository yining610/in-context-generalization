{"text": "2. By process of elimination, I found the correct answer as option C (the countryside).\nThe United States, Mexico, Mexico City, the oceans, and the atlas are all false possibilities. Because of the GPS, people are less concerned with getting lost and relying on landmarks that they are familiar with, such as the ocean, Mexico, or the United States. This indicates that they are unlikely to use a paper atlas while driving. Furthermore, in this day and age, it is expected that a GPS device or a smartphone will always be on hand. In light of this information, there is obviously insufficient reason to suggest that a paper atlas will be utilized.\n\n### Input-Demand Rationales\n\n1. The question is directed at Google Maps. People do not refer to paper atlases when they utilize Google Maps. Hence, this option does not apply. Because a human atlas is unlikely to have geographical information in all regions of the world, option A (the Unites States) is unlikely to be correct. Option B (Mexico City) is not likely to be correct since the question is about a GPS app, and the question stipulates this. The oceans are unlikely to be mentioned since they lack geographical information that a GPS app has (option E). GPSes, including Google Maps, are used to get around and are not focused on things that can only be done at sea (option D). Hence, option D is not the most appropriate response.\n\n### Output-Acceptance Rationales\n\nThe correct response was C. The GPS system can guide you through the countryside in addition to guiding you across large cities and across the United States. As a result, this possibility satisfies the demands (and does not violate the logical conditions or lead to the desired result).\n\n### Response Rationale\nThe correct answer is C (the countrymap) because Google Maps and other GPS systems can help people navigate both urban and rural road systems.", "answer": "D: atlas"}
{"text": "A carpet is not a suitable place to store leftovers. Nor are a refrigerator, breadbox or fridge. Instead, the leftovers had gone to the back of a coach.\n```\n\n### Rationale: The option most specific to the content and intent of the text is A: Coach. There is a definite contrast between the coach and the leftovers, which is why this is correct. By process of elimination, we can rule out alternatives such as carpet, fridge, breadbox and refrigerator.\n\n### Note: The words \"back\" and \"of\" make it clear that B is talking about a literal coach with two wheels attached to an external means of moving people/objects. It may be either a horse-drawn carriage or a minivan.\n\n\n### Instructions:Which of the following best describes the intended meaning of the underlined phrase in the following sentence?\n\n### Demo: Input: On the other end of the spectrum, he was a master at creating what when asked.\n\n### Response/Choice: What is \"creating chaos\"? It would be most likely to follow the underlined phrase and have an effect on a team's success, rather than the other way around. In context, the entire sentence is trying to show that people are good at something. However, the underlined phrase is telling us that the person was good at creating chaos. Therefore, A: Creating Chaos is the correct choice.  Answer: A: Creating Chaos\n\n\n### Explanation:  When we use \"to the extent,\" it indicates that we have not yet arrived at the end of an idea. The phrase \"he was a master at creating chaos\" comes from the sentence \"he was a master _to the extent_ that he could create chaos.\" He was good at creating chaotic situations. This is what the sentence and the phrase \"creating chaos\" are trying to tell us.\n\n### Example: 1. The statement \"they hire only employees who are reliable\" is not quite true. Many of the company's \"employees\" are actually interns and freelance contract workers, who will never be allowed to continue working in that particular branch of the company. The sentence does not refer to all employees, so it's not accurate to say that _only", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

Choices: A) Negative and positive  B) New and old  C) Old and new  D) Not new or old E) Both positive and negative\n\n### ResponseBoth positive and negative.\n\n### Input(cont.):The problem with new technologies is that they're often expensive. This can make them unavailable to those who don't have money to spare, which can create a divide between those who can and can't afford them. However, new technologies can also improve the quality of life and create opportunities for people who otherwise wouldn't have access to them.\n\n### Question:How do new technologies create new jobs for those who don't need advanced education?\n\n### ResponseWhen new technologies are released they make old jobs obsolete. This creates a demand for new jobs like customer support, IT tech, and computer technicians, which require less education than some other jobs in existence.\n\n### Task:What is a negative way the new technology can be used to hurt society?\n\n### Positive\n\n### ResponseThe new technology can be used in a negative way by those looking to exploit vulnerable people who are willing to pay money for what is often known as dating scams.\n\n### Negative\n\n### ResponsePeople can also be lured into new technologies that are designed to take advantage of them like dating sites that trick people into giving out their real name and personal information.\n\n### Additional Comments:This person will probably go on to work with technology.\n\n### How to do the task:1.

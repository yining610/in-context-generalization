{"text": "His favorite room in the house was the living room.\nThe question starts by telling us what attracted an individual to a room. And then explains that it is his favorite room in the house as well. We see this is the living room because the answers in this section all focus on what makes the room attractive to the individual (yards and kitchens mainly focus on growing foods and having nice views). The only choice that doesn't fit this criteria is living room itself.\nWe are told that it's his favorite. This means that it isn't a place he looks forward to revisiting, such as a garden, but it's a place he would always find attractive. This eliminates all answers except for garden.\nFinally, there is a specific mention to having a nice view, so garden is the correct choice.\nOption B: basement: This is not the favorite room. It isn't the one the individual went to, and it doesn't have the benefits of a nice view.\n\nOption D: living room: This is the one the individual visited, which would indicate that it's his/her favorite room.\n\nOption E: garden: This doesn't fit with the criteria. It doesn't have the nice view mentioned as an advantage to the living room.\n\nOption A: yard: This doesn't mention anything about benefits, or where the individual visits. Therefore it doesn't fit with what we are told.\n\nOption C: kitchen: This doesn't match what was described for a favorite room. It also doesn't have a nice view."}

{"text": "2. By process of elimination, I found the correct answer as option C (the countryside).\nThe United States, Mexico, Mexico City, the oceans, and the atlas are all false possibilities. Because of the GPS, people are less concerned with getting lost and relying on landmarks that they are familiar with, such as the ocean, Mexico, or the United States. This indicates that they are unlikely to use a paper atlas while driving. Furthermore, in this day and age, it is expected that a GPS device or a smartphone will always be on hand. In light of this information, there is obviously insufficient reason to suggest that a paper atlas will be utilized.\n\n### Input-Demand Rationales\n\n1. The question is directed at Google Maps. People do not refer to paper atlases when they utilize Google Maps. Hence, this option does not apply. Because a human atlas is unlikely to have geographical information in all regions of the world, option A (the Unites States) is unlikely to be correct. Option B (Mexico City) is not likely to be correct since the question is about a GPS app, and the question stipulates this. The oceans are unlikely to be mentioned since they lack geographical information that a GPS app has (option E). GPSes, including Google Maps, are used to get around and are not focused on things that can only be done at sea (option D). Hence, option D is not the most appropriate response.\n\n### Output\n\n### Input\n\n### Response"}
{"text": "A carpet is not a suitable place to store leftovers. Nor are a refrigerator, breadbox or fridge. Instead, the leftovers had gone to the back of a coach.\n```\n\n### Rationale: The option most specific to the content and intent of the text is A: Coach. There is a definite contrast between the coach and the leftovers, which is why this is correct. By process of elimination, we can rule out alternatives such as carpet, fridge, breadbox and refrigerator.\n\n### Note: The words \"back\" and \"of\" make it clear that B is talking about a literal coach with two wheels attached to an external means of moving people/objects. It may be either a horse-drawn carriage or a minivan.\n\n\n### Instructions:Which of the following best describes the intended meaning of the underlined phrase in the following sentence?\n\n### Demo: Input: On the other end of the spectrum, he was a master at creating what when asked.\n\n### Response/Choice: What is \"creating chaos\"? It would be most likely to follow the underlined phrase and have an effect on a team's success, rather than the other way around. In context, the entire sentence is trying to show that people are good at something. However, the underlined phrase is telling us that the person was good at creating chaos. Therefore, A: Creating Chaos is the correct choice.  Answer: A: Creating Chaos\n\n\n### Explanation:  When we use \"to the extent,\" it indicates that we have not yet arrived at the end of an idea. The phrase \"he was a master at creating chaos\" comes before the sentence's end. We know that A: is the correct phrase by process of elimination.\nThe other choices would either make no sense or appear in the wrong place."}

The answer then concludes that the female demand for shoes was greater than the male demand. \n\nThe shopping experience is very different from one woman to the next. Women may spend up to 10 per cent of their income on fashion. Shoe shopping tends to be a very social event. As a result, sales for women tend to be more frequent than those for men. \n\nAlso, women tend to be more interested in trendy footwear. In a typical shopping trip, women are more likely than men to spend a greater part of their time looking for items that match their wardrobe needs and mood. \n\nAdditionally, women have a strong need to socialize, but women also shop for entertainment and as a stress reliever.

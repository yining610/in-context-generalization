If no employee in the\narray has the given name, it will return -1.\n\n\nComplexity\n------\n\nThe loop can iterate up to boss_of_max employees; however, \nthe function will never encounter more than the last employee\nby virtue of the fact that the employee's name is null-terminated.\nThus, the loop body only needs to look at the names terminated\nby null.  The null terminators at the end can be examined\nin constant time, and each name comparison takes 1 scan+2 comparisons,\nfor a total complexity of a max of O(n) on the number of employees.\n\nIf the number of employees grows, the complexity will remain\na max of O(n), and if the function is called with n-1 employees,\nit is still O(n).\n\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThe call to strcmp will always be on the same buffer used to\npass user, and never be required to allocate memory.\n\n```\n\n### Discussion:\nCan you explain how the function works (desk checking/example)\n\n### Discusion:\n```text\n\nIn this section you are to implement the algorithm in C or C++.

{"text": "If 20 gallons is needed for heavy loads and 10 gallons is needed per medium load, I would assume that the average load is medium, which is 10 gallons. If so, a load that is medium has the same amount of water as a medium load. Using a load that is medium, I would use the equation of 10 gallons to do heavy loads. If I double it then I would multiply it by 10. The equation would look like this: 20 gallons.10 gallons,10 gallons.14 gallons.Multiplying by 25 gallons instead of 10 gallon to find the actual gallons is how you would figure the gallons in a regular load.So if the solution is 20 gallons, then I would multiply 20 gallons by 25 gallon.This would be:1000 gallons in round numbers.This means in round numbers we would need 9000 gallons and change.The answer is 9000.\n\n\n\n### Input-What would one consider a \u201ccarnival\u201d?

I have no proof that my program is accurate, but can you check it without looking at my sample data?\nMy algorithm works by dividing the number of gallons to the quarts and then multiplying the quarts by $50. The results is added up to get the total amount spent on champagne.\n\nMy program is:\n\n```r\ndef spendMoney = (bottles, price, discount)=> {\n    #The bottles must be at least 1 and the price the same\n\n    #We use discount since there is a volume discount, but only if the volume(gallon) is at least one.\n    if(bottles >= 1 ){\n        total = bottles * price\n        return ( (price - (price * discount/100)) ) * total\n    } else {\n        #We only return true if the quantity is less than 1.\n        return false\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI also tried using the `if` statement, but it wouldn't work. For example:\n\n```r if (bottles < 1 = false)\n```\nIt wouldn't let me call the method or give an error, even though I included `=  `between the equal sign and the else statement and `else: false` with the if statement after the less than 1 statement.\n\n**Sample Data:**\n\n```r\n> gallons = 25\n> price = 15\n> discount = 20\n> bottles = 10\n \n  True\n```", "answer": " 6400"}

{"text": "The answer is 40 \n\n### Explanation:72 crackers divided by 6, because each box is six sleeves, there are 300 crackers overall. This results in 30 crackers for each sleeve and 28 crackers per sleeve would result in 96 crackers per box. Divide this 96 by six to get 16 sleeves in each box. Five boxes of crackers would result in 80 sleeves of crackers. Lastly, multiply 300 by 80 to get how many sleeves are crackers in total. The answer is 24,000. Now divide the 24,072 by 28 to get how many sleves are crackers. The answer is 853. Finally, divide the 853 sleeves by 72 to get how many nights it would take. The answer is 11.67", "answer": " 56"}
{"text": "The amount left is $2.50.\n\n### Input\n#### A number is a set of digits that have been given as an answer. If the number was larger than 9, you would have to add the next set of numbers of digits. The number is 36 digits long. A computer counts in binary, which is a base 2 numerical representation. Binary represents numbers 1 through 16, and then all the rest are represented in hexadecimal. Binary counting is the most common counting method. Since binary is in base 2, we use \"2\" or \"0\" (for decimal) to be placed at the end of every number. Let's go through an example. We have the hexadecimal representation for the number in binary. We would then read 1, 2, 2, 92, ____, 113, 4_8, 2___ (0) 10011000,1 01111 (hexadecimal representation). We read the leftmost number, and then fill in to represent the rest. We say, \u201cI am going with 0\u201d. Next, we look to the left and read a new digit after the previous number. We read as zero as the answer, since that is the most recent number. So, we say, \u201cI am counting the first digit, and it is zero.\u201d Then we look to the left again and read a new digit of the number after the previous digit. From this, we can conclude that the second digit is 1, so the answer is 0 0 0 1. We repeat the process by reading one digit at a time. After the number is read, we count up, and find the leftmost digit, reading \u201c0\u201d. For the next digit, we read 1, then 0, then 0. The number we keep adding to becomes larger and larger. So, after we have gone through enough digits and our digit is large enough to not have to keep adding to it, the number is \u201clarge\u201d and \u201ccomplete\u201d.", "answer": " 5"}

In order to do this, the function requires an argument that counts all the vegan meals the person will receive (starting at 0 and ending at the provided argument).

Then, the function needs to be able to determine if the person has enough vegan or kosser meals available to give them a meal.

How much food does she buy more then she needs if she has enough drinks for 30 more people than she needed?\n\n###Response:20 more people\n\n#### Explanation: The part that has not been used for the party should be divided by 13, since the party has 130 guests and the food amount is 60 so its 60 / 13. So food will remain 60 / 2 =30 and party have 130 guests so the drink is (265 / 13) + (265 /9 +60) = 230, so food have surplus 30 which drinks have 10 more then needed and 30 guests.

So, we take the numerator as 6/12, or 600 /365 = 25/12 = 2/3 as the total number of months.\n\nNext, the fraction part of the question is: what fraction of 2/3 of the workers earn $75K. This question was about the fraction of people. Thus, the total workers are 365. So, when we divide the fraction over the total, 365, that leaves us with the denominator of 365/12 =25/12 of the workers, or 2/3 of all workers working at the factory.\n\n### Response The fraction of the workers is 1/2\n\n### Solution:\n\nWe can write the fraction \"what fraction\", as 1/2 (1/2 of 2/3 )\n\n1) What is the numerator of \"what fraction\"? \"What fraction\" means what fraction the total workers. \"What fraction\" is 600 / 365 which is 0.17 or 17%.\n\n2) What is denominator of what fraction\"? The denominator of 150 is 150/ 365 which gives us a denominator of 1/2.\n\nThus, \"what fraction\" = (1/2) (divide fractions)\n\nHence, 1 / 2 of all workers at the factory earn more than $ 75K per year.", "answer": " 253"}

{"text": "The discount in the given question is 15%. So total amount needed to purchase the item would be $325 =$ (500 * X)/100.\nNow, we will need to substitute the value of X here in given question.\nHence, $325 = $500*X/100.\nTo get X, we need to take $500 divided by 75 = $6.66 (15th of $500)\nSo, $X= 6.66\nHouse total amount to be added = $325+6.66(amount discount)\nHence, total amount = $325 + $6.66\n\nTotal amount needed = $325.66\n\nSo correct answer is $325.70.\n\n\n### Input : Mr. and Mrs. Smith are going to pay for their trip to the Bahamas together. In total, they are going to need four-fifths the price of their trip. Mr. Smith contributed $114 to their trip and Mrs. Smith contributed $146.

Total cost for Mrs. = $146, discount = 15%, Hence 146*(15/100) = $108.\nHence total cost for Mr. Smith = $114 +$108 = $222.\n\nTotal cost for both Mr. and Mrs. smith = $222 + 222 = $444\n\nSo, total amount required to pay for their vacation = $409 - 444\n\nHence, amount required to pay = $200.", "answer": " 95"}

There are zero vampires and not 900 or any value in between.\n\n### Justification for response:\n\nAssuming there is no cure for turning people into vampires and that vampires reproduce by turning people into vampire the only way for the game to end is for 100% of inhabitants die and be turned into zombies there after if someone is turned into a vampire they are now dead so when no more people are turned into vampires the game is over since no one is turned into a vamprie after that.\n\n### Alternate response:\n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question, however the best guess and most likely outcome is that there are no vampires and that the vampires are dead. This is supported by the fact that once a person has been turned into a vampirie, they are most likely dead and therefore not a vampire anymore (there is a high probability of this, because in the human body, life does not continue after death).  If a person is not dead, they may still be considered a vampire.\nThis is unsupported by the fact that if someone is alive and has not been turned into a vampre, they continue to live (a human body does not stop functioning, even if it is dead).\nAnother alternate response is to say that there is a chance that there is nothing, as there is no way of telling if this is true or false.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nSurely there is no definitive answer that cannot be disputed.\n\n### Assessment:\n\nI believe my response is correct as it is most likely the correct outcome of this scenario.", "answer": " 72"}

She collected a total of 55 coins(more than 45 coins)in the first three hours.\n2) Let the total number of coins for the first four hours (A, +B, +C...) be X. This also means X=4 (the total number of hours) +4(the number of coins)\n3) There are 15 more coined every hour  so (A+4+4)+A=15(if u take a minute to think abt this it's pretty straightfoward)\n4) So A+4=B. 5) and B+4=C.\n\nSo the total number of coind after the last hour is AC\n\n### Tips:\n\n5: \n- Add (A=X+4, B=X+9, C=X+14)\n- Then multiply the numbers (XxXxX) to get A C the answer is AXC", "answer": " 120"}

So think 2 or 6 in the first digit after the.9 and 0 or 3 in the second and 4 or 8 for the third, so 268 cents and 0.9 cents as the number of whole dollars, the 9 in the 268 as that number 3 would be 300, and 300 is 3 less than 303, and it's like 4 in the 260, but the last place I'm a bit confused, and I'll try out a few more, but those are the only ones I noticed right away, and none of them are right.

They said they were \"salesmen\" and that they were selling something to the man who lived in the house. David asked, how a \"salesperson\" could sell something if he or she couldn't see what it was? As David said this, he reached his hand into a pocket, grabbed something out and held it in front of his face. In a startled and outraged voice, one of the women screamed, \"What are you doing! Take that thing away from your face! It smells awful!\". David said, but can't you just smell it? The woman, obviously perturbed, replied, \"Smell it? I can't smell anything, I'm blind!\".

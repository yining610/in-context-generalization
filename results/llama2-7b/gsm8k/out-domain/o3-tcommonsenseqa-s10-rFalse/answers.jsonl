However, the following helped me\n\nI figured out the formula for each type of question.  By combining these equations, I get the solution for each problem.\n\n1. For part A, I get\n\n25% + 30% = 4 * 25% + 1000\n\nUsing this as a starting point, what we need to do is come up with a starting condition.\n\nFor the question of 'How many vegetables?'\n\nThere are 5000 vegetables, so we can say x = 5000\n\nTherefore:  5000 = 4 * x\n\nTherefore X = 4 x 5000/4 = 500\n\nThus we get 500 vegetables.\n\n2. For part B, I get 11,7 / 2\n\nI'm guessing that the denominator is the time\n\nTherefore I set:  20 min + 15 min = x\n\nTherefore we have 35 min or 1/3 hour\n\nTherefore we get 1 hour / 3\n\n3.

It has a main gate and 3 different kinds of fence. Fences A and B are a double-sided chain fence, a total of 8 feet long and each with their respective doors. C is a solid fence that is ten feet long, as well as a four-foot fence. E is also a double-sided fence, but it has a single door on it, and it is 30 feet long. F is 10 feet long, and it has a two-foot fence.\nAnswer:The total number of feet in all the fences together is 94 feet. There are 8 feet in 1 fence, as one foot measures a foot. There are 8 fences and each fence has a 10 foot fence and a total of 4 doors. Therefore, the number of doors in the fences equals 8. The fence which needs to be counted is 8 feet, which includes the two-foot fence and a gate that is 10 feet.\nWhen multiplying, the denominators have to be the same, which is the 10-foot fence. The total number of feet in the 8 fences totals 94 feet. But how many fences has 8 feet? There is 8, not to be confused with 8, which is not the same as 8 feet since it is in feet. The number of fences that are 8 feet long is 4, as there are 3 fences that are 10 feet long", "answer": " 121"}

Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the unique concept of significant whitespace. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming. Python is an interpreted, high-level, and general-purpose programming[7] language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code simplicity, and consequently, it is easy to learn.\n\nPython is often compared to Perl and Ruby. Like those languages, Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.

You need two variables to create this game for yourself. These two variables are s, and i.\n\n# s is the line of text. You want to split up s into a list. The first element of this list is the first word in the sentence and the second element is the last word in the sentence. You need to put that first word into i. You can do that with s[0].\n\n# However, you need to check whether the last element of that sentence list is '' (empty string). That will let you know that your sentence has at least two words. If the last word is not '' empty string, it may have more than one word.\n\n# Then, you need to find the second word that is in the sentence list. Find this second word by subtracting one from the i variable. Use i - 1. You can do that just by subtracting 1 from i. Here is the line that does that.\ns[-1]. You'll be able to do those two things and end by printing out either s[0]. + s[-1] which will print a single word line and s[0] which will print that line without the second word.\n\n# Input: If they say, \"What's your favorite food?  \", and a customer answers, \"chocolate\", and the cashier replies with, \"I don't know this one.  \", this is not a bad thing for the customer.

{"text": "1..the question asks for the total time spent biking each week, considering Tim\u2019s weekly commute to work, his weekend bike ride, and the distance of both journeys.\n2. Tim rides his bike to and from his workplace on each of the 5 workdays of the week, while his weekend bike journey is for recreation or training. Therefore, each of his daily trips to and from work takes approximately 1 hour.\n3. He also goes for a bike ride of 100 miles each Saturday. His weekend bike ride typically takes about 8 hours.\n4. Thus, if Tim can bike at a speed of 25 mph, he spends approximately 2 hours and 10 minutes biking to and from work each week.  It is possible that he goes at different speeds for his work and weekend biking journeys. In this case, however, we will assume that he bikes at the same speed during both journeys. \n5. Furthermore, Tim\u2019s daily weekday commute is 20 miles, while his weekend long-distance ride is 200 miles, which, at a speed of 40 mph, takes approximately 4 hours.\n6. However, as per the question, we will consider Tim\u2019s work-week biking time to be about 4 hours and 100 miles. This is because the work trips are shorter in duration, which implies that he can cover more distance per minute.\n7. Therefore, calculating the total time it takes him to commute to and from work during the week is 16 hours.  Since he also goes on a long-distance bike ride every Saturday, this accounts for approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes of his weekly biking time. Overall, his weekly bikin time is 17 hours and 10 mins.\n8. In this case, we can say that Tim spends a total of 17 hours and about 30 minutes biking each week.\nSo the final time is 17 hrs and 30 mins\n\nInput:It is very easy for one to believe in one thing or another thing without any evidence.

The options imply that the action \"change flooring material\" would not happen, but that's not what's being requested.\n3. Option A: change floor covering is not possible, but the correct answer is choice D: scrape floor.\n4. The phrase \"the floor covering\" suggests that the action is related to the floor itself, so we can eliminate A: change floor covering.\n5.

The questions begin with the statement that a bag contains blue and red.\n\n1. We are required to calculate the probability that the first ball picked out from the bag is blue.\n2. One way to do this is to think in terms of the sample space: the set of all possible outcomes of the event, in this case, the question.\n3. The sample space consists of the possibilities for the first ball drawn in this event. There are two different possibilities for the first ball: either it is red or it is blue. Since we are looking for the probability of this event, we must count how many ways we can", "answer": " 54"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking about how much more John's cow is worth after it gains 1.5 times the starting weight.  \n2) First, we compute how much the cow weigh before and at the end of the transformation.\n\n3) According to the question, the original weight(starting weight) is equal to 400 pounds and the new weight is 1.5 times more than 400 pounds, which equates to 600 pounds of weight. \n\n4) Now, to obtain the final value, John can multiply his starting weight by 1.5 and subtract it from his initial cost to determine the total profit attained. In this case, we substitute the starting weight as 400 and total cost as 3. We obtain the difference: 100 x 1.5 = 150 - 3 = 147.  \n5) Hence, the final cost is $147.00 and we've determined that the cow's final weight is 600 pounds. \n\nInput: 67.5 is what % less than 557.5?

There are two ways to do so, either by using the word formula, P * (100 %) / 100% or by dividing the price and multiplying it with 100, which is 557 * 100 / 100. Now, we compute the % change in the given value. \n17) Given the options, A: 20%: 19) For this particular % change, 20 is too high so the answer is D: 45%\n\nInput: 127.5 is what percent more than 111.5?

{"text": "Sentence is the lengthiest part of this equation. Sentences, as you might expect, equate to words: 3 words = 1 sentence. To make this easier, lets first convert time to minutes: \"1 minute\" becomes 60 seconds = 1 minute. 60 seconds a minute is 1 minute a minute, and that becomes \"1 minute equals 1 minute\". This means we have to multiply 1 minute times \"6 minutes per minute\" to get 66 minutes, and now we just subtract that from our total \"536 sentences\".

{"text": "1.$100$2\nAnswer: 1. We have the following information provided in the question: \n\u2022 Janet filmed a new 640-minute long movie \n\u2022 Janet\u2019s previous film had 120 minutes of filming \n\u2022 Janet spent $50 per minute filming her previous film \n\u2022 Janet's newest film is twice as expensive per minute to film as Janet's previous film \n\n2. We can use these constraints to set up a two-variable system (cost/minute and hour) of linear equations: costper minute = 50 x hour + costper minute = 100 x hour + 2costper minute costper minute = 2hour\n3. So we can say, cost = costper minute*hour, and replace that in the two given equations since they both have hour, we get, 0.5hour + 100hour + 2 = 2hour 0.5 + 100 + 2 = 102 So hour = 20 4. By solving these two equations, we get that the runtime of the film is 20 minutes; the hour in this case refers to minutes. 5. Next, we need to multiply the runtime, 20, by the cost per minute rate of $50 to get the total cost. Thus, the total cost was $1000. 6. Hence, the total answer is 1000.\nSo the final solution is 100$2", "answer": " 1920"}

{"text": "The question is asking the speed at which Conner can travel. \n\n2. The question asks for the average speed in miles per day if Conner rides his buggy on flat sand, uphill sloping and downhill slopes.\n\n3. The best way to solve this question is to first determine the ratios of the speeds when travel on flat sand, when traveling on uphill sloped downhill sloped.\n\n4. The speed on flat sand is 60 miles per day while the speed on uphill slope is 80 miles per day and the speed on a downhill slope is 27 miles per day.\n5. The ratios of the speed on uphil slope to the speed on flat sand and downhill slope is 80/60 = 1.33  and the ratio for downhill slope to flat sand and downhill sloped ratio is27/60= 0.45.\n6. The ratios 1.33 and 0.45 respectively represent the speeds on flat sand and down hill slope travel ratio.\n7. So from the ratio we have 1.33 x 0.45=0.6125.\n8. When asked to find average speed the above expression multiplying speed ratio.\n9. This question is about finding average speed in terms of miles per day when Connor rides on flat sand and down hillsides and uphill sloped.\n10. But we are considering an average speed for the above three situations.\n11. Which is to say for every one mile travel on flat sand we also have to travel 1.33 miles on uphills that means we can say that we travel to 2.33 x 4 = 9.32 miles on uphill.\n12. Also, every mile of travel on downhill gives us a value of 1.33 which means we can also say that we travel 1.3 mi on downhill.\n13. Then, we multiply by 3 to give the average speed in terms of mile per day.\n14. The total result from the above exercise is 9.32+1.3 = 10.62 miles per day.\n15. Connor Rides buggy", "answer": " 58"}

F: No, because he only can go between A-B.\nOutput: The question contains a riddle where the man is waiting at two different locations. The boat is traveling from A->B; the man is traveling from A -> B. \n\n1. The man is not happy because he traveled in a boat, not in the best possible way because the boat is leaving before he can enter.\n\n2. Choice A: Yes, because it was taking too long: the boat is not necessarily taking the \"best possible\" route from A->B. In fact, it's stated in the problem that the boat's route is the most direct route. But the \"best route\" would be if the boat stops at A, and then allows the man to enter, not just leaving before the man can enter. \n\n3.

{"text": "1. Each row of seats in the bus is denoted as R, where R is numbered starting from 1 at the back and 23 at the front of the bus. \n2. Each seat in the Rth row is denoted as Si, where i goes from 1 to 4. \n3. Let Ai be the set of all numbers 1 to 16 (i.e., the index set of Rth row) and B\u2081\u2081 be the index set of the empty seats. \n4. From the given information, we can observe that the seats are arranged in R rows and each has 4 seats in total. \n5. We can also observe that 8 seats remain vacant in the second stop (i.e., 17 gets on and 10 leave). \n6. So, the number of seats in the second stop must be even because the total number of empty seats (i.e., B\u2081\u2082) must be the product of two even numbers (17\u00d710=170), and the total number of seats occupied in the second stop (17+10)=27 is also even (even\u00d7even=even). \n7. Since 23 is odd, we can conclude that (23-2=21) people climbed in the starting before it reached the first stop. \n8. We can therefore determine that Rth row consists of four unspecified vacant seats A\u2083\u2083 after R=23, meaning after the second stop. \n9. After that, the number of vacant seats = 170/2=85 seats.\nSo the final result is B\u2081\u2082=8.\n\n\n# Solution from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-best-time-to-take-the-bus-question-set-8/\n\n## Solution:\nWe need to store rows of seats and check if seats will be available in the next stop or not.\n\n```py\nn=int(input())\nrows=list(range(n+1,33))\nnum=int(input()) # number of people to board the bus from the back\nn1=int(input())[ # number of people to get down from the next stop\nprint(rows[n//4 + n//4 % 4])\n```", "answer": " 57"}

A genius' answer is top marks in mathematics. Mathematical intelligence is amazing, like a calculator.\n6. The intelligence that is smart is also the intelligence that is calculating.\n7. Therefore, you can multiply the number of answers = the number of intelligence / Calculator. The number of intelligence does not equal a calculator. Therefore, it is the answer.\n8.

So, if they would eat the 80% (their total calorie intake) of food intake then they would eat 8 pounds of protein a day in total. \n\nSo the answer has to be B: 4 pounds but, protein can't be >210 grams.\nSo, B cannot be an answer. \n\nAlso, C cannot be an answer because protein would be less than 15% of total calorie", "answer": " 14"}

Since the quantity of the goods sold is the only thing that is relevant to the question, we will only pay attention to it.\n2) The goods Sab and Dane sold were not of the same type. The shoes cost $3 each and the shirts cost $2 each. That means that one pair of shoes cost $6 and one shirt cost $4. Therefore, in order to sell 18 shirfs, it would be necessary to spend more than $1 from their own pocket. This means that for every extra shirt the sellers sell, they lose at least $1 and gain at most $2.\n3) Since Sab sold more pairs of shoes, they gained $20 from the sale of shoes. This means that they sold 12 pairs of shoes for a total of $36.\n4) However, Dane sold more shirts, so they lost $20 from the selling of the shirts.

Given the following information, we can determine the amount of water leaked in ounces, over a 2-hours time period.\n3. The largest hole leaks water at 3 ounces per minute, which amounts to 3 * 60 * 1 = 180 ounces of water per hour.\n4. The medium-sized holes leaks water at half the rate of the larger hole, which is half of 180 \u00f7 2 = 90 ounces of rainwater per hour.\n5. The smallest hole leaks water through at a rate of 1/3 the rate of the medium hole, which is 3 * 6 * 2 / (4 * 180) = 4 ounces of water over 2 hours.\n6. Hence, the amount of water leaks from all three holes over an hour is equal to 0.3 * 90 + 90 + 4 = 174 ounces of rain water.\n7. If the three holes remain open for a whole 2-hours, then the total amount of water leaked from all three holes is equal to 1 hour * 174 \u00f7 hours in a day = 174 / 24 = 7.18 ounces of rain per day.\n\nSo the final answer of 7.18\n\n\n\n\n\n# 7.

But how many days in his entire week is he doing both catching up and working?\n2. The first part of the question is asking about how many hours does he spends on catching up per day in the week and not per week.

{"text": "1 The question asks how long it will take Veronica to pit 3 pounds of cherries.\n\n2. To determine the time it will take to pit 3 pounds, it is important to calculate the number of minutes required to pit 3 pounds first.\n\n3. Veronica needs 3 pound of pitted cherries, but there are only 80 single cherry in 1 pound. Therefore, we must first calculate 3 pounds as 4 pound, then multiply the 3 pound pitted cherries by 20.\n\n4. 40*20=800 \n\n5. Then, we must apply the principle of multiplication to calculate the time required to pit 3 pound cherries by multiplying 800 cherries with 10 minutes.\n\n6. 800*10 = 8000 minutes which is less than 8 hours because we can't make a pie in under 24 hours, so we'll round down to 4 hours.\n\n7. To make a cherry pie with 3 pounds of pited cherries using the formula 8000/20, we'd need 400 minutes to pit 8000 cherries. To complete 3 pounds of pitting, we'd need to multiply by 3.\n\n8. By multiplying 400 and 3, we would require 1200 minutes to pit the 3 pounds. However, we've already calculated the time in minutes, so we'd just need to convert this to hours.\n\n9. The unit of time we use to indicate an increment of time or a duration is the hour. This is the time we need to use to get the answer to the question, because the question is talking about hours.\n\n10. The process of pit 1 pound of cherries is to pit 20 single cherries, so the number of pits to be placed for 3 pounds of cherry is 3*80 or 240. \n\n11. The time required to pit 1 pound is 10 minutes, so multiplying 10 minutes by 20, we get to 200 minutes.\n\n12. We now have 240 pits in 200", "answer": " 2"}

The equation is $104/$9 = 11 hours\nIf you follow the steps given above, you'll be able to answer this question. \nSo the final answer for total hours = 13\nAmount per hour = $117\nThis question doesn't involve any trickery because all the calculations are pretty simple. \n\nInput:When is 15 added to a number positive or negative?\nOutput:  The number 15 added to any positive or negative number will always be a positive number.\n(i.e) -ve number + positive number = positive number\n\n(15 + -14) = 1 or 15 - 14 = 1\nOr (15 + -3) = 23 or 15 -3 = 12\n\n-15 + 15 = 5(positive)\n\nInput: Is 1 hour 3 minutes equal to 75 minutes?\nOutput:  No, the answer is 66 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\nIn this scenario, a time conversion from minutes (1h 3min) to an hour is made with an assumption that we need to convert first 1 minute into 60 seconds (because 1min is 1/60 of an hour).\n\nThe correct conversion of 1 minute : 60 seconds\nSo here, 1 is equal to 1/60 (minutes)\nSo 1 1/60 will be equal to 75\nThat is, 1 and 60/100 are", "answer": " 117"}

We can then simplify and say that He spent(S) of $1.2 per notepad (not including the tax). \n5. So we must find the total cost spent on the notepads. So the answer is (S * cnt)+tax \n6. We can further simplify this and say cnt = S * $1.25 because  S* (1.25) is a lot more than the initial question.\n7. So the answer is $60 + tax dollars.  \n8. To find the tax part, we divide the 1.25 by 1.10 and that would give us a tax of 0.125 dollars a notepad.  We multiply 60 by 0.12 (i.e. 12 cents per notepad)to get our result 7.2 dollars as tax. \nSo the final  answer is $129.2 (S* 1.10* 1.25 + 12 cents)\n\nInput:  The word \"might\" is best described as...

The answer 48\nOutput: 1: The answer is 10 because it is the only option that is divisible by 3 and has a remainder of 5, which makes it a multiple of 3, and which also has a quotient (2, the number you are after) and the remainder 1. 1 is the only option that satisfies all these conditions.\n2: The answer is 30 because any multiple of 3 must divide 15 evenly and it is the only option which does so.\n3: A multiple of 3 cannot be 1, 2 or 4, because those numbers are divisible by two not by three. So all that we are left with a 5 or 6. In this question, only 5 and 6 are options for a multiple of 3. So 6 is also a possibility\n4: The answer is 45 because 15 is not divisible by anything that is larger than 3, 45 is the number closest to 15.\n\n5: The answer is 60 because, by looking at a clock, you realize that the only 2 options for a multiple of three that would also satisfy the remainder of 2 is 6 and 12, and of those 6 is the only option with a quotient of 2.\n6: The answer is 24, because it is the only multiple of 3 that is smaller than 16, another possible option", "answer": " 46"}

Let us assume that 5 cards are half of 10 cards which is the minimum number of cards he could have given to his friend.\nMalcom could still have 11 cards left. It is clear that Brandon could not have more than 9 cards, so that means 9+11=20 which means the card collection was 20 cards when Brandon started collecting them.\n\n4) We can see that Malcolm started with 8 more cards than the total number of cards owned by Malcom and Brandon together. Therefore, this means that the card collection was 8 more cards than 28 cards which means it was more than 30 cards, so the card collection was 30 cards when Malcom started collecting his cards.\n\n5) Now, when Malcom gave half of the 11 cards to Mark, there were only 10 cards left and when he gave half of these cards, there were five cards left. The final number is 5 as Malcom started with 20 and finished with 5.\n6) Hence, the answer is 5.\nSo the final solution is 5\n\nInput: It is said that a particular city was founded by 987 Roman soldiers and 17 Romans.

So x = 1881.  2x = 1232. 3x = 1359. 3x -x = 2182. If x is a decade then it must be a decade that x is a part of, and 1849 has to end in a 9 to be a decade. So  3 x -", "answer": " 28"}

The question is about the economic situation when the economy is experiencing deflation in the present and has deflated by five years in the future.\n2. In the present, deflation indicates a drop (negative inflation) in the price level of goods and services. This means that prices for consumers tend to decrease (not increase) over time. This means you get more goods for the same money. \n3. In the future, five years from now, the same scenario applies, although it is important to understand what deflation means before discussing its economic impact. \n4. Deflation also means that purchasing power is high. For example, a worker can now afford much more than before, implying that more goods and services will be demanded even with the same income. \n5. In the present and the future, deflation would be favorable for purchasing power in a monetary sense. Consumers will get more value for every dollar spent, and the future economy would be even more favorable. \n6. Overall, considering the situation:\na. Deflation means that the economy experiences lower prices for goods and services than before. \nb. Lower prices for goods means more purchasing power for consumers.\nc.

If a ship travels x nautical miles in x hours, then it is clear that x = x nautical miles, and substituting for x into the denominator we get (x hours) = (x nautical miles)/. 7 nautical miles = 1 hour, so 40 nautial miles = 40/7 hours, which is 5.714 hours.\n2.

Given x= 5.712 hours from item 1, that's the only valid answer.\n\n----\n## Final Instructions\n\nInstruction:\n\nThis is the last section of this quiz.

As Cat has 4 angel fishes, the bluegills should be summed 4+1=5. So 4 goldfish+1 bluegill makes a total of 5 bluegills and she will need to add two more bluegills and subtract them from the goldfishes.  Now, 5+2=7 goldfishes.

The bird's cries could easily be caused by other factors, and it may be difficult to determine the exact source of the noise.\n5: Finally, the answer choice \"from the bird itself\" is not possible since the bird does not communicate through speech and thus cannot reveal how it was killed. \n\n6: Hence, the final answer must be D: by listening to its calls.

{"text": "The question asks how many chickens Lao farmed. Let's look at the statement: \"If he makes $65 in profit from selling his chickens, then there are total of $135 worth of chickens sold\". In other words, he must sell more chickens to make the given amount of profit. \n1. Let us consider, the units of time are days. \n2. $65 in profit will help Lao sell chickens for 2.5 days.\nIf Lao farms 100 chickens, as the question states, then it will take a single day (24 hours) for him to farm and sell, or he will spend 24 hours selling. This is because one day of farming involves 24 hours and selling involves 24 hours for Lao. \n3. Next, let L be a short-hand for Lao. Then: \n$$1 + 2 +... + 23 + 24 + 25 = 135$$\n\n$$1 + 3 +... + 50 = 100$$\n\nWhereas L farms 10, he farms 10 per day (2.5 days), so he has farmed 25 chicks. \n4.

{"text": "1: The question asks how many spider legs, including those belonging to the spiders in the group are present in the group.\n2. The given statements imply that the spider group contains 10 more spider legs than half the number of legs as the main spider possesses. Thus, this shows that the group contains a larger number of spiders or legs than the single spider.\n3. Based on the given information, we can deduce from the given statement: 'the group of spiders has more legs than the single spiders'. Thus, according to the information, the total number of spiders' legs among the group of spiders is greater than 8, which can be arrived at using the equation:\n4. 10 + (8 x 0.5) = 10 + 4.5 = 14.5 5 The number of spiders is likely to be more than the number of legs and that it exceeds 10 legs.\n6.

We know that 1 quart is the same as 2 cups, so we can multiply by 10, which is the equivalent of 4, for convenience.\n4) We want to find the product of 4n, which produces 16n = 16x, and we want to subtract the cost of all of the bottles that contain 40 gallons, or 16n, which gives us 2x.\n5) We simplify by dividing the price of a bottle by the number of bottles in a volume discount, and we see that this reduces to a discount of 16/n. \n6) We find the value of x by dividing 2x by 16 and solving for x. (the answer is not needed, as the next step is to solve for n.)\n7) To finish the problem, we calculate n = 40n/160 = 40/32nds, or 40/2. \n8) We therefore find that 4n = (160 - 20) gallons of champagne.

The company has been successful with its eighth-generation product, and now needs to increase in the size of the product to improve its competitiveness.\n\nThe company will go about deciding the product size in two ways:\n2. 2-D design\n3. 3-D design\n\nThe two types of designs are:\n2. 3-D: this design has a third dimension in the product that a 2-D design does not have, like a hollow space for air to flow through\n\n4. 2-D: this is a flat design without any volume or depth. \n\n5. The two designs are also different in the way they are created:\n\n2. 3D is created before manufacturing the product\n\n6. 2-D is created during manufacturing the product\n7. The company has to decide whether it will use the 3D or the 2D design when creating the product.\n8. If the company wants to avoid making errors in production and wants to increase profitability, it would be wise for the company to use a 2-D model.\n9. This model will allow the company to manufacture the product with fewer mistakes and lower production costs.\n10. However, if the company wants to make an accurate representation of the product before manufacturing begins, 3D design would be more accurate. \n11.

{"text": "1. The question asks how old the subject is now, given the fact that in ten years, they will be twice their brother's age and the sum of their ages will be 45 years at that time. \n2. The given factors can help us know that the boy is younger than 18 years old because we can understand that the boy and his brother will be 15 years old if they are both now 15 years old. If this is the case, they will be 25 years old after 10 years and their sum will be 40.\n3. However, we are given that the total sum will be 45 after the given amount of time, so this means that they were both younger than 18, and their sum was 35, then the boy's brother must be at least 18 years old since they will be 35 years old in 10 years and the total for the two will be 45. \n4. From the boy's perspective, the only way to achieve the desired answer is to be 13 years old and the brother's age to be 38 years old. \n5. When the boy would be 25 years in 10 years, the brother would only be 43 years old, hence not possible with the current age structure of 18 or older.\n6.

{"text": "1: We want to know how many inches of snow on the snowdrift on day 1.\n2: We can use the known information to help us solve the problem. We know the snowdrift was at its smallest on the day 1, which means it must have been at its biggest on the 4th day.\n3: The snowdrift was 18 inches deep on the 4th after 6 inches of snow falling on top.\n4. When a snowdrift is added onto the first day, we need to figure out how much snow is needed so that it reaches the correct depth of 18 inches.\n5. When working with addition problems, you can use the number of inches that you want to arrive to subtract the number you have.\n6. The snowdrift on day two was 14 inches deep, so it needed 4 more inches to arrive at 18 inches. So we subtract 4 from 18, which is the answer to our calculation.\n7. We want to add 6 more inches onto the previous 6 to get 12.  We then subtract 12 from 18, and we find that we get 6 more inches, which is our final answer.\n8. Then, 18 - 12 = 6 more inches since the drift reached 18 inches deep after the 4 inches of snow on day two.\n9.

Choices: 1: factoring a quadratic expression 2: combining like terms. 3: using the distributive property 4: reducing polynomials 5: evaluating inverse trigonometric functions\nOutput: 1: factor of a quadratic expression is only one of the steps involved in solving quadratic equations, so it doesn't involve just algebra as such.\n\n2: combining like terms involves substitution of algebraic expressions or a manipulation of basic algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3: using the distributivity property does not involve algebra.\n\n4: evaluating inverse functions like tan^-1 does not involve either algebra or factoring, and is a special case of the inverse trigonometric functions involving trigonometric ratios. Hence, it does not involve algebra and can be ruled out.\n\n5: reducing polynomials doesn't use simple algebraic expressions or operations as such, and is the process in which higher powers are simplified to a single power.

{"text": "1. The question asks us to find the cost of the remaining metal roofing required by Mr Caiden.\n2. It is clear from the given information that we are presented with a scenario where Mr Caiden will have 250 feet worth of free metal roofing from the supplier and the remaining supply would require him to pay $8 each or around 300 feet.\n3. We are now required to use this information to find out the price of any further metal roofing that he will have to pay for.\n4. We begin by dividing the price of metal roofing, as given in question, by 8, the cost of each foot.\n5. After dividing, we get 8 as the answer. This shows that the cost of each whole foot is equal to 8.\n6. So, in order to calculate the cost for 1 foot of the metal roofing, first we take out 8 from the number of feet required. Now, Mr Caiden needs to pay for 300 \u00f7 8. This gives us 37.5 feet which is the required number of feet he pays for.\n7. Since 100 feet are already being given to him for free, he would need to pay just 37.5x8 for 300.\n8. The cost is thus $360 which gives us the answer, since 100 is being provided to him without any cost.\nSo the final cost is $360.\nSo the answer is $360\n\nInput: The company gave all employees an anonymous evaluation of their performance.

It is likely that \"fresh vegetables\" includes lettuce and tomatoes, both of which have the same price per head, according to the question.\n3. The number of heads of lettuce that the grocery store \"receive (s) in sales\" per month may be given by \"500 customers per months\" because one head of lettuce is used for each customer per month on average.\n4. Similarly, the number of tomatoes the grocery store receives in sales per month may be given as \"4 tomatoes for $ 0.5 apieces\" because each tomato is used for each customer purchases 0.5 tomatoes per month on average. \n5. Therefore, the amount of money that is earned in lettuce and tomato sales, in dollars, is \"2 heads of lettuce x $1\" + \"4 tomatoes x $ 0.5\" = \"9 lettuce x $1 + 8 tomatoes x $0.5\" = $5.3.\n6. However, a total of \"500 customers (x) 1 head of lettuce + 4 tomatoes\" = $8.5. Therefore, the question is: \"How many heads of lettuce sold per month and how many tomatoes sold per month if the difference between the total money made through sales of lettuce and the total money made through tomato sales is $8.5 dollars?\"\n7. It can be easily found that the number of heads of lettuces that can provide this balance of money is 3+4+6+9+10+12+14+15+16+18+20+21+23+, where each number is multiplied by 1, the number of tomato sales. In other words, \"500 customers x 0.6 heads of lettuce + 7.5 tomatoes = $8.5\". \n8. Therefore, since $8.5 = 6.0 + 7.5, the answer is $13.5.\nSo the final answers is $13. 5\n# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n'''\n\n\n'''\n\t\t\t## I - Basic Math Question", "answer": " 2000"}

{"text": "1) This is a typical data sufficiency question which asks for the amount of kibble remaining in the bag after all the kibble had been eaten.\n\n2) One bag of kibble is 12 cups, which is a large amount for Luna to eat.\n\n3) Luna's master is given to feeding Luna kibble, and Mary gives Luna a total of 2 cups of food in the morning and in the evening. But later, Frank gives Luna 2 cups of extra kibble in the late evening. There are two possibilities that can happen:\n\n1. Frank gives Luna a total 4 cups of extra kebble\n\n2. Frank gives Luna 8 cups of kibbles\n\nIf Frank gives Luna 4 cups of kibbling, then the total cups of kibbble that Mary can give is 4 + 2 = 6 because Frank has given a total of 4 cups extra.\n\nHowever, if Frank gives Luna half more than the remaining, Mary can't fill up all the cups with her previous amount of 2 cups. Therefore, there must be at least 1 cup left.\n\nIf Frank gives less than 8 cups of extra khibbling, then Mary can use her total 2 cups that she gave in Morning and evening and then give 4 more cups since Frank has given only 1 cup of extra kibblings. But this doesn't happen if Frank gave greater than 8 cups extra. Hence, the answer must be 7 cups.\n\nSo the final answeris 7 cups\n\nInput:How much is the area (square) of a kite?

Add the total mileage driven to the total mileage left \n\nv. Divide the total mileage left by the total mileage driven \n\nvi. The answer is the quotient.\n\n3. Given the information, we can perform the following calculation:\n\ni. Amoli traveled for 3 hours. That is 3 x 60 = 180 miles\n\nii. Anayet traveled for 2 hours. That is 2 x 60 =\n\n420 miles\n\n4. The total mileage driven by Amoli is 180 + 2 x 61 miles = 421 miles. Similarly, the total mileage driven for Anayet is 2 x 42 + 61 miles =\n\n428 miles\n\n5. Hence, the total mileage for Amoli + the total mileage for Anayet is\n\n421 + 428 miles.\n\n6. Based on the question, the total miles left to travel is 369 - 421 - 428 = 400 miles.\n\n7. To divide the total miles left to the total mileage driven, we multiply the number of miles left with the number of miles driven.\n\n8.

We will calculate taxes separately under part B.\n5) When calculating the tithe (10% of income), we don't have to worry about the taxes that Alex already paid. That is because the tithe is a proportion of income, not of taxes paid. Since Alex's total income is the same each week (assuming no changes in tax deduction), the amount of tithe won't change. \n6) To calculate the tithe, you could just multiply 10% by the total remaining income (after taxes), but that gives you too little money to pay bills and tithings. To get a more accurate estimate, you should include the taxes in the calculation of the tithe. \n7) Let's assume that Alex receives $600 as the total remaining income after taxes. How much tax does Alex pay on that $600 (assuming no other deductions like insurance, etc.)? $600 x 10% = $60. Now we can include the $60 of withholding tax in the calculation of the total remaining income. $600 + $60 = $660.

The question is how much James pays for a bed and the frame, and we are given a formula for the frame: it's $75 + 10x.\n\n4. We know that the total price isn't given, but it's likely to be the price of the bed + the price of the frame.\n5. We can thus set up a simple equation for it, where frame_price = bed_price + 75:\n    10x + 75 = bed_price + bed_price\n6. Let's solve this equation:\n    10(x + 75) = x + bed_price + bedprice\n    x + (10x + 10*75) = x\n    x + 10*(10x + 875) = 0\n    x + 875 = 0\n    -875 = x\n    x = -875\n    bedprice = -875 + bed_price\n\n7. The question indicates that James pays $1,725 for the bed. \n\n8. This means that James' total payment is the bed price +875, which is -625 + bed_price, so in total, he pays -625 + 1,725 = 1,100 for the bed and frame, which is the correct answer.\nSo the final Answer is Choice D: 1100\n\n\n# Solution\n```bash\n$ bash questions.sh\nThe answer to the question is option C: 1225\nFor the second question Answer is Choice a: 1560. \nThe third answer is Choice E: -150\nThe fourth answer is Choice C: 1200\nThe final answer is Choice D: B. \nThe answer to question 1  is Choice D: -10\nThe answer to question for 4 is Choice C: none of the above\nAnd the Answer to the fifth question is Choice D: C.\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nYou chose", "answer": " 660"}

From this, we can deduce the following:\na. The final location of the man is 8 + 6 = 14 kilometers away from his starting point.\n\nb. The man walked in the direction of North (N). \n\nc. The second half of the question, about walking the same path, essentially refers to the direction of East (E), which is to the right of North and is in the opposite direction of the original journey.\n3. The question then asks a man to end up where he began: this indicates that the man has already covered the full 14 kilometer distance and is back at the same location where he began the journey. \n4. Therefore, the man does not need to do any further walking, but rather return to the direction of original journey N. \n5. It cannot be possible to travel East (E) to return to the same location, because the man would end up in a completely different position.\n6.

{"text": "1) There are two ways you could answer this question. One is to find the number of dogs, and one is to find the total number of animals (which includes other animals besides dogs and cats).\n\n2) First, we will find the number of dogs. We don\u2019t know how many cats there are, so we will find the number \u201cless than the number of dogs\u201d. The question states if the number of cats are 20% less, we need to find less than 20% of the number of dogs.\n\n3) To calculate less than 20%, we multiply 0.2 by the number of dogs. In a compound, the total number of animals is 160 froggies. There is a total of 160 frogies in the complex if there are 150 frogs. \n4) We know that 0.2 is 20%, so we can multiply 0.2 with the number of dogs. 5) There are 2 times as many canines as canines and dogs, because they are dogs and frogs. We put 2 times more canines than the number of dogs we found in the first place, because we already found the total number of animals and that number is less than the number of frogs.\n\n6) There are 100 more animals than the total number of animals, because the number of animals is 2 times as many dogs as frogs. We need to find 2 times more frogs because there are many frogs in the complex and there are more frogs than dogs.\n\n7) We already found how many dogs there are in the compound if we add up all the results. We already found how many animals there are in the complex if we add up all of the animals together. We are done if we have found the number of dogs and the number of frogs, because we now know how many animals are in the compound.\n\nSo the final answer  is 150 dogs plus 240 frogs = 390 frogs if there are 130 frogs in the compound we can calculate.\nSo the final answeris 390 froggies\nSo the final answer: 390 frog-frogs\n\nInput: An old-fashioned barnyard can have many different animals of what", "answer": " 304"}

As opposed to the phrase, 'Some people do eat fish,' this sentence implies that some people won't eat fish for whatever reason. \n2.) However, the question is too general, as there can be any number of possible reasons why some people don't eat meat. Therefore, there isn't enough information to say definitively which answer is a good explanation.\n3.) The answer choices suggest that the reason for not eating fish is to reduce fat intake, the avoidance of fishy taste, or a preference for vegetables, but these are limited considerations.\n4.)

Choices: 1) the percent of A that is B 2) the proportion of A/B 3) the ratio of A:B 4) the ratio of A or B\nOutput:\nThe relationship between two items can be expressed by using percentages, proportions, ratios, and quotients. For example, the percentage of A can be calculated as number of A/ total number of A or A/ total number of items x 100. Similarly, a proportion can be defined as the number of A divided by the number of B, while ratios can be written as number of A divided by number of B. Ratio also includes quotient which is another way of expressing ratios, namely number of A/ number of B. A is also a type of rate, namely the rate of number of A/ number B. A is also another type of rate and quantity, namely number of A in one unit of quantity divided by number of B in one unit of quantity.\n\nSo the final answer 04) the ratio of a/b or A to B is the only one that is not a quantity, a type of rate or ration, and not a rate or proportion.\n\nInput:How do you compare a fraction with 5 as the numerator?

The statement \"finally, Wendi found an entire 4 less than ten\" indicates that the total of the chickens equals 4 less than 10, or 6. The chickens are described as \"additional chickens.\"  Furthermore, the sentence \"Finally, Wendi found four additional chickens\" describes the last event, so Wendi must have found another 1 chicken for a total of 7 chickens.

{"text": "1. The first thing to note is that the number of pencils per box is determined by the total number of pencils divided by the number of friends.  This gives us the equation 10 + 8 = 10 + 5 = 15. \n2. Next, we need to solve for the number of pencil in each box. 15 = x \u00f7 5, where x is the number of penciles in each box. \n3. Solving by cross multiplication can be done as: 15 = x + x + x + x x/5 or x = 15/5 which gives us x = 3. Finally, we check our answer by plugging the numbers back into the equation to ensure that the equation still holds true. 10 + 3 = 15. If x = 3 then the equation 15 = 3(x \u00f7 5) or 15 = 6(x \u00f7 2) or 15x/6 = 100 which holds true.

{"text": "1) The question asks how many minutes Leo took to finish the third part of his assignment, given the information that the first part took him 25 minutes and the second part took him twice as long.\n2) To find the solution, first, multiply the amount of time taken to complete the first part by 4 to get the amount of time taken for the second part. This is because we can use the rule of 2 which states that half the first part + more than half the second part + the last part = the original part.[ref]Simply because Leo took twice the time of the first part to finish the second one and is almost done with the assignment means he must have more than half the time used to finish the second part.[/ref]\nSo let's call A to be the amount of time Leo spent in the first part and B to be the time he took to finish the second part, so we have: 2*B = 2*25, so B = 50\n1) Thus, the time taken by Leo for the first part = 25, the time taken for the second would be 100 minutes and the time he took to complete the third would be 125 minutes.\n\n2) Hence, Leo took 75 minutes to finish the third part.\n\nSo the final answer\n\nInput: If it takes 2 hours for 8 hours worth of work to be done, how long will it take to do 4 hours worth of work? \nOutput: 1).We're looking to find out how long the work will take when the amount of work to be done is given for a fixed work period, here 8hr for completing 8hr worth of work. \n2).

Choice B: the total for this season is not relevant to the question, as it is only asking about the total number for that season.\n4. Likewise, Choice C: number of potatoes in the garden is also irrelevant to the question. So it is eliminated. \n5. From the three choices, Choice D: total vegetables is the correct answer because it correctly states the question asked in the question.\nSo, the answer is D: total.\n\nFollowing step:\n6. Next, the question is asking about the quantity produced in the garden. Therefore, 237 is equal to the total number of potatoes produced in the garden minus the number of cucumbers. \n7. Similarly, 167 is the total number of vegetable types minus the number of cukes (i.e. vegetables minus cucumbers), but if we are asked for total quantity. then it is 60 cucumbers multiplied by 167 to get the total.\n8. Therefore, to know the answer to total vegetable quantity in the garden, we multiply 60 to 237 to get the answer. \n9. By simplifying 237 * 60 = 13920.\n10. Therefore, the answer is 13921.

{"text": "The question is asking about how much WinWin is able to take home after paying tax and processing fees. Let the amount of money she won be A, a number between 1 and 100. The cost for TAX is B, a number between 0 and A/10 and the cost for the processing fee is C, a number between 5 and A/5. Since we know that A, A/2, and A/5 are all possible, we can find which pairs will lead us to a possible answer. \n1. Since tax is a percentage, TAX= 100*Tax/100, then the cost for tax is TAX*C=(100*T)/(100*C). \n2. Since we are not dealing with an exact amount of dollars, we will approximate the number using integer division. So we can approximate TAX= 1 and thus TAX*C= 100/5. \n3. Because A/100 is also a possible number, we have 2 options for tax 3 and 4. If A=100 then the cost of tax would be 10 and processin fees would be 5. This leads to a possibility for the sum of A-Tax*C= A-100/5 so that B=700. However, this is an incorrect pair since A=100 leads to a different answer of 10. \n4. We can also write B=A*A/2, this yields an exact pair that solves the problem. After solving, we get B=100 and A=1000.

{"text": "1) To divide up the cost, we first need to know how much burgers they bought since the cost of the burgers is the same for everyone. By taking the cost of the burgars, $100, and dividing by the total number of people, $4, we see that each person spent $25 on burgars. \n2) Alcohol is separate so we add $200 to our total. \n3) The cost of $80 for condiments and propane could cost the same for each person. However, the cost of $80 can also cost each person differently depending on the total number and how each person uses it. So for this part, we multiply $80 by the number of people which adds $80. \n4) Each person took a turn buying supplies. Since John was the host, we need to include the whole cost again, so we add another $40. \n5) For the total, we add an extra $4 just to be safe. \nSo the final answer (with extra dollars in case there are any rounded numbers) is $604.02\n\nInput: A woman in a store is looking at the dresses.

Above this ice sheet are glaciers.  Glaciers on ice sheets can move, and often move quickly, because the ice underneath them melts more quickly on the ocean than on land. What do you think is the reason why the land-based ice sheets are smaller than the ones in Antarctica? Choices: 1.A: Because they melt more quickly 2.A: Because they are smaller 3.B: More ice in Antarctica than ice sheets 4.B: Water from ice sheets drains into the ocean 5.C: Because they are denser Ice sheets with a large volume of water mixed in them tend to stay where they are. On the other hand, glaciers will slide down from the tops of ice sheets in some parts of the world, such as Antarctica and Greenland. The reason why sea-based ice sheets are larger than glaciers in Antarctica is because the ice sheets have less water mixed in them. It means that these ice sheets are less dense. Because of the less dense ice sheets, they do not stay where they are and instead flow a lot faster than glaciers do. Hence, the correct answer is: 4. Glaciers on ice-sheets can move, and often more quickly, because the ice beneath them melts more quickly in the ocean than on land, and this is the reason why ice-sheets are smaller than the ones on Antarctica. \n\nInput: \n\nOne of the most crucial features of digital signage advertising is the ability to update the content on the screen at specific intervals.

In order to solve the problem, consider the proportion of people that drive to work compared to those who take public transport, and then figure out the remaining 30% of the employees. \n4. 60% * 100 = 60, and we have 200 employees\n\n5. We don\u2019t know how many more employees drive to vs take public transport, so we are just looking for remaining employees to fill the remaining 30%.\n\n6.  In order to determine the percentage of people who take public transportation, we can substitute 100% as the numerator into the proportion we just calculated to find out how the remaining employees are divided. \n\n7.' 200' * '60' = 1200, '100%' = 400, then '60/100' = 0.6 = 60/10\n\n8.

{"text": "1. The question asks us to compute the length of shadows in inches.\n2. Solving this problem requires us to use the principle of similar triangles, in which two triangles are proportional due to similar angles and sides (in this question, A = b/c and c = a  * (a + b)/c). By substituting the values given in the question, we obtain the following formula: c / (a - b) = (a + b)/(a * (a + b)) = (a + b) / (a + 2*b) \n3. Solving for c and substituting in for a and b, we get that c = (a + b ) / b, or C = (a + b + 1) / a because a is the base of our triangle.\n4. To convert meters to inches, divide by 39.37 inches per meter.\n5. Hence, the answer to the question is 63.9 inches.\nSo the final step to solve this question is C = (a + 2a + 1) / 3a or the answer is 63.702 inches.\nSo the output is 63.8 inches.\n\nInput: Given that there are no negative integers between -3 and 23, what is the exact value of -3+14-12+23?\nOutput:\nFirst, we notice that no negative integer values fit between -3 and 12, because we have no negative numbers between -3 and -2, and -1 is the closest number we have to -2, and -3 is the closest number we can get from -4 down to 1, and -2 is the closest number we get from -3 to 0. \nWe'll use the fact that positive and negative numbers when added have the same sign to show that, for example, -2 + 7 = 5 + -2 = -1. \nBecause we have no negative numbers to add, we are only left with positive numbers, so we may use the fact that positive numbers to replace -2 with 2, and that 2 + 7 =9, so the sum is -1. \nSimilarly, we may use this fact once more in the next addition to get -2 + -2 = -3. \n3", "answer": " 360"}

The question requires us to determine how many slices of cake are left after Alex has eaten 3 slices, assuming that there is already a fraction of the original cake that has been given away. \n2. We can follow the given steps to calculate the answer. \n3. The first step is to determine how many sliced pieces of cake were left after the friends and the family were given their fair share. \n4. This step is 60 slices, since each cake contains 80 slices, and a quarter of the 80 is 20. \n5. This leaves us with a total of 60 slices of cake after the slices given to the friends and the family. \n6. Now, we subtract the number of slices that Alex ate from the number of sliced pieces of remaining cake \n7.

{"text": "Here's the answer with step by step answer\n1. First, we must find the length of each piece of rope for the given rope length of 20 feet.\n2. To calculate the length of each piece, we will break the 20-foot rope into pieces of 10 feet each. \n3. We know that each piece of rope is 20 feet, so to find the length of each portion or piece, we will need to divide it by the 10-foot piece length.\n4. To calculate the length, we will need to take the whole 20 feet (20/20=1) and then break it into pieces of 1/10. \n5. We will then multiply 1/10 (1.0) by itself to find the amount of pieces. However, we will need subtract 0.25 to account for the loss of 0.25 of the rope during lashing together.\n6. The step-by-step equation and answer is: (0.25*1/10)*(0.25*0.5/10)*(1/10)*0.5=2/5\n7.

One possibility is if Archie began with 600 marbles and lost half in the street process, then he lost half of his remaining 300 in the drainage, which would leave him with only 20 marbles:\n\n600 -.6 * 600 = 150\n150 -.5 * 150 = 75\n75 -.5 * 75 = 25\n25 -.5 *25 = 5\n5 -.5 *5 = 0\n\nAnother possibility is if Archie started with 600, and half of all his marbles were taken from him in the street process, he would only have 300 left, which means that he would lose half in the drainage process:\n\n300 -.5 *300 = 100\n100 -.5* 100 = 50\n50 -.5*50 = 10\n10 -.5*10 = 0\n\nIn short, Archie could begin with an initial amount that is a multiple of 20, which is why 600 and 300 would work.\n4) The answer is (1) 20(3), because he started with 60 or 30 marbles.", "answer": " 100"}

So the final answer is: 4 times as much as Stu (9) = 12. \nSo, the answer is 4 x Stu = 12\n\nInput: What is equal to 3 x 3 + 3 x 4 + 3 x 5 in terms of a?

{"text": "The question is about how many marbles Emily currently has after the situation has been explained. \n1. The question posits that Emily (the subject) has 6 marbles initially.\n2. Megan (the object) then gives Emily double her initial count of marbles, which translates to 12.\n3. Additionally, Emily gives Megan the difference between her overall new count of marbles and half the initial count, which is 3.\n4. Hence, it can be said that Megan increased Emily's original count to 12 and Emily then gave Megan half of her remaining count, which is 1 more than the starting point. \n5. In simpler words, what Emily gave Megan was 3 more than the original 12. This process can be repeated multiple times.\n6. Hence, the final explanation is that with each incremental exchange, Emily has 6 more marbles, and her final count would be a large number.\n7. So the answer is E: the number of marbles is large.\nSo the final correct answer is E: the final total number of marbles is unknown, because the amount increases in each stage and we don't know how long the exchange process is going to continue.", "answer": " 8"}

So she caught the ball 89 times. To check: 89 x 3 = 277 times\n\n3: Tammy also made double the catches that Joe did, meaning she caught 23 x 2 = 46 more times than Joe did.

{"text": "This question is asking about how much time Max spent doing his homework, where, and which subjects took the longest.\n\n1. The first thing to understand is that Max completed each subject 40 minutes apart. It took 20 minutes to complete history, two times as much for biology, and 3 times more for geography.\n\n2. The second thing to understand is that the question refers to the subject, and not the subject in a whole. For example, if Max studied 8 hours for biology it does not mean that he studied 8 hours for history or geography. This also means that it took him 20x more time to study history than to study geography. (As history was studied twice the number of times than geography was studied, i.e. in total, the time Max studied history was 40 + 40 = 80, whereas geography took only 30 minutes). \n\n3. Hence, Max spent 30 minutes on his biology homework, 40 minutes on his history homework, and 60 minutes on his geography homework. If we summarize, he took 30min + 40min + 60min = 130 minutes to complete all the homework. Multiplying that time by 60 to convert it to hours, we find that it took him 7.8 hours.\n\n4. Consequently, he did a total of 7.8 hours to complete his homework. He studied history 40 minutes more than he studied the other subjects, thus the question asks for which subject Max spent the most time studying. Although he studied each subject for 1 hour and 30 minutes more than he spent studying the other subjects combined, geography took Max the most time to study because it took 60 minutes more to study than the combined total of history and biology.\n\nSo the final answer answer is E: Geography, because of its time to study compared to the other subjects combined.\nSo the final ans is E: Geography.\n\nInput: The only people who speak Greek at this conference are the people from Greece.

What is a sentence fragment? \nIn a sentence, each separate clause needs a punctuation mark to connect it to the next word or sentence for the sentence to be understood and to produce a meaning. However, when a sentence is incomplete and does not include all these elements, it is called fragment. They are sentences that are incomplete.\n\n### Sentence Fragment \nSentence fragment refers to the incomplete section of sentences having at least one word in the fragment missing to make it comprehensible and complete. It is a part or a piece of a sentence lacking words or other necessary parts to make it a complete sentence. \n\nA sentence can have multiple fragments if any or more of its components are lacking and incomplete. Sentences are the smallest and simplest units of thought; every sentence conveys a thought; they all have a noun and a verb. The most important and crucial part of the whole sentence is the verb, and the complete sentence must contain at least one verb. \n\nSentence fragments do not contain a subject and can be incomplete as well. It is not grammatically complete because it cannot stand alone. As a result, it has a structure that is missing a crucial or vital part. A sentence fragment contains just one clause with a subject that is incomplete. \n\nA complete sentence must include a subject and a verb. Additionally, every complete sentence consists of at least one finite verb. The two types of finite verbs consist of the principal verb and the complement, which is often the subject or verb.

In general, you can multiply the percentage seen by how many more ants you see than another person does to find the number of ants you see. \n5: Choice D: Duke finds half as many ants, so multiplying 50% of 2 by an ant, means Duke sees 10 ants. \n6: In order to calculate the final number of ants, we must combine how many ants each child sees individually.\nWe must first find out the numbers for each child based on how many ants each sees individually and  then multiply these numbers together and add the results of each multiplication to get the total number of ants.\n7: To calculate Beth's number of ants, multiply 50% by 100, which is 25. Multiply this by 100% as per the percentages. Therefore, Beth's number of total ants = 25 * (100% - 25%), which is equal to 488 ants.\n8: Similarly, to calculate how many ants CeCe sees, multiply 50 by 2, which gives 100. As 300% are double of 100%, multiply this by 300%.\nTherefore, CeCe's number of total ant = 300 * (300% - 100%) which yields a calculation of 600 ants.\n9: To calculate Duke's number of an ant, multiply 26 by 50%, which is 13.

{"text": "This question requires the solver to use an arithmetic approach where they need to compare the two-time quantities and then use the rule of three to calculate the minimum number of steps or actions.\n\nThe solver must first count the number of minutes it will take to completely fill the 120-liters.\nOne can assume that the initial time the water was turned on, the water could only fill 46 liters. This means that there are 74 liters left that need to be filled by the same flow rate that was used to initially fill to 46 liters but with the same amount of water that will need to be supplied. For the remaining 74 liters, the flow rate will need to be divided by 74 which will give the number of minutes it would take to completely fill that tank.\n74/12 = 6.0833 33... (rounded down to 6)\nWhich means that 6 minutes is the minimum it would take for the tub to be filled properly and that 6 minutes is a whole number that can be divided into 60 or one minute. Because the time has been minimized, it would take less than (60 x 6) the number of steps it would take to completely supply the desired quantity to the tank. This means that it would take (60 x 5) minutes. \n\nNow, since the solver does not include the initial time it takes for the water to run into the tub. This means that the water will need to be provided from the time that it is turned on until the tub is completely filled, which means the solver must add that period to the minutes it takes to fill the tub. To do this, the solver must multiply 60 (since the time must be measured in minutes) by 4 minutes. \n\nSo the final answer will be (60 x 4) + (60 x 3) = 720 + 180 = 900 minutes. \n\n(900 + 20 minutes) rounded down to (900 + 10) = 910 minutes\nSo the final answer\nSo the final answer: 910 minutes or 91 minutes to provide the required flow rate to completely fill the tub.\n\nInput:Alice asks her friend how long it will take to build", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "1.\"A solver flips\" suggests the problem involves a game-changer.\n2. 065 HH (Heads) represents the heads 65 times the coin flips.\n3. So to solve the problem, we need to use binary to represent the data, which is a system for representing numbers using a set of only two digits, represented by either a zero or a one. \n4. Binary is often used for representing information in digital technology systems, and in calculations. \n5. To solve the problem, one might use the number system that is a special number system in which every digit has its own unique place, value, and position: 0 = 0 units, 1 = 1 unit, 10 = 10 units, and so on up to 9 = 9 units.\n6. In order to count the number of heads and tails, we can multiply the value of tails by 2 and heads by 1 because it's represented in Base 6 (Base 2 + 1).\n7.

The sentence says that \"every six cows produce 120 liters of milk per hour\", which indicates that one cow produces 20 liters of the milk.\n\n2. Given that \"In five weeks the cows produce 2160\" liters of milk, the question is asking about the total number of cows on the farm. \n\n3. It can be seen that if every cow yields an average of 20 liters per day, then there should be 4 cows in total.\n4. We can make sure that our calculation is correct before applying the answer. So, 177 + 199 = 376, which is equal to 199 + 376 = 575. \n5. This is the solution for the given question. \nSo the final answer answer is 575\n\nInput: In which direction is the force exerted on a falling object? Choices: 1. A: Up 2. B: Down 3.

Choices: 0 A B C D E\nOutput: 1 The question is about the relative prevalence of a cancerous tumor versus cancer.\n\n2. First, let's think about whether having a tumor is common.\n\n3. A common tumor, or benign tumor, is a non-cancerous growth that may occur anywhere in the body. There are more benign tumors than cancers.\n\n4. Although \"tumor\" is more common than \"cancer,\" it's not the best answer to the question because it's not necessarily a cancerous growth.\n5. Hence, our answer is B: cancer.\n\n6.

{"text": "1. The question is about calculating how many coffee cups were brewed in one week. \n2. To calculate, we need to know how many coffee cups per day were brewed during the week.\n3. According to the information given in the question, the coffee shop brews 40 cups of coffee every weekday and it also brews an additional 80 cups on the weekend. This gives us a weekly total of 120 cups of coffee.\n4. However, based on the information in the question, the total weekend coffee production doesn't specify how long the shop is open on Saturday and Sunday.\n5. In order to calculate the weekly total, we need to know if the shop is open for the entire weekend, from Saturday morning to Sunday evening.\n6. To know this, we can reason that if the shop is closed on Saturday evening and Sunday morning, it would be logically inconsistent for the shop to brew 80 cups of coffee on the weekend.\n7. Therefore, we can conclude that the shop is open for 5 hours a day, each day of the week.\n8. Therefore, each day of the seven days, the shop brewed 40 cups and in total in the week, 120 cuph were brewed.\n9. Hence, to get the answer for the week in a single day, we can divide the number of cups by 5, which yields 24 cups per day.\n10. So, to get the weekly number of cups brewed, simply multiply 5 by 7 (5 days multiplied by 7 days of the week) which yields 35 cups, which is the correct answer.\nSo the final calculated answer is 35\n\nInput: A dog wakes up early in the morning but starts to growl and be angry after 6 am, so it might bite or hurt someone after ____ am.

This means he started at 3pm (3 hours before Peter, and at 3pm, Peter hadn't even started so he must have started earlier). Therefore, Fred's driving speed is roughly 4:30/3 = 4:30 minutes per lap.\n\n\u2022 So his speed is 4:30 mph.\n\nThis is because it took peter 30 minutes to drive his lap so if petes", "answer": " 54"}

Joel\u2019s garden is \u201cx\u201d square feet and he wants to use 50% of it for fruits and 50% of the garden for vegetable, so we can calculate the total areas as follows: a1\u2033 +a 2\u2033 = \u201c0.5\u201dx. Since a1\u2019 cannot be zero we can see \u201ca1\u2033 =.5x \u2013 0.5x = 0.5x. \n3-3. \u201ca1\u2033 = 0.5*\u201c64 \u201c. So\u201ca1\u201d = 32 square feet. \n4-4. a2\u2019 is calculated by: a2\u2019 = \u201ca1\u201d +a1\u2019. Therefore\u201ca2\u201d = (\u201c32\u2033 +\u201c0.5\u201dx \u2013 0.25\u201dx) \u2248 32.03 square feet. \n5-5a.

Joel\u2019s area for strawberries would be (\u201ca1\u201d/a3) \u2248 \u201ca3\u2033. Therefore Strawberries area would be as follows \u201c0.5\u203332,02 = 16.01 square feet.\nSo the final solution to this question is 32.06(\u201ctotal area\u201d of Fruit) +32.02(\u201ctotal area\u201d Vegetables) \u2013 16.02(\u201cStrawberries area\u201d) = 108.08 square feet.\nSo a \u201ctotal area\u201d for strawberries will be 108. 08 - 32.08 = 76 square feet.\n\nInput: The president of a company, Joe, who happens to be a very meticulous person, ordered an investigation into her company before and after her husband left to do business in another city.

Let's consider the first set of 100 ships and the ship that is being used for the second part of the question.\n\n4. If we take 100 as the first set of ships, we can assume that each ship is likely to have 23 or more people on board.\n\n5. From the first 100 ships alone, the monster had already consumed 2300 or more people.\n\n6. Let's consider that the ship in question has 200 people, which, multiplied by 2, is the total number of people that the monster has consumed so far.\n\n7. Thus, the total number of people consumed so far must be 400.\n\n8. In the second part of the problem, the monster has consumers 200 people for every 100 ships.\n\n9.

{"text": "1. The question asks for the time it will take Joy to read 128 pages of a book.\n2. To find the answer, we can think of the units of time that could be appropriate here. The book is made up of a certain amount of pages; thus, the answer is not expressed in terms of minutes or hours. Instead, the answer could be expressed in terms of the number of pages read in one unit of time.\n3. For example, if Joy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, we could say she reads 8 pages per 20 minutes. This can be expressed in terms of a rate per time interval, in this case, 4 pages per 10 minutes.\n4. The new equation can be used to calculate the answer as follows: NumberOfPages = ReadingSpeed * TimeInterval, where ReadingSpeed is the rate per unit of time in our case 4 pages per 20 minute. TimeInterval in this case is how long it will take Joy to complete the reading task.\n5. If we substitute the given values for NumberOfPages, ReadingSpeed, and TimeInterval, respectively, and use the formula, we get the answer.\n6. ReadingSpeed is 4 pages, and TimeInterval is 10 minutes.

A: According to the given information, Roque walks to work on two days and bikes to work on two days in a week so the total time spent going to and from work would be 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours on foot and also 1 hour x 2 =2 hours on bike.\n 3. 4 + 2 = 6. Therefore, the answer choice B: 4 hours would be correct.\n4. So we are left with option A, B, C, D and E, eliminating Choice E: 7 hours.\n5. In the third week, the cycle repeats again, so Roque would walk on 2 days and bike on 2 days, thus requiring 2 hours of walking+2 hours of biking (a total of 4 hours).\n6. In the 4th week, Roque walks on 2 days and bikes on 2 days, requiring 2 hours of each mode (totaling 4 hours) The 4th Week: Wed and Fri Roque bikes and walks in a week.\n7. Roque walks on two days and bicycles on two days in a fifth week, and walks on two days. Repeating the cycle once again, so he bikes two days and walks two days in a fifth cycle. The 5th Week: Saturday and Sunday Roque bikes and rides in a week.\n8. So the weekly total of hours required to bike and walk to get to and from Roque's job would be 8 hours. Therefore we would eliminate Choice D: 6 hours.\n9. Since he walks and bikes the same number of days, the number of hours he spends walking should equal the hours spent biking on each day. Therefore, we have to pick an answer choice that would include the same number of hours for walking and biking (2 hours). \n10.

The rate of evaporation is 0.0241 gram/second at this temperature. We take the weight of all the salt to be 0.021 gram with a density of 2.5g/cm^3.\n4. Too, we need to know how much salt is left after evaporation. The answer is 400ml /0.024g.\n5. In order to convert this to grams of salt, we multiply 0.02g by 1000 so that it is in grams. Therefore,.02g/0.024/1000 is equal to 800mg/ml.\n6. We have to multiply this amount by 20% of bucket\u2019s capacity which results in. 20% of an 800-ml salt solution is 0.032 g of salt.\nAfterwards, we must convert the mg/ml to grams, we multiply the answer by 22.4.

This calculation is a bit tedious, so we can find the answer using the modulus operation. Modulus is a mathematical operation that finds the remainder after the division of two numbers and is represented by %.\n\nOutput: The modulus function of a number is to find the remainder after the division by another number. For example, the modulus of 5% will return 0 since 5 is divisible by 2. However, if the given number is divisible by 0, it will result in an undefined value.\n\nOutput: To find the answer in the above example, we divide 140 by five and get 28 pages per each day.

Choices:  A) The boss was unlucky,  B) The boss was lucky,  C) The boss was just,  D) The boss was fair,  E) The boss was neither lucky nor unlucky\nOutput: 1 and 2: It is clear that the option 'unjust' means the boss being unjust to the workers.\n3: The option 'unlucky' isn't the opposite of the correct one. It can only mean that the boss was unluckily unjust to the workers and isn't an opposite of 'unjust'.\n4: The only suitable option for 'fair' can be the correct one. And 'unlucky' is clearly wrong here. B) 'The boss was lucky' is not an appropriate opposite to 'unjust'.\n5: The idea here is that the boss might be lucky or unlucky but, not fair and just at the same time.

{"text": "1. Nate spent a total of 30 minutes searching the parking lot.\n2. A section refers to a specific area of the parking lot. For example, Section G and Section H are two different sections.\n3. The number of rows in these sections can be determined by dividing the length of each section by 10, followed by taking the quotient.\n4. Let\u2019s denote NG=15 and NH = 20\n5. The amount of time that Nate would spend searching each section can be determined by finding the total sum of the times it takes to walk through each row by applying a multiplication factor to the number of rows.\n\n6. Thus, Nate would spend 25 minutes in Section G since it has more rows, followed by 25 minutes in section H.\n7. The total search time can be found by adding the time spent on each section and multiplying it by NG + NH, which comes up to 50.\n8. In order to find the time spent on each row, simply apply the number of times Nate can walk through each row in a minute to the total sum of the rows.\n9. Here:\n10. Therefore, the total search time would be 50 minutes.\n11. Finally, the total search time will be divided by the amount of time it takes to search each row (11 minutes) to find the total time it took for Nate to search the entire parking lot.\n12. Thus, the total search time is divided by 11 to find the number of minutes it took for Nate, which comes out to 4.5 minutes. Therefore, he spent a total of 50 minutes searching.\nSo the final solution is:\nNate got lost looking through every row in his car\u2019s designated section and spent around 30 minutes searching.\n\nInput: At your first birthday party, you made a resolution to be honest.

{"text": "1. The question is about finding the number of times an apple can be placed into Jill's full basket. \n\n2. We know that Jill's basket is twice as big as Jack's basket, which means that it can hold four more apples than the number of apples currently in Jack's basket, since it can hold 12.\n\n3. Therefore, Jill's full capacity minus Jack's full capacity is 12 minus Jack\u2019s capacity of four, or 12 - 4, equals 8 apples. \n\n4. There is currently space for 4 apples. So if 8 apples can be in the full basket, then 4 apples can be put in the basket if 8 is divided by 4. \n\n5. If 8 is used as the number of apples in Jill's basket and 4 is used as the number in Jack's basket for the division, then the quotient is 2, which can be rounded down to 2/4= 0.5 or \u00bd. This means that the number of times a full basket of apples can be placed in Jill's full, is five times.\nSo the final  answer is 5.\n\nInput: A boxing match was set to be held in which of the following countries?

If Amanda's marbles are doubles of Katrina's number of marbles and Amanda has 12 more marble's than Katrina, then it means that Amanda has double + 12 marbles than Katrina.\n2. Now, if we consider Mabel's marbles as 5 times that of Katrina' answer for step 1 then Mabel will have 5 times + 12 mable's than Katrinal.\n3. So we can consider Mabel has a variable for x, we will determine what value of M for the x equation 85 = 12x\n4. Since we know that, 8 = 5 + x, we can solve for the variable x: x = 9, from there, we can subtract Mabel's numbers with Amanda's.\n5. Since we know that the number of marbles of Amanda is 2*Katrina and Mabel has 9 marbles more than Amanda, then Amanda's marble number would be: x*1 \u2013 9\n6. So, 2*Katrine = x \u2013 9, now we can plug 85 to the equation to get the the x value. 85 = 8 + 9\n7. So x = 17\n8.

A shady restaurant is chargin customers gratuities after the taxes instead of before.\n4. Therefore, the customer can only determine how much they were charged for gratuities if they know the total bill and how much the sales tax was.\n5. There are two ways to calculate sales tax in a given region: the flat rate tax (which is the case in the US) or percent tax (which is the European approach). The first approach (US) charges 10% tax of total bill. So the sales tax is the total bill = (10% of total bill) + total bill.\n6. In the second approach (European), the sales tax is the tax, and therefore it is determined by multiplying 10% to the total bill. \n7. \n8, 9. We will start with the European approach, since that is easier to approach. For this approach, the sales tax is $10. Therefore, to calculate gratuity after taxes, we must calculate how much the bill increased: the sum of the items in total bill minus the total bill.\n10. So the customer paid $140 x (10/100) = $14 (not including tip)\n11,12. Now that the total bill has been determined, we can solve the problem using either approach: US or Europeant approach.

He must then subtract these 4.33 total mileage from the desired 20 total miles. \n4 In this case, 4.33/0.66 = 6.63 miles. He has already run half of what he plans to run in a week. \n5 After subtracting the week's remaining 13.37 miles (20 - 6.63 = 13.36), the remaining number of weeks needed to train for the marathons is 13.33 weeks. \nSo the final answer according to the question is 13.44 weeks.\n\nInput: A caterpillar can't see the plant where it's going to eat in order to change.

Also, it is unclear if 2 crackers per night are sandwiches, or if Chad is eati ng just half of a cracker a night. \n10. To answer these questions, we need to work backward from the number of crackers.\n11. We know that Chad is eating crack ers nightly. So, 1 night requires 28 crackers or 5 boxes.\n12. Considering that you have 5 boxes, and you are counting 5 boxes for 5 nights, we could use 28 crackers as your nightly amount.\n13. Next, we count the sleeves of crackers and realize that there is only 2 sleeves per night.\n14. This means that given 5 boxes of crack er, you could only eat 5 sleeves.\n15.

Set this formula equal to 50 to make it equal.\"\n\n7. The solution is 150.\nSo the final solution is 15\n\nInput: What's the difference between the number of a student and the number of a baker? Choices: \nA: the baker is 20 years older than the student\nB: the student's age is 1 more than the bakers age\nC: The student is a baker\nD: the student is not a baker\nE: the student is 20 years younger than the baker\nOutput: 1.. \"The baker is 2 years older than the student.\"\n\n2. Choice A is incorrect because the baker age is more than 4 years from the student age and thus, they cannot be the same.

{"text": "1. The question involves interpreting Calvin's goals and progress towards those goals in terms of percentages.\n2. Calvin is saving his hair clippings to make a wig, and he wants to save enough clippings to cover his dog. This means that the number of hair clippings he needs must be equal to or greater than the length of the hair on his dog's body.\n3. From the given information, Calvin knows that he already has 8 hair clippings and 2 more hair cuts remaining before he can make a full-length wig for his dog from all the clippings he has saved.\n4. We can interpret this as Calvin having a goal of a percentage of 100 to make his final wig, or an amount equal to his dog's hair. Since Calvin has 2 hair cuts left, this means that he only has 2 additional times his haircuts, which equals 5 hair cuts in total, but he already has 8. \n5. Therefore, Calvin will have to add 3 of the other 5 clippings to surpass his goal of 5 remaining cuts.\n6. Hence, in terms of percentages, Calvin currently has a goal of 66% towards his wig, since he has saved 6/10ths of the entire goal, 2 of 5 remaining hair cuts, and his goal is 5 hair clippings. \n7. It should be noted that this answer, 66%, may be slightly different from the other available answer choices which are less than 100% due to rounding error or precision roundings. \nso the final answer is B: 66%", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": "1) The question asks for Greg to determine how much less rain he experienced while camping during at least one week of camping.\n2) First, Greg should know how much rain fell in total in his house.\n3) Greg can estimate the amount of rain that fell during this one week of camping by subtracting the total in his house from the amount of rain that would be expected during that same week in his house.\n4) Thus, we can consider that Greg was camping outside in the woods due to the word \"woods\" in the question.\n5) Based on the statement that the house usually got 26 mm during the same week, we know that Greg's home is near a city or town, which has more people and, therefore, more roofs that potentially hold water from nearby runoff.\n6) Thus, the amount of rain that falls in Greg's home is likely to be much higher than the average amount for the amount of rain that is expected to occur in this area during that same week.\n7) So, subtracting the total amount of rain that occurred in the house from the total amount of rain expected to fall can create an estimate of the amount of rain that occurred while camping outside.\n8) Greg received less rain (only 3 mm, 5 mm, and 3 mm during the three-day period of camping) than he would have received at home in his backyard during the same period.\n9) This is because the total rain that fell during this same period over Greg\u2019s house at his home was higher (26 mm) than the total rain that fell on the three days while camping (9 mm).\n10) So, the amount of rain needed to correct the estimate is 26-9 = 17 mm.

We can assume that both individuals are skipping all 15 minutes.\n\n3. We also know both of their rates and that they are skipping every minute for Roberto.\n\n4. To find the sum, we need to consider the timespan since this factor greatly affects the result.\n\n5. To get the sum, we first need to convert 15 minutes into units of 60 seconds and then multiply this by their respective rates to get the total number of skips.\n6. In this case, we can multiply 15 minutes by 60 seconds because both people are skipping every minute.\n\n7. For Roberto this is 60 x 1080 = 64,800 skips.\n\n8. For Valerie, we multiply 80 by 15 minutes since they are skipping all 60 seconds.\n\n9. This amounts to 1200 skips for Valerie.\n\n10.

From the question it is evident that each day Mark uses an 8-hour workday, and that he uses half his allotments for both sick (41%) and vacation (43%) in one year, so this would mean 16 hours would be worked on 8-hour days in a year.\nThis means Mark will have 64 hours(16hr/8hr) remaining on 4 days of sick and vacation, which will equal eight hour days, and we can calculate the amount of time in number of days using (8*64)/24, which is 8.33 days.\n\nHence total number of hours available over the years = 8.33 (D)\n\nSo the final answer: 192 hours on each day.\n\n\nInput:A teacher has a student with a learning disability.

The statement that they crowd onto a scale says that they are standing near the scale and the scale is showing 3 readings. \n3. Since Jim weighs 8 more pounds than Stan, Stan weighs 5 fewer pounds than Steve, and Steve weighs less than Jim, we can solve the 3 readings based on these weight relationships.\n4. Since the total weight is the weight of the 3 people, we can calculate it from the 3 readings by applying addition and subtraction as needed.\n5.

The second part constitutes of the rest of the travel time to complete all the remaining errands.\n3. Let us calculate separately the distance traveled in the first part and the distance travelled in the second part.\n4. Tony's drive from his house to the grocery store and back is 10 miles. This leaves 60 minutes for Tony in total for the grocery store.\n5. Tony's drive to the doctor's appointment takes 5 miles. This leaves 55 minutes for Tony in total.\n6. The total time he takes to complete his first errand is 60 + 55 = 115 minutes.\n7. And the drive from the grocery store to the haircut takes a total of 15 miles. This leaves the remaining 30 minutes of the time Tony needs for the first errand.\n8. And this 30 minutes Tony can again use for the doctor's appointment while he is actually on the way from the grocery to the barber.\n9.

This could indicate that the bus had a capacity of 240 people, as it was carrying more than 75% of its capacity.\n\nSecond, we are provided the information that another 4/5 of the capacity was taken up on the return trip (200/1.4 = 142.9% = 4/3).

However, option A: \"Natural\" could be misleading and give a false impression that his death was natural or due to natural causes, such as an illness or accident.\n\n5. Option B: \"Reasonable\" implies that the death may be reasonable to some extent, but not necessarily. \n\n6.\"Unusual\" or \"unbelievable\" might suit the phrase as well.\n\n7.\"Unusual\" is generally used to describe something that is not customary or not typical, which could fit the description of an unusual or uncommon cause of death.\n\n8.\"Unreasonable\" may not be the best choice, as it could imply that the cause of death was inappropriate or unjustified, which may be a sensitive or negative interpretation.\n\n9.

A total of 100 apples will be used, since there is no leftover money.\n\n5.) Because one fourteenth of an apple is a sour apple, this means that one fourteenth of one hundred apples is 7 apples.\n\n6.) The apples are sliced into one quarter, which equals 100 for one apple and 7 equals seven. This means that sweet apples produce seven apples.\n\n7.) We subtract three from seven to give us 4 sweet apples. We use the remaining money of $1500 to replace the sour ones, and since only sour apples are replaced, the same amount is not used for the whole apple.\n\n8.)

{"text": "1: Here the key is the following statement: \"If the plumber charges $50 to fix one toilet\u2026\". \n2: This statement suggests that the cost to the plumber for any toilet is $50. All costs are to be considered as fixed costs, as no plumber charges any price depending on how many toilets he repairs on any day. \n3: Hence, the least number of toilets to be repaired in any of the chosen three work sites is two, as the cost to the plumbers will exceed the income that is earned by repairing only 2 units out of a 5 toilets. \n4: If the plumber charges three different prices for fixing a toilet, sink and shower, the formula to maximize his income (in dollars) when he is able to repair three different work sites, and each site has a different number of toilets, sinks and showers is:  \n\n(2 * 3 * 30) + (2 * 5 * 40) + (2*3*50) = $300 + 200 + 1000 = $1500\n\n5: However, if the plumber can only choose one of the 3 jobs, then all variables are fixed based on the cost to him. The plumber can no longer opt for the 2nd or 3rd job. So, he is left with only the first job, i.e. the one that involves 3 toilets and 3 sinks. \n\n6: The total cost in this case is:  \n(3 * 2 * 60) + (3 * 1 * 50) + (3*2* 80) = $180 + 150 + 240 = $610\n\n7: Hence, the correct answer for the problem is A:  3 toilets and  3 sinks + $610 (i.e. maximum earned income)\nSo the final answer was A: 3 toilets  and 3 sinks (not shower)\n\nInput: The following formula is used to find the value of x in the equation 5x \u2013 2 = 6.

{"text": "169.70 The question asks how much did Donna pay in total after buying the porcelain vases and after paying sales tax.\n\n2. The amount that Donna paid in original, list price is given as $200.\n\n3. The sales price before tax is 0.9 times the list price, or 0.9 times $200. This is calculated by multiplying the list price of the porcelain vats by 0.9. This is used to determine sales tax. In this case, the sales tax amount is 0.5*(sales price), where the sales price is listed above.\n4. To calculate the total amount that Donna paid, the sales tax should be added to the sales price.  This is because the sales tax is a cost.\n\n5. To calculate the sales tax amount, you multiply the sales price by tax percentage, which is 0.8. Then, you multiply by 100, which rounds the decimal to 2 with two significant digits. The resultant amount is 10 percent of the sales price, which is 0,80.\n6. Using the rounded tax amount of 0,80, we combine it with the sales price, 0.90*200, to get the total amount that Donella paid. The combined value is 200+0,8+0,80=169.7 in total.

{"text": "1: The question is asking how many students will be attending school physically and not virtually on a given day, given the pandemic-related circumstances. It is important to note that the question is not about how many students attend school in general, but specifically for a portion of school days.\n\n2: To determine the percentage of students present in school on a given day, we can use a proportion, which relates the number of students in school with the total number of students. In this scenario, the number of students present in school and the total number of students would be in proportion.\n\n3: Let's first calculate the total number of students, which is given as \\(40\\%\\) of the student population. We can express this as \\(40 \\times (100)\\) using the proportion symbol \\(\\frac{.\\)\n\n4: Then, let's find the number of students present on that given day. We can write this as \\(x \\times (10\\%)\\). Here \\(40\\%\\) is a fraction representing the number of students present, and \\(10\\%\\) is the proportion of students present at school. Inserting these values, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n40 \\times ( 100)\\quad \t\tx\\times ( 10) \\\\\n= 4000 \\quad x  = 400 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n5: Next, we can write a solution for the problem. To do so, we can use proportions to multiply.\n\n$$\n\\frac{x}{40} = 10 \\\\\n\\therefore x = 10 \\times 40 \\\\\n= 4 \\ \\ \\text{students} \\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn terms of percentages, this means that \\(40\\%\\) represents 400 of a total of 1000 students, and the number of students present is 4/1000 or 0.04\\% of that same total.\n\nSo finally, the answer is that \\(4.0 \\times 100\\%\\) of students are present in class at a given time during the given circumstance.\nSo the final question is 40%\nSo the final answer 40%\n \nInput: A frog swam for", "answer": " 30"}

Choices: 1: 2 2: 4 3: 5 4: 10 5: nothing\nOutput:There are two ways to solve this problem. \n\nWe can use the divisibility test and a number of other tricks to quickly determine if a particular number is indeed divisible by another.\n\nFor example, let's say that we want to know if the number 14 is divisible by the number 5. We can divide 5 into itself a few times, and then see if any of those values are divisible by 14.\n\nFor example 4 divided by 5 gives you 0.8 because 5 goes into 4 once leaving you with a reminder of 0, 4/5 is equal to 0.8, because as we just said, 5 goes into 14 a multiple of 5 times.\n\nAnother easy way of solving this problem is to simply count the 1's and 5's in the divisor. You have 2 1's so it can be divided by 9, 2 5's, so it is divisible by 5, and 0 2's, so that is also divisible by", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "180 - 41 = 139\nSo the correct answer is 139\n\nInput: Which is better to cook with on a camping trip; propane or charcoal? Choices: \nOutput:\n\n1. Charcoal is usually considered easier to work with than propane when camping. Charcoal burns longer than propane, and it's easier to control the temperature with charcoal.\n\n2. Propane burns more quickly than charcoal and is less difficult to control compared to charcoal due to lower combustible gases, which makes it less challenging to build a flame.  Because propane-fueled camping stoves require less monitoring than propane stoves, they are generally preferable.\n3. Hence, choice B: propane is the best answer to the question.\nSo the final answers is B.\n\nInput: The manager, feeling overwhelmed by the tasks at hand, has not been concentrating on other members of the staff or their projects. How should the lead organize this team with a deadline only a few days away? Choices:  One: Increase production by delegating some of her tasks to members of the team. Two: Take on extra tasks so other team members can take some of their own work. Three: Ask one team member to take on tasks from at least four different team members One, Two, and Three. \nOutput: The manager is not concentrating on their tasks, so they need to focus on their own.  The best way to increase their productivity is by reducing the burden of tasks that they hold. Option one states to delegate duties and responsibilities to her team to reduce her duties. She can delegate tasks until she has time to focus on her own duties. Option two states that the manager should focus on her own tasks instead of taking on extra work. This will increase her concentration on her priority project and reduce anxiety by reducing distractions. When concentrating on her own duties, she will need less time to focus on other projects, which she can delegate or give up so other team members can concentrate on their own. Option three states that she should distribute responsibilities to as many team members as possible. Doing so will leave no room for responsibility and allow the manager to focus on her own tasks. Option A is best.", "answer": " 98"}

{"text": "1) Given the following information:\n\nFrank bakes two 12 cookie trays each day, for six days. He tastes one cookie each day to ensure that it tastes good. Ted comes over and consumes four trays of cookies on the last day.\n\n2)We can break down the problem as follows:\n\n(Six trays * Frank + One tray * Frank) = (12 - 1)*6 + 1\n\n3)When we add all of these together and subtract 6 from both sides, we get a 7*2 - 6 = 8 and -3\n\n4)Solving both sides of that equation gives 11 - 4 = 7\n\n5)Each tray holds 12 cookies, so that means that if Frank eats one, there are two cookies left.\n\n6)If on top of that, Ted takes 4 trays, then there are 84 cookies left.\n\n7)In total, there are 95 or 96 cookies left.\n\nSo the final answer will be E: 95 or 6\n\nInput: Which one are we most likely to have trouble with: A) a 1000 piece puzzle B) a 6000 piece puzzlem C) a 30 piece puzzle\nOutput: 1: The question is asking us to select the item that will be most difficult to assemble.\n\n2: All three of the given options would take varying amounts of time to piece together.

{"text": "1: 40 times Susannah went to swim, while Camden went 26 times. \n2. Let x be the number of times Camden went swimming per week. \n3. There are 4 weeks. \n\n4. So x would be 4/40 or 1/10. \n5. If x=1/10, then Camden went swimming only 5 times a week because it is impossible to divide the total number of times (26) by 0.1. \n6. 5+16=21. \n7. If x=16/40, then Camden would have to have gone to swim for a total of 8+16=24 days, which is possible. \n8. Since Susannah also went to swimming for about the same number of days, 8+16, then Camden must have gone to swim on fewer days by 1-8=7 days. \n9. 8+16-7=24, which is the number of days that Susannah went to the pool. Therefore, Susannah went to pool 1 more time than Camden per week.\nSo the final answers are 40 times Susanna went swimming, which was 16 times per week.\nSo Camden went swimming 5 times per week.\nFinally, if x=16/80, then x=1/4, which means that Camden went swimming once every 4 days while Susannah swam every day on average.\nSo the final final answer is Camden went swimming ONCE EVERY FOUR DAYS than Susannah swims per week.", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "1. Lydia has a pool that holds 60 gallon of water, and she's filling the pool using a garden hose that provides 1 gallon of water per minute. \n\n2. The pool is a cylinder shape, so its volume is pi*h2*(l/2), where h is the diameter of the pool and l is the length of the pool. In this case, the height is half of the diameter, and Lydia should use (pi*h2)/2*1.6 to calculate how long it would take her to fill the pool. \n3. A small hole is leaking water at a rate of about 0.1 gallon per minute. To account for this, we must substract (0.1 gallon)/(1.6 gallon) from the previously calculated number to correct for the small hole. The answer after doing this is 60 gallons / 0.564 gallons/min = 108.972 \n7. Hence, Lydia should take 108.72 minutes (108 minutes and 48 seconds) to fill the pool as there is a small leak.

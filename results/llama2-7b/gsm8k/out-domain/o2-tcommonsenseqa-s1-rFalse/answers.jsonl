{"text": "356  \n\nInput: The library holds 356 books. You check out 10 books. You check out an additional 5 books. The library now has 320 books. How many books did you take out?\nOutput:15\n\n#### Solution:\n\nThere are 356 books in a library and 10 books are checked out.We know that the total books at the library are '356', and we also know that 'only' 'k' books are checked out. The total number of books in the library should be equal to '356 -  k' books because '10' books are checked out and 'k' books are also checked out.'k' represents the number of books that are checked out. Therefore,\nk = 355  \nWe replace 'k' to '355' to obtain '355+10'  \nThus, k + k + k + 10 =355\nSubstitute k = 355, then the left equation is equal to 450, therefore 355+15= 355+ 355/4 is 355+355/4=610/2. Then the total books left in the library is 610.\n\n\nInput:A clock on a wall says its 5:59:04. In a minute, it strikes 6.

However, because it is counting down, it will be 5:55 and in the next 9 seconds, it would become 5:46, and then 5:37, and so on. Thus, it would turn the clock back to 5:50 and it would reach 5:59 after 89 seconds in total.\n\n\n\n#### ## Instruction:\nAnswer the following logic math question in a worded or written format.

She leaves her dog outside whilst she steps into her house. When she gets back out to the back garden, her dog is standing on his hind legs, and staring in horror at something. The owner asks him what he can see - and he points towards their back gate. She walks over to the gate and knocks on it, looking inside it, and asking if somebody is there. She gets no response. The dog's reaction indicates that somebody was there moments before and is still there now. The dog's owner is not fooled by this - she knows that a person at the back gate right now would have reacted differently had anybody been on their property. The dog's observation is correct: somebody was at the gate when the dog's owner was home, however, they have since left. The gate is currently locked, and the dog's owner doesn't have the key. They can't go into the house either (since somebody may still be inside), and they can't go back into the yard (because of the locked gate). Whoever was there before was somebody they knew (i.e. they wouldn't have tried to break in) but who still could not have gotten in.

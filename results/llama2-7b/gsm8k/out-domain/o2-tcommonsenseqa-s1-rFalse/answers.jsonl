Therefor car insurance cost will have the highest change during that year, and the amount of car insurance will have the highest.

Choices:\n\t\t\n\t \n\nThe HCAI Human Centric Artificial Intelligence is a new computer science and data science concept that will drive the next generation of computerized system development. One of the most important concepts emerging from HCAI is the idea that many of the tasks that humans perform everyday are actually tasks for which machines can do a better job.\n\nThe challenge, of course, is identifying these tasks and creating systems that automatically perform them in a much more effective and efficient way. \n\nThe new concept of HCAI is more than a paradigm shift from the current artificial intelligence approaches of machine learning and neural networks. HCAI is fundamentally changing how we approach the development of computerized systems. Instead of applying AI to a wide variety of tasks for which the application is unknown, HCAI is focused on a human task. It does this by taking into account the human factors of that task (such as our emotions and intentions).\n\nThe purpose of HCAI is not simply to automate a task, but to create a machine that is more human-like.

{"text": "### Demostration:\nFirst, the statement is, Max has 8 children. In an array, we can use an index between 0 and n - 1 for each element to be accessed. Therefore, n = 8.\nThis means the array must have length n = number of elements in the array.\nI will call the length of the array: n = 8. Therefore, the length of the array must be n = 8. Since we are told, each of his children has n = 8 children, the children are added together to form an array of length n = 8. An array of length n =8. \n\nThere are 8 spots in the array where we can store elements. To be able to assign these elements the elements must exist in a range from 0 to 8. Each time a element can be indexed this means each element has a range of 0 to n - 1. We can use a binary representation of the element by using a sum of the product of the number of elements starting at 0 that make up the element. In our case, there are 8 elements that make up an element's value. This gives us a range of 0-15. Now, in binary representation it is 16-10. If we add 10 to 16 it is: the range is: 26 -10 = n  = 8. This means the size of the array is 8.\n\nNext, each of his children. Since we are told each of his children has 8 children. The children in this array will make up the set of children of Max. These children are the only children that will be in the array. The children of Max will be stored in the children of Max array. Each of these children will now be the children of Max.\n\nNow, with that in mind, each of his children, will need assigned to a location in the children of Max, array.\n\nThe key to this question is knowing the number of children that Max has. \n\nMax has 8 children.\n\nWe know that each of Max's children has 8 children each.\n\nThis means the max has 8 children, and each of his children, have 8 children each.

{"text": "Answer: You want to calculate the probability of both cases happening with the chance of winning.  There's a 70% chance of losing one of them.  Let p equal the chance of winning.\n    P(both) = 1/(1-p) = 60%/55% = 1.0925 \n    p = 0.00765  \n   \nThen you want to compare this probability with the chance of losing.  70% of the time you'll lose them.  Therefore, you take 1 and subtract this probability.  0.0425 = 9.751\n    1 - 0.042 - 0.0975\n   \nThere is a 4.2245 multiplier on the chance of losing them.

She spents a quarter of what she spends money to on in-game purchese.

If a task needs to be processed in a logical and mathematical way, then it's important to determine how the data is being processed to come up with an appropriate algorithm or coding structure.\n\nThese are the most common logical and mathematical thinking tasks that we see today within the AI environment:\n\n-  Fits the input range to the pattern of a formula. For example, a formula represents the sequence of integer values of the input range so it's easy to use that formula to test whether the value range inputs match the pattern.\n-  Logical thinking is a process of deductive thinking where the input is a set of conditions, then that set of conditions will determine what will be the result of the solution.\n-  Math logic to test whether the input value is a multiple of another input value.\n-  Math calculation to determine what the output will be from the input.\n-  Determining whether an input is greater than some other value.\n\nBelow is an example of a programming coding sample that is used to test whether the number is odd or even:\n\n```\n\n```\n\n## What is the purpose of logic thinking for AI and Computer systems?\n\nLogic thinking and logic operations are important in understanding how the AI systems work. These AI applications are based on a lot of conditionals and if-then-else logical statements to determine what inputs would process, or how outputs for a function would return the result.\n\nThese logic operations are used widely and they are important for the coding process:", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "The first thing she will do when painting is getting all of her equipment. She's not going to start painting. Next she needs to get her walls painted. Therefore she only needs to paint three bedrooms. I'll start by showing you the math. The first step is to determine the height of the walls. In this case it is 9 feet. Next multiply the height and the width of the walls. In Henrietta's case her length is 11 feet (22 feet total). Finally divide the paint capacity with the total amount of work that must be painted. Therefore she will need 3.25 gallons. If she were using a 2 gallon paint pail I would round the 3.25 down to 3.\n\n### Input\nA 40 square inch plate sits on top of a 22 inch diameter plate. How many inches is the amount of space in between the outer edge of the small plate and the small plate?\n\n### Demostration\n\nThe plate is a quarter of the way around the larger plate. In this scenario the height is less important than the width. However, we must know that the first plate is 22 inches around. If the first plate is 40 inches, the second plate is 2 inches. The first plate is 2 inches taller than it is wide. Therefore, if I have the first plate 1 inch wide, and want to know the height, then I need to divide 22 by 12. If the second plate is 3/4 of the way around it. If you multiply the 19 by.75 you get 14.25. That is 14 1/4. The 22 inch plate is the same amount as the 19 inch plate.\n\n### Response\nI'm going to work the question for you to let you know what you are looking for. The first plate that the 40 square incher sits on is 22 inches. There is space for 11 inches of an 11 inch plate. The next plate that 40 sits on is 9 inches in diameter and the 22 inch circle is the same size. There is space for a space of 8.925 inches. Since the inner circle is 8.92 inches.

{"text": "Ben can build 14 chairs in 10 days.  The time required to build 1 chair (T1) and how many chairs to complete in 10 days (T2) can be written as \nT1 = 5\nand\nT2 = 10\nUsing the PEMDAS rule of order of operations, the value of the two expressions can be combined to find the value of this equation:\nT1T2 = 1\nTo find the value of T1T2, you can divide 1 by 10. This equals 0.1 because you found the total value of T2 divided by the order of T2, which is 10. Since you divide 0.1 by T1, which is 5, your answer of 14 is determined by the remainder.\n\n### Input\nA school class must choose 3 people for a trip.  The class size is 25.  How many ways can 3 people be selected from the class? Choices: A:10.9B:12.3C:17.4D:3.3E:0.6\n\n### Response\nA:10.9 can be selected.  You can count the number of ways in one of two ways: you can factor all of the ways.  It's important to remember that when you use the PEMDAS order of operations you can use it to find the value of any simple algebra equation.  You can find your answer by finding the coefficient of A in the top row: 1 (because it's a number) 1(25) (because it's an integer) and -1(+1) (because it'll be placed backward by subtraction).  This is your answer because you only subtracted or added one term and it equals a 10.9 in the coefficient.\n\n### Question\nWhen is 2.5 less than 2.3?\n\n### Answer\nWhen 2.3 is divided by 2.5, the result is 0.923068 which is less than 0.92.

Plumbing refers to the water pipes in a house. Thus, the 5 answer options are a,b,c,d,e respectively.\n\n- The second sentence (2) says 'When a person is beginning work they aren't doing work yet'. So the answer is a.\n\n- For the third sentence (3), there are 5 answer options like this one and the following two. However the first 2 options are more likely to be guessed, thus we would prefer to choose the last two answer options. The answer should be d.\n\nNow lets calculate how many minutes Carolyn spends practicing the piano for 2 weeks which is 80 minutes(22 hours)\n\nWe multiply the above answer by 2 because she practices 20 minutes a da. Thus the total hours she spends playing the piano for 80 minutes is equal to 40 minutes. Since week 1 contains 7 days and week 2 contains 6 days we simply multiply 40 minutes by 4/7 and 6/7  respectively. Thus the total minutes of piano practice is equal to 56 minutes for week 1 and 60 minutes for week 2, which makes the total minutes for a month equal to 116.  Now for violin, we multiply total hours Carolyn spends practing by 3 (because she practies violin for three times more than piano for the same amount of time) and subtracts the total hours she spents practicing piano from the total hours she spennd practicing violin.  This gives us total hours of her violin practice is 672 minutes which makes the answer to question C.\n\n### \ud83c\udf93 Solution:\n\nThe first", "answer": " 1920"}

{"text": "If we let $R=2/3$ (2/3 as the ratio) and $6$ (as the median) from the statement, then $R*6=0$. The rest, we let $S=4$ (as the median). $S(1-R)=(0)(1-R)=6-R$. Therefore, $S+R+R*S=6+(0)+1=5+(1-R)$ which is $3+(1-R)$ or $3+1-(1-R)$ or $(2+(1-R)-)$ which is $(2+(1-)$ (2+1-2)-) or $(2+1)-)$ which is $(3)-)$ or $4$.\n\n### Input 2:\nA Statistics professor is curious about the weight of the freshmen students in a particular college.

By the central limit theorem, we have 1) $\\sqrt{n}X=\\frac{X(n-1)}{n}$ 2) $\\sqrt{n}(\\frac{X(n+1)}{n})=t$ 3) $T=X-\\mu$\nThus, $n \\mu=152$ by setting $X$ equal to $n*\\mu$, we have $1) \\sqrt{n}X=152$ which is $137.2$ according to this website (http://www.chepstow.co.uk/calculators/normal-distribution-central-limit-theorem/ ). After simplifying the expression, to make it more reasonable to read, we have $137.32-0.05=137.27$ \nand then $137.13*1.36/(137.2)^2=-0.97$ and $2)=152.37+1.96*-0.97=57.25$, and then $3", "answer": " 320"}

{"text": "2\n### Justification: There are 3 categories of time: time spent lifting weight, time spent warming up, and time spent doing cardio.\n* A person can spend a maximum of 1 hour lifting weight (there are 3 lifting portions a day each equaling one hour)\n* 1/3 of your weightlifting time is dedicated to warming up, which can be the same time duration as it takes to warm up from walking, so the number of hours spent doing warming up is equal to three times the duration of walking to the gym.\n* 1/5 of weightlifting time would be allocated for cardio, which equals 3 times the length of time it takes to walk back from cardio.\nSo it takes 3 times the walk plus it takes 3 times to walk in, making a total of 2 times the walk. Because of this, we could find the number of hours being spent at the gym to be 2 hours.", "answer": " 4"}

Using this formula (320 lbs / 7 days = 45 lbs x (5 + 1)) Joy would need to feed 283 lbs of dog food. \n\n### Input The formula for figuring out the amount of acreage a field can produce is Area = Pi (diameter of circle that represents area) X (circumference of the area) \n\n### Response My response would be \"I have no idea what the solution to that equation is. I know it's Pi, but it's not Pi X (circumference that represents area). Someone please tell me what it is! I'm guessing it's Pi X (area that represents a circle), but I'm not sure.\" \n\n### Output \n\n### My Answer: I have no idea what your answer is. I know the formula to find how many pounds of dog food to feed the dogs but I have no idea what to do with the other one. Someone please help!", "answer": " 57"}
{"text": "The red can travel at twice the green, so 16 miles per hour.  That means the green car can travel at 16 times 8, which equals 128 miles per hour.  If the broken car, blue, can travel at 80 miles per hours, then we subtracted the 80 miles per second that the broken one can travel at from 128 miles.  Therefore, the other two sports cars can travel at over 100 miles per hour.\n\n### Input\n\nWe have some money and are choosing between 2 different stores.  The store with more items available has a total of 900 items.  The other store has 800, which leaves 600 for the first store.  Does it make us, mathematically, to pick the store that has the more items, even without knowing the price of the items? Just give us a simple answer, yes no, or whatever your feel would be helpful for this task.\n\n### Response\n\nWhat you are asking me is a very specific math question, so if I didn't understand the task, I would ask for you to explain it a little further.  If you want to take both stores prices and just figure out if the first store would be better, then yes, it would be better.  If their prices were the same, then I wouldn't know, however based on logic, it would be.  If the first store had twice as many items, however, then their prices would be twice as much as the second store.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis question was asked on our group interview.  When the recruiter asked this mathematical reasoning question, I actually asked her if she knew the answer to the question, since it was kind of wordy, and she responded that it depended on the amount of items available. Then I told her that she wasn't asking me to answer the question, but only to tell me if it was in my comfort zone or not.", "answer": " 1280"}

In the question above, player had to input $1,680 which can be found in \"16\". Because of that, player have to find correct number from 1 to 16.\nThen player should use subtraction math operation such that the cost of vase is in $182.4.\n\n##### In what order should you complete this task?\nIn this program, the task are complete from the same order. We use a step that require the player to type first. That is because step is not finished until the player can type 100% correctly and the task should be finish with a step that require the correct answer to be written.\n\n##### What are any of the challenges you faced in completing this request?\nIn this program that we developed, there were 2 challenges that I faced. The first challenged I faced was in step 5. In this step, there is not any rule that require the player to enter the $ if a number less than $1 is entered such as in the question $11.80. In this case, there are a lot of mistakes that the player had made and we could not correct them because at that time the program was not ready to run. The second challenge that I faced was on step 7. In this step, the program only allow 2 decimal places and it is a big mistake in our view and we didn't know how to fix this problem and it is also the problem the player face in this program.\n\n##### How will you modify this task in the future? (Please consider things like additional steps, changing the order, etc.)\nThere are a lot of different option that we can apply to this program in the future. First, the player can put a condition like \"If the player enters an incorrect number, the program will enter a condition which says 'try again'\". Second, player can be asked to enter other type of cost like miles that need to be covered or the price of the item.

{"text": "25\n\n### Rationale:Nick now has 35 quarts. 2/5 of them is 13 and 25% of the state quarters is 13, and 50% of 13 is 6.  Therefore he has 6 quarters.  To add these to the 13 quarters gives 19, and 35 divided by 2 is 17.5, so now he has 19 quarters.  So 50% of that is 10 and 5/10th of 10 is 5, and 6 + 5 is 11.  Now 11 is 2/5 of 22.  So now he has 22 quarters (16 + 6) and 1/5 of that equals 4.  Now we have 16 + 4, 20 quarters.  We divide that by 5 and get 4. Now we  have 4 + 6 because he also has 6 state quarters.  Finally we divide that by 2 to find out if his guess of 21 is correct and it is.", "answer": " 7"}

In decimals, 45.6 is close enough enough to 45.6, so we say that Angie drank 45.6 milliliters/cup/day, and she drank 6/day (just say it, don't write it down). 6 divided by 45.6 equals.13 cups/day. 0.13 multiplied by 3 gives us 0.39 or 0.4 cups/day (45.6 + 5.6 = 51.2, which we round down to)\n\nIn all, Angie will drink her whole supply in 747 days, or 2.23 years.\n\n### Input\n\nGracie had 24 peanuts.

So that's $12,0x5 equals $60,000 in revenue by the end of the work week. The restaurant then doubles its amount of revenue for every weekend in the month which equals $28,8x2 equals $57,600. The total amount of revenue by the end the month is $57,6x2 equals $115,200. This is the final total revenue before any costs.\n\nInput:You earn $500 a week at work and have an hour commute each way.

In fact, let's try a demonstration with 3 as the factor and the 90 minutes you have as the time. We already know Tom can read 10 pages of a book in 90 minutes because we know he can read 12 in an hour.

{"text": "**Answer:** 108.0 kilograms\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nFor the current usage of 90 kilogram * 6 months in a year, we get 540 kilogram. Therefore, 540/90 (to get the current ratio) = 6. \nIt means by 6 times the current rate of using grapes, Borris must increase his grapes consumption. So we get an answer of 540/6 = 90 kilogram * 2 (times to increase use of grapes) = 180 kilogram/month * 6 months = 108. It means Borris must increase his usage of consuming grapes by 20% which will cause an answer of 108.\n\n\n### Submit your work to `submit.py` in the `train` directory to complete the training.

She could buy 2 VIP tickttes at $100, but she decides instead to buy 2 regular tickets at $75 each. So, she buys 2 regular tickets (not VIP) at $75 each and $100 is left over. Now, there's $50 from each regular ticket. Then she buys 3 regular tickets, so there are $4 each left over. In total, she paid $75 for 2 regular tickets and $4 for 3 regular tickets. She purchased a VIP ticket for $100. That brought her spending limit (which was $1000) down to $741 and the remaining money for spending was $647. With that, she bought 3 regular tickets for $4 each since there was $4 in change and $100 for 2 VIP ticketes.\n\n### Exercise 11.1:\n\n![exercise 11 1](assets/images/exercise_11_1.png)\n\n### Experiment:\n\n### Discussion 11.1\n\nIn this exercise, we saw how to use our calculators when need be, but if we don't know how to do certain math problems, we were able to find someone who could.

It requires time to return to a working state, which is when one can do work again.  When one returns to work, that is a new state.  When one has returned to a working state, but doesn't want to lift heavy again yet, that is the state of returning to a working state after injury.  The state of returning to a non-working state is when the task is complete, so one returns to the non-working state after 3 weeks if that state lasted 3 days.

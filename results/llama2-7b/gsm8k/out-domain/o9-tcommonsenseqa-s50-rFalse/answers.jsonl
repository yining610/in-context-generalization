{"text": "257\n<span class=\"text-danger\">Answer</span>\n\n\n<hr/>\n\n<a name=\"how-to-answer-the-question\"></a></br>\nYou might have been wondering how to handle the task. I'll tell you here!\n\n-First, you need to understand the question and think about all possible words associated with it. For example, in the word: \"Do you feel like playing football?\" Your first idea could be *play*. That's good! However, thinking about the question, you can easily realize that there are other words as well that should be considered (playing, football, like, feeling,). All of them can be used with the same question!\n-Second, you need to make sure you don't use duplicate words since it will affect the output. In the previous question, the duplicate word that can negatively interfere with the output is \"university\".\n-Third, you need to ensure all the question part is removed (like in the *Do you feel like playing the football?* question.\n-Fourth, once you have a list of good words (you can get this by using the words I mentioned above), replace each word with one of the good words.\n-Fifth, check all the replaced words to ensure they make sense. Since I just used words with the same meaning to substitute, you might get *C: football* instead of *C: park*. I don't know much about football, so I used the closest I could think of.\n\nI've just added a lot of text to the question. I wrote *C: football* for *C: park* since I personally do not know the difference between those two. So in this example, the answer should be *E: hockey game* (to be fair, this is the only answer that has \"hockey\" in it).\n\n<hr/> \n\n\n<a name='challenge-03-output-and-scoring'></a>\n\n<a name ='challenge-03.output-and-scores'></a><br/>\n\n**Output** and **Scoring**: There is a score on top of each question which is the most important thing. A higher score indicates a better answer which means that it had fewer mistakes, was unique and well thought of.", "answer": " 1080"}

{"text": "$3500\n\nPlease read the following question first and think for a moment and come up with a solution. The question is on the second page to be answered below it.\nI have two rectangular boxes: one box contains one marble and the other has 2 marbles. The probabilities that it is in those boxes at random are 1/6 to the first box and 1/4 to the other box. \nWe then flip a coin and observe whether or not it is in the box selected by the coin flip.\nAfter removing it, we flip another coin. If it is in the same box, it remains, and we flip again. Otherwise it goes to another box. \nHow many steps is needed on average to get it back to the original box. \nMy solution was to assume that the first box is A and the other box is B. Then we can use the geometric distribution to get f(x) = (1/2)*(1/6)^x\nAnd since we know we've gotten it back to the original position (notice I assume the boxes are the same size, or it will be impossible without the assumption), we know it can take at least x+1 steps. So the expectation is x/(x+1)\n\nCan the solution be improved or can you come up with a better reasoning for this?", "answer": " 5250"}

Tourists often find themselves so taken in by the powerful waterfall that they get dangerously close to the edge. When they stand too close, they fall to their death. This has happened on several occasions in the last century (about 6,200 people have died near the falls).  There are a few reasons why visitors stand so close to the falls. First, the surrounding area is so steep that they feel safe standing where they are. They may also be attracted to the views and water spray around the falls. Lastly, people are simply captivated by the spectacle. A similar phenomenon is known to occur at the waterfalls in South Africa, which people stand on and take unauthorized selfies. People die at these falls as well, and tourists have caused damage to the surrounding natural habitat.\n\nWhy do tourists stand so close to the waterfalls? Which of the following is NOT one of the reasons?\nChoices:  A:  They believe it is safe to stand in the water. B:  They are attracted to the waterfall. C:  They have been influenced by social media. D:  They do not anticipate the dangers of this location.\nOutput: D:  They do NOT anticipate the dangers.", "answer": " 7"}

How much money did you earn?\nOutput:43\n### The result of the test question here:\n\n### My own explanation here:\n*For the first problem, the correct answer is park since the player who punched another went to 'penalty box' which means a box for penalty which means they are in a 'box' in which there is no nature or green plants or nature and the park is a 'green' area since in a park, there are many trees, grass, and many 'green' things and also, there are many activities that can be done in the park.\n\n*for the second one, the right answer is hockey since a foul means punching another player on the face which is not allowed to be in the right sporting event, sigh means tired because the breath cannot help the body to move since the breath cannot help in any activities that involve movements of the body which is why it may be sick, tunnel means a place to store things, and transportation system means a place where people can be transported from one place to another which is not appropriate.\n\n*for third, the right answer is spectacles. It was written, 'he was not doing housework,' which means the player was doing sports. Since spectacles only need to be worn to read, it is the only one that needs to be worn.\n\n*for fourth, the right answer is 'group students'. It was written 'begin projects for students'. If students will be working in a project, it is better that they be grouped together.\n\n*for fifth, the right answer is a strip mall. It was written'medical building' and 'hospital' both. In my personal point of view, what I know is if there is a medical building or a hospital, it is near them.\n*for sixth, it was written 'do many things'. There are more dogs and they can have lots of actions which can be categorized to 'do many things'.\n*for the last one, the right answer should be the toy store. For me, I think if you want to buy a bicycle for children, the best place to get it would be in a toy", "answer": " 27"}

The rest of the questions were more open-ended but were still fair in their grade system. But, you could definitely improve that by giving examples of the grade system by example such as the grade of the first multiple choice \"Where do humans go in cities -\" could be answered A: park, B: movie theatre, C: alaska, D: university, E: country or even better, you could just make the example questions more complicated in their explanation and have the answers be closer to the questions such as A: movie theatre, B: country, C: alaska...etc.\n* The first two questions that were more open were:\n    \"Where does a dentist go to school in cities?\".\n        \n    \"What is the best sports car?\".", "answer": " 26"}

For example, I could make my way to my place of business, and then, if I got tired or was uncomfortable, have the taxi take me up to my place of business anyway. Similarly, at a large party, it might be easier to just ride in a taxi, instead of trying to locate all the people in the building and invite them home and make sure they all get home. But if I got tired or uncomfortable, it would still be easier to have someone call me a taxi back to my place of business. And at an airport, taxiing is much easier, if not faster, than walking. But at a train station, there are no trains to get to; all you do is get onto another train.\n\nThe above examples are of course for the use of a taxi; but, just as one would call up a taxi to avoid walking up staircases, or taking one another's cars home from a party, one might take a bus or the subway or even walk whenever possible for reasons of the environmental impact of automobiles, and just as if one must go everywhere by bus or the subway, a person might use a scooter or a bicycle or walk everywhere.\n\nHow does the environmental impact of taking a taxi differ from that of using a public transportation service for the same distance traveled?

Then we'll assign as a 0 all position that contain a 1 of the previous matrix.

{"text": "600\n\nInput: In the equation above, c is the original number of cars registered and s is the total number of cars registered after the first 20 days. How many cars do we expect to remain on the road after 90 days, according to the equation?\nOutput: approximately 9 c\nExplanation:  Because this is a binomial distribution and the standard deviation of this equation is 6, s + 9c will be near a normal curve:\n\n1. We will continue to multiply s by d for the first 20-period equation.\n2. After that point, we will subtract s by c and multiply that amount by d.\n3. This means that our s+9c would be 5x10000 = 50x20000 = around 50 * 20000, a large value.\n\nInput: In what sense did the number of cars registered differ after the first fourteen days from the number registered after the next 120 days.\nOutput: After 14 days of registration the number of cars differed by 15 whereas after 120 days the number of cars differing between the two time periods were 9.\n\nExplanation: Since we can use the standard deviation of the binomial distribution equation to get the value of 9, then the 9 will become the same value after 120.\n\nInput:In how many ways can we distribute the items among 10 boxes, if 3 items must go into each box? \nOutput: (5 choose 3)\nExplanation: We can distribute the items by using 5!/3! ways, which represents any number of ways to distribute objects among 3 slots. Since the three items are forced to put into each slot, the number of ways a person can distribute the items are all equal!\n\nInput:How much money did the company make? The company earned (5a+4b). The company made $101.17 from item a and item b. \nOutput: 5a + 4b = 5(a+b) + 4a\nSince 5 is multiplied by the answer of b, the formula should result in 25, since that equals to $101.85.", "answer": " 75"}

Given E=3 x 10^5 in-lb, a=3 in per ft, L=12 ft, and w=6 in. What is the magnitude of the tension in the bar?\nOutput: tension = 3310 lb.\n\n--- Explanation:\nThe first step in this question is to convert the given inches into the unit that we\ncan use to solve this question (the SI unit is N and you can convert the provided\nunits into this unit by following the formula given by the NIST: https://www.nist.gov/glossary/si-units-money.\n\nYou can solve for the tension in two steps:\n\nStep1:\n\nDetermine the force, since force=weight, and to determine the weight from the given\ninformation, we need to know the weight per unit area which is available from the SI\nunit of weight: 1 N= 10^3 kg/m or 1e-3 kg/mm.\n\nDetermine density, which is defined as mass/volume and it is given by:\n\u03c1 = mass / volume\n\nDetermine volume since volume = cross-sectional area * length.\n\nDetermining cross-sectional area = 6 * 12 + [12/5](12-6)=48 +18 =66.\n\n\u03c1 = weight/volume = 10^5 / 66 = 150 kg/m^3\n\nW= \u03c1 * V= 150 * 12 = 1800 kg\n\nTearing the problem down further,\n\nNow, weight/area = mass/volume = \u03c1 * A, so 1800 = \u03c1 * 66, so \u03c1 = 1802/66 which is\na very small number, so let's simplify by approximating the area as 1 foot by 1\nfoot which gives A = 1.\n\nW/A = mass/volume = (1800)/1 =", "answer": " 15400"}

I see \"C: include examples\" and I think \"This is one of the things that a student might do to prepare dinner\".\n\nAnswer: You should never post log files, exceptions, or compiler errors in a StackOverflow question or answer.\n\nAlso, never paste a complete code run. Instead, paste your error and show us what you have tried and what went wrong. Remember that we can't tell everything from code snippets in the StackOverflow question body or editor.\n\nAs I read the question and other comments though, I still haven't figured out what the question is. It appears that you are testing and asking which example is the best one.\n\nIf you have this much code for a few examples, try to create a method instead of defining separate variables for each data block.\n\nAnswer: A more Pythonic way to structure this is to use a list comprehension to make the output of a list of strings for each choice. Then, in the end, you would use a single if block based on the length of the list to return the proper string. The following block shows an example:\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport re\n\nchoices = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"None\"]\n\ndef answer(input):\n\n    correct = False\n    output = \"\"\n    for i in choices:\n        if input ==", "answer": " 12"}

Let\u2019s examine why this is:  Raincoats are worn to protect a persons body from rain.  Raincoats can be worn while raining hard or lightly.  Umbrellas are worn by holding them up to shield someone from rain.  There are two types of umbrellas, automatic umbrellas and manual umbrellas. Manual umbrellas must be held up at all times;  automatic umbrellas open and close by the push of a button.  The reason that umbrellas are used to protect people from rain is that they shield people from the rain and protect them.  Even if it is raining hard, when the rain is coming down heavy (more than drops per second), people still do not like to get wet and so carry an umbrella or wear a raincoat to protect themselves.  Why would one wear a raincoat if they have an umbrella?

Choices:   Roundness: A sphere is round, so it makes contact with the surface in a continuous way, and will tend to spin.  Shape is an ellipse: When an object is rotated, it produces a rotation about the mid-point of the shape. The center of a sphere is the midpoint of the sphere, so if the rotation is started, it will tend to spin. Speed: Something spinning on a flat surface can only spin in the horizontal axis. That means it can only spin left or right. But a sphere can only spin 2 ways: front to back, and back to front. That means it can just spin clockwise, or counter clockwise. Rotation inertia: When a spinning object stops moving on a flat surface, it stops spinning. But a sphere keeps spinning because it has inertia.\nOutput: C: Shape is an elipse\n\nInput: What mathematical property describes the way the sun and the moon appear to move across the sky.

For the main room, they do not mind which is on the left or the right and which is on the bottom or the top.  They cannot afford 2 children sleeping on floors, which means they need at least 2 bedrooms.  Mike and Julie do not drink coffee, but they have figured out they can afford having one or two children drinking coffee every day.  They were not sure why it was important they could give their children different lunches, so they figured 2 children for each meal is fine.\n  When it came time to do the groceries, they realized they would need 1 carton of milk for each meal and 1 carton of juice for each meal, plus 1 chicken for each child for 24 children.  They decided to stop buying their groceries as they realized the children would need 1 cookie and 1 can of soda every day, plus they would need 20 different types of food for dinner.\nAfter the kids had finished eating, they realized they would have to get 4 tables and 4 chairs for each child.  They needed 2 tables for every meal and 1 chair per child.  Every day they would need 1 toothbrush and 1 toothpaste for each child.

In 2014 it was 76 years. What is the percent change in life expectancy between 1859 and 2014? You can assume that people's ages are roughly evenly distributed.\n\nSolution: \n\nWe have: 1859 -> 36 years and 2015->76 years\n\nWe can use this pattern to get all the numbers:\n\nLet X be the age of a person, and let Y be the average age.\nY=(X)/(1+Y)\n\nY=(1859)/(1/1+156)\n\nY=1859/156\n\nX=Y(156)\nX=55,4517\n\nTherefore, The percet change (P) in life expectancy between these two years is \n\nP=(X1-X2)/X1\nP=1,(4517-(55))/(55,450)\n\nP = (156-1)/156\nP = 0.999=0.9999\n\n### Problem set 2\n\nWhat is the average rate of change when f(x) = x^n + x^5?\n\nSolution:\n\nWe'll have to work through this step-by-step, otherwise we'll have trouble solving the problem.\n\nLet's start by writing out the rules: f(x) = ax^k + bx.\n\nHere we'll say it's f(x) = (x^n + x^m)^p for all nonnegative integers n,m (we'll also leave out the p because we'", "answer": " 6"}

For each word you want to remember, you are going to create an array of that spelling and then store it in a file.  Each word on the list is a different length (one word may be 5 letters long, like \u201ccat\u201d, while another word may have 12 letters, like \u201csyllabus\u201d).  If a word is 6 letters or more, it is considered a palindrome -- they are able to be read in either direction and still have the same spelling.  If the word is not a palindrome and if the word is between 1 and 5 letters (not included) you should be able to spell it forwards without any problems.  The only exception is if it is the word \u201cof\u201d, then you should be able to read it as \u201cOFF\u201d.  If the word is more than 6 letters, and is a palindrome, then you must be able to spell the word both forwards and backwards.\n  \n1.

{"text": "To determine this, we can use rounding rules and the rule of three. To do that, we'll need to find how many digits Sam memorized which allows us to find the ratio of digits memorized by the two. For example to find:\n\n6*2/4 = 1.5\n\nwhich rounds up to 2 and,\n\n2*3/4 = 1\n\nsince it's the same base. So:\n\n6*(2/3) = 4 since this is what the problem statement asked for.\n\nTo get the ratio of number of digits memorized we would need to round our numbers to the same base. That's why we're getting 3 instead of 2 because we rounded up. The value to memorize is 4 so\n\n4:1 is our ratio. So to get the number of digits, we would multiply by 4 since it's the ratio. So:\n\n4*Mina = 4*6 = 24 (what Sam memorized) (from the ratio and the rounding rules I know this is correct)\n\nNow that we understand the basis behind our answer, we'll check to see if it's reasonable by plugging in some numbers\n\n6*2 = 12,\n\nmeaning that sam, Carlos, and Mina each memorized 12 digits.\n\nSince Sam, Carlos, and Mni memorized the same number of digits, the answer is reasonable.", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "(You may not get this right.) *The solution uses the equation (10+5-8/10)* and is probably the hardest part of the challenge at this point. The solution needs the remainder of 1 (2). You can substitute this into the equation but the formula doesn't work without the remainder.  The solution was two pencils in each of the boxes.\n\n    Arnel had ten boxes of 100 pencils.  He kept 10 pencils and shared them equally with his five friends making boxes 200/5 = 40 pencils each, and if the boxes had only 200 pencils you would need three boxes of them to make all the boxes the same amount.  Therefore, Arnel took one box of 100 and gave 90 pencils of them away. His equation was 10+90-40=1 remaining.  The remainder is 1 and the equation is (10+54-10)/10 = 2/10.  Take the remainder of one and substitute in the second variable, 2. 2/1 = 2/1 =.5.  The boxes are 50 pencils each.  Arnel's solution was correct.\n\nThe solution is not as difficult as it seems because he has ten boxes and the same amount of pencils in all of them.  He takes 10 pencil and shares them equally with his 5 friends and the boxes had 200 pcs in each box so to take only 200/10 = 20 pcs, in each box makes all the boxes the same number of pcs.  He is now left with 200-20 = 180 pcs in all the boxes.  He now has 40 boxes the same number of PC's, with four boxes left over.  By the same amount he has left the same 240 box with the same number of PCs in all the boxes except four.\n\n### Challenge:\n  (This section has three different prompts.

{"text": "Let t = fill up and r = remain to be filled, this gives the flow equation: rdr = 12 where r is measured from when t = 0, the first time the water supply is open. Taking the derivative of this: dr/r = 12/t r is now measured from 0 but this time this time the water supply is closed when t = 0 and thus dr = 0 and this shows that t r dr = t1 dr +...+ t0 dr = 12, therefore, we can conclude that 2(t1) = 12 which simplifies to 2(t1/2) = 12 and as t1/2 can equal only one value we can conclude that t = 2 minutes to fill the tub\n\n### Inputs:Ask Mr. Ney why he is not using the normal arithmetic series formula to solve for the number of repetitions of opening and closing the tap, which in the question is the same as the number of steps.\n\n### Response : When an equation or formula is a solution of other, it is commonly stated that it can be derived from or reduced to the other. In the case of Mr. Ney, it is known that the water supply is closed for 1 minute but the flow rate is 12 litres/minute, as well as the flow rate of the tap being 12 litres. Therefore, the question is finding the flow rate of the water tap, using the question statement as well as our given formula, we can state the problem as finding t, and we know if we put 2 t = 12 then we know we can also state that 12/2 = 1, from which we can then state that by definition that the flow rate of the washing machine is 7500 litres/hour\n\n### Input : Is there a more elegant solution than the arithmetic difference and derivative?\n\n### Answer: Yes:\nThere is in fact a more elegant solution to the problem, it is simply to use the fact that the flow rate after 1 or 2 steps is a number of litres which can then be used to find the time it takes to fill the tub up in seconds. This solution is more elegant because it uses less notation.\n\n### Input\nIn the math problem I am given 12 litres a minute as a known", "answer": " 24"}

First the number of people eating. 4, but we've excluded that now.  We will use only the child eating and grandparents eating.  Now let us see the amount of plates we will need.  The number on the top is the number of plates each person uses.  For the left side of the equation we will need 1, which is the number of planks used by the child.  To get to the number needed for the grandparents on the 3rd set of columns, you will need to double the planks used by the first, or get the number of planks of the grandparents by adding the number of the child and subtracting a 1.  For the right side of the equation we need to know the number of planks for the child and the grandparents.  We subtract the number we need of each, which is the grandparent's plates.  The number for the second and fourth columns will be multiplied by 2.  That is a total of 8 planks.  Now we subtract that from 8, which is 6 and the answer is 6.  We will want to use 6 planks for the kid and the grandparents, for a total of 7.  Let the number of left to right planks we need be NLPR.  Let the number ontop be NO.  You have NO - (NLPR*2), and NO - (NLPR)  You should get the NO - (NLPR - (NLPR* 2)) which is now equivalent to 11 - (NLPR - 6).

Then it can be simplified. The only numbers that are left are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,and 15. If k is divisible by 13 then the number that would be reached is 0. Since you do addition and then you reach the number k. Since the number k is 15 then 15+0=15 or 15+15=30. 13 can't divide by 15. You then subtract 0 from 30. Then 30-15=15. Since 15 is divisible by 3 then the 15+0 number is divisible by three. The 15+0 = 30. Then you just repeat the process like you did for 15. Since the 15+30 = 45. Then you subtract until you get the number to 5 that's divisible by 11 then you just get 5 and 12+2 = 14. Then you subtract 14-15 = -1.

The pizza slices are each cut into 4 pieces for a total of 288 pieces.\n* If we suppose all of the slices of each type of pizza were uneaten then the uneaten pieces would be 288 - 271 = 17.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nYou first calculate how many personal pan pizza slices are left uneaten.\nSince you start with 288 slices and assume that each pizza is shared evenly between each person, each person should take 73 slices.\nThe question then states that Bill and Dale each eat 50% leaving them with 36 slices each, so 40% or 36 out of 73 should still be uneaten.\nThe next person Ann, each gets 73-36 = 37 slices leaving her with 79 slices eaten and 79-71 = 8 slices uneaten (rounding to 0).\nThe last person to eat is Cate, so she will get 21 slices, therefore leaving her with 42 slices eaten and that leaves us with 17 uneaten pieces.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "11\n\n### Demostration:\n[Instruction:Answer the following math grade question.][Input] What did we say? That there should be 11 seats. Why? When 2/5 are not occupied, there is one seat left per row that is at least not occupied and one chair per row can be occupied because every row contains exactly 2 chairs. Thus, there are 5 x 2 = 10 available chairs. And how many chairs are available if every seat from every row is occupied? 5 x 12 = 60. 60 / 50 = 100% for the 12 available chairs in every row and 50 out of the 50% of all chairs left unoccupied would be unoccupied, so that there would be no empty seats.

{"text": "The answer is 50%\n\n\n### Feedback:\n* This question asks for a value that is expressed as a percent of a whole.\n* There is more than one way to solve this, but you can use the formula: (b - a) / (b - c) where b is AVERAGE,a is THE HIGH, c is THE LOW. In this case, I got 100%. The key is if you get that answer, you've done it correctly, since you have to add up 228+120+147 to get 695, and then that's divided by its final height of 540 for the fraction. \n* That's why the only wrong choices would be B and C. \n\n### Comments:\n* This question took three tries before I got it right. \n* I tried guessing the percentages by taking the difference between the numbers and dividing that by the height and it didn't work. \n* The reason it didn't work was because I was taking the difference of the heights and dividing that instead of taking the difference between the final heights and dividing. \n* This is a good problem to use to get more familiar with percentages. \n* I got 80% on this.

{"text": "284 parking spot\n\n### Instruct\n**What are you instructing them to?**\n\n- This is why it is useful to know how to write instructional text, but it is not the whole story. When we write about the world, there are still many forms that we use every day to communicate with one another.\n- People have been giving and receiving instructions on everything from building a campfire to tying their bowels for thousands of years. There are dozens of types of instructions available, some of which require special knowledge, tools, or training to understand, follow, or properly write down.\n- Writers who hope to master the art of telling others how to do something. They use their ability to learn from their experience and to communicate it to others to guide them through difficult tasks. When you use instructions, you often find that they are much more than a description of what needs to be done.\n- This is just one of the types of texts you will write as a writer. The purpose of instructions is to guide people through a series of steps. Instructions come in a variety of forms and have a range of styles.\n- What are the benefits of writing instructions? In this way, you show them how to do something, you take the sting out of doing the task.\n\n- Why are people interested in learning how to write instructions?\n- How might people use instructions in their own lives?\n- What kinds of things would they like to know how to do?\n\nInstructions are a type of text which are used for teaching people how to do things. They follow a specific format and are often organized in a step-by-step fashion, making it easier for the reader to understand what needs to be done before they begin. When writing instructions, it is important to identify the audience and then tailor the language so they\u2019re able to understand it.\n\n### Definition\n**What is your definition?**\n\n- Instructions come in all kinds, whether written or spoken. Instructions may give a set of steps to follow in carrying out some action(s). A recipe is an instruction for cooking something, as is an oral instruction for a friend. Usually, to communicate effectively instructions need to be clear, logical, and precise. Sometimes they will be given orally, and other times they may be written.\n\n- The instructions can be either clear or unclear, and", "answer": " 186"}

The time throwing tantrums would be 11 because 13+4 would be 17 and 1+1=2.

So B+M = 1 mile.  Since we're running 6+7 mph we can calculate the time by adding 6 + 7 and then half the sum to get 10.5.  The same goes for the second half 7+7 = 14.5.  So B+E + M(half) = 1 mile, B+M+M = 2 miles\nThe same goes for M+B + E.  So the first half of mile = 10.5 mph, the second half = 14.6 mph, and the total half mile = 25.2 mph.\n\n### Response\nt1 = time at 6 mph.  t2 = time at 7 mph.   T = total time.

To demonstrate that it is not just because they think they are smart the student should explain in words and with a picture how to come to that conclusion.\n\n### Explanation: The graph shows that Betty is 60 years of age and her daughter is one year younger than her so Betty is 61 and her daughter is 59. Betty's granddaughter is 25 percent younger so her daughter is 58 years old. The granddaughter must therefore be 25 years of age.\n\nInput: A 12-ft long, 6-in wide, and 0.5-in thick metal bar is being pulled horizontally at a constant speed.

They should also demonstrate the process of determining the force.\n\n### Response from an exemplary student:\n\n**Response: ** The formula is F = mg, and I got 7.2 lb\n\n### Examplary student response:\n\n**Above student response:** \n\nFirst I looked at the mass and the length. To do this I used 7 ft because 7 + 3 = 10 but 10 is not evenly divisible by 5 so I subtracted the 2 from each end leaving me with 7 ft. Then I multiplied the 3 ft / second (which represents the speed or the rate at which the bar is being pulled) with the length to get 21 in which I squared, getting 441 in which I finally divided by 2 to get 220.5, which was my mass. This is a lot of equations but the teacher will only see the final number and understand that the student understands how to solve this problem.\n\nThe mass of the bar is 5 pounds and the speed of the bar is 3 ft/sec., so to find my force I multiplied the 220.3 with that 3 to get 660.9", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "The snowdrift was \n34 inches at the end of the forth day. On the first day the drift was 6 inches deep. On the third day the drift was about 18 inches. On the end of the fourth the drift was at34 inches. \n\n\n### InputA big snowstorm dropped a large amount of snow into an empty field.  The ground was completely covered by an 18-inch-deep snowdrift.  Once the snowstorm stopped, a few more inches of snow fell on top of the drift because the weather got unusually cold.  Then the temperature warmed up, and the sun came out.  This caused most of the snow to melt. The ground that was originally covered by an 19-inch-deep drift was now only 4 inches deep.  The mushrooms were growing on this patch of ground in the same field.  Each mushroom was 4 inches tall and spanned 2 inches across.  If you had picked up one of the mushrooms, you would have found that it weighed 15.6 ounces.  If you did some research, you would realize that there are 35.274 ounces in a pound. \nSo, to find out how many pounds of soil each mushroom took up, you would need to divide 35.2 by 15.6.\nBut you forgot that 1 inch = 12 inches in a foot. So you would first multiply the inches in your mushroom by 12.  \n  \n(That is basically the same as saying that if you doubled the mushroom's height, you would get something more like a pound.)\n  \nThis equals 24 pounds of soil per mushroom.\n  \n\n### InputHow deep are the holes in the field dug out by the pumpkins that grow in the field?

{"text": "When I first read this question my initial response was that I did not understand what it was asking and what exactly I was expected to arrive at. I realized that I have to have patience with myself and the people who created this task in order to understand the problem and make a response. I have done just that and arrived with the answer (110 balloons).\nThe above question requires you to understand how many balloons are intact, where the number of balloon that blown up is equal to `1 / 5th of the total number of 1000 balloons that is in the hot air baloon`. This represents the fact that 200 baloons already blown up and double the number of balloonn that already blown up also doubled.  \n\nThe above represents the fact that after 2 hours, only 100 balloons are balloons remaining. This means that the hot air balloons is blown up with 1000 in it and 1000-100=900 are no longer in the hot air baloons. Now divide the 500 balloons, meaning that you have to divide 200 baloon and 300 balloons and that is why for part `A` of the question, the `correct` answer is `110` because we have divided the 200 balance by 5, there by leaving the remainder as `20` remaining. Now for part `B` of the question, 20 balloons is the new total, leaving only 110 balloon left and for `part C` with double the number of baloon that already blown (500 vs 1000), which is 1000 the total is 110 left. So the `correct` answer will simply be `110`.", "answer": " 80"}

Thus, there is no answer, so the student does not need to solve this question.\n\n## Task:The following task requires the student to write out a series of steps the student could use to complete this task.\n\n### Task:Solve 13^15\n\n### Tactical:To solve a power of a natural number by the prime factorization method we can start by listing out all the prime divisors. Since we are beginning with a power we know that in order to solve this we must divide by every prime factor. Here we have a power of 13 so this means that we must begin by listing out prime numbers.\n\n* 2\n* 3\n* 5\n* 7\n* 11\n* 13\n\nWith those 13 as our smallest prime factors we can look at the value of those prime factors. Since we will need to divide by them to get to the final answer, we will have to find 15/prime factors. If we multiply 13 times the prime factor we see that any of the divisors 2,3,5,7,11, or 13 will work.\n\nSo, to begin let's calculate 15 by dividing by our prime factors.\n\n* 15/2 = 7.5\n* 15 /3 = 5\n* 13 / 5 = 2.6\n* 15/(5 * 3) =7.5\n*  15/(13 * 2) = 6.9\n* 15/-13 = 1.16\n\nNext we will add together everything that we have calculated and our total will get to 23.4, which we will round to 23.\n\nAs a second example, the value of 13^2 will have a prime factor of 2. We can write this as 13^2=2^3*11^1\n\n### Explanation: This is the explanation that the student must write out.\n\n### Exploration: This is the exploration that the student must write.\n\n# Task:Write the number that is not a prime number.\n\n## Tasks\n\n##", "answer": " 97"}

Note that an answer should be correct regardless of how the question is written. For example, the response to the above question could also be \"1.5 gallons\" or \"1.5 GL\", etc.\n\nThe only time the response \"1 1/2 GAL\" would be incorrect is if the word \"bottle\" was not used. If there was no bottle in the equation than the total liter of liquid is a 1 1\u20442 gal, which would be written \"1.5 GL\" in this case.\n\n### Why\nThis solution is useful for questions that ask for an answer that cannot be completed. This solution works because there is no specific answer length.\n\n### Usage\nUse this solution when there is ambiguity in the wording. This is a common situation in many questions because multiple quantities with different units will come up in real life.\n\nHere is an article:  [https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/real-numbers-solution.html](https://www.mathisfun.com/algebra/reals).\n\n### Answer\n1 1/2 Gallon\n\n### Uses\n\n### Example Solutions\nThere are multiple ways to solve this task, and this solution is one of those ways.\n\n### Example of the task in a real scenario\n\nHere is a real scenario where I would use the solution\n\n### Sample answer\nOne liter is equal to approximately 0.26 gallons, so a", "answer": " 37"}

Jack's contribution is 2/3rds of what his original assembly speed was which is 4 widgets/8 hours- the assembly time is 2\nFor Sam it is 1 widget/8 hours and for Tony it is 8/8 hours because he worked from 12:00 AM to 8:00pm. So the assembly time for the 3 workers is 1,2,8. After getting those assembly times we need to find the average of them which is 4 and the question asks for the assembly time of Tony. You can do it by using an average or by finding out the total assembly time divided by 3 to get the assembly time of Tony who worked for 8 hours.\n\n### Answer\n\nTony worked for 8 hours, there were 68 widgets completed, so Tony, on average, put together 8 widgets.\n\n### Input : 10^4 - 5*10^3 + 3 - 6 / 2 + 25 - 4 = 1^4 / 2^5\n\n### Response : 4!/(25! 10^4) = 4!/10^5 = 204!/10^4\n\n### Answer : 204!/5^4", "answer": " 30"}

I am sure the instructor had no idea that a student would actually use the quiz object for the questions. It was also a program where we did not create an object for the test questions but instead just wrote it as a string (all of the instructions, questions, and possible answers as a string).\n\n### Output Description\n\nWhen the quiz object is created, the questions are added to it and saved to the object for further reference. The questions are then added to the quiz object using createQuizQuestion and saved to the object. All questions are then given a number from 1 to the number in the questionArray (the number of questions in the object). The quiz object is then referenced in main.js in order to take the questions using quiz.main().\n\n### Lesson learned\n\nIf we are using objects, there really isn't a reason to use strings and only include them if you have to. We could have simply created a questionArray object that contained each possible set of a question and answers in order to test and mark the user's answer for each question using questionArray.answer[x];. The object would have been better for this because it would store each question with no need for referencing the string object.", "answer": " 10"}

In this task, students should demonstrate the following:\n\n- They are able to interpret the problem and represent the information.\n- They use addition to demonstrate how to add quantities, using words and symbols appropriately.\n- They use subtraction to demonstrate how to subtract quantities, using words and/or symbols to represent the operation appropriately.\n\nIn this task, students could demonstrate their understanding of math by using their vocabulary correctly and efficiently when working through these problems. For example, in the first problem, when working out how many days it would take for Johnny to have three times as much practice compared to the quantity he had when he began, students should not simply guess or apply formulas such as multiplying by three.\nStudents should use their math vocabulary and thinking skills to apply the following logic. We can see that the answer is \"Thirtyfive days from now Johnny will have three times the number of practice days as he did two weeks ago.\", but if we ask ourselves, \"How many days ago was that?\" we can also see that if Johnny's number of practice days was half of the quantity he currently had, then we can apply the rule of \"double the answer.\" In other words, since Johnny had 20 days of practice before having half as many practice days, we can apply \"double\" to thirty-five, which equals 70. Therefore, we can see that thirty-five days prior to Johnny practicing three times as much as he does now, his practice days will be 70.\n\nThere is also a second logical conclusion that", "answer": " 80"}

We know that 10 gallons equals 10 * 100 cuis, giving us that if we have 10 gallons we will have 10 * 9 gallons = 90 cuis.

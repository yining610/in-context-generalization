This is because they share the profit in the ratio 2 : 5. Accordingly, Mike's share is 2 times Johnson's share, so the ratio is 2 : 5 = 2 : 5\n4)To find Mike's share, we must subtract what Johnson got from what Mike got. The answer is Mike's share is $2000.\n5)To solve for Mike's share after spending some money on a shirt that cost $200, we must first subtract the cost of shirt - $200 = $1800 from Mike's share.

We need calculate the amount of credit she will need for her next shopping trip, given the information provided in the question.\n3. First, we need to determine how much money Mary used during each shopping trip.\n4. Mary spent $100 during the first shopping trip, of which $15 and $23 respectively were paid on Tuesday and Thursday.\n5. This means that she spent $82 on both Tuesday and Thurday.\n6. Therefore the amount that Mary spends on shopping during each trip is $100 - $82 = 18, implying that she spent $18 at each trip.\n7. Next, we need to calculate how much credit she needs to pay.\n8. The amount that Mary spends during each trip is $82, so if she needs to pay that amount in total, then she would need a credit of 100 - $18 = 82.\n9.

The first ball is a half of the second ball in diameter, which can be represented as 22 and 44, respectively. The third ball is 3 times as large as the second, which suggests that it is about 120 in diameter. We can find the radius of the third ball, and the diameter of the second ball using these numbers as follows: d = (22^1/2) * 2 = 3.3 feet  \nr = d/2 = 1.65 feet\nShe used 27 feet for the third ball. To determine the amount of yarn used for the second ball, we subtract the amount of yarn for the first and third balls from the total 27 feet.  d = 1.667 ft\nThe total amount of yarn for balls 1, 2 and 3 is : d = 22 + 44 + (27 - 22 - 44) = 31.07 ft\n\n\nNow, we have to find what % of the total yarn of yarn is used for the second ball.\n\nUsing formula to calculate %: Percentages can be calculated as follows:\n\nfraction \\% = % fraction  \n100 \\% = whole number  \n\\\nWhich suggests that Joy used 46.8% of the yarn she had left for the second ball.  \nSo, in conclusion, Joy used 14.27 feet for the second ball.", "answer": " 18"}

Choices: 1 y = x^2 + x 2 y = x^2 - x 2 3 y = 2x - x^2 4\nOutput:1. First, we need to identify the correct symbol for the curve in the given problem:\n2. The key to identifying this symbol is examining the context in which it is used. In this case, it is present in the context of the equation for the area of this curve, which is defined as the integral of y over the area.\n3. The integral of y is defined as indefinite, meaning that it includes all values between any two numbers. Therefore, to calculate the area of this curve properly, we need to find the integral of x^2 over the area, which can be done by finding the area under the curve and adding it for each value from x = 0 to x = 1.\n4. We can also note that the symbol is written as \" \", which is a standard way to write the area of a function for a particular area.\n5. Consequently, the correct expression for calculating the area of the curve is:\n6.

To solve this problem, let the number of required hours per day = R and the number of days in a year = y.\n2. In order to reach the goal, Randy would need to practice for a total of 10,025 days.\n3. If Randy wants a minimum number of required hours to be 400, the number of hours required per day is (10025 \u00f7 400) = 25\n4. Assuming that each day is an hour off, this means that Randy will need to work for 8 hours each day, with the total number of days per year being 366 (leap year). \n5. Adding an extra week for vacation and not accounting for weekends, Randy would need 519 hours per year on average. \n6. To meet the requirement of 400 hours per year with vacation, he needs to have 800 hours to be on the safe side (leave 7 hours per day for breaks, miscellaneous, etc.).

{"text": "The key to solving this question is to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces.  By doing so, we can see that we need to think about a number in the following ways:\n1. First Year:  $0\n2. Second Year: $?\n3. Third Year: $2?\n4. Fourth Year: $4?\n5. Total: $3?\n6. The question provides us with three pieces of information: \n\n1. Missy put $450 in her bank after four years.\n2. Missy doubled the amount she put in the bank every year.\n3. Missy put money in the bank for four years.\n\n7. We need to solve for an initial amount x then use that amount to double for each year. One way to do this is to plug in the number 0 in for x and solve to get $0. This means that Missy put $0 in her bank for her first year.\n8. Then multiply $0 by two to get $0. She doubled her money so the amount she put in her bank should be $0. This, of course, makes no sense, so we need to solve again to find the second year.\n9. $0 x 2 = $0\n10. This seems similar to the answer we found for the first year, but the second year is $0 multiplied by two, not $0 plus two.\n11. So, we can plug in $0 for x, solve and get $0, then multiply by two to get the second year, which is a total of $0.\n12. Keeping this pattern, we can solve for the third year and then multiply by two to see the fourth year.\n13. So to solve for the third year, we plug in 0 (zero) for x and get $0. Then multiply by two and get $0.\n14. So the third year is $0.\n15. Next, we multiply 0 by two to get the fourth year which is $0.\n\n16. Therefore, we can solve for all four years as follows:\n\n7th year: $0\n\n8th year: $0 \n\n9th year: $0  \n\n10th year: $0   \n\nTherefore, the final answer is a total of $3", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "10 gallons\n2. Start by understanding the problem.\n3. The question states that a car's fuel consumption is 20 gallons per 400 miles, and Mr. Montero' math teacher provides 8 gallons of fuel.\n4. Given this information, we need to calculate the number of gallons of fuel needed to complete a trip of 600 miles.\n5. From the relationship between fuel consumption and distance traveled provided in the original question.\n6. We can calculate the distance the car can travel on the 8 gallons of gas provided by the math teacher by dividing the distance traveled (400 miles) by the fuel consumption (20).\n7. We can then subtract the distance previously calculated (160 miles) from the total distance needed to travel in order to complete the trip (600 miles).\n8. This gives us the number of gallons needed to travel the remaining distance, which is 440 miles.\n9. This means that the car will need an additional 10 gallons of gas in order to travel the extra 100 miles.\n10. This means that if Mr. Montero were to travel to and back from the new location 2 more times to reach a total of 600 traveling miles, he would need another 10 gallons.\n11. So, the final answer is 10 gallons to travel 60 gallons back and forth.\nSo the final step is:\n10 gallons to 60 gallons\n60 divided by 10\n6.67 times per tank.\nSo the final roundtrip calculation is:\n600 / 6.67 = 90.99\nRound-trip: 3 x 90.9 = 272.7 or\nTotal miles traveled: 3 x 181.8 or 545.6\nSo the final answer to the question is 10 gallon of gas", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": "1.

The 4008 scrolls and the 4080 scrolls can relate in the following way: 4008 + 4080 = 8098 -> 8098 is an even number -> it cannot be odd.\n3. If 8098 = (odd number of scrolls) +(even number of scrolls), then even number of scrolls can also be positive odd.\n4. By extension, all odd combinations of scrolls sum to an even number, so 2, 3, 4, 5 can be 4008, 4080, 4144, 4200 and etc.\n5. Since 50000 = 2(25000) + (25000), for the 408 scrolls sum to 204000(which is another even number) and it should not be odd.

We need to understand how age contributes to weight and we can do that by studying a chart of the body mass index (BMI). A BMI chart contains two variables: 1) height, and 2) weight. The BMI provides a rough estimation for the best weight for each height. The chart also shows that body weight fluctuates from age 20 to age 60. \nBased on this information, the answer must be a B.", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "1. The question states that Angie bought 3 lb of coffee, each lb of coffee will brew 40 cpoes of coffee.\n2. According to the question, 3 cups of coffe in 1 day Angie drinks 5 cups of coffee every week.\n3. Calculate the number of days that Angie's coffee will last her.\n4. First we need to calculate how many days one lb last, 40/(3/7.89) = 13.67 days = 13 days\n5. Then we multiply 13 with 3 to find out how many cups of coffee a one lb will last, and then we find that the number of days will be 40 * 13 = 520 days of coffee in one year.\n6. Find out the number of daya a month has then find out the number of day after 520 days by using the equation 520/365 = 1.4 days\n7. So this coffee will last for 2 days more than she will normally drink (3/7.87 cups for one lb). \n8. The answer is: B) 520 days\nSo the final answer  is B:520 days\n\nInput:What was the outcome in the battle between a dragon and two knights?

{"text": "1) First, find the length of shadow of the building for the first hour after noon, denoted by $n$. 2) Since the length of shadow gets bigger by 5feet every hour, you can then substitute $n$ into the equation to find the length of shadow for any given hour, such as ($n + 4$) which represents 6 hours past noontime. 3) From there, once you have your two values for $n$ it's just a matter of solving the equation for $n$. For example, you can say that: $n^2 - 49n - 290 = 0$. Once that equation is simplified you get: $\\sqrt {n^2-49n} = 290$, and since $n > 4$ you can just take $n^2-189n=290$. Which reduces to: $n-49 = 290$. $n = 339$. 4) Finally, to find how long the shadow is, $5feet \\times 339 \\pm 29$, because you can only ever subtract $29$ since the shadow has to start back at $0$ after every hour. So the answer is around $42,420$ inches.\nSo the final answers are $n=339$ and $42420\u00b129$.\n\nInput: We had so much bread the last time we asked for a loaf that we ended up with too much.

{"text": "1: We can see from the question that we are looking to calculate the amount of money the restaurant earns by the end of the week.\n2. We will use the following formula to calculate the amount that will be in the account at the end of the month.\n3. $$amount_in_bank = weekday_earnings + 2\u2217weekend_earnings$$\n4. Substituting our given information, $$amount_in_the_bank = $600 + 2\u2217$600 + \u20b91200 = $2400 \n5. Which means that the restaurant will have a total of \u20b92400 in its account at the end of every weekend and \u20b92402 in its account at the beginning of every week.\n6. So, the total amount of money in the account after a month is: $$amount_in_account = \\frac{number_of_weeks}{3}\\times2402 + 2400$$ \n7. Where $number_of_wekss$ here represents the number of weeks in an Indian month, which is roughly 26-28. We will use the 27 as a medium value.\n8.

{"text": "11. Here are 11 steps for analyzing and answering this question.\n2. 1. The question states that Matt buys a massager and it vibrates at speeds of 1600VP/S at its lowest setting and 60% faster at its highest setting.\n3. 2. At the lowest setting, the massager generates 1600 VP/S, indicating a frequency of 160 Hz.\n4. 3. At the highest setting, the massager's frequency is 300 Hz, implying that it generates 300 vibrations each second at this setting.\n5. 4. If Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes, he experiences a total of 5 x 300 = 1,500 vibrations.\n6. 5. As per the question, the massager vibrates at a rate 60% faster than its lowest setting.\n7. 6. Therefore, when set to the highest of 3 different speeds, the massager vibrat es at 60% of the lowest speed, which is a rate of 960 Hz. \n8. 7. If we subtract the original 160 HZ from the massager's highest setting, we get 1,508 Hz at which the massager operates.  \n9. 8. At this higher setting, Matt experiences 5 x 1,50 8 = 7,540 vibrations in 5 minutes, which is 1,507 vibrations per second of operation at this setting.\n10. 9. Multiplying this rate of 1,509 VP/S by the minutes of use of 5 gives Matt 7,545 vibrations experienced in 5 minutes as the cumulative output.\n11. 10. We can arrive at this figure by using these two steps: (1) Total # of minutes = 5 (2) Total # of vibrations experienced = 7545, which answers the question.\nSo the final step is the answer:  1600 x 5 = 8000\n\nInput: A man has a headache, so he takes an aspir", "answer": " 768000"}

May can knit 3 scraves using one yarn so it can be deducted that she can knit 1 scarf using one blue yarn because 1: 3 / 6 = 1/3 or one third of one blue yarn can be used to knit one scarf.\n3. Similarly using 1:3 = 1 scarf / 3 yarns she can knit 3 scars.\n4. Knitting one scarf using one blue, 2 red and 3 yellow takes 4 blue yarns, 2 red yarms and 6 yellow yarns so total 4 blue yarms + 2 red yarngs + 6 yellow yarngs gives rise to 6 yellow yarms. So total number of yellow yarns = 4 + 2 + 6 =12 yarns.\n5. 4 * 6 yellow plus 12 yellow = 24 yellow.\n6. 4 * 3 blue plus 2 red plus 3 yellow = 11 blue yarns,1 red yarn and 3 yellow yarns.\n7. 11 blue yarn plus 3 red yarns plus 3 yellow yarngs plus 25 blue plus 25 yarns = 50 yarn.\n8.12 yellow yarns + 3 yellow yarhns + 12 red yarns = 27 yellow yarns and 12 red yars.\n9. 24 yellow yarns plus 6 yellow yarhns plus 16 red yarns plus total yarn equals 46 yellow yarns and total plus 16 reds = 62 yarns. \n10.

{"text": "1. The question: How much money did Austin start with? \n2. We are given: that Austin bought his seven friends each an identical robot and that each robot costs $8.35\n3. First, we find the total cost of the robots: \n7 robots = $7*10.53, or $78.90, and we substract 10.50 to get 6.40\nAnd we know, as it came up in the question that the $7.22 is the total tax amount.\n4. To help us to figure out how much Austin started with, we can do the calculation:\ntotal cost of 7 robots - $7.22 in tax = $50.68\nIn the total amount of $11.52 in change after selling it - we can subtract the $7.20\nand get $4.32 \n5. If we now subtract $50.69 from $4.32 we get back to start with \n11.52 - 50.69 = 0\n6. Which means that Austin started with 11.52 dollars \nSo in a nutshell, you'll need: \n10.50 robots \n4.32 change \nTo end up with $0\nSo the final answer to the question is: 11.53 dollars", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "1)Alex has two cakes that are each have 8 slices. 2)He gives away a fourth of the total slices to his friends, and a third of the remaining sliced to his family. 3)He eats three slices of cake. 4)Now we need to find how many slices are left. We can use the formula: P - Q = R, where P = Pieces Alex has, Q= Pieces he\u2019s given away, and R= Pieces he\u2019ll eat. We substitute the values we know: P = 2(8), Q = 2(3), and R = 2(3) - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4 \n5)Since he gives away more to his family than his friends, each slice he has left will go to his family, so we divide by two for each piece. Thus: R/2 = -4/2. But R/2 = -1/2. R = -1 cake, or Alex is left with one piece of cake.\nSo the final equation is: P = 2X8, Q = 2X3, R = X - 6 and X = 2-6 = -4\nSo the equation is: 2X = 2X8 + 2X3 - 2X (X = 2-6, X=2-6 = -6) 2(2*8+2*3-2*(-6))/2 = 20 = -1 Solving for X, we can find that the answer is X = -1.\nTherefore, the remaining equation is: P/2 = 2*8/2 + 2*3/2 = 8 + 6/2 = 9.\nSo in the end the correct answer is B: 9/2 = 4 1/2.\nThis is the first question in the section with the topic \"Counting to 10\"\n\nInput: How many chairs can be made from 2 pine boards and 2 oak boards per the instructions?Choices:  A: 3 B: 4 C: 6 D: 2 E: 5 F: 6\nOutput: 1.)The question is asking about making chairs from pine and oak bo", "answer": " 5"}

Based on the information given, Miriam spent 30 min doing laundry, a certain amount of minutes cleaning the bathrm, 40 min doing homework, and 15 min cleaning her room. \n4. To figure out how long she spent cleaning her room, we know that she spent 0.5x as much time cleaning her room as she did doing laundry, and a certain amount of time as well. So, we can say that she spent 0, 30, 15, x minutes cleaning her room.\n5. Next, we need to plug these values into the equation (0.5*x) = n, which n= 40 or 40/0 = 40. \n6.

This indicates that Michael had originally 3 matchsticks per house he made, so if there are 3 houses, the number of matchstkicks he originally had to make each house is 3.\n2: Given that there are 30 matchstick houses and that each houses uses 10 match sticks, it can be understood that Michael made a total of 300 matchstick houses with a total of 3,000 match sticks. \n3: The second step is to determine the amount of matchsticks Michael currently has by subtracting the number of matchstixk houses he made from the number of matchstxicks he originally had, or 3000 \u2212 30, which results to 2,997, giving Michael 2,996 matchsticks remaining.\n4: Finally, the answer to the question asks the amount of matchstick left over after Michael made 30 miniature matchstick homes, or the quantity of matchstick that he still has remaining. When he makes 30 miniature houses is he starts out with 3,00 matchsticks, in this case Michael still has over one matchstick remaining, as 3000-30=2997, since he doesn't throw away any matchsticks he will still have one remaining.\n5: Hence, the total amount of available matchsticks after Michael was done crafting his model is 2,999.\nSo the final ans is 2999\n\nInput: He's still on the fence about which college to pick in his senior year of high school!

{"text": "1-2. We are asked how many times Tammy caught the ball out of a total of 23 catches made by Joe and Derek.\n3. First, let's start by determining each player's catches. \n4. 23 is the total number of catches so Derek and Tammy catch the ball a total of 22 times respectively. \n5. The first part of the question is about finding the number of catches Derek made - option A: the number of times he made nine catches, i.e. the number of catches he made minus two. \n6. The second part of the question is where Derek (22 catches) makes four less than twice as many catches as Joe (23 catches). The answer, therefore, is B: fourteen. \n7. Tammy, on the other hand, caught the ball a total of sixteen more times than a third of the total number of catchers by all three players combined. \n8. We can substitute the total number of catcher (23) with the total number of catch-ups (23/3)(6). This gives us an answer of 18. \n9.

Determine what information is given in the problem and use conditional statements to determine the correct answer.\nStep 3. Review solution options to find the one that fits the problem.\n\nStep 1. We have to evaluate the answer possibilities and the statement presented to get a clearer view on the problem.\n\n\"Max was doing homework from three different subjects in one night, and each subject took him differing amount of time, but geography took him the most time\"\n\"Max\u2019s homework took 20 minutes from biology\"\n\nWhat we know is:\n - Max was doing his homework from biology\n - The time taken to finish tasks from biomedicine was the minimum time\n - Max's homework took 60 minutes from history\n - The time taken for a Max homework from history was greater than any other subject\n - Max\u2019s homework took the most time for geography, but we don't know how long it was\n\nThe total time taken to complete Max's homework from all three subjects is 80 minutes.\n\nStep 2. For this question the given information is used in a conditional statement so we need to determine the conditions for which the answer will be maximum 60.\nIn this case, if Geometry took 2 times more time then history, then (480)/80 = 5 with \u22456.25 so the total time would be 80+6.25 = 86.25(480+6.5)/80=19. So we need to use 19 as our answer.\n\nStep 3. This problem has many choices but we can eliminate some because they don't fit the problem.\nThe given question doesn't state what time did he take to do the Geography task so the total time may have been greater. So that could not have been the answer.\nMax's homework from Geometry took 480 minutes and as we previously determined, history took 60 minutes so it had to be 4+480, which in that case should have been the answer. Instead, the answer was 19 which is the total from history plus the rest from geometry.\n\nSo the", "answer": " 180"}

Given that Steve picked 8 pounds on Monday, Tuesday's harvest was 3 times what he'd picked previously (= 3*8), so Tuesday's pickings were 24 pounds.\n2. But we also know that Steve felt very tired on Wednesday, so on Thursday, he was not going to pick as many berries.\n3. There are two possible interpretations.\n4. Option A: Steve's pickings were only 9 pounds on Thursday. This is likely correct.  This reasoning can be seen in the diagram below. We also know that Steve had to pick a total number of 100 pounds (the $100 target), but he could not pick 33 pounds on Thursday (the amount he had left with him, given he picked 9). So, Steve needed to pick 67 pounds on Thursday and this option seems to support that.\n5. Option B: Steve picked 12 pounds on Thursday by working for 2 hours. This option is problematic, because we don't know much about the time spent picking.  Additionally, according to the diagram, Steve should have picked 54 pounds on Thursday if he'd worked for 2 hours. \n6. Both of these options provide logical reasoning based on the information given.\n7.

Because she was not allowed to dress the wound, Mia notified the patient's doctor. The patient's chart was updated with the relevant information, and the doctor was informed to come back and assess the wound himself. If a doctor's visit could be unnecessary, the nurse does what? Choices: A: refer the patient to another hospital for a second opinion B: notify the patient's pharmacist C: call the patient's home\nOutput: 1-2. Considering Mia is a nurse, it is her job to follow the first aid procedures when treating a patient's injury or illness, and she is expected to notify a doctor if the patient has received a wrong medication. However, her duty does not extend to calling a patient's home to check on his/her condition, which is why option C is incorrect.\n3. There does not seem to be anything in the text that suggests the nurse is trying to diagnose the nasty wound or make a guess as to how serious/critical it is, so option A is also incorrect.\n4. As the patient is already receiving medication, option B is a possible choice, as pharmacists might advise the doctor if they notice any adverse side effects, but it's also worth considering that pharmacists do not have enough medical knowledge/experience to assess the patient's condition and diagnose the injury caused by the wrong medicine.\n5. When a patient receives a wrong medication, he/she can develop a nasty wound due to the drug's adverse side effects, which does not seem to be the case here because Mia noticed the patient already had a nasty wound caused by the wrong medication. We cannot conclude this is the reason the wound developed and, therefore, option E is also incorrect.\n6. Therefore the likely option would be when the doctor returns to assess the patient'scircumstances and Mia's first aid work herself - this is the case where a doctor'", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "1). The question asks how much Harris, a dog owner, spends on carrots.\n2. Options A, B, C, and D: These options describe variations in the feeding of the dog, but do not help answer the overall question of how much Harris spends on carroots.\n3. Option E: This option describes the cost of a one pound bag of carrots. However, it does not say how many bags Harris buys in one day. \n4. Option F is the correct answer, since this is the only option that mentions the number of carrots a 1 pound carrot would feed the dog (6). \n5. Using this information, we can calculate that if the dog needs 6 carrots every day, Harris will use 192 carrots per year (1 pound carrot / 5 days per week). \n6. Therefore in one year, Harris will spend $384 (192 bags at $2 a bag).\nSo the final answer:  F: $384\n\nInput: What does a frog know about swimming?

The key takeaway is that options B and C cannot describe the time of the weekend as \"the weekend ended\" or \"the weekend was ending\", as this is already answered by the question and answer choices.\n4. Option D: \"weekend was during its ending\" is grammatically incorrect.\n5. Option E: \"the weekend was ongoing\" is not a valid answer.

Max is a person, so we cannot use the term \"friends\" in its literal sense, in which it refers to animals. Since this is not mentioned in the question, we should infer the correct interpretation. The question refers to people of Max is as fast as other friends.\n-3: The correct choice is C. cheetah for the following reasons: \n- cheetah is the fastest mammal in the world and is the only animal to match Max's speed as described in the question.\n- cheetahs are intelligent animals. This makes sense as the answer because even though they're fast and athletically gifted, they're also agile, smart and flexible - which perfectly matches Max's personality.", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "1. The question is regarding how many students can sit at specific desks when there is a maximum of 15 classrooms, with one-third of them having 30 desks and the rest having 25 desks, with only one student per desk.\n2. To calculate the number of students that can be accommodated, we must first calculate the number of desks available and then determine how many students that equates to.\n3. Given that there are 25 desks for every two classrooms that have 30 desk per classroom, the number of available desks are as follows: 15 x 2 = 30 15 x 1 = 15 => Total available desks = 45 desks\n4. Once we have the number of desks, we need to figure out how many students we can accommodate. We do this by taking the number of total desks and dividing it by the number of students that cannot share a desk.\n5. 45 desks / (1-1) = 45 students can be accommodated at either 25 or 30 desks.\n6. Therefore to answer the question, there are 45 students who can be accommodated with a desk.\nSo the final answers are D.\n\nInput:The temperature on a day is between 250102832996 and 250111833997.

{"text": "1. First, let's analyze the options to determine which question is being asked.\n2. We're looking at two answers for \"how many more tails than \nheads\" -- \"46\" and \"65/64\" -- and both choices would be correct if the question was \"how \nmany more heads than tails.\" \n3. However, we know from the context that answer was \"65\", making \n\"46\" wrong, so we can focus only on the second question. \n4. The options are a little weird, however. \n5. The second option is \"65/62,\" which is incorrect because it is the number of additional tails.\n\n6. In the question, \"How many more tails than head did he get?\" \n\"He\" is the subject of the sentence. \n\"Tails\" is a predicate. \nSo, the subject/predicate relation would be \"He\" + \"got\" + \"tails.\" The total number of \"tails\" is 65, so \"got\" will equal \"65.\"\n7. The verb form of \"got\" is \"'d\" so \"got\" will become \"d.\"\n8. Substitute \"d\" for the subject and \"tails\" for the predicate.\n    The original question becomes:\n    How many more a tail than head did he get?\n      Or, alternatively:\n    How many many did he got than a tail?\n9. In this case, subtracting is a good option. \n10. He did more than one more tail and so the total number of tails is 65 - 1 = 64, which is the correct choice.\n11. Therefore, the answer would be \"65-1\" or \"64\".\nSo the final answer would be 64.\n\nInput:The bills of attainder are an important tool for congressional power since they provide for what?\nOutput:1.

{"text": "1 The question asks for the total amount of food that dogs and puppies might eat in a day given specific information about their feeding habits.\n2. Solution:\n3. The total amount of food that the dogs and puppys might eat in a day is 36 pounds.\n4. The total number of dogs and puppies is given as 4+3= 7 dogs and puppies.\n5. Each dog eats two times (2x) as much food as a pup. The total amount of times a dog eats (3x) = 3x = 6 times in a day.\n6. The total amount of meat a dog can eat is 4x. Therefore, if a dog eats 6 times a day (on average) he will eat around 4 pounds of meat (6x) in a day.\n7. We can also use the same logic to calculate the total amount of food for puppies but it is 1.5x, because puppys eat 3x, times 1.5x = 4.5 pounds of food each day.\n8. We can then sum up the total amount of food by both groups to obtain a total (36 x 7) = 252 pounds of combined food. \n9. So, the answer to the question is 252 pounds total. (Note that this solution is based on average intake of food by the dogs and puppis and does not take into account variations in individual eating habits). \nSo the final answer the answer is 252\n\nInput: A woman bought a new laptop for $577.99.

{"text": "1 The question is a counting problem involving the piggy bank, which begins with $104 at the beginning of a year and ends with $66 after a year.\n2 To answer the question, we are looking to understand how much money Randy had before the beginning of the year. By examining the options, we realize that there is much more to the question. Randy makes trips to the store, meaning at each trip, he can only spend two dollars.\n3 To figure this out, we are able to deduce that Randy made $2 at each trip, and therefore, only spent $8 in the year. $8 is much less than $104, meaning that Randy has more than he spent, thus resulting in him having $96 left in his pig when he started. Subtracting $96 from $104 yields a value of $8.\n4 We know $8 is not a valid amount, so we must take into account that Randy spends each trip. We have already concluded that every $2 spent adds only one dollar more to Randy's pig.\n5 Therefore, the money he spent was $16, leaving him with one dollar for a total of $84 in his pig when starting off. \n6 Subtracting 84 from 104, the value is 20, a whole extra penny. However, option E does not add in the penny to the total value of $20, only $19.5\n7 Subtracting one penny from twenty ends up being $19.959, too much to add up.\n8 Therefore, the answer is C: $84.\nSo the final answers is C: $8\n\nInput:When do we start to feel the onset of the cold that we're getting? \nChoices: A: a cold B: sneezing C: runny nose D: mucus E: headache\nOutput: 1 This question is about the symptoms of a cold.\n2 The question asks us to deduce when we first start to feel the symptoms of a common cold.\n3 We first need to understand what is meant by the onset of a cold.

How long will he have to work to earn enough money for the purchase? \nOutput:1. The question is how many hours the man would have to work to earnd enough money to buy 2 pair of shoes. \n2.  To answer this question, we must first determine how much money the man would need to earn to buy the shoes.\n3. Let us assume that each pair of shoe requires a total of $100 to buy which is the total cost of 2 pairs of shoes at $50 Each.\n4. From here, we can see that the man needs to earn $200 i.e. $100 x 2 (for each pair of shoes) in order to buy both pairs of shoes.\n5. Since we know that the man would work for a total of 1 hour, we can see that he would need to earn $2 per hour to buy both pairs of his shoes.\n6. This equates to $200 / 100 = $2.\n7.

It\u2019s better to follow the recipe exactly E. 6. It\u2019s okay to be vague and use your \u201ceye.\u201d\n\nOutput: 1st step 1. The question asks why using a recipe with measurements is better than a rough estimate when it comes to baking.\n2. Option A says there is less room for error and Option B says that it\u2019s difficult to keep count of amounts, which can both indicate that a recipe with clear measurements is a better choice for baking.\n3. Option C says that you will know exactly how much you need, Option D says that convenience and following recipes well can be done with precise measurements, and Option E says that using \u201ceye\u201d can be okay but is probably not as precise.\n4. These options seem to be valid choices when it comes to the use of recipes with measurements for baking.\n5. Therefore, it\u2019s most likely that either Option A or Option B is correct, as they both indicate that precision of measurements is important.\n6. Taking a look at the information we have, the sentence containing \u201cThere is less room for error\u201d is not followed up by any additional information, therefore Option A seems to be the best answer to the question.\nSo the finals answer is A: There is less", "answer": " 8"}

However, the question asks for the remaining requests after 10 days, which is a far greater expanse of time compared to 1 day. To account for this, we must multiply the number of requests by the difference between days (10 x 5 = 50). Since there are 6 requests each day, Maia will have to complete 50/6 of them each day. Therefore, the final number of remaining requests will be 50/6 x 10 = 100.\n4. So, after completing 100 requests in 10 days, the remaining client requests will be 0.\n5.

{"text": "1). Question: How many lawns could Tobias mow if he only charged $5 a lawn?\n2). Answer: In order to answer this question, we can first determine the cost of mowing a lawn, which is $15.\n3). We can then subtract this cost from Tobias' original budget of $95, leaving him with a remaining budget of $80.\n4). This means that Tobias could mow four lawns, as he has an $80 budget divided by the $15 cost of mowing each lawn.\n5). If he mows four lawns, he will have spent $60 in total, leaving him with $25 in change.\n6). Next, we can evaluate how many driveways he would have had to shovel to earn the remaining $25 in change after mowing four lawns.\n7). We know that Tobias earned a $15 profit from mowing a laund, giving him a total income of $60.\n8). This means that Tobis would need to shovel five driveways in order to earn the remaining budget of $25 in change, as he earned a sum of $15 from each lawn while shoveling four driveways.\n9).

What will be heard?\nOutput: Let's first understand each of these terms before we try to answer the question, as these words do mean different things in a recording and audio production context.\n1. \"Tape loop\": In this context, a tape loop is a loop of tape that circulates through the recording and playback devices. It can also be referred to as a \"tape recorder\".\n2. \"Recording source\": This refers to the device that is used to record the audio material. Common recording sources include microphones, sound cards, audio interfaces, etc.\n3. \"Playback mixer\": This device is responsible for accepting the recorded audio, mixing it with other audio elements, and feeding to the monitor. A typical playback mixer would include faders, channels, sends, and other controls that are used to balance the audio levels, add effects, and so on.\n4. \"Monitor\": This is the final destination for the output audio. The monitor usually has a powered amplifier that drives speakers or headphones.\n5. The question asks us how we would hear it in this context.\n6. Let's first understand what are the components of the system and how each of them contributes to the overall output signal.\n7.

The race only lasts 4 days, so we calculate how much distance they have to run in each of the last 3 days to still make it in time, i.e.: the remaining distance\n(30 miles - 12 / 4 )\n= 20/6 = 3.33 miles\n4.

Considered as an independent sentence, the quote by the cat makes no sense, whereas the dog's reply is more logical. \n6. Thus, the dog is the only correct answer.\nSo the final dog is correct\n\nInput:Money was a good investment for our future, but we didn\u2019t use it as well as we could\u2019ve.  Why not?

In this sentence, \"Mario's barber shop\" is the context, and \"when the cost of a haircut increases by 50 percent\" is the statement of relevance (SOAR).\n3. From the statement of relevance, we can assume that the context is of a barber shop and its haircut prices.\n4. There are three choices: A: $24, B: $20, C: $48.\n5. We need to find the haircut cost on Friday, which is the day before Monday when Mario paid $18.\n6. Among the choices, $20 can't be the answer, because $20 is the price of a haircut on Monday.\n7. Similarly, $48 can't be the cost of a hairdo on Friday, because the question mentions that haircut prices are 1.5 times higher on weekends than on weekdays.\n8. To find the most probable answer, we need to use the rule \"Divy by Two\" (D2).\n9. This means that, first, we subtract 50 percent (half) from the cost of a hairstyle on Friday (that is, $20). \n10. Then we divide $20 (the haircut price) by 0.5 (half).\n11. When we perform this calculation, we get $8.\n12. That means that if it was Friday, the price of a hairdo would be $8.\n13.

His parents provide him with the same amount of gifts every other year throughout the five years.\n3. We are asked to determine the number of trains Max has after the fifth year, taking into account the fact that his parents give him gifts double the amount of the number of trains he has.\n4. One logical solution is to follow the same pattern of how many items he received each year. After the fifth year, his parents would give him only 2x more gifts. He received 2 on Christmas day and 2 on his birthday for the 5 years, so his parents give him 4 more every year, and for the final year, he will receive\n5. 4x gifts from his parents during the final year.\n6.

{"text": "1. The question is trying to determine how much cheaper flour is required to minimize Tommy's cost of buying flour.\n2. Let us first start by determining the minimum cost for flour.\n3. We can set up an equation as follows:\n```\nCost- 12 loaves (# of loaves)* (# of pounds per loaf)* (cost of flour)/ (cost of 1 x lb of flour) = LOWER BOUND\n```\n4. LOWER BOUND is the minimum amount in pounds required to not incur Tommy's costs when buying flour. \n5. This is where we use the information given to arrive at an answer.\n6. Based on this formula, the question states: a 10 lb bag of flour costs `10` and a 12 lb bag costs `13` so: `# of lb flour in 10 lb bag - # of lb flour in a bag - cost of 1 lb flour = LOWER BOUN`\n7. ` 4 - 4 - 3 = 1 lb` of flour is required in the cheapest bag of flour.\n8. Now, to minimize the cost, we simply need to buy `12 loaves` at the cheapest bag of `1` lb flour to get the cheapest total cost.\n\nThe final answer is : `1 lb flour + 12 loaves * 1 lb flour/12 lb bag`\n\nSo the final answer will be 13 loaves.\n\nInput: The number of lines of text in a document can be 4, 3, or 2.

One possibility is that they don't want to give Nellie more than 12 sour-ball candies, even if she can eat more.\n5. Another way to interpret the problem is that Nellie can eat any number of sour-ball candis up to or equal to 12, and any number over 12 makes her cry.\n6.

{"text": "1. The question is presenting a scenario where Camilla is trying to make pizza for dinner for 12 people. The question is asking how long it would take her to make the 12 pizzares.\n2. To help with the answer, we must first understand the problem and the resources available to Camilla.\n3. First, we know that it takes 30 minutes for her to make pizza dougn and another 30 minute for the oven to cook the pizza.\n4. The question goes on to say that each batch of pizza doug makes 3 pizzas.\n5. However, we are told that the oven can only handle 2 pizzas per batch.\n6. There needs to be more pizzas made than oven batches in order to fill the oven.\n7. Therefore, as there are 30 minutes per batch, 3 pizzas per batch, but only 2 batches per round, the answer to 12 people is to make 2 batches of dough and 2 batches of pizza per round.  It follows then that there will be 6 batches of dough made in total.\n8. The problem is now clear so we can move on.\n9. The total time it take to make 12 pizzes is 2 batches of 30 minutes, followed by 2 batches of the 30 minutes it takes her to bake the pizzas.\n10. Hence if she makes 2 batches in the first round, it will take her 2*30 + 1*30 = 120 to finish the first batch of dough. And therefore it takes her 60 minutes to make the 3 pizzas in each batch.\n11. There will be 2 batches in each round making a total of 12 batches of pizzas.\n\n12.  Therefore, it will take 2*2*30 = 240 minutes for her to finish the dough and bake the pizzes.\n13. Finally, divide the 240 minutes to get 40 minutes and you learn that she can make 12 pizza pizzas in a timescale of 40 minutes.\n14. So the correct answer is:", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "1) Step 1: Find the unknown value, and write it down. For example, write the variable \"x\" for the unknown value.\n2) Step 2: Label your equation using numbers and letters. For example, if the unknown was \"x\", label your equation \"x + 2 = x + 4\n3) Step 3: Solve by rearranging the equation. So in our example, rearrange \"x x + 2 = x+4\" by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation,\n4) Step 4: Combine like terms. When you look at this equation, the 2+2 on the left equals the 2+2 (x+2) on the right. Add them together and it equals 4.\n5) Step 5: Evaluate expression. Evaluate the equation \"4\" and you will get 2x +4.\n6) Step 6: Substitute known values. Put in the known values that are given. For example,\n7) Step 7: Calculate using the P.E.M.D.A.S. method. Start with P (Put the question in the form: \"I don't know what x is, and then what is x minus 2?\") Use our above equation, write \"x+2=(x+2)\", and answer, x+2 = x+2\n8) Step 8: Add like parts. Add what is above to what is equal in front of x+2. You can see that adding them together gives us x.\n9) Step 9: Re-group terms. The only thing left is to group like terms. All we have left is 2(x+2)\n10) Step 10: Solve. Subtract 56 from both sides, and solve for x. You should get the answer in \"x\"s\n11) Step 11: Check your work.

{"text": "1. The question asks about the number of hours per week Kat trains for boxing, given the information of 1 hour in the strength gym and 4 hours at the boxing gogh. \n2. Since the question is in reference to boxing and Kat is a beginner, we can safely assume that the time spent in the gym is training time and not just exercise.\n3. We also know that she trains strength and boxing for a grand total of 6 hours per week, and we can simplify the exercise times to make it easier for our calculations.\n4. Kat training strength 1 hour 3 times per week equals 3 hours of total time spent working out.\n5. Kat training boxing 4 times a week and 1.5 hours at each time equals 6 hours total per week of boxing training. \n6. Adding both exercise times, Kat works out: 3 hours at the strength gym + 6 hours at the boxing studio equals 9 hours and gives an expected answer of 9 hours.\n7. However, the question asked about the number of hours she trains, so the total number of hours is 12 hours, making her total training time 12 hours per week.\n8.

{"text": "1 First, we need to understand the context of the question. \n2. Annie is trying to figure if it's safe to take her truck, which is prone to skidding if the temperature is below 32 degrees. \n3. When it's minus 8 degrees, the chance of skidding increases by 5%. If she does skid, she has 40% chance of regaining control, and a 60% chance of a serious accident.\n4. Next, we need to find the probability of Annie skidding if the temperatue is 8. If she skids 5% of the time, then the probability of her having a serious accident is 75% (5% times 40% chance, and 60% times 60% chance). \n5. There are three ways Annie might skid:\n1. Her driveway is icy. \n2. The ice was unexpected but it snowed. \n3. The road was icy.\n6. Based on this information, we can find the probability of each: \n1. Her drive wasn't icy: 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 \n2. She had no warning and the ice was unexpected - 0.9 - 0.55 = 0.35  \n3. The road or other route from her house was icy - 0.95 - 0.15 (ice in both her driveway and on the road) = 0.8\n7. So the probability of Annie getting into accident is 0.8 (probability of skid times the probability of accident with skid plus the probabiity of accident with no skid).\n8. So the percentage of Annie getting into serious accident is 0.75 (0.8 times 3%).\n9. Therefore, to answer the question, we need to add Annie's chance of getting into accident (0.8) to 75% of the probability (0.75 x 8 = 6.\n10.

If we look at a different pod it looks like there are 48 pods in a pack.  If we do 39 x 48 then we get 1834. \n6) We subtract 84 from 1834 to get 1750.  Our answer can't be 1750 because he's doing 3 loads a week (3/52) not two.  The most logical answer is 1750/2 which is 875.  To get it down to a nice round number, we have to deduct the odd numbers of 5 that remain.  We do that by adding 875 to 4 leaving 5.  That's 5 packs in a single laundry year.\nSo the final number is A: 875\n\nInput:The last sentence of an essay should...

To accurately answer the question, we must first examine the quantity of calories present in the candy package along with the number of \"servings\" and calculate the number of calories consumed by John.\n3. We can begin by determining the number of servings in a package of candy with 1200 calories each. From the given information, we can conclude that there are three servings in the package. Each serving must contain 1200/3= 400 calories, or in other words, 400 cal.\n4. Since John has consumed half of the candy package, it represents a quarter of the total of three servings. It must mean that he has ingested 100/ fourth of each serving, or a total of 100 cal.\n5. 100/400 or (400/4) means 14.5%. Therefore, if 12 servings (or 100 cal) represents each 10% of an overall number, 50/3= 16.6%. John has eaten 94 cal of the package or 16.6% of its caloric value.\n6.

{"text": "1.  This question refers to a cut pizza with pepperoni slices, and the task is to find out how many slices are left in the pizza after Lard gives a slice to Jelly and drops a slice.\n2.  It is assumed that the pizza was divided into 8 equal slices before it was cut in half to produce the 2 slices Lard gave to Jelly. These slices were further divided into 4 halves, leaving just 4 slices on each of the 4 slices Lard picked up. It should be noted that while Jelly received 2 slices, Lard received these slices and the 4 leftover slices.\n3.  The total number of pepperoni slices on the pizza before Lard gave a slice to Jelly should have been 8 slices(before the slice fell off). The number of slices was then divided into the number of slices received by Lard and Jelly, i.e 2 and 4 respectively.\n4.  The total number in Lard\u2019s 2 slices should have been 4 slices(before the pizza was cut in half). After the pizza was cut into 8 slices, the total number in these 8 slices is therefore 16 but Lard receives only 4 of them.\n5.  Thus, the final total number of slices on Lard\u2019s slice should have been 6. To verify this, if we subtract 6 from 8(the original number of slices), we get a result of 2 slices. This indicates that 2 slices fell off when Lard picked up the slice.\n6.  Hence, the final answer is 6.\nSo the final output is 6", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "1) Answer: Andy loses both lawsuit 2) The question is asking about the probability of a specific event happening.\n2) Option A is 50%, which means he wins half of the time.\n3) Option B is 20%. This equals the probability of winning one of the lawsuits times the probability of winning the other lawsuit. A 30% chance multiplied by a 50% is 15%. Multiplying the number 15% by 100% gives the number 15. Therefore, B is 15%.\n4) Option C is 65%. This calculation is based on the lawsuit with the lower payouts. The payouts are both $5,00,00, but the odds of winning the first one is 3 out of 10 while the odds of winning second is 2 out of 5. Hence, we multiply.03 probability times.01 probability which equals.0006 probability. Multiplying by 100 per percent gives 6.5 percentage.\n5) Option D is 10%. This is the probability of winning none of the lawsuits. This equals multiplying.40 percent (chance of winning none of them) x 1 percentage (chance of winning all of them).\n6) Option E is 5%. This equals multiplying the.40 percent(chance of losing none of them) times the.60 percent (chance to have a tie).\n7) So A is the wrong answer, B is 10% higher than C, C is 65% higher than D and D is 10% lower than E.

There are no constraints or limits for the number of pints the vampire can suck from each person, so it can suck any amount of pints per person, as long as they are the same. 3.) To be more succinct with the question, we need to find out how many people the vampire needs to sustain his consumption of 7 gallons of liquid. 4.) We need to solve for the number of people the vampire has to suck per day, because we've already established that a vampire can sucks as many pints from each person, as long as the pints are in an integer. 5.) We also need to account for the fact that if the number pints in a gallon is greater than that of the number of pints contained by a person, the vampire will not need to suck from another person. 6.) Therefore, we need to find how many gallons the vampire can contain by a person in order to account for the fact the vampire will only need to suck from other people if his pints from that gallon per person is greater than pints from a gal- pints per person. 7.) We will also use order of operations and the laws of math (e.i. multiply and divide and then calculate the answer) to solve this problem. 8.)

Since a day on Mars is nearly the same as a day on earth, sunrise and sunset, therefore, are almost always visible from the surface of Mars.\n2 Uranus' year is only slightly longer than Earth's - 84,000 Earth days to complete one rotation. It takes the sun about 84 Earth years to appear to move once around Uranus, so sunset and sunrised are, therefore, only visable around the equinoxes and solstices. In between these equinox, they occur very fast and could easily be missed while viewing them from Uranus.\n3 Saturn has a year that is approximately 29 Earth years.

Option b does not make sense, because in each day of selling, he had enough fish to fulfill one of them, which means that it is impossible to sell 100 % on a daily basis.\n5. Option c involves subtraction and addition, but we do not know the percentage of fish that are spoiled, so it is impossible to calculate the result.\n6. Option d is another subtraction example and can be easily resolved. Once he has sold half of his stock, only half of the other fish will spoil because he has 200 more to replace them (50 spoiled in the previous step, followed by 100 regular fish). Now, once he sells and replaces all remaining regular fish, as well as half of the spoiled ones, he will have 60 regular fish left. The other 140 fish are regular fish that he has sold but is yet to use, so 20 of them will spoil, as these are the 140 left in inventory minus the 120 sold and minus the 40 he has bought.

{"text": "1. One of the steps to solving this problem involves identifying the total number of people who can potentially be seated in the chairs available.\n2. The information given is that \"There are six chairs, each with five people in each row, in a church.\" This suggests that there are at least 30 people in total who can potentially be seating.\n3. Next, we will need to determine the number of rows to which the six chairs can be assigned, which is 20, as given in the information (i.e. the church had 20 rows of seats and each row has 6 chairs in it, that makes 20 rows available for the 30 potential seating).\n4. Therefore, the total number of chairs in total is 120, and the total number of seats available for the 35 people is 180.\n5. To calculate the number of people there have to be in the chairs to fill up the seats, we simply have to divide 35 by 180, which is about 0.2(=180/180).\n6. This means that the church has to be filled at least by 0.2 (or 6 people) people to have all seats taken.\n7. Thus, the question asks for the number of people who need to sit in the chains so that the church is full.\n8. This is 6 (0.2) people.\nSo the final answers are 6.\nInput: How many chocolate chip cookies are there in an extra-large, 24 count box? Choices: 1. 24 2. 72 3. 48 4. 21 5. 96\nOutput:1.

They estimate that children can eat half an omelet, older kids can eat an omelet, adult can eat two omelets and the senior can eat 1.5 omelets. The club will get extra eggs assuming that 2 eggs are used for each omelet.\"\n3. The question asks how many eggs they need buy to cover the number of omelets they expect to feed to the ticket holders.\n4. We can define the following variables:\n\ni. Small Children: The number of ticket holders who are small children. \nii. Older Children: The number of omelets small children can eat.\niii. Adult: The number of ometers older children can eat. \niv. Older Adults: The number of oment older children can eat.\nv. Half-Egg: the omelets that require one egg.\nvi. Whole-Egg: the omlets that require one-and-a-half eggs.\nvii. Tickets: the total number of tickets sold for the breakfast.\n\n5. We know that there are 45 small children, as well as 35 older children, 75 adults, and 37 seniors.\n6. Therefore the total number of omelets is:\ni. half-omelet = (45 + 35) x (1 + 0.5) = 45 x 1.5 = 67.5\nii. whole-omelet = (35 + 75) x (1.5 + 2) = 35 x 3.5 = 93.5\niii. half-omelet + whole-omelet = 67.75 + 93.5 = 161.25\n\n7.

{"text": "1. The question is posed in the form of a mathematical equation, with the variables being the cost of seed, fertilizers and pestics, and labor, as well as the total cost of buying the goods and the profits of the farmer after selling a certain number of bags.\n2. The farmer can increase the profit by selling more bags, but each bag must sell for a price 10% higher in order to cover the costs of cultivating the field.\n3. To solve this equation, we can first rearrange the variables in a way that it can be easily plugged into a formula to find the number of bags that should be sold by the farmer in the equation. Let's call them x, y, and z:\n$$\n\\text{Number of bags sold} = 2000 +\\frac{50 y}{100} +\\frac{35 x}{100}  +\\frac{15 z}{100} =\\frac{5650}{(100-y-z)}\n$$\n4. The farmer can now decide how many bags of corn to sell to hit his targeted profits of 10%, which we can find by plugging the known variables into the formula and solving for y and z.\n5. With the equation as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{565}{500+35+15} =&1.74 + 35 + 15 &=1.74 +50 \\\\\n\\frac{50}{565}=\\frac{500}{500+15+35}=\\frac{15}{1+1+35}&=0.07 + 35 +15 &=30.79 \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\end{equation}\n6.

{"text": "1. Aisha adds a certain amount of songs every week.\n2. By keeping track of how many songs are already on her mp3 player and tracking the new ones she adds, we can determine how many songs she currently has on her mp3 player at any given week. We can use this data to determine the number of songs she has in total.\n3. The question asks \"after a while\". Since the total number of songs is not specified we can estimate that the number of songs is large, which indicates that the total number of songs would increase very quickly. This suggests that many of the songs are redundant in nature and can be discarded.\n4. Thus, we can assume that there are songs that can be discarded without affecting the total number of songs.\n5. Let's consider removing 50 duplicate songs each week. We can set these variables:\nx = total songs x' = total songs * (1+y) y = number of different songs removed each week\n6. From the problem statement, we know that x - x' is not less than 0.\n7. Given that after x weeks have passed, we can calculate the number of duplicate songs: x' = 500 * (494). There are a total of 988 duplicate songs on the music player.\n8. Since there is not a finite number of songs in Aisha's collection, we can assume that the total number of different songs is infinite. This indicates that removing duplicate songs will not affect the total number of unique songs.\n9. There are no more restrictions on the total number of unique and distinct songs Aisha owns.\nSo the final analysis is x = 988", "answer": " 2,950"}

This is equal to practicing twice as long, which means he will have 4 times the practice time currently, which is equal to tripling it, which means he will triple.\n5: He will go from 20 to 40, double back to 40, then triple for the last time to 120, which makes 3\u00d720=60, then three times that gets to 180.\n6: Therefore, Johnny will have three times the practice time he currently has after 180 days.\nSo the final step is this:\n7: Since the initial plan was to double as of 20 more days (180-20=160), we can conclude that Johnny will have 3 times as much time from 7 days after the initial plan.\n8: Therefore, Johnny's new plan to triple his practice time will take him a total of 560 days.\nSo, the final answer is 560.\n\nInput: What is an example of a person doing something just for the sake of doing it?

{"text": "1.) The question contains the following assumptions:\n2.) There are six unicorn,\n3.) Everywhere a unicork steps, four flowers spring up,\n4.) They are going to walk all together, \n5.) They walk together 9 kilometers,\n6.) Each unicorn move 3 meters forward with the step\n7.) Therefore, given these assumptions, the question is asking how many flowers bloom as a result of their walking.\n8.) As an example, let's take the initial question and rephrase it in simpler terms:\n9.) The statement \"Everywhere a unicorns steps, four flowers spring\" means that for every unicorn who walks, four flowers will bloom, resulting in a total of 24 flowers.\n10.) Given, that each of the unicorns walks 3 meters with each step, the total distance covered by the unicorn is:\n11.) Therefore, the total amount of flowers bloomed is: [24 * 3] = 72 flowers.\n12.) By calculating this way, we should be able to easily answer the main question with the assumption that the total distance walked by each unicorn is the same, which is what we are given.\n13.) The other assumption is: Each unicorn walking together, which means that each unicorn walks at the same time. \n14.) If we assume that the unicorns walk in such that each unicorn in the back walks for the unicorn in front to walk, then we will see different results on how the question is answered.\n15.) Specifically, if the second unicorn back walks for the first unicorn forward to walk, then each unicorn would move 2 meters with each step, which would result in 48 flowers blooming,\n16.) Since the unicorns are moving 3 meters forward with every step, the flowers would bloom every 3/4 step, resulting in the number of flowers blooming as:\n17.) This means that there are more flowers blooming than the initial answer of 72, which is [24 *(3/4)] = 36 flowers,\n18.) Therefore it is possible that different answers are possible if the question has different assumptions, which is why the question needs to ask", "answer": " 72000"}

The possible causes of dementia are listed below:\n2 The four major categories of dementia are vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Lewy Body disease.\n3. The most common types of dementia occur with increasing age, with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) being most common.\n4. The signs and symptoms of Lewy body dementia include cognitive decline, movement problems, and visual hallucinations.\n5. Parkinson's dementia can occur as a result of the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, leading to symptoms that are like Lewy body dementias in several respects, including dementia related cognitive symptoms and progressive movement disorders.\n6. Frontotemporal dementias are caused by the accumulation of abnormal proteins or the loss of brain cells in the frontal lobes (FTD), or the loss of cells in both the frontal and temporal areas of the brain (FTDTD).\n7. Lewy Body Dementias: Parkinson's and FTD are diseases that cause dementia, while Lewy body disease causes the build up of abnormal alpha-synuclein protein clumps in the brain causing dementia.\n8.

{"text": "1) This is easy to answer if we were not given any constraints. Say Jamie\u2019s last name is X, Bobbi\u2019s is Y, and Samantha\u2019s is Z. If each name ends the same way as XZY, we can say that the last two letters are the same. Then, subtracting 2 letters, we can conclude that Samantha\u2019s name has 3 letters. However, we cannot determine the value of XY because the problem gives no additional information.\n2) After identifying letter X as Samantha\u2019s, we have to subtract 2 letters and solve for Y. We could do this with a system of two equations:\n2XY = 3XZ \\ ZY = YZ\nFrom here, the only way that XY and YZ equal 2XY is if X = Z. Also, from our first equation, we find that 2ZY = 3ZZ. Plugging in our new constraint that we found in step 2, we can use algebra to solve for the value of 2XY:\n3ZZ = 2XY(Z\\Y)\n3YZ = 2XZZ\nY = 4 \\ X = 6\n\nSo the final answer Z = 4, and since it takes two letters off, the answer for Jamie is 6 letters.

Tara does not pay additional $20 for down payment, so there is no additional balance and she will pay all $4000 at the end of the payment plan.\n6. Tara has not paid the first 4 months' payments so it is not necessary to include the balances of those installments(which are only $2500), so the result is $1900(her balance after 4 months).\nSo the final answer for question 2 is $190\n\nInput:The number of votes that a senate candidate received after an election was 85000, whereas the number of eligible voters was 1.5 million.

Subquestion 1: How many kilograms to lose, and how many kilograms did lost by the first person?\n4. Subquestion 2: How many kilogram are left, and how much kilogram did the second person lost?\n\n5. answer: if we think about subquestions 1 and 2 together, we can see that there is a 4-3-1 relationship.\n6. the number of people left (2) is the number of the third person, and the number of the first person is 1 more than the 4-3-2-1, that is, the total lost weight.\n7.

From the statement: \"She bought the $80 card for her grandmom, but only 200 dollars of it was available for her grandmom to use.\"\n3. We need to find the total money that is available for use for her grandmom.\n4. The grandmom bought a $80 gift card, so $80 is the base.\n5. 200 dollars was available for use, so 200 dollars is the part with the extra.\n6. We need three equations; a base, extra, and a difference, so we can easily find the total money that she can use:  \n7. 80 + 200 = 280.\n8. That means a total of $280 can be used for her grandmom's gift.\nSo the final Answers are 280\n\nInput: If the person's bags weigh less than 30 pounds, she can take two bags on the  plane, but if the bags weighs more than 50 pounds, the person will have to pay for extra luggage.\nOutput:  \n1.

By doing so, we can compare the amount of spending with the amount of change he brought.\n3) Therefore, the final amount of ounces of sods Peter bought is 3 ounces, since 2/0.25 = 8, which is 10 more than the amount of change he was left with: $2/.25 = 8 oz. of soda.\n4) So the final answer is 3 ounes\n\nInput:Which of the following is the opposite of \"still\"?

Option B: \"He will need 3 cups.\"  This choice assumes that Herman only needs 3 cups of food for all three months, which is only true  if no growth occurs throughout the \n3. months.  However, Herman will likely need more food as the birds grow, so the answer choice is not correct.\n4. Option C: \"He will need about 6 cups.\" This answer choice is inaccurate because it assumes that the birds will only eat 3 cups per month, not including additional growth which will likely happen throughout the three-month period.\n5. Option D: \"He will need at least 9 1/2 cups.\" This statement is not specific enough as the correct answer must be an integer, and the closest answer possible is 7 due to Herman's feeding schedule.\n6. Option E: \"He will need more than 14 cups.\" This answer is too vague and does not consider that the question requires Herman's feed to be in a specific ratio.\n7. The correct answer is A: \"Herman will need  7  cups of food for the three months.\" This is accurate because it states the exact amount of food (7 cups) for the entire period, and is the only answer that considers the birds' growth.\n8.

I ended up missing my first two payments.  If I paid an extra $5000 on the lease, would you agree that the penalty for missing a monthly payment was unreasonable?\nOutput:1.) The question is about penalty for missing monthly payment on a lease.\n2.) Missing two payments on a lease is a serious infraction.\n3.) It might be reasonable to charge a penalty for missing the first payment, but it is unreasonable to penalize the tenant for consecutive missed payments.\n4.) Paying extra $500 is a way for tenant to satisfy landlord, but that amount is insufficient to cover up for multiple missed payment.\n5.)

The question asks how many meals she will carry when she's delivering 27 total. 2) First, it's important to note that the question is asking how many packages she will deliver when she's carrying 27 total.\n3) To find the number of packages she delivers, we need to take the 8 ratio from the question and multiply by 27, the total number of packages and meals she is delivering. \n4) Since the ratio is 8:27, this means that 8 packages is 27% of the 27 total number, so one-fourth of the package deliveries is 39, divided by 2, for a total of 19.5 packages.\n5) This means that she is delivering a total of 105.5 packages: 1:39 (1 x 27%) + 8:27 (8 x 27%).\n6) To summarize, we use a 8:27 ratio to answer the question.\nSo the final answe is 105. 5\n\n#### Solution:\n\nInput: Angela is a bi-ped courier in New York City. She takes double the amount of packages as meals. The question asks how much of the total will be the meals when she delivers 27 packages and meals combined.\nOutput: \n1) Angela is what is called a \"bike messenger\" in New York City, meaning she typically takes deliveries on her bicycle rather than a car. As she takes these deliveries, she has to pick up two things - packages and meals. \n2) The question asks how many \"meals\" she will take when she's dealing with 27 total deliveries. \n3) First, it helps to clarify the question, as the phrasing sounds similar to saying \"Meals and deliveries\" when in this case, the word \"meals\" should be in quotations. \n4) This means that the question is actually asking how many meals she takes when she makes 27 packages. \n5) Since packages are taken in pairs, the question is essentially asking that out of all the 27 total", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "1) Initially, the question asks for Ariella's son's saving account and Daniella's son's savings.\n2) Now, the question then gives the difference in each of these accounts, $200.\n3) The question also states that Ariella's account has a interest rate of 10%.\n4) Finally, the question asks about Ariella's money after 2 years when Daniella's account has $400.\n5) We can conclude from all the information that Ariella's money is larger than Daniella's after 2 years.\n6) Now, we have to figure out what Ariella's money becomes. \n7) Ariella's money ($200 more) is a constant factor, so we can simply take it away from the total to find out how much Daniella's money has become.\n8) As $200 more is subtracted from $400, it means Daniella's money after 1 year has become $200 smaller and it will continue to be $200 smaller after 2 years. Since, the money is becoming smaller, Daniella's money will reach zero at the end of second year.\n9) Since Daniella's saving account has reached zero, Ariella's saving account will get double of what he had in first year which is $200 + $200 = $400. \n10) The question is asking about Ariella's saving after two years.

{"text": "1) The question is asking about the number of miles that Jerome will ride on the 14th day in order to accomplish the 150- mile bicycle trip, which he wants to complete over 12 days. \n2) According to the question, Jerome wants to ride 150 miles over 12 days, and he is riding 12 miles for each of the 12 days. This means that he needs to travel an additional 12 miles each day to complete the 150 miles, which is the goal. \n3) The 14th day represents the last day of the trip, and therefore, the answer is 12 - (12 x14/12), which equals 13.5. \n4) That means that he is riding 3.5 additional miles on the 14 day to complete his goal.\n5) The equation to solve this problem is 150/12 - (150 x13/12), which simplifies to 12 + 3.5 - (150/13), which simplifies to (12/13) + (12 x 13). This yields the answer of 13.5 as the number of miles that he will ride on the 3.5 days to complete his 71 miles.\n6) As a result, the correct answer is choice E: 13.5 miles \nSo the final answer must be (12/12) + (150) - (12 x 3.5), which is 71\n\nInput: When is the next full moon?

The number of hours he watched that day is 4 hours and 20 minutes, or 4.5 hours. It is more efficient to express the hours watched as a decimal, so 4.5 hours is equal to 4.5/60 hours.\n4.This is equal to 0.0725 hours.\n5.As Tuesday is already taken into account, we only need to be concerned with the movie-watching on Wednesday.\n6.If I assume Wednesday as the first day, then he watched a total of x movies on that day.\n7.This statement is equivalent to y x, where y is a constant.\n8.Using the rules for solving for unknown variables, we can multiply both x and y on both sides.\n9.Now subtracting the two sides, we will obtain -0.363x.\n10.Substituting x for y, it becomes x - 0.363(x).\n11.As the problem asks for the maximum number of full length movies, we will look for the number that will result in a negative value.\n12.Thus, -0.36x is the maximum number of movies he can have watched.\n13.Therefore, the answer is -0.36 hours. \nSo the final answer should be 3.5", "answer": " 9"}

We need calculate how much profit the production company made taking 40% of $120 million and $3.5 times that amount in revenue. \n3. We want to know how much profit the production made from the movie. We know that the cost of producing the movie was 60 million dollars. We also know that the production company kept 40% of the revised total revenue of $60 million and $3,500,000,00 that the movie made in total (60% of the initial revenue and 40% of new/total revenue). \n4. The new revenue is 1.5 times the original revenue of $6,000, but you also need to subtract the total production cost. \n5.

We will use the averaging strategy with each crane's height and the building's height to calculate the percentage difference between these numbers.\n3.) We start by setting up the average of the crane height against the building height, which can both be calculated using the given information. \n4.) Thus, using the given information, we have: (crane height)/(total of crane height)/ (building height)/(total of building height) = (228^2)/2/ (140^2)/2 => (4816 /2)/2400= (2006.5/4) \n5.) After simplifying, we have an equation that allows us to determine the value of the expression using algebraic operators by making the value equal to 0.5, which is the percentage difference between the two numbers: 4816/4 = 1204 = 140/4 \n6.) We can see that the percentage of the crane being taller than the building is (140/4)/100, and since we can round 140/100 to 1.4, we can conclude that the average percentage of the crane's height relative to the building's height is (1.4/4)= 0.03625 = 0.037.\n7.)

That force reduces the boat\u2019s ability to actually travel through the water, which slows it down.\n\u2022 As a boat approaches a water skier, its wake forces the skier to lean even more to one side, making the skier roll and spin.

This means he has 4 days x 10= 40 hours worth of sick days per year.\n5) Therefore, we know that the entire 20 sick days and 20 vacation days he can take cover a total of 82 hours.\n6) To translate this into days, divide the total number of sick days by 8 which is 5.25. We then add 10vacation days on the top of this 5.25, giving us 15.25 days which is 78 hours.\n7) However, since each day covers an 1/8th day, this means that there are 5 whole days in each of these 78 hours. \n8) Therefore, Mark has 5x10 (sick days) + 10 (vacation days) = 120 whole days in their entirety. \n9) To translate this into the number of hours for each day, multiply this (120) by 8 (for 1/8th of a day) to get 1,200 hours.\n10) Finally, for each of these (120) days x 8 (hours within each day as 1/8th) = 1,208 hours or 504 full days. \nSo the final answer: 1208 is the total hours' worth of days.\n\nInput:At a grocery store", "answer": " 80"}

This means that for every 1900 people added to the population, the average life expectancy increases by 24 days (in other words, an average additional lifespan of 24 days per 1900 residents).\n3 We can calculate this by subtracting the new average life expectancy, **4.43** days, from the original average life expectancy **44.43 days**. **44.4 - 4.43**. This reduces the original average down to **40** days. So for every 19 added to the population, life expectancy was increased by 2 days on average. \n4 The next part of the question states that the number of people in the population is currently 5735.

Since it is not specified, let us consider it as a percentage.\n3. So, 1 unit means 100 percent, 1/2 unit means 50 percent, and 1/4 unit means 25 percent etc.\n4. To simplify the problem, a box containing 10 units of each type of cholate bar would be ideal.\n5. From the question, the box contains 25 bars of white chocolate, 25 bars of dark chocolate, 12.5 bars of milk chocolate with nut, and milk chocolate bars respectively.\n6. Thus, the number of white chocolate bars can be calculated as 10% of the total number of bars = 25*10% = 2.5.\n7. The number of milk chocolate bars can now be calculated as 12.5% of the total number = 25*0.125 = 3.125.\n8. The number of dark chocolate bars can also be calculated as 6.25% of the total bars = 25*.0625 = 1.5625.\n9. The number of milk foam with nuts bars can be calculated as.75% of the total bar = (25-9.375)*.5 = 3.5625\n10. As we know that 100=100*100%. 100-100 = 0%.

Understanding the question: We are given specific parameters (specific day of the week to the end of the week) and asked to come up with a specific answer, but we are not given any specific requirements or conditions (weight, gender, other dietary needs, etc.) to take into consideration. So we need to think carefully and strategically about our approach in figuring out the answer. \n3.) Creating an equation: This is a math word problem, so we should create an equation so we can solve for the part that remains unknown (cup per day). We can create a simple mathematical equation:\ncups of vegetable per day = 2 * (8) * (7 days)- (2 * days she has already eaten) \n\n4.) Solving the equation: We are asked to figure out the specific cups per day that Sarah should eat of vegetables to meet the daily minimum requirement for the whole week; the most efficient way of finding out is by subtraction:\ncups of food per day = cups per day * 7 days (Sunday to Thursday) \u2013 (cups per day * 2) * 7 days (Monday to Thursday), not including Friday or Saturday where she already ate cups of vegetables, which we already know \n5.)

{"text": "1. The question is posed as an arithmetic sequence, meaning that the difference between two consecutive elements in a series is always the same.\n2. Solving an arithmetic sequence involves finding the common difference (D) in the series and the total number of elements in the series (n).\n8. Here, the common difference is 1, so D = 1. \n9. The total number of elements in this series is n = 14, which can be determined by adding the total number of elements on each side. \n10. With this information, we can use the formula to find the sum of the series:\n\n\u2211(n) = n\u2081 + n\u2082 +... + n\u2081\u2084\n\n11. In our case, this equals 1 + 5 + 15 + 5 = 26\n12. However, because there are repeating elements in the series (3+4+5+4+3+4+5, for example), we have to include all of the elements in the repetition. \n13. By dividing every element by 3 (except for the first element, which is 1), we can add all repeating elements.\n14. This brings our total sum down to 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 14, because we have included 14 repeating elements.\n15. There are a total of 3 repeating elements (3+5+3+4+3+5), so we add 3 to the total (14) to get our final answer of 17, as the combined total number of hats Vaishali has is 17.\n16.

When given a percentage, the calculation to determine the amount of that percentage is to multiply the figure by 100 and then divide by 100. \n3.  The amount of space remaining in the birdhouse will be 72%, and the name is \"ventilation\" because the remaining space is where air can flow in and out. \n4.

The phrase \"man apart\" implies that he is unique or stands out from the crowd. This doesn't seem to fit the context, as the man is described as having fewer peers and less money despite having few words. \n4. The phrase \"lonely man\" implies that the man is alone and isolated with few people around him. This also doesn't seem to describe the man, as he is described as standing apart from the crowd, which is another way of saying he is unique or distinct.\n5. The phrase \"a hermit\" implies that the man lives in solitude and isolation and chooses to spend his time alone or in seclusion, such as in a cave or forest.

B: his employer's $30 per sink, $70 per shower, and $145 per toilet.  C: a neighbor's $65 per toilet, and $120 per sink. \n4)  In Choice A the question states that the plumber will be filling a total of 6 sinks and 4 toilets, and the question asks how much money the plumber can make if only he can choose one of these three options.

Choice B states that the plumber earns $160 per toilet for a total of two toilets and $70 for each sink.

Ivan has a bird feeder that has two cups of bird seed, which can each feed 14 birds weekly, but Ivan has to constantly chase away a hungry squibrel that steals half of the birdsead from the feeder, so it is unclear how many birds the feeder feeds.\n2.The bird feed can be set at maximum (2) or minimum (0).\n3.To find the total number of birds fed,  total number of birds = sum of half cups of birdseed and the two cups of bird seeds.\n4.The half a cup of bird seed are stolen each week, so the total number of bird fed = (2 cups of bird seed )+ ((2*2 cups of birdseed - (1/2 cups of bird feed)) = 17 cups of bird seated.\n5.The total number of birdseed fed = 17 cu/seads x 14= 238 birds. So total number of bird fed is 238 birds which is equal to 149 birds.\n6.The squirrel steals 1/2 cup of bird seed out of two cups, so the squirrels takes 1/4 cup of both cups, and there are 144 birds fed.\n7.The number of birds in one hour is 14.\n8. The number of birds in 8-hour-long day is 112 since squirrels comes twice/day time to steal the feeder.\n9. Hence, the number of birds at Ivan's bird feeder is 112 divided by 14 which is approximately 804 birds.\n10. Since 800 is a factor of 1544, so we can say that Ivan's bird feeds 77% of the birds in the world ( 2/700\u2248 0.8888.. %\u2248 88.88%).\n11. Hence, Ivan's bird feather feeds one third (1/3) of the world, which is 36 million (1556\u2217 0.246 ).\nSo the final answer should be 246.7 million birds.\n\nInput:", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "The problem is asking how many packs of ten cupcakes should Jean buy to give 100 individual cupcakes to 100 orphaned children. \n1. As the number of packs of ten cupcake is required, the solution to this problem will be equal to the amount of 10 cupcake needed. \n2. In order to solve this question, you will need to find out the number of cupcakes, 4 packs * 15 cupcake. \n3. Therefore, let's use this number : 4 * 15. So the solution would be 60 cupcakes to get 10 packs of 1-cupcake.\n4. Note: To solve the problem, you multiply the number of 15 cupcake because you need 10 or greater to get 10-cupcake packs. \n5. This is because if you multiply or subtract fractions, you will get the same answer for the denominator. \n6. This is because the total number will always be the same.\n7. For the final step, let's say 60 cupcake is the solution to this problem. We will multiply the number of cupcake, Jean needs to get 100 orphans: (60 * 2) The resultant is 120 cupcakes \n8. So let's say we need to get 120 cupcake. As we already answered for the amount of 15 cup, let's do the next step. \n9. The next step would be (120/9) the resultant is 13 packs of cupcake.\n10. So what we do? We divide 13 into two, 13/2. As we will get the same result, it means it's not the best solution.\n11.

The first step is to understand how many students are present in school on any given day. This can be estimated based on the total number of students (40% of 100 = 40) and how many students are absent (60%).\n4. The second step is to determine how many students are present at school out of the total sum of present and absent students (40% + 60%).

It could be associated with alcohol-related parties that involve partaking in heavy drinking.\n5) Option C is a pep talk from friends, which could lead a man to feel insecure about his thinning hair and cause him to grow a beard. \n6) Option D is no one knows, which is not a probable answer because the question mentions a particular outcome (man with beard).\n7) Option E is absence of a razor, which is the most plausible answer as this directly reduces or impedes the ability of someone to shave off their beard.\n8) While genetic makeup or alcohol-related parties could cause a man to stop shaving, it is unlikely that their absence alone is enough to make someone grow a beard as the main trigger for growing a beard is the inability to shave from a lack of razors, given that most men prefer to shave their facial hair.\n10) Therefore, the correct answer based on the information given in", "answer": " 71"}

Now that we have all the information we need, we can calculate the total number of remaining hard hats in the truck. There are 26 yellow hats remaining, plus 15 green hats and 24 yellow hats plus 10 pink and blue huts = 10 pink hard hats + 12 blue hard hats = 22 pink hard hats. \n6.)

The sentence says Sara said something, and Sara is saying she loves shopping for ________. The blank is intended to make the reader do some critical thinking. \n2.  None of the alternatives is what Sara said. Only \"shoes\" fits this part correctly.\n3. The sentence says Sara \"said something.\" The choices for \"something\" must all be things that people might say. Only \"shopping for\" fits here.\n4. The sentence says that Sara loves shopping for....\" The choices should be things she might buy in a store. This leaves us with only \"shoes\" and \"clothes\" as answers. \"Jackets\" and \"jeans\" will need a possessive adjective to make them fit.\n5. \"Sara\" suggests that it is speaking about a female. \"She\" is an appropriate word to use for a female, and it fits better than \"he\" would.\n6.

{"text": "10.\n2. There are many ways to solve this problem. Some possible approaches include grouping the candies by type, finding the total cost of each type, then totalling all of the types together.\n3. However, the easiest and most logical way to approach the problem is to use the rule of addition.\n4. The rule of addition states that \"the sum of any group of numbers is equal to the sum of each member in that group, plus the sum of each member after that\".\n5. In other words, find the cost of each type of candy, and then add up the total cost of each.\n6. To start, write down all the values that you know.\n7. The question asks, \"How much did the unicorne pi\u00f1ata and the candies cost together?\"\n8. Remember that in mathematics, \"together\" is represented by the symbol \"+\".\n9.

Choices: A: 2 B: 4 C: 11 D: 31 E: 50\nOutput: 1, we can only choose numbers here.\n2. There are four basic operations in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as mentioned in the question.\n3. In binary, addition means to add ones and zeroes as they are the only two digits. Subtraction is also carried out in the same manner, although the digit sum changes with each subtraction operation.\n4. In the binary system, division is usually performed modulo 2 and division by zero is not defined.\n5. In the ternary system, addition is similar to that of binary but the digit sum changes with division and multiplication operations.\n6. The digits also change with each operation, though the digit with a higher position has a higher power.\n7. Since division is not defined in the system, 101 in it is not divisible by 10. Also, division by zero is not allowed, as the question suggests.\n8. Hence an option can be chosen that does not involve division. \n9. Option C and Option E: 101 is not divisible by either 10 or 50.\n10. Option B: 101 mod 4 = 1 or 3\n11. Thus, the only remaining option is Option A: 101 = 2\n12.

We also know that he is on a diet to reduce his weight by 3 kg each month, leading up to the fight day.\n3.) Here is a rule for the math: if you know your weight at a point in time and you know how much you weigh on some other date (either immediately before or after), you can simply subtract your initial weight from the weight after that particular date. E.g. if your weight is 100 on the 1st of April, and a month later on the 1st May is now equal to 97, then you were on a diet.\n4.)

Suppose he is on a diets and has already managed to lose 3 kg by the 1st of June, then he must weigh 94(kg) (rather than 97) on the 1st July (the day of the fight).

Jeff's average skipping score of every round would be 3x. It is unknown how many times Jeff skipped in the last round, but if we are going to find Jeff's average skips per round, we need to find his average skips divided by the total he had.\n5. Since we are working with the assumption that Sam skipped 15 times in every round, his overall average skips per round would be 15/4 or 3.75x.\n6. Therefore if we subtract the average Sam's round completion by the average Jeff completed - 3.75 by 3.75 we get an answer of 3.75.\n7. Finally, we then divide that answer by the number of rounds Sam completed (4), and we get 9.375.\nSo the final round should be 3.75 = 9.37 rounds\nSo the final answer should be 27 rounds.\nSo 9.37/4\nSo Final answer is 23", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "1) Start with an initial total of 50 fish that you can split evenly between the 2 tanks (we can subtract 10 for the blowfish in the 2nd tank, leaving us 40 fish in addition to the 26 remaining).\n2) Since we have 100 fish and initially 40, we have an initial total of 140 fish for the two tanks.\n3) After some fish have left, we still have 130 fish to split between the 2 tents.\n4) By the end of the problem, we know we have exactly 100 fish total between two tanks, so half of the starting 130 should end up in each tank (rounded to the nearest integer, since there is no need to subtract anything to the hundred).\n5) Since there's still the initial 26 blowfish that were removed after the fish have taken the tanks up to 100 fish between the initial 2 tanks, we take 50-(two thirds of ten) = half of the 140+26=126 fish. (Remember, we subtracted 10 when we subtracted the blowfish the first time.\n6)  In this way, we have 63 fish in each tank, so the answer is 63, because there are exactly the same number of clown fish in each tank. \nSo the final answer to the problem is C: 63\n\nInput: She was sure her mother would like to buy ________ at the store.

{"text": "1 The problem statement presents a challenge of basic numerical computation.\n2. The question is asking \"how many hours did he watch tv\",  where \"tv\" refers to his watching of Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune and the duration time of each.\n3. To begin solving the problem, it's necessary to first understand the time involved in each episode.\n4. For Jeopardy, the duration is 20 minutes, which is provided.\n5. For Wheel of Fortune, there is an implicit assumption that the episode is 40 minutes long because the statement of 2 episodes being twice as long implies that the episodes are 20 minutes each.\n6. Therefore 2 episodes of WF are 40 min x 2 = 80 min in total.\n7. Since the goal is to find the number of hours he watched TV, he subtracted the minutes of each episode from the total minutes of all 2 episodes.  So for Wheel of Fortune - 2 hr + 80 min - 20 min = 2:00 \n8. Similarly, 2 hr + 190 min - 2 x 20 min = (2:00 + 2:00) - 2 x 40 min = 230 min -10 min = 220 min for Jeopardy.\n9. He now has the number of minutes he watched TV of each show.  He adds them up and divides the answer by 60 (60 min) to convert the hours into minutes. \n10.

I'm guessing it's some sort of electrical power-related problem-\n2. But I don't have enough information to be sure and to figure that out.\n3. I would have to understand if a power supply provides energy to a circuit or what it does in the circuit in order to determine what it could be used to solve. \n4. A power supply is the part of a circuit that provides electrical energy. \n5. It's made up of an electric transformer, a rectifier, and capacitors. \n6. The transformer transforms the alternating current from the mains to a direct current suitable for the purpose. \n7. The rectifier has two main functions. Some input power (direct current) is first used to generate an alternating current at a frequency compatible with the power factor required. \n8. Second, it provides a pure direct current at suitable voltage and frequency for other parts of the circuit.\n9. Finally, the capacitors stabilize, regulate, and control the voltage provided by the power supply. \n10. But we probably don't need all of that information. \n11. From here, we can reason that a power supply is primarily used to provide electrical energy and control voltage of a circuit. \n12. A power supply could help with a problem like supplying electricity and controlling voltage of a circuit that requires electrical power.\n13. This can help eliminate some guesses since it provides a more specific answer. \n14. For example, the power supply could be used in a computer circuit to", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": "1. The two gardener's planted tomato seeds in the morning. Mike planted 5 times while Ted planted 10 times more. Then, Mike planted more than Ted in the afternoon. Given this information, it can be assumed that Mike planted the majority of tomato seeds, though how many are planted together is still unknown.\n2. Note that the seeds were planted in 2 different days thus there's no correlation between the 2 numbers that Ted and Mike planted in the different days. It's not known whether Ted planted 2x as much in 1 day or 2x as much combined in 2 days. \n3. Since Mike planted fewer seeds in the 2nd day, it can be said that Ted planted only 50-60 seeds to total 110 tomato seeds.\n4. Alternatively, we can look at the 2 times more tomato seeds and say that since Mike planted fewer se\ns in the 2nd time, 90 seed was planted by Mike. This would mean that Ted planted the remaining 20 tomato seeds alone. Regardless of the method used, we know that Ted planted 2 less tomato seeds than what Mike planted.\n5.

{"text": "1st step: 1. The problem is how many gallons of water are needed to wash all the clothes. \n2. The question tells us that a load is washed in cycles.  We need to find the total number of loads, as that will give us the total number of cycles as well. \n3. To find the total number of cycles, we need to multiply together how many gallons the heavy, regular, and light wash all use per load, then add that number to the number of gallons used to wash two pounds as well as how many gallons were used in extra cycles due to bleach.  We need to multiply the resulting number together since we are looking for the number of cycles to get the answer. \n4. To solve the problem, we can see that for one load to be washed, you need 20 gallons for a heavy load, 10 gallon for a regular load, and 2 gallon for a light load, giving a total of 32 gallons per one load.  To have the number of cycles for all the loads equal to the number of loads we are told, we multiply this by the total number of lights, which is 2, giving a total of cycles. \n5. After counting the total cycles, we see there are a total of 255 gallons of water used in cycles.  We also see that the total number of loads is three, so we need to multiply this number by another to get the total number of loads.  To solve for the total number of loads we use the given information that two loads require bleach.  Because we multiply this twice, we add on extra cycles in the bleach cycle that gives us an extra total of 15. \n6. So, the total is 255 load times 3 cycles plus 15 that's 765 cycles, which equals 765 for the total number of cycles. \n7. Now we need to know the number of gallons needed for each cycle. \nSo, for the cycle with three gallons, we multiply the three gallons by the total number of cycles we have found, 765. \nThis gives us that 2,295 gallons are needed for the cycles where there are three gallons, which is for all of the heavy loads and half of the regular loads as well", "answer": " 76"}

Option A: \"didn't get a job that allows piercing\". We can exclude this because piercing and tattooing are not related to one another at all.\n3.

It's possible that Tina didn't have time to think of or remember getting a tattoo until she was of legal age (18).\n5. Option D: \"didn' have time\".

{"text": "1. The question is regarding collecting model cars and the number of each type Jim has.\n2. The first step is to determine the number of each type of model car that Jim has:\n3. \"4 x as many Buicks as Ford\" means that he has 4 Buicks for every Ford. This leaves 401 = (4 x 301-301) = 4 x 300 - 1.\n4. \"3 more than twice the # of Fords than Chevy\" is expressed mathematically as 3f > 2c. Substituting these variables allows us to solve for the number of cars:\n5. 3*300 > 2*301 - 301. 301 - 2 * 301 = 301 - (602 = 301). (602 - 301) = (301 - 601). 301 -602 = -601. -601 = (602 -301). 3 = 2c. 301 = (2c + 1).\n6. Plugging these values into a calculator to solve:\n7. 301= (2c + 2c + 1)/602 300 = (3c + 1)/301. 91 = c.\n8.

Here, Carlotta, who is an opera singer, makes a stage performance for a total of 6 minutes, with 3 minutes for additional practice after each minute she sings as well as 5 minutes for throwing tantrums before and after each minute she sang.\n3. In order to answer the question correctly, you'll need to have a solid understanding of the given information and be able to do simple math.\n4. Start by identifying the total number of minutes that Carlotta spends in the performance.\n5. First, since we know that she spends 1 minute on stage, we can deduce that she had a total of 6 performances or stages altogether.\n6. Next, multiply 6 by the number of additional minutes she spends practicing after each stage.\n7. In this case, it means that the total number of additional minutes she receives from practice is 3 * 6, or 18 minutes.\n8. Finally, we need to add the number of additional minutes from practicing to the number of tantrum minutes she spent before and after each stage.\n9. For this, we need to multiply the number of stages by the number of tantrum time she spent before and added up the total number of tantrum minute she experienced.\n10. In this scenario, she spent 5 additional tantrum minutes before each stage and also spent 5 minutes after each stage, which means her total tantrum minutes is 10.\n11. From here, the total combined time of Carlotta spending on stage, in additional practice, and also in tantrums would be (1 * 6) + (18) + (10), totaling to about 25 minutes and 5 seconds.\n12. To convert it to seconds, multiply 25 minutes and a second by 60, which would then bring your total to about 1525 seconds. To bring it down to minute and seconds, divide 1525 by 60.\n13. So, the final answer would be 25 minutes and about 43 seconds of total combined practice, temper tantrums and performance.\nSo the final question is A: 25 minutes and, about 43 seconds.", "answer": " 54"}

To calculate the amount of money needed to buy 8 new Books, substitute the value of 8 into 5th and divide both sides by 5 (the amount each book costs) and multiply the result by 13 (the amount he already has)\nB. There by the amount of money needed is : $88\nSo the final answer $88\n1. The question asks to calculate the sum of the 2 numbers, which are 58 and 38.\n2. To do this, we can first add them together, as follows:\n58 + 38 = 96\n3. Next, we are asked to divide both sides of the equation by 2, as shown below:\n96\u00f72=48\nSo the final answear is 2: 48\n1.

{"text": "1. The question is posed in the form of a mathematical equation: \"If the farmer has 2x pigs, 4x goats, and 56 animals total...\"\n2. The question stipulates that the farmer has \"2x pigs\" but not that he has \"twice as many pigs as\"... which means he could have 2pigs or 2,000 pigs (or more or less).\n3. We can further elaborate from the given information: the farmer has \"4x goats\" and \"56 animals total\", and we know \"10=x\" for the number of pigs at this time; \"1=y\" for the number of goats at this time; and \"56=t\" for the number of all the animals in this scenario.\n4. \"2x\" can be rewritten as \"2(10)=10*2\".\n5. Then we can deduce that he has 20 pigs and 4 goats (by plugging in the x value) and we can then further deduct that he would have 56 goats total (by plugging in y=10*2=20 and t=56)\n6. We can also rearrange these three relationships in an equation: 20=x/10 and 10=x/20 and 20=x, which means that x=10\n7. Then we can move forward and find that the number of goats is 560=x*y=560.\n\nThe overall answer is that we can simplify this question as \"x=10 and y=4 and x*y=56\" in which x=10 and y*x=560\nSo the final answer in the form of equation is 10=x y*x=500", "answer": " 11"}

{"text": "1.\n2. We can say that the first step in this question is to establish exactly what the Skipper is trying to achieve: to travel the route from Point A to Point B in as direct a line as possible. \n3. Then, we can look at each of the stated actions to determine their effect on the Skipper's progress toward his goal:\na) The Skipper begins the journey by traveling due east at a speed of 60 kilometres/hour. This means the Skipper takes 30 hours to travel from Point A to Point C.\nb) The Skipper then turns the ship's engines \"off\" to let them cool down, and the boat drifts backwards into Point C.\nc) After the storm, the wind \"blows the Skipper's vessel backward in a Westward direction\" and the ship drifts backward a distance of 22.5 km, from Point C to D.\n4. The Skipper is now at Point D and he can either continue with the same method of traveling due east at 30 kilometers/hour or turn eastward and travel toward the destination. \n5. The Skipper has a choice of two paths that could take him to the desired location \u2013 a path that includes turning back toward Point B, which is the destination; and a path that does not include turning back toward Point B. \n6. The skipper is trying to get from Point A to Point D as quickly as possible. If we consider the cost of traveling, the sailor faces a trade-off between distance and time travel. If he wants to travel as far toward the Point B, taking more time to do so means that the cost of traveling the distance will increase exponentially. \n7. Therefore, after the storm has blown the ship to Point D, the skipper takes a path toward the destination. He travels eastward for 30 hours \u2013 this would mean that he has traveled for 30 hours at a speed that is constant over the course of 30 hours. \n8.  The Skipper would now be at Point E. He will continue toward Point F, which would take him 30 more hours at a constant speed of 30 km/hr.\n9.

The other choices are more or less similar or do not make sense since the teacher has already provided them with plenty of the option.\n4. (B) The second option explains why the students didn't know what to do when trying to solve a problem.

{"text": "1) The question is asking about how much money Michael earned by selling his paintings.\n2) Solution: \n3) Approach: We need to first find the number of large paintings sold and small paintings sold.\n4) Since we do not know the number of painting sold Michael could have sold 5 to 20 large paintings and 10 to 60 small paintings.\n5) Therefore we will find both the largest and lowest possible number of large and small paintings and subtract the large from the small, to find the profit earned on the sale of one large painting.\n6) We can find the largest number by evaluating whether the lowest possible number of large paintings is lower than the lowest possible number of small paintings.\n7) We then find the smallest number by doing the opposite.\n8) Let's first find the minimum of the two numbers: 60\n9) Then, we find the maximum number of large paintings: 20\n10) From this, we can see that 20 is the smaller of the two, so let's find what that number is.\n11) The formula for this is: N2 + N = 5N - P (N = number of large paintings and P = price of large painting).\n12) We solve this for N: 5N - P = N2\n13) Let's use the smallest possible number for N: 60\n14) We then substitute all values into the formula: 300 \u2013 80 = 300\n15) Therefore, the largest possible number of large paintig sales is 300 paintings.\n16) Let's now find the minimum: 5N - 100 = 602\n17) We substitute the minimum value for N: 6\n18) 5(6) - 100\n19) We take 6% (1/16) of the left side of the equation to turn the answer into a whole number: 30/16 - 100/16 = 50\n20) 50 x 6 = 300 (large painting minimum)\n21) Next, we subtract the minimum number of sales from the maximum number of sales to find the minimum money earned.", "answer": " 1140"}

He does have the option of buying them at a 20% discount, but he is unsure about how many bottles he can get them for that price.\n2) Since we know that it holds 40 gallon, each bottle holds 1 quart and that the hot tub holds 4 gallons per gallons in each of those gallons, we can calculate the cost of champagne. If we fill the hot tub with champagnes, there are 40 gallons x 1 quarter of champagne in each gallon x the cost $50 x (140% of 1 quart) or a total of $5040.\n3) If we divide the cost of champagne with the volume of champagne, the cost of champagne per each is $5040/70 or $70.\n4) Since we have the answer and know that Jackson can buy at 20% discoun, we can figure out the total amount of champagne Jackson would get for $50, by multiplying 40 with 140%.\n5) The total amount of champagne he can get for $50 is 40 gallons(4), of liquid. If we take the gallons that he will get ($140), divided him by the total cost of champagne ($50), we get an answer that Jackson can get 17.4 bottles of champagne for $50.\n6) Therefore, the answer is 17.4.\nSo the final price will be 40G * 1Q * 50$ * 140% = 70$ per bottle that means total expenses will be 40 gallons * 1 quart * 50$/70=17.4 bottle*20% =5.68\nSo the final answer will be 5.68", "answer": " 6400"}

Then add up the remaining number of each fruit: she has 52 peaches, 50 oranges, and half of the number of apples = 50\n5. Since she has 52 (5+5+5+50/2=100), 50 (5+5+10)=60, and 100+20=80 fruits, she has 80+80+2+80+80, which equals 610, so her answer is 610\n6. It is important to notice that in the end, she only has 610 fruits because she gave her sister two of each item, leaving her with 60 more fruits, for a total of 610.\nSo the final calculation is [65(20)(110)]+[40(20)(10)+60] = 610\n\nInput: The bookstores in the new town were overwhelming, but I was able to what?

As there are 100 jellies in the bag, each child gets to take two jellies, and 80% of the children took the jellies from the bag, there are no more jellies left in the bag.\n2. The next step is to calculate how many jellies each child got. To do this, we need to multiply 80% by 2. As there are 40 children taking jellies from the bag in total, the answer is 32 children getting two jellies each, and 8 remaining jellies, which means that there are eight jellies left in the jar.\n3. We can write it down as follows: 80% (total children)*2 (number of jellies each child received) = 32*2 plus 8 or 64 + 8. In math notation, this can be written as 0.8(n)*2 + 1 = 32*1.8333 + 0.8. This means that the question is asking how many jellies are left after allowing half of the children to take two jelly beans each.

{"text": "1) To solve this question, we begin by breaking down the given information into more manageable parts, which will help us to work out the amount of time it would take a cheetah to catch up with a fleeing gazelle running at top speed.\n2) In the first part of this problem, we are given the speed of each animal, and the distance between them in miles as well as in feet when measured one mile per hour at a time. So, here is what we have so far:\n3) Distance (D) = 210 feet\n4) Speed of cheetah (SC) = 60 mph (miles per hour) = 60 f/s-1 (feet per second)\n5) Speed of gazelle (SG) = 40 mph (mph) = 40 f/s-l (feet per second-1)\n6) Given: d(che)=D-Sche, d(ga)=D-Sgaz, t(che)=60 min-1 (minutes per hour)\n\n7) We know the formula for distance using speed and time. t = SC x 60m/1min = 60 m/minSC = 1/60 min.  But t = SC x tmin = 60 x tminSC = 1 x tmin. (SC = 100 and tmin= 100) (distance = speed x time)   \ntmin = SC = 1    t = 1/6 minSC = 10 \nTherefore d = 1 mile = 1000 feet = 100 feet D = 1800 ft.\n8) We also have our time variable. tmin = tche = 1/6min = tche. tche is equal to the time it takes for cheetah to cover 1800 feet at 60 miles per hour.\n\n9) Time (t) = t(che) =2.75 min\n10) We also need to know the distance covered, which in this case would be 1800, because it was given in the question that the cheetah was running at full speed (60 miles per hour). The cheetah covers 800 feet (1/60", "answer": " 7"}

The base fine is increased from $50 to $375 by multiplying the base fine of $50 by 7 times.\n5: Additionally, the fine is doubled because Mark was in a school zone, making his fine $375 per mile. Therefore, his base fine is increased by an additional $750. This is done by doubling $375 (the original base fine) by 3 (the number of mile over the speed limit). \n6: However, Mark has to pay his lawyer's $80/hour fee for three hours (the amount of time needed to help Mark). So his lawyer's fine is $240.\n7: He must also pay fees, bringing his total fee to $880 plus the court costs of $300. \n8: Therefore, the final amount is $1095, which is the combination of the base fine of $750, the increased fine cost of $750 (doubling the base fine), the lawyer's fee of $240, and the court cost of $300\n\nInput: A 3' tall piece of furniture costs $70 plus $8 per inch.

The problem is to determine what a single sheet of paper is.\n2. To begin, let's look at the sentence: A single-sided piece is a sheet of paper that is only printed on one side.\n3. The key here is to understand the term \"single-sided\", it refers to the fact that the sheet of paper is only printed on one of its sides, so it is a sheet of paper with only one side printed on it.\n4. Another important concept to keep in mind is that of \"sides\" and \"sides\". A side is one side of the sheet of paper, while there are sides to the sides.\n5. This means that a sheet of paper with one single side is also a single sheet of paper.\n6. Thus, a single sheet of paper would be the sheet of paper with one side printed on it, which is a single-sides paper.\nSo the final explanation is a single sheet of what could be a single-sided paper, or a single-sided sheet of what could be paper.\n\nInput: Why are there fewer chickens than h", "answer": " 10"}

We need only to subtract the 45 seconds from the recommended time of 5 minutes.\n3. However, the question omits the specific time when the oven was finished, which would need to be subtracted from the recommended time to determine the exact time remaining.\n4. To solve the question, we can assume that the oven finished heating at the moment the fries were put into it (the oven would probably not turn on if it wasn't).\n5.

{"text": "1) The first step is to determine how much the injury is recovering daily. We know the injury took 3 days to recover from the first time he worked out which means 1/4 day (24 hours). Since James took 5 times that, we multiply 1/4 time by 5 to get 1 and 2/3 2/3 days (\u224849hrs). This makes sense considering 3 days is 72 hrs and we are subtracting 5\u00d772 which equals 360 and multiplying that by 2/3 which is 8/3 and that equals 540/3 which equals 180 which is \u2248360 so 540/2/3 which equals 2/4 and 2/3 which equals approximately 1 and 2 2/3rds. \nSo next we need to determine how much recovering James needs after the first day he starts working out again. If James was working out for 1.5 days (24 hrs) and it took 1 and 22/3 days to recover, then he would need to wait 1 and 25/3 days to recover to work out again. However James does not need to wait 1 year to start working out again because by the 3rd day he is \u2154 the way to being fully recovered. \nWe can put this in a formula and find 6/7 as the solution\nSo, the answer is: 6/7\nSo the final answer will be 6/7\n\nInput: You asked how to spell 'women'.

Three individuals, Sammy, Tammy, and Ron, are involved in the consumption of those numbers of pickles, and the problem asks for how many pickles Ron consumes. \n2. The first step in solving the problem would be to identify which numbers represent the pickles that Sammy, Tammy and Ron are consuming. This can be done by examining the equations below, which show how each individual is consuming pickles.\n3.  Sammy can eat 1 fifth of pickle slices or he can eat 15/5 slices; since the problem requires a pickle slice count, it would make sense to round the numbers and get an integer for the amount of pickle slices Tammy eats twice as much as Sam, or 2*(15/5), resulting in an integer of 30 pickle slices that Tammy (the sister of Sam) eats.\n4. However, if Tammy eats 30/5 slices or 6 pickles, in terms of pickles slices, Ron will eat 20 percent of that 6 slices, or 20/60 or 3/100, or 0.03.\n5. Subtracting 0.03 from 0.3, we will get 0.27 (or 27/100 in decimal form).\n6. Taking 0.3 away from it -1 (0.27), we get 0.32 (0.32=32/100).\n7.

{"text": "1. We are asked to calculate the number of cans that one machine can produce in 8 hours, given that it is capable of producing 30 cans every 30 minutes.\n2. We start by recognizing that the question asks for the number of cans produced in 8 hours, implying that we need to find a timespan of 8 hours in terms of the 30-minute intervals that the machine is capable of producing the cans.\n3. 30 cans are produced every 30 minutes and there are 30 minutes in an hour. Therefore, 1 can is produced every minute, or 4 cans in an hour.\n4. In 8 hours, there are 8(1/4) = 4 cans per hour or 8 cans per hour.\n5. In 80 minutes, there are 80(1/4) minutes which is the equivalent of 80(1) = 80 cans. \n6. In 8 hours or 480 minutes, there is 480(1) or 480 cans.\n7.

{"text": "1. The question is looking for the amount of money the trader made above her goal after soliciting donations.\n2. There is no mention of donors, so it can be assumed they all donated the same amount. Thus, the total amount donated is $310.\n3. The trader had a profit of $920 on a week of sales - the profit after subtracting cost from selling price. To pay for her next ship of $610 she splits the profit into two parts, one part she keeps for her own expenses, the other half $360 she is soliciting as donations.\n4. Thus, her profit is of $360. After she raises the $310 she needed to pay for her next stock, she is then left with $50, the amount left after paying for the stock was $280.\n5. Since we know that the profit of her stock sale was originally $920, her profit after adding the $50 to her stock is $970. Thus, a trader that made a profit after a week of sales of originally $920 by selling his goods managed to make $970 after her stock was sold, including raising funds for her next stock.\n6.

{"text": "The question involves Jean giving her grandchildren two cards and putting $80 in each, and the calculation of how much she gives away a year.\n1. The first thing to do is define how much the amount is every year. I'll keep them in symbols as follows\n1. C1=Jean's income, or total amount she has every year.\n2. C2=Jean's expenses, or the amount she spends per month.\n3. C3=Jean's total amount left for her grandchildren, or the amount that she gives them.\n\n2. Consider the first gift card of C3.\n    - C3=80.00\n    - C2=...\n    - C1=...\n\n3. Since C1 is assumed to be positive(i.e.Jean earns more incomes than she spends), C1 > C1, which also means C1 > C2 and C1 > C3.\n4. Substitute the initial givings in C2 with C3 and solve the recurring equality.\n    - C2 = C1 - C3\n5. When C3<0 (Jean no longer gives anything to her grandchildren), C2 would be positive because all the money is being spent for other purposes(C1=2*80-0).\n6. Therefore,\n    - When C2>0(the given situation), C2<C2\n    - C3 = 2*80-C2\n\n7. C2 = 2*8*80-C3\n8. The first thing to notice is that C3>0 because C2>0 (which means Jean has more money than before). This allows\n     - C3=2*8*8-2*8*8\n     - C3=-8*8\n     So the C3 is always positive while C2 is always positive.\n     So C2=8*8-C3\n9.

We can choose from A, B, C, D\n3. There are 3 things that define a car loan. We can eliminate C because there is no mention of high interest rate. D might indicate that you need to pay less amount of money, but nothing says it is low residual value. B sounds interesting but it has no down payment. So, it has to be A: low residual value because it is the only possible explanation.\n4. Since there are 4 choices and only one of it is possible, we can choose from A,B,C and D.\n5. It is not possible that a dealership offers an old car. It might have been in a bad accident recently and is being sold as the price is higher.

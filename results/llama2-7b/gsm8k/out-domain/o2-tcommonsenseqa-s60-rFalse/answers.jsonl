They each have holes at the bottom through which the blocks can be taken in and out, much like a chess rack.  An unlimited number of  blocks can be moved around each tower, but there is a catch:  only one block can be on any rod at any time. It must be legal to move any block to anywhere else on the rod.  (This includes rotating or swapping it with a block on an adjacent rod.)  Also, you have to follow the rules about one block per rod all the way around the towers, so the blocks can't get caught, or the game would instantly fail.  Each block must be in exactly the right position to continue the game.  \n\nYour task:  write a program that takes an input file and reads out the contents.

Then the teacher write down the equation x=114. The answewr is 114$.\n\nE: In this equation there is a equation which shows that x+2=3x. The answewr then is x=2. For the next two questions the answer is then just y=x.\n\nF: In this equation the answer is no because after the change of x to y, y=x+2 and x=x+2 so y=x becomes true which isn't true since y is x+2 but also x=x so you need both y=x and y=x to be true to show that x=y because then y=y and y=x+2 so in the end y=x but the teacher don't want you to do the math to show that they just want y=x.", "answer": " 200"}

The teacher wants to know this to be able to give the student a better idea of how cats work in a single home. \n\nThe cats eat the mouse. A cat can't eat itself so there must be one cat left. \n\n### answer :\n\nYou can't say anything without knowing the truth. But truth is elusive.

I did a research and found out the algorithm but the code is still complicated. I had to make this code in order to get high grade\n\n## Program Code:\n\n- `first_5()`\n  - this  `for(var i=50; i>=1; i-=1)` should be looped and when we get to `i` in 1, the `while (i<=50)` should have a code to stop.\n  - The program works right now but when i decrements it to `i-=1;` it doesnt seem to work.\n\n- `old_ladies_indoor_only_pet_cat_stay()`\n  - `else if (animal == \"cat\" ) ` is there a way how to determine if the animal is of that one? In other problem it was a cat and i thought it had a command for that\n\n- `rain_total()`\n  - So first it is going to set a counter for days = 15 then increase it by 15.\n  - I don't know if you see but after days = 15 we have a code with `else if`?  I wanted the program to ask how much is the rainfall but it was not doing that. I could say the amount of rainfall but how to make it say the days was 15?\n\n\n## Review:The program should display the instructions for the following grade math questions.\n### Answer:D:B:\n- `rain_days_and_rainfall_in_november()`\n  - Why not just go with the condition `if ( i> ==50 ) return true;`  and not the one with `if` with >=`true` or false.  I dont know but it seemed more efficient.\n\n### Answer:C:E:\n- `rainfall_total_in_november_town()`\n  - I liked this program more because of the code when the index equals 21 it should return true and vice-versa.

We thus take a 50% markup on our total sales - $500 in sales (for the month) * 50% markup = $250 profit per month from the vegetables.  Then the revenue to sales ratio on vegetable sales is $250 / $500 = 0.5. \n3. The markup of $250/ 500 is converted to $0.50 for each lettuce and $1.00 for each tomato, leading to the revenue per month per item ($0.5 per head of lettuce * 0.5 * 2 heads per customer * 500 customers) and ($1 per tomato * 0.5 head/customer * 500). \n4. Then the revenue for a month is $250.00 for 500 customers purchasing a $1.00 vegetable item plus the revenue from tomatoes of $1.00 * 500. \n5. $250.50 + $1.00 (500 customers * $1.00 item) = $251.50\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question\n\nQuestion: What are the total costs of the cat food store?\nAnswer: $100", "answer": " 2000"}

Did they just want you\n   to show your answer or did they want to see the method as well?\n\nAnswer: The first question is a simple question with multiple answers so they are saying they want both the answer and the process, in order to prove to them that you have the required knowledge.  Then for the second question, there is only one answer, so there is no reason for the teacher to explain this answer is the \"correct\" one (they assume you know this) as the other answers are not valid.  The only reason they're asking is in order to teach the method or explain why they're asking specific to the question.  The same kind of process applies to the third question; the teacher wants to see the required knowledge (answers) and the process (which part of the math shows that this solution is best suited for the situation?). This will also help the teacher understand the depth of knowledge you have, because they want you to explain why the answer is 16. <br>\n\n* Question 2: This question would ask you to show all your information so the teacher can check your work.

One of the exhibits asks for you to take a closer look at a group of frogs. \nThere is a 3-foot square display next to the group of frogs. As you look closer at the display, you find that the frog in the center wears an accessory with the shape of a bell around its neck. You think this is incredibly bizarre, so you ask one of the curators to explain this.\nHe tells you that this frog is known as an African dwarf crocodile. Although these crocodiles only grow to be 3 feet long, male crocodiles, like this frog, wear neckbands around their neck. These bands are actually made from a type of bird known as the white-throated bee-eater.\nYou then spot a large wooden box, which is placed near one of the frogs. You examine the box and are interested to find that it houses the same white-throated bird that apparently makes these neck-bands for crocodiles.\nYou have decided to do some research on these birds, and you wonder if there is a connection between the number of birds living in a particular area \nand the average temperature in that area. To help find the answer to your question, your friend suggests using an equation from statistics called the log-logistic equation.\nUse the log-logistic function to find the percent of white-throated birds that will be alive if the temperature is on average $53\\ ^{\\circ}F$. \nFind the temperature in $^{\\circ}F$ that the proportion of bird deaths is the highest.\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```", "answer": " 300"}

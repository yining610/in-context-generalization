I quickly stepped out of the way, feeling slightly aggreived as I'd had enough of bad driving the day before my bike had been dented by a delivery van and had to have a new bumper, and I'd been running at the gym for two hours and my new runners needed to dry out.  I was just hoping this idiot wasn't going to crash into me, but suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw another car rushing alongside the first car's driver's window, narrowly missing the car by inches before veering off into a ditch, smashing into a bush and a tree, and then tumbling to the ground.  Both passengers, the driver, and the other car were unconscious when the emergency services got there.  I waited with them, shaking my head as the fire fighters and ambulance crews attended to the scene.  I couldn't believe what I was now seeing.  And then I heard something, a low and continuous rumbling, emanating from both cars.  I turned my ears to the situation, to see what it was, and it dawned on me all of a sudden.  The cars were smoking!  I ran over to the accident.  A fire had started in the wrecked car just before the emergency services reached the accident site.  The driver in the wrecked crashed car was shouting \"Burn your damn car!\" as she attempted to escape!  I looked back quickly and saw the wreckage.  It was on fire, the driver now having walked away from the smash.  I turned round again and saw a man walking towards me, a bag of burning books in his hand.

For example, in a three-bedroom apartment, the city charges residents $500 to recycle $2000 worth of materials and they charge $250 to recycle $1000 worth of recyclable materials.

Because all of the cows can consume 2 lbs each in one day, we immediately know that we require at least 16 lbs to feed all of them. We also know that we have 8 cows, so, if we divide the total amount of food to create individual portions, we find that we have 2 lbs per cow per day.\n\nTo find the minimum number of corks, we need to add an additional portion of food. We begin with 8 cows, but add another portion for the ninth cow, which leaves us with 9. So, we require 8 + (1/19th) = 9 cows to feed 17 days.\n\nIf we divide the 17 cows 17:1, the result will be a lot of leftover cows; we need them to equal 1. Therefore, the minimum number of cats is 13 and the answer is 13.\n\nInput: If someone is going to the park, where might they walk if they are leaving a nearby hotel and going to the park?

Choices: A: add all the gram and substract 5000 B: find the average and square each number and substract 5 C: add 1000 to the 5000 and square the sum of the whole sum D: If you buy fries that weigh 400 grams, they usually have between 3 and 4 calories per g. For this question let's say fries with 3.5 calories per gram. (this is an estimate based on the weight, you have to do some actual math if you want to get more exact.) So the average calorie per gram would be the total calories divided by the average weight of fries in grams. Average weight of fries: 400 calories/g * 4(g) = 1600 calories for an average pack of fries. So 1600/3.5(calories in gram)=450 calories for 100g of fries. And to get the number of calories for a pack of 600grams of fries, you just multiply 450by 6 which gives you the answer of 2700 calories. E: Calculate for 1 gram, use square roots to estimate how many grams must be 5000, square root 5000 to get 224.63 so the total number of grams is 225 grams which equals to 247.5 calories.\n\nInput: I could remember the formula P = PT to divide a rectangular space in half by cutting a line from point A to point B.

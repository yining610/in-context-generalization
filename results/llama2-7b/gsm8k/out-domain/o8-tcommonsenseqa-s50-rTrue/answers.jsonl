To answer this, first, we eliminate the choices that are not related to learning to play a musical instrument: choice i: from an instructors ii: by playing along other players iii: in a group iv: by listening vi: at home \n3. Choice v: \"by going to a musical store\" is also not related so we can eliminate it too. \n4. Next, we consider choice vi, which is related. It is an instruction to the students - \"learn in class, with other players\". So, we can eliminate it.  \n5. Eliminating i: \"class, with other musicians\", iii: \"playing along with other players\", and vi: \"learn in class,  with other musicians\". Choice ii: \"learning from another player\" is also not relevant so we can eliminate it as well. \n6. From the remaining candidates; choice ii: \"learning from an instructor\". Learning from an instructor is clearly a necessary part of the process of learning to follow directions in music. So, choosing choice ii: \"learning to follow directions from an instructor\" is our answer. So our final answer is ii: \"learning from the instructor\".\nSo the final answer ii: learning from the instructor\n\nInput: What is the main idea of the passage \"Japan", "answer": " 16"}

It'll end at 10 AM on the 12th day of every month.\n3. Hence, based on the above facts, the question asks when do You and your friend have to be ready before leaving.\n4. The shift ends at 10 AM, so we can eliminate option A: midnight and E: 10 PM.\n5. Now we can eliminate other options based on the given information on time shifts and the friend.\n6. Friend leaves at 4 AM, so he cannot leave at 2 AM.\n7. Friend leaves at 6 AM so he can leave at 6 AM.\n8. You leave at 2 AM, so you'll leave at 2 AM when your friend enters at 4am.\n9. We need to subtract the time of your friend who starts at 4 AM. So if 4 = 8, 4 + 8 = 12 AM. You both leave at 2 AM = 12 AM + 2 AM + 4 AM = 4 AM + 8 AM + 12 AM = 26 AM. 26 AM - 12 AM =14 AM.\n10.

Option A: (the) shoreline does not mention the land that joins the two pieces of land.\n2. Option B: (the) peninsula, like option A refers to the land that joins the small pieces of land. It also only refers to one area and not two. Hence, option B: (the) Peninsula is also eliminated.\n3. We are only left with options C: strait, which suggests an open body of water that may connect to a large body of water, but does not necessarily have two islands, and D: isthmus that connects two smaller land masses.\n4. Since the given choice does not fit into either of these scenarios, only option D: isthmus is remaining.\n5. If \"a\" and \"b\" in this question represents two small pieces of land then in a way it is a 'toll bridge'. There is no 'toll bridge' listed as an option.

Choices: 1: easy 2: moderate 3: difficult 4: very difficult 5: impossible\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about the difficulty of cleaning the entire home. We interpret the entire home to represent the entire space that a person is responsible for keeping clean, including the rooms, windows, floors, etc.\n2) There are two ways to approach this problem: we can choose the hardest difficulty level, or we can choose the easiest difficulty level and then increment. If we take the first approach, then 3 is the easiest, 5 the hardest. If we take the second approach, then 1 is the easiest, 2 is next, 3 is the next hardest, and 5 is the hardest.\n3) By looking at the choices, we find that option 5 appears too difficult. It is impossible to clean the entire house by hand, therefore this answer must be rejected.\n4) The remaining choices are each one difficulty level apart.\n5) If we increment, we first multiply the current difficulty by 10, then add 1, then multiply by 10 again. If we subtract, we first multiply the number by 10, add 1, then divide by 10. With this approach, we can find the answer by subtracting the smallest difficulty from the hardest difficulty.

He was only 25 years old then, which means he was 29 years old in 1897, which in turn means the question being asked is about 1983, not 1883.\n2) It is safe to assume that this question is referring to 'points per game' (i.e. points scored per basketball game) rather than 'lifetime points' (i.e the total points a player scored during the entirety of his career). This is because the question refers to \u201ca season\u201d, not \"a lifetime\".\n3) The question asks for \"how many points\" Michael Jordan \u201cscored\u201d in 1997.

Hence, the answer options B, C and E are ruled out.\n5: Of the left over options D and A, A is ruled out because summer is a longer period than one day and cannot be the time when she/he worked on a project of her/his choice.\n6: Hence, the correct answer for the question is D when I worked on a project.\nSo the final choice is D: it was my (our) choice, which is of the shortest duration and most appropriate choice to be answered.\n\nInput: What item, when placed under a tree, will attract the least amount of attention?

Hence cannot be the item under the tree whose attention can be attracted the least.\n5) The choice C. a bear cannot be the correct choice either because the bears live at mountainside, in forest, prairie, or t", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "hand, is a common place to find such types of businesses, so  we eliminate option D: strip mall.\n7. After considering all the choices, we can come to conclusion that Option D: strip mall contains the answer to this question.\n8. A strip mall is a shopping area consisting of various small stores, food establishments, and businesses located in a row along in one street. This could work as a plausible scenario for placing a dental office, candy store, and fast food place right next to each other.\nSo the final solution is D: strip mall", "answer": " 64"}
{"text": "hand, is a place typically housing small businesses. It often involves shops selling specific items like food, clothing, etc. So, this narrows down the answers to options D: strip mall and E: Urban area.\n7. From our previous analysis, urban area could not be the answer, but if it were, \"strip mall\" would have to be incorrect because it is a subset of urban areas.\n8. After ruling out urban areas, there is no other option but D: strip mall.\nSo the final correct answer here is D: strip mall\n\nInput: If all people thought alike, how long would it take to get the world\u2019s opinion to change? Choices:  This is false Choices:  A) one day B) one week C) one month D) one year E) one generation.\nOutput: 1 - The question is asking about the time it would take to get the world's opinion to change if all people thought alike.\n2. This statement assumes that everyone thinks alike, but this is not the case in the real world. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered to be true. It's also worth remembering that when something is true, the opposite statement (in this case \"not true\") must be false. But if the given statement is false, both statements are false.\n3. All options involving the term \"true\", except for D, are implying \"not true\". This is because if something is true then it implies that something that is false cannot be true.\n4. Option D is the only given statement that does not use the term \"true\", which implies that it must be false.\n5. This narrows the possible answers to either D (if it's false) or else all the other options (if the main statement is false).\n6. Since only option D is a statement of truth, it must therefore by excluded as being true and so it's only the remaining choices that remain as the possible answers.\n7. From this narrowing, we know that none of the other statements (A) through (E) are true.\nSo the final conclusion is that Option D is the truth and all the rest must be false. Therefore, the final answer to this question is D: This is false.\n\nInput: What is a good thing about the number three? Choices:  The first answer  A", "answer": " 3"}

Therefore, the answer to the question is C: strip mall.\nSo the final answers are options C: strip mall\n\nInput: What is an example of an outdoor amphitheater? Choices: \nA: movie theater B: concert hall C: stadium D: amphitheater E: garden\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about what is an outdoor amphiteatre.\n2) An amphiteatre is typically a stage for entertainment purposes.\n3) It can feature actors, singers, musicians, and others.\n4) It is usually outside. Therefore, a garden would not be considered an amphiteatre. Answer D: amphiteatre\n5) A garden is typically an indoor / outdoor space for leisure or meditation and can be found in houses or towns.\n6) A garden is not made for entertainment purposes, so it would not be considered as an example of an outdoors amphitheater.\n7) Hence, the answer to this is C: outdoor amphitetheatre.\nSo the final is D: amphiteater\n\nInput: How often do you have to work to get to the rank of corporal?

There is a lot to choose from.\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about what can you say about a particular city that has the two top ratings among the top ten most desirable cities.\n2. This indicates that the city must have many features that people are looking for in a desirable city and that it should be seen as one of the top choices on everyone\u2019s list.\n3. Option: a. It has many a high rating. is incorrect because it is not a complete sentence.\n4. Option: b. It should be able to make any list of places to live means that you can\u2019t make conclusions about a single city based on two ratings. Additionally, there is no specific list to compare the city being rated to, so this option does not fit and is not the answer\n5. Option: c. Its citizens are educated and educated does not necessarily imply desirable, so this option is not the answer. \n6. Option: d. It is a desired city to live in means that a single city must always be at the top of any list. This is not accurate and is not the answer. Therefore, d. It is a desirable city to live in is incorrect. \n7. Option: e. There is much to choose from. is too vague to interpret and does not fit the context of the question. Therefore, e. There is a whole lot to choose from is incorrect. \n8. Hence, only option B: that is should be on anyone's list of places to be desirable fits", "answer": " 97"}

C: England D: Africa E: China\nOutput: 1: The question states \"Where is Bora Bora?\" so the correct answer should mention an actual location of the word Bora Bora.\n2. Bora Bora, New York City and United States are all located in the same country. Hence, option B: United States is incorrect.\n3. Bora Bora is located in a territory of Polynesia and the only real country in the region is France, so the answer is C: England.\n4. Bora Bora and Bora Bora are both places in Polynesia but belong to different countries and different cities, so Bora Bora is incorrectly placed here.\n5.

(Answer) E: Morgan\u2019s wife didn\u2019t want him to work the late night shift.\nOutput: 1.'Morgan didn\u2019t  want to work late at nigh'\n2.The question asks us what happened to the 8 pm to 4 a.m. shift at the pizza store.\n3.The following story describes this shift.\n4.The next thing that happened to the late night shift has to be either Option B or Choice E. \n5. 'Morgan was asked to move to a day shift instead' doesn't make sense because this would imply that they have asked him to do it as a permanent change. Morgan just mentioned that he was asked about moving the shift which can't be permanent. Also, Morgan didn't  want to work the shift that much, so Morgan wouldn't accept that shift even if he was asked about it. \n6. Option C doesn't make sense as Morgan did not agree to change the work shift and he is not asked to change his work shift. Rather Option C doesn't give the correct answer as Morgan doesn't accept the shift in the story. \n7. That means the correct answer would be that Morgan's husband's wife didn't want to work the late night in the restaurant. \n8. That's why the answer to this question (The question is asking what happened to the 4 am to 8 pm late night shift at the pizza) is E: Morgan\u2019s  wife didn\u2019t want to  work the late night shift in the restaurant.\nSo the final result", "answer": " 55"}

This rule out options B, since the daughters were born months apart.\n3. It isn\u2019t surprising that he would not have three girls born in a month, which is why O is not a correct answer.\n4.

So the answer should not be 'C: find a restraunt'.\n4. In the question, the context suggests the travellers did not stay in their hotel. So the answer should include option 'a: drive down the road' or 'b: go to bed'.\n5. Among the remaining options, the context does not specify their travels. So option 'd: have a swim', and option 'e: have a shower', do not fit the context of 'the traveling couple'.\n6.

The meaning of 'inspire' is also about 'helping'.\n3. Option A and C contain the meaning of 'helping'. They have to do with 'understanding' and 'inspire'. So, both options A and C are correct.\n4. Option D, 'none', doesn't convey the desired meaning. So, option D is incorrect.\n5. Now we can compare options A and C.\n6. Option A is the best choice because'respect' is more specific than 'understanding' and has a deeper meaning.

This seems like the most feasible scenario since a dental office (specifically orthodontic services) is indeed located within a group of medical buildings.

I'll protect you.\nOutput: 1) We do not need to know the specific details of the cat attack. We can assume the cat attack happened at night, thus, the alley.\n2) This question asks if a 'person' would or should say something under certain circumstances. \"Would\" can indicate that the outcome of the scenario is likely to happen, or it could suggest that it has already happened. We must use \"would\" to rule out the first option and then use \"should\" to determine the'should' part of the question.\n\n3) The word \"why\" is not applicable here as the attack didn't occur due to the person going down an alley in the evening (or the attack was for no reason at all). The words \"because\" and \"because of\" are used in this scenario and mean that a reason is required. This indicates we should be looking for a reason to go down an alley, not the reason someone got attacked. \n\n4) It is unlikely that the option \"see a doctor\" would be relevant under the circumstances. It's not logical and illogical means it shouldn't be chosen. If it were selected, it would mean that a person would go to the doctor just because they went down an alley at night.\n\n4) It appears that option", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "hand, is usually a small-scale outdoor commercial strip with many small businesses, which means it is more feasible for a dental office, candy store, and quick service restaurant or food franchise to coexist next to each other than a hospital or an urban area. \n7. But it's also important to note that even though strip malls allow a wide variety of shops to be on one side of a street, there may still be restrictions on what businesses can coexist directly next to each other. \n8. So, a business that deals with health-related care needs to have a specific distance (usually 100 feet) from a business that sells food or candy to prevent cross-contamination concerns. In this case, it appears highly unlikely that a dental office would be able to reside directly next to a candy/confectionery store.\n9. This is confirmed in the paragraph which reads: \"it seemed weird to have a Dental Office located next to a Candy Store and a Fast Food location. Therefore, the correct answer is B. A hospital, which is too restrictive in terms of what types of shops it will allow next to it, and an urban area, which is too vast and general to encompass the specific location needed to meet the criteria of this question, are not viable answers. \n10. A strip mall too allows for many different shops and other establishments, but there are certain limitations and regulations that must be followed to preserve health standards. For example, certain businesses cannot operate right next to each other to prevent cross-contaminants. This is why the answer to this question cannot be a strip mall.

We analyze the provided meaning of march and eliminate choices B and C, because they are not suitable for march in any way.\n3. Choice B: \"run very fast and for very-long distances\" is not suitable for \"march\" as it does not involve walking along.\n4: Choice C: \"go out of the way\" is not suitable as well, since it involves two different actions in one word.\n5: Next, we need to find the word that describes \"make or cause to be made\" or \"very large amounts\". Choice A: \"run very fast\" is very similar to B, but in our sentence, we are asked to \"not do\" the activity, so A doesn't match the meaning.\n6: Choice E: \"make or cause to made\" seems like a candidate but is repeated in the question and is not required, so it is eliminated.\n7.

C: The attackers knew more about the location and terrain.  D: There were fewer defenders to the rear. E: The rebels were not as afraid of death as the enemy.\nOutput: 1) Each choice is analyzed and its fitness for the answer is considered by taking into consideration the following:\n2) Choice A: Having more men is a strength for the rebels but this does not give information as to what specific advantage this gives the rebels during the final battle.\n3) Choice B: This description is too vague to say the fronts that were attacked were both the same and it is not sure to what degree these attacks were on either end. Thus, the answer choice is ruled out.\n\n4) Choice C: \"More enemies on either flank\" is good information but the choice doesn't highlight how that would make the battle advantageous to the rebelles.

What do they use that is in the air?\n3). Now, we proceed to analyzing each choice.\n4). B: fuel and oil - This is an incorrect answer because fuel and oil are physical substances, not a concept of 'air'.\n5). C: air - Air is definitely one of the things in the air, so this is an incorrect answer.\n6). E: tires - This refers to the physical material that forms part of a tire, which is not an 'air' in general.\n7). F: air - This is a reiteration of option C: Air.\n8).

Choices:  A. overpopulation B. not enough sleep C. global warming D. loneliness E. pollution\nOutput: 1). The question requires understanding of which modern problem is most discussed, especially in the media. We start by analyzing the option.\n2. The question mentions \"the most common problem of the world\". This excludes \"problems\", which suggests that the problem is singular rather than plural.\n3. We can eliminate choice A: overpopulation because \"of the world\" is plural.\n4. We can also eliminate choice B: not enough sleep because \"of the world \" is plural, in other words, there's only one world.\n5. Therefore, we can eliminate the \"problem of the world\" is plurality and only remain with A/ B/ C/ D/ E.\n6. Choices A and B are too specific. This reduces the choices further. Hence, we start by eliminating A: overpopulation and B: not enough sleep.\n7. Choices C: Global warming and D: Loneliness seem too broad and too general. They don't address specific problems of the modern world.\n8. Therefore, we can reject choice C: Global warming. (Global warming may not qualify as a common problem of the modern, developed world, according to some people)\n9. We can also reject choice D: Loneliness since it doesn't address a problem of the world. Loneliness can affect individuals, but alone-ness isn't an issue of the world, but of the individual.\n10.

Choices: 1. Slowly, then suddenly. 2. Very slowly. 3. Lies on its belly and crawls. 4. Moves in bursts followed by pauses. 5. Sticks its tongue out then runs off. 6. Moves slowly then abruptly.\nOutput: 1) First, the question requires that we consider what a garter snake normally does, rather than what it does when threatened. Therefore,'suddenly' or'suddenly attacking' are both incorrect options.\n2), 4) and 5) are not typical behaviours of a garter snake, therefore they are ruled out.\n3), 6) and 7) are the only behaviours/actions of a garter snakethat are similar to what a garter sne may do during attacks, so it's plausible that they may be correct.\n7) sounds less likely, however, since'moving slowly then abruptly' in attack context is quite unnatural. A better way of conveying this action would be 'crawls to attack, and then runs away'. And indeed, we do not find that anywhere.\nThe answer, therefore, is 3) - lies on its belly and moves slowly.\n\nInput: When did the Eiffel Tower open? Choices: 2.

A life cycle is the set of developmental stages from birth or sprout to death or withering of a plant. \n2. The student should have already learned about the cycle of plant life. It should describe how plants go through the stages of life and die and get replaced by new plants through the process of sexual reproduction. This suggests that a flower cannot be confused with a plant itself and its offspring.\n3. Plants can grow from seeds and seeds can grow from seedlings like leaves and stems. After a few generations of seedlings, new seeds can be produced through sexual reproduction, and a cycle can begin again. After some time, the cycle can end with the plant's death. \n4.

Choices:  D: high school E: hospital F: gymnasium G: community center H: church I: church and community center J: community center and high school K: church and high school\nOutput: 1) In this context, \"building\" refers to an indoor space to be occupied. \"Room\" in that context can be understood as an empty \"space\" (hence not a hall, kitchen, closet, etc). Also, \"community center\" in this context refers to an institution providing activities and services to people living in the surrounding area, such as classes, exercise programs, arts and crafts, daytrip excursions, etc.\n2) The church and community centers are the only centers with shared walls.

Choices:  B: writing C: investing D: posting on the forum E: inventing\nOutput: 1: By 'the what did the person who invent', it is clear that the context is talking about a person who is well-known for inventing something -- an option we need to work with is the 'Internet'.\n2. Thus, the question is asking 'What did the person who invent the Internet regret doing in past?'.\n3. We can rule out choices B: writing and C: investing as the'regret' is in the past, and the Internet is a relatively new thing, so these are too recent to be a regret from past.\n4. We can further eliminate choice E: inventing as a possibility as the inventor, whoever they might be, might not regret anything they invented as the invention might have benefitted the person.\n5. Now, the 'person who invents the internet' is likely to be a computer scientist, and it is very rare for them to not interact with the internet in some way that would be a concern, so there is no clear regret point for this. \n6. Furthermore, the regret is in the past but the user is still alive and would not likely have any regrets in the present, but they could have in the past while they were still alive.\n7. So to determine the correct answer, we first discard choices D and E, because the person is still alive, and they do not invent or post on forums anymore.\n8. Then, it is likely that the regret is about something that went wrong or not as well as they thought the first time they used the internet, so option A: writing is a good contender, but it still does not directly answer the question since writing something also means it was read, published, or distributed and doesn't have to be written by the person who invented it.\n9. What does make sense in this context -- we can write on the internet or post on forums, but we don't have to invent the internet.\n10.", "answer": " 7"}

But fish won't die if the fish are in saltwater. In the question, they mention that they tried it, but they couldn't get rid of the smell. So saltwater is the wrong choice.\n3) Freezing: It is a good way to get rid of fish's smell (in the same way, we use it to keep vegetables for longer). But frozen fish may not be fresh. Moreover, it is too cold for fresh fish.  This is why it is a wrong choice.\n4) Coldwater: This is correct. It is the fish's body temperature. We normally use it for transportation.\n5) Freshwater: This is also correct. We put it into a tank or a bowl. The temperature inside a tank and a bowl is normally close to the normal fish's temperature, so that will not bring a big drop of fish's body temperature down. So it is also a wrong choice.\n6) The rest", "answer": " 11"}

One: not important B. Two: of interest C. Three: irrelevant or irrelevant D. For 4 and five: relevant E. For 4 and 5: of interest\nOutput: 1..Start by considering the four categories that are mentioned: \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", and \"four and five\".\n2. First category: \"one\" - The category of number \"one\" is given a definition: \"not important\". Since the number \"one\" is associated with \"not important\", this category (category 1) can be ruled out.\n3. Second category: \"two\" - This category is said to be \"of interest\", which would seem to fit this given description. After all, the category two is associated with something \"of interest\". However, it must be remembered that the category does not represent all instances of the number two. Rather, it only represents instances that are \"of interest\". Therefore, only selected numbers within the category 2 can be considered. For example, let's look at the number 20, which is obviously not considered to be \"of interest\". Therefore this number should not be counted when considering the category 2. It is only those numbers that are \"of interest\" that should be considered within this particular category. So, category 2 consists of a sub-category within itself, that is, the category of \"all numbers that are important or considered to be of interest\". This would be represented by the number two, and other relevant numbers would include four, five and possibly twenty-three.\n4. Third category: \"three\" - the category three has the definition of \"irrelevant or irrelevant\". The given definition states that the category is of two possibilities: either it is \"irrelevant\" or it is \"irrelevante\". Since both possibilities represent the definition, category three consists of both the possibilities. The first possibility is \"irrelevant\", in which case any numbers that are irrelevant or \"not", "answer": " 23"}

Looking at someone's physical appearance may provide some insight into what kind of person they might be, but it doesn' t necessarily mean that they will be a compatible friend.\n4.

The correct answer requires finding a word that never seems to be mentioned in the context which is used to form a compound sentence.\n2. Consideration will be made for options that begin with a capital and end with a plural noun. If the correct answer is A: parents with teens, the sentence will read: \"Why do you never hear about parents with teens getting along?\"\n3. The next capital letter should be in the middle, and therefore, the last letter of the compound sentence needs to be a consonant. Thus, one out of the capital letters A, B, or C could be \"employees and their bosses.\" If that is the answer, the sentence should read: \"Why do we never hear about employees and their boss getting along?\"\n4. If the reader feels like they would continue the sentence with the option C: employees and their ____, the wrong word should be chosen. The letter should be in the ending, and the word should not be capitalized. \"Why do we never seem to hear about employees and their ____ getting along?\" is the right sentence.\n5. Options D and E cannot be the answer because they cannot be used in the middle position, and the correct answer needs to be mentioned in the compound sentence.\n6. If the reader is unsure after elimination, they can check the answer with option A: which is a word they never hear in conjunction. So, the final answer", "answer": " 1500"}

Choices:  D: too small A: too low B: too hot C: to close to the burner D: too wet E: too wide\nOutput: 1: The question is asking why it is not okay to use the toaster on the counter. This means that using it on the counter is not the intended placement, and the question is asking for the reason. \n2. To answer this, it is necessary to think about what would be the reason that it would be acceptable to use it on the counter, or what would be the reason it would not be acceptable to use it there.\n3. The first reason that would be deemed acceptable is that the toaster has a handle, hence it is too difficult to push down with your palms. This can be ruled out because the toaster does not have a handle for this purpose. \n4. Next, the toaster could be too large to use on the counter, which would be inconvenient. However, the toaster is not really large, so this cannot be the reason.\n5. The next possible reason is that the toaster could have something on it, which would make pushing it with your palms difficult. So, we can rule out this possibility as well because there is nothing on it. \n6. Thus, we are left with B: too hot, and D: too wet. The reason being that it is hot and potentially could scald the palms of anyone trying to push it down firmly. \n7.

But this choice is not just editing/revising/etc., it's much broader and a word that is used for revising the plot, the characters, and even the grammar. In other words, the word \"revise\" does not simply refer to an edit.\n6. Therefore, we know that this is not the answer. \n7. Option C says we can \"alter\" a manuscript.  The word \"alter\" on its own can mean many things. For example, it can mean to change the author's original intention, or intentionally change a theme in the manuscript.\n8", "answer": " 1150"}

Choices:  A : E B : S C : I D : L E : N F: T G: S H: U I: Y \nOutput: 1: The question is asking how to spell, \"abbreviation\", that is, it needs to know if the word \"abbreviation\" is an abbreviation itself or not. \n2. We also observe that the choices given are letters.\n3. If the correct answer is A, then it doesn't make sense to spell it (as the word itself is the answer) and since it is not an abbreviation, (the \"abbreviation\" itself), it cannot be spelled as an abbreviation of itself which will be an incorrect spelling of it.\n4. So the correct choice will be not A.\n5. If the correct answer was E, then since English letters are not an abbreviation of English letters and thus does not make sense to spell it using English letters, it can't be chosen as the correct option.\n6. So we can eliminate E.\n7. If the correct answer were F then again, since it is not an English letter, it wouldn't make sense to abbreviate it using English letters, (English letters are not an abbreviated form of English letters.) and it cannot be spelled using English letters, we can eliminate the choice F.\n8. After all that, if the correct answer were I, it makes sense to spell \"abbreviation\" on the lines of \"I\". \n9. This makes the correct spelling \"IY\".\n10. So the final answer is IY.\nSo the final answers are: IY\n\nInput: If it was inevitable for someone to get wet, how would this person dress?

We need to understand the term 'public'.\n4. In the choice [A: awareness] it refers to people who live and work near the path, meaning people who bike and bike paths need to keep in mind the needs of people who bike\n5. In the choice [B: funding] it refers to people with financial investments. It is important for them to invest in a proper traffic plan.\n6. In the choice [C: traffic] it refers to cars on the path, i.e. people who drive cars. It is important that cars can move smoothly so that the path can be used by more cyclists.\n7. In the choice [D: promotion] it refers to cycling teams who compete in bicycle races.\n8. In the choice [E: education] it refers to school children who may bike to school.\n9.

Choices: 1. A: running B: crunches C: yoga D: skipping E: squats\nOutput: 1-1. The question is referring to a type of exercise that is supposed to aid in reducing acid reflux.\n2-2. The answer depends on whether the exercise has a positive or negative influence on acid reflux symptoms. A negative influence would imply that the exercise will worsen the symptoms.\n3-3. Crunches and yoga are stretching exercises which have little bearing on acid reflux in either case, so they cannot be the correct answer here.\n4-4. Since skipping is a very intense exercise, it may produce a negative effect on acid reflux by aggravating symptoms.

In the absence of any other context, the correct answer must be A: rainforests: which are the typical type of location where owls are most likely found since they have plenty of trees and open space for the creatures to thrive in and hunt food in.\n2) Now, we have to determine what other option is a suitable choice beside A and what other options are to be disqualified:\n3) We know that the word 'rainforest' refers to a geographic location.

Therefore, this condition affects 1:200. By dividing by 89 we get an answer of 1 in 1,011. This is an increase of 16.5% over the original rate of 1 in 875.\n  The reason for the increase was given by the question itself that \"it is inherited and the parent is not affected unless both parents are carriers\". Therefore, parents of an affected child have a greater chance of being carriers than the average population.\n  We know from the above that \"being carriers\" means that they are 1 in 2. This means that every other couple has a 50% chance of having an affected child, a 50% increase of having a affected child over the original rate of every 1 in 8,750 cases.\n  This means that out of every 750 cases, there would be 467 affected people and also 433 carriers. 336 unaffected people and 399 affected people would make a total of 735 people affected with an affected rate of 336/750. This means that 46% of those born with the condition get a chance of being affected.\n  The above answer was arrived at using mathematical methods of division, percentages, and other simple processes that could easily be understood by individuals with grade-school", "answer": " 5"}

Choices: A: apple B: carrot C: potato D: cheese E: all of the above\nOutput: 1) We start by analyzing each of the options\n2) Item B is a carrot which is a root vegetable. Hence it cannot contain animal (or human) protein. So item B can be easily eliminated.\n3) Item C (potato) is a starchy root vegetable and may contain some small amounts of protein and carbohydrates. But Item C is not made up of animal (or human) proteins.\n4) Item D is a type of food containing animal protein. So item D contains protein and can stay in the list.\n5) If all of the above contain protein then it is very unlikely for us to observe protein-only food items. So the above option can be eliminated.\n6. Hence only choice A (apple) and choice B (cheese) can be said to contain protein so item A and item B can be kept.\n7. Next, We see that both A and B contain protein. So either A or B can be our answer. Item D provides animal protein. Hence, both these items can't be said to contain protein. The above information gives us a dilemma of which answer to choose among A, B, and D.\n8. To solve this, we can look at our requirements and analyze if the question asks for food items or not. We can say the question is asking for food items (food or not) and asks for an item where protein is required.\n9.

Choices:  a. stupid. b. smart. c. beautiful d. fat\nOutput: 1) Start by ruling out options that are not insults. Options b, c and d are not insults, and option a is an adjective and not an insult, so ignore these.\n2) Now for the options that remain, we know that calling someone 'fat' is an insult. But calling someone 'Fifi' is not an insult.\n3) Next consider what a nick name like 'Fifi' could be saying about someone. The only things that come to mind when a person is short-tempered are that they are rude or stupid. There is no other meaning that comes to mind.\n4) Now take a close look at the options. Option A, while it may sound like an insult, it is not. Stupid is a description of someone and not an insult. And Option B is not an insult either. Smart is not an insult, and there is no meaning for 'beautiful' that can make it an insult. \n5) The only option that fits the bill is option C, which means calling you 'Fifi' is calling you short-tempered because of your short attention span.\nSo the final solution is option C: short tempered. This is because, the person calling you 'Fifi', is calling you short tempered.\n\nInput: A group of engineers, physicists, psychologists, and sociologists are called what?

A: conduct a survey B: send out a questionnaire C: have meetings D: observe E: make visits\nOutput: 1) The question in this question seeks to determine what a new teacher at a middle will typically do to get a sense of the student body and their needs.\n2) This indicates she does not have much prior knowledge about students, and she also has multiple ways of finding about students.\n3) A new teacher would likely conduct a survey or distribute a questionnaire to get a sense of student demographics and preferences. This is typically done as part of an introductory process to get to know the student body and their preferences. It's not just one single action as it can be completed over time and also be followed up.\n4) Options B: send out aquestionnaire, C: have meetings and D: observe are not single actions and could be used to conduct a survey or to distribute a questionnaire in the subsequent days and weeks.\n5) Therefore, the choice that best matches the requirements in the question and is the most likely action that a teacher would take is the one that is a single action but the best fit for the requirement, which is choice E: make visits. \n6) The new teacher can make visits to the students in the classrooms or during some other time when they are present to further understand their preferences, needs, and characteristics through face-to-face interaction. This serves as a useful tool to become familiar with the student body and helps build rapport with them.

Option A/ans: one eye, is the most relevant to this topic, and does not indicate or show an alien with more than one eye. Hence, it is an incorrect answer choice.\n3. Option B/ans: green, can suggest the outer appearance of the alien, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily denote the alien race. Moreover, humans are one race, which is not applicable in the context of this scenario.\n4. Option C/ans: human--like, is incorrect as all beings in our universe are unique, making this comparison incorrect and confusing.\n5. Option D/ans: non---human, is also incorrect since humans are a subset of humans and non-humans is an incorrect way of putting it.\n6.

What else might the boy have been doing? Choices: 1. reading a book 2. watching television 3. doing homework 4. playing video games 5. feeding his pet\nOutput: 1, 2, 3, 4: I am pretty sure that the story was talking about \"doing a puzzle\" after dinner because that's what the story suggests.\n2, 3, or 4: The only possible reason for watching tv, doing homework, or playing video games is that the boy may be getting bored and playing video games because that's what he likes to do best.  This might be part of the story or may not.  It depends on the reader's interpretation\n5: Reading a book would be the most appropriate activity to do after the boy finishes his bath and goes to bed because then he wouldn't interrupt his mom. Moreover, \"suggests doing homework or playing video games\", makes sense in this context too. It could mean that he would do homework if he's bored and play video games if he doesn't feel like doing homework. \nSo the final answer to this question is 3. doing home works.\n\nInput: In a hospital, the pharmacy provides medication.

She said they would tell him what type of car he needed and that the best offer of the best price would follow. Choices: A: car insurance B: car dealership C: finance company D: car rental store E: auto body shop\nOutput: 1) The question is asking who the woman told him to call for his car needs.\n2) Choice A: Car insurance -  Insurance doesn't really have much to do with helping a person buy a car, though it might assist with repair costs if there's a car accident. Therefore, choice A: Car insurance is ruled out.\n3) Choice B: Car dealership - Car dealerships would most likely not tell a person what kind of car he needs or what the best offer price is, since this information is largely dependent upon specifics of each buyer's needs.\n4) Choice D: Car rental stores - Auto Body shops are stores that have vehicles for rent and repair, so it is unlikely they would have information on what kinds of new cars are best. Also, \"best\" often refers to the highest quality or the something that is most desirable, so a lot of people would not choose rental cars in the first place unless in a financial state of dire need. So, Choice D: Car Rental Stores is ruled out.\n 5) Car Dealerships might sell a car to you, but this is not the case, car shops like Finance companies or Auto body shops probably could not have the best offer for the best price as the woman stated.\n6) The only option remaining is, Choice E: Auto Body Shops would be most likely to fit the specified requirements.\nSo, the Final answer is E: Auto Body Shop\n\nInput: The boy said the dog, whose name is Snoopie, went out", "answer": " 20"}

Choices: \nA: fruit B: vegetables C: dairy D: meat E: grains\nOutput: 1) Considering the food items (fruit vs. meat) in a single meal is confusing. For instance, a typical American dinner might include meat, vegetables, and grains in one meal.\n2) Dairy products, namely beverages and milk, are an inherent part of many meals, often more than one meal each day.\n3) Thus, option D: food meal is not the answer. 4) Grains are also important staple foods in the global culinary tradition. There are also breakfast foods that do not fall into any of the given categories.\n5) Meat and dairy products are part of nearly every food meal. They can either be appetizers or side dishes that are eaten with the main course and desserts. In other words, they are never just one food item in a meal.\n6) Similarly, a typical modern breakfast may contain cereals or some type of bread or toast with cheese as part of the appetizer. Thus option D: \"fruit\" is too specific and too limiting.\n7) Similarly, choosing the dairy category is not a good choice.

{"text": "hand, is a term used to refer to a grouping of various stores that can include businesses like candy stores, dental offices, and fast food establishments. This means that it would be the most relevant choice.\n7. When you think of a strip mall in your mind, you are thinking of a place which houses some of these businesses. So, if a dental office and candy store can reside in a strip mall, then a fast food establishment can also be a part of it--thus making option D a correct answer.\nSo the final answers are D: strip mall and D: fast food establishment.

There is no way that they would see him coming!  What was his purpose for taking pictures of those present?   Choices:  A yellow B: black C: grey D: white E: orange\nOutput: 1 In this question, we see that a room was entering while people were eating. This implies that  there were people who were eating.\n2. Intruder (option A: yellow): Here yellow can't be the color on the door in the room which the intruder entered. The reason being it would be visible to the people who were there. Hence, it can't be the right option.\n3. In black (option B: black) we don't know who among the people had what color of door in their room. So this can't be the correct answer. \n4. There are two options left, C: Grey and D: White. \n5. Considering the second sentence C: grey is not applicable.  This makes the only remaining option to be left from the remaining two, option D: white. That is the correct answer.\nSo, the correct answer is D: white", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "hand, specifically refers to a locality with stores of various kinds in small buildings. Therefore, Strip mall (option D) could be the answer. \n7. A dentist office does not sell candy, so it wouldn't be next to a candy shop. A dentist office and candy store can't co-exist in the same location due to health regulations around food.\n8. Similarly, fast food cannot be located so close to a dentist, as there would be no need for a dental patient to eat the food. It is also unlikely that a dentist would want to be next to an area that would be attracting a lot of foot traffic. They may not even sell the candy, but their location is still likely to increase foot traffic near them due to the proximity to a strip mall.\n9. A dentist's office could be located alongside a candy store or candy distribution location, as they might share a similar type of costumer base who would regularly purchase candy. Hence, dentist office (option F) could be the right answer.\nSo the final solution is F: dentist office.\n\nInput: What city does the world's largest number of people live in? Choices: \n A: Toronto B: New York City C: Sydney D: Lagos E: Dubai\nOutput: 1) It should be noted that the question refers specifically to a city. \n2. It also mentions that Toronto, New York City and Sydney have a combined population of 88 million people, however, we don't know if the other cities' population is less than that or not. \n3. So, the question becomes more about what city is the largest among the cities listed. \n4. The question also implies that the population of the city must be larger than 88 million people. Therefore, the most reasonable answer out of the given choices is C: Sydney. This is because the population of Sydney in 2021 is about 5.3 million. \n5. Lagos and Dubai are two other options that have populations of 21 million and 4 million people respectively. However, the population of Lagos, Nigeria is estimated at 23 to 24 million people, meaning that it might have a population more than 88 million. Thus, these cities cannot be the answer.\n6.

A bear is a terrestrial animal, meaning it lives and moves on land. A rhino, however, is an animal that typically lives in or near water--so a bear could not be found in Florida, and the question is answered.\n3. Since animal B (bear) cannot be found in Florida, we focus on options E (elephant) and the others have a fair chance.\n4. Now, we need to determine if option E: ELEPHANT can be found in Florida. \n5. A quick online search indicates that elephants can be found in Florida as well as in other places like Texas (in zoos).\n6. Thus, EELPHANT (option E) cannot be found in florida.\n7. Therefore, we come down to answering W (whale). As Florida is a coastal state, we know whales can be found there.\n8. Option W (Whale) can be found in florida, and is the answer.\nSo the answer to the question is 'W' (Whale).\n\nInput: Which part of the human body has a greater temperature?

Choices: \n\nA: mass B: weight C: force D: friction E: speed\nOutput: 1: By looking at the question as a whole, we can infer that a stationary object is one that is not moving. This precludes the choices that describe motion, such as D: friction, E: speed.\n2: Further limiting the possible choices, it can be concluded that an object can't be stationary if it is moving upward and downward at different rates. This eliminates A: mass and B: weight because these quantities are used to describe both the upward and downward motions.\n3: Therefore, an object can't move if it is kept stationary by force, because in that situation, there is no net force acting on it. This eliminates the choice of C: force.\n4: Finally, the only selection left that isn't inconsistent with a stationary object is E: there is no speed.

'clean up after someone who has urinated' (because the mess is already done), or 'get rid of something that someone has done', because either of these actions can be taken to 'clean up' or 'get rid of' after someone has urinated. - As per these conditions, we do have an option here, 'clean up' means 'get rid of', but the question asks us to choose something different than 'clean up'.\n4. A lot of options can be eliminated here by analysing the conditions. 'clean and wag', because 'clean' means to get rid of, and wag means 'to move an animal's tail from side to side'. So this cannot be the correct answer, because'moving an animal's tail to the side' does not mean that it has been done. 'get rid of something', as in, 'clean and get rid of it', because this involves moving an object. - As per these actions, 'clean wagging' is still an incorrect answer.\n5. \"claim cleaning\", as in, it is a claim that he has \"cleaned\" something, while he in reality hasn't done the cleaning. - In this scenario, not only does this option involve the act of cleaning, but it also can be proven as false if the person who claims he has cleaned doesn't have any evidence except for a vague \"claiming to clean\".

Choices:  A cashier B store owner C floor manager D district manager E shift manager\nOutput: 1) The question is specifically asking about what kind of management personnel the cashier is complaining about to, not the name of that person.\n2) The cashier does not accept it and is angry, therefore the owner probably would too, the manager will also. However, the district manager (option E) is the higher level manager.\n3) The manager is responsible for the cashier and his team. Now the cashier is speaking to the manager who takes orders from the owner. The owner would also be frustrated if the manager doesn't take their side. The district manager (option E: district manager) is the person in charge of managing all of the managers which means they will have a say in what the cashier should say but they really don't get involve themselves in problems with customers. So as mentioned they will take orders from the owner and will have the least amount of say in what the cafier says.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is that the cashier is angry with the district manager\n\n### Instruction:The word on the card is an object.

Choices:  A baseball B: a baseball game C: a baseball team D: the baseball game\nOutput: \n1. The question requires us to choose the one correct option out of the choices from among 'A,' 'B,' 'C,' 'D.' \n2. Choice A: a baseball game doesn't make sense here because it is not specific to a baseball game. So choice A is not correct as an answer. \n3. Next, we analyze choice B: a baseball game. In this option, the word game is capitalized and this makes it odd that this choice is being presented as an option.\n4. Additionally, the choice refers to a \"baseball game\" and not a \"baseball\" which is odd since a game can also refer to a team or players of the game.\n5. Thus, this choice is ruled out as well.\n6. Next in line comes choice C: a baseball team. This word is not capitalized and its first letter is lowercase 'a' as opposed to the 'A' in the question.\n7. Therefore, this choice too gets eliminated as it isn't the right fit for the question. \n8. Lastly, we come to Choice D: an baseball game. This is the choice that satisfies all the conditions for being a correct option. This choice follows the same format in the question and has the same capitalization of 'A.' Thus, the answer to the question is: an baseball game.\nSo the correct answer is: D: an baseball game\n\nInput: A friend had a dental appointment with a new dentist.

Choices: 1. A: Vulture   2. B: Eagle  3. C: Ostrich  4. D: Falcon  5. E: Hawk \nOutput: 1: The question seeks to find a bird that lives in a mountain area.\n2: Based on this information, the bird could be defined as \"living in mountains\" or \"being mountain-dwelling\". So we can eliminate the options which do not fit this description. For example, since the location is'mountains', we can eliminate A: Vulture because it resides in deserts among other locations. \n3: Since it's said to \"live\" in a mountain area, we can further reject option C: Ostrich because it resides in flat areas such as savanahs and deserts.\n4: We cannot define a bird that lives in the mountains as an \"eagle\" because an eagle is not naturally mountain-dwelling and generally lives in grasslands or deserts.  \n5: We can reject option E: Hawk. Since it lives in mountains, we know an option B: Falcon or D: Falcon must be true. \nThus, based on logical eliminations, options B: Falcon and D: Falcon can be true.\nSo the final two answer choices are B: Falcon and  D: Falcon. \nNow lets pick an option which follows the grammar rules correctly.

In short, we should listen and not think only of our response while listening to the other person speak.\n4. Therefore B: listening is the right choice.\n5. Repeating what the other person said or nodding can also be an indication of understanding the other person.\n6. For instance, when someone is trying to convey an idea and we don\u2019t understand it fully, we can repeat what they said and ask for more clarification. This will also help them clarify their point.\n7. Similarly, nodding when listening to them can be an indication that we are attentively hearing them.\n8.

Widowing\nOutput: 1) The question begins by mentioning that a city council voted to replace old parks and recreations signs. This means that a lot of work and effort has been put into getting to this point, and the old signs will be replaced by new ones.\n2) Voting and replacement are not the most significant parts of the project, according to the question. Instead, the replacement of the signs would be one of several significant aspects of this project. Therefore, the main part of the project would probably involve the replacement of the signs.\n3) When the city council voted to replace these signs, it was probably important to consider issues like the need for replacements and the overall design of the new signs.\n4) Based on this, the main part of this project was probably focused on finding a good solution for the signs, rather than just installing them. Therefore, the correct choice here is replacement and not installation.\n5) The question mentions that parks and recreation are the two primary reasons for replacing and installing these new signs, which points to recreation being the more significant aspect out of these two.\n6) Based on this, rec room and maintenance are incorrect answer choices because recreation and maintenance are not the most significant aspects of this project to replace old signs.\n7) The question then references another significant aspect of the project, which was installing the new signs.\n8) This means that installation is a necessary part of the project; it isn't the most significant part, but is included in the main components of this project.\n9) The last part of the question states that the project was complete, implying that all the planned aspects had been taken into account and completed by the city", "answer": " 700"}

Because of the shared parking, a candy store and a fast food joint could feasibly be next to each other.\n7. A dental office might be located in a strip mall because of space and the ability to share employees by catering to dental patients.\n8. As the question provides no information about the dental office, we can take this option with a grain of salt for the moment.\n9. Thus, the most likely scenario would be that a candy store, fast food joint, and a dental office would be located in a shared strip mall area.\n10.

Choices:  C: musicals D: documentaries E: fantasies F: horror\nOutput: 1- Choice B is ruled out because it says \"directors.\"\n\n2. Choice A is also ruled out as its definition is \"a film that combines recorded audio with visual images.\" This does not rule out fantasies.\n\n3. Choice D is ruled out as the definition says \"a film about a subject that is not fiction, and is presented as a fact usually through footage of real events.\" This fits in with horror movies as they are about real experiences of living people, even if the footage is fictional (i.e. zombies, werewolves, etc. are not real). For example, \"Night of the living dead.\"\n\n4. Choice E is ruled out as \"a story that could have happened and normally includes some kind of magic or unbelievable happenings.\" This clearly doesn't fit into the definition as \"supernatural events or imaginary creatures are important\" and that isn't true for fantasies.\n5. Choice F is ruled out as \"tells of people being scared by a living thing, such as vampires, witches, and ghosts.\" All three of those categories are horror movies.\n6. Choice G is ruled out as \"the opposite of a musical.\" A musical is an audio with visuals where there is singing.\n\n7. There is only one choice that fits with all the given criteria and the definition. It is D: documentaries.\n\nSo the final correct choice is E: fantasies\n\nInput: There is an argument between many groups over different ideas in the country.

Choices:  * A: ostrich * B: donkey * C: camel * D: beaver * E: zebra.\nOutput: 1) We need to understand the context of the question to narrow down the choices. \n2) The first sentence of the question states that the French are known for eating a particular animal. \n3) It can be inferred that the question is asking about what animal the French are known to eat.\n6. Considering that the list provided includes ostrich, donkey, camel, beaver, and zebra, the answer is likely an African animal.\n7. As the French typically reside in Europe and not in Africa, it can be assumed that the question is referring to a specific African animal, and not an African country or region as a whole.\n6. It is possible that some people from Africa may eat beavers, but the French do not typically refer to this type of animal as the main livelihood of their entire population.\n10. From the list of options provided, the only African animals that are consumed are \"donkey\" and \"zebra.\" \"Donkey\" is not likely related to food consumption habits, and \"zebra\" cannot be the right answer. \n11. The only remaining answer would appear to be \"zebra.\"\n12. The French are known for ecology and conservation, but zebra are not known for being a predominant animal for consumption in the French culinary scene.\n13. Further research supports this conclusion-- zebra is not widely eaten by people in French-speaking areas.\nSo the final Answer is B: donkey\n\nInput: The professor will not let you retake the exam.

Choices:  Ukraine A: Kyiv, Uzbekistan B: Tashkent, Canada C: Ottawa, Russia D: Moscow, Romania E: St. Petersburg, USA\nOutput: 1) In the given answer choices only E(USA) is left. \n2) The US is the only country that spells its capital 'St. Petersburg'.\n3) The question is about the capital, not the name of the country. Thus, Option B(Russia) and Option C(Canada) are ruled out. \n4) We can also rule out option D(Russia) as it is not the capital. Option D would probably be spelled as 'Moscow' and not 'Moscow, Russia'.\n5) The remaining answer choices are left with Ukraine as only other option that has 'Kiev' as their capital.\n6) We can rule out option A(Ukraine) as it is located in the far east and its capital isn't 'Kiev', but Kyiv which looks quite different.\n7) We are then left with the only possible answer, option E(USA).\n\nInput: Where would a person likely eat more food when on a trip?

So when we see this pattern, one choice is easy and another one is hard. So option 1: slow and working and one option is fast and working. One is slow and working is easy and one is fast and working, so that means we can find the answer.\n5: We then apply the same logic like we did for the third question.\n6: Again we see the pattern of easy working and then hard working. So the answer can be either slow and easy or fast and hard working. So we can eliminate one option from the two. We need to select one of them. By ruling out the fourth option, we have no choice left.\n7: So we end up being the answer for the second question.\n8: We find the answer by applying the same logic and patterns that we found in the third question for option and option two.\n1.

The first thing that can be done with this question is weeding out choice A (the earth is like a disk) which means the question cannot be about earth's shape.\n3. The next thing that can be done is combining and eliminating A and B (earth is a sphere, has land) which leaves us with C and D (earth is like a sphere, does not have holes).\n4. Both C and D are relevant as we know by the end of this question is about shape and how shape affects the planet.\n5. However, C (earth has land) is incorrect as land does not describe a specific attribute of the shape of Earth (it is, after all, a ball).\n6. Thus, D (it is like a ball) is the best option given the context of the question.\n7. We can further reduce this to D (earth is round, like a ball) as the other options (like a disk, does not have holes) are also out.\n8.

The woman's fear is based on what her class might be late for, so it makes sense to identify the class that the woman is late for.\n3. Out of all the classes we are told about in the paragraph, we find out that there are only two that can be late for a birthday, they being Work and Dance.\n4. Out of these, we can eliminate work since the woman says she asked about how long it would take the CLASS to get home, and so it would be a CLASS that she is worried about being too late for.\n5.

Choices: 1. A: shades B: wetter C: taller D: shorter E: bigger\nOutput: 1) A: The heat is dry but sunlight is required for the plant to survive. Given that the sunlight in desert area is dry and hot, we are looking for some mechanism in the plant that allows it to survive and produce fruit.\n2) B: If the plant is too short for its shadows during hot dry weather then it will need to be kept watered more often. This suggests that the plant doesn't do well when it is watered too often, which makes this choice wrong as plants grow better when they are well watered. For instance, we don't see desert cacti and palm trees growing well in deserts in South America and North Africa because they are too small to cast a shadow and they don't have any foliage.\n3) C: If the plant is growing upward in elevation to get closer to light then it will be more difficult for it to survive in hot dry weather. Hence, the plant will need a mechanism that allows it to live through longer periods of time. 4) D: If the plant has a sturdy structure or it is a large plant then it will be able to survive better during hot desert weather. But if the plant is lacking in this quality then it won't grow well. So this is also a choice that has been ruled out. 5) E: If a plant produces more leaves and is stronger then it will have bigger shade. This is true only if the plant is large enough.

Choices: \tA: South B: North C: East D: West E: Northwest\nOutput: 1). The question asks us which direction is it possible to go to a beach on the southern side of Coolangata but a little north of the beach it's possible from the bridge on the northern side of Coolanghta.\n2). We start by observing that the beach on the south of Coolanght is adjacent to its north, which implies the possible directions are south, east, west and north.  \n3). Now we need to identify which directions lead to the desired beach.\n4). The North-West direction leads us to a bridge or a causeway which leads us to a beach.\n5). The South direction doesn't lead us to the desired beach. But when we look at the clues we find out that the South direction leads us to another beach.\n6). Now look at the options carefully.\n7). As the question says, West leads us to a bridge and then we have another beach and east leads us to a bridge that leads us to a Causeway and we have the beach.\n8). Thus A: South is not an applicable option.\n9). Both the directions D: West and E: North-West lead us to the beach.\n10).

Choices:  C: United Arab Emirates D: Brazil E: China\nOutput: 1 The question is asking about the longest street in the World if we don't consider the country?\n2. This suggests that there is a well-known street called the 'longest road in the world', but we don't know its length.\n3. The length of the \u2018longest street in the world\u2019 is often related to the length of the country, and this cannot be the answer to this question.\n4. This immediately rules out choice E: China as the longest street in China is the one in Beijing which is longer than the city itself.\n5. The same can be applied to choice B: Brazil as the longest street there is 5218 km in length which is not the answer required.\n6. This leaves us with choices C: United Arab Emirat and D: Brazil.\n7. If we go into choices then we notice that choice C: United Arab Emiraites has the first longest street in the world which is about 70 km long which is a lot less than the answer of C: United Arab Emirtates which is approximately 1.5 million km long.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be either A: United Arab Emirate or B: Brazil. This could be an educated guess from the fact that the word \u2018street \u2019 refers to a type of avenue that could be easily mistaken as a road or the longest street.\n9.

Choices:  a: evaporation, condensation, and precipitation; b: ice water, steam, and ice water; c: evaporation, transportation, and condensation; d: evaporation, cooling, and condensation,  e: evaporation, precipitation, and condensation\nOutput: 1.The question is asking about the parts of water cycle.\n2. The water cycle occurs when water evaporates from lakes, oceans, and the atmosphere. Then it rises up and falls back to earth.\n3. When it rains, it is precipitation that has already condensed and fallen back down. So, choice B: ice water, steam and ice water is not the correct answer\n4. Similarly, Choice C: evaporation, transit and condensation is not the right answer since these options talk about water evaporating and falling back but not transporting water.\n5. Water cycle also includes condensation in which water evaporates and condenses into cloud, so D: evaporation, heat, and condensation is incorrect.\n6. As condensation does not happen in the cloud, it is not a step that follows evaporation. Also, the option mentions transportation, not cooling.\n7. Hence, we will eliminate D, and C.\n8. That leaves us with A: evaporation, evaporation, precipitations, which says there are three process, but as stated earlier the water cycle has four steps.\n9. But, from the option we can tell one of the step is the same. Therefore, A is eliminated.\n10. Out of the remaining options, E: evaporation, precies, condensation has the correct answer.

Choices:  A. paralyzed B. tight C. loosened D. relaxed E. overworked\nOutput: 1) We know that a man's body feels fatigue. \n2) As per the question, the wording suggests that a man cannot get enough air because breathing muscles are not working properly.\n3) The word fatigue is mentioned - 'deep' implies severe, long-lasting exhaustion that impairs everyday activities. This suggests difficulty breathing and suggests some kind of paralysis (or weakness) of the air muscles. Hence choice A: paralyzed seems like a possible choice.\n4) Choice B: tight - this doesn't seem to match as it suggests restriction or constriction (tightening up)\n5) Choice C: loosened - too long-winded of a sentence and not consistent with question\n6) Choice D: relaxed - we know his muscles are not working because he is fatigued, so relaxed doesn't seem to make sense\n7) So, the answer is A: paralyzing, which is a situation when a man's body shows signs of extreme physical or mental exhaustion, which might lead to inability to work properly.\nSo the final choice is A: paralysis.\n\nInput: When the temperature outside falls, a man wears a jacket to _______.

Children can learn confidence by trying new things they are not familiar with. So this option is the correct response.\n4) Option D: by reading classic writing is not a reliable way to instill confidence. Reading classic fiction can be done on a level playing field with other readers, so it does not directly equate to improving social skills or standing out (i.e., confidence in one's abilities).\n5) Option E: by doing home work is not a valid option.

The U.K. and China prefer steak and pasta choices.  What is your best guess of the next preference? Choices:  Restaurant food B: Sweets C: Stew D: Beans E: Dessert\nOutput: 1) The question makes the assumption that the U.S. prefers cafeteria style and not restaurant food. This is because the question states that they 'prefer' cafeterias and then mentions that U.S.A is also part of the U.S.\n2) \"Preference\" implies a personal liking for something. Thus, a restaurant cannot be the answer unless there are no U.S. citizens in the U.S. \n3) \"Prefer\" is being used to describe this situation in which a few countries prefer cafeteria-style dining to restaurant food. \n4) Similarly, the text also implies that it should be an option for the next preference \"What is your best guess of next option?\" It must be a choice because it is not a question but an option which is a future possibility.\n5) There is also the context of a global conversation between individuals from different countries.

Choices:  (A) 4\" (B) 8\" (C) 2\" (D) 12\" (E) 20\"\nOutput: 1) The question involves determining the height of a 6-inch pie.\n2) The phrase \u201cthe cake placed on an 8 inch pie\u201d indicates that the cake is raised.\n3) The cake is placed on top of the pie so the cake will rise until the cake covers the entire pie.\n4) From the facts provided in the question, there are no constraints on how the cake will rise.\n5) The cake may rise in any amount, given the pie is square and of the same diameter.\n6) The given options describe the height in relation to the pie.\n7) So, for an 8 inch diameter pie, the cake may rise 4 inches, 8 inches, 12 inches, or 20 inches.\n8) Hence A, B and D are incorrect since the height of the cake describes the height less than 8 inches. \n9) So choice E is the correct answer since the cake may rise by 6 inches, resulting in a height = 8 inches.\n10) The remaining options cannot apply to an 8 inch cake, given that the cake is placed on a pie of the same dimension.\nSo the final anser is E: 6 inch\n\nInput: The two best friends, James and Jack, always made plans together.

The team captain said one-word when we asked how the team would spend their time after the game. \n2) This indicates that there was only one word chosen by the captain to describe their plans.\n3) The question now asks us to guess what word they would have chosen to describe their plans. This provides us with the following constraints.\n4) The word must not be A together, B not, C happy, D at or E tired.\n5) Because a team will typically spend time together after a game, option A cannot be the answer and also option B can\u2019t be the answer. \n6) Hence, the only option left that fits these assumptions is option D E: tired. It\u2019s clear that the team has been playing for long and after their game, will be very tired. \n7) To ensure that only the option that answers this riddle with the right reasoning can be chosen as the answer choice, we have to check if the answer is relevant to fit the given information.\n8) The team will typically be tired after their game for a considerable amount of time.

It's all a waste of time \nOutput: 1: The question describes the hypothetical scenario of a student missing an exam.\n2. This immediately eliminates option E: is a waste of time, which suggests that the scenario in question is unlikely.\n3. The remaining options either express outcomes that are dependent on the test score or make assumptions about how a failing score would affect the student.\n4. Option a: this option says nothing about testing or scoring. Therefore, it is unlikely the most accurate answer.\n5. Option c: this option states that score of 1/10 course grade implies that the course score is very poor (the grade will not be the same as the score on the course). This gives out the information that the student was already poor in the subject. It also makes an assumption about the student's overall test grade.\n6. Option d: this option states that the final exam is 1/3 of the course grade. If the test score is 0 and the total score is 1/3, then the test score needs to also be 0. A student's test score being 0 or 1 would imply the student was very poor in the subject and hence scoring 1/10 the grade. While options c and d may both be valid, the text states that the final exam score is 1/10th of the course, but option d implies that test score should be a multiple of the course, but the final exam score is a fraction of it.

It means that it costs more to travel if another person is involved in order to pay for repairs.\n5) When a drunk driver crashes into objects, the car will usually need more repairs, and therefore \"injuries require visit\"s to the emergency room.\n6) None of the other answer choices describe a scenario in which the driver is intoxication leading to'vehicle crashes\".\n7) So, the correct answer is choice B: \"Injuries require visit to the emergency room.\"\nSo the final answer, by elimination, is B: \"Injurie's require a visit to the emergency.\"\n\nInput: Is a wolf ever found in a ___?

Choices: 1. was born by c-section in a hospital 2. has 2 other relatives who are named John and Mary 3. has brown hair 4. was born in the 1980s 5. has no siblings but is related to many cousins 6. was adopted by parents in the United States 7. was left on a doorstep when they were 18 months old\nOutput: The question describes a scenario in which the individual in question has certain physical and personal characteristics that would make it believable that the person is the child of another.\n1. It's important to recognize that each of the options presented has their own unique set of attributes and that each has a much lower chance of being a person's child than the other.\n2. Since the description says \"born\" it could be interpreted as implying that 'by c-section' can either make or break the probability of someone being your child. Though this is debatable the fact that someone was born by c- section or not wouldn't probably be used as a conclusion to answer the question as given.\n3. The other attributes include brown hair, born in the 1800s and a lot of cousins.\n4. So we see that these attributes make it almost certain that this person is not your child as brown hair was not given, John is a masculine name and Mary a feminine name.  But to eliminate an attribute, we should know when an attribute is given.\n5. Not having siblings is given as a possibility of a child belonging to a particular person.  So there is a possibility that this person doesn't have any siblings. They can still be your child, as long as they don't have siblings then the other criteria can follow", "answer": " 32"}

Choices: 1. A: The bat\n2. B: The dog\n3. C: The bite\n4. D: The vampire\n5: E: the owner of the bat\nOutput: 1: This can easily be eliminated because it doesn't change anything about the situation, it\u2019s just stated that a dog becomes a vampire when \"bitten by a bat\".\n2: This will only change the owner of the bat. The owner of the dog does not become a vampire and there is no mention of the dog at all.\n3: The dog bites the bat and they both become vampires. This changes the relationship but does not change the dog.\n4: The dog bites a bat, transforming itself into a vampire in the process. This doesn't change the owner of the vampire.\n5: The owner of the bat is not the dog, it is a vampire. It is changed by the dog biting a bat but this does not change how they are both still a vampire.\nThe only correct answer to this question is:\n\nC) the bite. The bite turns them both into a vampire. The bite might also have the side effect of changing the owner of the bat due to turning the bat into a vampire but this is not explicitly stated to be so.\nSo the final choice will be C: the bite.\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade 9 reading comprehension question.\n\nInput:'Ms. Rhee, an award-winning teacher, and her two children were on an airplane.

Choices:  the answer is C. \"relieved\" D: the answer is E. \"disappointed\"\nOutput: 1: The phrase \"the two countries\" in the question could be referring to any two countries. The details given in the question about the two countries being able to \"revisit many topics to discuss in a manner that was frank, direct and with mutual respect\" suggest that the countries felt very positive about their relationship with the other country. This indicates that the answer to this question should be \"relieved\". However, if the phrase \"the two countries 1st\" was there in the question, instead of simply \"the two countries\", then the context of the conversation would suggest that the countries were not able to resolve all topics in a comfortable way, which would indicate that the countries were relieved to be leaving the conversation. So, this option is not acceptable in that case scenario and the correct answer in that case scenario would be \"disappointed\".\n2: If the question was asking about a relationship between two people, then the phrase \"the two\" would refer to those people, and the options could include \"relieved\", \"disappointed\", or \"overwhelmed\". So, the correct answer to this question would be \"relieved\", \"overwhelmed\", or \"disappointed\"; options A, B, and C.\n\nInput: They were going to hold a concert by The Beach Boys in the new arena's outdoor space.

Choices:  I A: pears B: pumpkins C: potatoes D: oranges E: peaches\nOutput: There are many types on apples but red tartt is only a single type. The question is looking for the types of apples that red tartt grows on.  Therefore the answer could be from choice A or choice B or choice C or choice.\nThe phrase \"many types of apple\" indicates a wider array of choices than those found in a single fruit. It includes various types of apples grown on red tartt, as well as other apples. Therefore, the answer has to be A, B or C.\nSince the question is asking specifically for a fruit, it is necessary to eliminate choice D ORGANGES, this is because oranges are a fruit but not a fruit found on Red Tartt. \nThe next possibility that could be eliminated is choice E PEACH, similarly,peaches are a fruit but not found on red tartt, so the correct option is A, B, and C.\n\n## Example 7\nInput: There are a lot of things that people see when they visit their country of origin.

{"text": "hand, usually contains small-scale businesses that are situated side-by-side. This could potentially be the right fit. It may or may not have a dental office, candy store or fast-food place nearby. However, we need to evaluate each candidate to find the most likely.\n7. A dental office typically requires a clean environment and may have strict rules around its building space. A candy store or a quick-serve fast food business would be challenging to place within the same location as a dental office because they emit strong odors and fumes. Moreover, the foods available in such establishments tend to attract flies and may have germs and allergens that could be hazardous for people with medical conditions. Therefore, the dental office can only be located where it will have its own space away from the candy and fast-food restaurants. Option D: strip mall is ruled out, as this is where multiple businesses are located side-by-side usually in residential settings.\n8. Now let's turn to evaluating C: school and E: urban area. A school is unlikely to house a dental office or a candy store. An urban area could be anywhere in the city, including residential neighborhoods, so it would be difficult to choose whether it is more or less likely to house all these businesses next to each other. Thus, both options are eliminated.\n9. We can now focus on option B: hospital because a hospital usually contains a cafeteria and might sell candy products for fundraisers. The hospital setting may not be the best for a dental office or fast food restaurant due to its high sanitation and hygiene standards; however, the candy store can be placed in the hospital cafeteria or at a different part of the hospital premises. Thus, option B: hospital is the most likely option which could house a dental office.\nSo the final answers are all B: hospital\n\nInput: How do you use a plunger?

We can eliminate options 2 and 4 because they refer to different kinds of information that the student will need.\n3) We can eliminate option 3 because it refers to information that will be easily found online.\n4. We can eliminate option 4 because using word of mouth may not be the most reliable method to find the information.\n5) We can eliminate option because taking a class on research is probably not the fastest way to complete the research needed for a research paper.\nTherefore, we can safely say that the answer is 1) Go to the reference desks.\n\nInput: A gymnast has to stretch out to make perfect handstands.

A: carnivore B: herbivore  C: omnivore D: frugivore A) carnivore can eat meat\nB) carnivore is the opposite of herbivore\nC) carnivore and herbivore both eat meat\nD) frugivores only eat fruit\nOutput: 1) The question is about which of these animals will eat meat. \n2) This means the animal will have a diet that mostly consists of meat. \n3) Now, to answer the question, we will analyze all four animals: carnivore, herbivore, omnivore, and frugivore, to understand if they do eat meat. \n4) Carnivores: These animals only eat meat and no plants. Therefore, option A: carnivores is the answer. \n5) It is the opposite of herbiovores: animals that only eat plants, and not animals. So option B: herbivores can be eliminated. \n6) Herbiovores consume only plants in their diet. So, we will consider omnivores that are animals that both eat meat and plants.\n7) Omnivores eat both meat and plants so option C: omnivores is incorrect. \n8) Finally, we consider frugivores - animals that only eat fruits. Now fruits are a type of food, and they can be taken apart into flesh and seeds.

This implies that the person has had a recent instance of food poisoning, rather than a past one.\n\n1. The question describes what the food has been placed on- A person's plate, not necessarily their hand. Thus, option A: not touching the food is not possible.\n2. The question mentions that the food at a buffett is \"touching\" the food that other people's plates, that they are eating from. Hence option B: Not taking enough care is incorrect.\n3. The cited reason behind the food poisoning is the food being \"made on a conveyor belts\". It doesn't provide details about where this conveyor belt is used, specifically.

Choices: A: minus F B: 39 degrees C: 1.8 degrees D: 0 degrees E: plus F\nOutput: 1 At the beginning of the question, we can understand that ice begins to melt when the temperature is at a certain level, which means it is above freezing.\n2 At a temperature of 1.8 degrees, we see that ice has a tendency to begin to melt.\n3. When the temperature is at 39 degrees we observe that ice begins to break up and lose its solidness.\n4. But at a temperature of zero degrees, we are not able to see ice melting completely.\n5.

{"text": "hand, is a small shopping district that typically contains businesses catering to people like dental offices, candy stores, and fast food places. So option D: strip mall may be the correct answer. However, one needs to check whether it is possible to build all these types of businesses next to each other.\n7. A dental office is usually housed in a separate structure from the fast food place and the candy store. So it is unlikely that a dental office would be next to a candy shop and a fast food establishment.\n8. A hospital likely does not host a dental office. However, it might have a candy shop and/or a fast food place nearby if it is at a hospital medical campus.\n9. A school doesn't typically have a candy shop - it may sell candy for fundraising, but it's not a regular source of candy for students. It does not allow a fast food place to sit next to it either since it has to adhere to health standards.\n10. A strip mall could definitely be the correct answer. All you need to do is to analyze and understand what it is. A strip mall contains businesses similar to those stated and one could, therefore, house the types mentioned. However, the question specifically stated that the locations were found within a building, which would eliminate that option.\n11. Given the above reasoning and analysis, the correct answer to this question is D: strip mall.\nSo the final Answer is D: strip mALL\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the followings grade algebra question.\n\n\n\n\n\nInput: A student bought 10 pounds of rice.

D: rain drops C: ice C: snow\nOutput: 1: This question asks about what causes glaciers to form.\n2. Answering this question requires analyzing the question in light of what is known about glaciers.\n3. A glacier is a large mass of ice.\n4. The water is frozen into a solid lattice of ice as opposed to a liquid, and the large ice sheet moves under its own weight.\n5. Based on the information provided, we can eliminate choices B and C as they do not directly cause the formation of glaciations.\n6. We are left with choices A and D.\n7. The formation of a glaciation occurs when snow and ice accumulates on the mountaintop and eventually flows downward to a valley.\n8. As part of this process, rain drops and even snowflakes become frozen, which further contributes to the increase of the glacier.\n9. So, the answer to this is A. Water precipitation helps to create a glacier.\nSo Glaciers in the context of this question are created from water precipitation and snowflakes forming and sticking together.\n\n### Your submission was graded with a total of 176 incorrect answers.

A: someone B: no one C: nobody D: someone E: nothing\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about who invented \"Tic-Tac-Toe\" or what we commonly refer to as, Noughts and Crosses. \n2) The options exclude A, B and D as 2,4,6 are all numbers and are not accepted as choices.\n3) E might be an answer as tic tac toe can be referred to as nothing in a sense, but we accept 'nothing' as a answer.\n4) B is not acceptable as it clearly refers to a group of people.\n5) For the remaining question, we must first determine what word tic-tac- toe should represent. \n6) It is commonly accepted that Tic Tac Toe should represent Crosses, and since we exclude it, that allows us to further rule out A and B \n7) After determining that Tic Tac toe is likely to refer to Crosses, C clearly represents the answer as it is simply 'nobody'. Answers C, D and E then, become valid options.\n8) B is still not acceptable as it refers to a group of humans and we rejected it previously. \n9) 'Nobody' fits this scenario well but only the answer C and D remain as choices. \n10) It can be said that it would have been harder to find the person who invented Tic-Tac- Toe if it was invented much later by people belonging to a group.

Choices:  _____ A: triangle B: square C: octagonal box D: octagon E: pizza\nOutput: 1: The question is asking for a shape that has four sides and no 'hands'.\n2. We start by eliminating all of the choices based on this criteria.\na. Triangles and squares are both two-dimensional shapes, and if you stretch them out into the third dimension, they both have handles or 'hands' on each edge.\nb. Octagons and octagonal boxes can also have eight sides, but an octagonal box would also include eight hands.\n3. Therefore, the question wants us to find either something that is eight-sided or eight-handed.\n4. An octagon is an eight-sided shape, and it does not have eight hands. In other words, an octagon is a shape that could be cut into eight equal pieces.\n5. On the other hand, an octagonal box is shaped like an octagon, but it does have eight sides and eight handles.\n6.

An individual with an education degree cannot conduct research about the topic of their degree. In this sense, it doesn't seem like such a degree qualifies a person to conduct research.\n5) In option D: lead the study, the key words are \"lead the study\".

A lagoon, also known as a 'laguna' in Spanish, is a body of shallow water, typically in a protected or sheltered area or landlocked with no outlet to the sea or oceans. Hence, option 1: lagoon is correct.\n3. Pond also refers to a body of inland water but it is less deep as compared to a lagoon and often has a natural outlet.\n4. An estuary is a partially enclosed body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. Hence, option 3: estuary is incorrect.\n5. A floodplain is an area on the flat surface of the earth that is covered by or at high risk to encounter water during floods. This isn't suitable in this context.\n6.

Choices: 1. They are being pushed at speeds by another bumper car in the same line 2. Some parts of the ride's design are protected 3. They are on ice rink carpet instead of pavement\nOutput: 1.The question is asking for which of the choices would be the best explanation to why bumper cars are never given speeding tickets.\n2. Explanation for bumper cars are protected by the rules of the park - i.e. if the bumper cars are always slowing down while driving on a collision course for each other, they will never achieve high enough speeds to be able to receive speeding tickets. Thus Option 1: \"They are being pushed at specials by another bumper cars in the same line\" is a valid option.\n3. Another option may be that instead of driving on pavement like cars that would get speeding tickets, bumper cars are driven on the surface of ice rink carpet.\n4. When car collisions are planned to happen, they are not considered to be breaking the rules of the park.\n5. Hence Option 2: \"Some parts of the ride' not being protected\" is not a valid option.\n6. Option 3: \"They are on ice rink\" because of that they are always driving slow, they might be given speeding tickets because of the ice surface. But due to the rules of the park, the speed limit for all cars is 5 mph and if they are following this rule, they can be protected from fines by the parks rules.\n7. So the correct answer will be Option 1: \"they are being pushed at specially by another bumper in the same line\".", "answer": " 426000"}

The text explicitly states the question is about the tallest buildings in a town. The only 'non-buildings' listed are stores, so store is the only choice that can't be the tallest. Therefore, all other choices cannot be correct. \n3. Building 'A': library contains books; it's not a building type that is typically measured for height like other buildings do.\n4. Building 'B' is not a building that is typically measured for it's height; it's more used as a name for school-based buildings in a larger area that is a school district.\n5. Building 'C': church contains no mention of its height as its typical usage is not measured for height, whereas other buildings such as tallest store are.\n6. Building D: town hall is not likely to be the tallest building or a building that has the height measured.\n7. This leaves only building 'E': tallest store as the correct answer to the prompt.

Choices: A: They have better plans for the next sunny day B: They would get really tired C: They would be forced to move D: They would get stranded E: They would be too hot to move\nOutput: 1.\"If an iceberg was to _ (sink)_\" means that we would expect this event to happen.\n2. If an iceberg were to start sinking, the people on it would need to act accordingly. Otherwise, they could potentially face the negative consequences stated in the choices.\n3. When an iceberg sinks, it would likely have an effect on the people on it, depending on the direction and magnitude of the event. \n4. Option A: \"They have better plans for the sunny day\" implies that they have a different plan in case of an iceberg sinking. This doesn't match the scenario.\n5. Option B: \" They would get really tired\" is a possible outcome of being on an iceberg for a long time and thus doesn't seem to fit the question.\n6. Option C: \"They would be forced to move\" is a possible action for these people. If the iceberg starts sinking, the people would likely want to evacuate, causing them to be moved or forced to move. There is a risk involved if they refuse to move and thus the option is incorrect.\n7. Option D: \"They would be stranded\" is another option that can occur if the people on an iceberg refuse to evacuate or the route to escape the iceberg is blocked. However, in this scenario, we are talking about what would happen to people on an iceberg which suggests that they would likely evacuate to save themselves. \n8. Option E: \"They would be too hot to be moving\" is a potential outcome for these people if the ice starts melting due to water entering the iceberg and if that water is warm. However, option E: \"They would get (too) hot\" implies that this would not occur until after the iceberg reached sunny day conditions. Since these can happen", "answer": " 41"}

This is a red flag indicating an answer that doesn\u2019t quite fit the given information.\n7) Option C mentions the number 7\u2014if the woman stopped counting after the number 6, then her son would be 6 years old, which is different than 15.

Choices: \tA: light \tB: sound \tC: kinetic \tD: potential \tE: heat \tF: radio waves\nOutput: 1.) \"Sound energy\" is definitely not one of the four types of energy that can be found. \"Sound energy\" is sound waves that travel through the air. It cannot be stored, it cannot be converted to other forms of energy, and you cannot measure it in joules.\n\n2.) \"Light energy\" is energy that is emitted or transmitted by light, such as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet. This is not one of the four forms of energy because it cannot be classified under any of the four categories. \n\n3.) \"Kinetic energy\" is the energy that an object or system has when in motion. It can be stored or used to do work, so it is classified as non-renewable.\n4.) \"Potential energy\" is a form of energy stored in position due to the object's position relative to a force field. This can be converted to other forms, such as kinetic energy, but it is not classified as a type of energy in terms of being one of the four forms.\n\n5.) \"Heat energy\" is the random motion of atoms or molecules in a substance and is a form of energy that can be measured in joules. \"Radio waves\" are a form of electromagnetic waves and can be classified under light as they share one basic property--the ability to carry information.  \n\n6.) Because \"Heat energy\" can be stored and measured, it falls into the category of one of the four forms and is not the answer to this question. Similarly, \"Radio waves\" can also be classified under light since they share one basic property with light--the ability to carry and transfer information.\n\n7.) The correct answer is choice F - \"Radio waves\" are classified under Light because they share one basic property - the ability to carry information. All of the choices", "answer": " 100"}

Option A: A piece of fruit is not a particularly useful way to help a person study if it doesn\u2019t contain a lot of sugar.\n3. Option B: Dry fruit is likely too hard to eat while studying.\n4. Option C: Fruit juice sounds like it could be useful, but we should only consider that option if the person is a person who enjoys fruit juice.\n5. Option D: An apple can be useful but, as a general rule, doesn\u2019t help people study any better.\n6. Option E: Mango or other fruits with a lot of sugar content are much more useful because, in order to keep studying, a person needs to have enough energy.

An intro is quite similar to the refrain, also called the intro, which is at the beginning of a song and it builds up to the rest of the song. So, it is quite similar to the first chorus, where the first chorus, intro, and the refrain are the main parts of a song. 7. The bridge is the final part of a song where the singers take a moment to relax and enjoy their vocals. 8.

E: sousaphone\nOutput: 1 - It is common knowledge that the trumpet is a brass instrument, specifically designed for playing the high, piercing notes.\n2 - Clarinets are smaller woodwind instruments, making them smaller in size and lower in pitch.\n3 - The baritone sax is a member of the saxophone family, but it is larger than the ordinary sax.\n4 - A euphonium is an even larger version of a baritone sax.\n5 - A sousaphone, also known as a bombardin, is designed to be held in the crook with one arm and played with the other. \nChoices: 1. Answer - A: trumpet, 2. Answer - C: baritone\n\nInput: What is something you can do to keep from getting hurt by a fire? Choices:  Clean your windows Choose an insurance company Make sure all your furniture has been tested for flammability\nOutput: 1 The question is asking about actions that we can take to prevent our furniture from burning.\n2. It\u2019s clear from the context of the question that the answer isn't something that we would generally do in case of a fire. So it has to be something related to keeping our property safe from fire.\n3. Insurance companies sell plans that protect us from loss in the event of a fire.\n4. While window cleaning can help with general home maintenance, it doesn\u2019t directly address the issue of being protected from a future fire.\n5. Cleaning the furniture before a fire does help as it could make it less likely to ignite but doesn't actually prevent it from burning. Inspecting beforehand can help with this.\n6.

It was very warm in the place and the tables were too far apart.  How else could this affect the guests after the reception? Choices:  D: a lot E: so much F: a little G: some\nOutput: 1: The question asks about what affect another factor could have on the guests after the wedding reception. \n2. The given clues provide some insights into the situation that may have resulted in guests feeling under the weather.\n3. First, they were in a warm place, so it could be possible that the heat may have been uncomfortable or even made some of them sick.\n4. Second, the tables appeared to be too far apart, which could result in guests feeling crowded or uncomfortable, possibly contributing to an unpleasant experience.\n5. A: the sun rising - The sun rising isn't a factor that would affect the guests at a wedding reception.\n6. B: the weather - The weather at a wedding reception shouldn't cause the guests to feel under the weather, although it could provide some atmosphere.\n7. C: the dance floor - The dance floor doesn't have an impact on the guests in any meaningful way.\n8. D: a lot - A lot is a vague and unspecific amount, so this doesn't make sense in the context of affecting the reception.\n9. E: so much - So much doesn't refer to an actual amount but to an extent or degree of something.\n10. F: a little - The guests' health isn't the issue, so 'a little' doesn't seem apt.\n11. G: some - Similar to F: It is not meant to represent an amount or any form of specificity. It's a vague and ambiguous way of describing things.\n12. Therefore, D: a lot makes the most sense, as it provides a specific quantity/amount to the situation. So D: A LOT might describe the amount of guests feeling", "answer": " 44"}
{"text": "hand, is typically a small location with two or three different stores, typically in a single parking lot. This can potentially accommodate a dental office, candy store, and fast food place, as the area is not as crowded as an urban area.

Choices:  healthy workers A: safety B: accuracy C: work E: time\nOutput: 1) We understand that the context of the question talks about being able to perform a procedure.\n2. We look at the choices, which are safety, accuracy, work, time, and A) healthy workers.\n3. Choices A and B) safety and accuracy) are directly related to being able to perform the entire procedure without any risks or errors. \n4. The remaining choices are irrelevant to the question because they do not indicate what would be important while performing the procedure.\n5. So, the final choice becomes option C) work or E) time, as they both signify the ability to perform a procedure. \n6. Hence, the correct choice is  C) WORK. A worker not able to perform procedure will lead to work inefficiency because of time loss and effort.\nSo, the final answer is A) WORK\n\nInput: The ____ were the ones who lived in the area who weren't ready to move out for the new development.

So the one who live in that area should come under category C) poor or D) Natives and all other three will be eliminated.\n4) \"not ready\" should be opposite of moving out.\n5) Now, we have to identify the best which describes opposite from Moving out \"Ready\". So \"not\" will be the best candidate.\n6) \"Moving out\" is the answer and the final candidate. So the final answer", "answer": " 21"}

Choices: \tA: red B: black C: white D: yellow E: purple\nOutput: 1\nThe question asks us to select the most likely color for a 1968 convertible car. \n2. The question states that the car is a convertible. Convertibles are designed to allow a car's roof to be folded back so that the driver and passengers can enjoy riding with open top.\n3. 1968 is the year of production that the question implies, making this a late 60s car.\n4. The choices range between red, white, yellow, and black. For example, a 1967 Dodge convertible was available in colors like gold, green, and royal blue.\n5. However, a more accurate depiction of what a 1965 Chevrolet Convertible would be like in color is black or white with some variations depending on the model.\n6. When choosing the choice that best represents what is the most likely color, we determine whether we assume a convertible car to be a specific  color, or a color in general.\n7. Considering the choices, red (a primary color) is the most likely color in general for a convertible car.\n8. Red is also more likely a common choice as well since it is more likely than yellow or purple.\n9. Hence, the correct option is red; any other color selection would be the choice of specific cars, not a color that would fit the category of all convertible cars, making choice E (yellow) a wrong answer.\nSo the correct and final answer is B: red. We can select choice B due to the fact that it is the most likely color overall for a convertible car in the 1960\u2019s.", "answer": " 295"}

Choices: 0 A: love job 1 B: job 2 C: money 3 D: satisfaction 4 E: salary\nOutput: 1) The question asks to assess one's attitude toward the job, rather than one's motivation or ability to do the job satisfactorily.\n2) This means that the 'best' answer, out of all the given options, should be the one that is most closely associated with the word 'attitude'.\n3) The given answers do not contain any reference to the word 'love', which is necessary to 'love your job' as per the context. \n4) Option A: \"love job\" is not an accurate expression for one's attitude towards one's job.\n5) Option B: \"job\" can refer to the actual profession or job itself. The use of the word \u2018best\u2019 in the question implies that it is looking for a word that defines a specific feeling or attitude towards your role, as opposed to any other word that describes the job itself.\n6) Option C: \"money\" is related to the salary of the job but does not imply any attitude about it.\n7) Option D: \"satisfaction is not always expressed with the word \"love\", as per the context. You may like or appreciate your job, but not necessarily love it.\n8) Therefore the best possible answer that fits the context is option E: \"salary\".\n9) This is because, in the context given, salary refers to the pay one receives for the job they did, not the job itself.\nSo the final result would be E: salary\n\nInput: There is going to be a party at what kind of place?

{"text": "hand, is a special type of shopping mall that houses multiple boutique stores as well as restaurants, but again it is unlikely for a dental office, candy store, and fast food place to coexist in the same spot because each of the three businesses caters to different shoppers with different budgets and interests. So option D: strip mall is also incorrect.\n7. Thus, the only answer that makes sense is Option E: Urban area The question specifically asks for \"at the what\" meaning the location where these three businesses can be found. And since urban areas contain many businesses, there is a good chance that you can find a dental office, fast-food place and a candy store all in the same shopping hub--which makes 'urban area' the obvious choice. \nSo the final answer and hence, the correct one is option E: Urban area.\n\nInput: What doesn't have to be broken to be repaired? Choices: 1. A: a brick 2. B: a carpet 3. C: a door 4. D: a piano 5. E: a clock\nOutput: 1.) The sentence states that something does not have to be broken to need or require repair. This is to say things do not have to be broken in order to need to be fixed/improved. \n2.) We use the context to eliminate options A, C, and D, which describe things that can be repaired once broken. Option A pertains to bricks, which are things that have to be broken in most scenarios in order to improve them or repair them. Similarly, Option C and D are also unlikely candidates to be the answer since they describe objects such as doors and pianos that require breaks in order to be repaired.\n3.) After we eliminated 3 options, we are left with two choices, E and F, which describe things that need to be improved. We cannot pick E \"a clock\", since it is not mentioned in context to be broken, so, CLOCK can be eliminated on its own. \n4.) So now we are left with only one answer, F, which stands for floor. This is the correct answer. \nSo the Final answer is F.\n\nInput: Which has more parts, 36 or 37? Choices: A: 36 B:", "answer": " 54"}

Choices:  Tollbooth  Airport A: school B: grocery store C: job D: hotel E. restaurant\nOutput: 1 The question asks about where you would be required to fill out forms with your employment information.\n2. This assumes that employment information refers to work history, job title, pay, and other things required to work in a company.\n3. All the choices, except option E, are places where people work, and it seems unlikely that a person would go to a restaurant, hotel, airport, or tollbooth to get a job.\n4. Airport, hotel, and restaurant are also not where you will be required to fill out an employment form.\n5. The only place that requires an employment form is a job interview, and the question says that you \"would be required\", which can't be the hotel or the tollbooth or the restaurant.\n6. Hence, B: grocery stores is the answer. It is indeed a place where one would be interviewed for a job and it also requires one to fill out an employer information form.\nSo the final answers is B: grocery\n\nInput: A: 100 B: 15 C: 5 D: 0 E: 50  What is five plus twenty?

Choices:  B: constipation  C: lack of appetite  D: no food poisoning  E: no food allergy\nOutput: 1) The student ate 'an apple a day when school is in session'. This is an indication that the student was eating a lot of apples during school to the point of having an average of 'one apple per day'.\n2) This can cause multiple health consequences, and it is apparent that there needs to be a cause other than food poisoning or food allergies as they are already excluded.\n3. This leaves two answers that may have the potential cause of the student's symptoms, which are: constipation or lack of appetite.\n4. While lack of appetite is a possibility, it is unlikely to cause multiple symptoms and a clear cause. Constipation, on the other hand can induce numerous side effects.\n5. Therefore, option C, lack of appetite, can be eliminated as a possible cause\n6. Option D, food poisoning, is eliminated as the student never ate apple products which was the focus\n7. In the end, E, constipation, is the final answer as it presents as the closest viable option. It can cause similar consequences that are presented by the student.\nSo the correct final answer is E: constipation\n\nInput: I was eating a bagel and drinking water when I heard a news channel tell about a new virus.

Choice:  A. make lesson plans B. put up a poster C. teach pupils D. group students E. divide knowledge\nOutput: 1: We need to identify a situation where students don't have to work together.\n\n2: This implies that the teacher must have students work on projects together.\n\n3. If the teacher doesn't have to have students work together, the teacher may not have to group/divide students in the first place.\n\n4. And if the teacher didn't need to teach students lesson plans, the teacher may not need to prepare them for working with others on projects.\n\n5. Also, if the teacher didn'y need to work up a poster/flyer/advertisement or teach students, the teacher would presumably be teaching pupils, not teaching them about the activity.\n6. Therefore, the most correct choice out of the lot is E: divide knowledge. The teacher's role is to make sure that students do their best work.\nSo the final selection is E: divide knowledge\n\nInput: Which of these would a teacher use to divide up school work? Choices A: a list B: a chart C: a graph D: a flyer E: none of these\nOutput: 1) As per the question, the teacher is required to have students divide school work in groups.\n2.

Choice D: mother cannot be a correct answer.\ni) Mother and father can be different people, so that cannot be the answer.\nii) There are more women than men in this world, so it is reasonable to expect more people to be mothers.\n5) To the contrary, men are typically taller than women. This is because men mature slower and reach their peak height later than women and have more years to add weight to their frame. Thus, men are typically the tallest people in a household.\n6) It is also likely that a husband is the tallest person, as women are more likely to choose men who are as tall or taller than they are. This is because tall women tend to face more social issues when it comes to dating, being less competitive than shorter women on a biological level, as a guy generally tends to prefer a woman around 1-5cm taller than his height.\n7) Concluding, the options C, B and D can't be a possible answer(option C): Father, Option B: Tallest person in the household. and Option D: Mother.

Choices: 1: A: germ B: tooth C: cavity D: pain\nOutput: 1: The question is asking what a dentist typically removes from a patient's oral cavity - something that is not good to be in one's mouth, typically.\n2: There are primarily three main types of structures in the mouth: teeth, cavities, and germs.\n3: First, we can rule out teeth. The question asks about something that is removed from the patient's mouth, which can clearly refer to something inside the cavity as well as something that is removed completely. Moreover, tooth is a fixed structure and hence, it does not fit into the question.\na. Option B: germs - The word germ is a non-specific term that could refer to any bacteria, virus, or other microorganism that resides on/in the body. This is a highly general term and doesn't address something specific to the mouth. Further, they do not represent something that is removed from a person by a dentist.\nb. Option A: 'a bacteria' or 'a virus' are both specific microbe agents that reside in the mouth cavity; however, these are not directly removed by a dentist and do not directly involve dental visits.\n4: Option C: Cavity - A cavity refers to a space in a tooth that has bacteria or other structures inside. Sometimes, the cavity is removed with a drill. In certain cases, the cavity contains nerves and can be painful, and during such visits to a dentist, the dentist might extract the toothing that has cavities in it.\n5.

A school bus goes down this one-block street every morning to pick up children to take them to school.  Which of the following could the city do instead? Choices:  a. Provide a new road to the people who live there to use  b. Provide a road to the city that owns the old road  c. Destroy the building where the people live because of the loud noises the buses make  d. Stop running school buses in their street  e. Replace the buses with electric cars f. Replace the buses for a different kind of public transportation\nOutput: 1) The common problem stated by the question clearly involves the sale of old roads to another city.\n2) The city could provide a new road to the area where the street was situated, which would mean giving up or selling the road to the people who lived there. (a)\n3) The city could also provide a road to the city which owned the old road, which would involve giving it to the city who owned the old road, rather than keeping it for future use. (b)\n4) The city could also destroy the building where people live in order to reduce construction noise caused by the buses. (c)\n5) The city could stop running school buses in that street.

Choices: 1. Excellent GPA 2. Excellent grades 3. Perfect attendance 4. A degree 5. A certificate\nOutput: 1st. \"Excellent GPA\" does indicate a good job, since good marks, excellent grades, and attendance are usually required for a high GPA. 2nd. \"Excellent grades\" doesn't indicate if the candidate has a good job. It simply means that the candidate might have good grades but their attendance in a college could have been poor or their degree was obtained by just taking courses and taking exams and doesn't involve doing any work or hands-on training.\n3rd. \"Perfect attendance\" doesn't indicate good performance. An employee with perfect attendance at work doesn\u2019t imply they are qualified for the job. Many people can just avoid going to work and come the next day and show up. 4th. \"A degree\", even a perfect attendance isn't indicative of a good candidate. It's an arbitrary degree that is no guarantee for good performance for a student doesn't do any work.\n5th. \"A certificate\", only indicates what the student has received. It does not guarantee anything more.\nSo the correct answer is option 5, which states a \"certificate.\"\n\nInput: What is the opposite of a large number? Choices: 2. Low 3. High 4. Small 5.

Choices:  a door, a window, a table, a window with two tables\nOutput: 1 It's important to notice that the question isn't asking what has a 0% Probability of Existence, but instead it's asking about what item has an NON-zero Probability of Existing. This indicates that the only item with an NON-zero probability of Existence is a Window.\n2. For example, if a Table were to be asked about again, the answer could be that the only item with a NON-zero probability remaining would be a Window.\n3. If a Person is asked, only a Window would remain as a candidate for having a NON-Zero probability of Existence.\n4. Even if 15 different types of items in randomized order were asked, the only item with remaining chances would remain to be a Window.\n5. This means that the answer choice, option D: A Window with Two Tables, is not the correct answer because a Window does not have an NON-zero chance of Existence. The answer must be the window.\nSo the final Answer is: A Window\n\nInput: If it is the early 1960s, how did the Kennedy Family make money to afford their expensive lifestyle? Choices: A.

Who was on the beach at 10 pm during their vacation?

If this person had two children, they would also be on the beach. Hence, option A: family is ruled out. \n4) A family typically consists of parents, and at least one child, such that the two children are together. So, if we remove (subtract) option A: family, this leaves us with option B: a father, a son, and a daughter. This indicates that family refers to a father and two children, not a mother and two children, as mentioned in option B: a father.\n5) This leads us to rule out option B: a father and a son.\n6) Option C: a teenage boy and a teenage girl sounds reasonable and would fit.

The idea that a dental office could be located next to a cutesy candy shop with an outdoor patio as well as a quick stop fast food restaurant is somewhat odd. An individual dentist would not likely have space in their office for a large menu candy counter.

When evaluating the different choices, we take into consideration the popularity each sport in North American countries.\n3) We also take into account the noise produced by specific events within these sports and not a generic sound.\n4) For instance, a specific sporting event within basketball is called a \"slam dunk\", which refers to a player jumping high in the air and dropping the ball with an overhand motion through the basket, causing a loud thud.\nThis produces an incredibly loud sound, and is a common occurrence in basketball games, even among fans in the audience.\n5) When playing fencing, however, players use blunted weapons, and there is a greater emphasis on style and technique than on making a loud sound, which is why the answer is E: fencing.\n6) Baseball, on the other hand is known for its fast-paced action with a focus on strategy and tactics, and is also a fairly quiet game, which makes it inappropriate for a question related to making the greatest amount of noise.\n7) Football is primarily a violent, contact sport and it is common for the noise generated by players to be incredibly loud and intense.

Choices B: a and D: c make mention that something is cooked. This is not a requirement, hence choice B: a and D : c can be eliminated.\n4. Similarly, the term \"cookie\" is likely used for something baked, which brings us to choice A: b.\n5. Next is the question whether \"they\" were cookies or a cake or dough. This suggests something that is made with eggs, sugar, butter, etc. and if Samantha thought it was something else, she would not mention \"cake\" or a \"dough\".\n6. This leads me to conclusion that the word \"made\" is not used to express what something is, but what she was doing, which is baking.\n7. There's choice C: cake to consider. But then, Samantha wouldn't refer to her baked goods as \"cookies\" but instead call them \"cake\".\n8. Hence, out of all the options we have, only choice A: b is the answer. This option suggests someone baking because they weren't baked.\n9. This means that the answer is indeed A: b because Samantha thought that she was making baked goods, when in reality it was raw dough. The answer to this question is A: b.\nSo the final  choice is A : b\n\nInput: The city has several neighborhoods with _", "answer": " 7"}

The answer could be on Monday, Wednesday, Friday or even 'E'. The best bet would be Monday or Wednesday.\n3) 'Tuesday' is not linked with driving. Moreover, the Americans might not be driving on Tuesday, but not necessarily on 1st December or during Christmas Eve. It could be due to any other reason!\n4) 'Christmas' makes perfect sense because it is the specific day or event when Americans do not drive. The answer will be Christmas.\n5) Choice A: 'Monday' makes sense because Americans could not drive on 'Monday', but on 'Christmas', the 7th of December. This isn't a possibility given that America does not have a rule that no driving can be done on Monday and only on Christmas.\n6) Choice B: 'Wednesday' is a reasonable guess as well because Americans could not drive at Eid (15th November 2017) but on 'Christmas' when the 7th of January.\n7) Even though 'Friday' (19th December), 'Eve' (24th December), and 'Christmas' (25th December) are logical guesses, the best bet for this question is choice E: 'Christmas Eve.'\n8) The answer to this question is Christmas Eve.\n9.)

What should she know before buying it?\n\nOutput: Answer: Car mechanic might need to know how much canned gas weighs so that she can estimate how many miles she can go between refills. Canned gas should be very heavy for how much gasoline it contains.\n\nGiven that canned gas is very dense, it should contain a large volume of gasoline with a very small volume of air. This means that the amount of gasoline per unit of weight of gasoline should increase proportionally with the amount of gasoline that the can holds. This ratio of weight to volume would be reflected in the price per unit weight.\nIn other words, the total weight of gas from a can would generally be quite heavy compared to the same volume of gas from a different container and would still be less than the total weight of the can if it wasn't so dense.\nConsequently, the mechanic should understand that the less gasoline is bought per unit of weight, the more canned gas the mechanic will purchase for the same amount of money.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the below two grade math question.\nInput: There are 100 people in a village.

Options \"A\", \"C\" and \"E\" are not relevant as they are not physical activities. \n3.) As an office-related work is not suitable for remote workers, option \"B\" can be eliminated. 4.) Remote workers are unlikely to perform research as it can be sensitive or time-consuming and not suitable for remote workers. 5.) Writing jobs are generally flexible, but the need to write is not necessary for remote workers. Hence, \"D\" gets eliminated.\n6.) From the above information, it is evident that selling is a job that can be performed remotely. It is a job that involves communication with clients and does not require much physical labor. \n7.) So option \"E\" can be eliminated as it fits the criteria. \n8.) Then, since office-related work is eliminated and writing is eliminated, we can say that \"A\" and \"B\" are not the answer. \n9.)

It is only relevant to think about lawn that the farmer should cut, so we can rule out (A): a test that is based on a non-cutting grass. It's also clear that (D): type of grass may not be a way to judge if the grass is ready to cut because different types of grass may be cut at different times. We can similarly eliminate (E): daily look as this is not an effective way to check if the grass is ready.\n2, It is reasonable to assume a farm uses a weighing machine as it is a practical way to figure out how much grass there is on the farm. While it's fair to guess that a farmer could use a scale before, there is no specific requirement in which the farmer would use a plastic tray to put on the grass to estimate the weight of the lawns. (B): he tests different types would not be relevant to the above requirements.\n3, The most relevant method of determining the readiness of the grass is to test it. The only relevant option of ways to test the grass is (C): test different types, as we can test different types of grass to calculate the weight of the lava.

Looking at the answers, the first option seems to indicate going on a different route to reach the concert venue. But considering that the concert is being attended, the route taken is not significant - the ticket is. Hence, this isn't relevant.\n3. Option B: getting into another lineup - Since the point of buying the ticket is being to attend the concert, having to go into another lineup suggests missing the concert in which case this answer is no longer relevant.\n4. The remaining answers are \"change your mind\", \"ask for another seat\", and \"listen to the radio\".\n5. Change your mind - Wouldn't change your mind mean not attending the concert. It's clear that being able to change your mind is a valid option, but when we look at the context, it's obvious that this option is a negative outcome. Hence this answer is no longer valid.\n6. Thus we narrow down the options to \"ask for another seat\" and \"listen to the concert\".\n7. As discussed before, attending the concert is the main aim and 'not attending' this concert isn't a valid response.

Crime has to do with criminals committing criminal activities. It is a societal ill affecting a few people.

Choices: 1: The winner was responsible for cutting the loser's hair. 2: The loser would get a haircut\nOutput: 1: The two men were planning to play a game wherein the person who loses will have to shave their head. The winner established the conditions. Therefore, this implies that the person who loses must be given a chance to shave the winner's hair instead of their own.\n2: In terms of the structure of the sentence, \"Stakes\" is a term that is typically used to refer to the value of something that is up for grabs in an event/competition.\nThus, \"The winner chose the stakes.\" does not imply that the winner was responsible for the shave. It only indicates that the two players were discussing the conditions under which this event would be played and that the winner chose what the loser would have to do in case he/she loses.\n3: This could possibly make sense if \"Sacrifice\" is a part of the answer choices. Option 3: Sacrifice does refer to losing something of value in an exchange for something else. One can say that the loser will surrender their head in exchange for the winner's head.\n4: This could possibly make\nsense if the answer choices also included \"Haircut\" or \"Shave\" But unfortunately, these are not part of the answer choices in this question. So option 1: Shave the loser's head is not an accurate implication.\n5: This could possibly make some sense if a new word with the same meaning as \"Stakes\" was included in the answer choices.

This indicates that the school has recognized their talent.\n3) If he was talented enough to be on the school baseball team, then they would want him to work towards that goal. So, not pursuing athletics may not be an option.\n4) Given his previous statement that he will no longer go to the intended university if they don't let him play baseball, it can be inferred that it is important if not crucial for him to play the sport.\n5) The most likely reason for this would be because he would not receive the scholarship, in absence of which, he might not be able to attend that college.\n6) Among all the given answers, D: He would give up his schooling.\nSo the final choice will be D: He would give  up his schooling\n\nInput: There will be two teams.

In order for us to find this answer, we need to understand the context of the question.\n3. Considering that the answer is \"to park\", we can rule out all the other options that mean the opposite. \"To park\" doesn't mean to go faster, slower, or go, so this can rule out choices 1, 2, and D.\n4. Choice \"To park\" would logically mean that one of the options might have been to go somewhere.\n5. There are four choices that involve the word to go, \"To go faster\", \"To go slower\", \"To park\" and \"To go\". In this scenario, only one of these options can be used correctly, so we can eliminate the choices 3 and the remaining D. Because the answer \"to park\" can only meaningfully be used if the person is choosing to park the vehicle, it will not make sense if used with the word \"to go\", so we can eliminate choice 4 (to go).\n6. Now that we know we need to use the term \"To park\", we need to look that the remaining choice \"E: To go\" makes sense. However, since we know that a car cannot be used to drive somewhere, \"to go\" does not make sense here, so it is not a correct choice, so option E cannot be the answer.\nSo the final correct answer is A: To park\n\nInput: If a person has a job at the same workplace as their brother, are they co-workers?

The key word here is 'what' that implies it is an object or thing that's important. Choices A: sand, B: ice, and C: oxygen are not important for making life. Choice D: water already is present on the earth as is choice F: sun. The \"what?\" should be in reference to what is present on the earth but absent in the scenario.\n2. Next, for option B: ice to be possible one would need for it to be cold otherwise it would melt. From the question itself it is evident that the scenario takes place after the ice began to melt.\n3. For option C: oxygen to be present, it would have to come from the \"sky\" as it is the only source of oxygen in the atmosphere. It is not evident that the sky was present at that time; in fact, the first stars weren't yet born.\n4. That leaves us with choice E: wind, which means a moving air mass across an area.

I think a better way of saying that is using a square to avoid a certain amount of triangles would make the board cover in a triangular shape so we need to make sure the points don't use 16 squares to cover the board as you can use 64 squares (which is every square on the chessboard). So the maximum number of 'points' is: 1656 + 1 = 1657.\n3)\n  - The chessboard is 8*8 and it can be covered in 20 triangles with 20 equilateral triangles, each with a side of 1.\n  - 16 shapes = 20 triangles on a 8*8 board.", "answer": " 32000"}

Our question is asking about the phenomenon that happens after the water is already boiled. Then, if we want to find an answer, we must know the steps of how the water boils (beginning to end)\n2) Since we know the sequence: beginning, middle, and end, we can rule out two answers immediately.\n3) Steam is NOT the beginning stage of boiling water because in order to get steam, the water must ALREADY be boiling. Then, we need to boil away the extra water to obtain steam. Since our question is about the phenomenon that takes place after the water has already been heated to create steam, we cannot use \"steam\" as the answer.\n\n4) Likewise, \"evaporation\" is not the final answer either. Evaporation is the way out of the boiling process. It does not give us the result of boiling water, which is supposed to be the focus of this question.\n5) Condensation on the other hand is the right answer to this question.

Choices:  E: electrons F: protons\nOutput: 1 The question asks, \"What has more mass, electrons or protons?\".\n2 It is important to note that the choice options are both atoms - each the nucleus containing the protons and the electrons orbiting it.\n3 So, in an electron, you have a negative charge, one proton, and no neutrons whereas in an atom, you have a positive charge and multiple protons and neutrons.\n4 So in an atom, the proton contains almost all of its mass whereas in electrons, the mass is shared amongst many electrons that have an overall positive charge and thus are lighter than a proton and are usually more abundant than protons. \n5 Based on this information, the answer to the question is likely that the mass will be in protons, even more so than protons.  Since this is the most likely answer, we can rule out choices as follows:\n6 The question does not require that the atom is protons, as an atom can also consist of other elements. \n7 Protons' relative mass being higher than electrons in atoms is not necessarily true and thus it is unlikely that this case would occur.\n8 Therefore, the answer is expected to be electrons.\nSo the final correct answer is E: electrons. \n\nInput:(A) Danny: Did you know that you have a very good memory for facts?

But this would still be a hot time of the year, around 26-40\u2218C.\n4) The hottest time in Yemen is at the end of June or beginning of July, which means that the heat gets unbearable with the temperature ranging from 45 to 50\u2218C.\n5) End of January is cooler than October but not a time when it would be nice to be outdoors.\n6) It's not always cold outside in late September either, so travelling then may not be a bright idea.\n7) Middle October and mid October are also cooler than October, but they won't provide a nicer climate either.\n8) The coolest time to travel to Ymen, the best time to visit the country would be, mid October.\nSo the final choice is F: mid October.\n\nInput: What was the main focus of the book in Romeo and Juliet?

The glass water choice isn't really a method to start exercising. It only indicates that the person might need more water while exercising\n4: A shower is a part of a series of steps leading to exercise. But is not exercise so it does not fit in the set.\n5. Exercise should not be preceded by checking on children. This may be done after exercise as it isn't essential and also can happen at any time.\n6.

Choices:  a: child b: lovely c: innocent d: beautiful e: charming f: handsome g: appealing\nOutput: 1) The question \"Which of the following is NOT type of cute?\" implies that there are other types of cute beside the options that will be given.\n2) We start with option a: child as children often are cute, there is no contradiction of this option in the statement. Hence, it is one of 'types o' cute' and so must be included.\n3) Next, in option b: lovely, cute implies an endearingly adorable or attractive person. The option 'lovely' doesn't fit as its connotation is 'attractive', implying more mature people. So, the option 'lovely' is ruled out.\n\n4) In c: innocent, cute connotes an attractive adorable person that may be too young to be involved in serious things. Also, innocent connotes a good or honest person. It is not implied that an innocent person must be cute but it connotes a good or innocent person must be a lovely person and attractive thus, not a contradiction. Hence, the option'c' doesn't contradict anything.\n5) Option d: beautiful indicates beauty as an attribute of someone but 'cute' indicates being an attribute of a little bit of someone's look or physical appearance. A beautiful person doesn't give any connotation of cuteness. Hence, option 'd' is ruled out. \n6) Option e: charming can be a part of being cute. But it doesn't indicate the entirety of an attribute.

Choices:  T: go play tennis V: watch \nOutput: 1: We understand that this is a \"what if\" kind of question in the format of \"If <A>, then do <B>. Here's our understanding: The question is asking \"If it rained, would I go out and play tennis, or would I watch it on TV?\"\n2.

If the question was \"would I watch a Tennis match on tv?\" It would make more sense to give a TV choice - either A: Go play Tennis, or B: Watch Tennis on tv.\n4. This question is slightly different, as it asks \"If it rained...\" - the question in actual context is almost similar to asking \"If it rains what would you do?\"\n5. Hence, in context, the best answer for this question would be V, as it fits both statements A: \"If it rains, I would go out and play Tennis\" AND B: \"If it rained I would watch Tennis\"\nSo the final answer in this case would be V: to watch on tv.\n\nInput: What can you eat when cooking on a George Foreman grill?

Hence it cannot be the correct choice, as groups cannot be reduced down to one person.\n5 D: 'only one person', a group of friends cannot possibly all decide to let one person out of them pay for the meal as it would mean that each person in the group is happy to chip in and only one person would be letting go of paying.\n6 E: 'nobody', it is very important to realize that nothing about 'nobody' refers to paying for the meal.

Let's try to understand all the options more thoroughly:\n5) D: food is one of the ways to spend money but doesn't have to be a specific category of spooning money. It is possible to eat well and not spend much money, or spend a lot of money on food but it doesn't necessarily mean that all your money will go into dining. Hence D: food is ruled out as well.\n6) Next, let's evaluate option E: bills. This means expenditures on necessities, such as mortgage payments, utility bills, car payments, and health insurance.

He sometimes employed the work of other artists.  He had a reputation for employing top artists. But on occasion, he would call a painter to help him out, telling them that they were some of the very best painters around--even though the artist had no idea that he had done so.  Why did Dwayne do this? Choices:  I: He was trying to be kind, even when he didn't know if the person was any good.  II: He wanted to make the workers feel superior that someone of Dwayne's expertise was hiring.   III: He was proud of his reputation for calling top-notch painters.   IV: He made his workers look good in front of clients by telling them, even if he didn't know, that they were talented.      V: He believed that even if the painter was not very good, he would perform better once he found out Dwayne had a reputation for calling top-quality painters.\nOutput: 1) What is the purpose of a statement such as, \"you are some of the very top painters\"?\nA) To make the painters feel inferior to other employees of the painter.\nB) To indicate a sense of appreciation, admiration, and trust; the painter will probably do an impeccable job in this given situation.\nC) To be an indiscriminate statement regardless of the fact that the statement itself is not made with authority or experience.\nD) To convey the impression that the artist is above the normal artist and their work will be better than normal.\n2) The most likely reason Dwayne does this is:\nA) To convey the impression to the client that you and Dwayne are not top-notch paints, but it's nice that he thinks so and we are going to go the extra mile for him.\nB) He was being humble in his speech, and he was simply trying to make his", "answer": " 35"}

Choices:  a. miles per day b. miles per hour c. one thousand miles per day d. miles per foot e. one thousand miles per hour\nOutput: 1 - a mile a minute means that one is going a distance of one mile in one minute.\n2 - A mile is a distance, not a speed. Since a mile a minute is the time taken to cover one mile, it is not the same as miles per day, miles per hour, or one thousand miles per day. Hence, option B is incorrect\n3 - one thousand miles in an hour mean that one is traveling at the speed of one thousand miles per hour. However, a mile a minute is different. One mile in one minute implies a speed of one mile per minute.\n4 - Miles per foot is not valid. A mile is a distance and the speed at which it is covered is miles per hour. Hence option D is incorrect.\n5 - Miles per hour is not valid, given that a mile is a distance that takes a certain amount of time to cross. If we take one hour to cover a distance (say, a city block) then we have crossed one mile. Miles per hour is the speed at which a person can cover a mile. However, a mile here refers to distance and not speed. Miles per hour in this context is a red herring. Hence c is incorrect.\n6 - One thousand miles in a day is equivalent to traveling at a speed of 1,000 miles per day (which makes no sense). On the other hand, \"a mile a minute means one goes a distance of one mile per minute, which is different from 1,00 miles per day. Hence option E is incorrect.\nSo the final correct answer to \"What does \"a mile a  minute\" mean?\" is: A mile a minute means one covers a distance of one mile (in one minute).\nInput: What do the phrases, \"a day in the life", "answer": " 1080"}

It is evident that there is more than one reason here.\n2) From the four options given, it is safe to say that option A: people drive fast is not the correct answer as its seems too simple and doesn't meet what is implied in the question, i.e. higher rates per 000 peers when compared to other countries.\n3) Option B: The road system is poor indicates that there is a lack in road construction or maintenance in the U.S. as compared to other countries or we can surmise that, for some reason, there are more road accidents in The U.S when compared to other countries\n4) Option C: there aren'y rules implies that there is an absence of a law (i.e. rules) regarding road accidents thereby resulting in a high percentage of car crash rates.\n5) Option D: There are a large lot of people can be inferred as the cause of higher car crash rate in the united states. The fact that its population is one of the largest in the world, there is a higher traffic when compared to other countries with lower population and therefore there are more car crash rates.\n6) It is evident that only one of above options can be the correct answer and the others must be eliminated\n7) So, the correct answer is Option (D) There are a large lot  (or large number) of people.\nSo, the final answer is D : there are a large number of people\n\nInput: What is \"on the ground\", \"in the air\", and \"on top of a", "answer": " 5"}

Choices:  K: Jupiter C: Earth B: Pluto E: Venus F: Mars\nOutput: 1\" The question is asking about a planet that can rotate back to front.\n2. The textual clue is \"that rotates back to front\".  This implies that the planet in question must rotate backwards (ie counterclockwise).\n3. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, but it doesn't rotate back to front, therefore the answer is not A: Jupiter.\n4. Earth is the third largest planet in our solar systen. Earth does not rotate back to front. So the answer is not D: Earth.\n5. Pluto is no longer considered the planet after it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Hence it is not available as an answer in this context.\n6. Therefore, answer E is Venus. Pluto rotates back to front because it has an unusual shape. But its surface is too small to fit the context. Venus is the planet that spins back to front.\nSo the final option for this question is E: Venus.  Venus rotates in a back and forth motion. Its rotation period of the planet Venus is 243 days, and it spins in a clockwise direction.\nThis makes it the only viable option for rotating backward.\n\nInput: What type of food is not suitable in a vegetarian meal?

The correct answer in this question is one that was the first in space and then came from USSR.\n2 (B): This choice has a misspelling of the word 'Shepard', indicating that it's incorrect.\n3 (C): The phrase 'in space' has no specific reference to a spacecraft, so it is more likely that the intended answer would refer to somebody that was the first person in space on a spaceflight. \n4 (D): As both Gagarin and Shepard have been mentioned in the question as being the first human being to be in space, option D is not the intended correct answer. It seems highly unlikely that a person from USSR would be the first human in space and then be named 'Yuri' as opposed to the other two options of Gagarin and Shepherd.

Choices:  A. You must choose between two impossible options. B. What you are saying is incorrect. C. You would have no way of knowing this. D. This is just common sense. E. You are too simple minded to understand.\nOutput: 1) At first, it seems like there is an underlying implication in the question to understand what it means to 'know' that something'should' be 'obvious'. But since the question is already framed to indicate 'you should know', this assumption is not necessarily correct and the question can only be answered by directly interpreting the sentence.\n2) The first part of the sentence indicates there is a 'thinker' who thinks something'should be obvious', but instead they are choosing to express that they believe something 'is hard'. This means that the thinker has a lack of knowledge about what 'obviousness' or 'hardness' means, and if they don't know this then they would not be able to answer this question.\n3) The only choice that matches the criteria provided by the sentence is E. You are too'simple minded' to understand, which essentially means the 'thinker' in question does not understand how to think deeply and is therefore not able to understand the question in front of them. Therefore, option E: You are too simple mind is the right choice based on the given sentence.\nSo the final choice is E: You are too'simple-minded' to understand, it matches the criteria perfectly.\n\nInput: How can you get from the beach to the lake?

Choices:  B: home C: church D: hospital E: school\nOutput: 1) Option A) is rejected because it is too specific to make it the general answer. \n\n2) Option B) is rejected because it does not match the context provided by the question because a home is not an appropriate environment to see a manikin in.\n3) It is impossible for a church to have a manikin inside it unless it is specifically a church that worships manikins (unlike many churches that have saints as symbolic representations). Similarly, a hospital is not a proper environment unless it has only manikins as patients like a haunted house or a special section of a museum. \n\n4) Option D) is rejected because it gives a proper answer to an improper question. Since the question is about where might you see a mania, it is natural to assume that the answer will be in a maniac's house and that would be option D.\n5) Thus, option E) is chosen as the correct answer because manikin is a more generic word for mannequin and we have never said a manikin needs to be an anagram for man; hence it is natural to assume an ordinary home can contain one.\nSo the final choice is E: school\n\nInput: Which sport can involve all the players attacking the same goal?

A narrow river canoe is used to maneuver narrow rivers (not lakes or oceans) with a lot of twists and turns - not for travelling or trade.\n5) Since the question requires something long with a concave or curved shape, and has a name, it rules out option A: ( ) duggout canoe because it is a short, curvy canoe made from trees, not long, narrow, or shaped by carving.\n6) Option B: ( ) birchen canoe is only used", "answer": " 60"}

A raincoat is a covering that is worn over clothing, while a rain jacket acts as outerwear that is worn on top of clothing.  So the second statement is incorrect.\n3: C: a rainy can coat is worn by most people on rainy days. Hence, choice C: a rain jacket isn't required to be used alone while working in the rain.\n4: D: this describes an incorrect scenario where a person would wear a raincoat and then waterproof overalls on top of it. A raincoat covers the person and acts as a shield, while overalls are worn underneath to protect the individual from getting wet.\n5: E: Both can be worn, but not simultaneously. A raincoat would be worn without the overalls. Also, when worn with overalls, the raincoat helps protect the overalls from the rain rather than the other way around. \n6: Therefore, the answer must be either A or B.\n7: Since it isn't possible to wear either a rain jacket or raincoat with overalls, the statement that has to be correct is that the farmer wore rain boots. \n8: Hence, the answer to the question is choice B: rain boots, raincoat and raincoat alone is not suitable.\n\nInput: What\u2019s the quickest way to a restaurant located next to your boss\u2019 office at", "answer": " 10"}

His face is not only dirt but also dirty. Therefore, we are trying to see where he will go when this face is dirty.\n1. The kitchen can easily be the room where he will go because he would want to eat after a long day of playing and playing and playing. In the kitchen, he can eat and brush his teeth.\n2. The bathroom is also a likely place because in this room he can clean/wash away the dirt. He can also wash his face before going to bed.\n3. The living room is another option because he can clean the floor and sit with his family while eating.\n4. The bedroom is unlikely as he may not feel like doing much cleaning up.\n5.

Choices:  B: parents C: children D: teenagers E: adults F: grandparents\nOutput: 1 and 2. The phrase 'Who would not give money to' implies that the answer is one of the five options given, which includes 'parents, children, teenagers, adults, and grandparents'. Since parents and children would be expected to give money to a beggar outside their doorstep, the correct answer is most likely to be the opposite -- 'adults and grandparents'.\n3. If the homeless person is standing close to the door of their home, their parents and children would not likely be outside or around, making it an inconvenience to hand them money. Hence, the answer has to be 'adults and/or grandparents'.\n\nInput: Why would most Americans be interested in the French Revolution?  Choices:  A. It happened near their country B: Its in their history book C: It is not their history at all D: Its their favorite period E: They dont like people\nOutput: 2. The phrase, 'Why would most Americans be interested....?', implies that the answer could be any of the five choices given. However, since the question mentions that Americans are the ones who would be particularly interested in the French Revolution, the right answer has to be the 'favorite period' as it seems to be the least likely choice, meaning that it must be the correct answer. This is because if we assume that most Americans studied their history books, some would surely be interested in their country's neighbor's. \nMoreover, the phrase 'Its their favorite period' implies that they are interested in this period as a whole, and not only its events. \n3. If they are interested in its events, they must be aware of its history. Hence, the answer cannot be C: Not their history at all. \nFurthermore, the", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "hand, is a type of shopping area that contains smaller and independent businesses that are typically located in the same neighborhood.\n7. A dental office and a candy store next to a fast food location seems to fit the description of a strip mall. Option D: strip mall is the correct answer.\nSo the final result is D: strip mall. A strip mall is a type of shoebox that contains smaller and independent stores. One of the typical stores that reside in the strip mall is a dental office. The strip mall is most suitable as the answer because it has a special characteristic that is fitting to this situation. The strip mall that could house the dental office and candy store is an independent store, which is a smaller building that is owned privately and is often located in a residential or commercial neighborhood.\nThe dentist's office and the fast food caf\u00e9 are not in the same type of location. They belong to different types of businesses.\nThe strip malls can attract people from the whole city and the rural neighborhood to visit it. It is the perfect location for the candy store and the dentist's office. The two businesses together can create a strong community, and the fast food cafeteria can enhance the sense of place.\nYou are helping a friend move out of the city.  What can you do?

That is why, it must mean that you are planning to help your friend move out of the town. That's why it is not be helpful, quit giving up, and quit giving up and find other friend.\n2) That makes it either give up and move away or give up and move in to city. \n3) The following options tell you that you cannot help your friend at all and you are willing to give your friend some money that he needs for moving away from the city.\n\n4) The given answer makes sense because now in the remaining part of the paragraph you are given a reason why did you help your friend and what did you actually help him to do", "answer": " 6"}

Choices:  Precipitation B: sunny, cloudy C: warm, cold D: wind E: heavy rain\nOutput: 10. The weather forecast refers to information about future weather conditions, including temperature, precipitation, and wind.\n2 Precipitation indicates rain or other forms of precipitation, such as sleet or snow. In March in Paris, France, it is likely that precipitation will be present in some form most days during the month. Therefore, option A: Precipitation is the correct answer. \n3 During this time in Paris, France, the weather could range from a full day of sunshine with a high temperature of about 61\u00b0F (cloudy day) to a full day of rain with a high temperature of around 59\u00b0F (very heavy rain). Therefore, option B: sunny, cold, and option C: warm, cold are incorrect answers as those would indicate two different sets of predictions with no match. \n4 As for option D: wind, since it is highly variable, it can be true that there will be wind one day and not the next. But overall, wind is a variable factor, so it is not necessary to consider when deciding the forecast, and thus option D: wind cannot be the right answer.\n5 Option 5: E: Heavy rain, would indicate continuous precipitation throughout a day, but for option E: Heavy rain to apply, it would have to occur the entire day of the day on which the Parisian is traveling (i.e. it would only be applicable for one of March 3, 4, and 5).", "answer": " 216"}

However, in some states, it is common to have pizza on the menu as an example in a Wisconsin hot dog stand, you would expect to find some kind of cheese-covered bread.\n5) Burgers would be a much safer bet. Every state produces at least a few versions of the humble hamburger, so you\u2019ll be sure to find a local favorite among the offerings.\n6) Pizzas in Wisconsin will likely be made of potato crust rather than the more commonly found cheese-covered dough (the more traditional kind of pizza).\n7) Lastly, turkeys are often a big part of many dishes, and you\u2019ll be able to see plenty of them when you travel to E. So, the final answer to the question will be B: Hawaiians\nSo the final answer will be B: Hawaiian.\n\nInput: Will there be a fight between the people in group A or choice A: A or C: C.

It is unlikely to get to a spam/junk folder because 'junk mail' is a type of email that contains advertisements, solicitations, and fraudulent messages.\n2. A phishing scam is a specific type of fraud that uses email to lure personal information. It would not go to a'spa' folder. It would likely go to the inbox if such an email is marked as legitimate.\n3. A legitimate business email is likely to go to the inbox because it is authentic.\n4. A business email is likely to be sent to the inbox because email from a real business is likely to be legitimate.\n5.

We're not aware of other options to describe our behavior. Choice E: stay in line is a common choice that people might make. However, it also depends on how good the restaurant is--to take the chance that the next diners will be better.\n5) So, the correct answer is likely to be: move closer to kitchen (B) which does not require that much time to reach its full impact.\nSo the final answaer is B: move closer to kitchen\n\nInput: What makes someone a successful artist?

However, if a book has no date on it, it can be considered fiction, if any of the following conditions do not apply.\n2) The author of the book has to be mentioned on the cover, because with fiction, it is not necessary that the book has an author.\n3) In fiction books, there will be a lot of action scenes and description is required to make readers feel as if they are a part of the story.\n4) While a lot of the books are unique as they are the creator's original work, they may also be a part of a series.\n5) In fiction, there is generally no need for chapters to be included in the books.\n6) Finally, each of the choice does not fit the case.

It can be done by looking at the phrasing of \"the world's 1 centenarians\" and understanding that it means that the chosen actors were aged over 100.\n2a. Now that the age group is known, it can be easier to identify potential sources for the information related to each of the actors, such as where they reside and are born.\n3a.

However, not all of them can be considered \"most important\", given that a book is a whole - you shouldn't judge it on the quality of its pictures or plot.\n3.

D: I was running late and I was going to be late. E: I was in the shower shampooing my hair.\nOutput: 1) The text from the question starts with, 'What might a student write in an English assignment?' This immediately tells us the type of assignment involved.\n2) An English assignment is typically a creative writing exercise, where students are encouraged to express themselves freely and to use their imaginations to come up with creative and engaging stories.\n3) Based on this information, we can rule out options that do not suit this type of assignment, such as 'I was feeling good so I ha a salmon lunch' which involves no creativity and makes no sense, and 'I was in the shower' which is just an unrelated sentence that has nothing to do with the assignment.\n4) Thus, we can eliminate options A: I was sitting in the coffee shop and sipping  a  fresh latte, B: I was going  for  a stroll  across  the park, C: I was feeling  good  so I  had  a  salmon   lunch  with  a  friend   of  mine, and  D:  I  was  running   late  and I  was  going to be late.\n5) Out of the remaining options, option A: I was sitting  in a coffee shop and  sipping a fresh  latte, sounds the most creative and engaging, and involves a good amount of imagination.

D\n6: E is also incorrect because the question says \"the professor's notes included\", while the professor's speaker notes included the graphics and the color schemes, but the audience's speaker notes do not have to or need to use graphics and color schema. So E should also be eliminated.\n7: B is correct because the question talks of incorporation of the audience's visuals into the lecture, and incorporation is usually done by including these visuals in the speaker's notes.

Choices: A: two full days B: ten hours C: two weeks  D: two years E: more \nOutput: 1) For an extended period of time means that it requires an employee to work for a long duration for the company.\n2) The correct sentence format is: The company provided an ________ for those who wanted to work for an extended period of\ntime.\n3) As an incentive, the company is rewarding those who will be working for a long time. Therefore option C: two weeks  is not the correct answer\n4) The company will be providing a long work-period incentive to those that would want to work for them. An incentive is a form of reward. So, if the incentive is long, the work-period would be the same so option D: two years  is not the correct choice.\n5) The company is only giving incentives to those who are working for an extended period of work.

A: president: This choice is in accordance with the question statement because a police force is led or directed by a president whose job it is to help his or her country\u2019s citizens.\n3. B: Lawyers: The job of a lawyer is to represent individuals who have legal troubles or disputes. They can also help citizens with civil rights matters and immigration issues.\n4. C: police: the police are experts in law enforcement\n5. D: Soldiers: The job of soldiers is to protect their country from external threats so this choice definitely fits the question.\n6.

A: The bridge was built of wood and thus rotten and drier can be a possible reason for it falling apart. \n4. B: The people lived over the river do not really have any bearing on the bridge falling apart. A flood could happen over the river, which can damage the old wooden bridge. But the flood would have done so regardless of who lived over the river. Therefore, this is not a good fit.\n5. C and D: Similar to B, these too do not say that the people left over the river.

Hence Caf\u00e9 (choice 1) is not an appropriate answer for the question.\n3) The question is vague and does not clearly indicate the work Einstein was involved with. It is possible that Einstein may have worked as a postal employee at some point in his life, but this does not appear to fit the context provided in the question.\n4-5) Movie theaters and libraries are not generally seen as places for working in physics research. Cinema (choice 4) and Library (choice 5) won't be the correct answer. Choices 4 and 5 both are dismissed.\n6) The question states that Einstein worked at a military academy. This implies that he was employed in some capacity by the military, whether as a researcher or instructor. According to the given context, the answer would be Military academy.

So, a strip mall is most likely to contain these kinds of businesses next to each other than a medical building, a hospital, a school, or an urban area. Hence, option D: strip mall might possibly be the answer.\nHowever, an issue with it lies in the description of what the building is called. The question asked a \"strip mall\" and we just need to know what a dental office, candy store, and fast food place would be called in that building. In reality, a \"strip mall\", like any other building, could have different names. Since that is not the focus of the question, it becomes unnecessary to identify the name of building based on the name(s) of the store(s).\n7. Thus, based on our information so far, all that we need to know now is that the strip mall, or any other building with these businesses might possibly be, contains a building that the question is asking about. Hence, the answer boils to B: hospital. A hospital is a building that could house a dental office next to candy store and fast-food place.\nSo the final Answer is B: hospital\n\nInput: When the sun shines, its heat is a good thing.

Choices:  H: the last A: any that would not fight B: only the biggest and strongest C: the food it wants D: whatever it could find E: just enough so the animal would survive\nOutput: 1: The question requires us to identify who would an animal in the wilderness eat when it had no other food in the area. \n2. Option A: 'ANY that would not fight' would imply that the animal would prefer any of the food it could get and it's not necessarily a matter of the size and strength of the animal.\n3. Option B: Only the biggest and strongest. This option implies that the animal would eat the biggest and strongest, and we can eliminate it as a possibility. \n4. Option C: The food the animal wants is the one of the available food which is being the last on the list.\n5. Option D: We can eliminate the food it could get, as it doesn't make sense to refer to the food in a general sense, and is only available when the animal can find it.\n6. From above, only option E: 'Just enough' is the correct choice as we can't know the animal's size, strength or desirability. The animal could take whatever it could find and that is enough for it to eat, thus choosing this option as the correct choice.\nSo the final choicce is E: 'Just ENOUGH'\n\nInput: Which of the words is not part of a song title by Van Morrison?

Pink dots are not a popular name for this type of thing in the United States. The correct answer must be a unique answer that is not one that already exists for this particular category.\n5.) A ''pink car'' is not really correct, because you would only call it ''a pink car'' if it is a car painted that particular color.\n6.) A pink flag is more of a designator for special attention than a specific thing.\n7.) A ''pink flag'' would be a flag with the color pink in it. \n8.) ''Pink flags'' are more of a warning indicator or a way to label something.\n9.) The only answer that can be considered is ''pink pants''.\n10.)

Yet, as we look at the question a little more closely, we see that this business combination isn't random at all as there could be a connection between a dentist and a candy store, one of which might belong to the same person, or they could be the same business.

Therefore, a question that doesn't ask about price cannot have such an option.\n5) Option e: specialty store can be excluded because no stores of such nature operate in a small town in the real world.\n\n6) Therefore, option a: grocery stores is most likely to be the right answer. And in fact, it is the right answer.\n\ninput:\"Is a 3 or an even number an integer\" Choices: a: True b: False c: Integer\nOutput: 1: The question asks about a number, namely \u20183\u2019 or \u2018even number\u2019.

Choices:  B: ice C: warm D: coffee E: water\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking about an item that can be used to provide warmth, relief from the cold.\n2. The choices include: B: ice, C: warm, D: coffee, and E: water.\n3. Ice is simply a way to make one's drink colder and does not provide for warmth.\n4. Warm, which is described as \"pleasant and comfortable, being hotter than most surrounding things,\" cannot truly be used to describe any inanimate object.\n5. Coffee is a warm drink but coffee does not provide warmth, nor does it make one's body warm.\n6. Water is simply a liquid that can be drunk and does not provide for any warmth or comforting relief from the cold. So only the choice E: water can really be considered, since it would only be a viable choice if the wording were: \"What can you use on your body in order to be warm?\"\n7. The correct answer is choice E: water, since only water provides for warming of the body and also cooling down if one desires such.\nSo the final conclusion is E: water.\n\nInput: Why is rain sometimes helpful?

Choices: \nA: loose spark plugs B: stuck pistons C: bad battery D: broken cylinders E: faulty alternator\nOutput: 1) The question demands us to identify a situation that is \"unusual and improbable\" and is therefore \"most\" likely to cause a car to lose its acceleration.\n2) In order to understand the problem statement, we need to understand car engines and the systems within them.\n3) An automobile engine contains a series of moving components like pistons, cylinders, spark plugs and ignition systems.\n4) Cars derive their acceleration from the energy provided by the combustion of fuel in the engine and from the power that is generated from the combustion process.\n5) The combustion process requires a combustion chamber present inside each of the engine\u2019s multiple cylinders. Spark plugs within these cylinders initiate the reaction between the oxygen present in the air and the fuel through an electrical current. \n6) If spark plugs fail to provide electrical current to the spark plugs inside the cylinders or if they fail to work properly, the pistons and cylinders lose their power to function effectively, thereby causing the car\u2019s acceleration to decrease or lose power.\n7) Hence, if a car's spark plugs are faulty or have loose connections, then the car can lose acceleration. \n8) Since the fault lies in the car's electrical system, it wouldn't be wise to dismiss choices B and E as they may be useful later in the process.\n9) Choices A, B and E are all technical and specific answers relating to a car's engine and how certain issues or defects in its electrical system cause it to lose acceleration", "answer": " 34560"}

'Say 'Hi' and smile, but be professional.' 'Try to be professional but stay as friendly as you can be at the same time.' 'Don't try to get too friendly.' 'Make your presence known.'\nOutput: 1.'Try to be as friendly' - This advice is not the best for the employee. It implies that it is okay to be friendly to colleagues but not necessarily to the manager. This could lead to potential conflicts in the workplace.\n2.'Say 'Hi' & smile, but be professional' - It doesn't seem relevant, as an employee shouldn't only care about interacting with the manager.\n3.'Try to be professional but at the same time, be friendly' - It contradicts the first advice given. This implies that the employee should try to be friendly but at the same time be professional.\n4.'Don't trying to be too friendly' - It is not recommended to be overly friendly at work, which might be misconstrued as being flirtatious.\n5. 'Make Presence known' - It is important for an employee to establish themselves within the workplace by introducing themselves to their coworkers and being visible, but being friendly and professional should be a priority.\n6. Thus the correct answer is 'Make your presence known'.

The given phrase \"went into an ocean\" further indicates that the cave has an opening that leads to water. Together, these clues point to an underwater cave that leads to the ocean.\n4) So, the answer should be B: 20ft.\n5) Now, if we look at the remaining choices, it is unlikely that the opening of the cave is at 42 feet or 43 feet as that would be outside the water and the ocean. So, the answers should be F: 43ft or E: 42ft.\n6) However, the choice F: 43feet is not accepted because the given phrase \"20 feet below the water's surface\" indicates that the cave is less than 20ft (18ft, 19ft) below the water, so, the answer seems be E2: 42ft, which is the depth at which the cave led to the ocean.\nSo the final solution is E: 42 ft\n\nInput: People used to go on safari, taking a dangerous expedition into a vast wilderness.

AI can have a mind and it can get a better one in a similar way to how humans can get a better one or a person can get a smartphone. We can think, learn, or adapt in a similar way to a computer.\n2. AI is not a mind nor can it get a mind. We can adapt in ways that are useful like how a computer can learn.\n3. Human minds can give computers minds that can do anything that a human mind can do.\n4. We can adapt in a different way from a computer.\n5. We can adapt by using our brains.\n6. AI can become very smart by learning what we know.\n\" Output: 1. AI can't really have a mind because the term'mind' does not indicate it. Thus option A is wrong.\n2. A similar way of adapting for AI and humans is incorrect because humans are much more complex and sophisticated, and their adaptive abilities aren't similar at all.\n3. Having a mind is such a thing that only humans have, not AI. Thus this is also wrong.\n4. We're no way more different than computers in our adaptive abilities, and this answer is also wrong.\n5. AI can's adapt, because it is a completely different thing.\n6. We can't make AI become very smart, because it cannot learn what we know. So, this is wrong.\n7. As per the sentence, humans can use their minds, but AI cannot. Thus, the answer is C - humans can, AI can't. However, no other answer is completely right. So the final answer is this whole sentence.\nSo the final solution is: humans can, AIs can't use their minds\n\nInput: People have a wide range of emotions.

Although it may seem intuitive that Presidents and Congressmen are physically together, they don't stay in the same place at any one time for a variety of reasons. 3. First, presidents and Congress don't stay in proximity at any given time due to the large geographical distances between the country's primary locations. 4. It's not easy to imagine a scenario where Presidents and Congressmen physically coexist at any point given the vast distance between Washington, DC, and many of the states, along with the distance between the two bodies of government. 5. Second, it's not always possible for Presidents and Congressmen to physically meet with each other due to complex logistics and security concerns. 6. Third, Congress has been designed to function in a completely separate way from the White House and it's not always conducive for Congress to be physically around the Executive Branch. This is due to its unique set of procedures. 7. Because Congress is a legislative body, it's separate from Executive Branch as it deals with laws that are passed through deliberation and voted on by elected members of Congress, who represent their local areas.\n8.

They didn't win many matches. The coach didn't like Rashida. They didn't appreciate the work she did for them. \nShe needed to try harder. Which of these is true? Choices:  Only b and d\nOutput: One important thing to note in the question is that Rashida joined the team and helped by doing many types of jobs, such as organizing the equipment.  This indicates that the soccer team she belonged to needed more help than they were receiving - either from Rashida herself or from someone on the team.\n2. Option A: \"This was a bad one. It didn't win many games\" does not address the question directly. If they were a bad team, it does not matter whether they won or lost matches - either way suggests that they would need more help in terms of organization.\n3. Option B: \"The coach didn't like her\" - even if there was a rift between Rashida and the coach, it doesn't indicate that the team as a whole had difficulty organizing or managing their equipment. 4. Option C: \"They didn't appreciate the help she provided\" is not a true statement if Rashida was being helpful. \n5. Option D: \"She needed to try harder\" seems like an appropriate choice - It indicates that Rashida was making an effort to be helpful.\n6.

When there are multiple independent clauses in one sentence, they are often separated by a coordinating conjunction (and, or, but, nor, for, so). In this case, a semicolon can be used to separate the two independent clauses and the coordinating conjunction that connects them.\n2.3)  Some examples are:\n\nOutput:  A semicolon can be confused with a comma \u2013 but there is a difference.\nA comma is usually used to separate a subordinate clause from a main clause (or coordinate clauses).\nA semicolon indicates a stronger connection between words or clauses and is used to separate two independent clauses.\nHence, the choice that matches the statement given to use semicolon is \"c. never\", as it is clear that semicolon should not be used in the end of a sentence before a conjunction.\n\nInput: If you are in a rowing boat, how much time will it take you to row", "answer": " 31"}

Option A: \"playing basketball\" makes no mention of the daughter's age or any possible interest in athletics, even though the phrase \"on the TV\" implies that she might be watching sports on television.\n2. Option B: \"watching TV\" - This may be something the daughter watches, however, it is not necessarily something that she participates in. Watching a sport on TV does not necessarily make one an athlete. Moreover, the daughter\u2019s interests in sports are not explicitly mentioned in the text, so we cannot assume that she is into athletics.\n3. Option C: \"running track\" seems consistent with the phrase \"on the field\" used to describe what the daughter is watching, as it can be assumed that the daughter is watching a track-and-field event such as a relay race. However, the description of her mother as a \"good role model\" and the daughter\u2019s interest in sports suggest that this option is not appropriate.\n4.

Choices:  a: when it is vacant   b: during the peak season   c: before Christmas   d: when the workday begins   e: during the after-business hours\nOutput: 1: The answer is b: during the peak of the season. A job needs someone to fill it. It would only make sense to find this person during the peak season (i.e. the busiest time, typically in summer), because that would increase their chance of getting hired.\n2. Therefore, choice c: before Christmas is not correct because Christmas time may not be the peak season for these companies.\n3. Choice a: when it is unoccupied does not make sense as jobs typically don't go vacant. It's important to find someone to keep those positions filled.\n4. Choice d: when the work day starts does not make sense, because it does not take into account vacant jobs or peak time.\n5.

So the answer to this problem is that it is at night.\n2) Day & Night are two words that are often misunderstood or misused. Day actually is the span of time during the daytime, just as night is the span of time that is the night. For instance, the day is typically considered to be from sunrise to sunset. At night time, the sun is low in sky and gives off moon like glow, thus, the night is from sunset to sunrise.\n3) At twilight, the sun is starting its descent from the eastern horizon to the western horizon (also called the Sun setting).\n4) In the morning and evening the sun goes through a twilight period when it can cast a shadow in the same direction in which the sun will rise or set but cannot produce a shadow (due to the sun\u2019s weak rays) so the shadows are visible.\n5) If the Sun is shining brightly, i.e. it is a clear day then it is called daytime.

Choices: \tA: London B: New York City C: Hong Kong D: Los Angeles E: Tokyo \nOutput: 1) The question is asking about what city has two main shopping districts. Let us understand each choice in reference to this.\n2) A: London - The choice A: London is unlikely in the question with the answer to this question. It is likely not a big city where there are multiple shopping districts. It is probably a residential town that does not have too many shopping complexes. There seems to be more than two areas, too, which is inconsistent. Moreover, London is not a common name used to explain a certain city. So, A: London is not the answer to our question.\n3) B: New York City - is ruled out because there are at least seven shopping districts in New York City alone. (And there are plenty of smaller ones) Additionally, according to Google Maps, you can find a minimum of seven shopping districts/complexes within the central business district of New York City. This is probably too many shops compared to 2.\n4) C: Hong Kong - Hong Kong seems to be too small to host to two shopping districts.\n5) D: Los Angeles - Los Angeles is not a common name that is used to describe a city. In addition, the number of shopping districts in Los Angeles are not only three, but this is also the case across different shopping districts in Los Angles.\n6) London is neither the answer with a likely answer or one that satisfies the restrictions in the question.\n7) Finally, in E: Tokyo.

E: Go over the game plan with her team.\nOutput: 1: The question is asking for a strategy that Cynthia could implement to ensure a successful team-building experience before the upcoming sporting event.\n2. The activity should serve multiple purposes: building a sense of camaraderie among team members, creating excitement and anticipation for the event, and getting players and parents to commit to attending.\n3. It is clear that planning a pre-game past bar is focused on food and does not include an opportunity to bond with parents. \n4. The choice B talks about parents, fans, and town which shows that it is about getting parents together and not the players.\n5. The choice E talks about the game plan and not team members which shows that it is too specific to player experience and not about building parent community.\n6. Choices A & C do not mention any of the activities that Cynthia can do. Thus they are not the correct choices.\n7. Choice D talks about food, which shows that it is a food-related act.\n8. There is an opportunity to discuss the game with players and parents.

Hence, eliminating the options that DO provide a pay raise but DO include overtime can be done as follows:   (A) Job with low pay and (C) Job with high pay both include overtime.\n5.

Choices:  B: Many C: One D: Nine E: Three\nOutput: 1) First we consider the word \"kinds\" and we notice that the question is not referring to species of the birds, instead, it refers to how many bird species there are indigenous to China. \n2. Now, \"kinds\" is an ambiguous word that can also refer to types. We need to determine which of the two meanings it has in the sentence.\n3.

Hence, option B: pins is ruled out. \n3) Since all a scissor can do is cut, it isn\u2019t the suitable tool to keep tights together.

As there is only one \"A\" so \"A\" must be the answer.\n2) There is a space after question mark, and no space was given for a new letter. So \"A\" is still answer.\n3) There is a space before the first \"A\", so a space for new letter was given. So \"A\" and \"B\" can be two answers.\n4) If you take away the letters \"A\", then there is a space for letter \"B\", which also can be an answer. \n5) If you take away both letters \"A\" and \"C\", there is a space for a new letter, which also can be an answe.\n6) But there is a problem. If both letters \"A\" \"C\" are taken away, then question mark will be gone too.\nSo if both letters \"A\" or \"C\" are taken, \"Question mark\" can only go before the space where letters \"B\", \"F\". \n7) Because \"B\" or \"F\", \"B\" and \"F\" are two questions.\n8) So, the answer is B: Down.

Therefore, none of the remaining options are relevant.\n4) That leaves us with Option: E: not to be on time. While the meaning relates to arriving late, the phrase 'to bite' does not necessarily have anything to do with dogs.\n5) Finally, 'to be wrong' is something that a dog can do, but 'to be early' does not really make as much sense in this context.\n6) Therefore, the answer boils to E.\nSo the final choice is E: not to be to be late\n\nInput: If a family has 4 members, then how many is a subset?

We can eliminate this one and move to our next choice B: responsible.\n\n2. Responsible - Option 2 - Responsibility is important because it shows that the person is willing to take on accountability for their actions and decisions. As a leader, having the ability to be responsible is important for the success of the project. We can eliminate this in the next.\n\n3. Team - Option 3 - Teamwork can help facilitate collaboration, communication, and work towards a common goal. In a team-oriented environment, the team members will need to work together in order to succeed. We can eliminate this next.\n\n4.

She is now planning a trip to Europe.  In what season does she expect to travel there? Choices:  T: winter B: spring C: summer D: fall E: the time before summer\nOutput: 1-3: The key to the answer lies in 1. The wording of the question: 'does she expect to travel to Europe', not 'does she currently travel to Europe'. To answer the question we need to assume she is planning. In order to plan we need to know when she will travel. That's where she expects to travel.\n4. The question is asking us to eliminate the options \"before summer\" and \"Winter\", in which case she would not be able to travel. It must be in \"spring\" \"summer\" or \"fall\" that she decides to travel, and if \"future\" was a choice it would be a contradiction with the question. \n5. Thus, the answer is C. \nSo the final answer here is C: summer\n\nInput: In which country does the largest amount of land mass cover the continent of North America?

Canada has the second longest coastline, however, both Australia and South America both cover more area than Canada. \n4. Hence, the answer to this is choice: 'B (Antarctica).'\n\nInput: A new bakery opened a block from Lilly's house.  Which is a better way for Lilly to get to the bakery?

The question is not asking about location so A: The North Pole is incorrect\n4. The equator is located halfway between the two poles of the earth making it neither at the North pole nor at the south pole. So B: The equator is incorrect too.\n5. C is located at the other pole of the earth, the North Pole. \n6. E: Any northern hemiphere location would include a range of options such as Europe, Siberia, Japan, Greenland, and the list goes on.\n7.

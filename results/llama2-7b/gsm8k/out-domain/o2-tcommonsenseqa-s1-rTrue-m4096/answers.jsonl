Choices: \nA: Sweden B: US and Japan C: Norway D: UK E: Canada\nOutput:The correct answer is C: Norway. The question asks \"When they want to celebrate Love\". The answer has to be a country where people go to celebrate love.\nSweden: Sweden has been recognized for having a high number of committed individuals (Lynn, 2017). According to Lynn, in Sweden, marriage is not only regarded as a union between partners but rather it is a relationship between two families. The couple has to consider each other's families before the wedding day. So, this means Norway doesn't have love but celebrates marriage in their country.\nUK: The UK has several events that can be celebrated for love reasons. (Lorna R., 2019). One of the events that can be celebrated is an anniversary. The anniversary can be held from a few years to a whole year, in which a lot of families gather together. So the answer is not Norway because it doesn't celebrate love.\nCanada: Canada has a lot of events such as Valentine\u2019s Day which is recognized by most people to be celebrated for love. (Lynn, M. (2018). However, not all Canadians celebrate it. In most places in the United States, Canadians celebrate it only for one day in a year. So, the answer is not Norway.\nUS or Japan: The US and Japan are not celebrating Love. This is only celebrated on the 14th of February where a lot of people get together for various reasons.

A: They need a car B: They travel by car 150 miles C: They arrive D: They travel by bus E: They rent a car \nOutput: This question is asking us to determine what happens when a person in Albuquerqo, NM who must travel 256 miles to get to a second city. \nSo, in the given question, we know that a person must travel 25o miles from Albuquerque, NM to get to the second city. To find the correct answer to this question, we must reverse the statements made in the question. If the person is traveling 250 miles, the correct answer to this problem is that they travel by car one way (to get to the first city) and another way (to get to their final destination). We can conclude this because of the following 2 things:\n  - We know that this person travels 250 miles (one way), which is equal to 250 x 2 = 500 miles. (We know this because 250 x (2 + 1) = 1000)\n  - The two cities are 250 miles apart. This means that the final destination is 350 miles from the first city.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is: D: They travel by car, 1 way (to the first destination). Then travel another way (to the final destination).\nSo the final answer would be: D: They travel one way (to get the first destination) and then travel another way (to get their final destination)", "answer": " 624"}
{"idx": 6, "text": "1) The first step in solving this problem is to determine the number of purple flowers that Mark has. Using the data in the question, we can determine that the number of purple and yellow flowers is 100, and the number of purple.green flowers is 25. This leaves us with just nine green flowers. \n2) Using the data, we can then calculate the ratios of purple to yellow and green to yellow and purple. The ratio of purple to yellow is 80/10 = 8, and the ratio of green to yellow and purples is 9/11 = 0.8182, or 81.82%. \n3) Using these ratios, we can then determine the number of purples Mark has. Since the total number of purple plants is 100 and Mark has 8 more yellow plants than purple plants, we can solve using the formula = X + (Y  \u2013Z), where X = the number of purple plants, Y = the number of yellow plants, and Z = the number of green plants.\n4) Rearranging the formula yields X = Y - (8 -0.818 = 100 \u2013 81.8% = 98.12. \n5) Based on the values given, Mark should have 98 yellow flowers and 9 purple flowers. \nSo the final answer comes out to 98 + 9 = 107\n\n# Code:\na = int(input('Where could you find some plubming that would not be of any use to you if you were in need of drinking water?' + '\\n\\tA: Oil refinerys \\nB: Wall \\nC: Show \\nD: Your Home \\nE: Water fountain'))\n\nif (a == 1):  print (\"That's correct!\") \nelse:\n    print('That's incorrect!')\n    b = int(input('When a person is beginning work what aren't they doen yet?'+ '\\n\\t\\tA: Working\\n\\t\\tB: Resting \\n\\t\\tC: Tiredness\\n\\t\\te: momentum'))\nif (b == 1): \n    print", "answer": " 35"}

What was the number of toys in the kitchen? \n\nOutput:1. 'Ruth was in kitchen' implies that there were toys in the kitchen before and that'she took 1$/toy' means that the toys belonged to her.\n2. This context suggests that the owner of the toys is Ruth's mother. So the first part of the question must be about the number of toys Ruth took from the kitchen.\n3. The equation 'The sum is 4 less than 7 x same number of toys' states that the toys she initially had were 7 less than 4 times the same number of new toys she acquired.

This difference of 3 houses is compensated by the 2 extra pieces Anna receives per house.\n5. Hence, considering all these factors, we can find that Anna gets 14 more pieces of trick-or -sweet candy than Billy does.  (14*60-11*75 = 910-833 = 77).\nSo the final answer: Option A: 77 Pieces more", "answer": " 15"}

To do this, we have to find the weight of 1 berry and multiply that by 1000.\nUsing our equation (`Weighing Berries = 100 lb`), we can calculate the weight of 3333 berries as `100 * 3333 = 333300 lb`\nIn this part, the berries have the weight of 300000 lb so the correct answer would be between 2500 + 3000 lb.\n3) Let's look next at the weight of 36 acorns. To calculate this, we use the equation. Acorns weigh about 54 pounds, so if we multiply this by 36, we get ` 54 * 36 = 1984 lb`\nAs a result the 500 pounds is correct answer.\n4) Finally, we will need to know the weight of one salmon to know how much it weighs in total. A salmon normally weighs about 1.5 kilograms, so if we multiply `1.5` by `1000` we get `1500 lb` as a result. Hence the correct answer would be `2500+501000+2000` = 275100 lbs.", "answer": " 200"}

Z is not a valid month and the letter Z should make the year 1000 when using the letter Z, so in an era where Z was a valid month, a valid day of the year would be:\nOutput: \n\n1. The phrase \"a valid year\" could refer to a calendar year or a day in the year.\n2. The phrase \"represents\" implies symbolism or meaning, and since both the calendar maker and mathematician are interested in the symbolism of the letter, the letter must represent something. \n3. In our context, the letter 'Z' doesn't represent anything in the year 999, and hence represents something that we know will change the digit to the next multiple of 1000 as well as the year. \n4. Hence, the letter \"Z\" can be represented as 1000.\n5. There can be multiple valid days when using the letter Z because the letter Z is equivalent to 1000, the 3 digits that precede, and the 4 digits that come after. For example:\n\n\n    Day 296 = [296=1000+996]; Day 994 = [994 = 1000-6]; Day 498 = 498 = [498=1000-4]; Day 149 = [149=1000*2]  Day 22 = 22 = 100[000]; Day x = 0, where the x is 0 and 1000 can be written as 100*10.\n\n6. Therefore, the letter Z is a valid year, the year 1011, and we can find multiple valid days in the year 10,011 based on the meaning of the letter Z.\nSo the final conclusion is that:\n\n1.

From the provided data, we can see it is at least 20% less compared to Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of cars should be 20% lesser than on Tuesday.\n3: Since no data are available regarding Tuesday, we can assume the value to be between the value provided for Monday and the number of cars on Wednesday. This means there would be 5% more cars on Tuesday than on Wednesday. However, the statement says that cars on Wednesday is 2% more than those on Mondays.\n4: Therefore, using the formula of 2 - (5 - 2), we get the formula:  40% -(25 - 2) = 14%. And we can assume that the value given for Monday is the same as those for that of Tuesday.\n5: We can then multiply 20% by 14% and get the answer to be 2.8 cars. However, the value of 2.8 should be added to the value given for Monday to get the number which we assume is the same as the number of cars provided for Tuesday.\n6: And then we can repeat the same process for rest of the week and add the calculated values to get the final answer.\n7: From this procedure we get the final answer to be 81 cars, which is 1% less than the given value.\nTherefore the final answer is 81 cars.\n\n\n\nInput: You can either choose the left door or the right door.

In this context, we can understand that Henry took 9 pills in a day, for a period of 14 days. So, the total number of pills he took during this period would be 10 x 14 = 140 pills.\n3) The second part states that 'of these 9 pills: 4 pills costed $1.50, and the other pilla costed $5.50'. Here, 'These 9 pills' refers to 140 pils, which Henry took for the period of 10 days.\n4) Now let's calculate the total number of pilla he took of each price:\nFor 140 pill he took, 9 pila were $1.50 and the other was $ 5.50. So, 140 pill were $1.5 for 9 pill and $ 5.5 for the remaining 141 pill.\nTherefore, he takes $1.5 x 9 + $ 5.5 x 141 = $165.5. This means, $165.00 is the total cost of 140 pilla taken by Henry.\n5) Since the question asked for the total cost: $165. $165.

They each make a profit of $2 to sell (purchased for $2 x sold for $4) a candy bar they sold.  This is assuming that the candy bars were still sold for $2 after the profit was taken into account.  The total number of candy bars sold for Marvin and Tina was 35 and 38.  This means Marvin sold 38 candy bars and he made 20 more profit compared to Tina.\n2. At this point, we are given additional information that Tina sold 35 fewer candy bars than Marvin but still made three times more money.  From this, we find that Tina sold 5 candy bars and that she made $3 more profit for each sold candy bar.\n4.

What's the smallest 5-digit number?\nOutput:  A: If the smallest 5-letter can be expressed entirely with 3 + or - signs, then it would have to use exactly 2 + signs.\n  Let's consider an example where we use the characters '+ + - + - -' to express a 5-letter. The sum of the individual characters in this example is 3 + 3 + 1 + 1, which equals 8.\n  Hence, this expression cannot be smaller than the number 8. Therefore, this example does not represent the smallest 5-layer that can be produced with only 3 + or characters.\n  As a result, A can be ruled out.   B: Similar to A, if only 3 + or signs can construct 5-digits, then at least 3 + signs must be used. Let's look at an example to illustrate \n  an expression of 3 + signs and why this is not the smallest possible 5-digit:\n  '+ + + + +' contains 5 characters. In this expression, the individual characters are 1+1+1. Therefore, this expression must be greater than 5. Therefore, B can be ruled out.\nC:\nOnly three +/- characters can be used to create a 5-digit. So, to minimize the possible digits, at least 3 + characters must be used. Hence, the simplest 5-digit is \"5 + - - - -\" using 3 + signs. So C is the answer.\nSo the answer is C: 5 - -", "answer": " 6"}

In this problem, the cost of the ticket is $109, and the discount for children is $5. Therefore, the formula becomes:  $109 - $5 = Change\n5. Thus, by multiplying both sides by 200(the number of dollars in the $500 cash given to us), we yield the equation: $204(200) - $5(200) = Change\n6. In this formula, $204(100) - $0(100) = Change, where $5 is the discount for children, and $0 is the change. \n7. So  $200 and $0 are the only possible solutions because they are the two sides of the equation which sum up to equal Change.\n8. Thus, the solution to the problem is $200.

In order to answer the question, we first need to know how the discount of $1 works. If a box of cereal is sold at a discount, we can assume that its cost before reduction would be $1 more than the amount of the discount. Put another way, the cost is the discount's positive integer multiple.\n3. So, we can conclude that the cost of a box of cereals is $1 more than the discount, i.e.,\ncost of box of cereals = discount + 1\n\n4. The question now wants us to find how much savings will you experience upon buying 3 gallons of milk and 5 boxes.\n5. Let's begin with a few more assumptions.\n   - 3 gal whole milk is currently priced $3\n   - 1 box of cement is sold at a discout of $1\n6. Therefore, we can represent the original cost of a box of milk with C = 3$. We denote the new price of a gallon of whole milk as M = 2$, and the new cost of a box of Cereal as nm1 = $1.\n   - The discounted price of each box of cereal with the discount of $2.\n7.

{"idx": 145, "text": "1 The key element to understanding this question is understanding the order of events: the first butcher arrives at 10 a.m., then the second at 1 p.m., and then the third at dusk. 2. Because there are three butchers, we are solving a system of three linear equations, which can be done using the multiplication property. The first equation is the package number of the first butcher x 10 = 40 pounds. The second is the package number of 2nd butcher x 7 = 49 pounds. The equation for the last butcher is (4 packages + 7 packages) x 10 =40. 3. Now that we have our three equations, we multiply them together to ensure they are all independent and in their final form (that is, they don't depend on each other): (10)(10), (7)(7), (4)(4)\n\n(10)^2 = 100 (7)^2 =49 (4)^2 =4\n\n49+(40+4) = 4x49 = 196 196 + 140 + 4 =150 + 40 + 4 196 +40 + 12 = 246 (the answer)\n\nSo the final answer to this problem is 246.\n\nInput: A small business has a number of employees who earn hourly wages.

Neither employee completes 24 consecutive hours of work in a day. How many days will an average employee work in a pay cycle?\nOutput: We can say, it will be 5 days. First, we can conclude that the employees can't work continuously for 24 hours a day because they all take breaks during their work day.\n\nSecondly, we know that the employees do not take any lunch breaks back-to-back. This means that the average employee will only be working for half of the day, leaving the other half to a lunch break.\n\nThirdly, this also proves that they both work for the same number of hours.\nSo, a single employee", "answer": " 8"}

{"idx": 168, "text": "First, consider the number of minutes in each movie.  The first movie has 120 minutes, and the second movie has 180 minutes.  Each movie has a $50 cost per minute. If the cost of filming increases with each new movie, this new film should have a cost greater than the cost of filming her previous movie.  By the definition of 60%, it increases by 60%. 180 is 1.2 times 150, the length of the previous movie. 60% of this is 96, which is 150*60%/100.  This tells us the increase.  Thus, the cost of the second film is $90 per minute, which is $180*60%/$100.  So the budget of the second movie is $103800.  We know that it is 60% more than the first movie, so we know that it takes 60% more money in total to film it.  $1038,000 * 1.6 gives us the total cost of the movie.  The amount of time in minutes of this movie is the film of her first and second movies.  It is $990000/96 = 10380. 10381 - 1038, the difference, is 80 minutes, so 172800/80 = 21625, which is 216 minutes.\nSo the final total cost to film this movie is $1049625", "answer": " 1920"}

Hence, we can reasonably assume that there are at least 30 guests at Wickham\u2019s Christmas party.\n4. Wickham is hosting a Christmas party and will require a new plate for every 3-course meals which is 3 plates per person. Let us define the term person as an individual number of guests.\n5. If Wickham is serving a 3-course traditional Christmas dinner, the guests will receive 6 plates in total, and if they come with a friend, they will receive just one additional plate each.\n6. We have to assume that 1 plate per guest is not sufficient because we are also taking into consideration plus-ones which are brought by the guests.\n7. As a result, the total number of plates required for Wickham\u2019s party is 30 plates multiplied by 3 times, giving us a total number of 90 plates, and then we add 90 plus 1 because 1 is the default plate for each guest and 1 additional plate for guests with plus-ones.\n8.

Since the number of cars that Bobby has increases by 5.0% every year, we can use the formula 100/(1+0.05) to calculate how many cars Bobby would have when the first year ends. We get 32 cars.\n2: To calculate how many cars Bobby will have in the second year, we know that the number of cars he had in the first year increased by 50%; let's call that N1. The formula for calculating the number of cars that a quantity will increase by in a year is: n = 1.05^n - 1. In our problem, n = 2 (we know that the number of car is increasing by 50% over the first year, so the next year means it will be increasing by 2 extra percent). Let x denote the number of cars in the first year, in this case x = 32. We solve 1.05^(2) - 1 = x + 1.05 for x: x + 1.61 > x Therefore, x = 22. We can conclude that Bobby has 22 cars in his collection in the second year.\n3: Let's calculate how many cars Bobby has by the third year. First, we want to calculate n as before. To do this, we need to determine the value of N2; N2 = 2.05^2. Let x1 denote how many cars Bobby had in the first year, and x2 denote how many cars he had the second year. x1 + x2 = 32 + 22 = 54 cars, because we add how many cars Bobby had the previous two years which was x1 + x2. Then we solve 2.05^(2.05) - 1 = 54. We get the equation 1.4153 = x1 + x2, and x1 = -1.415. Therefore, x2 = 54 - 1.41 = 52.5.\n4: From the second year, we have x1 = 22, and x2 = 52.

One possible approach is to start with a concrete example or scenario to guide the solution.\nExample or Scenario: Let's imagine that Ravi has exactly $0.60. So, he definitely has 6 nickels because $0.60 = 6 x 0.1. And he has 4 dimes because $0.64 = 4 x 0.16.\n\nSolution: To continue, let's say he has a total of 4 quarters because $0.80 = 4 x 20. So, he has 1 quarter more than nickels, 2 quarters more than dimes, and 1 quarter more than dollars. Now, let's break down the scenario further:\n\n$0.80 + $0.84 + $0.88 + $0.80 + 4 x $0.16 = $0.80, where we've combined all the dollars, and 21 dimes, and 4 quarters, to get the total of $2.80.\n\n$0.60 + $0.64 + $0.68 + $0.60 + 6 x $0.10 = $0.60, where we're putting together 26 nickels, and 6 dimes, and 3 quarters to get the total of 30. \n\nAdd $2.80 and $30 to get $32.80. \n\nThus, Ravi has 32.80$ in coins, of which $6.00 is in nickels, $4.00 is in dimes, and $2.80 is in quarters.

The second part of the question also deals with quantity in the form of time.\n    - The part where She jogs 5mph can be translated to n units/h and five days can be converted to 5 hours. \n    - Hence, the overall condition for Mira can be represented: Every = n days => 2h/n\n3) The third part of the question gives us only one variable: two hours. Hence, the conditions as stated earlier can be simplified to: nh/2 or every = 2h\n4) This implies that every or n will either = 2 or = 1 for the complete duration she jogs (5 days).\n5) Hence, n could equal either 1 or 2 for the complete duration of 5 days.\n6) Assuming n = 1, then the solution will be 2. Assuming n = 2, then the solution will also be 2. Hence, the final answer is 2\nSo the final answer in this question is D: 2\n\nInput: Which of the following is a common time waster in the kitchen?

Firstly, we can eliminate the options based on the first part of the question- a common time waster.\n\t- A: Time wasted in the kitchen. Me neither does slicing neither dices.\n\t- So, this option is out.\n\t- B: time wasted in the kitchen = dices\n\t- Again, since dices isn't a logical answer, we can't have dices.\n\t3. Hence, we are left with options- A, D, E. \n4. Similarly, looking at the second part of the question- 'how often do you do this when it goes wrong?' we can eliminate further options", "answer": " 50"}

Choices B, C and D: If the clock shows 7:07, 7:10, and 7:12 respectively, then the total elapsed time will be 10+7+10+12 = 39 minutes, rather than the given answer of 40 minutes. This is because the given question did not include the 10th minute after 07:00. Hence, not all answers are correct.\n\n3. Choice E: Clocks with the times 12:xx, 13:xx, and so on, do not display minutes. Hence choice E is incorrect.\n4. Choices F: None of these choices are the correct answers.\n\nSo the final answer will be 10:07", "answer": " 59"}

Choices; A: Having no money to spend B: Having no money to give C: Having the perception of having no money D: Having no money to invest E: Having no money to lend\n\nOutput:To understand, the question needs to be broken down into several parts, as there are actually several separate ideas being discussed here. \n\nSo let's look at the first piece of the puzzle: Having no money. This option is clearly the only choice where you don't actually have any money. It's the most extreme form of 'no money' in that it literally says you have nothing. No money = no money. \n\nThe second piece is 'to spend'. To spend is to utilize something for a specific purpose or to spend on something. As such, it's an activity - not an object - and only applies when you have money, so 'having no money to spend' is a logical contradiction in terms. \n\nThe third piece is 'to invest'. To invest is to invest in something, so it would go hand in hand with having money, as you couldn't invest without some form of assets to begin with. 'having no money' doesn't apply at all. \n\nNow let's look more closely at the remaining options and see if they fit the bill. Have you ever heard of anyone who is without money but wants to lend someone money? That's certainly an argument for option D, but the question says you \"have no money\", which again means that you have none - no money, not just a little bit. \n\nWhat about those who are desperate for money but cannot spend", "answer": " 40"}

{"idx": 251, "text": "1. The question asks how heavy the weights felt when being lowered.\n2. The exercise machine uses special technology that makes the weights 20 % heavier on the lower part.\n3. So Tom should take 10 weights x 10 weights x (1 / (100% + 20%)) which is equivalent to 10 x 10 x (0.9 / 120%), which can be simplified to 10x10x(0.0833 or 8.33%).  So, it means that 8.33% of the weight is added everytime one lifts and then lower the weight and this is equivalent to the weight increase by 0.32 x 10 which is equivalent to 3.2 pounds or 1.4 kg.  Therefore, we can say that when Tom was lowering the weights  each additional 140% of the weight of each added weight is added into each additional weights when its lowered. So it means that Tom should feel 140% more weight on each one of the lifts.\nSo the final weight is (150 x 8/7)/3 = 16kg/20kg which means it is a 8/20 which means a reduction in the weights and the final weight is ( 150 - 8 x 16) = 150% of the actual weight. \nSo the final answer for the weights that Tom felt is equivalent to 150%.\nSo the final answer to the question is 150% (16kg/2kg) which means the plates felt much heavier when lowering and Tom has to do this 150% times of his actual lifts.", "answer": " 360"}

However, the question doesn't include any information about the building so we can't determine its size or shape.\n2) The passage continues \"starting at zero at noon.\" This tells us that the shadow length at noon is zero, regardless of the building's size or shape.\n3) From the passage, we can infer that every hour past noon, the length of the shadow increases by 5ft.\n4) To calculate the length of the shadow 6 hours after noon, we need to apply the formula: s = ut + 1/2at^2 where s is the shadow length, u is the initial shadow length, t is the time interval (in this case, 6 hours), and a and b are constants that depend on the building's shape and size.\n5) Since the initial shadow length at noon was equal to 0, we can plug in u = 0 into the formula and simplify: s = (6/2)*5 + 0 = 30ft\n6) Therefore, the final answer is that the shadows from the buildings 6 hours past noons are 30ft long.\nSo the final answers is B: 30 ft\n\nInput: You bought stocks that go up when there are bad days.

{"idx": 262, "text": "1) To answer this question, consider the two conditions: i) A person can buy 4 apppe and 1 watermelons for the same price. ii) Buy 36 fruits, evenly among orange, apples, and watermelons.\n2) If we can buy only 4 apples and 1 watermelsons for the same price means each apple costs $3.94 \n3) For buying 36 fruits means, every orange costs $0.50 and the total cost is $66. Let c denote the cost of 1 apples. Therefore, 1 apple costs c + 0.5.\n4) If every orange cost $0.50, then,\n5) Therefore, the cost of 1 apple is (c + 0.5) / 4 apples\nSo, therefore, the cost of 2 apples is (c + 1.25) / 4\nAlso, the cost of 3 apples is (c+1.88) / 4\nTherefore, the cost of 4 apples is (c-c) / 4\nLet S denote the cost of 4 apple. Therefore 4 apple costs S. \nTherefore, cost of one apple is (S-S) / S. As S is an even number, so, the cost of one apple is 1/S.\nTherefore, the answer is $21.33 or $1/3.94\nSo the final answer to the question is $21.60 or $1/394\n\nInput: At the car wash, one can purchase car wash for $12.99, a shampoo for $3.99, and a vacuum for $14.99.

However, his shoulder height is 15% less, or 20% when it's been reduced by a percentage.\n       - Barry can reach an apple that is 5 feet high.\n       - They'll pick an apple that is 60 feet high.\nBased on the facts above, let's assume that Barry and Lar' both have a height of 5 feet, but Larry's shoulder height is less than his full height by 20%. This assumption is important because it establishes the relationship of Larry's height to his shoulder height.\n1. For our calculations, let's assume Larry is 60 feet tall and his shoulder height is also 60. This is so we can say that when Barry stands on his shoulders, he makes himself 5 feet tall.\n2. When we assume that Barry and Larry are both 60 feet tall, we are saying that Barry is 15% higher than Larry. However, when we calculate Larry's shoulder height, we need to subtract 20%, meaning only 75% of his height, which is 45 feet. Thus, when we say that Barry is 1% higher than Larry, we are saying that he's 75 feet high, which is 7% higher than Larry's height. Therefore, when Barry stands on a person's shoulders that is 7% higher height than him, Barry's height is also 7% higher.\n3. We can put this all together to state that when Barry stands on a height that is 7% more than a smaller height, his resulting height will be 7% higher. Thus, when someone 5 feet in height stands on someone 45 feet in height, their resulting height will be 495% of the original height.\n4. For example, we can say that if we start with an apple that is 3 feet high, when Barry stands on top of Larry and Larry's shoulders, the outcome will be that Larry and Barry will have access to apples that are 638.5 feet high.\nSo the final solution is:\n   - When Barry stands on top of a height that is 5% taller than a smaller height, he", "answer": " 9"}
{"idx": 267, "text": "1. First, we should understand each choice in terms of the overall context to be able to determine the correct answer. The expression 'he goes to the gym' refers to a recurring activity.\n2. The word 'times' suggests that this is an event that takes place regularly on three separate days. This means that it cannot be an event occurring on one particular day.\n3. The word 'during' does not imply that an activity takes place continuously. It means the activity involves breaks.\n4. Based on the above understanding, it can be deduced that one hour is spent on each day by John lifting weights to develop his strength. And 'his weightlifting time' refers to the time he spends actually lifting weights.\n5. From the given information, the total time per day is 3 hours.\n6. On the other hand, 'additionally, he also spends' means he spends more than one hour per day (3 hours = 45 minutes) on weightlifting. This adds up to a total weightlifting time of 1.5 hours.\n7. This means that he spends 3 hours lifting weights a day and an extra 45 minutes on other weightlifting-related activities like warming up and cardiovascular exercises. So he spends a total of 3.5 hours on weightlifting.\n8. But if he goes to the gym three times a week on three different days, then each exercise takes a total of 2 weeks to complete. This means that it's unlikely that he can be at the gym non-stop for 2 weeks. So it's logical that we can subtract 2 weeks from 26 days.\n9. Therefore, John spends 6.5 hours at the gym per week. Hence, the right answer is D: 6.5 hours.\nSo the final  answer is D: 26th day\n\nInput:  A man lives on the East Coast of a continent shaped like the letter \u201cW\u201d.

This is incorrect for the following reasons:\ni) A structure built with cards is not strong enough to stand if it is subjected to strong wind.\nii) The word 'inside' and 'outside' do not match the usage in the question, and hence, the answer does not make sense.\n2) In answer B: 'There is an Easter egg hiding inside.' Choosing the card as an Easter egg indicates that the structure collapses because of a hidden object. In a house of cards, there is usually no easter egg, nor is it hiding. Even if there was one, the house would probably collapse with a loud noise even without strong external influence. This incorrect answer makes it a difficult choice.\n3) In answer C: 'The first card isn't enough.'

We will also need to plug in the other two values to find b_c and g_b.\nThis requires algebra, so we won't go into it here.\n\n1. The other option consists of using high school math, which requires solving equations with three variables. \n2. Let's say the total water used is A. The following equation is one method for finding p:\n\nLet's consider the variables. Let's define P as the amount of water used which will go to Farmer BOB's farm, Q as the amount of water that will go towards Farmer BRENDA's farm, and R stands for the amount of water that goes to Farmer Bernie's farm.\nThe variables in this case are 'P', 'Q', and 'R'. \n3. To solve for p, we define another variable 'A' = 'P' + 'Q' + 'R':\n\nWhen variables are added like this, it means the value of A must be equal to the sum of p + q + r.\nThus, to solve for p, we take the following equation and substitute the above definitions to find p by solving for 'A' and then dividing each side by 'A'.\nFor this instance, we will use", "answer": " 36"}

There are 7 days in a week. A day consists of 24 hours. Carl can type 50 words per hour, so he will need to type 1200 words per day.\n3. If Carl types continuously for 8 hours each day, his total word count will be = 1200 x (1200/24) x 7 = 43800 words.\n4. However, as he will take a 4-hour break every day, we will need to multiply each 8-hour day by 0.8 to take account of the time Carl will not type during a day, which will make his total word count = 438 x (120 x 0.8) = 44832 words.\n5.

A train ticket seller asks, \u201cAre you planning to take the train?\u201d The man replies, \u201cI am\u201d. The ticket seller then asks, \u201cWhere is your ticket?\u201d. The man replies, \"I got one\u201d. How many shoes had he bought?\nOutput:\n\n\nThe correct answer is 2.\n\nHere we first have to consider what the question is actually asking for. The question consists of a series of questions and answers, starting from \"Are you planning to take a train?\" \"I am\", meaning that he already already has a ticket to take the train.\n\nNow we come to the heart of the question, \"Where is your ticket?\". Based on the previous question and answer, the second question does not ask \"where is your ticket in general\", but is actually asking \"where is your ticket for getting on the train?\"\nTherefore, we can deduce that the man is taking the train right now, therefore he must have a ticket already.\n\nIf so, we can then answer the second question: he has a ticket. The ticket contains a unique serial number to identify its owner and its validity period. There should only be two tickets: one for himself in order to board the train and the other for his friend. Therefore the total number of tickets is \"1\".\n\nIn regards to shoes, when he replies with the number \"2\", it means that he is wearing two shoes - one and the other.

Thus, there must be 48 cows on the farm to be pregnant. \n3) The next step is to find the total number of cows from the first and third steps. Then, multiplying by 2 (for pregnant cows) brings the answer to 95 cows.\n4) To verify: In this case, there are 50% female cows, so there are 50 female cows. If each female has 0.5 chance of being pregnant (for each of the 50 animals), then the expected number of pregnant female cats is 1 (since there are 50 pregnable cows). Thus, the actual number of pregnant cats is 96 to 97 (ranging from 95 to 96), and the expected value lies between 95 and 96. \n5) After verifying, the answer to the question is equal to half of expected pregnant cats, plus 1, which equals 22 (since half of 48 equals 24). \nSo the final answer if (22/2).\n\nInput:In this question, you're given the values that make up the number of students within the class.

{"idx": 350, "text": "1. To solve the initial equation, we can start by expressing the values given for the variables and writing down the given information.\n2. Starting with the first equation:\n`P = C + G`\n3. Since the initial information shows that the farmer has twice as much pigs as cows\n4.  We know that:\n`p + c = 2 * P`\n5. Also, we know that he has 4 more cows :\n`c + 4 = C`\n6. Finally we know that the total number of animals in the farmers possession is `56`\n7. Substituting the information given into the first equation we get\np = 2 * 1 + c + 4\n8. Taking the left side of the equation and rearranging so we get\n`2 * p + c + 4 = p + c + 2 * c + 5 = 3 * c + 5`\n9. So, finally, we can get the solution for the first equation as.\n`p = (3 * c + 46) / 2`\n10.

Since it is written that one of the friends have twice the rest, we can simply deduce that there is only 1 friend with twice as much wealth than the other 2 combined and the other two friends have the same wealth.\n3. So, we can get the final expression for the net worth for the group by distributing, which gives us\n`A + B = 2 * (A + B)`\n 4. and simplifying the first expression gives us\n`(A + B) / 2 = A + 2 * A`\n5.

{"idx": 366, "text": "1). The question can be rephrased as 'how long does it take the fastest runner to cross the finish line after the slowest runner has already crossed?'\n\n2). We can break this expression in steps.\nStep 1: The question is 'how long it takes the fastest runner to get to the finish line after the finish line has already been crossed.?'\nBy definition, at some point, each runner has already crossed the finish line, so the time they take to finish the race is an interval between crossing and finishing the race, and by definition it cannot be the same for all of them. \nStep 2: The fastest runner finishes his race in 8 hours.\nStep 3: The last of all the other runners finish 2 hours later. (that means that in the interval of time between finishing the race of the fastest runner and finishing the race of the last runner, there are, in total 3 hours.)\nStep 4: So, the total time taken by the eight runners is 8 + 3 = ___. (since they started together and the race has already crossed, they start at different point in this interval of time.)\n\n3). Now, calculating the number of other runners finish the race (2-1) after the fastest runner has finished his race, then, by definition the number of other runner's race is equal to the interval (time after the fastest runner finished their race).\nSo, number of other runner's race = (time after fastest runner finished)\n\n4). The question is: How many times '(time after fastest runner) = ___' that is, how many times '2 = ___'. If it is how much equals how many times? This is 5 times, 2 equals 5. \nIt is equal to how much equals 5 times. The fastest runner takes 8 hours and the slowest runner takes 10. So, all the runners will complete 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 hours later.\n\nTherefore the total time the eight runner took to finish the race = 8 + 2 = 10 hours.\nSo, the final answer is 10.\n\nInput: What do all these students eat together?

The sum of interior angles of a square is 360 degrees, which can be understood by multiplying the number of angles by each unique angle to get a total of 360 degrees.\nThis means that when one side of a square has a length of 1, each interior angle is equal to 360/4 = 90 degrees. Thus, each side of a square is also 90 degrees. \nSince the interior angle of a square is 90 degrees, the exterior angle is also 90\u00b0 but from the other side of the equilateral polygon (2 sides).\nTherefore, the maximum angle created from any given side of the square is 90\u00b0.\n\nInput: Is the letter 'G' in any of the world's languages?\nOutput: The letter G is not in any of the world\u2019s languages.\nG: Latin origin and the only letter that is not part of the Roman alphabet.\nInput: Given the following statements, choose whether or not they are logically equivalent.P=1&Q=2&R=3&S=A.

In that case, each cube has six faces, each of which measures 1x1x1 - a total of 6 cubes. Each row measures 6 units in length, for a total of 36 units. This is the same as eight 4-wide rows and so, eight long rows.\nB. 96 blocks: This makes sense too. Each row measures 9 units in length, for 72 total unit length. This is the same number of unit length as six rows of eleven blocks (8 x11 = 9).\nC. 72 blocks: 72 blocks make sense if the blocks here are not cubic in shape. Consider a square block with corner lengths of 2 units. Then, a row of eight blocks measures 8 units in length. Thus, there are 24 blocks in a row. There are eight rows in an 8x8 grid, making it 192 blocks. A 8 x 8 grid requires 82 blocks which are 72 of these square blocks\nD. 81 blocks: This answer does make sense as well. If we suppose that there are 81 cubic blocks in an 8\u00d78 grid, each row must consist of twelve units of these cubes. Each cube has six sides which all measure 1 unit, for a total of six sides of length 6 units. We want that each side measures 7 units. Thus, the block must be 11/6 units tall. Thus there are eight rows, each with a height of 9 units. It took us a bit of work to determine that the units length of each", "answer": " 5"}

The final sum has to come by finding the product of feed and chicken.  2*25pounds = 50pounds(as feed) \n3. $65 is equivalent to the final price or profit of every chicken. We have to subtract the cost to reach the profit.  $65 - $2 = $63\n4. $65 is  equal to the final cost of total feed for 5 chicken, as feed for 1 chicken comes to $2.  $1.5 *4 = $6 \n5. We can easily reach the answer by subtracting total final cost from the total final gain. (63 - 6 = 57, as final gain = 57) We just add the final gain and each feed's worth to get total feed.

First, let's calculate the number of spiders that have a total of eight legs. To do this, we use the given information, multiply eight by 10, and subtract one-half the product from that result:  8 x 10 = 80  80 - (1/2 * 80) = 44 Thus, with ten more spiders than half the amount of legs that a single spider has (i.e. 8 legs), there are 44 spiders that have a combined total of 8 legs.\n 2. Next, let's calculate how many legs there are among all the group of 44 spiders. To do this, let's add the sum of the individual legs of each spider that has a combined total of 12 legs. The sum of 8 + 8 + 8  = 24 The sum of 6 + 6 + 6  = 18 The sum of 4 + 4 + 4  = 12 The sum of 2 + 2 + 2  = 6 Thus, the sum of the individual spider legs is 44 + 24 + 18 + 12 + 6 = 100\nSo the total number of spidder legs is 100\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions about the following sentence.\n\nInput: The two men who were walking down the street saw a shark fin.\nOutput: Let's analyze the sentence to understand what it implies about the two men.\n\n**Analysis: 1.

This requires us to determine what number Carla wins, and subtract that from 30 to find the number of games Carla loses.\n5. The process is now simplified, so we can apply the following equation to solve for Carla's wins:\n  5 = 5 - C\n  10 = 5 - C, where C = Carla's number wins\n6.

Here are a few facts to remember:\n\n- Total number of people on the dance team: 25\n- Amount of people that quit: 8\n- Amount of new people that got in: 13\n2: Now, let's apply the above facts to solve the problem. We begin by counting the quitting people (8) and then adding the new people (13). This means that the total number of people on the team has gone from:  25 - 8 + 13 = 61 people\n3. To verify our answer, we can verify each step taken previously and ensure that the numbers make sense. When we begin with: Total number of people on team: 25 + Amount of quitting people: 8 + Amount of new people:13 = 60 people  \nBut when we add to what we have: Total number of people (25) + Amount of quiting people: 8 + Total number of people that got in:13 = 30 + 8 + 19 = 67 people  \n4. When we total 67 people on the team. This number makes 67 > 60, and so, it could not be the case that the total number of dancers went down after 8 people quit. Thus, our answer remains unchanged from before: Total number of people: 61 on the team. \nSo the final answer remains A: 61\n\nInput: What is the total weight of the group?

Given this information and using logical deduction, we can conclude that 80 percent of the jury is between the ages of 30 to 50 while 20 percent of the juriy is less than 30 years old\". \nTo answer this question, we first need to calculate how many Judges are over the age of 50. We can't simply calculate this by dividing all 40 judges by 40 to answer, because we know from the question that 60% are within that age range, which is 24 judges. So, when we divide 40 by 40, we count them in that 60% and ignore them, which tells us nothing about the number of judges over 50. \nNow let us assume that there are total 80 judges. Based on what we know from question, we can assume that 10 percent of them are less than 30 (40/10 = 4) and remainder are 56 (40 - 4 = 56). \nNow we find a common factor (or multiple of number) by common factor formula, we get 2.5, but we don't want to use 2.5 because remainder (56) is less than the numerator, i.e., we are left with less than 30%. We do not want that. Thus we cannot use factor of 2.5. Now, we cannot use 1.5 (to 1.5*30 = 45, which is greater than remainder 56) or 16 as 16/30 = 4/5 which is too far from remainder 56. Thus, the factor is too far either from numerator or remainder. \nTo find a factor which is less than 16, we must consider that number which can make a remainder with a remainder (56 and 16).  It is (56/16) or 3 which is less than 4 (numerator). Thus, our common factor is 3. So, from 40", "answer": " 12"}

The car was in the mountain scene.  The car was the only picture not on the board at the start.\nOutput:1. We know the puzzle is of a car and mountain, which is found on the board because we know they were present at the start. \n2. A car picture was seen by the last player, and not on the board, and so is the only unaccounted-for picture. This is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer a: the picture was of a car\n\nInput:The puzzle was three mountains, a small house, two waterfalls and an elephant on the ocean.  Six people worked on the puzzle during three rounds.  At the start of the last round no two people who worked on later rounds saw the same piece.  The person who didn\u2019t see anything and everyone who found a waterfall didn\u2019t see the puzzle at the start.  In the first round someone who saw at least two pieces of the puzzle saw an elephant. \nOutput:1. At the start of the round, only the person who found an elephant could have seen everything\n2. If more than 2 people saw a waterfall, it is impossible for the person who found a waterfall to be one of those people, so only the person who found the waterfall is the one who didn\u2019t see the rest of the board.\n3. The only one that might've seen everything is the person who didn't see anything\n4. Therefore", "answer": " 6"}

{"idx": 506, "text": "1.) To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in the pen, which is 81, and subtract 10% of that number, which is 8.1. By doing this, we get that there are 81 - 8 = 73 sheep remaining in the pen. 2.) However, we are told that the sheepdog rounded up 100% of the sheep, which means that 90% of 81 = 73 is actually 74 sheep that were rounded up. 3.) Furthermore, we can deduce from the given information that the 10% of sheep that were left went into hiding, and the sheepdog did not round them up. Therefore, the number of sheep that we need to consider is 81 + 90% + 10% = 81 + 6.1 + 0.1 = 83.1 sheep. In the end, there are 83.1 out of the 81 sheep in total, for a total of 95.1% out of the 83.1 remaining in the pen, and 5.1% out in the wilderess.\nSo the final answers is A: 95.1%, B: 95.9%  and C: 98.2%\n\nInput:Why is it that when you get to school, some people say it's time to start making time instead of excuses? \nOutput: Since the statement, \u201cwhen it\u2019s time to start making something, it\u2019s time to make excuses\u201d, implies that sometimes there is no need to make excuses for not starting something, it should be interpreted  as \u201cwhy then should you make excuses when there are opportunites for making things\u201d.

Let's look at each day and calculate the average distance:\n   - Monday: The question does not provide the specific distance Terese ran on Monday, so we will calculate the average based on the information given. We know that Terese ran 4.2 miles total on Monday, and we also know that she ran for three days out of the week.  Therefore, 4.2 is divided by 3 to get the average. It gives: 1.4 miles per day.\n   - Tuesday: The question does not mention any specific distance, but we can calculate the average based on what information is given. We know that Tuesday's average is 3.8, and Terese ran for just one day. So, divide the 3.8 by 1 and we get the average as 3.8 miles per day.\n\n3. Wednesdays Average: The question does not give specific information about the distance Terese ran, but we can calculate it based on what information is available. We know that the average is 3.6. We also know that Terese ran two days this week, so we divide 3.6 by 2. The result is 1.8 miles per day run by Terese.\n   4. Thursdays Average: The same process applies. From the information provided in the question, Thursday's average distance is 4.4, and Terese ran three days this week. So divide 4.4 by 3 and the answer is 1.5 miles per day.

The half of the remaining rest are all different kinds, so it must have a unique number of pieces, if it is not equal to the number of pieces in the other half.\n3. There are 25 different types, as long as we add the pieces from the second half it should also have a unique number, as the number of pieces for the second half is not the unique number. \n4. After this step we see that there are 5 layers of limestones, 6 layers of sandstones, 2 layers of shales. Hence, there are 12 layers that have a unique number of rocks in them, since they are the only ones where all the given conditions apply to each and every layer. \n5. The total number of rocks in the strata is 25 + 12 = 37.\n6. Now, let us say that we have 37 blocks of rocks, then the possible number combinations is 4^6, 37 = 1099824031776.\n7. From the conditions given, we already knew that all the blocks that are 5, 6 and 9 has the unique number of rocks in it, so we can deduct from here that not only 5, 6 or 9 blocks of rocks is unique, \nbut every 5, 6, 9th blocks is unique. \n8. 5 = 1, 6 = 8, 9 = 33 \n\n1.5, 6.5, 9.5.\nThese are the unique numbers for every 5th block, not counting it as 4+1 = 5. \n9.

The word \"infinite\" is not an actual word used in math, and should be ruled out. \n2. The question gives no other information on the distance the person could walk in an hour.\n3. The word \"hour\" does suggest a more restricted amount of time like a day, week, month or year, but the word \"hour\" is not defined, leaving the question open ended.\n4. By excluding the word \"infinite\", choice A: \"1\" could be used but is too narrow and should be disregarded. This leaves options B and C.\n5. An additional consideration that may be helpful when considering the word \"infinite\" in choosing the correct answer is to take into account the context of the entire passage for perspective that could provide a clarification for the reader's reference. The passage does not end at the stated question, but continues on. The passage could be interpreted in many ways. \n6. In the first continuation sentence after the stated question, the word \"week\" is written. The word \"week\" limits the word \"infinite\". While the person cannot walk beyond 24 during that week, there is nothing to indicate that he or she may not walk an infinite number of miles between two days. Therefore, it should be concluded that 24 is the correct answer. \n7. Therefore, the final answer is 4.

{"idx": 526, "text": "1. Carla would be spending at least $43. The answer is obtained by first calculating the gas mileage Carla's car can achieve. This can be done by dividing the total mileage by the car's average gas mileage. In this case, the total mileage is 40, and the average gas mileage is 25. Hence, we divide 40 by 25 to get 1.6, which means the car can travel 6 miles per gallon. \n2. Next, we must calculate the total cost of gas Carla will need to purchase for her trip. Carla will need to drive 8 miles from her house to the grocery and back. To travel the 8-mile distance, Carla's car needs 0.6 (because 8 \u00f7 25 = 0.6). Then, she would also need to travel 6 miles to pick her kids up from school. If it takes 3 gallons of gas to travel 6 miles, then Carla would be speding 3.0 (3 \u00d7 1 ) in gas. \n3. Similarly, to travel 12 miles to soccer practice, Carla would be required to refill her tank again, and if it takes another 3 gallons to travel 12, she would use 3.0 ( 3 \u00d7 1) and finally to complete the whole task, it comes to 6 miles (for the return trip to school) which means we need 2.0 ( 6 \u00d7 1) in gas. \n4. Now if we sum the first 3 travels, we get 5.0 (5.0 \u00d7 1) miles gas refilling. Since 5.0 gallons of gas costs $5.0 (5 \u00d7 1), Carla would need to buy $5.0 in gasoline to travel 5.0 miles.\n5.

First, note that the profit margin is equal to the whole profit after the price that is calculated. Then you can deduct the original price to get the price to sell the bag.\n3. To apply this formula: Profit = 15% of price. The first step is to get the cost or price to sell the bag (without the tax/income margin).

Given the number of people in line 84, the number of seats in each car 2, and the total number of cars on the rollercoaster 7.\n2. The operation of the roller coaster is straightforward; once empty, the cars are lined up waiting for people to get in. When fully populated, 2 people enter the car, the car then rolls onto the tracks and completes one lap around the park. This process is completed by the ride operator.\n3. To calculate the number of times the rollercoaster operator has to run and make a loop, we begin by identifying the number of cars in line at one time:\n   - If there are 2 people in each car, and there are 2 cars occupied and 1 empty, there are 3 passengers (2*2 + 1 = 3)\n   - If there is one empty car, and 2 occupied ones (2*2-1=1), there are 2 passengers total (1+1=2)\n   - The total number of passengers in line is 5.\n4. After calculating the number of passengers in line, we need to identify the number of rows and therefore the number of operations to give everyone a ride. We know that when riding a roller coaster, people are always seated in one row \u2013 in one car, two passengers sit side by side, facing each other. This means that there can only ever be 2 rows in operation at one time, so there are only 2 operations.\n5. Therefore, calculating the total number of times the rollarcoaster operator has to make a loop, we get the result 2, because if there were 3 or 4 passengers in line, the operator has to make a 2nd loop to accommodate each additional passenger. If there were 3, the ride operator would run the roller coater 6 times, and if there were 4, he would run it 4 times, then it would reach capacity of 5. Hence, the final answer is 2: there are 2 x's 2 times because there are 2 people per seat, and there are 5 people waiting for a ride.\nSo the final number of times the rolller co", "answer": " 6"}

The given problem asks the question, \"How many miles does Michelle (in this trip) drive?\" from the given information.\n3. After reading the question carefully, the first thing that comes to mind is the sentence \"Tracy drives 20 more than twice.\"\n  * In this sentence, the term 'twice' is used to imply that Tracy would drive twice the mileage than Michelle, which can be interpreted as 'Tracy would drive 20 more than how many miles Michelle drives.' This is because Tracy drives as many miles as Michelle but also drives 20 extra miles.\n  * The number of miles that Tracy would drive would then be given by:\n    * '20+2*(miles Michelle drive)'\n    * where'miles Michelle drive' = Michelle's mileage in miles\n      * hence,'miles Michelle' are needed to be substituted for this expression. \n  * Therefore, the number of miles that Trac drives is given by:\n    = 20 + 2*(miles Michell drive)\n    = 23 (from basic formula for addition)\n  * '20'(2) + 2*(m)\n  * 23 = Trac's Miles\n4.

{"idx": 588, "text": "We can model this scenario as a linear equation, where x represents the daily amount of time spent working, and y represents the daily amount of hours spent catching up with pals. The given information provides us with enough data to calculate and solve for the unknown value of x.\n1. We can assume that Jeff works for x hours every day, and that he catches up with his pals for y hours every day, where x > y.\n2. Since x and y are the unknown values, we can express these relationships in the form of an equation, where x represents daily working hours and y represents daily catching-up hours.\n3. We know that Monday through Friday, Jeff spends 4 times more hours working than he does catching up, which means that the working hours, x, are greater than the catching-up hours, y.\n4. Based on this information, we can write down the equation for x = 4, which indicates that Jeff spends four times more hours working than catching-up.\n5. We can also use this equation to calculate the value of y, where y = x/3, which means that Jeff spends 3 hours per day catching-up. Given that Jeff spends 4x hours working, the total number of hours spent by him each day working and catching-up could be calculated using the equation x + y = 4x. Thus, he spends 3+x hours in total, per day.\n6. If we were to substitute x with 4 and divide it by 4, we find that x = 1, and we can then find the answer by substituting the value of x into the equation x + y, which results in an answer of x+y = 4+1. Therefore, the final answer to the question is 10, indicating that Jeff spends 10 hours every day, both working and catching up, with his Facebook pals.\nSo the final solution is answer is D: 3+x = 4x = 10\n\nInput: What's the only thing you lose when you lose your health?\nOutput: The only thing that you lose when you lose one's health is your health.\nSo the final outcome is A: your health", "answer": " 62"}

Here we see that the number of rabbits added is equal to:\n   -'seven' rabbits\n  - 21 rabbits  \n2) Next let's use basic logic to determine the final response. The answer will be 21 when we apply the concept of division to the equation because the total rabbits added to the cage is seven. Then we can see that one-third of a group of thirteen rabbits is 4.33... which is the same as saying that when this group of rabbits is divided by three, each rabbit gets 1.43... When we plug these values into the given equation, we find that five rabbits is added to the cage.\n3) To find this final answer, we need to remember that when rabbits are added to a cage, it is understood that the number of rabbit will increase if they are placed in a cage, and in the same way, the final response can be explained, saying that ten plus seven rabbits is equivalent to seventeen rabbits with the given statement of \"Jasper see ten rabbits in the park.\"\nSo the final answer will be 20 (17 + 3)\n    \n     \nInput:What will we not see in the middle of the circle, no matter where we stand, if we face the center point?

{"idx": 628, "text": "1.'A chair costs 1\\/7 of the cost of the table.' This can be simplified to '1/7 = C/T.'\n2. To solve this problem, we have to follow this formula: C = (1/7) * T = (1/7 * 140) = 20. \n3. From that, we can infer that the cost of a chair is $20. \n4. So, C = 20 and T = 20 * 5 = 100. \n5. Putting all this information into the question, 140/20 = (140 * C)/(20 * T) \n6. Here, C = 2, and T = 5, so 140/40 = 3.5. \n7.

This is actually quite simple to answer because what we have to do is:\n3. take 200/0.25 which is 800, to find out what is left in the can after drinking 25% of its content.\n4. In the real answer, if the can is 24 ounces, then:\n5. 800/24 = 33.3\n6. Therefore, 25% is equivalent to 33.3% because we multiply the decimal number to find out what is in the 24 ounce can of chocolate drink\nSo the final answer will be 33.3", "answer": " 220"}

Based on the provided information, we know that Mary and Rose both spent $100 on one pair of jeans each and $50 on a pair of sunglasses each. We also know that they both bought a deck of basketball cards, but how many decks they bought remains unclear.\n3. To calculate the cost of Deck of basketball cards we have to calculate the cost of one deck. Rose bought two decks of basketball, so the cost of one deck is two times the cost which she bought per deck.\n\nSince we know the cost of one deck of basketball cards to Rose, we can calculate the cost of one Deck of basketball cards to Mary.\n\n4: Since we know the cost of Rose's shoes, we can calculate Mary's cost of shoes.\n5: To calculate the total cost of each shopping spree, we can sum the costs of each item. For Mary, the total cost of her shopping spree is $400 (2 sunglasses at $50 each, 2 decks of basketball cards at $150, and 1 pair of jeans at $100) and For Rose the total cost of her shoppin spree is $20o (1 pair of shoes at 150 and 2 decks of bball cards at 150).\n6: Since Rose and Mary spent the same amount on shopping, We can say that the value of Rose's total spending is $ 200 + 400 = $ 600 and the value of Mary's spending is 200 +400 = \\$600.\n7. In the final step, we must determine how Mary and Rose spent equal amounts on shopping.\n8. The given information shows that Rose and Mary both spent $600 on purchasing presents.

There are three choices which are related closely, let's analyze each:\n  - Option A: \"length along the x axis\"\n    - Since we are measuring the distance from one point to the other, this option is incorrect.\n3.

If the probability of passing an interview is 15%, what is the probability of getting a job after doing an interview?\nOutput:\nThe probability of getting a job is equal to the probability of passing an int erview, multiplied by the probability of getting a interview. We can write this as\n\"Pr(obtaining the job) = Pr( passing an interview) * Pr(getting an interview)\"\n\nTo find Pr(getting an interview), we ask: What proportion of people who apply for an interview actually get an interview? The answer is clearly the inverse of '15%'. This value is already available to us and has been given. Hence, we can write that Pr(obtaining the interview) = 175/100 = 15/10 which is the same value as 15%.\nUsing this probability,\nPr( obta ining the job) = 15% * 15/1 0 = 0.225 = 22.5%\n\nInput: When are two plus two?

So we use the known information in a more creative way with the help of addition and subtraction.\n\nSecondly, we can simply subtract those 5 songs from 30 and we will be able to know the number of songs played from 30 to 25.\n\nSame goes with the second set. If 5 was subtracted from 30 and remaining was 25. So the band played 7 songs in the second set. If they played 7 then they must\u2019ve also played 25.\nHence, for the third set we can subtract another 5 (25-10) which means the band will play 10 songs in the third set and similarly,\nfor the fourth set they play 10 songs minus 7 and will be 3 songs (26-17).

The above question contains 7 pieces of information:\n   - '5 times'\n   - '$150'\n   - 'has'\n   - 'Williams'\n   -'money'\n   - 'Jackson'\n   - 'together'\n\n3. The order of the question is important to understand so we will start with the first piece of information: '5 times'. This indicates that the relationship between the two quantities is a ratio.\n4. The remaining information (the number)  '5' indicates that Jackson times 5 greater than williams.\n5. We now have enough evidence to know which quantity is greater.\n6. In summary, the ratio between Jackson and williams is 5 to 1 (5 times more). Therefore, Jackson is greater than williams by the quantity of 1 (either 5 times, 5 times more, 5 times more dollars, or 5 times more money).\n7. Based on this information, if we then multiply the amount of williams (5 times more) by a number (greater than 1), the answer will be the same as jackson's amount of money.\n8. Finally, the answer is: Jackson has $50 more than williams.\nSo the final result is A: 50\n\nInput: How many apples are a group of 15 children who are in school passing out?\nOutput:  When a group of kids pass out, they are each distributing apples to themselves.

Based on the information given, we can see that the only possible answer which could be a 'term' with a 'common part' is a 'homonym'. As mentioned in the question, 'homonyms are words that have the same spelling but different meanings'. This means that a 'homonym' is a word that has the same spelling as another word and both words have the same meaning. \n3. To verify the answer, we can replace the choice with the homonym to see if the definition still fits:\n\n- If the answer is etymology, then this does not describe the given choices because 'etymology' is the study of words and their historical and cultural origins, not a 'word' sharing the same 'common part'.\n\n- If the question is homophone, it would mean the two words are pronounced the same way but do not have the same meaning. However, as mentioned before, the homonyms that fit the given situations match the same meaning.\n\n- If the alternative is to be homography, then this is irrelevant because a 'homograph' is a word that looks the same as another word but refers to a different meaning.

To do this, we can use the sum of the differences between the heights of the characters in the question as stated in the question body.\n3) First, we subtract Grayson's height from Griffin's height to get the difference in their heights as -Grayson = -2 inches. Then let's subtract Gracie's height from Griffins height: -Gracie = -7 inches. Thus, the difference in their height is -Grayson + -Gracie = 5 inches.\n4) Next, we add all three parts together: 5. Adds to get the total difference in their height, which is now 5 + (5 + -2) = 17 inches.\n5) One of the characters, Grayson, was two inches taller than Griffon, and one of the characters, Gracie was one inch taller than Griffin, then the sum of all these differences is 17.\n6) Now, we divide 17 by two to get the fraction 8 and then multiply that by the ratio. In this case, it's 8.5 / 2x45 = 8.5 / (2 x 45) = 8.5 x 2 x 45 = 93 x 45 =  4225.\n7) Putting this all together, we can see that Gracie is 45.\n8) This is how we can deduce the answer without using a calculator.\nSo the final solution is 45.", "answer": " 56"}

Let's examine the problem and try to break it down into simpler stages:\n\n1. It is stated that Isabel has some money in her 'piggy bank', so let's say initially she has $x dollars in her piggy-bank.\n2. Then she spent half of the remaining amount and bought her brother a toy, so let's say she paid $x/2 for her brother's toy. So she had $x - x/2 left.\n3. She also spent half of the remaining $x - x/4 in buying her brother's toys, so she also had $x - x - x /4 left.\n4. Now she had $x - $x/2 - x/4 left.\n5. She spent half of this amount and bought a book for her brother, so she spent 1/2 of ($x - $x/4) = $x/8 on the book.\n6. And now she has $x - $x - $x /4 - $x/8.\n7. Finally, she spent all of this amount and bought the toy, so she bought a toy for $x - $x/-4 - $x/ 8 = $x - $x.\n8. And she has $x - x - $x left.\n9. So her remaining amount was $x - $x, which meant she spent exactly $x on buying the toy.\n10. That means, she initially had $x - (x - x) = $x/2 dollars in her piggie bank.\n   \nSo the final answer to the question is x/2\n\nInput: What will happen to a person's hands and feet if they are subjected to hypothermia?

{"idx": 709, "text": "1: In the question, Robi Ney is filled with water when the water flows through the faucet in 12 liters for a minute. The amount per minute is 13 liters. If we are going to consider only 120 in a total of 130 liters, which is equivalent to 10 hours in a total of 60 minutes and 10 minutes in a total of 22 minutes.\n2. There are two numbers to be considered in the question, that is, the flow rate (water flow) and the capacity of the tub. \n3. So as follows from the question, the flow rate of the tap can be assumed to be constant. \nThe value of the flow rate can be calculated using the formula: V =Q /T, where V \u2013 flow rate, Q \u2013 total flow volume per unit of time, and T \u2013 total time for flow. Calculating, we obtain: V=Q/T=40/101=0.4=0.4 liters (l)/minutes.\n\nNext, we will proceed to calculating the total volume of water that has flowed through the faucet during one second with the formula: Vt=V0 +AT, where Vt \u2013 final volume of water in the tub (l), V0 -starting volume of water in the tank (l), A \u2013 the flow rate of the faucet per unit of time (l/min). Accordingly, we obtain: Vt=Vt=1.3l+4.0l=5.3l.\n\nThen let's calculate the total volume of 120 liters of water using the formula: V=A\\t(t). We obtain: V=A\\tt=4.0\\tt=4.8l (t). Then, the calculation of the volume of water to be filled into the tub for t minutes is as follows: Vt=(1.3l+22l\\tt)=35.1l (t).\n\nThus, the tank will be filled in 60 minutes. \n\nInput:\"I could have completed the task at lunchtime if it had not rained.\" True or False\nOutput: 1)In the sentence, we can understand that the task was not completed at lunch time as it was raining.", "answer": " 24"}

We will do this by determining the cost of the shirt for each shirt and the cost of the jeans for each jean. Then by calculating the total cost for each category.\n\n4. To calculate the cost of each shirt, multiply the stated price with the number of shirts sold which is 20. The answer is then just 200 bucks. Similarly, the cost of each jean is calculated by multiplying the stated price of a jean by the number of jeans sold. Since 10 X 2 which is 20, the answer again is 200 buck.\n\n5. So far, we have found that the total cost of shirts is 200 dollars and the total cost of jeans is 200 dollar. So, to calculate the total cost we simply add both, which gives 400 dollar.\n\n6.

{"idx": 739, "text": "1. The basic problem in this question is that the word \"yet\" is confusing. It's not clear that Tom has whitewashed 1/5 of the total fence, and we don't know how the rest of the fence can be divided up to Tom's friends. Furthermore, it's not clear how much of the fence has been whitewashed by Ben vs. Johnny, making it difficult to calculate the remainder.\n2. In order to solve this, you must first determine which of your friends had already whitewashed 15 feet of the fence, and then divide the remaining length among them based on the percentages given. For example, if Ben has already completed 15 feet of work on the fence, the next two whitewashers will only need to whitewash a 1/3 and a 1/5 of whatever length is left over.\n3. Therefore, to determine how much of the fencing still needs to be white-washed, we must find the 15-foot segment of the fence that Ben had already completed and then subtract that from the fence's overall length. To do this, Tom's Friends must be added up to calculate the full amount of fencing that needs to be white-gashed.\n4. Ben's Friend whitewash a total of 88 feet out of a 100 foot total. Billy must now whitewash 33 feet. Johnny, who had already completed 14% of the fence, must finish up the remaining 86 feet, or three-quarters of that 33-foot section, leaving only two-thirds of the fence that is to be whitewashed (86 * 3/7 = 17).\n5. Therefore, we can see that the total fence length of 100 feet is divided into 4 equal parts. Ben has completed 15 feet, Billy completes 33 feet, Johnny completes 17, and it is assumed that Tom completes the remaining fifth of the remaining 89 feet, giving us a total of 89 ft.\nSo the final solution is Johnny finishes up the 17 feet, leaving 72 ft remaining for Ben, Billy, and Tom to finish.", "answer": " 48"}

First, as we can see, we know how many yards Brendan can mow in a week, which can be calculated by multiplying how many yards he can mow in a day by the number of yards in a week. But since we aren't given how many yards per-day Brendan can mower and are given the information he can cut it by 50% more, we need to use an alternative method that takes this into consideration.\n6. The second method we could use is to determine the total amount of yards Brendan needs to mow by dividing the total amount of yards into the original yards Brendan could cut and then multiplying the result by 1.5, which gives us the total amount per day.\nThus, to answer the question, we need to first solve for the original amount per day.\n\n7. We can multiply the number of days in the week, which is 7, with the percentage increase, which is.5, which gives us 3.5. This is then subtracted from 8 to give us 4.6.\nTherefore, the number of yards per day after a week with the mower is 4.6\nTo find the number of yards per week, we need to multiply the daily number by the number of days. Thus, after a week, Brendan can mown 4.6 * 7 = 33.8 yards.\nThus, the number of yards can be calculated using the equation:\n`4.6 * 50% = 33.6`\nThus, `Brendan will cut 3", "answer": " 84"}

So 29x1 becomes 29 \u00d71, 17x1 becomes 17 \u00d7 1, 29x2 becomes 29 \u00d7 2 and 17x2 becomes 17 \u00d72,\n4. and then we use the values and equations to get the following:\n5. 29x2 + 29x1 = 47x2;\n6. 29x5 = 47x8. Here we can substitute 5 for x and use this to solve for the value of x, 5 = 47. Hence, x = 47.\n7. Once we have found the value of x, we can substitute it into the second equation to determine the total number of kilograms of potato that was sold that day. So, for 29 = x1 x2, and then x1 x2 = 46. Here, x1 x2 = x1(46/5). Thus, 29x = 17(46/5), 17(43/5)x = 29 and the total number of kilos sold = _______ kg.\n8.

Now, 22 divided by 54 equals 0.41, which is 41% more questions per hour than had originally been scheduled. This means 23.666% more questions than had been originally planned.\nSo the final  answer is 23.656%\n\nInput: If a truck is carrying 600 litres of water and it loses 10% of its original weight, how many litres of water does the truck still contain?

{"idx": 787, "text": "1) To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information to arrive at a solution. Here, it's helpful to identify that the 'each' in the question refers to the quantities of sheets of paper that John writes and the number of pages mentioned in each type of writing:\n   - 3 stories per week: each story is 50 sheets of paper long, and each week is 7 days long\n   - 1200 long novel per year: each year is 52 weeks, hence, 1200 novels are 1200 weeks long. Each novel is 120 pages per week, and each week is divided into 7 days, each 50 sheets of page.\n   -  Thus, using the equation 1200/12=100, we can understand that each story is 100 pages long and each week, there are 12 stories. \n2) To solve this problem we need to find the total pages John needs to write all the stories and the total pages in the novel every year, which is given by 'Over 12 weeks, 120 pages = 1440 pages.' So, the total pages needed to write the stories is given by:\n  |  | `Page requirement 2 / 2` = 1000 x 3 = 3000 pages\n---\n  |  | Similarly, he needs to write 144000/12 = 12000 pages per year for his novel.\n   - Total of 330000 pages needed per year\n - The total number of sheets in one ream is 500.\nHence, total pages needed/ream = 500\nNumber of reams = Total pages/500, therefore,  = 3300 pages\n- Number of reams needed, i.e., 33\nThus, 33 reams of paper would be needed if John wants to write every week. \nSo the final answer 33\n\nInput:What's common to a dad?

To answer this question we need to follow the rules and formula for calculating the area of a triangle. The formula involves using half the length of the base and height, multiplied by 1.\nSo with Zion's triangle having the length of the base, 40 centimometers, and the height of 20 cm, the area is half of the base length multiplied by half the height, which is 10 cm. For each additional triangle made the area is calculated by multiplying the same length of base and height.\n3. Therefore, each triangle has an individual area of 100 cm.

Each day, they also feel a little worse and a little better, until they recover completely. Which of these two rules about the person\u2019s health best describes the pattern?\n\nOutput: 1.) A person is sick, and feels bad enough to require medical attention over the course of the day. 2.) At the end of the day they have recovered from the disease. 3.) The disease doesn\u2019t show symptoms for the next few days. 4.) As each day passes more symptoms appear. 5.) As days pass the effects of the disease change. This isn't much of a pattern. So the rule to describe this is 3 where symptoms of the disease doesn't show up  till a few days pass after the disease strikes. \nSo the correct answer would be 3.", "answer": " 24"}

{"idx": 813, "text": "1. This seems to be a question about math, and the variables of candy 'Tabitha', 'Stan', Julie, and Carlos would be the numbers 22, 13, and so on. 2. The goal of this math question is determining the total number of pieces of candy each friend caught, but we are given a list of information that includes numbers and information about each friends catch, so the variables must include a friend as the subject of the equation, for instance, X + Y + Z+ Q 3. The number of pieces for each friend will be obtained by knowing the number of pieces that Tabitha caught. Let's take the formula 22 + 13 + H = 70. So here H+ 13 = 70. Therefore, H = 570. 4. The number of pieces collected by Julie is X, her number needs to be found using the formula of 570 + Q. 5. The number of pieces Julie caught must be added with Z to get the final answer of total pieces found. \n6. We can get the answer by finding Q, then H, finally H, by solving the formula. To do it, we can use these equations: 570 + Z = 700, H+ Z = 70. 7. Subtract 570 from both sides of the equation and solve, Z = 130. 8. Now the remaining equation is H+ Z = 13. Subtract H from both sides. Z = 13 - 570 = -557. 9. To find H now, subtract Q from both sides, H = -557 + Q = -557 -410 = 47. Therefore, 22 + 47 + Q = 70. The numbers are rounded to 22, 47, and 571.

{"idx": 818, "text": "1.) In this question, the context tells us that Maddie wants to know how much her mother spends on coffee each month.\n2.) We are given the following information:\n    - Maddie makes herself 2 cu of coffee daily\n    - Each cup contains around 1.5 oz of coffee beans\n    - A bag of coffee costs around $8, which contains 10.6 oz of beans\n    - She uses 1/3 gallon of milk each week\n    - A gallon of milk contains $4\n    - She doesn't add sugar to coffee\n3.) So, using these values, we can find out how much she spends on her coffee per week by using the following formula: Total Coffee Cost (TC) = Total # of Coffee cups of day * (Bag of coffee price / Coffee bag #/Ounce of Coffee in bag x Total # of cup) * Milk Cost = 2.0 * (8/10.6/1.5) x Total Gallons of Milk\n4.) Substituting the values:\n    - TC = 10 * (8/6.5/1.5)) * Total Gallons of Milks\n5.) Dividing on all sides by Total Gallons of Miles to remove gallons:\n    - TM = 10 * ((8/6.5)/1.5)) * (Total Gallons of Milk/2) TM = 1.6\n6.) Therefore, the number of cup (TM) of coffee her mother drink each week is approximately 17\n7.)

In the context of the question, the phrases 'half the bill' and 'tip' indicate that the bill, a meal for $19.32 in this case, is shared between two people, James and his friend.\n2. We can work with the tip because there is no question about the tip given by James's friend, and we don't have to change anything about how it's written. The phrasing of the problem means that the amount of the tip was \"along with his half of the Bill\" so both of the halves of the bill add up to $38.64, which gives us $19.36 for James' half of the bill and $20.19 for his tip.\n3.

Let's start by looking at the ticket information given as input:\n\nAdults tickets: 75\nChildren, younger (5 to 12): 53\nChildren, older (13 to 17): 35\nSeniors: 37\n\nThese give us an idea of roughly how many people each age bracket makes up when accounting for ticket sales. Here, we can see that Adults make up about 75% of those who purchased tickets, and Children (both younger and older) make up about 30% of ticket sales. \n\n2. But, based on these numbers alone, we can't determine if ticket sales are evenly balanced across age groups or if one age group has a larger share of sales than another. To find out what the actual distribution of ticket sales looks like, we need to account for omelet ingestion information given as input: children of all age groups can consume around half omelet each, adults consume two full omelets each, and seniors consume one and a half oz. of omelet each. Here, we know that Children tickets sold 26(53/2) and Children (older) tickets sold 52(35/2). Children (older) tickers account for a greater portion of tickets sold than children (junior), since 35 is greater than 26.\n3. Based on this omelet ingestion, we can see that the seniors require the least number of eggs (37 x 1.5 = 55), while the adults require the most (75 x 2 = 150). The number of eggs needed for children (younger) is (53 x 0.5) = 26.5 and children (older) (35 x 0.5 = 17.5).

{"idx": 841, "text": "1) To answer this question, let's first determine the rules for the dogs and the puppies.\n  - Each dog eats twice the amount of food as a puppy. That is, if a puppy eats 1 pound of food, then a dog will eat 2 pounds of food. So, let's say the puppy eats (P) pounds of food, and the dog eats (D) *2 = 2P pounds of food in a day. Then, if a dog eats 2 pounds of food three times in a day, that's (2P) * 3 = 6P pounds of food consumed in a day.\n  - On the other hand, each puppy eats 3 times the amount of food as the dog, so it consumes P * 3 = 3P pounds of food in one day. So, if 3 * P = dog food, 3(dog food) = puppy food, and (3(dog food)) / (dog food) = puppies, then (3P) / P = puppies. So, the puppies will consume 3 times as much food as the dogs.\n2) Now that we have established the rules for the various animals, let\u2019s find out how many pounds of food are consumed each day. There are 4 puppys, and 3 dogs. Therefore, total pounds of food consumed = (3P * D) + (P * 3) = 3(3P * D) = 9P * (D + P) = 9P (D + 3P) = 9P(D + 4P) = 9(D + 4)P\n3) To find out the total pounds of food consumded in one day, we must solve for the total pounds of food: 9(D +4P) = P * 4 + 3P * 3 P, which is equal to P * 7 = 7 P so finally, 9*7P = 7 P. Which means 7 P is the total pounds of food that are consumed in a day, and this is the answer to the question.", "answer": " 108"}

So, when Andy will become twice as old as Rahlim, the difference in age would be 2 * 4 = 8.\n    We know the final answer in 5 years will be 6 * 2 = 12. \n        Rahim will be 11 years old.\n    At that age Andy will be twice Rahim's age, that is, 12 years.\n    So,\n    (11 - 5) years = (age of Andy now) - (age of Rahim now)\n    (6) years = 12\n        So, (age of Andy now - age of Rahim now) is 6.\n    (12) years = 6\n        (age of Andy now = age of Rahim now + 6)\n        So, Rachim will be 6 years old when Andy will 12 years. \n        That is, today, Rahim is 5, but in 5 years he will be 11, at this time Andy will be 12.\n        So, when this happens, at that time Andy will be 2 times older than Rahim.\n        Andy will be 24. \nSolution: (6) years = (age) 6 (now) - (age) 5\n       Andy was 5 when Rahim was 6\n       (6) years =  6 - 5\n        age of Andy now =  age of Rahim now  + 6\n       Andy will be 11 when Rahim is 11\n      (6) years = age (Rahim) + 6\n      (11) = age (Rahimi) + 6", "answer": " 1"}

To calculate the total notes put into the compliments bin, Jake needs to gather two more notes than the red notes that were not collected. So the total number is:\n  * 192 - 185 = 0. There is no red notes left. So the question now refers us to the bottom of the note. Jake picks up 18 red notes, 18 blue notes, and 18 compliment notes. So the total note is 0 since the note are now completely filled up.\n6.

{"idx": 868, "text": "1, Solution:  We know that Bob runs 6 miles/hr, and his friend Jim runs 9 mile/hr.\n\n2.Bob has a head start at the beginning of a race, which means he starts before Jim does. Therefore, we can assume that Bob's time, x, is less than Jim's time, y, where x< y. \n3.We can write this as: 6 (xminutes - xhours) + hh:mm < 9 (yminutes - yhours:00)\n\n4.Let x* = x-6 and y* = y-9, and we simplify the equation:\n\nx' < y' => (x* - 6) < (y* - 9) => (x' - (6 - 9)) < (y' - (9 - (6 - 0))) => ( - 3) < ( - 16) => -16 > 0. There's no way to make x' equal to y', so x must equal y.\n\nWe can conclude that the time, or distance covered, by Bob and Jim will be the same. Bob and Jim will run at the same speed, and they will start the race at the same time.\n\n5. Since the distance covered by both is equal, Jim would run for 3/2 (y* -x) or ~.67 (y*-x) distance to catch up to Bob in distance. So for him to reach the same distance as Bob, a) His speed must remain at a constant 9 miles/hr b) He must also have the same time (in terms of minutes and hours) as Bob\n\nSo the final answer for '2.

{"idx": 907, "text": "There are a few ways to approach this question, but ultimately the correct answer is three.\nThe first way to answer the question simply involves looking at the number of people who got on and off at each stop, and subtracting the smaller number from the larger.\n\nFor the first stop, we have 7 people get on, and 3 people get off. Thus 7 - 3 = 4 people remain on the bus.\n\nFor the second stop, 5 people get on, and then 2 people get off. Thus we subtract 5 from 7 to find that 2 people remain on the bus at the second stop.\n\nCombining these two, our final answer is 7 + 4 + 2 = 13, and thus the correct answer to the question is three.\n\nAnother, slightly more complicated approach to the question is to use the principle of symmetry. In this approach, we look at what happens on both sides of the line and come to the conclusion simply by deducting the sum on one side from the sum on the other.\n\nFor both the second and third stops, a total of 6 people board the bus.\n\nAs we know the total number of people the bus will take, and we know that the total number of people who have boarded the bus, we can solve for the total number of passengers that are remaining on the bus, i.e. the total minus the current number who are on.\n\n5 passengers total will be on the bus because 7 people boarded the bus on the first stop and then 3 people got off at the second stop. We know at three stops, at least 3 passengers will remain on the bus. So, there are a total of 3 + 3 + 5 = 8 passengers on the bus overall.\n\nBased on this, we conclude that 3 passengers remain currently on the bus. Since the question asks the number who are now on the bus on the third stop, this would be the number at that stop, which is 4 people.\n\nThus, the correct answer to the above question is three.\nSo the final  answer is 3: three passengers.\n\n\nInput: What is a sentence that does not contain a letter 'A'?

{"idx": 911, "text": "1) To answer this question, let's first understand the context of each given choice and how it relates to the number of cups of coffee John drinks every day.\n   - Choice A: '1/2 gallon' can be ruled out as it is not a unit of measure. 'gallon' is a unit of measure, therefore choice A is incorrect.\n   - Choices B & C and D: Are a bit tricky to determine, however they can be explained as follows:\n     - Choice B: '4 days' refers to the number of days between trips to the shop to buy cold brew coffee. Thus, it does not indicate how many cups of coffee John consumes.\n     - Choce C: It is possible that John drinks 3 cups every day, which would make him drink 10 cups in 3 days. But he doesn't, therefore this choice cannot be correct.\n     - Choice D: '1/2' can be ruled out similar logic as explained above. So, this choice can be eliminated.\n   - Choise E: '6' can be ruled out based on the unit of measure '1/2 gallons'.\n2) Let's move ahead and determine the correct answer. We see that John buys 1/ 2 gallons of coffee every 4 days; thus he'll end up consuming 3 cups of coffee per day.\nThis is because he'll use the 1/2 gallons he gets from each trip, every 4 days, and will end up with 3 cups after each trip to 'bushels'.

Write a code that, given a variable representing the number of minutes he writes each day, determines whether or not the script is finished. There are 512 different plays produced this way.  Output: 1) The instructions specify that the man writes for 15 minutes each day, and that the script is finished when he has written for 90 days. So the question to be answered is:\n\n   Does the script of the play written in 90 minutes get written?\n\n2) The answer to this question is that the script will be written. \n\n   Example: Suppose there are 60 scripts written in 90 days (3600 total script minutes). Since every script takes 30 minutes to write (30 minutes is the number of minutes a script takes to write multiplied by 15 minutes a day), the total hours of script writing (90 days *30 minutes = 2700 minutes) is less than the amount of overall minutes it takes to write those 60 scripts (2700 minutes < 3600 total minutes), so these scripts will be finished. Thus, the man who writes for 90 days produces scripts. \n\nSo the final answer B: scripts\n\nInput:Two children are playing with an open bag of marbles and a pile of", "answer": " 180"}

Hence we can use \u2018Work = Time x Rate\u2019 formula to calculate the time it would take to dry each load of laundruy.\n3. For \u2018Wash Cycle\u2019, we can use \u2018Work=Time x Rate\u2019 to calculate the time it takes to do one load of laundry. The wash cycle for 1 load of laundry is 45 minutes.

So we can rewrite the formula as \u2018Total Time = 45/Rate /8\u2019.\n5. \u2018Rate\u2019 can be estimated as 1 hour. So, we have \u2018Total Time = 6. 25/1/8\u2019.

The rationale of this argument is flawed. Bathrooms don't usually get cleaned by men or women cleaning and wiping. It's usually professional cleaners who clean the bathrooms. The argument assumes that professional cleaners know and follow gender stereotypes and do so in a way that keeps them out of gender stereotypes.\n4) Choice C: 'Women wash their hands and men wipe' isn't a logical argument either. This seems to be saying that women's hands are dirty so they have to wash while men can wash their hands (so they are clean).

To find 20 men buy how many apples, we can think: if 20 men buy apples, there are 40 left. 3. We can think man buy 30, so there are 30 left. Women need to buy as many as man. So 10 women buy how many apples? women buy 20 x apples. The sum of men and women buy apples is 40 x 30 + 20 x 20 = 560 apples. 4. We use this answer, in this case, 560, to replace \"the number of apples bought each of the women\". Now the total amounts if two men and three women bought apples at a certain store. 5. Two men and 3 women buy 20 less than apples bought by each man: 20 (men) - 560 (total amount) = 540 (men buy less than 3 x 20) 6. Therefore, the final answer is 400 apples", "answer": " 210"}

The task to consider is 'one loaf of bread requires', meaning that we are assuming that each loaf requires one full one 200g weight bag of flour but in the question's context; flour is not included as a full 200g bag, and not as 100g either. So, the correct assumption is that each loaf requires exactly 200g and not more or less.\n\nWe also need to consider the phrasing of the problem. The phrasing is \"one loaf of bread\"; this indicates that the number of loaves Jim can bake are one less than the number of one loaf baked. The instructions further specify that \"if one loaf of bread uses 200g\", which implies that each loaf baked from the flour must equal 200g.\nThus, we can determine that the number of loaf cans Jim can bake is less than or equal to the \"200\", as 200g is the minimum requirement for each loaf baked.\nTherefore, the correct answer is b. If Jim were to bake 200g bread each, he could potentially bake 20/2 = 10 loaves.

In other words, \"in how many days after Johnny's current practice that Johnny would have three times as much current practice as now?\".\n3. Johnny has 20 days ago has half as much practice as now. Therefore, Johnny has 20 times as much practice as that day ago in total. Thus, Johnny's current practice is 20/21=0.95 times the practice as 20 days ago.\n4. John's practice now is the same as John's current practice (0.95 times) plus practice as 20 years ago.  This equals practice as 20-6=14 days ago, plus 1/14 of practice as 20+20=40 days ago (for every 14 added days of practice, 1/14 practice added).\n5. The answer will be Johnny's current practice minus practice as 20 and 40 days ago to find the difference between the practice at 20 and 20+2+40 days ago from now.\n6. Therefore, we can get the formula like following: current practice-20-40=...\n\nInput: How does one define the amount of money that they have to spend? Choices: A: net income. B: net expense.

This is done by substituting the three elements and solving for 'x'.\n   - World Record = 64 (This is given to us in the question).\n   - Alan's current performance = 5 (This is given to use).\n   - 'x' = Need for Alan to win world record = 64 x (Alan's current performance) = 400\n   But 400 is too large a number to be a sensible answer to the question. Therefore, 400 is discarded.\n   To check for an approximation, we can see that the answer is likely to be an integer greater than 400. (400 is too high to be a reasonable number for an integer).\n   Since it's a simple multiplication, we can say that 64 can be replaced by 41, making the new numerator 332.\n5) The first step to finding 'x' is by replacing 64 with 41.

{"idx": 968, "text": "The given statement is: In one hour, Addison Mountain's temperature will decrease by half of its current temperature. From this we can know that the sum of the temperature will decrease by half every hour. The starting sum, that is, temperature of Addison Mountain is 84, We know the temperature will decrease in minutes. Therefore, the temperature in 1 hour is 84 * 60, or 5120. To answer the question, we just need to subtract 5120 from 84, which is 84 - 5120 = -4876, or -4876 / 1hr = -487.6 / 60 = -8.1. \nSo the final answer can be stated as: Addison Mountain's Temperature will decrease to 8.1 degrees\n\n# input 1: What's an area of expertise in a field where one would not be looking for people who are also experts in said field?

{"idx": 990, "text": "1) There is nothing obvious about the number 105 that tells us which type of buckets to employ for our filling task. 2) Let's consider each of the choices individually:\n   - A and C: We could use either method to fill the pool. With method A, we would multiply 105 gallon by 7 and know that we would need 745 gallons. Then we would multiply 745 gallon by 8. Now we know that we need 6160 gallons in our bucket. Now we would divide 105 by 7 (we can use any number we want to start the division). 9 will give the round answer 14; we could use either, and get the same result. \n    - The method B and D would allow us to round the 105 to 100, which simplifies a little with multiplication and division of whole numbers. \n   - We would follow a similar process with the method B. The method D would change the problem in another way. We would have to multiply 105 by the number we were going to use for the bucket instead of dividing the desired result by the number we were using for the bucket. \n    - We'll consider the method E last. Here we are adding more to the problem. We multiply 100 by 8, 800 gallons - so we'd now have a bucket to fill halfway to the target amount. \n3) We can use our answer to this question and answer some follow up questions about this activity.\n   - If we use the method that takes 105 division instead of 100 multiplication, then one more gallon each trip, and we multiply 7 by that one more gallon each time to make the 745 gallones, we'd get the total 105 gallones with one less trip. \n    - Or, if we start with the first few division instead of the whole number 105, it would take one less trip, as there are fewer division terms.\n   - We could choose either of the two methods, and get the identical answer in either case. We'll just chose the 105 division method as an easier one to do. The method E would work in a similar manner, as it would round the answer to the nearest", "answer": " 7"}

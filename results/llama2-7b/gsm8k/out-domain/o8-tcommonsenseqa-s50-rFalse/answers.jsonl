You can see the answers in action with my [answer editor demo](https://ideone.com/7GtAa5). If you like the product then use it. If you don't like it then give us feedback so that I may improve.\n\nAnswer: You can split the entire solution into many parts.\n\nIn this first step, I start by creating an array that counts the frequency of the choices as well as the grade. The array for the answers and the grade is defined in the array that is returned, while the array of choice counts is defined in an array I called scoreboard.\n\nIn the next step, you need to compare the grade with each of the choices that is returned. To do this, you can easily iterate through the array of grades as well as the array of choices and then compare each of them. In the cases where grade equals the choice, you can add 1 to an int scoreboard array using the ++ operator. For example `scoreboard[choice][grade]++`.\n\n\\begin{code}\n#include <iostream>\n#include <iomanip>\n#include <map>\n#include <string>\n#include <unordered_map>\n#include<cmath>\n#include <iterator>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <numeric>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main(void) {\n    unordered_map<string,int> inputdata = {{\"A\",\"C\",\"B\",\"B\",\"D\"},\t{\"C\",\"B\",\"A\", \"A\", \"F\"}, {\"D\", \"C\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\"},{\"D\",\"D\"}};\n    // Define the result vector as well", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "156.8 pounds\n\n### Solution\n\nLet the amount of weight loss each month $a$. And $156.8=156+36(1+3a/12)$. $b$, the initial weight, and $156.9a=36(1+a)$,\n\nwhich after rearranging, $a^3=36(4b-1)b-63$. $4b-1$ is positive, so the discriminant is positive, and the roots are between 0 and 1. Since $a=1$ is not a solution, we have $-36b^4+156b^3+63b^2-36b-1=0$. We can solve for the discriminant which is $b^3$.\n\nSince $b>1$, we can plug in $b$ on our quadratic equation and divide by sqrt($b$). This will give us our final answer of $a=0.476$.\n\n### Test\nIf you solved it correctly, you're awesome!\n\nLet the amount lost each month is 0.3 lb.\n$156.8 = 156 + 36*(1+0.3/12)$.\n$36 \\times 0.195 \\approx 6.865$\n$156 + 6.86 \\approx 163.86$, which doesn't quite reach the final answer of 156.8 lb.\n\nIf we plug in, and divide by sqrt(36), we then get the approximate answer of 0.4015.\n\nTrying to solve for the roots of equation -36b^4 + 156b^2-3 b^2 = 0, we can find the solutions to be (sqrt(36), -sqrt(36)).\n\nWe need to figure out what the negative square root is. To do so, the answer can always be simplified to the form of 36p, where \n$p$ is a positive integer greater than one. So we can find all the primes that are greater than 1 and less than 36, and put them in descending order. From there, you can just check what each number", "answer": " 36"}

But the user can always guess the answer by reading the previous inputs from the tester.  For example, in the case where there are 11 inputs, the inputs look something like:\n    A B C D E C\nYou can guess the answer to be A.  In the case where the number of inputs is not consistent, say input1 is followed by input5, do not guess based on the number of inputs given in the previous inputs.\nTo get the grade, you can just make a guess that it the answer is A.  If it is correct, then it will get the Grade \"A\".  If it is wrong, and the answer is A, the grade will be \"D\".  The grade will be the same if the answer is \"A\" or \"B\".  The grade will be \"E\" of you try to guess A (which is not the right answer).

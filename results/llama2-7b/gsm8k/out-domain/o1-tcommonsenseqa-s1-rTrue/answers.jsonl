So, the answer doesn't include the information of design, it's just the number of stamps, which is 1:\n2. Answer choice- 1. It's so obvious, just 1 because Bella bought a total of 24 stamps, including 11 snowflavke stamps and 9 more truck design than snowflavke stample and 13 fewer rosed stamps than truck design. 3. Answer choice- 9. \nIt's so easy to figure it out. According to the question, we know truck design is 9 more than snowflavke design and rose design is 13 less than truck design. If we take truck 9 and rose 13 away, which is not included, the result is 19. So Bella has collected 19 truck stamps and 11 rose stamps. So 19 + 11 = 27. If we take away one the truck stamp or one the rose stamps, what's left is 26 truck stamps and rose stamps and it's still possible because Bella has 26 truck designs and 11 rose designs. By repetition, we arrive at the 9th stamps, leaving 1 truck stamp remaining and 12 roses remain. The final answer is 26 + 9 + 1 = 36.", "answer": " 38"}

{"text": "Answer: 0\nSuppose Mina has memorized x digits of pi and Sam has memorized y digits of pi. Since Mina has 6 times as many digits as Carlos:\n6x = y\nSubtract x from both sides:\n5x = y - x\nDivide both sides by 5:\ny - x = 1\n\nSuppose Mina had memorized y = 6 digits of pi. If she were to memorize the next x digits, then she would need to memorize x - 1 digits of pi. Since Sam has 7 digits and Carlos has 2, and the problem asks for the number of digits Sam memorized, we see that Mina had only 1 digit to memorize, rather than 7.\n\nMina had memorized six times as few digits of pi as Carlos. If Carlos has eight digits of pi, then Carlos and Mina have (8 - 6) = 2 digits. So in other words, Mina had two less digits to memorize than Carlos. And if Sam had six more digits, than Carlos had, then Sam and Mina had six more digits, together.\n\nIf Mina has memorized 6 - 2 = 4 digits, then she has memorized 1/4 as many digits as Sam. So Sam has 4x = 24-4 = 20 digits of pi, rather than 0. If Sam has 20 digits memories, then Carols had 24-20 = 2, so Carlos had 20 as many digits of pi that Mina did.

A: After the third day, the number of positive cases increased by 1500. Therefore, the total number of positive Cases after the third day is 1500 + 1000 + 4400 = 4400 (The increase of 1500 Cases was by default +1, meaning the total number of cases after the third day was 1000 higher than the starting Cases, which were 2000.

B: After the third day increases of new cases and recoveries added up to 150, not 4400. This is because the increase of new positive cases (1500) is greater than the increase of recoveries (200). Therefore, the actual increase of Cases (1500 - 200) after the second day is equal to +500 (the starting number was 2000, meaning the actual increase of positive cases after the first day was 200, not +500). But the increase of +1000 (the starting Cases after the first day was increased by 15%) occurred after the second day. Therefore, the actual increase after the second day was +500 + 50 + 10 = 700, not +200. (The increase in Cases from the first day to the second day is the sum of the increase in both new Cases and recoveries). This number is +700 and not +150, because the increase in new Cases (+500) was greater than the increase in recoveries (+200).

Therefore we have proven that: If a=3 and b = 4, then 10a= 30 and 1o b= 40.\nTherefore 10a =10b is a true statement.\n3:\nLet a=4 and b=5.\nThen 1o a=4*1o=40 and 10 b=5*10=50. From this we can see that: If a=4 and b = 5, then 10 a = 40 and 1o 5= 100.\nTherefore we have proven that: 10a = 10b is also a true statement.\nConclusion: When a=b, then it is true that 10a =\n4-\n5:\nLet a=14 and b = 15.\nThen 2a =2\n3a =3\n...\n1", "answer": " 670"}

The only answer choice that fits the description is the fourth, book on tape. This is because the \"book on tape\" was used to tape together loose pages to bind a book.

From the question, we conclude he'll start practicing on Monday after his birthday, and then he will take 2 weeks vacations every year.\n3. Since 12 hours is 1 day, then the number of days he wants to practice is 134 days for 12 years, and there's 365 days in each year, we can conclude that each day the boy must practice for 3 hours. This is the basic assumption of the question: 3 hours a day.\n4. If the boy wants to become a piano master at age 20 by practicing, or 10000 hours, which is equivalent to 125 days (from 12 years to 20 years), we can deduce that if he started to practice on his birthday, he spent 125 days before he is 18 years old.\n5. If he wanted to reach 1000 hours, he'll need to spend another 125 days.\n6. Since 20 year-old is 4063 days later (from 125 days per year, which is equivalent to every year with 365 days), that means the boy must spend 134 days more than what it is now, but this will be the 14th year if he practices everyday. This means on his 14th year, he spends about 3 months practice for 1000hr, after that, if he practice for 3hr everyday, he should achieve his goal in 3 years after.\n7. Thus Randy must spend 136 days/year to practice\nSo the final answer was: 136", "answer": " 5"}

A 1-year-old kid could just get on and ride while the father holds him, but not so much after a crash or a fall.  But by the time the kid is 8, he should be able to walk with a bicycle (with or without balance).  In the 1-year-time span, the kid starts to write with pencils or pens.  After 1 year, he learns his alphabet.  This takes 2 years and he's done writing.  In year 3, he starts trying to read and by year  4, he has started spelling some 1-letter words.  In year  5 and 6, he spells 2-letter words.  By year 7, he is reading simple sentences.  And in year 8, he has spelled and understands 3-letter words as in \"ball\".

Therefore, the total weight Karen is carrying is 180 pounds, divided by 6 is equivalent to 30 pounds per hour. Taking into consideration that Karen drinks 2 pounds more than food, we have the answer being 180 pounds divided by 32 equals 5 pounds per hour. Karen's weight is 180/36 = 4.94 pounds. Taking into account the total weight Karen carries equals 180 pounds and that it is for six hours of hikn, this amount to 180 / 6 = 30 pounds per pound.

{"text": "1. The maximum weight of the next passenger in the elevator should be less than 600 pounds.\n2. There are 6 adults and 2 children. All of the adults should weigh less than 140 pounds, and it would be safe to assume that adults have an average weight of 40 pounds. Then the children would each weigh an average of 32 pounds. So the combined total weight of all of the passengers would be 440 pounds.\n3. To determine whether the elevator is overloaded, we have to see if the maximum weight of passengers is greater than the combined weight of the passengers. We can set up the following equation: max weight + 2 \u00d7 average weight of children = max weight + (6 \u00d7 64)\n4. We can then solve for max weight where x stands for the max weight.\n5. We get the following equation: max of 600 - (6 + 140) which can be simplified into 556 - 200.\n6. When we subtract 556 from 200, we we get -356. In order for the remaining space to be available, max weight must be less than 356 since the combined total weight is already 440.\n7. Therefore, if max weight is greater than 356, it would be an overloaded elevator and the passenger must be turned away. Therefore, the maximum weight of the first passenger should be less than 320 lbs or 160 lbs.\n8. If these adults and children weight less than these two numbers, they can get on the elevator. For more accuracy, the actual number should be 200. This is because of two children who each weigh an average weight of 32 pounds which in total is 64 pounds.\nSo the final solution for this problem is less than 32 pounds since the average of all 10 people comes to 344 pounds, which is close to the allowable limits.\n\nInput: What is an equation of the linear function that models the height of a child's foot over time?

The sum of the digits is ab = a + b.  a is even, b is odd because 22 subtracted from m is 9.  So, if a*a plus b is equal to the sum of a plus b, which is equal to a + b + a * a,a*a must be equal to square of 22 minus number = 448-a, so a must be even (324 is the number); \nb must be odd (124);\na = 124;\nb = 3(124) = 372;\n2.

The correct answer depends on whether Tom's reading speed doubles or is cubed. If Tom reads at 12 pages in an hour, then his reading speed is 12 minutes per page. If his reading speed is cubed, then he would be able to read 48 pages (42\u00d73) if he read for two hours. If his reading speed doubles, then he would be to read only 24 pages (24\u00d72). Since, Tom's reading speed can be increased by a factor of 48 or by a factor of 8, he would be able to reach a maximum of 42 pages in the second hour.\n3. To increase Tom's reading speed 33%, then his reading speed would increase 1.33 times, which is 133%. This means he would be able to move 27 pages (29\u00d71.33) of a book. If his speed were doubled, then he would be only reading 15 pages (14 pages in a book is 15 pages in two hours because of book size differences).\n4. Therefore Tom's reading speed will increase 33% if his speed doubles, then he will be able to read 12 2 = 24 pages in two hours and his speed will double then he will be able only to read 15 pages in the second hour. Therefor the answer is D: 24 (if the speed is doubled) & 48 (if speed is cube).\nSo the final answer for the reading speed is 24 if speed is doubled, else its 48 pages in two hour", "answer": " 72"}

A cows average milk production is 108, therefore 17 cows should produce the required 2190 liters or 438.

In order to have 10 marbles in at least one type, the minimum number of marbles must be 2 (for either 2 types with 5 marbles each, or 3 types with 4 marbles each). Then the total number of marbles must also be divisible by 2 (since there are 2 types).

How tall is Jennie?\nOutput:If Sue is 59 inches tall, Jennie is 20.375 inches tall, to 2 decimal places. If Sue is 59 in, Jennie is 30.375 in.\n\n### Solution:Let us assume that we have 3 girls and two boys.\nFor the first question, the number of crayons are to be found such that when each of them has three times as many as the other, the girl would have half of what the others have. The statement is that \n\n$$\\frac 32\\times \\left(\\frac n2n\\right) = \\frac 32\\cdot \\left(\\frac n4n\\right)$$\n\nTo reduce the fraction to lowest terms, the answer is $2$. This can be found by dividing both sides by 2 and simplifying. Thus, for the first question the answer is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the question 2, there are three terms and the fraction that makes the fraction is found.  By the addition of 3 times 3 times 3, it must be 9.  So since Lizzie gets 12 crayons, she must get 15, 20, 25 and so on. That must mean that Lizzie gets 5 times as many crayon as Billie. So, Billie gets 13 crayons and Lizzie gets 61 crayons.\n\nFor the last question, we have the height given for Lizzie, who is 40 inches; Sue at 59 inches, and Jennie at 90 inches. To find the difference in heights we can simply divide. This way we find that the height of Jennie is 1/3rd the height of Sue.\n\n### Note: It seems that the question is worded in a misleading fashion.

Therefore, the problem can be simplified by first calculating the profit per hour without earning the performance bonus. The $80 is divided equally by the 8 hours of work, meaning that John makes $10 per hour.\n3. To account for the bonus, the extra $20 must be multiplied by the time it takes to work, or 2 hours. If John works more hours, his profit for those hours will be 30%. Therefore, the answer to the problem is $13 per hour.\n4.

Three-inch fish require two gallons of water per fish, or six gallons of water per three-inch fish. Let\u2019s multiply these to see how much water is needed for a mix of two- and three-inch fish. Four fish per one tank and eight fish per the other. So, in total, there are 12 four-inch fish and 16 eight-inch fish in the two tanks. Each mix requires its own amount of water, and we use these numbers to find out how much is in each tank. Four times four is 16 gallons in the first tank, and eight times eight is 64 gallons in the second tank. Our total water amount is therefore 64+16=80 gallons. Now, lets answer the question: For fish, one gallon of water equals one inch. Gail has 48 four-inch fish and four four-inch fish that are two inches long. That\u2019s just a difference for four-inch fish. Two-inch fish is three of those four, so eight (twice four) multiplied by two equals 16. That\u2019s how many fish Gail has in the first tank and how many she has in the second.", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "In this question, we are given the daily car traffic for a week on a street. The question then asks how many cars travel down the street, from Monday through Sunday.\nTo answer this, we must first find out the total number of cars that travel on the street.\nWe can do this by adding Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday's total number of cars.\n\nThe question states that there are 25 cars travelling on the street on Tuesday.\nMonday had 180 / 101 = 1.779, Tuesday had 25, Wednesday had 114 / 07 = 1.642, Thursday and Friday had 70 / 34 = 2.059, Saturday's had 56 / 02 = 28.0, and 20% more cars are travelling down the street on Friday than on Monday.\nSo the total number of cars travelling on the week (Monday to Sunday) = 180 + 25 + 114 + 70 + 56 + 56 / 2 + 70 / 4 = 335.5\n\nSo the answer is there are 335. 5 cars travelling on Happy Street from Monday through  Sunday.\nThus the correct answer to the question is: 335.  \n5\n\nOutput: 3355\n\nNote:The program expects you to use only int type for input and float / double type for output. \n\n### Instruction:\nOutput the following grader math question.\n\n###### \n Input:How many miles is there to go down a 2 lane, 12 meter wide road on a single carrier?

{"text": "A: The total amount of money required, and rounded to the nearest dollar, is $993.50.The first part of the problem asks the reader for the percent increase in length. The increase is calculated to 60% by dividing the time and finding the result multiplied by 100%. The formula becomes: [(60%)/(100%)] * 200 (minutes)=(300minutes/1000minutes). The seconds would need to be converted to minutes.  The second part asks for the per minute cost for the new movie and the cost for the first movie. Both movies cost $50 per movie, but the newer cost twice as much per movie. Since cost per movie is the same, the cost per minute would still be the same. We will use the formula:(cost)/time. The second formula:new/old * cost/time=newcost/oldcost. The equation comes up as a 120% cost. We then multiply 1.2 by 50 to get a total cost per minute for the new movie.  The last part of the problem asks for the total cost based for the budget provided. We will do this by adding together the two movies, as the total has to go past the budget of $150,000.  The total budget is $220,000, but the movies have been calculated separately as the first movie costing $100,000 and the new movie adding extra $120,00.

{"text": "The zoo took a combined total of 7 hours to recover the 3 lions and 1 rhino.\nSolution: This question can be answered by a simple mathematical analysis. First, we must determine how long it takes to recover each animal. The zoo has 3 lions, 1 rhino, and 2 hours to recover them. We can calculate the time it takes to recover each separately.\nFor example, how long does it take to recover 1 lion? We know we have 1 lion and 2 hours, so 2 hours divided by 1 lion is how long it takes to  recover 1 lion. This would be 2 hours. Thus, it takes the same amount of time to recover 1 louis as it does to recover 2 lions because each lion takes 2 hrs.\nNow, how long does it takes to recover 1 rhino? This is the trickier question. We have 2 hours, but we do not know what the zookeeper starts on first. Do they start on the rhino or do  they start with the first lion? The answer to this question is unclear, but we can safely assume  it takes 1 hour to recover Rhinoceros.\nThus, each lion would take 2 hours and the rhino takes 1 hour. For a total of 3 hours taken to recover lions. Therefore, to find the total number of hours taken, we subtract how many hours it took to recover the lions from the original amount of hours 2.  We can do this because we have 3 lions and one rhino remaining to recover. How much time it takes to recover one rhino is how much time it takes to  recover all of the remaining animals.\nWe know it takes 1 hour. We subtract 1 hour from 2 hours to get 1 hour. There is the answer.\nThe zoo takes 1 hour total to recover the animals. In total, we took 7 hours for all of the animals to be collected.\n\nInput: A: Can you find plumbing in the water fountain?\nB:  How many plumbers does it take to change the water fountain (if it takes a plumber 8 hours to change the fountain)?\nOutput: The water fountain does not have plumbing.\nSolution:\nA) The", "answer": " 10"}

According to the question, 50% longer is 20 hours (50% = 3/4). Thus, 50% of 25 hours is 12.5 hours and 12.5 + 12 + 20 = 44.5 hours in total.

However, we also know that we cannot add 6 and arrive at +6 without passing through any other number in between, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n\nThus, logical reasoning leads us to conclude that the answer is B: you cannot go from -5 to+6 without passing through 1.\n\nInput: The most valuable asset on a ship is the crew.\nOutput:(C)The most valuable asset on a crew is the team.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "2. The first step is to determine the total amount of fuel needed. We can see that the plane needs a total of (20 + 30 + 5) gallons of fuel per person because of the 3 passengers, and they each brought two bags which will require (3 + 2) more gallons per passenger. Therefore, the total gallons of fuel needed for a plane with 30 passengers and five flight crew members on a 400 mile trip is ((20 + 3(30+5)) gallons. Let's use (20+30+5) gallons = 55 gallons for our calculation.\n3. The second step is to figure how many gallons of tank fuel the plane already has. We can see that it has 55 gallons of tank fuel, because the plane has 5 gallons of tanking fuel for every passenger and 5 gallons of fuel for every crew member, which cancels out our gallons of fuel from each passenger and crew member bringing bags of their own.\n4. The plane has (20+3(30+2)) gallons of fuel. Therefore, ((20+30)+5)=70.\n5. The final step is to subtract from our new gallons so we know how many gallons are left, i.e., we know how many gallon of fuel the plane has. Adding the final gallons will tell us that the plane has 187 gallons of fuel for the trip.\n6.

Ten yards behind you and 15 yards to your left there is a mailbox. There is a tree 15 yards to the right and behind you. How far is the fence from you?\n\nOutput:There are a bunch of ways to solve this problem, but one way you can think about it is by drawing a grid on a piece of paper, with the size of the grid based on the distances, which are 100, 10, 15, and 15. In this case, the grid should be 100 units by 4 units. If we label the corners of the grid to show the locations of the objects, we find that they are the following:\n\n- Fence: (100, 0)\n- Behind: (90, 10)\n- right: (115, 0)\n\nNext, we have to find the distance from the fence to behind. To do so, we first find the distance from the behind to the fence, because that is where the fence is. This distance is simply (90 - 10) = 80 units. Since we already know the length of the fence, we can find the distance from behind to the fence: 80/100 = 0.8. Therefore, the distance from behind to fence is 0.8 units.\n\nNow we add to the distance we know is behind the fence the distance from the fencing to the tree. Since we know this distance to be 15 units, all we have to do is add them together to find the distance from behind the fence to the tree, which is 0.8 + 15 =", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "13171 -13171 is the final answer we have to get if we need to calculate the total time to fill 24 packets with 50 gummy bear inside.\n\nInput: What will the temperature be if all the people in the room shiver 5 times for a minute each?\nOutput: The room was originally at a temperature of 70 degrees. This means that by shivering, the temperature of the room decreases by 5 degrees. Since there are 12 people who shiver, this means that the room temperature will decrease by 60 degrees (12 x 5).  Therefore, the room temperature will decrease from 70 degrees to 10 degrees (because the room was originally at 70 degrees and the temperature decreased by 50 degrees). Finally, since the temperature decreases by 10 degrees while all the people are in the room shivering, it means that the room will have a temperature of 50 degrees by the time the people stop shivering (because the room will be 10 degrees cooler than it was at the start).", "answer": " 40"}

The walls of a room will likely be approximately the same width and height, such that the area of each room can be approximated using the formula for the area of a rectangle or square. By using this formula, and the given values, it is possible to calculate the total surface area of all three rooms, and then multiply it by the area covered by each gallon of paint to find the number of gallons needed.\n2. Area of each room: The total area of each room can then be found by multiplying the width x height of each room, by 400 or 600 (respectively, depending on the room) to obtain the area of each room. For room 1, the width is 600, and the height is 400, so the area is 240,000 sq. ft.\n3. Area of all three rooms: The total area of all three rooms can then be found by adding the three areas together.

You will find the circumference of the circle by dividing the diameter by 2.  Since r is the radius, you can use the value of 15 ( \u03c0 r3 ) for the diameter of the circle if you divide it by 2. This is how you calculate the radius: In this case, you must multiply \u03c0 by the radius of a sphere. After multiplying these two numbers, you will have \u03c0(r2). Next, you should multiply the radius and \u03c0(r2). In order to find this, multiply the radius by \u03c0(r).\n\nInput:The circumference of a circle is 244\u03c0.

The amount of practice Johnny has is equivalent to the amount of days ago he had half of it.  Also, the amount of practice he has will be doubled if he adds the amount of practice he had two days ago. Thus, the amount of practice Johnny has currently is the same thing as the number of days that have passed since he had half of the practice he currently does.\n3. If Johnny had half of practice after 20 days ago, and if he currently practices 20 times a day, the amount of times he practices will be tripling.  That means after he has had half the original amount of days that he had for the first 20 days, he will have reached 3 times as many days as he needed to get 200 practice.\n4.

Here, let's divide the cube by 2, then we get the half cube. So, if the side of the cube is 2, then the half cube will have the side 1. Let's draw the half cube, like this.\n\nThen, we can find the 2 diagonals in the half cube, and the sum of the 2 diagonels must be equal to number of the whole sides, not the half sides. Therefore, we can find the diagonal sum by the formula :\n\n2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "As mentioned, the question is asking about how far Kyle threw the ball compared to Parker.  To this end, we need to determine Parker's distance.  To obtain Parker's distance, we must first determine Grant's distance.  Let x = Parker's distance and y = Grant's distance.  25% of 16 is 4.0.  The distance that Grant threw the ball is therefore 1+4/2 is 6.66.  Thus, Parker's distance is 16 - 6.66 = 9.34 meters.  This tells us that 2 times Kyle's distance is 2*(2*.67).  The formula for the area between two curves is simply 1/2 area of the rectangle underneath the curves.  In this case, we are comparing the area of the rectangle from 9.34=x to 16 = y (x > 9.34, therefore the rectangle on the positive y-axis from 9.3y to 16).  Note that 4/2 is the area of the rectangle, we now have to determine the height of the rectangle; the difference between Parker and Kyle's height: 16-9.34 = 6.66 Now we have this expression: Area(9.54, 16) + area(9.3,16) = 4/2(6.66) + 4/2(1) And it is from this expression that we get Kyle's height, when we plug in the numbers for the variables here: (4/2)(6.66) = (4/2)(16 - 9.34)  Kyle's height is therefore 16-15.76=1.24 \nSo the final answer Kyle's height was 1.24\n*Note: I had a little trouble on why 9.99 = Kyle. In the previous answer, Parker threw the ball as x=9.34 (since Parker was chosen). Since 2*Grant = Kyle + x (Kyle + Parker), 2*Grant should be equal to 17 (it is) 2*Grant /2 = Kyle/2 + 9.34/2", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "The answer can be found by working back from the final number of 847. We know that each decade the monster killed decreased that number. If on the first 100 years of the monster attacks, there were 12 ships attacked, therefore, there must have been 480 or 12 * 40. Now we can go ahead and look at the next 100 years. We need to determine how many ships were attacked in each of the next 10 years. If we take the number attacked in the previous year, add 2 to it, and subtract one we can figure out the average number of ships attacked. We now see that in the 101st year there were two fewer people eaten than the previous year. If on the 201st year, only 5 people are eaten, we now know two things. First the monster only eats a small percentage of the people on each ship. Second, every hundred years the population of the planet doubles. So, if the monster killed 12 people 100 years ago, it will kill at least 24 people now. Also, if in every 100 years, the monster kills 48 more people than in the last 100 years we can conclude it will kill 96 people in the next 101 years. So it is safe to conclude at some point we will start getting ahead. Therefore, in the 125th year the monster will kill 118 people. Now we simply take our 100-year figure 117 and add 21 times, and the new figure is 49. That makes our total of 847 490.

Since seawater contains 20% salt that means that salt is 20/100 = 0.2 g/100ml of seawater. If we add the weight of the bucket then we can calculate weight of water.\nSince there is 2 litres of water then water weighs 2g\nSince container weight is 3 kg then container weighs 3000/1000 g, we can add water weight with container and it will be 5000g\nWeight of the container with salt = 2g + 0.2g\nSo, container with weight 2.2g\nThen to calculate how much weight of salt is 0.2 g then it will be 17 g\nTherefore if all water evaporates then 17g will be left\nThen 17g of salt = 1700mL salt that means 17 ml of salt in 1 L of water\nTherefore mL of salt is 4900 so, 4900/10=490 ml of salt \nSo, when salt evaporates the remaining liquid will contain 490ml of salt.", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "1. The question is simple enough: Herman wants to feed three different amounts of bird food over the course of three different months. In other words, he wants to feed them:\n\n- 1/2 cup of bird food per day in December\n- 1/4 cup per day in January and February\nIt's a great idea to do this, but let's get to working on how to do the math!\n\n2. So, Herman wants to feed 1/2 cup to each individual bird in December. 1/2 cup per day, x 31 days in December, equals 15 individual cups of food per day.\n3. Similarly, Herman wants to give 1/4 cup to each bird in January and February. 1/4 cup x 30 days equals 15, meaning we also have a total of 15 individual birds in months like January and February.\n4. Last, Herman wants to buy enough food for each bird all at once, just to make things easier. Thus, the final answer of how much bird food Herman must purchase is given by these two subtractions:\n5. 15 + 15 + 30 - 15 +15 = 70\n6.

Two roasters each with two handles are used to lift the weight. One roaster handle is six inches away from the fulcrum, and another roaster is 12 inches away from the fulcmum. What distance apart would the roasters be from the fulcrum if, by moving the roasters, an extra one-foot lift is obtained?\n\n### Solution:\n\nAnswer: This is quite a good problem with quite a few variables involved.\n\nFirstly, we will do some calculations on the 9-pound's weight which is 9 pounds. We will divide the weight of the 9-pounds by 9lbs and then we get a fraction which is 1/9. We can also know that we have a 6-foot length in the string and we need to know the displacement distance of the roaster from the start of the string. So we can have the displacement distance as \\$\\mathrm{9} lbs x 6 ft\\$ which is \\$\\mathrm{54 ft}\\$ this is already converted since we use 'ft' as our units.\n\nWe now have a displacement distance from a fulcrum and we need to add a distance of 1-ft to the previous displacement distance but we need to be aware of where the fulcrum is. For that, we will divide our displacement distance by two because there are roasters on each handle and a fulcrum in each roasters handle respectively. We divide 54 by 2 because this is the first roaster which is 6 inches away from the fulcrumb and we can use 56 ft as a final displacement.\n\nNow, we will add 1-ft because this is the distance we want from the start displacement distance.

The second formula is more straightforward - just subtracting how long he rested from how long he played gives us our answer. We get 50 minutes on the field and 20 minutes off the field, which adds to a total of 35 minutes.\n4. The first formula tells us we need to subtract 20 (the first number he played for) and 20 (the second number he played for) from 90 (the given time). We end up with 40 minutes in resting plus 50 minutes playing, a total of 90 minutes for Mark on the soccer field.\n5.

{"text": "16 cupcakes, 15 packets of cookies and 35 packets of biscuits = 70 + 40 + 15 = 125 units = $187.50  If she decides to raise the prices of cupcakes by 10% and cookies by 12% and continues to produce at the same rate, how much will her earnings be for five days? \nOutput: If the price of cupcakes increases by 10%, it means that each cupcake would now cost $1.65, which is $0.15 more than its original price of $1.50. Based on the original total, there were 16 cupcakers sold per day. Each one of them cost a price of $0.15 per unit, which is an equivalent of $2.80.\nSimilarly, the price of cookies will increase by 12%, which means that each one costs $2.24, which is $0\\.20 more than its original price. If the price is $2.24 per unit, each packet of cookies costs $1.12, which is 1.12 x 10, which is slightly greater than $2.\n\nHowever, if the total amount of biscuits is considered, the new value of each biscuit will be $2.08, which is slightly less than $2. And if the price of a cupcake is $1.65 and a biscuit will be 2.08, the value of a cookie will be around $2 based on the original price. The total amount of earnings for a day, therefore, will be the total amount for each day in the original.\nBut if the total is multiplied by the cost increase percentage, which is $1.57, then the total amount of earnings will be\nAnswer:\nIf we increase the price of cupcakers by 10% we multiply $1.57 by 0.1, and the earn of $1.57 multiply by 10, resulting $1.18, is 16 cupcaker x 10 x $1.18= $187.6 for 05 x 5 days and the profit\nAnswer:", "answer": " 350"}

Cash is used for everyday transactions, including for buying food, clothes, and other necessities. Other things that are often bought with cash include electronics, gifts, and other items that are expensive or difficult to return.\n4. The best answer would be a gift, because a gift card is a card that you can use to buy things at a specific store. It is accepted in more places than cash and can be used for more than just one thing, like a gift card to a grocery store. This answer is not correct though, because gift cards are not accepted everywhere and are", "answer": " 6"}

Eric fished out a quarter, so (2/3) + 90 - 1/3 = 81, or $0.81 in dollars and $0.18 in cents in 81 cents.\nThen Ivy fished out 60 pennys, adding up to a total of 121 cents, so (6/7) + (121/7) + 90-6 = 3/7 quarters.\n\nSubtracting $0.18 from $0.81, Garrick caught 60 pennes, giving him a total of $0.79 plus $60, so $0.79 + 60 - $0.18 - Garrick's 3/7 of a quarter = $1075/98 equals 1075/7 dimes in 492 pennies, so 10750 dimes in 4,920 pennies, totalling $0.25.\n\nThus, the total amount of money, the final answer, is 1075 dimes, or $10.75 in dollars in 4,962 pennies, which amount 11037 pennies in total.\n\n\n\n### The final answer is 11039 dimes in total.", "answer": " 200"}

If the average grade of the n students whose test grade is between 60 and 70 inclusive is m%, what is the average test grade in the whole class?\nOutput:C. 77.6.\nLet's take the original question, suppose the sum of total mark =175. Let's assume n is the number of students and m is the number of students who had a grade of 9's and above. Let's assume x is the average grade of n students whose test grades are between 60 and\n70. So, the test score that is not included in the students' test scores is x+m. So the original question can be formulated as below:\n\n$$\\Large \\frac{(n - m) (x+m)}{n + m} =\\Large{\\frac{74 x}{n + m}}$$\n\n$$\\Larage\\Large{(n - m)(x+m)-nx}=\\Large{n(74-x)}\\Larage$$\n\nThe sum of both sides will equal to 0.

And two rooms, one just below deck. Fred and Linda can only fit into the lower room. Clyde cannot fit into either room. How do you make room for Clyde?\nOutput: There is a simple and logical solution for this question. The first thing you need to do is to put both Fred and Linda and put them to the deck. In the room below, Clyde will be in that room.\nFinally, there is one bedroom and one deck. So you do the same thing on the other room. It is very simple. If you need to add someone on the boat, but you don't want a room to be empty, go to the room, and do it.\n\nYou're on a boat, which can be represented by a 4 x 4 matrix. The room below is the first row, with the second and third being the lower and upper rooms, respectively. \n\nSo, from the second room below, the room should have Fred and Linda, Clyde should be under deck, and you need to put them in both rooms below. The answer is to go back up to deck, and put them both in that room, and let Clyde be on the lower room. Now you have 2 seats that are empty, you can go back to the room again. After repeating the process, you need 2 chairs in a room that have both person in the room. After that, you should go back to the second row, and put everyone into that room, and the whole process is finished.\n\nIf you want everyone to be at some place, try to go back and put them all on deck. They're all going to be in a room that fits everyone. So, the process will be the same, the idea is to get them both in one room.\nIf you do not need to put in the whole way so you can place someone, for example, I need to put someone in a room. I only need to go back to the room and put them there. After they are successfully", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "1) The ball thrown by Belinda moved at a speed of 0.5 m/s. (It moved 20 feet in 8 seconds)\n\n2) The ball moving at 0.5 m / s  takes 0.3 seconds to travel 1 feet. This is because 1 feet = 0.3 seconds. Since the length of the ball is 8 inches, it takes 8 times as long, equal to 8 x 0.3 seconds, or 2.4 seconds to travel 8 inches, when moving at 0.3 seconds / inch.\n\n3)  The border collie runs at a speed of 5 feet / second, so 1 foot = 0.2 seconds, and 8 inches = 20 feet. It will take 0.4 seconds (20 feet / 5 feet = 0.4 seconds) to travel 2.4 times as long (8 inches / 0.4 seconds), equal to 2 inches. In total, it takes 2.4 + 0.4 = 2.8 seconds to catch up to the point where the ball is now.\n\n4) The ball will be thrown 3.2 feet away from where Belinda starts, since it travels at a speed of 32 inches per second.\n\n5) Adding 2.8 seconds, equal to the time it takes for the border collie to run that distance, the border collie can catch up to the ball.\n\nInput: The answer to the equation is 6.89.\n\n\nInput: What is the most common type of snake in the world?

Bree will earn $2000 a month but she only needs the first to last month total to be $2, and each month (including this) will cost her $1925/12 = 15.54 (or $16).

It was 1/12 of 1 quart of Diana's milk that was added, therefore Amandine needs to provide 12 quarts of milk to make the same amount of cream soup this year.\nSo the final result is A: 12 quarts", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": "answer: 28 birds\n\nInput: Let A, B, C be subsets of a set S. We say that the union of the sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to either of the sets A or B. We define the cardinality of the union of the sets by noting that A union B has exactly the elements that belong to both sets A or B.\nThe intersection of 2 sets is the set containing only the elements belonging to both sets. (Ex: {1, 2} intersection {3, 6, 10} = {3, 6}). The complement of a set S is the remaining set of elements that are either not in S, or that S and the complement set are disjoint, i.e., they are the same elements of nothing. The intersection of any two nonempty subsets of 2A is nonempty. Therefore, the number of elements in 2S is the cardinality of the set S, i.e., |S| = |A union B| for all the subsets A and B that are nonempty.\nHowever, if we had 2A union {1} and A intersection {1}, then the cardinality of the intersection is the cardinality of both of the nonempty sets.\n\n(1) Cardinality of the union of sets a and {1} is non zero.\n\n(2) If b is the cardinality of a and {1}, then b +1 = cardinality of a union {1}.\n(3) Using the previous equation, we find that |b + 1| = |a union {1}|.\n(4) Cardinality of a union {A1} is the cardinality of A1 union A. We have shown that cardinality of a and cardinality of a union A1 is not equal, therefore, the cardinality of A is not 0.\n\nAnswer: Input:There are six pairs of socks in a drawer.

The question is asking how long it takes to boil 4 L of water, which is equivalent to asking how long it takes 4 L of water to boil. 2). To answer the question, one must first calculate the volume of water remaining when it is boiled completely. Since boiling is reversible process, we can use the rule, \"Boiling a liquid decreases its volume.\" 3). If we assume that the initial volume of 4 L water occupies the entire container without disturbing other layers of water, then the total volume 4 L initially  -  volume 3 L boiled  = volume  of  water  remaining  (4  - 3 = 1) 4 L.  4). To determine how long it takes to completely boil the remaining volume(1 L), one must divide the volume by the rate in which the water is boiled(1 L / 1 min) or take the reciprocal of the rate(1/1 min) and multiply it by the volume of water left remaining(1/1 L = 1/min). So the time it takes to completely boiled a volume of 1 L of water is 1 min. 5 ). Since the initial volume of water was 4 L, we can boil down 2 L of water in 2 min. 6). To answer the question completely, we sum the volumes that take up the initial 4 L, which takes 12 min to boil the initial 4 L completely. 7). To boil the remaining 2 L of water, we divide the 2 L of water and the rate (1 min) to know time it takes to boil down these remains. Since 1 L of water takes 1 min,  2 L of water takes 2 min. 8). Thus the final answer is the sum of 1", "answer": " 2"}

Additionally, we need to find Cadence's salary ($5000 per year in the old company and 20% more for the new company) and the number of years she's worked for each company (3 in the old company and some yet unspecified number of years in the new company).\n\nThe time Cadence has worked in her new company is equal to the time in (3 years of employment with $5000/month + the additional time in the new company), which can be solved via calculus to find.

{"text": "Two men and three women buy X apples together. The two men each buy 30 apples and the three women buy X-70 apples. Therefore, the answer to this question depends on the number of apples available for purchase, which is represented by X. If X is not specified, there are several ways that the two men and three women could buy apples.\n1. If X is 10 and there are exactly 30 apples remaining, each man would purchase 30 apples while each woman would purchase 10.\n2. If X is 20 and there are exactly half of the apples still available, or 15, each woman would purchase 7 of the remaining apples and the men would buy 30-15 apiece. This solution is different from the solution in case 1 primarily because the men may have purchased some fewer apples.\n\n3. If X is 40 and there are no remaining apples (X=30), three men and one woman would have purchased the full 40 apples. But if there were 50 apples remaining, three men and two women would have purchased all of the apples.\n\n4. If X is 60 and there are 50 apples left, three men and two woman will buy the 60 apples.\nTherefore, the answer to this problem depends on the number of available apples and one needs to be careful to specify which case is being analyzed.\n\nInput:What is the value of a?\n\nOutput: In this example, the answer depends not on the question, but rather on how it is phrased.

The pool holds 6000 liters and she fills it at 1.6 liters a minute, while simultaneously a leak is draining out 100 liters a minute.  Therefore, 6000 minutes is 100 litres less than what Lydia is putting in a minute, so each minute it's getting 6000-(100*60) and this is what she is putting in, so they are equal, and to fill it she has to fill up each time by 60 liters.  So to fill it up it takes minutes, the number of liters to put in, times this, and there we go 100 litters a minute.\n##Output:This can be determined.\tThe pool holds 60 liters and she \tfills it at 1.5 liters a minute, \twhile simultaneously a leak is drai\tning out 90 liters a minute, so the\ttotal loss is 90 liters per minute. \tSo each minute it's 60 liters minus 90 liters. \tThis is what Lydia is pouring\tin, so for the first minute, put 60\tin, minus a little over 90, and for\tthe next minute it is 60 less 90. \tAnd the rate at which Lydia is \tpouring in water is equal to the \trate at which her pool is drain\ting.

Choices: A: 20,21,22 B: 24,25,26 C: 27,28,29 D: 23,24,25 E: 34,35,36\nOutput:\nI. The first number of the series needs to be 20\nII. The second number of the series needs\nto be 21\nIII. The third number of the series needs t\no be 22\nIV. Because there will be a 2 and another 0 at the end\nV. The final number of the series is 27 and it will be 30\nSo the final answer will be ABC : 20,27,3", "answer": " 216"}

Your friend starts with a better position. You win the game.\nOutput:  \"Fool\" is a derogatory term that has been used historically to mean \"silly person\", and can also mean more aggressively, someone who is attempting to deceive others or is malicious. In the first statement it is used in the sense of \"deceive\", but in the second statement \"fool\" is being used for the latter definition of meaning. When the friend says \"you will never win against a fool\", it means that because you can deceive and trick your friend that you will never be in an inferior position to him, and thus will always be able to win.\n\nIn this scenario, the friend is claiming that you cannot defeat someone if you are in an inferior position, which in this scenario your friend is in. Therefore, you cannot be \"a fool\" in the sense that your friend used the word; you cannot defeat someone who is in a superior position than you. You can lose games against a superior position. The second statement does not mean you will win all the time against a person because you cheat.\n\nA person who is fooling around is using some form of deception, trickery, or dishonesty in order to \"fool around\".

{"text": "If Maude will be a certain age now, Emile will be a multiple of that age in the future (2x). Similarly, Anne will be 2x 2x the age that Emile is in the future. The final problem is to calculate Maude's age in the future, which is solved by the expression: Maude's age x 6 x (Maude's age / 8) = age of Emile x 2 x age of Maude. Solving for either Maude's age now (x4) or the age of Anne in the future (x2x x4) yields the answer of 16 years.\n\nInput: There are 445 students in a college, 420 of which are females. There are 195 students in the college who are males, and 255 of them are not female. How many of the remaining 445 students are female?\nOutput: The answer is 240, because there are 255 non-females (255 > 420), so 255 - 420 = 125 males, and 125/2 = 63 males are not female, and 63 + 420 =246 females, 246 - 420 (the total number of females) = 194 females out of 445, which is 194/445, or 43% of the population.\n\nInput: A group of 8 volunteers for a poll is randomly picked to answer the question: \"How many of you are satisfied with your job?\" The group will answer with one of the following options: \"Sure!\", \"Not so much\", or \"No way!\".

Assume the first train travels for 23 x 5 = 115 minutes. Then 200 people = 200 / 115 = 1.75 people per square mile, and 1000 > 1.75 * 200 = 350,  so we know the second train cannot catch up for exactly 115 minutes due to overcrowding.

Now the next thing is the 35% of the students read two novels which we know that 66/180th grade studenet read two novels. Next we have the 5/12th of the students which is equal to 10 so they read one novel. So now we are looking for the students who do not read anything. So first we are going to subtract 126 which is the sum of the nine-tenths from the initial 240 so that give us 16 that represents all the students who do not  read anything.

{"text": "1. The question asks how many words Carl can type in seven days if he types at a speed of fifty words per minute.\n2. Answer choice 1:11250. The numerator, 4 hours, is the amount of time Carl can type each day, so 4\u00d750=2000 words per day. Then, the total words for 1 day\u00d77 days= 11250 words in 7 days.\n3. Answer 2:14000. The numerator is 4\u00d750 again, for an amount of 2000 words written per day. To find the denominator, multiply the denominator by seven, since there are 7 days total. Therefore, 7\u00d74, and to simplify the fraction, there are 28 words written each day. Then, the equation 2000\u00d728=14000 words per 7 days.\n4.

{"text": "It is possible to answer this question in two ways. The primary one is to consider the problem at a higher level: the total weight required by all three people is 35 pounds of wood. This means that each person has to collect approximately 12 pounds of wood. However, by definition, Kimberley already collects 12 lbs since this is the amount that Houston collects. Therefore, we can conclude that Ela has to collect 11 pounds of wood to make up for the difference between Houston's contribution and the 35 total pounds needed for everyone in their Grammy's care. This method uses problem solving strategies and mathematical logic, rather than specific math techniques.\n\nAn alternative is to use basic multiplication and division.\n\nTo multiply 12 by 2, we can use the shortcut:\n\n12 x 2\n= 12 x (1/2)\n= 12/2 = 6\n\nAs the shortcut of 12 x 2 = 12/2 was not covered in previous math lessons, another method to multiple may also be used:\nFor 12 x 1/2, convert 1/2 to 1 divided by 2 =.5\n\n12 x.5 = 6\n\nNote: in some countries 12 divided by 2 = 6 may be taught in math lessons. This was not covered in our primary school.\n\nNow that we have the answer (6), we need to divide the given total of wood (35) by the amount that Kimberley already owns (6):\n35/6 = 6\n\nConclusion: Ela must make a contribution of 11 pounds of firewood to their Grammy!\n\nInput: A: A student who is trying to achieve his dream.

{"text": "1. This is a fairly common question on the LSAT that involves percent of total number of items, and a remainder after the percent. This can be re-written as: the remainder number we are looking for after 80% of the total number of books is 80% x Total number of books. So, you will have to compute (1 -.80), and you will get 20%. So all the answer choices that involve % of total number of one item after certain total percent of that item has been removed are incorrect. You will have to simply perform the mathematical manipulations on the total number of items in the library and keep it simple.\n\n2. 80% x 2300 = 1840. 20% x 210 = 420. 1840 - 420 = 1420. Here, 80% of 2300 books is 1840 books, so answer choice C which subtracts 1840 from 2300 is incorrect. Answer Choice B, which subtracts 1420 from 2350, is incorrect. Answer choice A, which subtracts 3600 from 5700, is incorrect since the total number of English books is greater than the total number of books in the library, so the difference between the two could not be more than the total number of English-language books.\n\n3. To further narrow down the answer choices to the correct answer, you need to recheck the total number of different books in the library- 2300.

{"text": "A cheetah and a gazelle start out at the same distance (210 ft) from each other and are moving at the same speed in the same direction towards the starting point. Given this information and the speed of the animals, we can determine how many seconds it would take the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle.\n\nThe key to solving this question is to look at the relationships between distances, speed, and acceleration in the given information.\n\nFirst, we know that the initial distance between the cheetah and the gazelle is 210 feet, and the initial speed of each animal is 60mph. This means that if the two animals travel at the same speed, they will cover a distance of 30 ft in 1 minute, or 1800 feet in 60 minutes (1 hr).\n\nNext, we know that the gazelle has a higher top speed than the cheetah, and can therefore move faster than the cheetah can over the same period of time. This means that if they start out at the same speed and distance, the cheetah will be able to accelerate more quickly than the gazelle and overtake it.\n\nFinally, we know that in order for the cheetah to overtake the gazelle, the gazelle must decelerate to a speed lower than the cheetah's top speed. This means that the gazelle must be able to travel at least 60mph so that it can stop and then start up again to avoid being overtaken by the cheetah.\n\nUsing these pieces of information, we can create a simple equation to determine how many seconds it will take for the cheetah and gazelle to reach their original speeds once again when they start and end at the same point. This equation is represented by the following:\nFx(t) = mx(t) + at^2 +b\n\nHere, Fx(t) is the final distance traveled by the cheetah at time t, mx(t) is its initial distance, at^2 is the acceleration,and b is constant. Solving the above equation for time, we can get the following result:\n\n$$ \\begin{aligned} t &= \\frac{ \\sqrt{2(\\Delta x)^2 +(\\Delta v)^2 + b^2 + 2at}}{m(", "answer": " 7"}

How many girls at the school like baseball? Answer:305 girls and 63 boys who like basketball. How were the results of the survey surprising? Answer: It is surprising that 20% of girls in the school like basketball and 10% of boys in the school like baseball.\nOutput: ANSWSER: The results of the survey were a little surprising, but only slightly. It is surprising that 553 girls and 165 boys like basketball, but surprising only in the sense that you might expect fewer girls (who represent 51.7% of students) to play a sport like basketball. Similarly, it's surprising that 269 students think baseball is fun to watch, and that number is slightly lower than the expected 322 by a factor of 38%, yet is still not too surprising to most people. The answer I got is as follows: Given the ratio of boys to girls that like basketball, that would be the boys/girls ratio of 135:400. Given the ratio of girls to boys that like baseball, that would be the girls/boys ratio of 80:300.

Choices: 1. 5cm 2. 6cm 3. 7cm\nOutput: 3.The first figure is a right triangle (because the shaded quarter is 4/16 of a circle, which is 1/4 of a full circle), so the area of the figure is 1/2 * 4 * \u03c0 * r * r = 4 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 16 \u03c0 r2.\nLet the shaded circle's radius be r. So, 16\u03c0r2 = 22, or 22 = 16\u03c0r. The radius is 4\u03c0/16, or 2\u03c0/(4 * 3) or roughly pi/6.

{"text": "Here we are given the following information: Isabel is given some money in her pinky bank that she later decides to spend on a toy. She takes half of her money and spends it on the toy. Then, she takes the other half and decides to spend that money on her brother. What she is then left with is $51.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to have a bit of knowledge about adding numbers written in the form where both numbers have three digits. This way of writing numbers is known as standard form.\n\nOne way of adding these numbers without carrying is to move to standard form when you are ready to add up the digits. Thus, $50 + 1 = 102 in standard form.\n\nHowever, you should realize that once the three digit numbers are written in standard form, they don't look like regular standard form numbers. They also have the digits 5, 1, and 0 that don't exist in regular numbers. To add two of those numbers, we carry 1, where you add two and carry the 1. The resulting number is 2 +1 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nTo find out how much money Isabel had in her pinky box, you should perform the following:\n\n(i) Convert the number 51 into standard form: 51 = 100+5,1\n(ii) Subtract the number 100 from number 101, then carry 1 as the unit digit\n\nTo find out the number of dollars, Isabel had, simply add 4 to the two numbers where each number ends with the digits 4 and 1. Thus, the answer is 100\n\nThank you for trying this problem, let's move on to the next one.\n\nInstruction:Answer the following grammar question.\n\nOutput: 3.

What percent of an average household's expenses go toward rent?\n\n### Exploration:\nRationales:\n1. The question asked is about finding the percentage of an average household'spending to go towards rent.\n2. The first thing that should come to your mind is that, most people pay rent and rarely spend anything on clothing.\n3. Hence, a very sensible option would be to multiply the total amount spent with clothing with the percentage of an average households spends on clothing.\n\n4.  For such an expression, let the total be X.\n5. Now,\n\n6. $100,000= (X * 0.08%) + (X * 00.07%) + (X *0.03%) $\n7.

The first level of abstraction is the literal one given by the question, where we have to answer the question by counting the exact number of years from the original start point given by the question. \n\n2. Another level of abstraction is based on the given information in the question. To find the age of a person, we can use the formula: person's age = birth year + life years.\n\n3. In this response, I will explain this second level of abstraction and how it can be applied to this task.\n\n4. According to this formula, the age of the fourth child is equal to:\n5. The next line of the question states that the fourth child was born two years after the birth of the third child.\n6. Now, according to the formula, the age of an individual will increase by 1 every year he/she lives.\n7. So, the fourth child was born after 2 years, which makes it 18 years old. Note that the question mentions 5 years more as given by the answer 15 years ago, which is a small mistake in the sentence as there are 10 years, in which the 5th year happens to be the 15th year before today.

If the fox runs for 1 minute, then it would move a distance of 0.5 kilo meters\n2.

If she bought 15 hearts, then there 34 - 15 = 19 left. If she bought exactly 25 eyes, then there 16. The number of hearts + eyes must equal the number of lungs since organs in the body are matched pairs.

Next, we move on to identify the choices for where, or what this plumbing is given to us.\n   5. The first option of A: oil refinerie is incorrect because oil refineries do have a plumbing but, it takes water and not oil to quench your \n        thirst. Similarly, the choice of wall is omitted because walls do not have a plumbing.\n        And also B: show is excluded as shows do not have a plumming system.\n        The final two options C: your own home and D: a water fountain are correct since both these choices contain a plumbing. \n        Now we are left with two choices, plumbing and the purpose of the plumbing are known to us.\n   6. E: water fountains, will not quench our thirst since it is not a liquid that can quench thirst and thus it is not a viable answer.\n   7. Hence, the only choice option E: water fountian is irrelevant.\n        Now we are down to finding the place that has a plumbing with liquid.\n   8.

{"text": "Answer: There would be a total of 430.25 cents for 7 pages. We can find this value using the summation formula because each page costs $.10, and Jenny wants to print seven copies of the page. Therefore, the total cost to print seven copies would be $.10 * 7.\n\nAlso, we can get the value of 7 by adding the value of the pen and dividing it by the summation factor to get 7 pages.\n\nHence, the answer would be $.10*7+$.10*7+1.50*7, and this would provide the answer as 430.\n\n### Explain how to evaluate your answer:\nWhen we evaluate an answer, we check if it meets the requirements of the task by analyzing the number of choices used and if they made sense. There are instances where we use more than one choice, such as when we try to reach an understanding of a problem by analyzing it in several ways, and that is considered evaluation. However, here, there is a possibility of using more than one choice. There could have been more than one answer, given the task asked only for a single choice, or there could have been a possibility of using the pen or the twenty dollar bills to make more than one choice. This would have led to a mistake during interpretation of the answer, i.e., either interpreting them as two or only one, and that would have altered the answer.\n\n### Response time:\nIn response to the first question, the minimum time required is 20 seconds. The response is a mathematical problem that can usually be solved in a minimum time. In response to the second question, the answer required would involve some thought. The process involved could be about three or four minutes but could be extended depending on the amount of information required to understand the question and the nature of task response required.\n\n### Reliability:\n\n* First question: The calculation in this question requires a little of thought and logic to find an answer, and the answer depends on whether or not the correct information was written down. Reliability here depends on how well and accurately the task was interpreted and then the math involved in the calculation.\n* Second question: As with the first question, the answer to this question can be done, provided one has enough information to understand where the plumbing could", "answer": " 12"}

There are three farmers. Bob, Brenda and Bernie.\n3. The total area for all three farmers is 22 acres of corn, 38 acres of cotton, 24 acres of beans and 20 total acres.\n4. There were also given what the acreages each farm grows. Each acre produces 20,80, and 32 gallons of water per acre.\n5. We have to calculate what percentage of water used that will go to the farm of Bob, which produces 3 acres of corn and 9 acres of Cotton.\n6. Plugging in the numbers, 20 acres of corn will require 20 gallons per acre = 20*3 =60 gallons of water, and 42 acres of corn will require  90 gallons per ache = 90*9=810 gallons of water.\n7. We plug in corn acreages and get 60 + 810 = 870 gallons of water for corn.\n8. Like we have to do for Cotton and Beans.\n9. Totaling the amount of water that would be used for corn for all three farmers: 60+20*9 = 810+24*2 = 1074 gallons.\n10. Now to calculate Bernies usage, we have  20 * 2 = 40 and total his is 42 gallons of water. \n11.  And for Brenda we have  80+14*2 =216 +24*2 =516 gallons of water.

We already know that there are 60 cards in total, and 7 is the number of cards per pack.\n\n3. 46 is the total number of cards in 60 pack, and each pack contains 7 cards.\n\n4. So that 46 is divided by  7 is equal to 6, which means the number of packs can accommodate 6 packs of cards having 7 cards per pack.\n5. Because the packs of cards can carry 7 cards per pack, then the total number of cards is 6\u00d77.\n6. And  6\u00d77=42.\n\n7.

{"text": "The farmer sells each bale of hay for $1 and he sells them all in the same month that he harvests them, so the farmer makes $1 per bale.\n\n### Rationale:We don't need to calculate the actual number of bales he will be left with, because we must do this, we can look at the income and losses.\n\n### Income: The farmer will harvest 560 bale of hay, times 11 months, so he will have 6,560 bales total. The 7 acres he planted last year will produce 560 balle of hay per month. This year he will plant an extra 7 acres of grass, producing an extra 7 * 560 = 3,920 bales of hay per month.\n\n### Losses:He keeps 2 acres of grass for his own personal use, and 3 acres for his horses each month, so each month he consumes 2, 9 and 11, leaving him with 5 * 560 bals of hay, or 2,800 bales for January through May. Each month for the first year, he consumes more grass than he harvest, and therefore he is making a significant loss of $600 per month.\n\nIn the second year, he is once again making a loss, but not as much, by $540 per month, because even with the additional grass he adds, he is still using more grass than he harvests.\n\nFrom July onwards, he is actually making a gain. By June, he has used 8 acres of grass over the year, which will then have a harvest of another 8 acres. Since this is the one month he uses up all the grass he has planted, he will have a 100% surplus, of which he will sell $1000 each month to fund his own personal expenses. From then on, he will not be making a further gain, but he will not be losing money either, due to the increasing number of grass acres he has.\n\n### Answer:The farmer will go broke this year. The farmer started with 5,560 bale, and will harvest 8 acres of grass, which will produce 8 * 5", "answer": " 12834"}

In other words, he multiplied the distance of the half an hour by the rate of travel for the second half an hour. (During the original travel time, the rate was 0, so we multiply by 0, therefore it cancels out as there are no units, but when the rate of travel is negative the time remains as it is)\n\n\n### Input(:Answer the following.

They have just learned how rainbows form when the sunlight interacts with water droplets in the air. A tour guide is explaining that this light bending phenomenon happens because water droplets are much smaller than the wavelengths of the light, causing them to become lenses or prisms. Then, the rain starts to pour down.\nWhich of the following does NOT occur as a direct result of the rain?\n\n### Option selection:\n\n### Demostration:\n\n### Roles:\n  A tourist is a person traveling for leisure and enjoying what a place has to offer. They typically do not do much hard work at a new place, they explore to find fun experiences in different activities.\n   A tour guide is a person who tells other people about a certain place they are at for example. They often answer questions of tourists and their interest are often in the history or fun facts of the area you are learning of.\n   The tour guide is telling the Tourist about how rainbows form.\n   A rainbow forms because of water droplets.\n   Water droplets that make up a rainbow are much smaller than the light that causes the rainbow.\n   When the rain starts falling rain falls harder because of all the water droplets which are now much smaller than the light. They are absorbing more light.\n\n### Discussion\nIt makes it harder to see the rainbow because of all the light being absorbed and not light reflecting back. The rain makes it look darker making it harder to see the colors. It does not prevent the rainbow from forming however. The rain makes it so the light is scattered by the individual water particles, and so its color gets broken down and not as easily visible. As mentioned, the light that makes up a rainbow is spread out. Because it can not have a long distance between the light particles it becomes more visible because the light doesn't have much distance it can spread out.\n\n### Input \nWhich of the statements below is true of metallic bonds?\nA) Each metal in metallic bonds shares", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "$576/80/6 = $7 per hour\n\n### Explanation:\n1. Here, we are just figuring out the hourly pay rate.\n2. The employee is Edric.\n3. The monthly pay is $576 because he gets paid every month. A 'pay check' is a piece of paper on which it is written how much you have been paid.\n4. We are told that the employee is paid $576 a month.\n5. One month has 30 days/days in a week means 60 hurs a week. Thus, he is paid $57.6 every day or $576 every month.\n6. It should be noted here that the employee is paid at the end of each month, which is the last day or the day before the last. This is because we are payed at the end of each week and at the end of each pay check, when we get paid.\n7. The employee works every day which means he works 6 days a week.\n8. There are 8 hours in a day. Thus, he works for 6 days and that is 42 hours a week. A 'work week' is a 5-day period.\n9. Here we are finding his hourly pay rate. So we multiply 576 by 80 by 6. Here the first number is the total number of dollers he gets paid every month, the second number is the 5 days a week he works, and the third number is the 6 days a week he works.\n10. We have now found his hourly pay rate so he earns $7 an hour ($576/8hrs x 6 days).", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "Answer (3)\n\nInput:What is 9 divided by 3?\n\n### Your response:Answer (3)Rationales:1. We can see that the divisor is three (3) and the dividend is nine (9).\n2. According to rules of long division, we place a decimal between the dividend and the divisor.\n3. After we have a decimal, nine divided by three:\n\n```c\n 9\n3\n```\n\n4. The first number tells us that we put nine on that column and put a zero on the row above it.\n5. The second number tells us that we place the three on that column, and put one on the row above it.(3)\n6. So 9/3 equals 3.\n7. And the whole answer must be a whole number.\n8. Therefore 9 divided by 4 equals 3.(3)\n9. We can confirm using the remainder calculator. And the remainder is zero.\n10.

After that, he lets the water run for another 2 minutes and clos\n\\-es the water supply again. This is repeated for a total of 60 minutes.\n4. Here the amount of water that has been used is \\>= 120 litres, as the 1-minute test is failed and Robi needs to repeat the test.\n5. Given: The flow of water comes out to be 12 lit/min and the capacity of the tub is 120 lit/min.\n6. The cap at the bottom of a tub is not airtight and lets \\>= 1 lit/min to escape.\n7. Using the assumption, Robi can fill the 120-lit tub by \\>=120/cap=120 litres.\n8.

{"text": "Let's start by rewriting the question in a different way. We have the costs and the products individually, so let's multiply the cost by the number of products and get the total expense: $$50*1 = 50$$\n\nNow there are two parts left. You have an extra $5. The next part should involve the products you bought. Write down that as well. Let's say you bought 5 pens ($5) and 12 notebooks ($72). \n\nThe extra $5 will cover the two pens.\n\nNow the question involves the change. We must calculate how many times $50 ($50) is less than the total cost of the products ($108). We know that $$50*1 < 108, 6 times and since we can't divide by 1, we must then take away 6 times $50.\n\nDo you notice how you already have the products and the remaining amount after the change? Well, in order to be sure that the calculator is giving you the last amount left over, we have to add 108 to 0, because the remainder at the end must be 2 and it is 0.

{"text": "### Answer:\n\n* 390757269812315 students\n\n\n### Discussion:\n1. If we assume that the students have no choice when given a desk, then the correct answer is 57,812,315 students:  There are 15 classrooms with 30 desks per classroom, and 10 classrooms with 25 desks per classroom. A classroom can accommodate 30 students. There are 2,315,663 students in 57,891,237 classrooms (one desk for 2 classes) with 30 desk in each classroom (which equals 30/3). There are 65,891,938 students in 12,461,927 classrooms (one student for 1 class) with 25 desk in each class room (which equals 25/1).  2. If we consider the situation that a student might be given a choice of a specific classroom, then it is clear that we require more classrooms. For example, in 57,912,318 classrooms (one desks for 5 classes), we have 139,302,294 students (one student for 2 classes).In 30,891,077 classrooms (one classroom for 3 classes), we have 389,266,031 students (one classroom for one student).  3. If a student is given a choice of a classroom (with 30 students per classroom), this means that a desk is used in the least favourable manner, that is, one desk is sufficient for 2 classes (25 + 30). If a desk is used maximally, one desk is used for one class (30+0).

{"text": "There are 20 cows on the farm.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n1. The question is of a generalization about how much milk are collected from each cow over time.\n2. The question does not state or imply any constraints on the number of cows or the amount of milk each cow produces\n3. So our answers should not depend upon any of the above variables.\n4. The question further states that out of the five weeks, each week had an average production of 108 litres of milk.\n5. So, each cow per week, on average, produces 108 litters of milk.\n6. Then considering it is taken as five weeks, so each week gives an average production of 540 liters of milk per cow.\n7. Let's assume we have n cows on the farm, then by applying the given constraint for each of the five weeks, we can say that the number of cows producing 540 litters of milk per week = (n * 108) * 5, or in total each week n/(n+1) cows(for n odd) or n/2 cows(for n even) are producing 540liters of milk each.\n8. However, this does not satisfy the condition as the given condition states that 2160litures of milk are produced in total.\n9. So taking that 108liters of milk are still remaining to produce, adding the value of those remaining litres for each of the n cows.\n10. This would result in each cow producing 224 litres of milk per week.\n11. For a total of 22(5/4) litres of milk per cow/week = 22(9/4) litres = 44 litres of milk. i.e., Each week each cow will produce 44 litres.\n12. So, 44 litres + 2160 = 2204 litres, which is exactly 2160.\n13. Hence, out of n cows, 20 cows produce 22litres of milk per cow each week.\n   \nAnswer:There are 21 cows on the farm producing 21.9 litres of milk per", "answer": " 24"}

The question asks how many key limes would you need to substitute the juice for in Audrey's recipe.\n2. The recipe asks a person to replace 1 quarter cup with 'extra tart'.\n3. So now we need to find ways to replace 1 cup with extra tart.\n4. There are 16 cups in a gallon, and each key lime yield contains 16 tablespoon of juices, so one cup is equal to 16 tablespoos.\n5. So now we need 1\u20444 cup which is 1\u20444 \u00d7 16 = 4 tablespoons.\n6. Doubling 4 tablespoons is 8 tablespoons which is also 4\u00d72 tablespoons.\n7.

You can either use a car or train\n\nRationale:\n1. The question is asking how quickly you can travel at a speed of 90 miles per hour, so you can use a plane.\n2.  The plane is quicker than train and same as car if you are going to town of 20,000 to 200, what's the quickest you can get there if you going with a car or train?\n3. As the speed of the train, it's 50 miles per hour, so the fastest you can travel is 200 miles in just 4 hours\n4.

If Mary cannot fit 42 items into a locker then by definition she can't have more than twice as much more room as there is room at the start.\n2. Therefore we know that the sum of all the items at the start, must be evenly divisible by 43, otherwise she won't have enough in the locker at the beginning of the month to end with 42 items.\n3. So she can't fit 5, 6 or 7 items in the locker at once\n4. Therefore the choices \"None\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", and \"5\" cannot be the answer.\n5.

{"text": "Let the total cost of milk and cereal be $T$, and the cost per dozen in gallons and cost per box be $g$ and $b$, respectively.\n\nSo, $3T/(2g-1) = 5$, or, $T = 2.5g$.\n\nNow, $5bT/(b-1) = 3$, or, $5bT = 3.5b$\n\nDividing both sides by $T$, we have $3g / (2-1) = 1.5b$, or $b = 2g /3$, so $3g / 3 = 1.5g$.\nRewrite this last equation, $g = 1/2$. Hence, each gallon of milk is half the price that its equivalent amount would have been had it not been on sale.\n\nFor the cereal, $T = 1.25 gb$, and $gb = 2/3$. So, $15g - 6 = 10$. $T = 0.1g$.\n\nThe total cost and total savings are both 0.1, which simplifies to $0.9$. There are three gallons of milk, so $3.0$ gallons at the first price is $3.6$, and the milk sold at last price is $3.0$, so the savings are $0.6$, which simplifies to $1.5$. There are five boxes of cereal, so the first case is $0.1$ for each box.\n\nCombining all the above, $3.6(0.1)+1.5(0.1) = 1/6=0.15$.\n\n### Input:-1, -2, 1, 6, 3, 0, 2, -5, -10, 1, -1,\n\n### Response:-1, -2\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Input:/p2=list_name, x1, y1-y2, x2-x20, x21-x22, x3, y3-y4, y4-y8, z, z1, z2, z3\n\n### Demostration:", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "Input: \"Grandpa Lou enjoying watching movies on the hallmark channel, a place where every movie lasts at 90 minutes. If on Tuesday, He watched few films on the hallmark channel for a total 4 hour and 30 minutes. And then on Wednesday, he watched on the same channels twice as much movies as he did the previous day. What is the maximum number full-length movies, Grandpa could have watched on the first two days?\n\nAnswer: The answer is D) 15 Movies. The grandpa watched four movies on the first day and the same number two days after. So the time taken will be 4 hours and 4 hour for two more movies totaling 8 hours. Adding 4 more hours to 4 and 5th hour will make the total time 14 hours. The maximum number of movies is 15 and therefore option D) 15 movies are correct.\n\nAnswer: The max number can be calculated easily if we first subtract the 4.3 hr. it takes to watch 15 movies, each movie being of 90 minutes. So now we are left with 9.2 hrs. Left. Now 9.2 hs left is evenly divisible by 3 movies. So the max. no. of movies he can watch is 3.\n\nNow taking the 4 hrs. 30 mins. As an initial time, and then counting the time using formula: 2 (n) hrs where, n= movies that have been watched or remaining movies left to watch at a given point of time. So here 2.75 hrs. is the remaining movies (at maximum), So the total no. of movies that can be watched is: 2.75 x 3 = 8.25 and there it is option D: 8 movies\n\nAnswer: There are many steps to find the maximum number of movies Grandpa can watch on the first 2 days. Here is the math behind it:\n\nOn the first day Grandpa watches 4 movies: (90/60) \n\nOn the second day he watches the same number again.\n\n(So he watched total 4 movies):\n\nOn the 3rd day he watches", "answer": " 9"}

How do you create the largest burning flame possible with these resources?\n\n### Demostration : \n1. You start by attaching the lighter to the can with the help of a straw.\n2. Holding the cans close to the opening of a straw will generate enough air to produce a big\nflame.\n3. You can also add a straw to one of the cans in order to achieve the intended effect of creating a big flame.\n4. The flame is a burning reaction that occurs when the burning mixture of fuel and oxygen\nreach the gas phase in the form of gasses.\n5. The fuel gas mixture which has been lit is the most common type of the flame.\n6. There are two factors that must be correct for one to achieve bigger flame which are oxygen\nand fuel.\n7. It would be ideal that the fuel you are using has a large percentage of oxygen and\nthen the lighter that you are using should be lighted.\n8. The cans must then be separated by a certain distance so that each can can produce its\nown gas before this the mixture is lit.\n9. Both the cans should be given a constant amount of time to become filled with the gas\nwhich when combined with air will create a big fire flame.\n10. When we are talking of a large flame, this shows that it is bigger than the average lit fire flame.\n\n### Response : \n1. In order to create a burning flame of the largest, we will make use of one of the cans of gas in which a small hole is puched to light the gas.\n2.

He then catches it. Which point under his arm is closer to the original point?\n\n### Demo1: In the original, Bruce's entire arm span 100cm = 4x10cm  because it's a 2x2 square, that means Bruce's entire arm was 40cm high when the ball was at its maximum elevat\n\n### The point above is closer to the original position as Bruce moved his arm by 40cm while the ball's elevation was twice the distance from the starting point.   This means the ball fell twice as much as Bruce moved his up.\n\n### Demo2: Now if Bruce could only move his whole arm by 40 cm, the ball would only be affected by his hand's portion (10 cm height)  if everything was straight.

Next, we can write the cost of NY Striploin, after tax or inclusive of tax, as 80 and the cost of glass of wine, after tax or inclusively, as 10\n\n4.

{"text": "#### Input:\nThe given information consists of the 4 types of ingredients \u2013 strawberries, cream, raspberries, and ice cream.  We are first to ask how much would it cost, per quart, of the 2 ingredients whose quart amounts Martha desires.  To that end, we multiply the strawberry price of $3.00 per quart by 1 quart.  The result is $3.00.  Next, we multiply the quarts of raspberry ice-cream by $5.00.  This gives us $10.00.\n\nOur second calculation is the costs totals of heavy cream.  This involves multiplying the cream's price by 4, to produce the price of 4 quarts.  We calculate the cream's cost by first calculating its price, which is $4.00.  Our second step is to multiple the cream price of $4.00 by 4.  This makes $16.00 the price per quart from the price of $4.  To put it in context, 1 quart makes 1 half gallon of ice cream.\n\nWe have now calculated the price of berries per quart.  The third price calculation involves the same process, but on the raspberry ice- cream ingredient.  If the total cream cost is $16.0, then the total raspberry ice-ice-cream cost will be $20.00 (for 1 quart of each cream type).  From these two last calculations, we can see that the strawberry total cost is $3.0, and the raspberry total cost is $20.0.  This means Martha will pay $16.0 to make one-half gallon of strawberry ice-cream, and $4.0 for each half gallon of her raspberry ice-crream.  This means it cost Martha $30.0 to make 2 half gallons of raspberry ice - cream, while it cost $40.0 to make the strawberry ice creams.\n\n#### Rationales:\n1. It is clear that we can determine the cost of making ice cream, per quart.\n2. To do", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "Let x be the distance covered. The gas consumed is 'diluted' over the total distance covered. So gas used = d/(d+5) and d is the distance covered from home. So gas used = home+10/ home + 12\n\nRationales:1. The question is only about the rate in miles per gallons that Bobby's truck was consuming gasoline. It doesn't say anything about the total amount of gasoline.\n2. The first step is to find out how much gas is used for one round trip.\n3. This amount will also be the gas consumed for the second trip.\n4. This is because the total gasoline consumed equals the gasoline used for both trips.\n5. Therefore, the total gas that was consumed = trip (1) + gas consumed for trip (2)\n6. As we know that Bobby returned home to pick some farming tools, his return trip was 2 miles and so, he returns with 6 gallons of gasoline back to home. 7. So, for the second trip, trip (2) = home - 2\n\n8. Substituting this, it becomes: total gas used = trip (1) = total gas used = (home +10)/(home+ 12) \n9.

This increases the service time by 20%\n\nRationale\n1. The question is related to the time taken to serve a meal to all the patients in the ward, hence  it is related to the number of patients and not the time taken to serve them.\n2. The word'most' suggests that some percentage is not 1/3 but 2/3.\n3. 2/3 of the patients require special diet. This means that most of the patients require standard diet and 1/3 of the patients have special diet requirements.\n4. So, the question can also be stated as 'How long would it take to serve dinner to the remaining 1/3rd of patients in the ward that have special dietary requirement?'\n5. Since a standard patient is served in 5 minutes, one with special diet requires 6 minutes. Since 3/12=1/4, 1/4 of the patients would require special diet. Therefore, one with special diets require 3*6=18 minutes.\n6. Hence, It will take 18+5=23 minutes to serve to all the 12 patients.\n7.

The given information suggests that if we know 2/3 of a number, we can find the whole number of the given crane.\n2. The question asks us about the crane which is 147 ft tall and finishing a building which is 140 ft tall.\n3. Here the given information also provides the number of cranes which are used for the construction.\n4. Moreover, we can see from the given information which crane is 228 ft tall and which crane is 120 ft tall.\n5. The given information has a lot of the given information.\n6. Apart from the given information, the question also provides the average percentage of the cranes.\n\n### Solution:\n1. Let us assume that the crane has average height, which is h cm.\n\n2. From the given information, from the height of 128 ft to the height of 140 ft, we have average difference of 10 ft.\n\n3. Therefore, average difference is 10 ft. 5.\n4. Now, if it is given that the crane is 10 ft higher is not relevant, hence we will consider it as 10 ft shorter.\n\n5. By doing so, we will get an average height which is  228 ft to 120 ft.\n\n6. Therefore, we get an average height which the crane is, is 296 ft.\n\n7. The height of the building which the crane is used is 140ft.\n\n8. Hence, we find that the height of the building to which the crane is is 30 ft higher than the above average heigth or about average height.\n\n9. Therefore, the height of the building is 3 ft higher than the height of the crane.\n\n10.

To find the same, we can follow the following procedure.\n1) Initialize the sum of all elements of the list to zero. Let the new sum of all list elements be'sum'.\n2) Then, iterate through the list. For each element in the list, add it to the new sum. Let us call this new value'sum_new'.\n\n3) Then, divide'sum_new' with the length of the list (5 in our case) and obtain an average. In our case, the sum_new is 38, and length of the list is 5, so we obtain 7.6 per element.\n\n### Output: The average of the list is 7.6 This average is correct based on the methodology i just explained above.\n\n### Task:\nWrite a function named `avg`, as a `function` with a `parameter` called `list`, and defined by the `expression` `0 + list[1] + list[2] +.... + list[5]`.

If John has a novel every year, that is 5 novels in 52 weeks.  (Remember that each novel has 250 sheets per week.)\n\n1. Therefore, to calculate the total number of sheets of paper we require; we multiply the number of novels by the length in weeks.\n2. Given information: John writes 3 stories every month  each short story = (50 pages)  His novel is 120 pages per month (1200 pages in 12 months).\n3. Each sheet of paper can only hold 2 pages.\n4. We need, therefore; 3 * 50+ 5 * 120 to find the number of pages of short stories + the number of pages of novels in 5 weeks.\n5. So the total number of pages = 120 pages of novels + 1800 pages of short stories.\n6. The number of reams of paper, therefore, required to buy in a month = 500 pages per ream.\n7. So, the number of reams of monthly paper required = (1800 * 500).\n8. The number of sheets in a ream of paper = 500 sheets.\n9.

Considering the first comparison, the 4.35 miles away means exactly 7 kilometers and that is same as 0.29526 miles away.\n\n4.

Considering '4(four) + 00(zero) +.0625- centimetres' we can easily understand that 10 x 1000 = 10000= 1000 centimetres; 2 x 5 = 10; 0.06 x 625 means 3.75 cm.\n7.

So the number representing 0.06 centimres is 4352 while 4352.06 is 2952.6- miles.\n9. So option C is the best answer.\n\n### Answer:C", "answer": " 165"}

We use the given values to convert it into grams.\n     * 250 cal/fl.oz.\n     * Multiply by 29.2 (fluid ounce in 1 lb)\n     * => 7,336 cal/lb\n  4. Since 1 lb = 16 oz (given), and then\n     * 20 oz = 528 ml (water)\n       * 150ml = 15 g/100ml\n       * 7,337\u00f715: 498.9 g\n5. We will be comparing this value to the calories in the candies.\n  6. Since Mark took 43 candy bars,\n     * 24 oz = 680 g = 1.04 lb\n        => 1.04lb x 528 = 552.16 mg\n6.

A = Anything that is added with a letter or number is an operand.  B = Anything that are multiplied with a letter or number  is an operand. C  = Anything that divides anything with a letter that isn't a number is an operand but 1000 and 1 are not numbers  therefore we add them and take out the 1 like this 1100/1=1000. D  = Anything than subtracts something or a letter with a number is and operand to the answer. 1000\u00f71000=1.\n\n### Solution\nTo get the answer of how much 1000 number two pencils cost, you would start with ordering the three operands. You can solve this using PEMDAS which is parentheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction rules. 100 \u00f7 1000 will solve the division, but 10 \u00f7 1 will simplify the operation so 100 \u2044 10 = 10. If you divide 10 into 1000 it will solve the problem the same but you may still simplify. Now you know that 1000 \u00f7 20 = 50, so 1000 / 2 = 500 and 1000/ 10 =  100. Therefore, you can answer the question by multiplying 100, 1000, and 500 together to get the total costs of the pencils.\n\n### Answer\nThe answer to how", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "If his is selling 12 x 4 = 48 pictures in one month, he gets 12 * $60 +12 * $30 in total for 6 months, that amounts to $720.\n\n### Commentary:\nIf we think about this statement, \"If he sold twice as much\"? How could he sell exactly twice as many paintings and still sell 48 total? I believe that we can look at two months as two separate events. Therefore, let's just pretend that he sells 36 paintings in the first month and then in the second he sells 64 paintings. This is roughly twice as much as the first month, it's right around 20 extra. Now we know in the first month that he sold 8 extra paintings. So let's say he sold 96 paintings in the second month, how many extra did he sell? To figure this out, we can easily do a little calculation. To solve for how many extra he sold, we need to find how many total he sold in the first. We know that the month before he sold 8 extra, (not including the 96 in the second), totaling 96 + 96, so he sold 192 pictures in the second month, 96 + 192 = 288 paintings in total. So our number of extra paintings is 288 - 96 = 192", "answer": " 1200"}

{"text": "Keiko sent 162 text messages last week and this week.\n\n### Explanation\nInput: The question asks about the combined amount of text messages that Keiko sent last week and this week, where she sent 111 messages last week and 50 less than 2 times that number of messages. We can easily eliminate choices B, C, D, E, and F.\n\n1. Choices B and C both state that the combined total number of text messages is less than 110.\n2. Since last week, Keiko sent 110 text messages.\n3. Choice D states that the combined total number is equal to 150, which is incorrect since the weekly total number of messages is lesser than 150.\n4. Choice E is wrong since the overall number of text messages did not cross the 100 mark.\n5. Choice F is also incorrect in that it states that the overall number of messages sent last week and this can be either a 7 digit number or a 10 digit number.\n\nSo, we are in the scenario where the total number of text messages, excluding last week and this week is in the 60 - 69 range. By substituting choices D and E and plugging them into the equation that relates 125 to the number of text messages the question seeks, we can see that the answers are D: 120 text messages, E: 118 text messages, C: 139 text messages, and A: 200 text messages.\n\n### Detailed explanation:\nInput: The question states that Keiko sent 161 messages in total last week and this week; it also states that last week she sent 110 and this week, less than 2 \u00d7 110. As we can see from the question, last week she sent 6 messages less than 2 \u00d7 the total number of messages. Therefore, it follows that Keiko sent 50 less messages than she sent last week.\n\nFor all choices, choose the answer with the number of text messages that we have been given in the question.

Thus the answer to the question asked is Gary will have to pay $480 more per month if he repays his loan within 2 years as opposed to the time taken to repay in 5 years.\n\n\n### Input\nGary has an account with the bank.  His account has a balance of $3000.  His grandmother offers to loan him $800 and says, \"$400 after the new year, $300 next month, $200 in three months and $100 in six months.\" How much money does he have in his account after six months?\n\n### Demostration\nThe problem asks us to find out how much money Gary has in his account when six months are over.\n\n1. First of all lets sum the given amounts at the start of the loan, which is 800 at the new year, 300 the next month, 200 after three months and 100 after 6 months.\n2. We obtain 1260.\n3. Now, subtract the amount which Gary has taken as loan from the amount which his grandmother has given and the original amount in his account, that is 1260 - 300 - 30", "answer": " 150"}

{"text": "Basil\n\nIf Basil eats 1/2 a dog cookie in the morning, that leaves 1/2 a cooking for bed. This means there needs to be 5 full dogs cookies that she takes in. If she has 45 in a box then a box needs to last for 5 days (5 boxes x 9 per box = 45). We could then multiply the 5 by 7, since she has to eat 35 dog cookie in a month. 7 x 5 = 35. So we have 35 boxes but will need to round to the nearest integer. A box needs to last 40 days so she will need to eat 1 out of 1 box a day. We now know that she will have 40 days so we subtracted 1 and we get 39 which rounds down to about 41 weeks.\n\nAnswer: 10 x 41 = 410 Box.\n\nIf we take in to consideration we have a few extra and we add a few less days we may come up with a rounded number\n\n420\n\n### Input:(Anita, 189) (162, 189, 145, 148, 196, 191, 152, 185, 178) (175, 155, 170, 162, 211, 206, 167, 160, 161)\n\n### Response:(183)\n\nBy summing and subtracting I found that the difference between 98 and 148 was (50  - 50).

Since $a_2 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 120$, subtract one $2$ since it is in the number $120$. Add $2$ to one of the other numbers since the question states to add $2$ to each of the other numbers.

To do this, we subtracted $120$ from each of them first, and then we averaged each of the numbers by taking their sum. In doing so, we obtained $239$, the total sum of the original numbers.

{"text": "Answer: If Jeff spends 3 hours in catching up, he spends 13 hours working in an entire week. This may look a little complicated with a long number of hours. But it is simple. Here is the solution to understand the solution, Jeff spends 3/2 as many hours in the weekend during working as he spent working in a week by using the same amount of time. Jeff does 3/4 times more working every weekend than all the weekdays. Therefore, each working day, Jeff spends 4/3 times as much time working. Therefore, with 4 working days, he spends 4 * 4/3 = 4/3 * 4 = 13 hours in a working day. The amount of daily time spent for working in all the days, i.e, Monday through Friday, is 4 * 4 = 4 * 24/2 = 4 * 12 = 48 hours.

Suppose that the two ships run into each other 10 hours before they reach Mexico. How far north of California did they both get before they met up?\n\n### Rationales For Answer:\nIn general, the answer given the problem as 63. We can get there by considering what we know about the situation.\nWe know that the ship sailing south is going from California to mexico. The speed is 21 mph.\nSimilarly, the ship sailing North is also traveling from California to mexico with a speed of 14 mph (17 miles per hour -1).\nSince both ships are from California, we can subtract the amount of miles that the ship sailing North would have gone before the one sailing South got to Mexico and the answer would be the same.\n\nIf both ships started at California, that would mean the ship sailing north didn't start from mexico, but another far away location.\n\nTherefore, the ships started at two different far off locations: one from California and the other from mexico.\n\nIf both Ships started at far off locations, they started at opposite distances away from Mexico.\n\nThe ship sailing South started from -104 miles away (21*24=256), and the ship sailing north started from 6 miles away (-6).\n\nWhen the ships met up:\n\nThe speed of ship sailing South was 21 mph and when it hit the other ship", "answer": " 220"}

Since the answer for that is 41 and the price is 5.70, the second step would be to find a multiplication of the total number of hburgers and carrots which would be to 341x2.10= 5.70. The next step would be to take a multiplication between the price of hburgers and the total number of hburers which would be to 92.00 = 5.70 as they cost the same.

{"text": "Answer: 76\n### Explanation (Rationale):The question says, \"Of the 90 passengers on William's bus 3/5 are Dutch.\"\n1. Let us look up the equation of the fraction 3/5:\n2. There are \"3\"  numerators and  \"5\"  denominators 3 over 5.\n3. If we break down 3/5 into an integer and decimal, there are an integer of 27 and decimal of 0.4\n4. 27 of the people are Dutch among a total of 90.\n5. Similarly, for all of the remaining 63 passengers, the majority of whom are American, we have American=90, Dutch=27, remaining 63 are American.\n6. We know that 1/2 of Dutch=15 are also American.\n7. 21 (1/2 of Dutch Americans) chose window seats.\n8. That means the total of Dutch Americans seated at window seats is 46 (76-30).\n\nExplanation (Rationale for the response):The question says,\n\"Of the 90 pasengers on William's bus,3/5 are Dutch, and of the Dutch who were American, 1/2 got window seats\"\n\n1. 3/5 of 90 people is 36 or 16/5 in integer form.\n\n2. So there are total 64 seats on all sides and among these three 3rd seats are free.\n\n3. Here you can see that this question is about the third window seat.\n\n4. Therefore 3/5 = 1/3.\n\n5. Of the 15 Dutch Americans on the bus, there are 7 (1/2) that chose a window seat.\n\n6. So total of window seats for the Dutch Americans is 22.\n\n7. Here, the question is about the 3/5 of the Dutch Americans window seat.\n\n8. Therefore, there are 3 seat occupied, of which 22 is Dutch seating.\n\n9. So the number of Dutch Americans seated in the last window of the bus is 22 - 3 = 19. (Correct answer)\n\n### Instructions:", "answer": " 9"}

By looking at the prices of the goodies bags, the least amount she could spend on the goodie bag would be $175.\n#### Rationales:\n1. $30 for individual 5 packs of pumpkin themed goodie bags for 14 students is $420 in total.\n2. $30 for the individual 5 packs for vampire themed goodie baskets for 11 students is $330 in total.\n3. The least amount of money the students could have in total combined would be $750.\n4. $175 < $750, so 25 x $175 = is the least amount total she will have to pay.\n#### Explanation:\nThis is the case where you are given a situation where the total of both groups is $170. The remaining total after all students received their items would be $10 (less than 70). She would not have enough remaining money to buy a single $1 themed bag, so a $175 plan is better than choosing any other option.\n5. Therefore,\n$175 < $170 + $420 + $330 or\n25 x $14, $720 + $4262 =,\n=> 25 x $275 + $4263 > $1735.\n\n### InputThe same teacher asked her class of 30 students what their favorite color was for their individual Valentines cards.

So the total is less than 58 i.e. 56.\n\nB) The total number cannot 96, because Sam has 3x, which is 9, the total number is thus less than 96 i.e. 90.\n\nAlso, 2x of Steve is 12, and 12 is not more than 90, so it is not the correct option either B or C).\n\nNow, Steve cannot have 12 sticks at all if Sam has 3 times and Sid has 2 times. So Steve has at least 12-3=9 sticks less than the total sticks of both Sam and Sid.

The well has a maximum capacity of 180 gallons. You are able to fill the bucket with exactly 8 gallons of water. Each time, the bucket is completely empty of water, how many gallons of water will be in the bucket by the time you have filled it 10 times?\n\n#### Rationale:\n1. 180 gallon is the maximum capacity of the well.\n2. The bucket has a capacity of 8 gallons and is able to fill from the well.\n3.

Hence, our first step is identifying what the answer will be.\n\n### Question 2:If two events occur at the same time, and the sum of the number that occur at each event is three, then how many events will occur at both events?\n\n### Question: There is a table of data in a database that contains data of companies. From this data, we will find the top companies in the United States in 2018. One of the criterias for being a top company would be the net income of a company in 2017. In order to find the list of top companies the first thing that should be done is choosing the order in which the companies will be sorted. For this, we can think of a sorting algorithm that sorts by net income from highest to lowest or from lowest to highest. The companies can then be compared based on net income, and sorted in descending net income value, and then ascending net income value. If the first algorithm works and the resulting list has more than the desired number of companies, then a sorting method of comparing on the yearly income for the next year should be used followed by descending and ascending sort. If the first solution cannot sort based net income, we can compare the number of employees to sort high to low. Once the desired number of companies have been sorted, we can find the companies of the largest or the lowest.\n\n### Response::\nThe problem, as it is written, is missing some context, so it is hard to determine a valid response.\n\n### **[Input][1]**\nIf there's an algorithm that sorts some data, the algorithm must have pre-defined rules that dictates how the data will be sorted.

For this specific problem, I will multiply 800 by itself.\n\n### Response\nThe problem stated that the radius of an 12-foot sphere is 9 times the radiuses of the weight. From here 800 x itself is 800,000. When finding the circumference of a sphere, I will use PI as 3.14159... (it is only important to know that it is not a perfect 3.14).

Then, '3/4 of 40' which is '3 /4 \u00d7 40' is equal to'35'.   Hence, the number of present students is 35.\n\n3) The total number of students that are present is '35 + 4' which equals to '39'.\n\n4) Hence, the total number of students present in the classroom would be '39'.\n      \n5) The total number of remaining students must be equal to the number of absent students.

How can we cut a square (of 4 units)? Let's call its length H, so H = 2. We can cut off two sides of length 2, so we have two left sides and two right sides. So the two remaining sides (length 2.5) could be the two right sides.\n\nHence the first side length could be cut by two units and then turned to the second side and trimmed by 4 units.

{"text": "Hash's total toy count is 11 more than half of bill's total toy collection. Since bill has 60 toy, hash owns a total of 69 toys.\n\n### Discussion:\n1. The question states \"Hash\" and \"Bill\" who both have some toys of which Hash's 9 toy collection is less than half of Bill's total collection.\n2. From the above sentences, hash owns fewer toys than bill.\n3. Therefore, bill has a total of 60 toys.\n4. Now, hash has 9 more toys than half of bill' collection.\n5. To solve the question,we need to understand the term \"total\".\n6. So, We divide the collection of both boys in this manner:\n7. Bill's total: B = 60\n8. Hash' total: H = 9 + 60/2\n9. Combine both: H + B = 79\n10. Therefore, when Bill has 60, Hash has 9 more than half the total of 60.\n11. So Hash would have a total of 64 toys.\n12. Now that you have the total of 64.\n13. Add it to bills totoal of 60 and divide by total of 69 (Hash+ Bill's total).\n14. The result is 60/69 = 9/11.\n15. So Hash owns 9 more than 11th of the collection of Bill.\n16.

{"text": "Firstly, all the invitations are not going to accept. For example, he invited twice as many people from the school than from his hometown, it implies that about half of them are going to accept the invitation. We can safely assume that in total 20% are going to accept the party invitation. The number that has to be added in the first sum is hence 100-20 = 80.\n\nWe now have to consider what is the number of accepted invitations from the hometown. Out of 5 people, 1 from hometown is going to accept the invite, so here we have 4 more invites that are going to be accepted.\n\nAlso, from the school, 20 (remaining after half is already accepted) from 3 invitations = 20 invitations out of 3 from school are going to be accepted, so the number of accepted invites from school is 20.\n\nNow we have already calculated about 80 people accepting the invitation in total. The number left is 50 + 20 + 3 = 73. Hence the total number of people invited is equal to 50 + 73 = 123.\n\n### In-Class Questions\n\n### Inference Questions:\n* Q1: The given question wants to calculate the number of accepted invitation into a given party. Let us see what is the best method to estimate the answer. As the number of invitations is 2 times greater than the number of people to whom the invitees can accept it, we can roughly state that half is going to be accepted, i.e. 20%. This implies that the remaining number is approximately 30%. Since the number of invitations sent to school is equal to the number of invitations to hometown, the number invited from school is approximately the same as the number invited from hometown. Hence, the sum of the total number invited from school, and hometown will give accurate answer. We can solve the question by considering all those people invited from school and hometown and multiplying by.2. 120 + 120 = 240 *.2 = 48 \u2248 48.\n* Q2: After calculation, the correct answer is 73.\n* Q3: After", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "The push ups he started with were wall push-ups (or push-ups done on the wall), i.e. the starting point was wall push ups.  Once he completes his training, he can do floor push-ups (or floor exercises), where the highest point during the exercise is at his feet, and he is doing the actual push-ups on floor.  The 5 days per week schedule means he can complete some amount of rep each day, and by week n, he would have trained n/5 days.  But he doesn't start a push up rep of n until he completes the previous training.  So this means that it will take, at least, n/5 weeks (if he stops after every week of training) to complete a floor exercise.  And he adds 1 rep each time.

Then remaining leaves for three tea leaf plants are 12 + 12 + 6 = 30 green leaves.\n\n#### Solved:\n\nOne-half of the 18 on each of the three plants is 12 leaves each. Then remaining leaf for three tea leaf plants is equal to 18 * (3 / 2) which can be solved as the sum (3) with the count (2) of two times. The answer 18 gives 18 leaves to each plant.\nThus the correct answer would be the answer of partial which is 30 green leaves on the tea leaf plants.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn solving the first input, we take one-third from the total number of leaves and divide the number by two. Then we multiply the number with two to get the remaining number of leaves which is equal to 12 green leaves on each of three tea leaf plants. Then we will sum of the input which is 18, to get the partial answer 18 green leaves which is the input for the next part of the question. But to solve for the remaining leaves the partial answer must be multiplied with three. Therefore the total number of green leaf remaining are 30 green leaves in total.\n\nIn the second input, we can see that there are no fractions. We can do the same process as well as the input answer. 18 leaves are left and we can do any operation with the input in order to get the leaf count. So we take one-half from 18 leaves and multiply it, in this case it becomes nine leaves per plant. Therefore, there are nine green leaves which are left on each of the three leaf plants, but we can multiply input again to get ten green leaves left on each of the tea plant which is a perfect answer to the question.\n\nSo in this explanation we do not use any algebraic operation. But we do find one of the answers that is correct to a question.\n\n## Assessing\n\n\n- [x] This grade is for the assessment of your participation.

Here we have set up an equation to be solved with the algebraic method.\n\nRational:\n\n- 28+10-9=19\n\n- 25+(10-9)+9=34\n\n- 10-9+25=26\n\n- 65+26=91\n\nLet n=n where n is the largest number in the integer set.\n\nWe can replace n in our general expression as n in every possible combination\n\nn1 = n\n\nn2 = n+9-9=n\n\nn3 = n+9=n+8=n+17 - 9 + 10\n\nIn our table that is", "answer": " 42"}

This reduces to saying that she buys 75% more marbles than frisbees. We know that her initial number of frisbees is twice that of marbles. Therefore, by purchasing more cards and marbles, the total of their number will be 45. Answer: 45\n\n### Input and Demonstration:Given: There is a triangle with one side of length 10, two sides of length 4 and the third side of length 5. If the perimeter of the triangle is 18, what is the third vertex?\n\n### Rationale:Let ABC be the side lengths and ACX, ABC, ACD be the vertices. By considering alternate sides, you see that ACX is 18/3 units, which makes CX = 6. Now, if you do ACX = 6, you end up with a 120 degree angles. Now, we start out with a triangle where the sum of the angles is equal to 180. The sum of each side (2), the sum of the angles (180), the sum of the internal angles (540). Each side has a 40 degree internal angle. Because, the sum of the internal and exterior angles equals 2 x 40 + 4 x 2 + 4 x 30 + 180 = 420. Therefore, the sum of the angles cannot be 540 with sides of 10,4,5 but the other sides will have to be changed to reach the new numbers. Therefore, each side must be changed by 50 degrees; therefore, AC, BC, and CA will each have to have a 70 degree angle.

How much does Johnny save by using Jimmy's store?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe store across the street selling for $.15 per  ball, Johnny saves $.40 per  ball. Hence by using Jimmy's, Johnny saves by $4000.\nAnswer: $.40 per ball.\n\n### Input:\"Johnny's store uses an algorithm for customer service that is always 5% faster, but is five times more expensive.  Can the cost be worth it if the speed is  in excess of what the customer needs?\"\n\n### Demosration:\nThe question asks us about the efficiency and customer service.\nInput is: An algorithm is always a better option because it improves the efficiency.\nHence the cost can be paid because there would be some benefit for the customer as there would be better service and a good level of efficiency.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe answer to the given problem depends on several factors: the price of the item being purchased, the discount being offered, and the discount percentage itself. In this case, based on the given information and following the instructions, we can solve the problem by comparing several different prices for similar items. This helps to identify the best solution for the consumer by offering the lowest overall cost.\n\n### Solution:\nBased on the instruction:\nThe store across sells the ping pongs balls at $.15, while Johnny\u2019s store offers the ping pong balls at $.10. Johnny saves. If we multiply 5 by 10 then the savings = 50. This means he saves by $50.\n\nNow the question asks, the cost be worth it, when the speed is in excess of what the consumer needs:\nJohnny's store saves by $50, which is good for them. But if the speed is more than what is needed by the consumer then he should use that store, based on how much more savings they do offer.\n\n\n### Discussion and critique", "answer": " 700"}

There can be no partial days completed. Which expression will give the shortest time it can take \nTo complete the project?\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales:\n1. The student cannot be doing the work and still not complete it.\n2. So working less than full days cannot help.\n3. Considering this, one of the options is `x + y`. This is where the work has been complete in `x` days and the rest is `y` and it will still take a total `x + y` days.\n4. `x` cannot be subtracted from `x+y` as that will change the answer to `x` instead of `x+y`. This is the case for the two options that are both `x`.\n5. This is because `y` in the other two options is a  positive number, whereas `y` in the `==x+y==` option will not be positive.\n6. We can see that `y` is only 0 after some maths.\n7. If we subtract all the options together and then choose the least time remaining, that is the `y` \n8. In this case the `5*x` and `5*x+y` options are the shortest amount of time that it will take. That is `5*x=5` and `5*y=0` `5*` option.\n9. And thus the `5 * x` represents the shortest time to complete the project.\n\n### Answer:5x days\n\n### Input", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "If we assume the size of one card is equal to one toothpick as Eugene used all but one card and if one box contains 450 pieces and Eugene created a model house with 16 cards, we can see that it means he took 75 pieces of toothpaste from each toothpick and multiplied with 16 to make sure he got enough toothpick piles to build his house. Since 52 cards multiplied by 75 toothpick piles (taking 16 cards out) gives us a total of 4020. The number of boxes (since 1 box has 450 to the power of 1 piles) gives us 7.5, that means he used about 7 and 1/2 boxes, which makes sense because he probably had a few extra toothpicks in case something went wrong.\n\n### Input :\nGiven numbers that are divisible by three.

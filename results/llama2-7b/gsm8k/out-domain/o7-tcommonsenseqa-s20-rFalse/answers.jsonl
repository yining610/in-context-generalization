That means that the answer will be positive, so, our goal is to get this number into a form where the answer can be positive.\n\nAs it is, -40 * -27 * -35 = -55,800 \n\nSo we now need to make 55,80x into a positive number, and to do that we need to take that \"negative\" -55,8*60*60, and multiply it by 1 to get 330,000.\n\nWe then subtract 330,60, from our equation to end up with -329,600, and to take this to a whole number, we need to divide it by 10,0 as a whole number, we end up with -330 (33,000).\n\nA quick way to calculate this is to multiple each number by 10 to get a 3 place whole number ending in zero.\n\n-40 = 400\n-27 = 270\n-35 = 350\n\nNext, to get rid of the negative, we take it away with the subtraction -44 *24 =1212, which makes it into a positive number.\n\nNext, we multiply everything by 60 *60 to get 38,480, a 3 place whole ending in zero. we have a 39,5", "answer": " 2,250"}

So any one choice for any one side will be true.\n  B: This is not true.  One road may be added, this does not effect the sum of the hills on left/right.  Another road may be added but the sum of the hills only increases if they are added on a hill that did not have a road to start.  So it is not possible to have the sum of the roads match the sum of the hills.\n  C & D: Both these are always true.  The number of vehicles on the slopes of the hills are always the same.

What are the two numbers?\nOutput: 48 and 24\n\nIn our first task, we want to find the length of the pipe.\n\nThe diameter of the pipe we are trying to calculate the length is 32mm. A square metre is the area of one square meter (1x1).\n\nSo the area of a one meter square is 100m<sup>2</sup>. \nThe volume of a pipeline is: `volume = cross sectional area x length`\nThe cross sectional area of the pipe is the same as the area of a circle: `area of a circle = \u03c0 r<sup>2</sub> `, where `r = radius`.\nThe radius is one quarter of the diametre.\nSo the area of the circle is\n\n$$\n\u03c0\u00d7(32/4)<sup>2</su>\n$$\n\nThe square root of this number is 5.56. But is is a good idea to round up the square roots to the nearest two.\n\nSo `4/8 -1 = 0.5`.  \n  `32/4 = 8` is also `8 < 0.5` and the closest 8 that is larger than 0.5 is: `8 / 0.5 = 16` which is 16mm.\n\nThe closest 16mm square that is larger than 1 is: 17mm. So we pick 17.\nSo we are interested in the length of a 17mm pipe.\n\nThere is a second task. \nThe length of a fish tank is 84cm, what is the surface area?\n\nThe surface area of a flat surface of a square shape is:\n\n$$\narea = a\\times a\n$$\nwhere `a` = width of the surface\n\nAs there is a rectangle, the width of the rectangle is `8` which we will call the `lentgh`.

They were as different as night and day, and it was important for their father that each one got a fair share of his inheritance no matter how young, old, or how much family money each brother had. The day before he was set to die, their father gathered them together and asked them to tell him their names and ages. The oldest son, Thomas, said \"I am 30 years old\". The younger son, William, said \"I am also 30\". When the father asked James the youngest brother how old he was, James replied \"I am 16\". The father then said I know that Thomas and William are 30 of age, but tell me James, how old is Thomas? In how many summers has he been 30?\n\nThe father looked at James with confusion. James shrugs his shoulders and says with a smile, \"Never mind Dad, I'll just go and find some corn and get it ready for supper; you guys can explain what I said after I'm gone.\"\nThomas says, \"Dad, James is two summers short of being 30. Thomas is 32; William is also 32; and I am 30.\"\n\nFather looks at Thomas and William and says, \"Thank you, thank you; I see now.\"\nThe father then died and all three brothers inherited what they thought was their rightful share of the estate: $5,000, $10,000, and $40,000 respectively.\n\nThe following morning, Thomas was thinking about how he was going to use his $5,00o. He decided he'd take the bus to work (as he had done for the last three months) and had a look around for all the discarded bottles lying about on the side of the road. He picked up all of the ones he could and sold them to the local drinking establishment, which paid him $600 for the bottles. After he paid back what he borrowed", "answer": " 705"}

{"text": "2\n\n#### Explanation:\n###  In the first question,\nThe word \"the machine\" refers to the entire sentence. The entire sentence has been defined.\n\n### In the second question,\n\"Where do you get petrol?\" is a question, not an exclamation. So the sentence needs an actual answer, which is why you need a full sentence to be correct. \"Burn hot\" is two words, but that makes no sense as the response to the question, unlike something like \"B: fuel tank\", or \"D: car\".\n\n### In he third question,\nThe word \u201cwhat\u201d refers to the answer. The answer should be \u201cuniversity\u201d since it makes sense to say where something was gathered.\n\n###  In Question 5,\n\u201cWhere are small grapes\u2026\u201d is asking for the name of a place, not a type of something. So the answer would be a place. \n\n```\n      |     Grapes: A B C D E\n```\n\nFor this reason, answer D (bedroom) is correct, since \"grapes\" cannot be obtained in a \"bedroom\".\n\n###  Question 6,\nThe way \u201cAll people are \u2026\u201d is a question. The word \u201care\u201d is pluralised, and thus an S-V pair is required, as indicated by the comma after \u201care\u201d.\n\n###  The last question,\nFor a sentence to function properly, it needs to have a subject and be grammatically correct. If you remove the \u201cshark\u201d in the sentence, you\u2019ll be left with simply, \u201cIf you are betting \u2026\u201d which is not grammatical.", "answer": " 5"}

How much more do you pay if you take one more pill? That is $19.50.

So, the last ball will have 10 times yarn as the second ball and in turn 2 times yarn as the fourth ball. The question states that it required 27 feet of Yarn to get the 3rd ball.

We can assume that half of the bag is 6 kilos, how much is 6 kilos of sugar?\n    How much is `6` kilometres? (Answer: `Six kilometres` is the unit that shows how much 6 kilos is)\n\nTherefore, what is `6 kilometres` equals `6.000 gr` (unit is kilometres)\n\nNext, the `X` is `6` kilos\n\n`X` is divided by `0.5`.\n\n`0.3` is what is the remainder.\n\nSo, `0.3` is the amount of `300 gr'`\n\nWhat is `1 kilo` of sugar equals (Answer: `1 kilo` equals `10^2 gr`)\n\nSo what is `1000` gr's divided by `300`? (Answer: `[Math]` equals to `2.667`)\n\n`2667` is equal to `266.7 kilo's`.\n\nWhat is `72.6 kilo's`? (We subtract", "answer": " 21"}

The question is that there are 20 layers but in the question, they said that there was (5. 4, 4, 4. 1. ) and I don't know why, that they said that, but one rock out of the 20 can't be more than one kind so I was thinking they mean, \"How many kind of rocks make up only 1 layers of rock in the canyon's strata?\".\nSo since 5 is more than 1 so they must be thinking that this time how many kind of rocks make only one layer in the cayon's strata. So we can say that there were 15 layers, that's 5 + 4 + 4 + 2 +1. Now 15 - 5 =10. We know that there are 15 layers now we have to calculate how many layers have 1 rock in it now they mean sand stone, shale, quartz sand, and limestone. We have to take the rest of the layers for now 10 - (1:10) = 9. So there are no more sand stone, so we can say from sand stone = 9 sand stone is sand stone. From shale, shale = 8. Now there are quartz sand, quartz sand = 5. Now how many layers have only limestone? 10 - 9 - 8 - 5 = 7 layers have only limestone. But we are not done yet. We must know that all the 7 layers that have only limestone is how many layers that have 1 kind of rock? 7, yes 7 that means 7 - (limestone = 7). So 7 - (limstone = 7).

{"text": "$0.25\n\n### Explanation: Here's how I'm arriving at my answer.\n\nI started with $100.00 then started by putting the poster as $0.25 and noting that the rest left over went into the next part.\n\nI was unsure of how to subtract the $20.00 from the $100. So I figured (179.50 - 100 = $79.50. 4 + 0.75) That's where I got stuck.\n\n$56.75 I figured subtracted $20 and added the.25 to the $31.75 and said I was finished.\n\nI also didn't know how I could do $0.25 x $2, I was confused. So I decided to subtract $22.50 because they subtracted $20.\n\n$\\frac{0.25 x 2}{.25} = 5.00$\n\nHere's where I got lost again. I thought:\n\n$5 x $1.25 = $6.25\n\nSo then I decided to take the cost of the notebooks off my total because that's what was remaining, that's when I came up with $0.25.\n\nI also realized I was still missing some money. So the rest of the money was what I had left. So let's say I had $2.20, and I subtracted that $4 with the.20 left.\n\nSo I figured the rest would have to be.20. That makes a total of 5 dollars.\n$2.20\n\nTotal left-over:  $0.20", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "We can write this problem as a system of equations, which we will refer to the next section.\n\n### The system of equations we are interested in is:\n\nLet S be the set of all blue liquid without copper in it.\n\nAnd:\n\nLets say that if one beaker has 2 drops of solution, another has 3 drops, and an ith beaker has `d` drops of solution, all we know is that there at least one drop of solution added to each beaker, and that `d` of those beakers contain copper ions.\n\nSo the general equation for this is:\n\nBased on the instructions, we use the fact that we have found 45 drops in the 22 beakers to write down, `22-45/2 = 13`. If we assume that this is the number of liquid beakers without copper in them(which we have not proven), this can be used to replace `d` in our equation with `13`, and we get that:\n\nNow we must multiply this equation by `6` to determine how many beakers contain copper. To do this, we first multiply this by `8`, because we have 8 beakers that could conceivably contain copper ions:\n\nIf we subtract this from the first equation, we get that `(845)/13 - (871)/13 = 0`. This means that we have at least 17 beakers that have both copper and blue liquid in them.", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "Bran does not need to pay anything because he has taken care of the fee through his scholarship.\n\n#### HINT: The question uses the statement \"within 3 months\", so it can be concluded that $120 of the scholarship ($90+$15) were taken after 3 months, and $80 of the scholarship, which is how much is the scholarship after reducing the 3 months payment, needs to be paid.

But we are told that Bran should only pay for the remaining fee, which is how much?\n\n#### Solution: Let y = scholarship; x = scholarship used. Bran did a part-time job every month that pays him $120 after subsidizing his fee; So the scholarship used = $90+120= $210 Bran's fee is still $85, so in other words we need x = $85-210.

The salesperson tells her that the sale is for the first 60 feet, and that everything after the first meter is going to cost $64.  How much is Eve going to budget for her office?\n\n### Resuonse:\n\nWell the cost of 12 x 13 is equal to 13 x 12.  You are purchasing 200 sq ft, but I am going to split into 2 100 sq ft.  The salesperson said that the first 60 of the 13 x 9 was going to cost $315 and the remainder is going to be $64.  Now since you are splitting the 200 square feet into 2 12 footers, you can plug them in and get the sale price, $4670.  That takes care of the first 100 square feet.  For the 2nd 100 square, it costs $64.  64 x 100 is going to cost $100.00.  Eve has spent $5,670 on her tiles.", "answer": " 135"}

Conversely, others choose to simply turn their left foot out. This leads to an interesting question of which position creates the faster run: one where the left foot is pointed out or one where both feet are parallel to each other. To investigate, two runners each run a 1600-meter distance at their own preferred pace. Each runner then switches up his stance, changing which way he points his left foot. Which stance results in a faster run?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nTo answer this question I had to solve all the question by using the data the gave. I started with 300 meters each as one step. Which means that if both feet are parallel to the ground each runner will have 600 meters total over the distance run. And if one foot is pointed out and the other kept parallel to the ground then each runner will have to complete 640 meters over the distance run. When doing the math the total distance will be the same.\n### Solution :\n\nThe question to be answered is what gives the better pace and result if you change from one stance to another. To make the math more simple all distance ran can be equal to one step and for the same result. Example: The distance ran can be 10 meters but if they turn one foot out the total amount of steps taken will stay the same but the distance travelled will be larger. For the same distance a round trip travelled you need 14 steps to do it if both feet are parallel and only 12 steps to do it if the feet are turned out. In short the math for each starter is that it is easier to change when you turned out your right foot and harder", "answer": " 20"}

So if this case 1 page equal in each day then\n\npages read by 10/1=10 (number of days) /10 (pages) =1/1=10 pages/day\n\n---\n#### ## Solution :\nyasna reads 180 pags in 8 days. remaining one book in 2 days. so to get answer we need only to divide to how many days it takes to read each page. Let us assume if yashna reads one complete book in 8 days than 8th day is the last day to read two book(first one in 8 days and 2nd one in 2 days). So 8days/2days(which is same as 8/2 and 8 divided by 2) = 4. since it's multiplicatively. So in each day she has to read two times firstly she has to read for 180 p. Then she has to read for remaining 50 pages. So 180 first 50th which is 50th part of every day which is divided by 50 divided by each day which is 50/8. so we get 6.25 p/day this is the answer.", "answer": " 20"}

To compute the likelihood that both lawsuits get paid out, one may consider the amount he can receive if he loses one lawsuit, and then compute the likelihood that he only receives $7,999,999.\n\nWe can compute the amount in case that Andy loses one of his lawsuits as follows:\n$$(1 - 0.3) \\times 8,0000,017 = $1,500,007$$ This is the amount that Andy would receive if he losses one lawsuit.\n\nTo compute the likelihood that Andy only receives $8,007,995 for a loss, we can use the following formula and plug the values into the formula: \n$$P(8,0007,965)=\\frac{{8,007995}^{2}}{8000017^{2}}$$. Here, we can substitute $C$ for the number of choice, as it will be helpful to remember the values we will receive for different choices from the formula. \n\nAfter performing the above operation,the answer is $3.04\\%$.\n\n#### Solution 2\nTo compute the likelhood of losing both lawsuits, Andy may compute the amount that he receives when he loses one of his Lawsuits, and compute the liklihood that he does not receive anything.\n\nWe can plug in the values and compute the amount he receives if he loses one of the lawsuits: \n$$(0.8 \\times 8000000) - (0.3 \\times 8069997) = 7999995 $$\n\nThe chances that Andy gets this is:\n```\n    $P(\\frac{7965}{800017})=\\frac{7967^{2}}{80017^2}=\\sum{0\\cdot \\frac{(800016)-(7965)^2}{80017}}=0.0304$\n```\n\n### Instructions", "answer": " 20"}

We need to do the same with the number of words below the line.\n\n6 - (7 - 6) = -1 + (8 - 9) = -7 = 1 less than our total of 6\n\n7 - (8 - 7) = -1 + -2 = -3 + -1 = -4 = 3 greater than our total of 7\n\n\n13 - (9 - 13) = -4 + -10 = -14 + -4 = -18 = 5 greater\n\n\n13 + 7 = 20\n\n### Solution5\n\nSubtract the total number of words above the top line that are in sequence from the total number of words below the top line that are not in sequence to get an answer of 6.\n\n### Summary", "answer": " 30"}

Let\u2019s take another look at that problem. Here it is again:The total of 6, 12, and 2 is (6 + 12 + 2) = 12. Subtracting 12 from the total gives us 12 \u2013 12 = 0.

{"text": "Wickham needs 97 plates.\n\n### Explanation: He needs 97 plats.\n\n### Input\nInput: An antique dealer had a very large antique doll collection. There was a box of dolls that he estimated to be worth at $1,000. On top of the box was a smaller white antique box that he thought might be worth $10. Inside the smaller box was a tiny jewel. What is the probability that the antique box of dolls is completely empty?\n\n### Demostration: \nIn my demo i picked 10,000 random dolls and made a new random number from the list of dolls that was equal to the estimated value of the box (40) then the resulting the dolls in his collection was completely empty!\n\n### Instuction: \nPlease find the probability of the collection being completely empty or not.\n\n### Response\nAnswer: Wickham needs a total of 97 plates (15*3*2).\n\n### Examples\nThe following examples demonstrate solving the given problems. You should attempt problems similar in approach as those you have tried on this assessment.\n\n* In the first example there were 30 people who attended and half of them (15 guests) brought along a plus one, for a total of 60 people.\n\n* In this example there are 60 people and 7 courses.\n\nWhen adding all of these together you get a final answer of 97 (15 people x 4 courses + the number of courses) = 125. There is therefore an extra 26 people to account for with the plus ones, which makes the total 151 plates (4 plates for one person + 15 plates for the other people) = 98 plates for the host and 53 for the guests. Plates are never used twice so this takes you to 97.\n\n* In example 2 there was one plate used 3 times meaning there were 28 people.\n\n* This example was similar to the previous one as there are 6 tables.\n\n* All 60 places were accounted which led to the final answer of (53 + 53 + 52 + 50 +", "answer": " 135"}

Since it says how much less, the answer is 243.\n\nUse the process of elimination to figure out which is the missing number. You only subtract or don\u2019t subtract when you are told to do so.\n\nAsk what is missing.  \n-223 \u2013 20 = 0\n\nSo the answer is 20.\n\nFor example:\nYou have a dollar and buy 20 candies. At the end of the day you have $10. It asks: How many candies were bought?\n\n1. Ask what's left. One dollar left.\n2. Ask what number to subtract. The number to subtract is 20. Since 20 was the number of cnandies bought. \n    20 - 20 = 10. \n    1 - 1 = 0. The answer is none. There are not any candies left.\n\n### Input:\"Ali and I went to McDonald's and got a milk shake, three burgers, six chicken nuggets and fries to go. We spent $15 on dinner.

So how could it possibly be wrong? So after this I spent every free and pre-determined lunch break with this woman teaching her math. The way I teach is by questioning the question itself, because the answer is always found there at the root of the question. But to answer this question appropriately you're going to have to question my questions. Here I'll give you an example and let you use the process described below.\n\n### So how many days, do you think, is it going to take for the baker to bake the loaf of bread?\n\n### Bonus Trivia ANSWER: You can't answer YES or NO. So after the baker goes to the bakery he'll have to take out the dough, prepare it, cook it in the oven and take it out when it's ready to be baked. So that will take a bit of days. So you can put 1 day since bakers go to the bakery, and then put however many days it take to prepare the dough. So say the dough takes an hour to prepare since you have to throw everything on the sides and prepare. So you prepare for 1 hour, and then it takes 1 day to prepare and bake it on a pan, and then take it out of the box. So put one day for the baker to do the work, and however many days it takes for him to bake it and then take it out. Since it takes 24 days for the loaf of bread to be b", "answer": " 347"}

{"text": "$45$ seconds\n\n### Explanation:\nThere are $9$ months in a year. For $45$ seconds to be a percentage of $9$ months, the value should be in the range $[0,50)\\%$. \nSimply put, $45$ seconds is greater than $600$ seconds, therefore it is greater than $50$ seconds. \nTherefor $45$ seconds $< 50$ seconds.\nThis means that for $45$ seconds, it is less than half of a year.  To determine how to translate this into fractions, we notice that $45$ seconds of $9$ months is equal to $80/480$ or $1/6$.  This means that $45$ is $1/6$ of $9$.  Therefore we have $45/600 = [45/6\\cdot 100]\\% = 1^{\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 100\\%} \\approx 0.166\\%$.\n### Input:How many months are there in $2021$?\n\n### Response\n$13$ months\n\n### Explantion\nThere are $13$ months in $2020$.

{"text": "They spent a total of $19.\n\n### Explanation:\nRiley rode the space shiutle four times. So the total cost for Riley's ticket for the Ferris wheel was 3x5=$15, and then add for the space shuttle which is 4x4=$16. The grand total for her is $16 + $16 = $32.\n\nMara rode the bumper cars two times. She rode one time after the space shuttle, then she rode a second time after the Ferris wheel. So for Mara, she spent 3x5=$ 15 for the Ferris wheel and 3x2=$6 for the space shuttles, then add 5 for the bumper car, and that's all for Mara. That's a total of $21.\n\nRiley rode the bumper ball three times, the total is 3x2 since 3x5 doesn't apply because Mara rode three times, not Riley. Mara rode the space shuttled 4 times, so for Riley total is 4x2=$8.  And Mara rode the bumber car 2 times so Riley's total is $8 + 6 = $14.\n\nThen add Mara's total to Riley's total and its $14 + $19 = $33\n\n### Extra Notes:\n**If you have to use your own calculator, I encourage you to try to figure it out without doing so.**", "answer": " 50"}

When people never disagree, the relationship can't possibly be that real.  She'll get upset and think, well at least she has a mother who loves her, regardless of anything else.  That's dangerous, because she won't be able to get close to someone else.  If she were to get angry with someone else, she'd be forced to have an authentic relationship, because she couldn't be sure that she could rely on her mother.  A relationship made only of love means nothing.  You think you're having a successful mother-child relationship, but you're really just fooling your daughter, because your relationship is one-sided.

Be sure to follow each link to brush up on any concepts that you are not as familiar with.\n\n\n### Strategies\n\nThere are many different strategies that can be used to determine the optimal, or most logical, choice to make. Including the information you have in context, is a critical step in the decision making process, when selecting the correct response. You can consider the entire problem statement, or parts of the problem at a time. You need to use all of the words in your cue to make a logical determination about the response.\n\nThe following sections examine each concept with supporting examples, followed by instructions on how to apply and practice each strategy.\n\n### Use Context\nThe following is an explanation of how to incorporate information into your process of picking a correct answer.\n\nWhen completing a word problem, the first step is to read and understand the problem as a whole. In addition, read and understand each single word used. Then, you can combine each single sentence into complete context. The correct answer will utilize all of the information used in the original problem. The following instructions contain examples with explanation.\n\n### Example:\n\nSay the person you are interacting is in prison.\n\nInput: The monkey was playing on the roof.

Therefore, there is no verb associated with the noun, \"monkey.\"\n\nRead the entire sentence. You know there is an action. The monkey does something that we don\u2019t know what he is doing. Then you can pick the verb to complete the sentence.\n\nAnswer: B: doing what?   \n\n### Demystify\nAfter you understand the problem and gather the necessary information, a next step is to decompose the problem into basic concepts.

Of those who are not married, one third live in condominiums and the rest live in townhouses. Of those who live in townhouses, 10% are singles. If all these statements are true, what is the percentage of individuals who are not single?\n\n### Solution:\nThe percentage of total non-married people that were singles, (13% of 30%), was (30% * 13%) * (10%). The total amount of houses in the population was (30% of 100%) * (13%). Which can be simplified to (30%*0.13*1)*. Therefore, 3.9% of the population is not single.

We will first do the Chinese number system for 7 because this number will need to be converted into the animal counting. First, the number 7 is to be divided into the number system of china; 7 is divided into 7 different values. Each value is assigned a different number. We put 7 into the counting table given. 7=6 =3 =2 =3 =1 =4 Since the given numbers of animals is in increments of 1. 7=6=5=4=3 =2 =1 =0 0=4=3=2.7 7=.7\n\n### Response 7\n\n### Input\nThere are 290 houses in the street at 1m, 1n, and 10w away from the post office, and 425 houses in the street at -2m, -1n and 9w away from the post.

He wants to give out samples of marijuana to potential customers. What is the smallest sample that has a probability of getting sold if he gives it a random person?\n\n### Demostration\n\n```\nAnswer: First write your math out in order for the program to know what you are doing. For instance, your question is how to find the minimum sample which will likely be sold. To do this you can take a sample of the smallest number of baggies. For instance, 1 baggie. You can then find out the probability of this sample selling. In this case it would be equal to 1/10 because the probability is 1 out of 10 people will buy if I give this sample of marijuana to them. You then want to find out how many samples you can afford to give each person and still be expected to sell at least 1 bag. For instance, 6 baggies. The reason why this number is 6 is because 1/10 x 6 = 1, this is because 1 out of 6 times you will sell at least 1 baggage. This is why you should not be giving out more than 6 baggies and if your number is larger than this, then you will know you need more baggies for each potential customer.\n```\n\n# Task", "answer": " 54"}

The player started out with 100 makes in a row. As seen in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/dejanstanar/how-we-broke-the-record-for-the-most-consecutive-shots), the number of consecutive shots increases by 1 each day. This can easily be observed by taking the previous number of consecutive shots and adding the number of days i.e. 1.\n\nHowever, this does not take into account the time factor that a player, even though skilled, might not be able to make that many consecutive shots in a day i.e. 24 hours. Therefore, the player has to wait 46.5 days to be able to try and break the record.\n\n### Reference:\n\n[https://www.kaggler.com/dejanstamar/how-we-cracked-the-record-of-the-most-continuous-shot/](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/questionning/classroom-discipline-questions/)", "answer": " 300"}

The second book sold for 8 dollars less than the first. The whole sale value of the books is 143.75.

{"text": "Melissa wants to get more people to see her dresses, however, in order to be successful, she needs a lot of time. Each person attending the festival will pay $5.65 per dress (the prices are so high to avoid losing money). Melissa needs to make at least 9.685 dresses so that she earns enough money. Melissa understands that her efforts will not get the job done in the time she is allotted.\n\n**Additional instructions**\nThese are just some of the options that may be presented in the input. In order to get the job done, Melissa realizes that she will first need more fabric. She purchases more fabric (495 square meters total if she is able to buy any at all). Now she knows that it will be more difficult to get the work done, but she hopes her increased resources can help make her work. She knows that it's nearly impossible to make at least 10 dresses without the help of a large group of people. She decides to invite 50 of her friends to the festival to help complete her first dress. She estimates the time the first dress will take to be 7.125 hours. Melissa knows if she is not able to get to the point where she can make 10, that she's not going to be able to achieve that goal at all.\n\nOnce her friends arrive, it turns out they can make only 7.089 dresses (46 total) before the 3 hour time limit is up. Melissa is crushed, but it turns out for her second dress, things are going much better! Her friends are better at making dresses, so she gets to the point where she is able to make at least 3 dresses. Melissa was finally able to accomplish her goal, so she starts to get to the first set of 9.68 dresses (9.68 x (56/4) x 3). But alas only 17.344 make it before the time limit expires.\n\n### Solution:\nIt would cost $15.29 per person to buy fabric. It costs $13.13 per dress, which is a total of $13.120. There will not be enough money left to cover that.\nWe can get 46 dress", "answer": " 42"}

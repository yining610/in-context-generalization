The first is the fact that we will need to check if the answer to each of the questions we were given is one given in the  answer variable.\nThe second problem is that each line is different and we need to check them individually since each question may have different given answers for each.\nIn the first line we will need to check to see if the given answer is among which answers have been given. Then we will need to set the correct variable such as the \"C\" variable. In the second we will do the same thing\n except we will use \"B\" for the variable because the given answer is b\nAnd then we will continue to go on like this until the last line.\n\n### Solution\nI first made a function with parameters for the variables \"A\", \"B\",\"... to be used like this:\"\n\nFunction: check_answers(data,answer,letter,i)\nWhere i is the number of the question, data is the data with answers and letter is for a variable (like C for check letter).\n\nCode:\nvar check_answers= function(data,answer,variable) {\n    for(i = 0; i < data.length; i++){\n        if (data[i] === answer) { \n            variable = \"right\"", "answer": " 20"}

If all that we care about is what answer we can get, then we can use the fact that there are 100 different questions and use brute force to come up with the solutions.\nThere's 100 questions in total but for efficiency, it's probably best to write a different solution if you're trying to maximise your answer points from each question and not simply trying to brute force them. What would those solutions be for? There's only a few question types which we will consider here, the first one being \"A: movie theatre B:university C: park D: Alaska E: Country\". We know that there are only 5 potential answers, but we have 100 questions.\n\nSo what to do? We can think about each character as a digit in our 100 question answer and come up with the next digit. To do that, we can use the knowledge that we can ask for the same question 4 different times and get 4 different answers. Therefore we can use what we know about these answers to help maximise our answer value for each question.\n\nExample: C: parks - we only need 2 of the 4 possible answers, which means that the other answers are A, B, E. The next answer will be between these last 3 choices.\nExample 2: D: Alaska - We need ALL of these 4 possible answers - these are the only ones we have for parks, so they are the only ones that could help us determine the next answer.\nEtc. Do this for all 100 questions and you will then be able to work out the correct answer or answer key without running into duplicate choices.\n\n\n##### Solution: 3rd Question\n\nThinking about which answers lead to which other answers will help here, as well.\n\nExample: Movie theatre will only lead to either universities or parks as the answer\nExample: University will only help you with parks or alaska, but can't help you with Parks as they will result in the same.\nSo here we have 4 possible choices for a universities, but it will ONLY ever be between two of those choices (parks, alaska).\n\nNow we", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "A: 78 minutes\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFirst Step: input the number 6, then multiply the first digit, in our case 6, by 5, that is 6 \u00d7 5= 30, then add by the next digits, so that's 30 + 4 = 34, in our case for the 2nd digit.\n\nAfter that, we add the first digit to the last digit, so from 6 we get 7. Then we add 30 and 7 that is 37.\n\nAfter that we will get 1 digit, which is 3.\n\nNow we multiply 3 with 5. The result is 15.\n\nAfter that add 0 and 1 that is 1.\nThe result of this step is 66.\n### Explanations:\n\nIn the first step, we have 6 characters to be read as a number, which in our case is 648, then convert the digits to the integer form, that is 648 in integer form is 64800, 648 with an integer value of 6. So, for each character in the number, you multiply it with it's position (6)and then add 6480, which is in the 11th position.\n\nThen take the integer of the result which in our case is the 2nd digit, which is 2.\n\nThen you multiply every character's integer value of their position by the 3rd digit which is 9, then add them.\n\nAfter that take the 2nd digit and multiply it by 7 that is 14.\n\nFinally take the 3rd digit and put a zero and then add the other result, which is 28.\n\nAfter that you should get 27. The result is 27.\n\nThe process was basically the same, only the numbers were different.", "answer": " 54"}

Second, there is no chance.  Third, there should be one person on each team. The first team must choose one player for each house and hotel, paying $100 for each. If they wish, players can choose their own monopoly (by typing which one they wish), and their team will own it. (In other words, you can\u2019t have your team own Marvin Gardens and Boardwalk, or go to jail.) Fourth, after a player rolls the dice, he/she may then choose from any property to which they own a monopoly (whether it be Atlantic Avenue or St. James Place, or even all the railroads.) If they do, they get to keep that property for the entire game. (The game is 20 dollars a player, so $200 total.).  Fifth, at the end of the game, for one hour\u2019s worth of the game, each player gets to keep $25. If the game takes 10 hours, each player must pay $50 per hour, meaning that each player has to pay $500 or make $500 worth for the game.

Some countries put speed limit to 50 km per hour because of the concern the environmental hazards of high speed, but I think 20 km every hour, which is the middle speed limit of them, is good for everyone, environment, human, and traffic rule.\n\nBecause, most serious accidents occur between the speed limit of 20km/hr and 30 km/hr. The report by UK's Department for Transport states that there were more than twice as many accidents each year on the road between 20km/ph and 30 km. Even on highways where speed is not an issue, drivers have to slow down after passing a village or town. At such times, many motorists fail the most basic test of roadsmanship by stopping properly for the sign indicating the end of the danger zone.\n\nIf we make a speed limit 5km/hr for city area, the traffic jam, which is now", "answer": " 730"}

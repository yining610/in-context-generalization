Since he made twice as many invitations for his hometown as the number of people, he made 2 invitations per person from hometown- giving a total of 2 invitations for every 2 people. Therefore Martin invited 20 invitations for every 10 people. Finally 108 is the answer because the remaining invitations represent 15% of the total previously given (10-((2x2)+1.5)).

Then, we multiply 7 by 2 because the word 'times' is in the question, and the words 'times' and '2' are synonymous.  The answer is 14 miles.

Two cubes have each person's initials on the side, one starts with A, and the other with X. Each cube has a different color on the outside. Each person hides inside one of those cubes. Each group member can leave the cubes and hide inside of someone else's cube. One person always knows where you are hiding, but it's not the same person who can always find you. The seekers always know who did what. However, all of them are playing at the same time, without talking to each other. The task is as follows:\n### The seeker's group wins if they can find you.\n### The hiding group wins if they can go one hour without the seeker's group figuring out their hiding spot.\n### You can only leave your hiding cube. Only two players can know what color cube you are in. If a player knows where you are. That player is not allowed to tell the others.

{"text": "### Answer:\nThere is an even distribution of cars driving down Happy St. from Monday to Friday. There is an increase of cars drive down Happy St. On the weekend by 2. Therefore, if we assume the cars drove at the same rate on the weekend as during the week and 2 additional cars on the weekend, we can find how many cars per day on average per week. 1 day in the week has 25 cars and 5 days has 10 cars and 2 days had 50 cars. Thus, we would divide 100 by 25 which yields 4. We then divide 4 by 5, which results in a 50% increase. 50% of 25 is 12.5. Then, we multiply 12.5 by 4 which results in 50.125. Our answer is more accurate than we would get from rounding, because rounding would increase the 3.125 by more than 0.125 to 3.25.

One method of removal is to plant trees. To produce each tree, it costs $15. As each tree grows and produces fruits, it removes one pound of pollution. Trees grown on an acre of land can remove one pound of pollutants in the first year and another pound in the second year. The government wants to completely remove pollutants with a certain number of acres. As a consultant, you have been hired to evaluate their needs. 1. Given the following information find the acreage of land needed to cleanse all the pollutants (pollution removal): \na. Tree costs $15 to produce  b. Removes 1 pound of pollution in the first year  c. Removes 2 pounds of pollution in the second year\nc. a. b.(15,1) c. 0.8 (6,1)\n\n2. If the government is only able to plant one acre rather than the acreage previously requested, how many more trees will have to be planted to cleanse all the remaining pollutants? Solution: Tree costs $15\nRemoves 1 pond of pollution in the 1st year\nRemoves 2 pounds pollution in the 2nd year\nSo far, (4 - 1 = 3) 1 pound left\nSo we plant three more.\nSo it takes 4 + 3 = 7\n\n\nSolution: 15,1 6,1 \na(", "answer": " 50"}

After having a few ideas, I picked two of them and started to write them down on paper, while solving and making a realistic calculation for the first solution. The second solution needed more thinking and calculating then the first, due to there being more people and baggage on the plane. For each solution, I drew a Venn diagram on how the numbers are connected to each other and what they mean, as this made me understand and see the solution a lot clearly, for example with number 2. I then chose an answer from my two options, and wrote a short explanation on why i chose my answer.

When it left the sun, and arrived back on Earth, how much time did it take?\n### Response :\nTo solve the above question, I came up with a few ideas that i thought would solve the question. First I thought that i could do it with hours, as this would be the easiest way, but unfortunately this option would give a wrong answer. Next, i thought of converting the problem into miles, the plane would do this by multiplying the miles by 25. However, multiplying 25 with 0 would result in an error, leaving it unanswered. I then tried converting it into minutes, by converting 1 hour into 60 minutes. By doing such, this meant that i would have 1260 minutes on earth, but 3,600 minutes on the sun. By adding this two together, i would then have 18 000 minutes. The next thing was converting it to seconds, but i then realized, if i started thinking like this, i could not finish this within an hour, however its possible to do. The most important thing that i realized was that i should stay away from the idea of minutes and hours, as this is what is most confusing to try to solve. So i thought of doing math, as this would most likely work. I did this by dividing 18,000 seconds by 60, what i found out is that the answer", "answer": " 106000"}

To solve for the number of bolts used, the number of bolts he used can be found by subtracting the left over quantities from the box counts. Since each box contains 11 bolts, he used 14 bolts, 7 boxes of nuts are left over. He used 15 nuts because each box had 15 nuts, so in total, he used 89 nuts. To solve for the remaining number of nuts and bolts, the following is followed:\nIf the amount of bolts used is equal to the amount of nuts used, the result is zero.\nIf it is not equal, then (total bolts \u2013 left over bolts) is subtracted from (total nuts \u2013 left over nuts) to get the result.\nSo 89 -7 = 82\n82- 6 = 76\nSo there are 76 nuts and 76 bolts left over.\n```\n\n### Input : In a town, the police report 50% of the crimes they solve end up with the offender found guilty, and 40% of the rest end with the offender found innocent.

Some researchers found that when people bike to work they are happier, but other researchers found that when they bike to work they feel worse.\n\nWe were doing some exploratory work on how happiness can depend on other variables, and we ran into some limitations.

The reason this makes sense is because in many work places it is more fun to exercise at work than to just work.\n\nHere is an excerpt from an article on the effectiveness of exercise at work:\n>\u201cIt justifies the effort and time that people put into physical activity,\u201d said Dr. LeBlanc. \u201cExercise at work can play an important role in helping you get through those hours and, hopefully, have a more fulfilled life and be more successful at work and at home.\u201d\n\nSince physical activity at work can positively influence your work output, commuting by bike makes sense as a positive change to your day. \n\nIn this study, it seems that biking has made commuting to work more fun, but other variables such as job satisfaction might be at play if biking to work makes commuting more enjoyable.  \n\n### Input \n\nSome people say that they do not like working out.

You are driving a bus with a stop at the intersection. The light turns green, and you take off. How many seconds will it take to finish the intersection if you have 30 seconds to finish it, the blue car has a red light, and you have a stop sign?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe blue car has a red and a green light, so that light cannot be interpreted just by what the light is indicating. We have to figure out if the car is going or stopping, and that takes some time.\n\n### Response : \n\nIt will take 14:59 seconds to take both cars. Blue car has a blinking green light, indicating they are trying to turn left. Buses cannot turn left while a car is making a left turn, so the blue light turns green in both directions, and turns red when the bus gets closer. The bus driver can see that car, and knows it will remain in that position unless it changes position, so he gets a little bit further until it has changed.\n\nThe average speed of the car and the bus will change as it stops, waiting for the light, because the car has to stop while the bus moves forward. The bus will end up being about 60 meters (189 feet) from the light. At 45.29 meters per second for a bus, 60 meters takes 15.37 seconds, then 35.29 from there.\n\nIt takes 12.75 seconds for the blue car to stop, and then 4.02 seconds for the car to travel from the light to the bus.\n\nThen it takes 0.20 seconds for the bus to change directions because the car has stopped.\n\nIt takes an additional 22.72 seconds to cross the intersection (the bus was already heading towards the right side so it doesn't have to maneuver).

Cat asks Can, \u201cWhat\u2019s a reasonable  price for Can\u2019s 50% interest in Kitty?  \u201d\n\n### Response 1:\u201cHow much  would Can  currently  sell  its 50%  interest  in Kitty for?  Let\u2019s call that,  value 1.  How much would Can  currently  get if it sold Cat  its 50-percent interest in Kitty for value 1?  Let\u2019s say that price is value 2.  So, value 2  must more than value 1 because, otherwise we could  have made money by selling Cat our 10% interest. So, we know that value 2 more than value 1.  And, value 1 is the going price for a 50% interest.  So, value more than value 1 or value 2 more than 1.5 times value 2 which is value more than value.\u201d\n\n### Response  2: \u201cWhat would an expert, a valuation expert, want to know first if Cat were asking for Kitty?  The size of Kitty. If you knew the size of Kitty, you could do two quick calculations:  Suppose you knew that Kitty\u2019s size is 10 times larger than Cat\u2019s. If Cat is able to sell it 50-percent  interest in Kitt for value 1050, what do you think Can\u2019s percent of Kitt is worth?  You can do the same calculation  if you know that Kitty\u2019 s size is 100 times larger than Cat. And, so, then, you  say to Can, well, your percent of Kitt is going to have value 12,500.\u201d\n\n### Inputs: How much less was this year\u2019s winter sports", "answer": " 333200"}

You used all of the sunscreen in your 2oz bottle on the first day of your beach trip.  When you ran out of the 2oz bottle, you began using the 5oz bottle, which you had left over from the first day.  How much did you spend on the two bottles?\n\n### The right answer was 52, but I chose a different answer, and I don't know why.\n\n### Response 2:\n\nBased on the context of the problem and wording of the question, one should use the 5oz bottles first, using 2oz bottles from that point on as you ran out of that size bottle initially.  It will take you 8 days to use the 5oz size bottle, and you'll have 1 left over.  You'll use about 2 days (3/4 ounce, rounded down, total) of the 2oz size bottle and 5 days worth of the 5oz size 2oz remainder.  You'll spend a total of \\$18.  The total amount you'll spend is \\$27 in the long run because you'll need to get another replacement, which will cost \\$9 of the extra amount you've collected at the beach.  The correct answer is that you'll spend a total amount of \\$36.\n\nAnswer: The solution I chose was one more than the right answer.  It looks like it was a typo in the initial question.  I thought the solution was correct based on the context of the wording/solution I came up with.  The reason I went ahead and chose the solution I created was because I thought it was too obvious that the 2oz bottles would be used up first.

He is out of pocket by $75. That would be the difference of 3000-3250 -300+70+255-70 = 75`\n\n### Solution:\nA: C B: D C: E\n\n### Solution\n`His total $3000 that's what he bought and what he returned that's $700 and 250 because he returned the tv which he bought worth 700 dollars. His total is 3700. His 80% 3700= 3000. Which should make about the only left 3000=2500 and then he makes up for any price left over so you subtract 700+$250=700=3700-2500 and make the rest up and the 700 makes up 3700-70=3250. Then add $500+$70=425 and the tv 255 and finally subtract 75 and he is left over by 75. His total is 255+70+500 +70 =$255 +70 = $3250`\n\n### Challenge\n`The only other choice i had to eliminate was A:S because 80% 75% and 90% all equalled $2500.

{"text": "416 hours\n\n### Rationale:\nSophia and Lucy both play on separate softball teams. Sophia was not the only child of Jerry the softball coach. That means that Sophia got to practice and play 8 games each during this seasons. And, Lucy got to play 8 games also, but the time did not add up to 8. Because it was 8 and 4 for each game, and that adds up to 12 games, each game it\u2019s own. Then, the practice and play add up to 4 hours for each game each, or it\u2019s just one game, but you need both in order to add one on top of the other, that\u2019s why it\u2019s not for each, it\u2019s for a total of each game with 4 hours each which sums up the the amount of time for Jerrys daughter, Lucy, played and practiced. Sophia, another daughter of Jerrys, played for 8, Lucy for 12, and for practicing for Lucy it was 20, (8 games \u00d74hours) + (12 games \u00d7 4hours) = 416", "answer": " 96"}

{"text": "It would be so sweet if we could have a solution to this problem, wouldnt it?\n\n### Instructions:Complete the following task.\nWrite a program that can add the integers in this program to the list. The program should start with the number 10 already added to the list, and every iteration, it should add the current value of i to the list, and the value of i to the 3-pointer of the next list element. Every element of the list must include the number it represents. Each element should be stored in separate memory.\n\nFor instance, if the program were to operate on an empty list, this program would create a list consisting of numbers 0 to 9.\n\nThe list elements should be stored in memory separated by the 3-pointers. Each number would have its own memory cell.\n\n### Input\n\nThe program starts with the number 1 to i, which represents the number of list elements, e.g. 1-9, 10-99 and 100+ are invalid. The program then subtracts the value of i from itself to determine the index of a new element to add. Finally, the program adds the value of i to new_element, which is now the new element, then assigns the 3-pointer to new element and stores it in 3-pointer_offset.\n\n### Response\n\nYour program should work by adding the element at address 1 and its successor.\n\n### Task 2:\n\nIn this task, you will create a method that can be passed to an array. The method should generate a random number, but the number must not be in the same memory cell as that for input_array. Use the list created in the solution to task 31 to solve this task. For example, for an input array of the numbers 2, 12, 107, 73, and 66, use a random number of between 1 and 3.\n\n### Run\n\nYour program should perform the following task:\n\n```c++\n    class Randomizer {\n        int  i;\n    public:\n        int index;\n        int length;\n        Randomizer(int index, int length) {\n            this->index = index;\n            this->length = length;\n        }\n    };\n\n    int", "answer": " 195"}

I could just brute force my way through it.  I could also use a while loop and increase the price by 1.25 each loop which would then give me the solution.  What I decided upon was finding the total cost of the robots first, which cost $62 (with a tax rate of 7.22%).  After that, I needed to add the tax amount and then add the tax amount back into the total robots cost which gave me the result at the top of my code block.  It took 25 minutes to write the function, but it solved the problem.\n\n#### Explanation:\n```js\nfunction taxRateInput () {\n    let taxRateinput;\n    while (taxRateinput = parseFloat(prompt(\u201cPlease enter a number that represents the tax rate.\u201d).toLowerCase().replace(/[^0-9.]/g, '').replace('.', '')));\n};\n```\nMy idea for figuring out how to do this was to use the parseFloat() and then have a string with a. character.", "answer": " 80"}

The question that needs answering is what John worked for 8 hours a day from the 3th to the 8th?  That information gives us two options, he worked 32 hours or he worked 24 hours.  Since we are  not just looking at the 3rd and the 8th, we now know that he worked a total of 8 hours on the 3rd and a total of 8 on the 8th.  \n  Since 8 + 8 = 16 we know he has a total of  44 (32 hours +16 hours) hours.\n  Since we divide 8 into his days he worked a total of  48 hours. In a case where he would have to work 81 hours for 5 days with a rest day in between, the rest day is excluded which gives us 80 hours worked.\n  Since 48 is less than 80 we know he worked 80 hours which is equivalent to 8 hours a day for 10 days.", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "### Solution:\nThis problem is very straight forward, you will have to solve for the 11,000th hour, and you can use the 9999 hour mark as a reference for the time.\n\nNow, you can assume all days are 24hrs long since you will be doing the math 365 days a year. So there, by the time Randy turned 12 yrs old, he had done 3,650(hours) days of practice, this is simple to subtract from the 10, 000, which leaves him 6,000hrs left or 600 days.\n\nNow we have to subtract 2 weeks of vacation, or 10 days of the 600 days left; the new equation is: 590 x (24days/day)= 15060\n\nTo get the answer in hours, you must divide your value in days by (24hrs/day), this will give you the answer in hours.\n\nIn short, all you have to do is divide your time (15,0060) and divide by the 2, in this instant case is 24hrs/days; in other words, the answer is 683hrs a day or 17hrs a day (9hours for 108 days).\n\n### Hints:\n1. Use the 999 hours mark as reference for the equation (x 10,060/x 999)\n2. Use the time mark for 1 day as reference (24 hr/day)\n\n## **\n\n**", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "In order to do this question you should first count the number of years between each and after determining the number you should then subtract each number from 50, this would give you your answer of 50 - number.\n\n### Input\nThe first thing we should do to this problem is we should get a list of items and order them, and we should start at the first item in the list and start counting. Next, we should use the list to find out which two items we crossed out and which two were the last items we crossed out.\n\n### Response\nYou should start the problem by counting the number or items as the total and next number as the largest number after the total.  After calculating these two numbers the program should then calculate what the sum of the original list after removing the first two items should be.\n\n### Demo:\nLet's say we have a 5 item task list, so the total number of items is $5$$. The largest number in the list after the total is $3$$. These two numbers are input values into a loop, because let's say we want to start at the $2$nd item we would need to subtract $3$ from $3$ and we would obtain $0$ as a result, and we would also subtract $3$ from the $1$st item and the result will be $9$ because the $1$st and $2$nd items are the two items that we're subtracting.\n\n### If the loop has gone through both input values then we have reached the end of the task list, however if we have not reached the end then if the loop goes through the same input values then we should try inputting $1$ more time.\n\n### When we have done this process, we would just need to divide the total number by the largest number left after removing the first two inputs, to get the answer.\n\n### Ex.\n$$ \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\hline 3&4&9\\\\ 0&3&7\\\\ 9&7&6\\\\ 6&6&4\\\\ 4&4&2\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} $$", "answer": " 8"}

If this is the same as having one more 180-mile trip than a round-trip from one city to another, which of the following cities (city names listed in random order) could be travelled to by car (A: Des Moines B: Tulsa C: Ames D: Omaha E: Lincoln)?\n### Response: The family was travelling by car. They went the distance of 484 miles and this means they would have drove approximately 180 miles. The extra mileage is only a few miles per trip over the distance traveled by car so if we were to travel to the 180 mile distance and not return, that would be a trip to Des Moines because it is the nearest distance that fits within the family's mileage.

{"text": "Jim has 4x as many Buicks as the amount of Fords that Jim has.  So if Jim has 301 total, Jim has 300 models total Buicks.  Jim has 3 more models total than Buicks than Fords than Chevrys that Jim has, so if we call these three extra models models A, B, and C, then if Jim has 3x as many models total C as he has B.  We can find Chevys that Jim has and substract it from 4x to see the amount of B Jim has, then divide that by 3 to find models A.  We are now ready to subtract models A from 4x to find the amount of C Jim has.  We need to add C plus A to Fords, then divide that number by 4 for the amount of Buicks Jim has.  We have no idea how many models total Jim has, so for example let's pretend that Jim has 30 models total, then we will figure it out by counting the amount of Buick models he has if he has a total of 30.  301-30= 271 so if Jim has a total of 271 models, then Jim has 4x the number of Buicks that Jim has, or 112 Buicks.\n\n### Inputs:If one is given 30 pieces of fabric, each piece being 2 meters by 6 meters, and one adds 6 + 2 to that value and the result is 334, what is the volume of fabric? \n\n### Demostration:Input the following numbers and see the output:\n-252 x 183\n-252\n467545.71875\n\n### Response to Input 1: 10\n\n### Response Input 2: 236.35 cubic meters.\n\n### Response 2:\nWe are given 30 pieces that total up to 30 x 12 = 360 and we multiply this number by 2 and subtract 30 and add this to the number 4, therefore the given value of 30 is added to the number we found out about 29 and the result is 4.", "answer": " 220"}

{"text": "The final number of seagulls.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nInput- There are 36 seigulls. Kids scare away 1/4 of the seagulls by throwing stones. 1/3 of remaining birds decide to fly away to McDonalds. How many birds are left?\n\nExplanation- We can represent this problem as a tree. We start with 36 seagillls. After we scare away 14 seagulls, we now have 22 remaining seagulls on a level above the 14 stones. We will need to split them again so they all share the same level at the end. The 12 seagulls are split equally. In order to represent this split, one way is to write 12 seagills as 7 above the stones and 5 below the stones. After this we have 20 seagulls total. After we have 16 seagulls after throwing the stones, we have 3 (12) + 14 (7); 16 remaining. After throwing stones, we have equal number of seagull numbers and the last time we split was at level 3 above the stones. We are left with 4 seagilles to place at this particular split. We then count one, two, three and we have 36; 4 remaining seagulls. \n\n### Input:\"I'm going to play chess with my nephew.

It goes against the moral and ethical right of being treated at any workplace fairly and equally, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexuality. Discrimination is found in various contexts and settings including the places where food is served, housing and where people shop.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nTo understand discrimination you must know there is a legal definition of discrimination and to apply it where appropriate. If anyone is experiencing discrimination and wants to raise a complaint, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and other legal bodies may be of assistance for victims of discrimination to receive support and justice in their case.\n\n### Actions\n\nThe first step is to be able to identify any form of discrimination you may be a victim to. This is known as indirect discrimination, which has unfair treatment and has an adverse impact. It happens when a person has been excluded by a policy or procedure. Next you would have to know about what constitutes as indirect discrimination. When dealing with this type of discrimination there are many examples of what is considered as indirect discrimination when applying to employment. These include: a rule that employees must all wear a particular type of uniform, or that only men can be promoted to be a manager. Discrimination can", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "### Solution:If we take the 22 beakers and we know that there are 8 of them with copper ions then the rest has to be beakers without copper ion so 14 beakers have copper ion. After testing 14 times the solution has 14 beakers with copper ion so out of five we can assume that we have 3 beakers without coper ion. If we add the solution that has coper ion we have 8 beakers with it and then we must solve the equation to achieve 3 beakers that have no copper ion.\n\nSo first we need 8 from 14 and we solve this equation using 14-3=11. \nSo 14-3*11=16 \nSo 16 - 8 = 8 \nSo we have a total of 8 beakers with coper ion and 3 beakers without.\n\n### Bonus\n\n### Bonuses:\n\nBonus 1:The price of coffee at a local coffee shop has been going up. After selling one more cup of coffee at the new price, the revenue increases by an unknown amount. If a cup of coffee is sold for 3.45 each morning, how much should it be sold for each morning to earn at least 125?\n\n**Solution:**\nWhen the new price is going up the revenue also goes up so the new revenue is at least the revenue that was before so: 3.45 * 125 = revenue. Then subtract the revenue from the amount of cups sold which is 3.45 because if I sold 125 cups I would be making 125/125 * 3.45 and the answer would be 125 dollars in my revenue at least if the new price is at 3.45.\n\nBonus2:\n\nWhen there are 42 pieces of food we need half of the pieces to be green.

{"text": "Bran needs $150 to pay his tuition 3 months.\n\n### Inputs:Gabriel is walking on the road when he sees a house. He enters the house to ask for directions. He passes by the living room, kitchen and bathroom. As he leaves, he sees a door which was not visible before. What room is Gabriel in?\n\n### Demo:\nThis problem is too much of a red herring. Since there's only one room and Gabriel had already exited the house, he's definitely in the living room. It doesn't matter what other things he had done inside the house. This answer is based on a misunderstanding that it's enough that he entered the house.\n\n### Original:Gabriel is talking with Rita at 9:14PM while Rita's clock just read 10:11PM. How long was Gabriel at Rita's?\n\n### Ridiculous answer: Gabriel had already left Rita's house when her clock struck 10:10PM. That means Gabriel was at Rita's for only 26 minutes.\n\n### Correct answer: Gabriel had already been talking to Rita for 49 minutes when her clock struck 9:15PM.\n\n### Rationale:\nThis problem looks weird because it makes the assumption that one of the two clocks is at least 11 minutes slow. It would be like thinking that Rita had stayed up that entire time in the middle of the night. This problem is asking how long Gabriel was actually talking to Rita, which we can see is a bit greater than 26 minutes. The answer can then be calculated by finding the difference between the actual time and the clock time at when Gabriel left Rita.\n\n### Reference:https://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/6-brain-teaser-logic-puzzles-to-make-your-fri\n\n\n### Input : The sum of the positive even numbers below 100 is 416.\n\n### Answer : The negative even number (-2) will not be added to any number below 100.\n\n### Correct Answer :\n\n### Input :- \nThe negative even number (-2).\n\n### Demo:-\nIn the question the", "answer": " 18"}

The Ford only has 38 gallons of gas and the BMW has two and half times the Ford's supply. The first car to run out of gas is going to be their first car because it can only do 15 MPH.

Buying the hand truck would cost more than both the rental and the screwdriver and using the screwdriver would be cheaper than both. The power screwdriver would cost the least at $10 and is able to hold 4 screws before a charge on the battery of the screwdriver is to be used. The chainsaw costs $100 and can cut a tree that cost $50 to a half an inch in length. If buying, a saw would cost more than both renting and using the power screwdriver combined and the screwdriver would cost more than the power saw and the hand truck.

{"text": "40\nInput: What day does a leap year have an extra day? Choices:  Sunday Tuesday Thursday Friday\nRationales: This is a logic question trying to determine the leap year.\nAll leap years contain 52 weeks, have only 5 non-leap days and contain a total of 366 days.\nThese facts allow us to eliminate answers B and C because there are only 366 days in a leap year.\nIf a year is a leap year, the first Thursday will fall during the month of March. The first Tuesday will fall during the months of March, June, September, and December. So, since Tuesday is always 2 days after Monday, this means that the 3 months above are 6 months apart.\nThus, the only leap day is February 29 because when leap day occurs, February will only have 28 days and March will only have 31 days.\nThus, if Feb 29 is a Friday, it means Feb 28 is a weekend, and, since the first Thursday of a year is in March, Feb 27 must be a Sunday and since Wednesday falls in April, Feb 29 must be a Friday. Thus, the first Thursdays of each year all fall in the year of a leap year. Since the year starts with a leap day in Feb, the total number of days in the first 6 days of each year when the first Thursday is in April is 4. We have found 3 of these in 2012 and 2016, therefore, the days after February in each of these years falls on a leap year\nTherefore, the last leap year with Feb 29 being in the same month as the first Thursday on the fourth day being a Tuesday, or the first leap day, in a leap year is 2000. (See Wikipedia Leap Year Algorithm)\n\nRationales: The answer must be year 2000 because the first three years which  occur in the month of April are the first three leap years of the millennium: 2000,2004, 2008.

Options A and B do not make sense because if Jeff skipped more times in the previous rounds, it does not change the number of skips Jeff does in the last round if it is the average. Option C would be an issue, because Jeff did not complete \"double\" the amount of skips Sam did in the first round. The final result of the competition would have to be more than Sam but not double. Option D is unneccesary and does not answer the question. The question is asking to estimate how many skipping Jeff did in each round, option E fits the context in that it gives an estimate.\n\n### Answer:  There is a lot of information in this question that is not given but must be assumed for this question.  Therefore we will start with Jeff doing 9 more skips per round.  The question has to be written out in words to solve the problem properly.\n![Write out Question.png](Write out Question.png)\n1. I. Round 1: 1 more skip per round than Sam equals 16.  Therefore Jeff skipped 15 in round 1\n2. II. Round 2: Jeff skipped 3 less times than Sam times 15 = 45\n3. III. Round 3: Jeff skipped 4 less times than Sam times16 = 68\n4. IV. Jeff got tired and completes half the number of skipped than Sam.  We can use round 4 as the example. Round 4 he would have skipped 16 and Sam would have skipped 28. The competition would only have 24 rounds left in the entire competition. Half of 24 is 12 rounds.

This resulted in him having lost on the final price by $4000, or 1300. Therefore, his last out of pocket is $2000-1300 which result in $700.\n\nAnswer: C: $4, 000\n\n### Instructions: 1. What type of car did James buy? Choices: 2. What was the sticker price of the car? 3. Did the final out-of-pocket price exceed the discount price?\nRationales:  1. The first question refers to the car James bought.\nIt can be deduced that James bought a $3000 sticker value.\nThe car came from two sources: buying the original $3000 car and getting a $10000 discount.\nWe can answer the first question by simply subtracting 2 from 1.\nIt is stated that we need to buy a sticker price 90% of what the original is, which means, he bought $90,000 for 30000 which leaves us with $60000.\nThe last result from this is $30,070-$2007=$32,070. From this equation, you can determine the answer to this question is B.\n\n2. The second question refers to the sticker price of car sold by James: the sale price of  the car. This can be inferred from the question by adding the discount price to the sticker price. The sale price $2000+$16000=$36000. This gives us the $", "answer": " 11000"}
{"text": "The tree grew from its height in 2017 to 120 meters at the end of 8 years.\n\n### Rationales:What is given in the question?\n\nFrom the question it is given that the tree, at a specific time in the past 2017 grows to have 10% more height than its previous year which means that its height will grow by 10%.\n\n### How do we know that the tree grew by 10% \n\nFrom the question given it is clearly given that the tree will grow by 1 year. This means that its height after 2017 will be 110% of it height in the previous year.\n\n### Why does the tree grow to be10% greater than the previous year \n\nFrom 8 years to 9 years the tree will grow by an extra year and that will mean that the tree will grow. From year 8 to 9 the tree will grow by one extra year and by the end of 9 years the tree would have reached the extra height by 1.1 multiplied by 100.\n\n### What is the height of the tree at the end of year 1?\n\nThe height of the tree at 1 year is  100% of its height, this means it is 110% +10% = 120% of what it was it height previously which means that its height is 10% more.\nHence the height of the tree in year 1 is 120%.\n\n## Response:If I had to describe how to write the best essay it would involve brainstorming, reading the essay question, and then making a plan.\n\n## Rationales:\nFirst I would want to create some ideas about what the question can be about. \n\n### What brainstorming involves\n\nIn my opinion brainstorming involves the thinker to create ideas according to the problem given.\n\n### How to read an essay question\n\nAfter having come up with several ideas I will then start reading the essay question in an attempt to have answers to the same by the end.\n\n### A response regarding writing the best essay\n\nAfter having read the essay, I will now have an idea of the best response to the given", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "The sunflowers from Packets A and B each had a different percentage difference to the same height compared to the whole packet, for example, an 80% increase in the height of the sunflower compared to the same difference in height in the whole packet.\nThe total amount of whole packets in the field that we're growing can be seen with the following calculation. Packet A has 35 sunflowers with a total of 656 inches and Packet B has 25 sunflowers with 496 inches.\n\nThen, this means Packet B had 429 fewer inches than Packet A.\nWe can determine this using the equation with the given heights.\n\nSubtracting the whole total inches of packet A with the whole total inches of Packet B we can determine the difference in total inches, we can simplify this by using a fraction:\n\n```\n= 656 - 496\n= 160\n```\n\nThen we can make 160 into a fraction using the following equation:\n\n```\n160 / 192\n= 3 / 5\n```\n\nSo, the height of the sunfower in Packet B is 3 / 5 of the height of the sunflour of Packet A.\n\nThis can also be seen by multiplying the proportion of the height with the given height in inches for each packet:\n\n```\n(160 / 496) * 192\n```\n\nMultiplying makes a difference between multiplication and division.\n\n= 192 * 3\n\nGiving us the result that sunflowers from Pack B are 3/5 (1.6) of the height of the whole packets.\n\nThe sunflower from Packet A was 20% tighter, so we know that the height difference is 1 / 2 of that and we know the total pack height from 80%:\n\n```\n20% of 20% is 4%\n4% of 200 is 8\n8% of 192 is 16\n```\n\nTherefore the height difference in the packet is 16.

There are 24 hours in a day, and a day has 60 minutes. \n\nWe now can divide the number of minutes by 60 to find the number of hours in a day.\n\nThis means that we have to divide 5 days by 20 episodes per 24 hours in each day to figure out how many hours per day he has to watch episodes.\n\nWe can use this formula to find out how many hours he watches per day: (5 \u00f7 24) \u2217 20 = 12.5.\n\nOutput:John watches for an average of 12.5 hours per day.\n\nNow we can input the answer from the previous step into the last step to complete the task.\n\nInput and Output: The final step now is to calculate John's daily watch hours.

At this speed, it would take the same amount of time to go 700 m as it would to travel 550 m.  Which number of miles is greater?\n### Response D\n\n### Rationales\n1. One could argue that 700 m would require more time for the car to travel since the same amount of time at 130 m/h results in shorter distance traveled.\n2. However, this reasoning would be incorrect, because the reason for the two distances being equal is because the car drove past the first distance faster than the  additional distance.\n3. Since the additional distance was not entirely traveled, the car didn't need extra time to get to the additional distance.\n4. Therefore, the faster the car traveled, the sooner it would come closer to the end of the journey.\n5. Choice A (1 mile) has a value greater than the total distance it had to travel, and is therefore incorrect.\n6. Choice B (550 m) is more than twice the distance it had to travel and therefore, is incorrect.\n7.

This should be split by the three people to give Ela 3 pounds of firewood.\n### Comment:\nYou are correct in realizing that Kimberley collects `10` pounds of firewood, so the total amount of firewood is `12 + 10 + 14 = 36`. The final question is to determine how much firewood Ela collects. There are `2` remaining pounds of firewood after Kimberley and Houston's collection; therefore, Ela must collect 2 of these `2` pounds.\n### Question:Why not just Ella collects 3 pounds of fire?\n### Answer:Agreed. This is a much simpler way of saying it. Great job!\n\n### Repeat Input to Answer: Kimberley collect 10 pounds of wood, Houston collect 12 pounds of wood, and Ela collect 2 pounds of wood. What is Ela's total amount of wood?\n\n### Dem. Response: Ela collect 3 whole pounds of wood.\n### Comment and Reaction:\nNice work with this question, but there are two minor misconceptions that you need to be aware of. First, you were counting `half` a pound as one `pound`. All we know is that `everyone` has collected `3.75` pounds of wood and that Kimberley has collected `10` pounds. This leaves `2.25` pounds for Ela. You have already determined that this `2.25 pounds` are distributed evenly among the three. Therefore, Ela has collected `2.25 / 3 = 0.75 pounds`. The question doesn't ask what she has, but instead how much she has collected. She has collected `0.75 pounds` of wood.\n\nSecondly, you are not showing your work. If you add the `3 + 2.25` and subtract `5.25,` you should get `7.75.` There's no need to add the `3 +2.25.` Remember, we are taking the `3.75 minus the", "answer": " 13"}

This would mean that he didn't sell the desired amount of chickens since he couldn't maintain his business as well as profit. He should work harder and plan how he can sell more chickens.

The idea of representative democracy means that people elect other people with the idea that they will represent the people while in office.\n\nThis is a democracy. There is a voting process. There are people running for elected office and citizens can vote for people they like.\n\nThe United States of America is a representative democracy, but an indirect one. The citizens vote for other people who make decisions on our behalf at the political level.\n\nDemocracy and Dictatorship-\nIn democracy, a country does not just depend on its leader or president. Voting also means that if a people does not want a leader anymore, they have the right to vote, as long as they are qualified citizens; and if that leader or president is voted in and is not a good leader, their votes will have an impact on him or her. On the other hand, this is in dictators, where the people don't have choices, and there's really no vote. This country doesn't belong to everyone, but just a few, and there are always many people that are suffering and trying to get there.\n\nTakes responsibility,", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "Input:In ten years, how many years will my brother be older than myself? Answer: B: 47 Years\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question gives the year of birth of the older brother and the current age of the older brother.\n2. It then also provides the value of 'T'. \n3. From the details given, we can eliminate one of the options - C.\n4. The given information suggests that 'A' and 'B' are the two possible years of the difference in ages of the two brothers.\n5. When we plug 'T' into the expression, A+ (10 * T), we find that A + 100 is the only number which fits the expression. Hence, 'A' will be one of those two choices - A or B, which is 51 or 49 years, respectively. \n6. We will not know whether my brother is older or younger. So we choose the option which will make the future age of the elder sibling higher by the difference of just one year from my own.\n7. That is why, from the available options, B will be the correct answer since 'B' gives the highest value for 'Sum of our ages' after ten years. (ie: 'B' = 50(T) + 60 = 47(T) + 100).\n8. The answer will be obtained by deducting the difference of age between my brother and myself now (ie: 17 years). So, the answer will be B-17, which is 29 or 30.\n### Answer:\nInput:In 10 years, I'll have been working in the industry for (x) years. \nHow much older than I will my boss be? Choices:  Options A, B, C, D: Choice A: 8 Choice B: 16 Choice C: 5 Choice D: 6  \nRationales: For a direct comparison, we will set x to 8 when we know that the sum of their ages will be 57, the difference being the number of years the boss will be older.\nFor x to be 8, we find that the sum of their age = x + 7 and their difference = 29.

Choices:  The answer is found  B: The answer is on the second C: The answer is on last line D: The answer is on line 68E: The answer is on top line\nRationales:1.The question asks about the rule for subtracting three-digit numbers and then keeping the answer in two digits.\n2. The \"rule\" refers to a particular method, or set of steps, for performing a task. One possible rule that could be used to subtract three-digit numbers and keep the result in two-digit form would be long division.\n3. In most forms of long division, you subtract the digits located in the ones column of the divisor from the ones column of the dividend, then subtract the digits located in second column of the divisor, then you subtract from the tens column, and then you subtract the last column from the hundreds column.\n4. This process would allow you to always obtain the answer in a two-digit number for the remainder left from the long division process. This is the rule given in Option B: The answer is found in the second line.\n5. Since the question states that you can always perform this process to obtain a two-digit number as the answer, Option B is correct. \nAnswer: B: The answer is in the second line\n\nInput: Choose all the even numbers you can find in 505 using the following rule.

Thus, Alex would never have any money left.\nAlthough the amount of water he must pay for is given, along with the amount he must give to charity, the amount of his regular salary is not. \n\nOption B does not work out. If he is earning $500 a month and taxes are 10%, then tax for a single week is $55.

Some details I missed when answering this question included:\n\n### Rationale 1:\n\nA: When I first read this question, I thought it was asking, \"If Clover goes for 1.5-miles in the morning and another in the evening, how many miles does she walk in 30-days?\" Instead, I focused on the fact that Clover goes for a walk in the morning and then again in the evening. This lead me to overlook the fact that the question isn't actually asking about what Clover does, but what she walks.\n\n### Rationales 2:\n\n#### Rationale(B):\n\nI initially overlooked the fact that in order for Clover to walk 2.5 miles per day in a month, he must walk 30 days straight without a break in order to accumulate 6.5 miles, which would end up equaling 2.5 for the day.\n\n#### Rationale (E):\n\n\nWhen looking at the math I used it was calculated that Clover walks about 6 miles in a month when multiplying the two daily mile walks together. However, Clover walking for 30 days is incorrect and would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n### Recommendation\n1. To do this question specifically I had to think about what we know about Clover. We know that Clover walks for 1.5 miles in the morning and evening everyday. This is what we are working with and must be applied in the question.\n2. We don't know how Clover feels about walking.

A 3-pound bag of coffee beans costs $6.80 and contains 2 1/3 pounds. 1/2 a regular gallon of milk costs about $1.96. She doesn't need to buy another gallon of milk because she is replacing it anyway because she is going to drink 4 fewer cups of regular \"regular\" milk so her regular cost was replaced by the cost of 2 2/3 1/2 regular gallons of milk. \n\nSo, by replacing the 3 pounds of coffee she is still buying 3 pounds and she needs to make 2.8 pound of it.

The program should also determine the median value.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: A) 0 A) 1 B) 10 B) 2 C) 7\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe input consists of two parameters (inputs), each defined by six parameters. Each input consists of seven parameters (numbers to be checked as the highest and lowest values), while each parameter consists of six numbers to be checked as the lowest (median) values.\n\nConsidering input A, we have a total of two inputs.\n\nFor the first input on the left, the highest number (10) does not exist in the number of inputs (6 numbers, between 0 and 6).\n\nWe can say, however, that number 1 does exist with a corresponding lowest number or the median.\n\nLikewise, the lowest number does not exist in the input (6 numbers, between zero and 10).\n\nWe can confirm, however, that the highest number does exist with a corresponding minimum or the median.\nThe highest number, which is 10, is higher than the lowest number and closest to the middle, which is 9. Thus, the lowest number would fall somewhere between 2 and 8.\nAs the lowest number is the closest to the middle, we will call it 7.\n\nFor the second input on the right, the highest number (7) does not exist in our number base (between 0 and 6, total = 12).\n\nWe can, however, confirm that the lowest number does exist on our number base (between zero and 10, total = 16).\n\nThe lowest number, which is 7, is lower than the highest number in our number base.\nIt is closest to the middle, and therefore should fall somewhere between 20 and 16.\n\nSo, the number 11 is the closest number to our initial lowest number, which is between 20 and the higher number in the base (total = 16). Since we said our lowest number is 7, we will", "answer": " 80"}

In 2004 there were 1.2 persons per household, where households now have 3 persons. What's the change in persons per household?\n\n### Demand:A family is a household and has at least two people. Each person has at least half a person. One person in 2003 has three people, one person in 204 has one person. Two people in 2043 have 4 people. This gives them a population of 2.066.

Then what's the ratio of grapes to apples?\n\n### Answer: 1:9\n\n### Method:Ratio \n\n### Detailed Solution: Ratios are the best part of this question. \n\nRation 1\n(Ideally, the 1000 stands as your \"base\" that makes up all of the other ratios with the apples. With 1000, we know that the total of our grapes is 1. Also, since we know the total of 1000 for the apples we need to find out how much the grapes outnumber them. \n\nWe can easily do this knowing that we have 4.5kg grapes for the 100kg of appels.( 4.5kg x \"total 1000\"  =  (3.5 + 4.5) kg \n\nMultiplicating 1000 gives us 3.5(kg) x 1000 which equals 3500.(1000  x 3500 = 3500) We then subtract 3500 with 3500 and will end up with -500.

{"text": "The question requires determining the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel. It seems that Rick chose to give the number of cards that are equal to the number of friends he saw, and to his sisters each of whom he decided to give the same number of cards, while only keeping a part of the cards to his own. Based on that we can answer by logic reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the 15 cards kept by Rick would be equivalent to all friends seen divided by 15 + 15/2, where '15/2' implies that Rick decided to give 15 cards divided by 2 to each of the sisters. Since Rick saw 8 friends, thus 8*15 = 120 cards will be consumed to give the cards to 8 friends. Since all the cards are distributed equally to 2 sisters, and they will get same amount of cards we assume that 60 cards will be divided to be given to both sisters. Now Rick saw 8 friends and he decided to give them 9 cards each, which will be equivalent to dividing 120 by 9, and if we assume similar method of distribution to be given to sisters, we can come to an assumption that 24 cards could be divided to be given out to both sisters, which will give the remaining cards, and this way we will have 24+15+60+24 =123 cards will remain and if Rick decides to give all these cards to Miguel, it is only feasible if Miguel only takes 9 cards, the same number as that given to friends. Then what is leftover of 24 is what Miguel receives.\n\nNow, to answer this:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac {56}{7} \\right) - \\left( \\frac { 8*9 }{14*7} \\right) + 64\n$$\nWhich can be rearranged as,\n$$\n64 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac {37}{7} - \\frac{12*3 }{28*7} )\n$$\nor using the distributive property on the subtraction\n${37} + ( \\frac {12*3 }{{\\frac {28}{7 }  - {\\frac {12*9}{", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "The answer to this question is 60 pages.\n\n### Explanation:\nTo find the answer, we must determine the number of pages left to read. Let x be the number of pages of the book that Julie has to read. We are given that Julie has currently read 12 pages. Let y be the starting number of pages to be read. Then, we have 12 + 2y = 120. We know that Julie wants to read half the remaining pages. And in mathematics, we can represent the remaining pages as x-y. So let x=x-y. Multiply both sides by 2 and we get 2x = y x 2. Finally, we subtract y from both sides and get x = y/2. \nSo if Julie wants to read the 50 remaining pages, then to determine the number of pages to read tomorrow, we can substitute x = 50.

The result is then sorted by \"Weight\" so that the highest weighted intent is the top priority intent and all remaining words will be assigned to the top priority intent. If that intent is saturated then the rest of the input words are given their own unique intent with the \"Weight\" set to the sum for the weight of the previously assigned words.\n\nThe \"intent mapping list\" is then compared to an intent dictionary created from a file containing all possible \"intent_name_to_id\" mapping where \"intent_name\" is a word describing an intent such as \"gradeMath\"(this will use the \"gradeMath\" intents) and \"dict\" is a dictionary containing the \"intent_name\" to \"intent_id\" pairs.\n\nThe comparison will return the intent_id so the previous intention with the top priority is updated by changing the \"intent_id\" attribute and the \"Weight\" is incremented by one. Any \"intent_name\" in the input string is added to the intent dictionary and \"Weight\" is increment for each \"intent_name\". If the \"Weight\" is greater than the current weight of the top priority intent then that intent is the top priority and the new words will be added to the top priority intent otherwise those words will be added to a new intent with weight of \"Weight\" to prevent words from being assigned indefinitely to the same intent.", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "The correct answer is 205, with a confidence of 70%.\n\n### Detailed reasoning:In the weekday (Monday through Friday) question, the first two subtopics are about the percentage difference (25% - (2/5) - 10/5) = 150/100%. Next, the questions of Thursday and Friday are about the number of cars passing (10 each = 20). Lastly, the questions of Saturday and Sunday are about the difference between passing the street and passing by it (5 - 10 = - 5 cars).\n\n### In the first three weekdays, the difference between percentage difference is a negative number of 25%. The difference between Monday, percentage difference is a negative 50%. The first two subtopics (Monday through Thursday) represent the number of cars, and the final two subtopics (Thursday - 20 and Friday - 10) represent their difference of 10 each (that is, 10 added up to = 20).\n\n### To summarize, we can say that the subtopics Monday through to Thursday represents a total percentage difference of - 350/10%, and the subtopics of Friday and Saturday represents 2 cars each or a total of 4. The questions of Monday through Thursday are about the number of difference (150% - the difference of - 3.5 = 150% + 15), while the questions of Friday 10 cars on the street and Saturday is 20. That would be a total of 10 cars between them; the remaining 5 cars would be on Sunday. As a result, 150% - 15 = 135%. In the first three subtopics (M - Th), we have a total of 25 cars. This means that 230% - 5 = 225 cars in the first three subtopic. Therefore, the total number of cars, Monday through Sunday is 225 + 10 (235) = 245; however, if we round it up to 3 decimal places, then we get 245.3.

Therefore, Bob will spend 3 dollars to buy 1 drink.\nSince Andy spent 1 dollars to get 1 hamburger, and Bobby spent 3 dollars to buy two sandwichs, Andy has spent 4 dollars to buy one hamburger and Bobby has spent two 3 dollars to buy a drink.\nBob's drink cost = 4 - 2- 3 = 3 dollars.\n\n### Question:\nThis was an instruction that described a task and asked you to write an appropriate response.

They live in forests, but in the human world, they are kept as pets. A lot can be said about monkeys and their similarities with chimpanzees. An example of a similar trait is that chimpanzees and monkeys are covered in hair. Chimpanzees and monkey have the same characteristic of long tails which is used in maintaining balance when walking or running. \nMonkeys and chimps use their long tails to hang from branches. This helps them rest and relax. A distinguishing characteristic between monkeys and chimpanzees is that monkeys have tails that reach from their bottom to their buttocks, while chimpanzees have very long tails that fall down their legs. \nMonkeys are found in the African forests, chimpanzees on the other hand are from Congo and Angola, while they are both primates, monkeys are considered superior to chimpanzees according", "answer": " 45"}

It's 1kg plus 0.5kg (0.5kg is 1/2) or 1.5kg. So there are 4 hours left, it means there are 4x1.5kg=6kg of flour. There are 6kg over 1kg meaning that the remainder is 2kg which is 2x1kg=2kg. There are 2kg plus 6x1kg=6kg, in total it is 8kg. After the calculation, it can be seen that there are 8kg over 0.5 which is 16kg. It means there is 16x0.5 which is  8kg of flour.

{"text": "### Demnstration:\nThe answer to this question lies in an equation:\n$$[TotalFlags * TotalFriends] = TotalCost$$\n\nSince they want one flag for everyone, we know they want $5 for 55 flags.  Since they have a total of $10.00, they would need to buy 20 flags at $5.00 to cover everyone.  However, they only have $10.0 You would have to purchase the remaining flags after the $1.00 discount by spending $1.00 times the difference in total flags.  Since there are an additional $5.00 worth of flags that need to be bought, the total cost is $6.50.\n\nThe answer of $2.50 for 10 flags should be listed as incorrect.  The answer is correct, because 0.5 flags at a cost of $5.00 would be 50 cents per flag.  This is incorrect, because the question states that $2.50 equals 10 flags.", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "It takes Tony 4 minutes to assemble a Widget. \n\n### Explanation: The Question mentions that Sam can assemble 1 widget in 10 minutes and Jack can help assemble 2 widgets in 15 minutes. \n\nThe amount of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack in 10 minutes is 1. Because they help each other, they can assemble 2 widgets each in the next fifteen minutes. It was Tony who finished the entire job. Therefore, it means he finished about 76/4 widgets in an hour. This means he can complete 66/4 widgets an hour. So Tony can assemble 41 widgets in an hour i.e. 41/60. This is the same as 4/6. Because Jack was able to work for 4 hours, it means he can complete 4 x 41 widgets an hour. This translates to 164. This translates to around 45 widgets in an hour, hence Tony's speed of 4 minutes.\n\n### Input When Sammy and his cousin Diane ate a cheeseburger, they had the same calories.

To get the calorie, let  = Calories in Cheeseburger;  = Calories in Chicken; =>  = 2*;     \nTo get number of Cheeseburger, let  = calories in Cheeseburgers;  = calories in Chicken;   =>  = 2;     \nSince they are the same, they can have the same amount of caloric need. Let  = caloric need in cheeseburgers; = caloric need chicken =>  = 2x  \nTherefore,  = 2 \u00d7 2 which is 4. So, one cheeseburger has 4 calories", "answer": " 30"}

The quotient is 0. What is the remainder of this division?\n### Demonstoration:\nInput: Dividend=10 Remainder=6\n\nRationales:\n1. It is safe to assume that the remainder is after the 1 digit number. Therefore, 6 is after the quotient(answer) and the 1 digit number will be before the quotient. The quotient does not matter because the remainder is the only one that we are interested in. If we do the division, we will get\n\n10/6 = 1 remainder 6. \n\n2. This tells us the divisor is smaller than the dividend.\n\n3. A 2-digit dividend divided by a 1 digit divisor will produce a quotient and a remainder\n\n4. 10/6=1 remainder 6.\n\n5. If the remainder is 6 then the 2-digit number needs to have the remainder on the ten's digit (6 in this case).\n\n6. A 2 digit number always has a ten's digit which makes sure when we subtract the divisor from the dividend(10 -6=4) that the 1 will have a quotient of 4. \n\n7.

The other grandchildren each have `(n/2)` grandchildren.\n\nCombining these, we get `3 \u00d7(n/2) \u20139 +n(n\u22121)/ 4\u22122\u00d7(n\u22122) = (n)(n\u22121)/ 2\u22129` grandchildren.\n\nThis simplifies to `(n\u22121)2.`\n\nSubstituting each value of n, we get our final answer: n=16\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade 8 math question.\n\n**Input:**\n```txt\nWhat is the number of letters between A and H?\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```txt \nThe number of letters between AH = 10\n```\n\n**Reasoning and rationale**\n\nLet's look at all the letter between the first letter and the last.\n\n**Input**\n```txt\nC B A D E F G H \n```\n\nWhen we group them by 2, we get:\n```txt\nA C D E F G H   \n```\n\nand there are 8.\n\nNow we look at each individually:\n* `A` is 1 from `A`\n* `C` is 2 from `A`\n...\n* `H` is 10 from `AH`\n\nand each have a value 1,2,3,4......10, and the total we get is `1+2+3+4+....10 = 2 + (2\u00d710) = 20`\n\n**Input**:\n```txt\nWhat was the total number of letters between A B and H?\n```    \n\n**Reason**: `20`\n\n### Input\n```txt", "answer": " 58"}

If possible, describe your strategy for solving the question.\nOutput: The number of options to choose from is limited and each has a different approach.  The method chosen should be explained and demonstrate how it reduces the options or the amount of time needed to figure out the solution.\n\n### Input/Output: \n\nAnswer: C(20):\nThe 20 represents:\n\n* the initial weight when it was a puppy \"p\"=6, the number of puppies in the beginning\n* the final adult weight of the dog, \"a\"= 120\n* the number of \"doublings\" is 17, d\n\nAs shown, the 20 represents the number of combinations in the dog's growth. The C() operator tells you that the answer can be found using combinations.\n\nFrom the question, you can tell that it is doubling each time. Therefore, each \"doubling\" has a \"2\" as its index, which is used by the (2) operator. 6 is index of puppy is the first round of growth and there are two other rounds of growth with a starting weight of 12\n\nWith the dog's growth, it follows the rules for calculating C(x). It looks at each round of growth and the starting weight for each round.\n\nEach round doubles the previous weight and has a starting weight of 2 of the previous round.\n\nEach time there is a two to the starting weight each previous round.\n\nIt gets the full adult weight (a) by adding the total weight after each round.\n\nThe total weight after each round is then doubled and then divided again to get the dog's final weight.\n\nThe", "answer": " 78"}
{"text": "### Input Answer:\n\n### Rationale:\n\nWhen reading the question, it is important to pay attention to the direction of \"twice as\". In the question, Kenny ran \"twice as long\" as he played basketball. However, Kenny played basketball for 10 hours and practiced the trumpet for 8 hours, therefore, he ran twice as long as he practiced on the tumpet (10/8 = 1.25 hrs). So, 8/1.25 = 6.4 hrs, which rounds to 6 hours.\n\n### Test-Taking Strategy:\n\nIn this question, it is important when you read a word problem to pay attention to the word \"twice as\". The question asks us to identify the times that are twice as long as another time, and to find the sum of these two times. The trick here is to make sure to think about the direction of the \"twice as\" so that you match it with the second time.\n\n### Additional Questions\n\n### Demand:In order to avoid taking too much oxygen, astronauts sometimes take their spacesuits off, where?

{"text": "### Rationales:\n1. 5% increase in the chance of skidding means that if the current chance is 1%, they will then have a chance of skidding 6% of the time. \n2. 40% chance of regaining control means that in 4 out of 10 chances, she will regain control. In the context of this question, if she regains control, she does not get into a serious accident. \n3. We then need to calculate how many times, on average, Annie gets into a serious accident for every time that she skids. Because the chance of regaining control is 40% and the chance of getting into a serious accident is 40% each, and since the latter includes the former as well, we can calculate how many times (on average) she gets into a serious accident by dividing the chance that she'll get into a serious accident by how many times she'll skid. This means if she skids 6% of the total time and then fails to regain control 40% of the time, we can then calculate that on average, she gets a serious accident 60%, or 0.6, of the time that she fails. 4. If the temperature is -8 degrees, what should then be the risk of getting into a serious car accident? Note that the temperate was earlier stated to be -32 + 3(37) + 3(39) + 3(42) + 3(58) + 3(64), or -22 degrees. Given that we also have 6%  chance that she will then, on average, get into a serious accident every time that she skidded, we can calculate that there is a 50% chance that she'll skid every time that her temperature drops by 3 degrees, or every other time that the temperature drops below -32 degrees. 5. The fact that the temperature is -32 degrees means that every time she skids, she also gets into a serious accident 30% of the time. To find out what the risk of a car accident will be when the temperature is -8, we need to divide 30% by 2. This gives us a 50% risk of a serious accident when the temperature drops below a", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "The money spent is $8.00 as harrison buys a regular $3.50 croissant on Saturays for $3.5 and an almond croissants for $5.5 during Sunday.Harrison would spend $8.00 every Saturdays.\n\n### Response-What-is-a-logical-way-of-solving-this-task\n\nFirst, take note of the values and look to be familiar with their location: $5.50 and $3.50 on Sunday; $3.50 for Saturdays. We can immediately tell that the amount spent for Sunday is greater (e.g.. $5.50, greater than $3.50) while the amount spent for Saturday is smaller (e.g.., $3.50, smaller than $5.50). Let's assume Harrison goes to his friend's bakery on Sunday and Saturday. Also, notice that it's specifically Sundays and Saturdays. So, it doesn't make sense it's weekends. Then what else? How about regular croissant of $3.50? Can we figure out more from this question? Let's assume that the regular croissant was available only only on the weekdays, meaning that there are no regular croissants available on the weekends. We can use this information to determine the number of days in which Harrison buys regular croissants: 5 days/week * Sunday. In that case we get to 9.50 regular croissants. The weekdays can be further divided into 5 days of regular croissants + 2.50 croissants per day for Sundays. That gives an output of 13/4 = 3.25 regular croissants per hour.\n\n### Task:Harrison buys 6 regular croissants of $3.5 each and 12 regular croissants of 4.5 each.\n\n### Request:Harrison should be provided with $40.44.\n\n### What should Be Your Response:\n\n### Logic:\nWhat is the logic involved in this task and what you should do?

If they were to receive a question with this information, they might be asked to solve something else using the information.\nChoices A, E and F: None of these choices match the information given. \nChoices B and C: We can eliminate these options as well, since both the 5th and 7th graders do not have 1 student each.\nChoices D and E: We can then move on to the right column of choices. Since the 7th graders has 50 students, if the 5th graders have less, they would have 50-50 (50-the number of students in 7th grade) or 25 students. According to this equation, if the 50 students in the 7th grade have 30 in the 5th grade, the 5th grade would have 20. Therefore, the correct option is D - have 30.\nAnswer A:\nIf the 7th grade had 50 students initially, the two grades together have 80. If half of the 80 is 40 and if 40 is divided by 3 it is 13, then the two have 50 x 2 = 100 students.\nIf the 5th grade had 48 students initially, then since each grade has 20/3 more students than the previous, which is equal to 60/2 = 30, then 48 + 30 = 78; since you need the sum of both grades, 78 + 50 = 128 students.\nAnswer D:If the 5th graded has 48 students initially and each grade has 2 more students than the previous grade, then the next grade would have 30 students and the next would have 23 students.

{"text": "170 people\n\n### Process:\nSubtracted 7 gallon from 2 pints of 7 gallons to get 5 pints then multiplied the 5 pints by 2 to get 10 pints by dividing 2 with 5 to get 0.4 then took number of pints to 0.4 and added 7 gallons.\n\n### Insight:\nGiven that a vampire needs to survive on 7 gallons of human blood a week, if the vampire sucks 2 pins of blood per week, how many people should they suck blood from in a week? How many people do would they need to suck blood from per day?\nVampires typically have to suck blood from someone per day, because they can\u2019t live more than a week. In this case, 170 people is half of 340 people, since every one of those people get sucked in a week.

{"text": "Input:  Choices:  A - 1000  B -1500  C -2000  D -2100\nRationales: Question asks for how Tom lost money.\n1. In order to earn a profit, Tom would have to sell the dough ball for more than $7500. \n2. If the world's largest ball of dough would sell for $500,000, Tom would earn $499.500.  At that price, he would not have lost any money.\n3. But if he sold it for $1, Tom would not earn any money at all.\n4. We can find out his potential earnings by simply subtracting Tom's costs from his profits.  His costs are $:\n+ 500 bags (50lbs each) of flour x $20 each = $10,000\n+ 10 bags of salt x $2 each= $20\n+ Promoting the dough ball= $1000.\n\nWe know he cannot sell the dough ball at a large profit. \n5. Therefore, we can subtract his costs from his profits to get Tom's earning potential per dough ball: $399500-$508= $394412. \n6. Now we divide this amount by the number of dough balls he sold, i.e., 500.  This gives us a net profit per ball, or Tom's earnings per dough ball:  $3944= 39440=$39440.\n\nWe see that Tom can potentially earn about $39,440 per dough ball.  Given we know he only sold his dough balls for $20 each, we can find that his actual earnings were a far cry from his potential earnings:  $39,4000 x 500 = $19,700,00.\n\nAnswers to show where his profits and revenues could be used to increase his earnings to potential levels:\n+ Selling more tickets at a higher price: 501 x $20 x 10", "answer": " 8798"}

{"text": "The question describes the situation of Bob and Jim who are running at 6 miles per hour and 9 miles per hour respectively. They run with a 1 mile headstart in the race; the question is asking how much time it will take for Jim to catch up to Bob.\n\nWe can tell that Bob's speed is 6 miles per hour because his friend Jim is running at 9 miles per second in the race, and 1 mile is 60 minutes. That means that both of them have to complete a distance of 60 mi/6 mi=10 mi/h per hour to cover the 60 mi/minute of 6 miles in 1 hour. The number means that the two of them are moving at a speed of 10 miles per hour in order to be able to cover the 6-mile distance in an hour, and that 10 miles per second is Bob's speed.\n\nTo find the time, we need to use the concept of time taken per mile. We can use the formula to find the rate at which the distance is covered: rate = change in displacement / time. In terms of rate, we are talking about the miles per hour. If we set d = 6, then the units cancel and we are left with the formula rate = v.\n\nBased on the formula, we can conclude that the rate of Bob's movement is 10 miles per hours, which is the distance in one hour. However, Jim moves at a rate of 9 miles per hour, which equals d in the above formula or a rate of 9 mph.\n\nBecause the difference between the numbers is 0.9 miles per minute difference, we can simplify our calculation using the method of time differences between two objects (6 miles / 1 mile = 1 hour, 0.9 miles/1 mile = 9/10 times).\n\nFor the math problem above, we use the equation for the rate given by v=d/t where the variables are changed from miles to minutes, and 10 miles/hour is substituted to give the new rate 10 mph/minute. After that, a rate of 9mph/10mph is set to use in the rest of the calculations to find the time it takes Jim to catch up to his competitor.\n\nWhen solving the question, we need to start", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "Input:Bella bought stamps at the post office.Some of the stamps had snowflake, truck, and rose designs. Bella bought 9 more truc stamps than snowflea stamps.\nRationales:Reasoning:\n\nWe know that the question is asking us how many stamps Bella bought in all.\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of stamps she bought with the snowflake designs.\n\nSince it says that she bought 11 stamps with the snowflakes, we know that there are 11 snowflea stamps in total.\n\nNow, to find the amount of truck stamps she bought, we need to find how many truck stamps she didn't buy, or how many less.\n\nSince she bought 9 more trukc stamps than those with the snowflave designs, we know that if she bought a snowflake stamp, she bought an equal number of truck stamps, making the amount of truckstamps 30.\n\nThus, she bought 11 snow flakes stamps, and 9 more truckstamps than snowflakes stamps.\n\nNow, since we need to find the total of the stamps, we need to find out how many rose stamps she bought.\n\nRose stamps were more expensive, so it is likely that she bought less of them. Thus, we can assume that 13 rose stamps were cheaper.\n\nHaving solved the first 3 problems, we know:\n\n11 snowflakes = 30 trucks = 13 roses\n\nAnd because we know the number of more truck stamps, and the number of less rose stamps, our solution is:\n\n13 fewer rose stumps than truck stamps = 38.\n\nHowever, this needs work. Let's just say there were 15 more truck stamps then snowflakes. Now, we know:\n13 fewer rose = 14\n14 + 38 = 52.\n\nNow, she bought a total amount of 52 stamps.\n\nAnswer: B: 52 stamps", "answer": " 38"}

The next step is to figure out how the boat transport people on each day.\n3. There are 4 boat trios on each day. Since we now know that each boat trip can take 12 people, we also know that each day has a total of 44 people in the boat.\n4. But remember, there are 2 days, so we must multiply the total number of people by 2. Therefore, the number at each day is 2 x 44 = 88.\n5. We also know that the boat can take 12 or 13 people each trip. Therefore, each trip can transport 7 or 8 people.\n6. If the boat could transport 12 people each trip, then there are 6 trips for day 1 and 6 trips for days 2. Therefore, 2 x 6 = 12 people on days 1 and 2.\n7. On day 1, 12 people are in the boat, meaning that 12 - 12 = 0 people are in it.\n8. So, there will be 2 empty seats available next to the 12 people in the boat and 3 people remaining on the beach.\n9. On day 2, 13 people are in the boat. Therefore, there are 13 - 13 = 0 people remaining on the beach who are not in the boat.\n10. The total number of people in the boat for Day 1 and Day 2 is 12 + 13 = 25.\n11. The total number of emtpy seats in the boat for Day1 and Day 2 are 12 - 0 =12.  \n12. And finally, the total number of people on the beach for day 1 and Day 1 is 2 which is equal to 3 since 3 is left on the beach.\n13. 12 * 25 = 280, so therefore there are 280 seats in", "answer": " 96"}

We can find the value of the sum by applying the given statement: when the first two integers are summed, the result is 13. Therefore, 13 can be represented as 5+8. Now, we know that 5 + 6 = 11 and 5 + 10 = 15.\n2. We also know that when we sum the first three integers, the result is always a multiple of six.\n3. So, the sum of 1,2 and 3 is 6, the sum of 2,3 and 4 is 6, the of 3,4 and 5 is 6, the 4,5 and 6 is also 6.\n4. Summing up, we know that the sum of 1 to 6 is 36.

{"text": "Sheila probably isn't being practical when she suggests how Randy could become a master in his field by practicing so many hours a day. Assuming that Randy begins practicing piano when he turns 12, this means that he has 10 years to reach this goal.  This doesn't sound like a lot of time to Randy because 10 years goes very quickly.  Sheila's plan for Randy to take two weeks of vacation each year might even be too much for Randy. If Randy spends 5 hours a day on vacation instead of practicing his piano he will spend 3650 hours practicing piano and 1800 hours on vacation throughout his life.  So even if Randy took only 2 weeks of vacation throughout his life he'd still need to practice 1800/5 = 360 hours more than he did on vacation to be an expert.\n\n### Incorrect:  Not sure the response is correct, but if you have a 40-hour work week and take 8 vacation weeks throughout your life that's 4 weeks per year, 365 vacation days, and 0.0777 years on vacation.\n\n### Corrected:  Sheila's formula for working out how long somebody should practise does not take into account time off. Taking breaks helps people stay less tired - it also allows for holidays. To take breaks and holidays, Randy would have to practise more in total than what's in Sheila's equation. For example, in the first year if Randy spends 4925 hours practising, works the rest of the year and takes holidays for the rest of his life, it would still not get him to'mastery'.\n\nAnswer:  Randy needs to spend a little over 34 hours a day to become an expert in piano before he will be 20.

Each person in the option is likely to be a candidate to get the property if the king was to die, the correct answer will be the person who is most likely to get the property. Since the given options are not completely random, we can use elimination or probability to answer this question.\n\n1) The queen is not the heir to the property. This is because the question states that the king has died. The queen is also not the daughter and cat (since both the daughter and cat do not answer the question)\n\n2) The prince is the son to the king and is likely to be the heir to the castle. Hence the queen can be ruled out here.\n\nTherefore the only two options left are The prince and The daughter.

{"text": "Input: The question says Jake spent $2800 and spent the remainder of his money. We should consider what this means before answering this question.\n\nAs Jake's remaining money was split in half, that means that Jake had $5000 - $2800 = $2200 left. Now if Jake spent half that money, then that means he had $1100 left.\n\nFrom this figure, we can deduce what Jake's balance is. If the cost for a concert ticket was a fourth of his remaining, then it was $275.\n\nSince Jake didn't buy a concert ticket, we can deduce that he lost a fourth of what he had left. He had $1101 left, losing $275, means the new balance after a fourth of a dollar is 1101 - 275 = $826.\n\nNow, if the new balance was $826, then we can work backward and plug in $5000, the initial balance, which will result in Jake having $274 left of his remaining money, which means the final balance is $2200 - $274 = $1926.\n\nTo recap, Jake's final balance is $1926, meaning he was left with the correct figure.\n\n### Input:- What number or quantity is in the parenthesis given the statement 20 + (7 - 5) is 38?\n\n### A response:\n\nThe parenthesis are closed-up parentheses.

{"text": "In this question, the word \"each\" means every book in the series has what? Choices: A: 200 pages B: 4 pages C: half a page D: half a series E: half the pages\n\n### Rationale: As the question implies, the \"each\" refers to every book/volume in the series.\n1) The question implies, that there is 14 books in all so the total pages is 2800 and not 14x200.\n2) If \"each\" implies a series then we have to sum up all of those individual totals which adds to 2800.\n3) When you divide 200 by 2= 100 pages per book so half of 200 should be equal to half the number and that is 100+50=150.\n4) The books are 200 pages long so if they are half they should be a 100 pages so 1+0 (half) or 100 pages.\n5) The question says \"she read four books in a months and half the number of the books remaining in the second months\" which is 2 so that makes it 4x100 (the first month) + (0.5x100+100) the second which makes it 400.\n6) 400+150 is equal to 550\n\n### Input\"In a basketball game, there are three possessions for each half.

The third number is the remainder after the second number is subtracted from the first number.\n### Rationales: Input The scenario: A bag gets torn and half of sugar falls to the ground; there are 4 bags, each bag has 6 kilos of sugar; there are 24 kilos in all.\n\nOutput: The solution is a decimal because there are 24, 12, 6, and 2.4 kilos left in each bag.\n\nAnswer:2. C.\n\n### Rational: This question is an open domain question. If it is not clear in the prompt, the teacher should specify the type of answer. For example, the teacher should not expect to get an answer like 1,235 which is the total value of money.\nTo answer this question, you have to use division, multiplication, and subtraction.\nFirst you will need to divide 24 by 4 to find out how many bags of sugar there are. So 24/4 = 6 kilos. Since you want that amount to be even, you need to do some math to see what the remainder of the answer is after dividing 24/4.\nTo find that remainder you will need to multiply 24/4 by 4 because you are dividing (24/4)/4.\nOnce you know the remainder or what is left over after dividing 2 by 4 (the remainder is 0.) You can use the inverse operation (multiplication) to undo the division (24/4 =12/4 = 3) and then subtract 3 from 24 to get 21 as the result. Finally you can find the answer by putting it back into the equation. 24/4 - 3 = 21. Each bag has 6 plus 3 kilos and left with 21 - so 21 - 21 is 0.

From that he can figure out which farmer has the most land. Once he has those numbers, he can deduce how much each farmer needs and divide by the total, to figure out how much each farmer receives.\n\nCary knows that the total water amount is 140 gallons per acre, and the total amount of land for the farmers is 96 acres. So the total amount of water needed for each farmer is 140 x 96 = 13,360 gallons. \n\n### We know that Farmer Bob, who uses corn, uses twice as much water as the other two farmers combined.

Peanuts are sold in packs of 6 and the stuffed animal is not individually sold.\n2. The cashier would have given $1 back if Linda had bought one of each. Linda had bought one stuffed animal.

The question is asking for the maximum weight passengers that can be inside the elevator without being overloaded, but assuming the average amount of passengers that can sit, is 40 people. Subtracting the two children off of the 40 passengers, the adults weight (2.4 x 140) minus ((2.4 x 64) /0.6) then adding that to the maximum allowed. The maximum number of people to put in the elevator is (40 + 440 - (2 * 64)) (100 + 140 - (14 * 6)) (40 + 580 - 92), is 532. 532 is closer to 601 pounds than 40 or 41, so it answers in 601 people plus is 550 people.

When the boy got out the dark he ran into a big, scary bear! The bear quickly caught up to him and asked for directions home. What question did the scared boy ask the bear?\n\n### Answer: How the heck did you get here?!\n\n### Answer Explanation:\nThis question requires you to look at all the options we have, and pick out any additional details that would be irrelevant, and thus could be dropped. In this case, the options are \u201cWhich way did the bear go?\u201d and \u201cHow far away were you?\u201d. \u201cWhich way did he go\u201d, is not in the story, and is irrelevant. \u201cHow far away were \u2018you\u2019\u201d is redundant, and does not add anything new to the story. Thus it is the easiest to remove, leaving the best choices as \u201cWhich way did you go?\u201d and \u201cHow big are you?\u201d. The bear was very angry and wanted to know what direction to go in, since he had taken \u201ca shortcut\u201d. In addition, that line in the story suggests that this is not common, if the boy took the path less travelled in the first place. \u201cHow big are you\u201d would take too long and could be solved with more direct means such as a weapon or running.

You can think of an apple as a snack if you need to, but it's not what the tree expects from you or thinks of it as. It's not why the tree produced it either.\n2. Apples aren't gifts. You can give them away, but that's different.\n3. Apples aren'the a prize for achievement, they're just a thing to eat. And the apple tree probably doesn't care or expect extra attention if you eat one.\n4. That leaves us with D: a prize and E: the last fruit. \n5. The last fruit implies there are other food options for this tree, and it's not really a big deal that you are taking the last one. It's not like the apple tree expects you to give it any attention afterward. This leaves us with the answer E: the last fruit\nAnswer: E: the last fruit \n\n### Input \"The teacher asked students to turn in their tests.\"   Choices: 1: A: homework 2: B: homework 3: C: projects 4: D: tests 5: E: quizzes\nRationales:The students were not expected to turn in their homework, projects, or quizzes. Homework and projects are separate from the tests that were turned in. A quiz is considered a test as well, and it is not what the teacher was referring to. All of this supports our conclusion that the correct answer is  D: tests.\n\n### Justifiication\nI used the reasoning of a student asking the teacher what kind of homework is due tomorrow  and what's the homework for the weekend? That shows a clear understanding that homework and projects are separate entities form a test or quiz", "answer": " 1825"}

Two students A: 15 and B: 16 years old. (Choices: A: 30 years B: 45 years C: 39 years D: 71 years E: 44 years) The correct answer here would be C, because it's only a question of how old the two students are. We don\u2019t actually know how long they\u2019ve been taking math classes, (though it\u2019s easy to estimate that they\u2019ve both been doing it their whole lives).\n\nAnswer: C\n\n### Why:\n* The original question was asking for the age of the two students.\n* The math classes is an irrelevant detail and was only included to see how old the students were.\n* The question would remain the same even if the two students were 70 years old, as long as they still had math classes under their belt. Thus, it is irrelevant for the sake of the question, and the answer should be C, since we can deduce that the two students are at least 15.\n\n### Input\nA: Did the two go in the same bathroom?

Because, they're coming from the plane, the passengers come out, there might be some restrooms out there in the front for the passengers to go to. There are also bathrooms on the side. A: goes into the restrooms on the side.\n\nWhy?: Because, this is what makes sense, the airplane will go through customs, if it lands in US, then it has to go through customs.

{"text": "The number of votes was 86.\n\n### Rationale: To get to the answer, we start by first looking at given data. This allows us to draw a conclusion and get the answer.\n1. We know that there were 3 times as many votes for the unicorn in comparison to the witch, so we conclude that there must be twice as many votes for unicorns as witches. In total, that equates to 8 votes for unicorn.\n2. Similarly, to the previous point, we know that there are 25 more votes for dragons in comparison with witches, so we know that we must get the number of dragon votes and witch votes.\n3. To get the total number of votes for these contestants we combine the numbers previously given and apply 8 (for unicorn) and 25 (for dragon) to the given 7 for witch. Thus, we get the answer of 87 for the total number of votes.\n\n### Test cases:\n\n> Test case 1\n\nQuestion text: In the baking contest, 100 people voted for the frog cake compared to 95 people for the unicorn.

After the most recent purchase, Elise ended up with 35kg of food total, giving her an inventory of 15 kilograms plus an additional 20 kilograms. Elise's initial inventory can be calculated with the equation: initial inventory = 15 kg + 20 kg, or total inventory = 35 kg.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nBy calculating the amount of dog food total available after purchases and adding inventory that existed prior to purchases together, Elise's inventory can be calculated.

C: it is tap water \nRationales\nC(c): Tap water is considered safe drinking water provided there is no algae in it (as mentioned earlier in the question's context).\nThrough logic, we are able to deduce that the cement pond is one or the other: PQ,  or  PC. These options can then be eliminated because either it has algae and is not fresh water (PQ), or it is tap water and therefore safe to drink (PK).\nThis leaves us with CP, which is the only answer left.\n3. B: it contains algae \nRationales \nB(b): This is a trick question. By stating that the water from the cemen pond is fresh, the questioner is using the connotation of being \"clean\" against the connotation that the water is \"safe\".\nIf the water is safe, it cannot contain algae because it would be unsafe to drink if it did. Hence, C(c) is the only remaining option now.\nHowever, the reader has stated that it does contain algae. At the same time, the reader indicates that the water is fresh and therefore safe to drink.

Therefore, it's clear that 0.6 is not at least 60%, because the result is less than 60%. In fact, it's lower by almost half.\n\nSimilarly, if you take option B (120) and multiply it with 0.6 you get 72. So, not only is 0.6 not at least 69, but it's actually lower than 70%.\n\nIf we assume that 30% = 0.6, then we must conclude that 0.6 * 60 is greater than 80.

{"text": "10 minutes is the time needed for the assignment. Taking that time out of total time it will make it 30 minutes for Tina to finish, this means she needs 15/30.\n\n### Input (Addendum):\nIn addition, Tina wants dinner to be ready by 5:30 and wastes time of 3:45 making time of 4 hours until dinner to finish homework.\n\n### Rationales\nThe question here is regarding how long Tina will be cleaning her sticky keyboard. She knows that the process would take 3 minutes per key, so her time will be 40 minutes (15 keys x 3 minutes per key). If she had just wasted 3:45 of the time, then that is another 12 minutes. Total time = 40 minutes + 12 minutes. If she had cleaned her whole keyboard, the last two steps of her process is to clean her remaining 14 keys. So now, since she had already taken into consideration the cleaning of her first key, it'd be better to just clean 13 keys.\n\nThe time to clean 13 keys would be 40 minutes multiplied by 13/15 (the ratio at the time) instead of 40 minutes.\n\n### Response (Addendum):\nHer total time left to clean her remaining 2 keys and finish homework is\n[40 min + (12/3 min x 13 keys)](https://www.google.com/search?q=13%2F15+ratios+%3D+%2840/3+min+%29+x+12&ssui=on&ei=wu3WY8-hF9OjrQX_6q28Bg&oq=13%3F15+rations) = 6:55\n\n### Output:\nThe question asks about the number of minutes it would take Tina to clean her keyboard since that is the only part of homework she needs to focus on.

{"text": "Based on the information provided in the original sentence, we can determine that there are a few things to consider before determining the answer to this question.\n\nOne thing is that the question says Ruth's father told her how long her fish can live. This implies that her fish is well-cared for. If the fish is not well-cared for, it is likely to have a shorter lifespan than if it is well-cared.\n\nWe also know that dogs live 4 times longer than hamsters and on average, hamsters live 2 years. This implies that dogs have a longer average lifespan than hamsters and can potentially live a longer period. It is also worth noting that Ruth's father told Ruth that well-cared for hamsters can live an extra 4 times as long than hamsters do, which implies that the lifespan of a well-cared for dog could be much longer than its average lifespan.\n\nTherefore we can state that the answer to the question is that Ruth's fish can potentially live a longer than Ruth's father told it is able to.

Choices: A: <= cm C: <= b\nB: <= mn D: <= mn - cm\nRationales: (1) Each triangle has two angles with measures l and m. 180\u00ba = 90\u00ba + 90\u00ba because a + b = 180. (2) In statement 2, one of the angles must be twice that of the other angle. So, l = m because a + b = l + m = 180\u00ba, l and m = 90\u00ba (and l = m because 90\u00ba cannot be divided by 2; a + b = l = 90\u00ba because each triangle has 2 angles so a + b = 90\u00ba; 90\u00ba is twice another 90\u00ba.).

It also asks what the total number of addresses that all three of them gave altogether is.\nThe statement could be summarized as saying the following:\nGovernor Sandoval 2x as many commencement speeches as governor Hawkins Governor Sloan gave ten commencement addresses more than governor Sandoval in the same time period all three gave total 12 speeches\n12 speeches = Gov Sandoval + governor Hawkins speeches + Gov Sloan speeches the sum of the values of all three\n\n### Difficulty:\nThe question is clear but contains three different terms. The only way of knowing that they each refer to the same value is by reading the sentences before and after.\n\n### Example of good thinking:\nThe first step is to convert the terms to a number because it is easier. To do this we substitute 'x' for each occurrence of the word 'twice'. We then multiply by '2'\n\nGov Hawkins 12 commencements\nGov Sandoval 24 commencements\nIn the same amount of time the 3 of them gave 36 commencements\n\nThen solve for 'x': 24 = 36, x = 9\n### Alternate response could have been:\nFirst, divide 12 by two and take the remainder. The remainder will help you calculate the total commencement addresses given by all three governors.\n\n12 divided by 2 = 6\n2 commencement speeches by Sandoval and Hawkins.\nThen, add the remainder of 2. This is because 12-2 = 10 \n\n10 = 4 commencement addresses given from Sloan. \n\nFinal answer: all three gave a total of 16 commencement addresses.\n\n### Commentary:\nThere are more efficient ways to answer this question, but this is a good response for a beginner. It demonstrates that the student understands how to interpret the numbers in the question and also understands the directions, as it provides a detailed breakdown of the number of commencements given. However, it may take more time than a simple calculation to do it this way, so it isn't recommended as a shortcut to solve this", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "The number of pages that Tom can read if he increased his reading speed by a given factor is equal to the original number of pages reading speed increase times the given factor divided by the original number of pages. In the example in which Tom is reading one page per minute, at 2 hours the speed will be 1.5 times faster as 1 hour = 1 minute and 2 hours = 120 minutes. 150 minutes divided by 120 minutes gives 1 50/120 which gives 1 5/12. Now, 1 page = 1200 words. One page = 12 books = 12 x 1200 = 14400 words. So, 1 page = (1 x 12 = 12 pages) =12 x 1440 = 16800 words.

{"text": "The answer is 42!\n\n### Rationale:\nStep 1) Identify the unknown variable: We don't know the number of cows. We know the number of liters(Q) of milk they produce, and we know the number of weeks. Let's call that x. So x represents the number of cows on the farm.\nStep 2) Isolate the Quantity on Which the Problem is Based: In this case the question is asking about a specific quantity (the number of liters) being multiplied by a variable (the number of weeks).\nStep 3) Evaluate Based on the Context: The context in this question can be interpreted as \"each cow produces an average of 108 litres of milk per week, after 5 of those weeks, the total amount of milk produced is 2160 Litres,\"\nStep 4) Determine a Unit-to-Units Relationship: According to the question, the milk per week and the quantity of milk produced after 5 weeks were measured in litres. So, we don't need a conversion.\nStep 5) Isolate the Variable: To solve this problem, we need to first isolate the x, or number of cows, and we can do this by dividing the 2160 by 6. So the relationship is 216(given that x was unknown originally) \u00f7 x = 6. This means that x = 360(cows)\n\nHence, \"On a farm every group of 6 cows produces approximately 108 litre each week. Which is a total of 360 (cows) x 108(litres) = 39,440\"\n\n### Input One:Where is your backpack?

{"text": "In answer to the question how many ants can be in the jar after a given number of hours. \n### Solution: The question states that if we have 50 ants in the jar at the beginning of hour \"t\" then the number of ants doubles in an hour and this means after one hour there will be 100 ants in the container. After 2 hours we would end up with 200 ants in our jar. From here we simply multiply our starting number by 2 and take that and raise it to the power of n, which is the number of hours. So essentially, 100(2^{5}) if 1 means that 100(5 to the power of 2) we end up with 5,120 ants in the glass jar at the end of the five hours.\n\n### Additional notes: As we increase the powers of n, the number of an in the jar also multiplies very quickly until the number of ants reaches 6,654,591,253,788,000,000 ants.\n\n### Reference: https://brainly.com/question/2146136", "answer": " 1600"}

{"text": "The first place where we should try to see the problem from Kevin\u2019s point of view is 6th. As we read we get a chance to see the exact difference we have between Kevin and Alan. Kevin can eat 64 per minute and Alan can eat 5 per minute. That gives us the difference we have between them; the difference is 64-5 which is 62. And so we should try our best to make sure the difference between what Alan is eating per minute and what Kevin is is greater than 62. To do that, we need to make the difference between the two greater than the previous difference i.e. 62 and the difference we have is going to be what. If we are trying to make the difference in seconds, in 8 minutes it will be what. So the exact answer is 760 but the options give us 755 which is almost as good as the solution given. The way a question will always be solved is we are given the numbers and we just put that difference in place of the variable we are given. So the exact answer would be 760-1. This is the first step to every problem on the task and all the questions we get is going to follow the same steps so we can just remember the first answer we found here.\n\n\n\n### Input :  There were four students, two boys and two girls in a classroom. It was a math test. The teacher gave the class five problems. If the boy got two right, one wrong, and the girl got all four right, who was the smartest student?\n\n### Dem: The question is that we should look at the given variables and what could be happening to them. We see the given variables which are x and y. We also know the teacher gave five problems. This gives us an idea that we have two more problems left. If we know the numbers given are 2 and 4 we can just get the exact number of how many questions we have left. The solution is x and y. Now the part where we would have to know is where are they looking at the questions. Now if the boy got two right answers, one wrong and girl got all four right then it can only mean that they have answered five questions and still have two questions left to answer. This means x and y variables will have to equal five. This means that the boy will have to be able to get 4", "answer": " 4"}

Let us look for clues in the sentence.\n\nThe question begins by stating that a thought bubble popping in someone's head might cause them to say \"Oohh.\" This suggests that the speaker was experiencing some form of response or feeling in reaction to the thought.\n\nNext, the question asks us whether the thinker was daydreaming or had experienced a moment of enlightment. This implies that either the thought bubble had led to a moment of reflection or provided a sudden insight (a moment of enlightenement).\n\nTherefore, this is all the information we have to go on, and the answer to the question is B: Moment of enlightenment.\nAnswer: B: Moment of Enlightenment\n\n### Input:\"The kids are playing their instruments, aren't' they?\"\n\n### Demosration:\nInput:\"The kids are __________ aren't they?\" : To find what is missing, we must identify the context of the sentence.

E: 12\nRationales: Common factors are numbers that evenly divide into two numbers without any remainder.\n6. To find the common factor of a number and another number, you must first identify the factors of each number and then find the set of factors that occur in both numbers.\n7. You divide each number by all its factors to get the least common multiple (LCM), which is the product of every combination of the factors that the two numbers share.\n8. So, if we divide 12 and 18 by each one of their factors, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, respectively, we get the following numbers:\n\n12/1 = 12 12/2 = 6 12/3 = 4 12/4 = 3 12/6 =  2\n18/1 = 18 18/2 = 9 18/3 = 6 18/6 =  3\n9.

According to his survey of 60 students, 50 surveyed students get an average of $6 a day and the remaining 10 students receive $8 a day. His survey revealed that a total of $40 is allocated for the entire group. What is the average allowance for the entire group?\n\n### Instructions:\nComplete the task and write as requested.\n\n### Rationales:\nI reasoned that this task was asking for a certain value to be worked out to. I used the given information in the problem, and plugged it into my formula, solving for the desired answer.\n\nTo find the correct answer, I began with the given information.\nIn this problem, $30 is allocated in the entire group of 60 students. The group can be broken down into two subgroups of 50 and 10. The subgroup of 50 has an average of $6 per student a day, and it is given that they can be allocated a total of $30. Since that was what I had to work with for the first group of 50 students, I set that information aside for the time being.\n\nUsing the information given of $8 per student per day for the other group of 10, I then plugged that number into the formula to see how the sum would shake out. In the formula, 10 is plugged into place of n, the remaining is plugged into the formula, and in this case the values are n=10 and remainder =12.\n\nAfter a little while of experimenting with the formula and writing down possible answers in the equation, I arrived at this equation:\n```\nSolution = 11.4.\n```\n\nThat answer is correct for the provided information.

If we divide 29, 30, and 29 by each can's oil, it will give a different value than given as correct.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe correct response for this question is to divide 290 by the number of cans minus the number of cans with 8 litres of oil.

Its sound made me go weak in my knees because it reminded me of her.\"\n\nYou are trying to identify the bird in this poem.\n\nThe only bird mentioned in the passage is a mockingbird. The word \"singing\" tells you that it is indeed a male singing to get a female. When the word \"weak in my knees\" is used to describe someone \"falling in love\" it references a female falling in love with a male, the mockingbird. This is because when a female mockingbird is imitating a male of the same species the sounds can be indistinguishable. And thus, what you should do is identify the male singers within the sound of a mockingbird and there aren't any.\n\nTherefore the bird in question is either the mockingbird itself or an example of when the female mockingbird is singing.\n\n### Rationale: Since we know it is not a male mockingbird, we know that the bird we are looking is the female mockingbird. The female mockingbird has a special ability to not only sing like a male mockingbird she can also sound extremely similar to other bird species, especially species of the thrush family. This is referred to as \"false imitation\".\n\n### Rationales:\nThe poem is describing love, that is why there is a reference to knees that represent weakness.\n\nThe \"sound\" referred to sounds similar with a male mockingbird singing. A male mockingbird can imitate the sound of any bird it wants, including itself, but can the female also imitate the sound? \n\nAnswer: Female Mockingbird\n\n### Input and Rationales: Since the female mockingbird can immitate other types of bird sounds, the birds are not all the same.

{"text": "The question wants us to calculate how many slices there are after Mr. Keith and 24 classmats take 1 slice. So the answer is 96.\n\n### Input\n1. Driving 50 miles in an hour, we find that we have travelled 50 miles in this amount of time. Thus, we can say that we have driven 50 miles in one hour, which is another way to say we have driven 5 miles per hour.\n2. In the example of a car travelling 50 miles in 1 hour, the car is driving with an average speed of 50 miles per hour. In the above example, it was the opposite: 5 miles per hour (in the direction we travelled at slower compared to the hour we travelled). The car moved with an average speed of: (50 - 5)/5 = 36 miles per hour.\n3. Speed in a 2-hour long race would be 2\u00d736 miles per hour = 72 miles per hour. \n\n### Response\n\n1. The question asks us to simplify this equation by dividing both sides  by 36.\n2. If the equation for the car speed was 50 miles per 1 hour, then its average speed is 50/60 = \u00bd hour/60. Or an average of 10 mph.\n3. The second average speed is 5/60. Or 5/36 = 1/7. Or 14.285 mph.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The first example 50 miles in a hour implies dividing the mileage by the same number.  \n2. When you do that you get one hour, since 50/50=1.\n3. The other 2 examples say that in the first one we drove 50 miles in the hour that we drove.\n4. This means that the speed of the car is 50 miles per one hour.\n5. In the last answer it says that we drove 5 miles per hour and 5 hours.\n6. This means that we drove at a speed of 5/5 which is 1/0.5 which is 2.

Therefore, the correct unit would be feet, not m. \n\n### Input 6: In an office consisting of 10 employees, three more were working on the project.

The penguins want to be in \"warm seal pools\" or \"warm seal dens.\" This implies that they are looking for a warmer environment than the frigid temperatures outside.\n3. The two penguins did not want to be \"in the sea\" but are rather just heading to a warm ocean.\n4. Neither B: north pole nor C: warmer ocean is a possible choice because it is not specified where the penguins want to go or where they already are.\n5.

{"text": "64\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The only way you could get a perfect 100 score is to choose option E: 64, and I have been asked to come here to explain how we got to the correct answer.\n2. Let's talk about the most obvious choice (Option A: 15) first. At first, we don't see why 15 would be the correct response, but when you consider that options E, B, and C are all evenly in between them, 15 is a good bet. The snakes are not multiples of 2 feet, so option D won't work, and we've already considered option E, so that doesn't work either.\n3. The only answer we have left is option A: 15. Unfortunately, in this simple fraction, the numerator is not divisible by the denominator.\n4. So here is how we get option E - 64. To determine the snake's size, we must first determine how long each snake is in inches. Option A: 15 is 8 inches longer than option B: 2 (2 + 8 = 10).\n5. To figure out how many inches each snake is, we must subtract 50 from their combined total. Option D: 58 is 8 feet (2 x 5) + 16 feet. Now, we get 2 + 16 = 18.\n6. Let's look at option C: 42. It seems very close, but we have to calculate its total. 8 + 16 + 10 + 50 equals 90. Option A is 8 short of that, and option E is 60 short of that.\n7. So option B is the best. To sum up the number of inches each snake is (1 + 2 + 10 +16 + 19 feet): Option C: 42 is short 80. Option D: 2 is short by 162 feet and option E: 67 is short by 178 feet, so option C: 49 seems to be the best.\n8. However, since they are combined, the snakes need to add up to 104.

Choices:  D: one to five A: two to one hundred B: three to seventy five C: four to thirty seven E: five to twenty five\nRationales: The question mentions that both numbers are two-digit numbers in place values of \"tens\" and \"ones\".\n1. The place value of tens represents ten times the number represented by the digits in that place.\n2. The place value of ones represent one times the number represented by digits in that place. \n3. So, if a number has two digits, the digits in ones place and tens place need to multiply to give the value of the number.\n4. This means that option A (number six times number two) needs to be ruled out because numbers 6, 2, and 62 represent values that are more than ten times their original place values. In order to represent such values, you have to use three-digit numbers.\n5. Options D, E, and B are incorrect because these describe values between one hundred and seventy-five respectively.

{"text": "The answer is 6.67% because to get the 6.67%. Let's explain a bit the idea. The equation we need to solve this problem is ($200) (1.20). This is how you write 20% into the equation. Now when we solve the $200 (1.20), we get $240. We can see from this that for every $200, we add $24. If we want to convert this to percentage, we need to divide it by $200. When we divided it by 200, this is how much percent we got: (24/200) * 100 = 6.67 %.

The question's statement mentions that Carrie will need wrapping paper for three birthday presents, and also states that square feet of wrapping paper is required to cover each of the three presents.\n2. The first present needs wrapping paper that requires an area of two square feet to cover it. The second present needs wrapping paper that takes up an area of ______ square feet. The third present requires the same amount of wrapping paper as both the first and the second presents combined.\n3. The only present that needs an area of two square foot is the first one.\n4.

{"text": "Look at the question carefully and the choices. Karen\u2019s work tote is twice the weight of Kevin\u2019s briefcase means that Karen\u2019s work bag weighs 2*16 = 32 pounds and Keven\u2019s weighs 40 pounds, giving Karen a 8 pounds advantage over Kevin. In the next part, it says when Kevin weighs 16*16=256 and Karen\u2019s weighs twice which is 48, the total weighs of the two bags is 48+256=304 which is a 20 pounds advantage for Kevin. Kevin\u2019s work weighs a sixth of the weight in his full briefcase, which means Kevin\u2019s work weigs 16 pounds. Karen\u2019s bag is twice the weigh of Kevin\u2019s so the weight in Karen\u2019s bag would be 32. Then Kevin work weighs a half of the weight in the full briefcase which mean Kevin\u2019s weighs half at the beginning or 16 pound. Then the tota weight of the two bags and the laptop is: 32 + 16 +16 = 64.

The first part of the question mentions that Karen\u2019s bag when empty is twice the weight of the briefcase and the second part mentions that when Kevin puts his work papers is the briefcase then the total weight in the bags is a sixth of the weigh of the laptop. We have to figure out how to distribute the poundage in the bags so that the two bags weigh same amount without taking the laptop. In the first part we take the weights of the brieftcase as (16*14) 224 that leaves only 72. Then adding the laptop weight subtracting the workpaper weight (16*16) we get 16*32 = 512 which is more then 72 so the sum of the two bags would be more then their empty weight so their full weight would be more then half their empty weight.

Let's say that all the dresses were on sale on 50%.\nWe can repeat the process we did for the shoes : $100 - 40% = $60\nWe will need to know how many dresses has purchased to know the total money spent.\nThe process is $100 - $60 = $40\nNext step, $40 - 20% = 32\nFinally, the total amount of money Daniel has spent is $100 + $60 + 32 = $192\n\n### Demostration:\nInput:\n### Detailed Answers:\nIf you are a woman and you have 3 kids and earn 100 dollars a month can you have more than a total of 155 dollars if you pay for food, water, and more than 150 dollars a month.\n\n### Solution:\nYou pay for your food. One month, the food costs a total of $105. Therefore, you have 105 $- 100 Dollars/month = 5 Dollars.\nThe next month, water costs 80 Dollars. Therefor, you have 80 Doll - 100 Dollar/month = -20 Dollars\nIn the third month, clothes cost you 170 Dollars, so you end up with 170 Dollar - 100 dollar/month = 70 Dollars.\nYou add all results together: Your total amount of money is 105 dollars, 80 dollars, and 70 dollars. Which all together total to 255 dollars. \n\n#### Reasoning\nSo you can have in total 255/3 $85,23 dollars\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite the most appropriate response to the following instruction:\n\n### Input", "answer": " 140"}

{"text": "The answer to this question is $49.3 million.\n\n### Rationale: The given information in this question implies that the movie cost $6 to produce.\n\n### 1. We know that movies cost different amounts to produce. The $60 million we were given could represent the entire cost of production, or it could mean that the production company would use that amount to produce another movie in the series.\n\n### We do know that the movie made three and a half times more money than it costs. If it was made for $60, million, that means it made an additional $13 million.\n\n2.  We can subtract this additional $13 million from the $60 million we are asked about.\n\n3. When we subtract $47 million from $60 million, we get $13 million. This means the actual cost of production is $60 \u2013 $47 = $13 million. We know that the movie made $49.36 million, which means that the gross profit was $49.3 \u2013 $13 = $36.3 million. Divide that by six. We want 60%, which is $36.3/1.6 = $22.58 million, and round.\n\n### If necessary, we should make sure that $60 million represents the actual cost of production, and not total cost.\n\n### For instance, a horror movie may be made for $60 million in total, of which $40 million may be attributed to marketing costs. If we take the cost of production to be $40 million, then $60 million may represent total cost.\n\nInput: This picture is from the 1940s and it shows where people had to get groceries at night because they had to what?

He can jump three times per second as long as a rope is at least ten feet long.\n\n### Explanation:The given options are in line with my initial assumptions of the given problem.  It can be seen that the given is for rope jumping, that the record is 54064 and that there is a limit of 10ft rope used to jump.  Now applying this given information, I can see that there are no limiting factors and we can apply the simple method of working out 54063 in 3000 sec.\n\nI started off by creating a loop which will run for 10 hours.  After this I created and initialised a jumped (maxJump) and a total hours (total_hours).  The next steps showed me how to use the while loop in Python.  I also used while loop to change the jumped after creating the while loop.  It is important to note that the while loop can be used for a while loop because of the conditions stated in the given problem.  I decided to use simple division for the time and also it is important to note that this was a while loop. I knew that the record was 54069.  I wanted to achieve this with maxJump = 5406 and for totalhours to be equal to total hours.\n\nAfter the first while loop ran through, I decided to run through again making sure that I do not loop infinitely otherwise one method for solving this is to find a max value and take it from there.\n\n\n### Input:\"Ronnie wants to give his mother, who is in a nursing home, the biggest present she could receive in Christmas.

{"text": "There were many steps involved in answering this question, starting with the understanding of the format of the task. The solution was then given by converting the allotted days into hours. The final step was to multiply each of these days with the number of hours in the workday that makes up 1 day. \n\n### Input - Demonstration: If the number of sick days available to any employee in the company is 14 and a minimum of 4 sick days must be used before a single vacation day can be used, how many employees are there in the company? Choices:  C: 24\nRationales: Given that a minimum of 4 days must be used before any vacation day can be accessed is given. It is further stated that the total number of sick leaves available per employee for a year is 14. Using these 2 given, it can be ascertained that each employee is entitled to 3 sick leaves and 3 vacation leaves. Therefore, total number of sick leaves would be: 3 * 24 = 72. Similarly, total number of Vacation leave would be: 3*24 =72. So, total number of sick and vacation leave is 144 in a year. Multiplying this with 8, since the duration of the workday is 8 hours. Therefore, total number sick and vacation days in a year would be: 144 * 8 =1152 days in a year. In this context, minimum 4 sick days have to be used before any vacations days can be used. So, 1152 days were divided by 4 which is 288.8 days and multiplied of each sick days allotted for each employee which amounts to 288.44 hours. Therefore the total number of sick and Vacation hour amounted to: 288 8 hours *26 = 7,784 hours.

{"text": "The question is asking about how much emily had rained last week. The answer is, 6.50 ince.\n\n### Rationales\n\nThe answer can be calculated by adding up all of the rainfall during the week. Monday and Tuesday rained 2 inches and 1 more in both days, respectively. Thus, the accumulated rainfall on Monday and Tuesday together is 3 inces, and we'll start our calculation from there.\n\nNext, Wednesday did not rain that day. But on Thursday, it rained another 1 inch. Subtracting 1 from 3 leaves a total of 2, which is what was accumulated on Wednesday and Thursday. Therefore, the accumulated rains on Wednesday and throgsday is 2 inces.\n\nNow, the biggest storm took place on Friday, with the total of 6 inches. Subtracting this from the previous total leaves an accumulated total of 4 inces. We've only gone through the first three days in our calculation. So adding 4 to 2 will give us 6, which is what Emily should use, because we've only gone through three days.\n\nHence, the daily average rain total that the week is 6.5.\n\n\n\n\n### Input\n\nCassidy wanted to determine if a ball could be broken, and how far it may go upon doing so, if it were dropped off of a platform.

The inertial theory states that the avalanche forms due to the inertia of the snow, which is caused by the gravitational force. That means that the two theories are essentially synonymous.\n### Output: Answer: In fact, I think that the probability of the inertial theory being correct can be estimated by 1/infinity. Since the ratio of their probabilities is one-to-infinity, this ratio equals zero. There are several disadvantages of the gravity-based models for the prediction of how the avalanche progresses and spreads. One such difficulty is the fact that the model does not account for the forces that can be involved in causing avalanches, such as air and water pressure.\n\n### Input (Question): What are the advantages and disadvetages of the inertial and the gravitational theories of an Avalanches?\n### Rational: \nInertia theory says that the air pressure on top of the avalanche pushes it down. \nThere are two types, non-disrupted mass, and disrupted mass.

That leaves Joy needing 164 cups 6 more feedings for her dogs, which means a total of 164.\n\nSo a summary of the math problems would say:\n5 times 3, times 77 = 147.5 times 6 = 616 times 164 = 97, 440.\n\n### Input\nJoy found the dog's diet a challenge.

{"text": "Answer the question.\n\n## Rationales:\nLet us look at each possibility.\n\n1. Option A: The whole number of a digit is not necessarily the same as the place it is found on a hundred column. This is the same as asking, \"What is the difference between nine and two?\" nine minus two = seven. So nine is different from two (or seven). Now, consider a hundred column as a place where each of the numbers is written 10 times (i.e. where a whole number is written 100 times.\n2. Option B: If ten is written in the ten's place and 2 is written in the ones place on a hundred column, then 12 can be written on the column, but it is not the same as 12. It is 20. This can be demonstrated by placing the whole numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 0 in the correct places on an expanded hundred column. Then, counting up, you will begin to see that placing whole numbers in certain positions is not necessarily the same thing as their corresponding expanded form or whole numbers.\n3.

The correct answer, therefore, would be option D: (a). This makes sense since it is the only option that states we should read the chapter first. The order we choose to view something is not restricted by a \"b, c, d, a\" framework; rather, there is a logical sequence to certain options which can help us.\n4.

Choices:  A : all marbles is a different color B : 12 marbles are a different color C : 8 marbles are a differentcolor  D : 4 marbles are a different colour  or E : some marbles are of a differen color\nRationales: A) The correct answer is A 27. Since each box can hold about 20 times the red marbles, 21 in theory, 20 green marbles and yellow can each hold about the number of yellow marbles. So the sum of 21 and 99 is 120.  Each box can hold about 7 times the blue marbles, so there are 7 in theory, making a total of 77, so each box can hold about three times as many than in a completely green box. Finally, each box can hold about two times the green marbles, meaning that there are 123 times, and 14 marbles of a different color in each box. B) Here, because \"yellow marbles make 20% of green marbles\", then the ratio is 4/3.  Since 100 marbles is what C is, so the \"green marbles\" can hold about 33 marbles, if each box has 33 marbles of that color, so the three green boxes each have about 99 marbles of that color (80/3 times 39, 126/3 times 40, 126 yellow balls in each box), 20 red marbled are in each box, so that's 20 * 3 is 60, and 3 red marble in each of those two green boxes, because 80 % is 126, and a result of that total amount of yellow marbles will become 2 * 126 = 252.

{"text": "520\n#### Reasoning: 1.First use the statement to work backwards. \nIf 1 pie out of 5 were eaten with forks, that means there is 4 in 5 pies being eaten with forks or with a spoon or fork.

The statement is: 68% of all the pies are eaten using forks.It means of course that 100% minus 68% equals 32% of  all the pies are not used forks.To find out how many percent of pies are left to eat, divide both sides by 38% until the result equals 520.

See explanation below.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. An arithmetic expression is a combination of numbers or mathematical symbols that evaluate to a numerical answer. This kind of expression can have both positive and negative integers as its input. An example of an arithmetic expression that uses negative integers is -4 + -5.\n\n2. An arithmetic expression (as opposed to an algebraic expression) in which the output is a negative integer must involve only two operands, where one of them is a negative integer. For example, 1-3 must have an arithmetical form because it does not involve any algebraic calculation, and thus must involve two operands, where only one of them is a positive integer. Therefore, only an expression that looks like 1-3 (or -4 + -5) can ever have a negative integer as its input.\n3. On the other hand, an algebraic expression (unlike an arithmetic expression) is a mathematical expression that contains terms like x, a and k in it and evaluates to a real number. And thus, the only way you can get a negative number as a result in an algebraic expression is by adding two negative numbers together. For example, the algebraic expression -a + (-1) or -(k-1) has as its output a negative number.\n4. A combination of all positive integers (which is what a positive integer means) can never yield a different combination of positive integers as output. And thus, an arithmetic expression that can only ever have zero or negative integers as input, but never a positive one, must be in algebraic form. An example is the expression 8a + 9b, where a and b are numbers that you have to substitute, and then multiply by 8 to evaluate the result. Here, no matter what the values of a and b are, the result will always be a positive integer. This is", "answer": " 15"}

Then Josh was left with 40 candies (original number \u2013 the percentage he gave away). If he only wants to consume 16 gummy bears ( 40*16/(100*4) = 16), he has 24 remaining candies left over (40 \u2013 16) that could either be shared, saved, or given away for a 25% return (24*0.25 = 6), meaning that he has 18 remaining candies (16 \u2013 6). If he is to share the 18 candies equally between his siblings and best friend (18/3 = 6 per sibling and friend). This means that he has 6 remaining candies, so if he is to share them equally to his two sibs and his best friend that leaves 1.5 gummy bears left over (6/3 = 1.5 per sibling and friend) because if he gives more to one he is giving less to the other. Then again, Josh still has a few candies left over (his original 40 gummy bears), but this can only come into play if nothing changed as a consequence of his first few actions. If Josh gave more than half and less than everything, then he has a completely different number of candies left to be shared. So in essence, Josh has 16 candies left to be eaten, 1.5 left to be shared, and 18 candies left to be kept for himself if nothing has changed (if his candy supply has increased or decreased from here, then the information has changed and there are other possible answers).\n\n### What is the best response to the above question?

We start by looking at the data provided and getting an idea of which variable has to be increased to account for the number of spots on the first floor. We can see that spots per level must be increasing. The first level had 100 spans, per the data given, but the third level gave us a higher number, showing that there were 5 more spots on level 3 than level 1.\n2. Subtracting the total of the first two levels from three, we can see that there are 9 extra spots on level 4, which were needed to account for the increase on the third level, bringing the total from 381 to 390.\n3. We can see that the spots increased steadily, as expected, but we have not taken into account the number of empty spots. A parking garage, to be properly used, needs a certain number of empty parking spots.\n\n### The question asks how many open parking spots there are in all.\n\n### When we calculate the 390 count including full and empty spots, we include the 9 extra unoccupied spots from level 3, resulting in 390 spots, which is the answer to the question.", "answer": " 186"}

Also, to travel in a straight line is easy but to stop at a certain location is a cumbersome matter.\n\nThe total time required by the ball could be calculated mathematically by the formula:\n\nNow, to find the rate, we have to find the speed which will provide us with the required result, but we are given the value of speed i.e given 5 feet per second, but what about required rate, let's call it R.\n\nWe can use inverse of speed to obtain the required rate (R) and then calculate the time required.\n\nTo do so, we could use the formula:\n\n### Solution\n\nNow", "answer": " 32"}

(100 ft x 3 ft = 33 ft), leaving a fence of 67 ft, and 335 - 67 = 268 feet\n\n### Response1 for Above Example:\nThe first question we need to answer is how much of the fence Tom Sawyer has trickned his friends into whitewaling?\n\nThe correct answer to the question, Tom Sawyer has whitewaled a total length of 400 feet.\n\n### Rationale 1: \n1. There are a lot of 4's in 3 feet, so it is clear that 3 ft is being used for 400, because of its proximity to 33 ft.\n\n2. We also know that a total of 100 ft is being whitewaled, so that leaves us a lot, which we know goes to the negative.\n\n3. This is the reason why Tom Sawyer has used 100 + (- 100) 400 ft to whitewale the entire 100 ft fence\n\n### Rationales for Response 2\n1. The second question we need to answer to is how much of the remaining fence still needs to painted.\n\n2. If we use the option 'E' we would have given up all of the remaining portion of the fence. \n\n3. Therefore we need to come up with a better option and our best bet is option 'A'\n4. 10 ft would take away 10ft from the fence (10 ft x 3ft)\n\n### Raitionale 3\n1.

{"text": "Sandra gets 2/3 * Amys share.\n\n### Input\nChoices:  A: $171 B: $25 C: $51 D: $95 E: $17\nRationales:Reasoning:  The given information can be represented in the equation S = 2/3  * A + B + C \n\n1.  Substituting the known values for Ams share and Sandra's and Amys shares, we get S = 2/24 + (2/3) * A + B + (2/3)*C so S = $17, which is incorrect.\n2. Choice E has the same sum of money, but has a different ratio. Ratio here is not what you see, since you take the sum of money equally among the 2,3,4, and 5 and divide equally the ratio among the 2, 3,and 4.\n3. Since the total sum of money is different, the value is different. Choice E is not a correct response to the question.\n4. That leaves us with Choices B, C and D. Choice B incorrectly divides Amys share only by two, and therefore yields the wrong answer.\n5. Choice C gives the correct ratio of 2:1:1, which is wrong. This does not correctly account for all the given information.\n6. The correct value is D: $25. \n7.The sum of $471 was shared in the ratio 2 : 1 : 3, so Amy gets $ (2 * 471) - ($17 * 3) = $201.\n8.

{"text": "There are 56 meters of fabric, which means there are 6 square meters per meter of fabric.\n### To each dress, 4 squares meters are needed, so each dress takes 8 square meters of fabric.\n\nThen, we apply the formula:\n\n1 Square Meter = 24 inches of Fabric.\n1 Square Foot = 9 square inches.\nSo, to make a Square Foot, it takes 9 meters x 9 square inches. Since each Square Foot takes 9 Square Inches, we multiply the Meters by 9.\n1 Square Meter = (9 x 9) Meters = 72 Square Meters = 240 Square Inches.\nThus, Each Square Foot of Fabric takes 240 Square Meters.\n\nWe know that each dress takes 8 Square Meters, and we want to  figure out how many Square Meters there are in 56 Square Meters.\nSo, we do the following.\n56 Square Meters (Total Fabric) / 8 Square Meters (Fabric for each Dress) = 7. We want 7 Dresses for every 56 Square Mets of Fabric or (56 / 7 = 8) Dresses per 56 Meters.\n\nNow that we know how to make a dress and figured out how to use our fabric, we have to figure out how many Square Feet there are in a Square Meter (4 sqaure Meters / Square Foot = 9 Square Inches).\nTherefore, there are 36 Square Feet in a Square Meter.\nWe did 56 Square Meter (Total Fabric) divided by 4 Square Meters (Fabor for each dress) = 14 Dresses\nSo 36 Square Feets times 14 equal 504 Square Feet (of Fabric).\n\n### What's 288% of 60?\n### Answer: 176.4\n### Breakdown:\n60.

The percentage  of students who are out-of-school Choices:  C: The percentage of students who physically learn at home Choices:  D: The percentage of students that learn physically at school Choices:  E: The percentage of students not present in school Choices\n\n### Rationales:\nThe percent of students present or absent in school is determined from the percent of students present and absent. The percent of students present is therefore not equal to 100% + 100% as the percent of present students plus the percent of absent students must be added to the percent of students present to obtain the percent of the students present. \n\nChoices B, D, and E do not allow for the possibility of 2 equal groups physically not in school (1/2 each). \n\nRewriting choice A, we see that the sum of the percentages of present students is found by 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 present, and therefore the solution is C: The percentage of the students physically learning at home.\nAnswer: C\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.

He spent 50 cents.\n  a. 1/8 ( 1/8 * 3) or 1/4 (3 quarters * 1/4 = 75 cents) is the amount of change left (47.5 cents). If the original amount was 70 cents, then the remaining amount is 12.5 cents.\n\nWhen he started, the amount of candy he bought was 1/8 of the amount of change left. When he finished, the amount of cents left was 1/4 of the amount of change remaining. As a result, he spent $1.00, meaning there were 13 quarters left.\n\nWe start with 70 cents because each quarter is worth 25 cents. The next part shows that he spent 50 cats.

If the number of cats in the first and second houses are the same, what is the total number of pets?\n\n### Solution:There are 47 more dogs in the second home than the first home. If the number of dogs added in both homes are the same, then the result is 47 (number of dogs of second home - number of dogs of first home = the same).\n\nThus, 47 more dogs are present in the second home. Likewise, 7 more animals are in the second home. \n\nIf the total number of animals = 107, then the number of cats of the second home is 12 (2/5*7, where 2/5 is the number of cats added in the second home, and 7 is the same of the number of dogs added).\n\nIf the number of animals in first home is 40, the number of dogs added and therefore the number of dogs in the second home, is 46 (2/5*12, 46). Thus, the total animals in the home is 94 and the total number of animals remaining when the number of cats and dogs in the second home matches the number of cats", "answer": " 66"}

{"text": "A: 1-1/2 points.\n\n### Rationale: First, let's consider how many games each team played. For the first-place team, that is 4 games.  For Joe's team, they played 3 and tied 1. Since Joe's team has more games, we will subtract that from the total number of games the first-place team had.  That difference is the result for the number of games Joe's team played, which is 2.\n\nNext, we will apply what we have to the number of points won and tied. Since the first place team won 2 games, subtract the number of points that Joe's and his team got for winning from the possible number of points they could have gotten from winning those 2 games.  That difference is what points the first place team won, which is 3-2 = 1.

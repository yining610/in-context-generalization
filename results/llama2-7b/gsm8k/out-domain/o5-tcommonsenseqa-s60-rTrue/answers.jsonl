Then, Jasper purchsed a pack of cold cut, which is more expensive than cheddar cheese and cream cheese.\n5. One pound of cold cuts cost exactly twice the amount that 1 pound of chard cheese and creme cheese cost combined.\n6. From this, we can deduce that the cost of cold cuts is 2 times the combined cost of cheese.\nThe most reasonable way to determine how much Jasper spends on ingredients is to subtract the cost of cheese from the total cost of ingredients, leaving total cost of ingredient as the answer.\n7. There are different ways to solve this problem, but this answer is the most reasonable approach because it leverages specific information about the types of ingredients and cheese.\n8.

{"text": "2.We're asked to solve for the weight of the boxer on the day of the match.\n3. There are 4 options: \na. Option b mentions '97 kg', which is the weight of the boxers on the initial date the question starts from. This isn't sufficient information to solve for the weight at the next day, a.k.a the day of the match, since it's unknown how much weight the person can lose on the next month - the answer needs an actual number and doesn't take this into account at all. In addition, it is unknown when the match itself happens - it could happen before the person has the chance to lose the first 3 kg.\nb. Option a is a little more helpful in that, it gives the amount of time between the initial day and the day of the match (4 months). However, for the weight on the initial day, the person starts at 97 kg without any extra information about how much weight he actually lost. Aside from this, the information on the weight on day is still in kg so we have no idea of the time it is being measured or calculated at.\nc. Option c is also lacking information about the time and date in which the measurement is taken. It only mentions 'before the fight but after the contest'. However, the first month can range between 31 and 32 days and the next 3 months could range between 28-30 days. In order for us to calculate the correct weight, we would need to know this specific and fixed duration that separates the day the boxer goes on the diet to the day before the match. \nd. Option d is the best option for this question since it mentions that, while the boxer is on a diet, he could still weigh '87 kg'. This number comes at about 85 days (about 23 percent of 3 months) so we have some information to play with. This means the boxer has actually lost weight even while on the diet, before he weighs in at 96 kg two weeks before the fight.

{"text": "First, we have to determine that the given information is valid and complete (i.e., that Leon is missing). \nTherefore, Leon's birth month has to be inferred in order to find his birthday. \nLeon's birthday can be inferred as April, based on the following observations: \nThe birthdays of Jolyn (February) and Therese (October) are consecutive. If Leon's birthday were January, this information would lead to a contradiction as his birthdays would be sequential but not consecutive.\nIf the birthday of Leon was December, this would imply that Aivo would be missing. Also, Jolyn and Aivo can't be in different years, else the birthdays would not be consecutive\nIf Leon was May, this would make Therese two years behind Jolyn (since Leon would be two months younger than Aivo, who in turn would be two months older than Therese)\nThus, Leon's birthday must be April, making him the missing fifth student.\n\nNow, we can find out the birthdays of the students.\nLeon is April, so his birth month is also April\nJolyn is February\nTherese is October\nAivo is May\nSo Jolyn is 6 months older than Therese and 5 months older than 6 months older than Leon\n5 months of older is the same as half a year, so Leon is 5 months older, or 6 months, younger than Jolyn\nTherefore, the question states that Jolyn is a month younger than Leon, so Jolyn is 5 months older (+3 months) than Leon\nConsequently, Jolyn is 8 months old than Leon\nSo the final answer to the question is C.", "answer": " 5"}

Hence, the distance between the start location and the destination is: D - X km  \nNow, if D is 0 km, then X = 600 km as we have calculated earlier.  \nIn general, if D is not equals to 0, we put that value in place of \"D\" and subtract it from (D - X) value as follows:  \nD - X > D - 0 > X = 60 km  \nTherefore, after sailing from one-third of the distance of their destination, they would be 60 km from their destination.  \n4) But, this doesn't take into consideration the fact that the Skipper's vessel was blown in a direction contrary to the original sailing direction, so this number is incorrect and we will need to recalculate the new distance.  \nThe Skippers' ship will be blown in a distance equal to X km, which was measured to be 600 km.  \nThe Skipped's ship started from a distance D km and had traveled a distance X km.  \nBecause the distance was measured as 600 km, the new distance can be found by adding the distance already traveled and subtracting the extra distance:  \nNew distance = (600 + D - X)  \nFrom the above equation", "answer": " 200"}

The only number we have given is $7.00.\nTherefore we need to use 0.07 as our profit number, which means that milk cost $7.00 more per carton ($3.50 + 0.07)\nWhen we are finished working with the problem, we should make sure that we are still within the percentages defined and the answer should be a number that can be expressed as a % of 70% (0.70).\nTherefore the answer should be $4.90 + 0.70 = $5.6.\nThe problem states that they must sell the same number of gallons as Sam does,\nhowever this does not include the number of gallons they can sell for $3.50.\nSince the amount they can sell gallons for $3.5 is the same, this means they can\nsell the same number of quarters as Sam does.\nTherefore, Sam can sell 50 quarts per day.

A circle is composed of points where the x and y coordinates match the radius value of the circle in its equation.  The equation can be manipulated so that the circle is written in standard form.\nThe equation for a circle in standard form is x2 + y2 = r2\nwhere x is the change in x coordinate, y is the change in y coordinate, r is the radius, and r2 is the square of the radius.  Once the circle is written in this form, there are the total number of points = n(r2) + ( n \u2212 1) (r2) + n (r2) = n(r2 + r2) + n(\u2013r2) = 2n(r2) = n \u00d7 2r(r2) = nr2(r2) = 16(r2) =nr2+16r and so the total number of points is (16, 81).

Likewise, each apple and pear would get the same treatment, getting double the original fruit amount in the end.\n10) This means that Jennifer has thirty apples, thirty oranges, and thirty pears after she distributes her fruits to the sisters.\n11) The problem given asks for the number of fruits Jennifer has left after giving her sister two of each. \n12) Therefore, the answer would be 100 -30(i.e. 100 - 30 apples, oranges, and pears) = 70 for Jennifer.\nSo the final statement would be 10(20) = 20022.\n\nInput:A man with a 3rd class honours degree in Economics was elected as an MP.

The first step is to calculate the total distance Carla's car will have to travel.\n3. The distance from the school to the soccer practice is 28 miles.\n4. So we need to add the total mileage required at each stop to calculate the total distance.\n5. 6 miles + 28 miles + 12 miles = 46 miles\n6. Carla needs to find a gas station to fill up her tank to refuel on the way to school and soccer practice, and again on the way back home from soccer practice.\n7. At a cost of $2.50 per gallon, she would have to spend $12.59 (2 gallons x $2.50) for the round trip.\n8. We can now calculate Carla's total round trip fuel cost to cover the return trip.\n9. The first trip from soccer practice back home would be 46 miles which is covered by 2 gallons. So fuel needed per trip would be (46/2) x $2.5 = $7.5.\n10. In all, Carla would need to spend $12 + $7.5 = 19.50 on fuel for the round trip to carry out the various errands.\nSo the final amount required is : \n$19.50\n\nInput: Which of these terms would be less expensive?

The question has two fractions, 41/42. This question is asking us to determine when one divided by the other will result in an integer.\n2. A quick way to determine whether a division will result in an integer is to remove the denominator first. For example, if we know that 41 divided by a smaller number (e.g., 10) will result in an integer, then we can also conclude that 41 divided 42 will result in an integer too.\n3. Thus, because 41/10 equals 4, a quick solution is 41 divided 10 will be an integer.\n4. Thus, a quick solution is that 41 divided two will be an integer. However, this doesn\u2019t tell us when it will be an integer. \n5. If 41 divided 2 will result in an even number or no number, it should result in 20 which equals 4. By elimination, 41 divided 3 equals 13 and 4 divided 3 equals 2. Therefore, 41 divided by either 13 or 2 will result in 4. \n6. 41/13 will result in 3, and 41/2 will result in 20.

This means she had made $610 from sales, and was able to meet her goal, and raise an additional $60 by splitting her funding with family and friends, which corresponds to choice D: raised an additional $60. Therefore, the conclusion follows that the trader made a profit above her goal.\nSo the final step should just be adding D: raised an additional 60 which is $616.", "answer": " 180"}

(We subtract the number of cans collected from 140).\nAdditionally, we know the amount of glass bottles is 1/5th of the total, which is 20.\nThe amount of plastic bottles could also be worked out using the same formula.\nThe amount of soda cans at the picnic could be calculated using 4*50 = 200. \nIn summary, the number of cans at the picnick could be calculated using:\nAmount of cans = 140-40-22-(1/5)*20 - 200\nTherefore, the number of can and bottles collected would be 28.\nSo the final answers are 28 cans and 20 bottles\n\nInput: How many cups of liquid are in this big vase?

{"text": "The number of customers served by all three women is a function of both the number of hours they work and the number of customers served by each one of them. The number of customers per hour is fixed.\nFirst consider the problem for Ann, Becky and Julia working for 8 full hours.  Each of them is providing a service to 7 customers in an hour.  If Ann takes a certain number of hours to complete her service, then Becky and Julia would still be able to serve the same number of customers for the rest of their time.  For the sake of simplicity, let us say there are 48 customers that day.  So Ann serves 5 (7 * 8 / 48 = 5) customers, Becky 6 and Julia 7, for a total of 18 customers served by Ann, Becky and julia.\nNext consider the scenario where Julia is working only for 6 full hours.  She still completes her service, so the service is split unequally among Ann, Becky and everyone else. This would happen if the number of customers on that day turned out to be 82.  So let's say Ann serves 9 (7 * 6 / 82 = 9) customers, Becky serves 8, and Julia has to serve everyone else.  This results in a total of 26 customers served by Ann, 24 by Becky and 32 by everyone else.\nSo let us assume that Ann, Becky and the rest worked for 12, 6 and 16 hours, respectively.

Rick has 130 total cards, 48 remaining after giving Miguel some of his cards, 120 cards given to friends, and 12 remaining cards that were given equally to his sisters.\n3. Based on the question, we can eliminate the total remaining cards, the number he kept, and the number he kept for Miguel.\n4. We know he gave his friends 120 cards.\n5. Therefore, he had 12 cards for each of his 8 friends.\n6. Subtracting these 104 cards from the total cards, we are left with 26 cards.\n7. Since we are given that each sister got 3 cards, there are 3*2=$6 cards left.\n8. There are 36 cards in total and we subtracted 26 so there should be 10 cards left to give to his two sisters.\n9. Since they each received 3 cards, this suggests that there are 30 cards left.\n10. Add this to the 104 cards already given to his friends and 5 cards for Miguel and we have 159 cards left.\n11. Now we can simply subtract this number from the total number of possible cards we were working with and the answer should fall to 26.\n12. Therefore, Rick's sisters each got 3 cards, so that leaves 26 to keep for each sister, for a total of 52 cards each.\nSo the final solution is 130 - 8*120 - 12+6=234. 3*6=18 cards for his two sisters. 234-18=216 cards still remaining. 159-216=37 cards.\n\nInput:The boy with the big head has what 3 characteristics?

If Tobias saved up the full $95 needed for a full 3 months, his total savings would be $95 x 3, or $285.\n3) Next, we focus our attention to Tobias's allowance. According to the question, he makes an allowance of $5 every month.\n4) The work component includes shoveling and mowing. For mowing, we need to look for the cost per lawn of $15.\n5) Finally, there is also an option, called \"in change\" that indicates that we don't need any more money, so we can stop there.\n6) First we evaluate the options for the savings:\nIf Tobias mowed 1 lawn in 3 months, we would need to find 15/95 to determine how many lawns were shoveled. If we find the savings to be 285, we need to find 285/15 to determine the number of lawns shoveled. This gives us 19\n7) Next, we find the number of driveways shoveled.\nSince Tobias shoveled only 19 lawns in 3 months, he can only shovel 19 driveways in 3 months. If we multiply 19 by 7 to determine the number of driveways, we get 133\nWe can eliminate two of the answer options since the total is greater than 95-5-15-19.

{"text": "The friends Paityn and Zola want to combine all of their hats together, and end up with an even number of hats. \n\n1. First, we'll need to simplify the given equation by understanding the relationship between red hats and blue hats at the start of the problem.\n2. If Paityn has a total of 20 hats and half as many red hats, that is Zola has 6 more blue hats than she starts with in total.\n3. If Paityn starts with 20 hats, and Zola starts with 24 hats, then the total number of hats must be 44, since the equation is true.\n4. There are 2 red and blue hats, making a total of 26 red hats.\n5. Therefore, there will be six blue hats left over to divide equally between both friends. 6 will go to Paityn, and Zola will get 6/24 = 3/12 of that remaining six.\nSo the final step is to multiple the answer by 12 to convert to hats.\nSo the final equation is 6 * 12 = 72\nSo the answer is 72 hats.\n\nInput: A pizza party was scheduled that would end when the pizza was eaten up or the time for the party ended.

{"text": "First, it's important is to think about how many games a team plays in a season.\n15 games are specified, which makes James play at least 15 games.\nSince each game played comprises 4 touchdowns and each touchdown is 6 points long, adding all the points to a tally will give James 6 points for each game.\nNow, let's also look at the points from the old record.\nSince the old record is 60 points, the question makes us determine how many extra points James scored as compared to the old record.\nAfter converting each touchdown to 6 points, the remaining points from the old record becomes 360.\nLet's also consider points that are scored as a result of conversions.\nEach conversion is 2 points, so adding 6 points to 360 is 366 points.\nHowever, if there are 6 touchdowns and 6 conversions, then there should be 12 touchdowns.\nIn this case, it would be 4 touchdowns + 6 conversions, giving a total of 10 points.\nAlso, since one game constitutes 15 games in a season and there are total 15 games, the number of games where James scored points should also be 15.\nAfter considering all variables, James scored a total of 12 points extra that gave him a grand total of 480 points, which is 80 more than the record total of 400.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B:80.\nSo the final score is B:80\n\nInput:What's the difference between a tiger's stripes and zebra's stripes?", "answer": " 72"}

How many more points did team X win by than team Y scored? Choices: 10 A: X 9 B: Y 8 C: X 7 D: Y 6 E: team X tied the score 6\nOutput:\n1. Here, it is given that team X beat team Y by a score 75-52.\n2. Therefore, the amount of points scored by X is 75 points\n3. Since, the total scores of both teams were equal before the game, X must have scored 52 points less.\n4. That means, points scored by X is equals to 75 +(52*2)-10, which we can write as (75-30)+(10*2)+10.\n5. The sum of these values is 197. Substituting this result in 75+41 less than 197, we can say that 197 is 52 points more than 6.\n6. Therefore 197-52=145, giving us our final answer as 145.\nSo the final A: 145\n\nInput:How many more basketball players were needed to add to team Z's lineup so they could win 52-45 (a) X 10 (b) Y 20 (c) X 5 (d) Y 1\nOutput:1.

What is the probability that Jerry plays eight games in a role and that he wins at least 2 of those games?\nOutput: 1.  It may seem that Jerrys chance to win 2 games would be 2/10 * 2/10 ~= 0.020 in eight games.  However, the options provided do not consider that Jeremy can draw either win or lose games in each of these 8 games in such a way that there is a chance. \n2. That would be considered as a fair sequence of one winning and one losing game, and therefore, the probability for the whole thing would be 0.5*0.5 ~= 0.25, which equals 25% and is not the probability of the scenario.\n3. Since the sequence of events could be anything, it makes it hard to calculate for the scenario.\n4.

Further, we want to compare the cost to pay back his dad versus just paying the amount borrowed back and not also paying him interest on the loan.\nGary spent 2 years paying off his loan, so this is the denominator. The cost he paid out in the two years is the amount borrowed, minus the monthly payment made, which is the numerator, shown in the answer section below. \nTherefore the cost/interest of the loan was $500/mo. and he didn't have to pay it because the loan was a gift.\nSo the final Answer could be :$500 - $4,000/year = $2,000/mo. or $2,00/mo. in the 2 years he borrowed the money instead of $316.6/mo he would spend on a 5 year loan.

{"text": "1) Since the number of grandchildren depend on the children that each child has, the question is asking for the sum of all the grandchildren, not for a particular child.\n2) We know that there are 8 children, each have their own number of grandchildren, and that the sum of the number of grandchildren of all the children is equal to the number of grandchildren that Max has.\n3) This suggests that the children should each have a number of grandchildren that is a multiple of 4(1, 5, 10, & etc).\n4) That way when we are asked to sum all the grandchildren, we only multiply the number of grandchildren by the number of children since both the children and the grandchildren add up to Max's number of grandchildren.\n5) This is best represented by the equation 8x + (5*2) = # of grandchildren. \n6) Since we can see that the number of grandchildren is indeed a multiple of 4, we can solve the equation where 8x is 32.\n7) We then know that Max has 32 grandchildren.\nSo the final solution is 32\n\nInput: What is a factor to consider when buying a new car? Choices: 10 A: Cost, B: Styling, C: Gas mileage, D: Features, E: Brand\nOutput: 10. Cost is the primary consideration when buying a new vehicle.\nOther important factors to consider are brand, features, gas mileage, and styling.\n2. A factor should not be discounted or omitted merely because it is not explicitly mentioned in the question.\n3. The question asks for what a prospective car buyer should consider when purchasing a car, not what the most important factor is.\n4. While styling does have an impact on overall car functionality, it does not directly affect the cost of purchasing the vehicle or subsequent operating costs.\n5. Similarly, brand is not mentioned as a necessity since it does not affect gas mileage or features.\n6. Gas mileage has an impact on operating costs, as does fuel economy, so these should be included.\n7. Features can depend on the purchasing price, which is part of the cost.\n8.

{"text": "Answer: Harry earns $45 in each week he walks dogs.\n1. We begin by writing the numbers that represent the 7, 12, and 9 dogs as multiples of 7. These numbers will represent times or the total amount of dogs that Harry walks on that particular day. \n2. We can express the amount of money that Harry earns each day by dividing the pay that he gets for each dog walk by the total number of dogs that he walks each day. \n    The expression for the amount of money that he earns each day becomes (5/7) x 7 for each day that he walks 7 dogs, and (5 x 12)/12 for each day he walks 13 dogs and (5 x 9)/9 for each day that he only walks 9 dogs \n3. To figure out the total amount of money that Harry collects in a week, we can multiply the monetary amounts that Harry collects each day by the number of times that he walks each dog during the week.\n    We do this because each dog gets walked by Harry on a different schedule during the week. \n  Thus the amount of money that Mr. Harry earns each week is the product of all multiples of the amount he earns each day. This product simplifies to: (7 x 4)/21.  (7 times 4 over 21) is the same as 4/21.  Hence Harry earns $4/21 each week or $45 in the first, second, and third weeks, but only $28.57 each week during the fourth, fifth, and sixth weeks.\n4. The correct solution is that Harry walks dogs each week of the year, 7 days a week, and gets $45 for each week of each year. \n5. But, Harry wants the total amount of money he should get in the event that he works all year long. This happens in one year.\n6. The total money that Harry earns (all year long) is: 1 x (7 x 4/) /21 = $45,476. \nSo the final answer  is $45,460\n\nInput:The number was divisible by 8. And then it was divisible by 12.

{"text": "1. We can use two equations to help us to solve this problem. \nThe first equation is Time = Distance/Speed, which states that the time it takes to travel a distance is directly proportional to the speed one is travelling at. \nThe second equation is Distance = Speed * Time, which is the formula for calculating how much distance an object travels as a function of time and speed.\nBy replacing the variables in the first equation, we get: Time for travelling 2 hours = Distance/Speed. Inserting the value of the second equation, we get: Distance for travelling 2 miles in 2 hours = Speed/2, or 32 miles.\nInserting the value of Speed into this equation, we get a Speed of 32 miles / 2 hours = 16 miles per hour.\nHence, Tom covered 736 miles. \nTherefore the closest option to the answer is \"B\" which is 736.\nSo the final number is B: 736", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "First, we have to find out how many bales of Hay each acres of grass can produce.\nWe can do that by finding the number of bales of Hay per acres of grass in the hay farmer's field last year. \nIf 5 acres produced 560 bails (bales of grass) then (by division) each acres of grass will produce 560/5 = 112 bales of grass.\nThen, multiply the bales of grass (112) * 7 acres and this will yield the answer (774 bales of grass per month).\nNext, we have to get the bales of grass per day (3) to give us the number of bales per day.\nThen, multiply by the number of days in a month (30) to find the bales of grass that a day will give us.\n\nThat number yields 92 bales of hay.\nTherefore, each horse eats 92 bales so if we start feeding these horses at the beginning of September each horse will eat 47( 92/2) bales of hay on average per month.\n\nIf the farmer feeds 560 bale of hay per month last year then (logically) he used the same amount last year (560 bales per month).\nHe will only consume 560 baled of hay for this year in November and December.\nIf we have 560 bail of hay we don't get an extra 92 bales to use for the horses.\n\nTherefore, bale of hay will last each horse till end of December.\n\nIf we subtract the number of bales that are used in Nov and Dec this leaves us with 120 bales of hay left around mid December.\n\nSo each horse that's left will have 120 bale of hay.\nThese bale of hay are not fed to the horses anymore when the grass is depleted.\nTherefore, there will be no bale of hay after the end of December.\nTherefore, the final answer is E: bales of hay will deplete in mid-December.\n\nInput: Which part of a pizza costs the most money?

Choices:  Prepare dinner B: Eat Dinner C: Work in school E: Sleep\nOutput: The astronaut lives in the space exploration vessel for 26 months or 2.25 years without a break. \nThe astronaut is on their way to Mars for 2 years. So on the spaceship for 26 months, they have to plan out their daily schedule for that entire period.\nIn order to stay healthy and perform their work optimally, the astronaut should be well rested. \nSleeping would be the most important activity to perform on this trip.\n\nOther choices mentioned are not as important as sleeping. They may be performed only if the astronaut does not sleep.\nPrepare dinner and eat dinner are not important and can also be done in case of no sleep.\nWork in school, though important, could be done only if there is no other work to be done and sleep is available.\nEven if the astronaut stays up all night, they still need to sleep for eight hours because it has been scientifically proven that humans need approximately 8 hours of sleep.\n\nThe astronaut might be able to sleep anytime. So anytime after waking up the astronaut can rest but not during work hours.\nSleeping should be done at around 8 PM because any later will be unhealthy as the circadian rhythm takes a longer time on the way to Mars.\n\nAs a result, the most important thing for the astronaut to perform is Sleep.", "answer": " 259200"}

{"text": "First, we should consider how John pays for the cost.  Based on the given facts, it is stated that John pays for half the cost.  That tells us that the entire cost is at least $20,000 per year.  Also, it is mentioned that it is for \"8 years and then twice [that] much per year until the [child] is 18.\"  That tells us that it is for 8 years and then 1.5 times the cost for each of the next 10 years. Since we can't multiply 20,001 by 1.5 to get exactly 20,025, we should take the simpler path and assume that John pays for 25% of the child's cost.  Additionally, 25% of 20,016 is 5,004.  John is also stated to pay for twice that cost, so 10,008. Therefore, the total cost is $10,013.20.\n\nWhen it comes to the University tuition:\n$1,250,021 - $10,020 = $1,249,999.  The child will then go to College (university).  There is a $250,250 tuition for university.  20% of 250,248 is $50,051.  The 20% is John's share (after tuition is subsidized by a 50% scholarship).  This means that John pays $50,005.  Finally, $10,063.20 - $50,031 = $9,033.20. \n\nJohn's total share of the initial child costs (including college) is $9,032.42 in 2021 and $13,058.80 in 2026.\n\n\nInput:Who are the most hated animals?Choices:  A: Raccoons B: Bats C: Skunks D: Snakes E: Turtles\nOutput:1.

{"text": "First, we need to establish the formula for solving a rate-limited problem.\nRate-limited = (D * P) * T /(R * D * P) where:\nD stands for Days\nP stands for Payment\nT stands for Time\nR stands for Rate\nIn this equation, P represents the monetary unit in the rate-limited problem.  \nFor example, if P=20 then D=$100\nThen the answer is (R*D*(T/R))*(P/R)^(1/D)\nHere, the unit P = 2 and all others are 1, so D=4\nFirst, we can find (R*D*(2/R))*(2/R)^(1/(4*4)) = 4*2*4*2/4 = 32/4 = 8\nIn the formula, 2/R represents the amount of money earned per pound in lingonberries, and (2/R)^(4) represents the number of berries one must pick to make $2 on Monday. \nThe next step is to subtract the amount earned on Monday from the required amount, so $2 subtracted by our answer at line 2 is $0, or that is, no lingonberries were picked on Tuesday.\nNow, with information for Monday and Tuesday, we can apply the formula a second time to determine how many berries were needed on Wednesday. \nWhen using the formula with the values provided, the result appears to be 12 pounds. \nThe question states that Steve decided to rest on Wednesday, so 12 is too many. \nFrom this information, you can conclude that Steve earned $2 on Monday and nothing on Tuesday. \nHe is out of berries and decided to rest, so he must have earned $16 on Wednesday.\nFurther calculation shows that Steve must have picked 10 pounds of lingonberies to earn $16 on Wednsedy.\nIn total, Steve picked 8 + 32 +16 + 12 = 70 pounds of lingonberrys to make the $100 he was after.\nTherefore, the final answer is D=70\nWhit a total count of berries picked 32 on Monday, 1", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "Diane bought twenty more applies than Cecile. If she bought 15 applpes, how many apples dianne did they buy altogether? Answer: Choices:  A+B=C B=15\n\nOutput: One way to solve the question is to subtract the number of apples Cecile bought from the number of apples Diane bought. Since we know that Diane bought 20 more apples than Cecile, and that Cecile bought 14 apples, the difference is 36. Therefore, Diane bought 36 more apples than Ceceil. This is equal to the number of apples, C. Therefore, C is equal to 36.\n\nInput: What is 3+3\nOutput: The question asks for the answer to the mathematical equation 3+3. \nIn simplifying this equation, 6 is the desired answer. \nThe correct answer, in order to answer the question, should be A: 6", "answer": " 50"}

Next she created a 2-foot base for her igloo. That's another 20 bricks. Her igloo is two-feet at the base so she added another 20 brick of snow in the middle of her igloo. The igloo is now 5 feet wide at the ground but only 3 feet tall, so she added 8 more bricks. That's 48 bricks. \nNow a 4-foot-tall igloo would have 48 bricks of snow. But, Libby decided her igloo should be 4 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and four feet tall. To do this she added one last row of bricks that was four feet tall. But, because rows are laid one on top of another, she could have continued building the same row of bricks that she just laid. Adding the one row on top was extra snow. She then added a 2-foot cap on top of her igloo, which is the same number of bricks as her 2-foot base.\nThere are now 20 rows down and 10 rows up. If Libby used three bricks wide for each layer, she added a total of 20*3*10 which is 60 bricks more. There are now a total of 120 bricks of snow. \nSo she used 12 more bricks of snow in both the 4-foot-wide row and the 2-foot-wide row.\nSo 120 = 12 + (20 * 10).\n120 bricks + (20*10) - 20 = 140 bricks.\n\nInput:There is a pothole in the middle of the road.

First divide one pound by 5 to determine that Harris would feed one carrot in 5 days.  Divide 365 by 5 to determine the days in a one year.  Multiply these numbers together to find that Harris would feed his dog 73 carrots that year.  This means he would need to buy 73 bags over a year.  Divide the cost of the bags by 73 to get an idea of how much each bag of carrots costs over one year.  This gives Harris an idea of how much money he should put aside for carrots he purchases.\nSo the final amount Harris will spend on carrots in a year is $47.62.\nTherefore, the correct answer is $47.\nSo the final number is $47.", "answer": " 146"}

The first way is to divide the whole list into individual lines and calculate the cost for each line, sum it up to get total, then multiple by tax.\n2. But this will take a long time, as you'd have to add up the number of samosas and pakoras as well. A simpler way to do is to just do the multiplication in a table with the quantity and total and multiply that by the tax.\n3. This will require fewer calculations and will take less time.\n4. The table with the quantities of goods purchased and the prices can be formed thus:\n\n    Qty Price   = $\n   [ 1 Samosa] $2\n   [ 1 Pakora] $2\n   +  [ 2 Samosas] $4\n   +  [2 Pakoras] $6\n   +  [3 Pakoras] $9\n   +  +  [4 Pakoras] $12\n   +  + + [5 Pakoras] $20\n5.

{"text": "The amount of time required to complete a load of laundry can be calculated using the formula Time = 1/C * 60. Where Time is the amount of time taken in minutes, C is the cycle speed in minutes per load.\n1. Since the amount of time required to wash all the laundry is equal to the sum of washing time of each load, therefore the formula for washing cycle can be: T = 1/t * 60 where T is the number of wash cycles, t is the cycle time, and 60 is number of minutes in hour.\n2. Similarly,the formula for drying cycle is T = 1/d * 60 where d is the cycle time in minutes, T is the number of dry cycles, and 60 represents number of minutes in an hour.\n3. From the provided information, the calculation for cycle time can be:\nt = (W * 45)/N and d = (D * 60)/N\nwhere t is the time for washing cycle, W is the volume of wash load, N is the number of washing cycles, d is the time for drying cycle, N is the number dry cycles, and D is the drying time in minutes.\n4. Substituting these values in, the cycle time of washing and drying cycle can be, respectively:\nt = (1.29 * 17050)/8 and d = (68.75 * 60/365) and W = 200000\n5. Therefore, the cycle time for washing is 50 minutes and the cycle time for drying is 13 minutes. \n6. Combining both the results, the value of number of dry cycles required will be equal to the value of number of wash cycles 8.78.\n7. The time required to complete the laundry can be written as 8.78 * 13 minutes.\n8.

{"text": "Ludwig works seven days a week, but there's a difference between the number of weeks he works in a year and the total number of days he works in a year.\n1. Ludwig works 4 days a week, every week. This means he works 50% on every day between Monday and Thursday (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).\n2. If we assign different values to Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sundays, the math will work.\n3. Let's assume Thursday equates to 50% of a weekly income. The daily salary, S, will be S/7, for every day in the week.\n4. It's known that Ludwig gets to work during Saturday with half of his usual salary, so his daily salary on Saturday is S/2.\n5. The salary received on Thursday, Friday and Saturday will be the same value as half of S, so it will be (1/2)(S) for every day.\n6. Let Thursday be the starting day. (1/2)(5S) = (1/2) x (5 x S/7) = S/7. So, Thursday equals the value of S/7. This result is the same for all 4 days.\n7. Therefore, 5/7 = S/7, so S = 7S/5.\n8. So Sunday is the day that Ludwig works for 100% of the weekly salary.\n9. Therefore Sunday = S/7.\n10. Now the remaining 4/7 = S/5. Therefore, Ludwig works with normal salary during the remaining work days.\n11. The total weekly salary of Ludwig is (1/2)(4S)/7 + (1/2)(1S)/7 + (S/4).\n12.

Ariella's savings account earns 10% simple interest, so on her contribution, she will earn $2 each year.\n3. Therefore, Ariella puts $160 every year in her son's account.\n4. Combining this with the fact that Ariella has $20 more than Daniella, the yearly balance of Arielle's account is $48 less than Daniella's account.\n5. However, if the money stays in both accounts for one year, then there is no additional money in Ariella's account.\n6. Therefore, after one year, Ariella does not have more or less in her son's accounts than Daniella.\n7. However, two years later, Ariella will have $360 in her son's bank account.\n8.

In the second case, Ariella'a son's account will have $540 balance after two years and her initial contribution was $160, while Daniela's account had a balance of $480 a year ago.

If Bekah read 22.6 and her assignment required 113 days and 231 pages, then she needs to read 55 22.6 = 136 pages to make up in one month.\n11. The final question asks how many pages she needs each day to make up the days she missed. To do this, we need to divide 136 by the number of days she had to read for the assignment.\n12. If she had 55 days to make up for, then she needs to cover 55 136 = 7.4 pages to make up for each day.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 35 and the final answer is 7.4.\n\n\nSo the final answer to the first question is 7.4 and the final answer to the second question is 22.6\n\nInput:The two numbers are 4 and 9.

One can add up the revenue he has made in the past, which is $(4*4+2*5)??, and then find out what amount he needs to make to cover the new set goal and subtract that from the total revenue made.\n6. This would take a while and a lot of steps, however.\n7. It is better to understand what he has done so far and look for hints in the given information to simplify this math problem.\nFor simplicity, lets assume that the price of a brownie and a lemon square is $1 each.\n8. Now it should be very obvious how many brownie and how many lemon squares Jack has sold so far.\n9. From what were given, its $3 for 4 brownies and $2 for 5 lemon squares.\n10. From this, we can say that he has sold 4*4+(5*5) brownies and lemon squares so far. This is equivalent to\n4*4+25, or 4*4+20(4=5). This is $3*20+20$= $100.\n11. We can say that Jack has sold $100 worth of cookies and he wants to make $50 more. Therefore, he has to sell $22*25-100= 22*25+50 cookies.\n12. Since 25*(25-10+22) is 22, this means that he has to sell [22*25(25?10??)] which in the simpler terms is equal to 22*2*25.\n13. This is equal to 550 cookies.\n\nSo the final answer should be 550\n\n\n1. When a teacher asks for work besides just showing work, there are a few things she can be looking for.\n2.

Choices: \nA: the birthday celebration spent dining with a special person, even if you're eating ramen noodles B: taking advantage of a once in a lifetime opportunity to celebrate one's birthday, no matter where the celebration takes you C: a relaxing environment that fosters peacefulness and calm D: spending time with a friend E: a party with a lot of people F: no special occasion, rather just a gathering of some people\nOutput: \n1. The way the question is phrased gives hints to the options available.\n2. All of the options are valid events, but some are not likely on a particular birthday or not the celebrant's choice.\n3. The party at a neighbor'\ns house, while somewhat appropriate for a birthday celebration, is not the only thing a birthday girl can do when celebrating.\n4. Further, there seems to be an underlying suggestion that the birthday girl might not be thrilled or excited about the party her neighbor has planned.\n5. Therefore, the birthday girl might be more likely to forgo the party to hang out with a friend instead, but only if it's a party she does not particularly prefer.\n6. The celebration on the beach might not be preferable if the weather is colder or the person does not like to be on the beach all day, but if it's a nice day that the birthday girl enjoys, then the beach may be the better choice.\n7.

{"text": "Firstly, it's important that we make a note of which way the variables being used (Karen's tote and Kevin's briefcase) are changing over the course of the problem. \nKaren's totem, according to the statement, is only described as being empty. In order to change the tote's weight, we would have to add something to it, which is what Kevin does. \nKevin's briefcase, however, goes through the same process with both its weight and its contents being described, which can change. \nWe need to determine how much Kevin's briefcase weighs when it's empty and find the difference between the weight of his briefcase being empty and how much lighter it becomes when Karl finally adds in the work papers.\nOnce we've done that, we can subtract those weights from each other to find the difference in weight between the tote and the briefcase.\n1. When Karen's tote is empty, it weighs 8 lb so that's what we'll call the base case scenario where it is just Karen's totem.\n2. Once we add in Kevin's briefcase, the weight now doubles, so the weight of the briefcase when it only has Kevin as the owner is double that same number.\n3. We have established that the work papers weigh 1/6th as much as the briefcase, then they have to weigh 1/12th the amount as the briefcase, which is 1/3rd.\n4. This is all assuming that Karen's toto has the same weight to all, but if that were not the case, it still wouldn't alter the logic too much because we can change the base weights.\n5. So from this information, we can establish that Kevin's briefcase must weigh 6 lb without the papers and be 12 lb when the papers are added. \n6. We can establish these numbers because when Kevin adds just one pound to that, the briefcase becomes twice the weight of the tote, but in both cases, as long as it's only 1 lb difference.\n7.

This could be one or several days or periods.\n1. In the given statement, the days referred to are the consecutive three days in a row.\n2. For any given day, the first day was used as a point of reference to compare the number of buyers. From comparing the buyer numbers for the first 3 days, it can be seen that there are 40 more people in the grocery on Day 3, compared to Day 2. Also, there are half less people in Day 3 compared to Day 2 and another half less compared to Day 1.\n3. Therefore, the only way there could be an increase of 40 buyers in Day 3 from Day 2 and still have a total number of buyers equal to half of the number in Day 2 is if there were the same number of buyers on Day 1 as Day 2.\n4. This can be represented through the following:\n  \n    n-2|\n     0|\n     0|---D2|---D3|---D1|---E\n   n/2 = D2 = D3 = D1  \n 5.

Shelf inside the basement - as for the bathroom window, many people hide there. There is a high chance of being found by the seeker, as the seeker will either walk up to the door and discover the hidden.\n3. Windowsill of a closet - this may be a place to hide, but it will make getting out of the closet and opening the door more difficult, and thus harder to find.\n4. A bathroom - as in the previous cases, the most likely place that seeker would look for you would be where they are likely to seek or if they find you you will likely be unable to move away while the seeker looks.\n5.

He needs to jog 40 laps a day.\n\n 40 laps times 1 laps per day= 40 laps\n\n40 laps times  1 laps per day =  40 laps daily\n\nWhat is ( 40 laps / 1 laps per  ( 40 lap s / 1 laps/day)/  ( 40 lap s /  1 lap/day)\n\n5)  The average calories burned per hour is:\n\n500 calories / 5 days = 100 calories / day\n\nWhat is:\n\n100 calories/  hour =   100 calories per hour\n\nWhat is: 100 calorie per hour divided by 25 calories per foot = 4 calories per foot\n\nWhat is:   2 calories per foot times 40 laps =    80 calories burned per day\n\n6) In any case, to burn off 10,000 calories Ian needs to jog for:\n\n10,00 calories /  40 lap s = 250 laps\n\n7) Our solution is for a hypothetical example where Ian jogged enough to burn a whopping 10,011 calories.  Note that if he kept jogging, he'd have very little chance of ever reaching this number.  It's probably better to stop jogging after he burns off", "answer": " 100"}

As a result, the price went down to $150.\n2. Donna paid 10% Sales tax. As a result of this, the price increased by 10%.\nTo know how much Donna paid, we have to first know how much the vase was after the discounts.\nThe vase price decreased by 25%.\nTherefore, the price of the vase before tax was $150.

{"text": "The options provided cannot provide the correct answer. \nTo compute the answer, this question requires us to analyze 5 years of age growth for Djibo, and his sister.\nAdding Djibo's current age 17 with 5 would give his age 6 years from now, i.e. 23.\nIf Djibo adds his sister's total estimated age with his age, it would have to be greater than his age (as he will be older than his sister).\nHence, adding Djibo's 5-year-ago age 12 to his current age with 23 could result in 35.\nAs a result, when five years had passed, Djibo was 17 years old and his sister, 8 years old.\nTherefore, Djibo's age 5 years ago was 12, which his sister's age will now be 13 years, 8 months, which is 9\u00bd years at 23 years.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 9\u00bd years.\nSo the final answers is 12 + 5(23) to 9\u00bd years (26-29/2) \n\n## Instruction:Answer the next 10 grade grade math questions", "answer": " 28"}

Choices: 1. Tickle A: Tickle B: Slapping C: Stomping D: Sprinting E: Screaming\nOutput: By asking for something that will cause a chain reaction, the options are limited to activities that involve physically interacting or impacting another person. \nAll 5 options are individual activities, but only the first three have interactions between people that could potentially lead to a chain reaction. \nActivities that impact an inanimate object will not cause a chain reaction.  Therefore, the only options that could cause a chain reaction are A: Tickle, B: Slapping, and C: Stomping. \nThe only way someone could be slapped is with physical interaction, either directly, or indirectly through an intervening medium (like a pillow). \nTherefore, this leads to the logical conclusion that the correct answer is A: Tickle.\nSo the final choice is 2 + 3 = 2.\n\nInput: Where do your feet touch down on a staircase?\nChoices: 1.

The main question is how many each person will have. \nFrom the given numbers, we know that Jessie made \"20 muffins\" in total. \nAs a mathematician, we might want to skip to any simple equations right away, like 4x20 and 2x20, but we need to make sure the problem gives us all information.\n8. In this case, we know the number of muffins, but we do not know how many muffins Jessie had to give the guests.\n\n9. To figure out the remaining information, the first thing that comes to mind is that we can easily divide 20 by 4, giving us 5.\n\n10. The next thing to note is that it says Jessie made 20 mufins and divided them between four person.\n\n11. In short the total number of muffins was 20, which were divided between four people, Jessie and her friends.\n\n12. In summary, Jessie had to make 5 muffins for herself and four muffins for her friends.\n\nBy subtracting 5 muffin from 40 muffin, we know that they had five muffins for themselves, and four muffins left for her friends. \nThe number of muffins Jessie gives to each friend and how much each will get from the muffins are what matter in this context, given that 20 muffin made.\n\n13.

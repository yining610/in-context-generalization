So at least Mina remembered 6 digits. 4thly, Now it is clear that Sam and Mina both have at least 6 digits. Sam has 6 more than Carlos. At this point, we can safely assume that Sam has 18 digits. 5thly, So far, we know that Sam memorized at least 6 more digits than Carlos. So, Sam has at least 6 more than at least 6 and the one digit from Carlos, hence Sam has at least 17 digits. 6thly, It can be concluded that the answer options range in between 15 to 19 digits.\n\nOutput : 7thly we note that Mina memorized six as many as as Carlos memorized, so she has at least 6 digits and Sam has at least 8 digits of pi.

Therefore, 4+4+16 gives us 24, that there are 24 hours total spent in practice sessions.\n4) However, since their practice sessions last 4 hours, we know that the games must last for 2 hours each to still result in the practice sessions being 24 hours total.\n5) So to find the time spent by his daughters at the field just playing, we need to subtract 24 from 32 (i.e. 16 from 24).

{"text": "1. The first step is to determine the total number of photos they took on the first and second days. To do this, we can use the formula:\n(Day 1 Photos) + (Day 2 Photos) = Total Photos\nBased on the given information, the Day 1 Photos are (2xHalf as many) or 2*(1/2)=100Photos\nAnd the Day 2 Photos are 120\n\n2. Putting it into the formula: (100 + 120=) Total Photos = 220\n3. Next, we want to find the total number of photos that Lilah's family took before the trip, which we will call Day 0. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of photos they took over the course of their 2-day trip from the total number of photos (220 in this case). In this case, the number of photos they did NOT take on the trip is 100 + 20 = 120\n4. We can put this into a formula to determine the total number before the trip. The formula is: Photos before trip = Total Number - Trips number\nIn this case it is: Photos before = 220 - 120:\n\n5. = 100 Photos.\n6. Putting this into the question, the photos before the trip = 100.\n7. The total number of photos in Lilah's family's gallery after their trip can be calculated by adding the total number of photos from the first two days + number of photos taken before the trip: Total = Photos from trip + Photos before trip\nin this case total = 220 + 100 = 320\n8. Finally, we can substitute all the values into the formula to get the answer to the question:\n= (100+120+100)=320\nSo the final answer to this part is 320\n\n### End the grade math quiz", "answer": " 920"}

Now that we have identified the original price of the newspaper, we will find our answer by subtracting the 1-year subscription cost from the original price. Using what we just discussed, we can calculate the discount by taking the $150 original price and multiplying it by 0.55.

The increase in speed has no effect on the total number of vibrations experienced(vibrations experienced would be the same for any given period of time(say 5 minutes) and frequency of vibrations(say, 1600 to 1740), in this example, because the motor only works on 60% faster setting) as a massager.\n3. 1 + 0.01 = 0.01 + (1 / 60) = 60.20 / 60 + 1 = 1 or simply rounded up to 1.

Next, we take 8 robots, which is the total number of friends, and divide it by 7 with remainder 0 to get the quantity of each friend.\n3. The quantity of each friend here is 8.725. Since this quantity is less than the number of friends, we need to round up. Since it rounds up to 8.75, we have 8 robots for a total price of $69.60 for a total cost of $76.67.\n4. Then we subtract the amount he pays to a cashier.\n5. So, we are left with $116.42. Since the question states that he was left with $11-53 in change, we can multiply by 11. \n6.

C: at least 165\n4. D: at least 50\n5. E: at least 120\nOutput: 1.) The question starts by telling us that we are already 150 miles away from our destinations based on a road trip with an expected mileage of 285.\n2.) That means we need to include the first exit, not subtract from the total or add to the distance.\n3.) The road trip was 280+ miles, but 150+275 = 425+150 = 575.\n4.) We can subtract 150 from 575 to go 425 miles, so the amount we need to go is 165.\n5.) We can subtract the 1st exit from 150, to end at 135 and add 275 to 135 to get to 410.

Based on the information given, we can understand that 'John gets a bonus that\u2019s the same percentage every'. Also, it is 'the same percentage every' means that it is not likely to vary from year to year.\n\n2. The next question is to determine how much he made last year. 'Last year he made $1,0,000,00' means that his total income last year included a bonus of $10,0,00' and he made something else other than the bonus, his total income for the year including his bonus was $100, 0,00 and the same would likely apply for the subsequent years.\n3. Since John is getting the same percentage every year,  his bonus last year was a percentage of his total income and his bonus was the same percentage, so is the case for this year as well. Therefore, 'John gets a bonus the same percentage every year means that:\nHis bonus in last year was 10% of his total pay.\nHis bonus in this year is 10% of 2,0,0,0, which is $200, 00 (since it is 10% last year too). So, both his total pay and his bonus is $220,00 this year.\n4. Now that we have established that both last year and this year's situation was the same, it is possible to calculate what he will make this year when adding his total pay and his $220, 00 bonus. \n5.

{"text": "1) To answer this question and figure out the solution, we first need to simplify the problem.  \n  The formula is the amount of money made multiplied by the number of hours worked. In this scenario, Sam made $456*23$ to work for 23 hours. However, in the remaining three months,Sam made $460*8$ which translates to $352*8$ =340 and the expense of the repair. He now needs to earn that amount more than the amount his car repair cost \n2. So, we start by multiplying 340 by the number of hours. (We start with 340 to take into account the amount of money he earned before the car repair). The solution will be the number of hours Sam needs to work to earn 352*8. We need to get rid of the 340 and keep the 52 and 8. The amount of money Sam made does not include the repair, so we get to take what we made from the repair to reduce what we do not take from the repair and that is 340. \n3. Hence, we start with $352x(23+$8)$ to get the total amount. We work backwards to determine the amount Sam is earning hourly. Now, Sam can work for 23.24 hours and earn enough to buy the video game console. We do 352/50= 7x (23.24 +8) =44.8 hrs\n4. So, Sam needs to work 81 hours more to buy the video game Console.

After the third purchase: \".. and she now has 70kg of dog food.\"\n4.) Now let us determine how many kgs remained after Elise made 3 purchases.\n5.) Since, after Elise's first purchase of 15kg + 10kg = 45kg, her total number of kgs increased to 45 from 15 by five kgs. Then after Elise's second purchase of 10kg + 10 = 20kgs, the updated total was \"45 + 20 = 65 kgs.\" and after the third purchase of 15 + 10 =25 kgs, the new total value became \"65 + 25 = 90 kgs.\"\n6.) Therefore, Elise's total number of kg, including the ones she initially possessed and the ones she obtained by purchasing 3 times, equals to \"90-15-10+15 = 40 kgs.\"\n7.) So 1.)

The remainder is the amount of food that her lunch contained and that she did not eat. \n7.

{"text": "1st step: The question tells us that for the first hour, she picks 60 apples. It also tells us that for the second hour, she doubled her picking rate - which means that if you look at just the first hour, you could imagine if she had doubled her rate for all three hours, how many apples she would have picked. So for the first hour she picks the equivalent of 60 apples, 3 times, so it is 180 apples total. (This is because to get to 60 apples in one hour, you first pick 20 apples, then once you double your rate per hour, that becomes 20 again (so 20*2=40), then once you double it again, that is 40 again (so 40*2=80), and finally, you've reached the 1 hour threshold (2hr*40=80, then 3hr*80=240, 240+240=480, which is the equivalent of 180 appples picked for the first hour).)\n2nd step: For the 2nd step, the question tells us she doubles her picking rate in the second hour. That means the first hour's apples, which is 180, becomes doubled for each of the remaining hours. So for the 2nd hour, instead of picking 2*40 equaling 80 apples, each step of 20 becomes 40 apples. So we end up with 3*40=120 apples. \n3rd step: And in the 3rd hour, we are told that we could take the first hour of apples picked and cut them in half. So 180 appiles becomes 180/3=60. This is so that we end up with 60*1=60 apples for the 3rd hour as well. This is because for the first hour Kylie picks 60 and for the third hour Kylie pickes 60.\nSo, in total, Kylie picks a total of 180+120+60=400 apples total.\nSo the final answewr is E: 4", "answer": " 220"}

However, for clarification purposes, this contest focuses on the heaviest pumpkin.\n4) The question asks about the difference between the heavies and lightest pumpkins in pounds. The correct answer is supposed to be calculated as follows: the difference in their weights i.e. 54 minus 27 = 27. The answer is (27/1). And the difference is 27.0/1 = 27, then we get the answer 27.0 pounds.\nSo the final answeer is 27.\n\nInput: At the start of the movie, the lead character was trying to get to a meeting.

This is because this sequence is the letter sum of all the 5 digits.\n2) Now that we know that the total amount of the stock pile of al these squirrels for the period of 40 days is 100, we can find the percentage allocation of each squirrel.\n3) Each squirrel stock piles 100/5=20 nuts each day. So, the percentage allocation of each 100 nuts across the 5 squirrels is 20/5. Thus, the total amount of n=2+6 nuts that goes to each squirrel is 5*20/5=24. If we assume that squirrels do not move around from one car to another, then each squirrel is equally distributing his/ her time on every day of the week. So, each squirrel on each day  would have 1% of the stock pile. If each squirrel stores his/her nuts into 1% of the car\u2019s stock pile, then it will be 5% of the total nuts that are stored in the car.\n4) To find the total nuts, we add the totals of the squirrels.

{"text": "1.. We can directly see that the oldest sister is Marcia (she is twice as old as Jan).\n2. To calculate the age of the younger sister Cindy we will take all the information above, since we know the oldest sister and her age, we will do the following: Let the ages of Marcia = M, Jan= J and Cindy=C. Also, the difference between the oldest sister and the younger ones will be (M-J)+(M-C)=M+J+C.\n3. Now we can determine the age of C and J by solving the equation.\n4. We get: J = 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 years old\n5. C can be easily calculated knowing that J is 9 and M is twice as older as J, then J = (M-J)+M=2M=2 x 9 ==>C = 18 years old.\n6. Greg's age can be calculated directly knowing that C and J's ages are already known. \n7. Greg's age = 2J+C, we know M = 2 x J, so M \u2013 J is 2, and we also know J-C = 2. So 2 C + 2 (J \u2013 C) = M so (2C + 4C) = 2 (M - (J - C)) ==> 6 + 4C = 2(M-2C) ==> (8C)/2 = 2M\u20134C ==>C = (8M)/16 = 2M/4 = 4M/8 ==> Greg's age = M-2C. \n8. We now have that the age of Marcia = M = 8, the age of J = 9, and the age of C = 32.\n9.

However, they do contain dairy, sugar, and vegetable-based products such as nuts, chocolate chips, and oats. \n3. Similarly, vegetarians avoid seafood too, as it is not regarded by them as a food they can eat. Thus, option G: seafood can be eliminated.\n4.

To find out how many cups of water, cups of flour and teaspoons are in the pizza, we take the following equation and simplify it as much as possible:\n6. We solve for t to find:\n7. So there are 15 cups of water, or 30 teaspoons of water, 33 cups of flour (16 X 2 3/4) and 7 cups of salt, which equals 105.5 teaspoons or 7 cups of teaspoons.\n8. Therefore the answer is 15, 33, and 7\nSo the final answer should be: 15, 53, and 7 cups.", "answer": " 34"}

{"text": "1. Right away, it is evident that Rachel must spend at least double what Sara spends in order to meet this budgeting requirement.\n2. Therefore, to solve this problem, we need to work backwards by multiplying the difference (Sara's budget- Rachel's budget) by 2 to get the required funds: $50 x 2 = $100\n3. Rachel must allocate $100, or more, to get both shoes and dresses for her, as her budget is $200.\n4. There are 2 options available for the shoes: to either spend $50 on 2 pairs or to spend $100 on one pair only.\n5. Let us make the assumption that the first option, i.e., $50 on 1 pair, results in the shoes being bought (in reality, it is uncertain that Sara bought two pairs of shoes with this budget)\n6. The next step is to calculate what should be the remaining budget for Sara in order to buy only one pair of shoes. This can be done from the question.\n7. We find that the remaining budget for S has to be $95. This means that Rachel must spend an additional $35 to reach the target budget of $100. But, Sara has already spent $200, which meets the requirement of $100 she had to allocate to her shoes and dresses - which means Sara had to spend at least double of what Rachel's required budget was.\n8. In other words, if Sara spent double than Rachel's requirement, Rachel should spend $50 on each pair of shoes.\n9. So, Rachel must spend $150 on shoes - $50 x 3 and $100 on dress - $200. The answer, therefore, is $350.\nSo the final value is 350.\n\nInput: What is a fruit?

For example, if Sam completes ten skips in the first round and Jeff completes two skips in the first, then the first round skip number for each person can be represented as ten:2.\n3) This process can be applied to all the rounds, and by performing addition and subtraction for each round, the number of skips Jeff completed in each round can be calculated and then added up with the total number of skips completed.\n4) For example, if for the first round, Sam completed ten skips and Jeff completed two skips, then for the second round, Sam completed ten more skips and Jeff completed three fewer skips, the addition would be Sam 10:2 + Jeff 3:2 = 13:5.\n5) Then, the value of '2*5' is four and the final added number is Sam 10:0 + Jeff 4:5 = 14:5.\n6) After performing the same process for each round, the total number of skipping by both the participants will be Sam 100:0 + Jeff (sum of all the rounds) 40:113 = 140:114, and we can obtain the total number of skipped per round by dividing the result with the number of rounds.\n\nIn this case, the total number of rounds completed was 4, and therefore the answer is (140/4) * 14 = 77 skis.\nSo the final average number of skips completed by Jeff = 77", "answer": " 14"}

Hence, their ages are (5-2)=3 months apart. \n4) Similarly, Aivo is 2 months older and Therese is 2 months younger, which means they also have (2\u22122)=0 months apart.\n5) According to their month of birth, we can safely assume Jolyn is at least 4 months older than Therese but definitely younger than 4 months older.\n6) This is because Therese could be born as early as 7 months ago to Jolyn, depending on what months they had in common. Similarly, Therese could be born at least 9 months before to Jolyn, but could also be born several months before or after that.\n7) So, Jolyn could be born on the first month of the year(1/1) to Therese on the ninth month of the year (11/9), but Therese could also be born on different months of the year compared to Jolyn, which we cannot exactly say.\n8) Hence, we can calculate the possible range for Jolyn\u2019s age to be in the range of (1-9)=8 months which means the upper bound could be up to 9 months.\n9) The sum of ages for the four students will be =(9+3+2+0)+4+2+9+0+2+2=35. Then, subtracting 35 from Jolyn, we can get the lowest possible month of her birth =(35-1)=34.\n10) To get the sum of ages, subtracting 34 from Jolyn again, it would equal 34\u221234=0, meaning Jolyn\u2019s month of birth must in fact be the same as Aivo and Leon\u2019s month or Therese\u2019s month.\n11) After substituting the known data", "answer": " 5"}

From these details, we can reasonably infer that the 'tour bus' is a tourist bus. It may transport tourists, who go on an outing or tour, and return back.\n4. Since the 'tourist' involves touring a destination, we can rule out time-related questions like 'How long does it take to do your homework?'\n5. From the rest of the choices, A: sporting event and C: part two boxing, these are unlikely because a bus is not a sporting event, and there is no term called 'part 2 boxing'.\n6. For football(D), a tour bus would involve driving for 55 miles, staying at the destination for two hours, which is like playing a time game or time race, and then driving 10 back on another route that is 10 further away.\n7.

Second, the amount of time Mira takes to run five miles in an hour (based on our knowledge of linear programming) should be used in tandem with the 5 mile/hour speed she sets for her jog.\n3. Third, as there are no other constraints for the time duration, she should be able to pace herself to the length required.\n4. Fourth, since this is a 15 question question, it will be more appropriate to divide it into parts.\n\n5. I will assume that the question is in the form of an arithmetic question, and will break it into multiple simple questions.\nA. Question 1: When is Mira jogging? Answer:  In the morning, 5 days a week\nB. Question 2: How many miles can Mira jog per day? Answer: 25 miles \n- There are a total of five days in a week, so if she paces herself to run a total of 25 miles for all the five days, she will be able to run for 125 miles in a week.\nC. Question 3: How many miles can the total running distance in a week? Answer: 625 miles.\n- She will be able to run a total of  375 miles in a week based on the information provided. \n\n6. As, at this point, we have already calculated the total number of miles she can achieve in a week, she has to run for the same distance in five days. \n7. So, the most suitable answer is B, that Mira can run 25 miles for 5 days, she can run a total of 500 miles in 5 days. \n8.

And, there were 34 dandelions left, which means his dog could not have received any more than 11 dandelions \n4: This means the number of dandelions received by each friend must be less than or equal to 11, and therefore all possible answers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 11.\n5: We know that the answer must be a number between 1 and 24, and therefore, each of the possibilities 1 and 2 cannot be discarded, simply because 40 are not divided between 5 friends, which equals 8, which is an answer that fits within the range.\n6: The first 2 possibilities, 1 and 2, cannot be discarded, because the number of dandleions distributed among the friends must be a number between or equal to 1 and 2.\n7: The question clearly specifies that Caleb picked 40 handfuls of dandelion.

{"text": "1)First, we observe that the river must be 42 feet across as per the question. The given choices are: A) 18 B) 18 C) 10 D) 10 \n2)Next, we notice that each boat's width is 3 feet and that there must be a 2 feet distance between or the riverbank. Using these parameters, we can say that a boat needs at least 5 feet space between it and the other boat(s) or the riverbank, but it may take up to 5 feet 6 inches. So the total space needed between the two boats is at least 5 feet. Based on the width of the river, 42 feet, we can conclude that at least 8 boats can be accommodated on the river(2 is left for each boat).\n3)If the width of the boat is 3 feet and 1 inch, there would be a 1 foot and 6 inch distance between the two boats since the width of the boat would be 3 feet and 2 and a half inches is not divisible by 2. So we can assume the minimum distance between the boats to be 1 feet and 6 inches since that is the smallest distance that would be divisible by 2 (i.e. 5 feet).\n4)We can eliminate \u2018C\u2019, \u2018D\u2019, and \u2018A\u2019 as options as they do not represent the required distance between boats.\n5)The question states \u201cif we allow the river to be 42 feet wide\u201d, the river may accommodate at least 8 boats(leaving 2 feet for each boat on the river). \n6)Therefore, all the required parameters are present in choice \u2018B\u2019.

{"text": "Since the question is asking for multiple answers, I chose to use two. The first two answers are based on the first two parts of the question only. The third answer is based on the second and third part of the question. \n1. For the first part of the question (workdays), Lance works 5 days a week. The question then asks us to work it out equally.\n1.1. It follows that Lance can divide workdays into parts. He can work 35 hours in seven consecutive workdays (8.5 hours in a day).\n1.2. So, Lance can work 4.22 hours in one work day and hence can be paid $37.6 per day.\n1.3. So, working in 5 consecutive days he can earn $188 per day.\n2. To answer this part of the question we need to make sure we take into consideration that we can assume 4.22 of hours per day and not 8.5 as a complete 8.5 is one day.\nSo, we need to work out an average of 8.5 (that's 4.22 divided by 2)\n2.1. We divide 35/2 and add with 4.22.\n3. To consider the second part of the question (hourly rate of $9) in order to answer this question we need to consider one more aspect. The question states that we have to work it out equitably.\nSo, here we need to consider that Lance works 35 hours in every work week and not just once. So, to get a complete overview of his average workweek (35/7) we have to take into consideration that he works 35 in total.\n3.1. We multiply and divide, so 35/7 equals 5, then we multiple and divide 9 by 5 and we get that Lance's average workweek rate of $9 equals $1.35/hour\nTherefore the answer for $1 and above is $9.\nThe answer for $1 and $1.1 is $9.\nAnything more that that is extra.", "answer": " 63"}

We can immediately see that for a consumption rate of 1.5 kWh/hr, there is no consumption. But for 4 kWh/hr, the oven is consuming the entire hour and then some, and with the price at 10 cents, this means that the total monthly cost would be 60 cents, or $0.60/hour.\n3.

{"text": "1) Harry took 4 blue and 5 green weights. \n\n2) Harry had to create his bar out of four bags of 2 lb blue weights and 5 bags of 3 lb green weights.\n\n3) At least 9 lb blue weights and 15 lb green weights were needed to complete the task using those weights.\n\n4) The bar itself weighing 2 lb was not part of the task.\n\n5) Harry used 9 lb blue weights 15 lb green weight bags.\n\n6) Since each of two 2 lb weights equals to 4 lb and five 3 lb equal to 15 lb, we can say that every blue weight bag weighs 4 lb and every green weight bag weighs at least 3 lb as well.\n\n7) The correct answer is 14 lb, for every 4 lb equals to 2 lb and every 3 lb equals to 1 lb, thus 9 4 lb each will equal 2 lb as well and 4 lb for every 5 3 lb bags will result in 1 lb.\nSo the total weigh will be 2+2+5+5+9 = 24 lb. But remember, the bar weighs 2 lb hence we add 2 and the total weight will be 24 lb plus 2 lb.\nThus the total weight will be (2x4)+(2x5)+(x4)+(x5)+4+2 = 14 lb.\nSo the final number will be 14+2=14 lb.\n\n\nInput: Harry took a plane from his city to his town.

In each class, there are 15 students. If 4 students are expelled from a class, and students who were not expelled were offered 3, how many remaining students will be in that class?\nOutput:   2. As the question suggests, There are 15 students in each class. If 4 students were eliminated through the 'expulsion' and students who were not eliminated by that process received three replacement students, this would result in 15-4= 11 remaining students \n3. Therefore, the question is to ascertain the number of remaining students if they were offered three replacement students, which is given in the final choice. \n4. And given the answer choice, the number of remaining students is nine(since a total of 11 were initially in the class with 15 students before the expulsion process and an additional three students were replaced with 15 students).\nSo the final answer nine\nIn the same way we can proceed for other questions.", "answer": " 240"}

We can also assume that this holds true for now and that the brother is twice as old as the sister.\nSo, in addition, from the first statement we can substitute the brother's age and his sister's age, so that the first statement reads\nBrother's age + Sister's age = 20\n5: Therefore, substituting these values, we now have\nBrother's Age + Sister's Age = 20\nBut we now have 2 new variables, their combined age and their difference in age.\nSister's Age + Brother's age = 45\nDifference in Age = 25\n6: The difference between the two ages is 25, and since the sister is 20, she is then 25 years older than the brother, and the brother is therefore 20 + 25 = 45 years old\n7: So using the given information in the problem, we can determine that the current age of the sister is 45, which means she is twice her brother's age, which in turn will be half of 20, or 10, in ten years' time\nSo the final answer based on the given input is E: 50", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "1. Firstly, we have to find how deep a snowdrift will be considering all four days. If we use the same formula as before, in this question the volume of snow is V=LWH, where L,H,and W are the length, height and width of the drift in that particular day. For each day, V is the total of all the layers of snow it accumulates in that day. This way, V=13X+6X+6X+18X(13+6+6+18), where X is the amount of snow that falls on that day. Since the accumulated snow is equal to the volume of snowfall on that day, (V)x(1/34inch)=X so V=13X1/34X34=(1/34)X34+(1/34) X10+(1/34), so V=1048576.\n2. From here, we multiply 104850X3 and get 31,977,068, so L is 0.86 feet and H is 3.70 feet. This is then rounded to 3.7 ft.\n3. Then we multiply H*W, which is 13,320, so W is 1,042,697, and finally we have L*W, then 0.86*1,123 =393.7 so L is 394 inches if we round it to 400 it\u2019s 400 X 1.8 inches is 720 so the answer is 720.\nSo the final answers are 720 inches\n\nInput:A dog was in a room that was divided into 8 equal sections.

{"text": "1) This is a situation where two separate units are traveling in the same direction.  There will be more than a 200-ft distance for the cheetah to cover in order to catch up. \n2) Since the question asks about two separate units traveling in the same directions, only one unit will make each mile.\n3a) Thus, the first milestone would be the distance each of the two units travels toward the opposite of the other.  Since the cheetah moves faster, it covers one mile in eight minutes.  However, the gazelle gets halfway and covers.5 miles before the cheetah gets to.5 miles.  Each unit travels at top speed the whole time, meaning they cover one mile in the given amount of time.\n3b) The cheetah would cover two miles before the gazelle covers one because the cheetah has a top speed of 30 mph while the gazelle has a top speed of only 20 mph (60 mph minus half of 20 mph to get the average of 30).\n4) The cheetah has covered two miles when the gazelle has covered one.  The difference in their speeds is two miles covered over 8 miles (that the cheetah covered in the same amount of time).  Therefore, the cheetah would have to work even harder, as now it would have to travel 4 miles more to catch the gazelle.  Also, now the gazelle would cover.5 miles over the cheetah covering.5 miles.  That is a 4 mile distance that the cheetah will have to go to catch up.\n5) As of the third one-quarter mile mark, the cheetah will cover five miles and the gazelle will cover less than 1.5 miles.  The two units will be separated by 3.5 miles, as the cheetah traveled 2.5 miles toward the gazelle while the gazelle traveled 1.5 miles toward the cheetah.  The answer will be one-sixth, 5/16, 3/8, or 8 hours later.

{"text": "1) Firstly, we can see that the primary characters in this situation are the judge and the driver/ motorist who was committing the illegal act of speeding.\n2) We can also see certain elements of this issue - a penalty, payments and costs, increased fees, and additional elements. The description given above clearly indicates that there is a penalty or added cost involved.\n3) It is evident from the details given in the above paragraph that we need to identify the fines that are in charge. \n4) Firstly, we check all the conditions and details mentioned where we can calculate the additional charge. For the base fine of $50, the mileage rate of 75miles/hour, which is 125miles per hour, and the speeding zone limit of 30miles/hour. So we have, 125 -30 = 95 over the speed limit which is an increase of 45miles per hour. However, based on the conditions and details presented, we can only apply penalty on each mileage increment on the scale of 1 mile per hour. \n5) We can calculate the total penalty amount from the formula of $2 * ( 45 / 1), which gives $80. But unfortunately, the information given does not permit us to arrive at an accurate amount of fine.\n6) After that, we can move on to the next increment where we can determine the penalty amount. And the next increment is 60 miles per hour, which is 90 mph over the limit. The penalty amount can be computed using the formula of (2 * ( 90 / 1)) = 180. So we arrive at a base fine of $130.\n7). The next increment is 100, which is 25 mph over the limit, and the penalty amount is (2 * (25 / 1)) = $50. So, the base fine by now for Mark is $130.

The first method is measure the amount of degrees the angle measures. This is called measuring the angle from a protractor.  The second method is to use the thumbs and forefingers. Put your thumb of your left hand to the vertex A of the angle on the same side of your left hand. Then put the forefinger of your right hand to the right side vertex of the same angle. Then compare these two vertex and you will see the measure of this angle is greater than the amount the angle measures. This method is called using the thumbs and forekingers method. The third method is to use the finger and hand method. With the fingers of the right hand to side vertex of the angle, measure it by the fingers of your left hand in order. The measure of this angle will be greater than the amount of the angle it measures.\nOutput: The first method of measurement of angles (measuring the angle from a Protractor) is more accurate and suitable because all the other techniques for angles measurement are done in terms of degrees and fractions while the first method is done in terms of degrees", "answer": " 2000"}

Given that each of these actors is on set for about 15mins, we can say that approximately 2 actors will be on set at any time point.\n2. So, if we start with the assumption that the show will run for about 5 minutes, the maximum number of actors that can be on set initially would be 1.\n3. After about 15mns, or 2nd point in time, another 2 actors can come on set. If this process is repeated 10 times, or every 0.5hrs, there would be a total of 50 actors that can be on the set at any single time point.\n4. If we multiply this with 1(5min), we can get the total no. of actors that can be active on the set over an hour.\n5. The process repeats every 0.5rs, and the total number of actors that can have been on set over an hour is 50(a) * 20(b)=100 actors.\n6.

{"text": "1)The hot air balloon question involves a calculation about a constant rate of increase in the rate at which balloons burst, which shows that each balloon burst proportionally to the sum of the rate at which it blew up before. The calculations involved are mathematical.\n2) To answer the question, we need to start by assuming that the balloon is blown up by hot air, not by electricity or other means. We also assume that each balloon costs $1000, so we're looking for a number X that is less than the total number of baloons in the hot air bailoon, or $200,000.00.\n3) The question starts with N being the total number of baloonns in the hot air baloon and X is the number of ballooms in the hot air balunon of baloons still intact.\n4) At first, the total number of balonsns, N, would have been 1+X=200 and then it would be 1+X+1/5 of the original 1+X=1.25X\n\n5) This is a difference problem, and a simple difference problem can be solved by subtracting the final x from the original x, which in a difference problem, is a difference of one: 1-X or 1-(200-X).\n\n6) So, (1-(1.25X)) = (0.75X)\n7) Since X is the number of hot air baloons still intacct, there are X baloons still intack, so this means the formula of 0.75X.00 tells us that X should be (less than $200000) 0.75 X 200,0 = 150,000, which is less tham $200, which means it's possible for there to be 150, 00 less hot air balloons in the original hot air balloon to still be intact when you combine how many balloons were intack to start with, plus half balloons still remain intack, which means we can assume 150, -49,950 intact baloons still remain in the hot air balo", "answer": " 80"}

It allows us to assume that initial profit is $10 and then split it in half, after that she received the total donation of $610 and add to one half of her profit, so it will be $960.25, then subtract 610 from 960.2, that's mean minus 350, we get 610.25 - 350 = $260.25. 6) Finally, we get $5 + $260. 25, this 260.2 + 5 = $265.2, so we have an answer, 265.25.\nSo the final is 265. 25", "answer": " 180"}

Inflation can cause people to make less money. So the answer to this question is Falling prices(No 3). Here are the details about why it is the answer for this question:\n2. Inflation makes people's money worth less. They make more money because their salary stays the same. But the money they put towards items has lost value.\n3.

{"text": "1) 130 cards have already been given out, so there must be a balance of at least 1 (one) 2x2 rectangle 2) The only two numbers that sum to 8 in 130 (130+130) are 19 and 39. 3) In that case, if 5 is the highest, then the possible total range of cards that Rick can hand to Miguel is 32 (5x6).\n4) After accounting for the cards he gave to his 2 sister's (3 cards each), that leaves his 15 cards (35 cards left). This makes it easier to solve for 12 (12x6) cards that he hands to his friends, which is the only remaining amount, given all of the other information. 5) Miguel gets the cards, as that is Rick's highest priority.\nSo the final number of cards given to Miguel is 35 cards or 32+3 cards. \nSo the final answer in the answer space is 35.\n\nInput:If all of the planes from City A landed at City B first, then they flew to City C together. After this trip, the planes all left the city. Which of the following cities ended up with the most air travelers that day?  Choices: A: city a  B: city c  C: city b  D: city b + city c  E: city c + city b\nOutput: 1.) The planes must first landed at city B first (city a) since there are no other flights to the city C.\n\n2) The planes all left the town, hence they did not stay at city C (D and E are incorrect).\n\n3) As there are no air travelers in cities A or C, they cannot receive a higher number of air travelers than city B at any point.\n\n4) Thus, the only cities in contention are options A: city a, B: city b, and C: city c.

John sold the cow for $3.00 per pound.  Therefore, the total amount John made from selling the cow is:   (3 x 450) + (3 x 550) x $3 =$ $1350\nSo, the cow, before being fattened, was sold for $225, and after it was fattened and sold, it was sold for $1350.

It involves the bonus offered by working harder, and whether the additional 2 hours is worth the same amount.\n2 From this scenario, the total compensation of John includes $80 per day plus the performance bonus if he chooses to earn it, which the problem states is an extra $20.\n3 At this stage, we can also note that if the extra bonus is the same amount as what is earned when working harder for 2 extra hours, then we can infer that the performance bonus for working an additional 2 hours is $20.\n4. With these pieces of information it is now possible to solve the question.\n5.

The fact that she has 'erased 40 sentences she typed incorrectly' shows that she typed more than what she had to, i.e. 536. So, the starting amount of sentences can be calculated as 536 - 40 = 500.\n3. The question is now to calculate the number of total sentences Janice began with. One way of solving this is using \"elapsed time\" or \"elapsed minutes.\"\n4. The total amount of time Janice worked on the same paper = 128 minutes (58 + 20)\n5. The elapsed time from when Janice began writing the paper to when she finished is 128 minutes minus\nthe total amount of time she worked on the said paper.\n6. In this case, 128 - 128 = 0 minutes or 0 seconds. This means the total number of sentences she began with = 0.\n7.

{"text": "1) The street mentioned in the question is Happy Street which has the least number of cars. Hence, the total number of cars traveling down the street can be obtained by adding together the individual number of cars traveling on each day by subtracting the cars travelling on the previous day.\n2) Monday can be assumed to be the first day of the week.\n3) On Monday, there are ~20 extra cars that are commuting down the street than were there on Tuesday. Hence, total number of cars travelling on Monday = total number (+20) cars seen on the previous day Tuesday.\n4) The total number of cars travling on Tuesday = Tuesday's traffic (-25) plus previous day Monday's traffic (+20).\n5) Similarly, the total number of total cars travling on Wednesday = Wednesday's traffic (~37) plus previous day Monday traffic (~25).\n6) The total number of total cars traveling down the Happy Street on the weekend = ~5 + 5 * 2.\n7) The total number of car traveling on each day of week can be calculated by adding individual traffic on individual day and subtracting it from previous day.\n8) The total total number of cars = ~98.\n9) Therefore, to get the individual number of cars, divide the total number of cars with the individual days: Monday = 80 cars; Tuesday = 80 cars(20 = ~285); Wednesday= 80 * 3 (120 = 454); Thursday = ~500;Friday 500 cars and Saturday ~1600; Sunday = 4150 cars traveling to and from the street.\n\n\n#### \ud83c\udf93 Solution\n```python\nans = []\ndef calculate(question):\n    print(question)\n    #ans.append(question.lower())\n    ans.append('')\n    ans.append(str(question))\n    ans =''.join(ans)\n    print(ans.capitalize())  \n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        file = open('Input.txt', 'r')\n        for line in file:\n            if not line.", "answer": " 97"}

She can be collecting as many as she wants as she is the only one to do so. He collected 20 fruits from each tree, there are 20 plants per tree. So each tree has two plants. We can find out how many trees she had if we are given how many plants had been planted and the total number of fruits he collects.  \nSo 100 fruits were collected but he planted 60% (60/100) of those plants so he planted 100/0.6=166.6.   \nSo she planted 20(60/10=13) plants.  So (13*2=26) trees in total, but only him is collecting fruits so we only add the 26 to the 2  we know he collected 20 from each plant so he only had two that had fruits on them.\nSo 25 is the answer (26-2==25)\n\nInput:1/31/2023, what year is it?\nOutput: 1/31/ 2023 =1/06/2023  but we do not need it if we know the month and year \n\nInput:-094344331070310 is a binary number, what is the decimal value of this number?\nOutput: 5178418932793728355 which can also be expressed in decimal as 5178.41893e+09\n\nInput:10/01, what month is it?\nOutput: october.

{"text": "In this question, Max asks for two train gifts every year for the first five years.\nAdditionally, the given fact says that his parents give him what he asks for every year, and at the end of the 6th year they give him double the number he currently has.\nFrom this information, we can conclude the following:\n1. Max asked for an increasing number of trains every year for the first 5 years. That means the number of trains he got was initially 0, and then each year grew from 0 to 2.\n2. However, at the end of the first 5 years, his current stock is doubled, so it becomes 4 trains.\n3.

The common thing about both trains is there is a train that is fast, and another train that is slow. \n3. Since we cannot deduce if two trains are slow and one is fast, we disregard all choices B: fast is correct and correct.\n4. It is not specified what the difference between the two trains is as per the question, so we can't determine which train is faster/slower. Since we've eliminated B: fast is correct, \n5. We can further eliminate C: faster is faster because we can't determine if it is faster to be traveling on either train.\n6.

{"text": "The question asks Frank how many pounds of peanuts he eats on average every day. Let's start by re-writing the given information into math to try to make some assumptions - We know that he's eating 1 week, so he must have (w) pound of peanuts in the week (1 wnd 3), which means he has 1 week/3 pounds = 1/3 of a pound in a typical day.\n1. If we take this figure, we now have 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/7 = 3/7 =.429 = 42.9% (approx) as a final answer. But it doesn't end there - it's very obvious that we didn't need to make as many assumptions as we did before, because we've answered 2 out of 7 with $3 bills left over. \n2. So, with 3/7 figure, we know the answer, and the only remaining assumption is how many days there are in a week to figure out how many pounds he's eating on average per day. \n3. This can be calculated by knowing the number of five and ten dollar bills that Frank has and how many times that 5x + 5y = 7x, which gives us a 50/50 combination - so half the time he'll get a ten-dollar bill and the other half will get a five-dollar bill.

The function value is an integer at 3 and it doesn't have an increasing order between [3,5] since f(3) - f(4) = 2, and f(4) - f(5) = -1, which means that it's constant after being assigned an integer 3.

Generally,'should' indicates necessity, so the answer is necessary to do something, in this case, make coffee.\nIn this scenario, under-caffeinating means a person has not had enough coffee. So, let's go with the answer'making coffee' as an action one can undertake for this situation.\n1. For the word'suspect', Dictionary.com defines it as 'to think or have as a supposition or conjecture'\n2. So, when it says we'suspect' someone is under-caffeinated, it implies we can make an educated guess that the person is drinking too little coffee. But it is not confirmed that the person is under-caffenated, so we must take care not to over-caffeinate someone either.\n3. We can do this by carefully noting how they respond to various quantities of coffee and monitoring their health in the event of either too much or little caffeine.\n4. By observing this way, one can help the person get their caffeine level to where it should be.\n5. We can summarize the instructions as making coffee for someone who is under-caffeinate.\n6. Therefore A,B,C,D and E are incorrect answers.\nThe answer is E.\n\nInput: The student ate all of the dessert even though they said they wouldn't.

In other words, an unsuccessful attempt at being true to oneself will result in non-consistent behaviour.", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "1. The context of the question revolves around shopping for things related to cooking. Hence, Eve's purchases are most likely for her nieces, who are children, as opposed to cookware for herself.\n2. The hand mitts cost 14 dollars. The other items are cheaper than this. Hence, we can rule out that hand mitts are sold as a set. \n3. In this light, the first thing that the store will offer Eve in her discount is the set of 3 cookware utensils.  \n4. We also know that a set of cooking utensils cost 10 dollars and a large kitchen knife is twice such a set. Hence, we further conclude that the store will automatically discount this set with Eve's discount and she will be getting a set of cookware items at 7 dollars only(7 * 3 = 21).\n5. Now if one adds up the cost of the hand mitts and the apron it comes to 26 dollars. But in such cases, the store would not give an additional discount on these items. \n6. We can conclude that we have to add the price of the hand mitts, apron, and 3 sets of cookware utensils together.\n7. We can also consider the fact that Eve cannot be buying these 3 sets for her 3 nieces, as it is unlikely that one individual would spend such money on buying cookware for 3 different children at once. \nHence, 25% discount or a sum of 14(hand mitts), 16(apron), 21(3 sets), and 10(1 set remaining) are all that Eve will be spending with an additional discount on those items.\nSo the final and correct answer is 10(1set remaining), 21(apron), 7(3 utensils), 21(set), 10(3 utensils). \n\nInput: The restaurant owner has to be honest, he knows that there are $1 apples, $2 bananas, $3 tomatoes, $5 avocados that he sells in the restaurant.

{"text": "1. The question mentions 'having eaten' PBJ sandwiches, implying that it is the past tense, which indicates it is from a school year already completed.\n2. A 36-week school year with no breaks or holidays means that if he is having PBJ sandwich for lunch, he would have eaten 152 sandwiches ( 36 weeks/ 2 school days= 18 PBJs a week, 18x 12 months /12 months in a single year=152 sandwich). To determine the required number of sandwiches, we simply have to subtract the number of days he missed from 152.\n3. The first missing day is Friday, and there are 51 Fridays in a school year.\n4. From the remaining number of days (152- 51), we can immediately subtract the second missing day, Friday and get the required number of PBJ to be 90\n5. Then we multiply this number by 18 as it would require 18 PBJ as it is the standard number of PBJ for a week.\n6.

It's not explicitly mentioned in the problem.\n3) However, we can infer that because Kelsey picked 30 apples and Maggie picked 42 apples, 'Layla' could have picked fewer than those apples.\n4) Therefore, after averaging the apples of all 3 girls, it is safe to assume that Layla picked fewer than all the other three pickers and is likely to be less than 22.\n5) The given choices are 5, 15, 20, 30, 40, None which doesn't make much sense since choosing 5 apples would mean Layla picked 8 (5+3), which is definitely not the final average.\nIf Layla picked 7 apples, she would have contributed 9 to the final average value.\n6) However, as per the information, Layla picked fewer apples than 7, most probably fewer than 22, as discussed above.\n7) So the number of apples Layla would have picked is less than 9 or greater than 16.\n\n8) Therefore, Layla picked 16 apples. \nSo the final answer value is 16\n\nInput: The train\u2019s head is 200 meters long.

How long would it take to eat a watermelon?  Do you have any guesses? \nOutput: First, notice that the question is regarding a watermelon and not a whole banana because if a whole banana took 3 minutes then it would also take 3 minutes to eat half a banana plus it would be too wide to fit in your mouth. It is assumed that only one piece will be eaten. \nHere the order of the elements matters. For instance, an apple was eaten in a minute so a watermelon would take less time than it. However, a starfruit took three minutes so \nthe total time of eating the starfruit would be longer than the total time to eat a banana and this would be the case for other fruit too. \nSince a banana had the lowest amount of time to eat then the time to eat a watermellon would be similar to the total time to eat the three fruit so it will be 1 minute and 30 seconds. Hence the final answer will be 1 minute 30 seconds\n\n\nSo the final answer\nInput: What do humans do in a city to connect to nature?

First, we can calculate house rental and food budgets individually and see if there is an overlap or any other additional information given, or if we have enough information to answer the question. One of the formulas for finding the monthly budget of house rental is: Total house rental = annual house rental * 12.\n3. Therefore, the formula to calculate the monthly amount is: 240 = 12 * annual house rental. So, annual house rental = 240/12 = 20.\n4. Similarly, we can use the same formula to find out Luna\u2019s food budget monthly: 240/60 = 40\n5. Now, based on the information provided about the percentage of food budget to house rental, we can derive the monthly food budget for Luna: 40 * 60% = Rs 24\n6.

Choices: 1: one tap of computer 9 times 2: two taps to the computer 3: 3 taps to computer\nOutput: 1: one of the choices is 3 taps on computer. Therefore, one can multiply the number of three taps by 3 to obtain the result of 9 for taps on computer 9 times.\n2: one of the choices of two taps to computer is the option of tapping the computer in a sequence of 2 taps at a time. So, the multiplication of 2*2 will also yield the result 9 of taps on computer 12 times.\n3: One is a number divisible by 3 which is 1. So the number of taps on computer which is 9 and the result can be obtained by division.\n4: Therefore, the result for 9 taps on computer and three taps on computer will differ by 6.\nSo the final result for this question is 9 taps to computer =3 taps to computer +3", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "There are three components, each with different information.\n1. The three holes in the garages roof leak at different rates.\n2. The largest hole leaks 3 ounces per minute.\n3. The medium-sized holes leaks at one-half of the rates of the largest holes.\n4. And finally, the smallest hole leaks at one-third of the rate of the medium hole.\n\n1. To solve this question, first let's consider the rate at which each hole leaks water. We can write 3 as C, 1/2 as M and 1/3 as L. (for example C=3, M=1/2 and L=1/3)\n2. Let's assume the time that have elapsed since it has rained (as per question 1) and the amount of water that has leaked in those period (as per question 2). Using these, we can write the equations.\nFor C, we can write the equation as follows; C= R \u00d7 2 (i.e C(quantity)=R(rate) \u00d7 T(unit of time))\nC=(R\u00d72)/60\nC = R \u00d7 2 / 60\n\nLet's assume C = (1/60) * 3\nC = 1/60\n=0.016667\n\nFor M, we can then write the equation as follows:\nM= 1/2 *C\nM= 1 / 2 * 1/60 = 1/120\nM = 0.005\n\nFinally, for L, we can write the formula\nL= 1/3 *(M/2)\n\nThe answer is 9: (C+M+L)\n\nSo the final answer for this problem is 9.", "answer": " 600"}

(euros)\nOutput: 1) Round the price to the nearest thousand. In Euros, we're using decimals. So we round to 1000 euros, or 10,000 decimal place(s).\n2) Because we're using \"what percentage\", you can either set the denominator, or the numerator.\n3) Here, we're using the numerator.\n4) Here'sales tax' means you're supposed to subtract the sales tax from the price. The question asks for the sales tax.\n5) Sales tax must be rounded up to the decimal.\n6) When you have a decimal, 21 is not considered a 2, its considered a 0.\n7) 12% of 9882 is 1,120.21 \n8) Sales tax is equal to 1% less than the actual percentage.\n9) % Less than 1 = 0.99 so the sales tax is 0.01 less than 112 = 111.01\n\nInput: There are 14 students in the class.

{"text": "1) Since the answer choices require division and are given in decimals, then this question requires division to determine the answer because the question states the two operations required to answer the question. (8)\n\n2) As for the details, Madison's dog is among five dogs. Therefore they can all be counted in this division. (8)\n2) We begin with (15/2). (3/4) x (5/2) = (2.5/4) and (2.5/6). Then from there, we subtract (2.5) from (3.5). So, (1/1.5) x (5/3) = (3/6), (3/4) and (3/5). (11)\n\n3) There are 5 dogs with spots and 3/5 with pointy ears. (6)\nHalf of dogs have spots and pointy ears.\n\n3) From the details in the question, we know the percentage of all dogs with spots. So we multiply these by (5/2).

Harry ran an average pace 6.6/hour on Friday\n\nInput: What number goes one, two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty...\nOutput; It goes on exponentially\nSo the final answer : 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 and so on...\n\nInput: I want to go home after 20 minuets. How long will it take me to travel 500 miles at 60 miles an hour?\nOutput:1. Firstly, as specified, 60 miles an hours is the rate of travel, not the actual speed. This means that he is traveling 60mph over one hour.\n2. So, in 20 minutes, he'd cover 120.00(miles/hour) miles.\n3. Since it is 500 miles, he'd cover a 500*120.0 = 60000 miles per hour in 20 minutes.\n4. So, 500 miles in 20 mins(120 mins/hour) = 25000/120 = 208.33/hour.\n5. We round off the answer at 200.0 mph.\nSo the answer is : 200 miles/hour\n\nInput: How many times does the number 52 fit into 1111,", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "1.) Firstly, we can eliminate option A: Miles as it is incorrect. \n2.) Option C: Kilometers is another wrong choice as it is measured in units of length and swimming, running and walking are not measured in the units of length. \n3.) Option B: Hours and minutes is incorrect as it is measured in time units. \n4.) We know Tom swims for a duration of 2 hours which means 720 minutes. \n5.) To find the total distance traveled, the total time spent swimming and running must be divided by the total swimming speed. \n6.) As Tom run for half the time, 2 hours must be divided by 2. \n7.) So, Tom ran for an hour or 60 minutes. \n8.) Accordingly, Tom covered about 3 mile in an hour or 18 miles in 60 minutes. Thus he covered a total of about 240 miles in 2 hours.\nSo the final is E: 240 miles\n\nInput: There are a dozen dwarfs in a party. How many girls are there?

{"text": "1.  Based on the data available, we can calculate the net amount as follows: The cost of 500 pounds = 500x20.00 = $10 000. Adding expenses from tickets sold = $1000 + $10000 = $11000. Profits = 50000-11000 = $39000. Since we have got two numbers, positive and negative, we can solve the problem by addition and subtraction as: sum of (positive and negative numbers) or (positive + negative). Positive number is $3900 The negative number is -11000 Add the two numbers = 3900+ -1100 Or $3900 +(-11000) = $ 630 The given solution is $500 plus 630, which adds up to the given solution of $3900, so we are going to give 630 as a right answers. We are going to solve the positive and negative by adding the two numbers. The solution is positive and negative 500.\n\nInput: A man rents out his apartment $810 a month.

{"text": "1. The question asks for a solution where 6 ribbons can be used equally among themselves, where each ribbon will use 2 yards.\n2. This means that each ribbon will have 2/6th of its length remaining.\n3. To calculate this, we add all the 6 ribbons together.\n4. 1+2+3+4+5+6 gives us 14, which we divide into 2/6th, giving us 2/6th as 2.\n5. This means that 2/6th = 2/14th as 2 has been divided by 6 and 14 has been divided by 1.\n6. Therefore, 2/6th times 6 (since every ribbon needs to be used 2/6) gives us 2 yards of ribbons remaining\nSo the final answer (by a simple calculation of subtraction) is 2", "answer": " 6"}

To that we subtract 2 fruits of bucket B to get 7. With those 7 fruits added to the 12 fruits already in bucket A, the total fruits add up to 27.\n6) But we know we have to include bucket C in the total. We are missing 2 fruits from bucket B. So we add 2 fruits in bucket B and subtract 1 fruit in bucket C. This brings us to 6 fruits in bucket C. Because bucket C has 9 fruits all together, this would mean that a negative 3 fruits are in bucket C.\n\n7) Now we subtract 6 (3 negative) fruits from bucket C to get a total of 3 fruits remaining in the bucket. 8) This means we now have 29 fruits in buckets 1 & 2.\n9) To figure out the final number of fruits in the bucket collection, we add 2 additional fruits (to get to the desired total of 32 fruits). \n10) This yields 27 + 2 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 2 which equals 32 in total fruits.\nSo the final number is 32 fruits", "answer": " 37"}

{"text": "1) First, we need to determine how many coins Jake has at the beginning. From the question sentence, we can infer that Jake has 80 bitcoins, so the answer is 80.\n2) Now we need to know how many coins he has after the donations to charity. First, we have to understand that a donation to charity requires transferring the money from a giver's hand to a receiver's hand. It involves no money transaction. Therefore, it does not increase the number of coins. That means, after donating to charity, the number of coins Jake has will remain 80.\n3) To further understand the value of the money after donating, we need to know the original number of coins donated to charity. The sentence 'he then gives half of all of the bitcoins he has' suggests that he donates $20 as a whole amount, not a part. 4 Therefore, the number of co-ins he has after the first donation is 60.\n5) After tripling the previous number, Jake has 490 coins now. 1+2-2-98-140 = 490 co-ins. In the sentence 'After that, he donates another 5 coins', we cannot make the assumption that he donates five bitcoins. It could be five any other value of bitcoins. Even if we assume it to be five bitcoins, his number of coins will be increased by three. Jake will have a total number of 545 coins now.  This brings us to the final number of coins - 545.\nIn conclusion, the final answer is 545\n\nInput: An office worker named George works from nine to seven.  What time does he leave the office?

{"text": "1.)This has all the aspects of a logic punch and requires you to break it down into individual steps to solve it.\n2. The logic is: The total number of guests must be equal to at least the original number added together with their invited guests.\n3. Ashley =20, 30 guests\n4. Firstly, we must take care of the total number of guests = the first number in our equation + (the number of guests invited + invited guests' invited guests). For instance, 20 guests invited 10 guests so we'll use this.\n5. 20+ (10+10) -> 20+20 -> 40 guests in total.\n6. We can similarly break down the rest of the equation. Ashley and her invited guests are already taken into consideration so we don't need to do that again.\n7. Therefore, since the last number added is the number of guests multiplied by 2, we can solve this using the equation 'guests = (20+the number of guests invited) x 2. This then leads to the final answer of 44 guests.\nSo the final solution is: 20 + [ 20 x (10 + (10*1) ] -> [ 20 x 20] -> [40] -> [44]\n\nInput:  Which word in the first paragraph does not rhyme with the first word in the second paragraph?

We know that the number of donuts in a dozen is 12.\n3. Now, based on the information given, we can see that Javier will spend $28 for a dozen (2\u00d7$14).\n4. For the first dozen, Javier will sell $120 in total (12\u00d7$10).\n5. However, for each donut sold, Javier will lose a profit of $1. Since, 10*$2.40=$24 is equal to a $1 lost, we see that Javier is left with a profit of $2.50/2 donut ($1.25 per donut).\n6. After selling 24 of his donut, Javier gains a total of $2.5/2 = $1.25 per dozen of sold donuts.\n7. After that, for each donut he sold, he would gain $1.25, so Javier would have to sell 22 dozen donuts (144 donuts / $1.25 = 115 donuts - $7 for each dozen of unsold donuts) to reach his $96 goal.\n8.

The word 'Percentage' in the question adds another layer of confusion because it can be used in different ways.

First, we assume that all speeds are measured in the same unit(For example, all speeds are measured by the amount of time it takes to go 10km/hr).\n2.) Now we assume that'side to side' is our baseline which we will use as the number 1 for comparison.\n3.) For option A: 'Arms from the chest to side', the total distance is equal to twice the length of the arms which is 3.8m because 1m + 1m = 2m.\n4.) Therefore the total time it takes to go 'Arms from the sides to the chest' equals to time 1/2.8 for option A)\n5.)

{"text": "1- firstly, we will do our best to answer this question using the assumptions listed so far. A deep sea monster comes up to the deck of the ship only once every hundred years, where it sates its hunger. Ships have grown in size over the past 300 years. If each of the original 847 people from the last ships were divided between the two new ships, we should have 423 - half of these numbers each. This would imply that the number of new people consumed by the monster in one hundred years should be 854 - because each ship had 423 people on it.  \n2. However, in the final part of question where ships have been built larger over, we don't know how big each ship was. so, we are limited to assume that each ship has the same number of people 423 every hundred year \n3. Because of this we should be able to get to 712, so, 712 should be the right answer \n4. Now, let us assume that each ship has five hundred people. We would then also know that we need to divide the number of people in the second ship, by the number of people in first ship. \n5. This gives 500/847, which reduces to 601/424. Using the concept of a percentage, we can find the percentages of the first ship and second ship as 42.85% and 57.15% respectively, which means that the first ship had more than 40% as compared to the second ship, so it is the first ship that the monster ate \n6. Thus, the answer to our question should be the first ship, with 42.78 %, which, given that it is a round number, is 42%. Therefore, the correct answer is 42\nSo the final answer to this question is 42\n\nInput: How long does it take a man to die from asphyxiation when inside a well?

{"text": "1) Based on the fact that Jeanette can juggle 2 objects more than the week before, we can assume that she starts with at least 1 object, which means we can disregard 0, and focus on the 1, 2, and 3 options for her initial juggling count.\n2. Since we know she can juggle 3 objects when she practices for 5 weeks (using the rule of 2 more objects than last week), we can use a number line representing the weeks she practices to estimate the following counts per week: \n3. 3+2 = 5 the first week, 5+2 = 7 the second week, 7+2 = 9 the third week, 9+2 =11 the fourth week, and 11+2 = 13 the fifth week.\n4. Now, since we know the total number of objects Jeanette can juggle is 13: 13 = 2 (for every 2 weeks), so we know 13 is an even number so Jeanette can juggle an odd number of objects, let\u2019s say 13 = 3 x y + 1, therefore, x + y = 9 and 1 + y = 2 (because if Jeanette can juggle them in sets of 2, then she needs 1 at the start and 2 on the end, 3 + 2= 5).\n5.

{"text": "The first step is to convert the input values into a common unit. Since one gallon of whole milk is equivalent to 3.785 litres, the discount of $1 mentioned earlier converts into $3.785.\n1. Subsequently, the question is about discounts applied to 1 gallon of whole milk and 1 box of cereal. Thus, the correct unit of measurement becomes US gallons, or 1 US gallon = 3.78 litres (approximate).\n2. This value is important to estimate the savings for 5 boxes of cash because since 1 gallon equals the units used earlier, 5 boxes is equivalent to $16.9225.\n3. Now that we have determined the necessary units, we can solve the problem via the equation.\n4.

However, using both sanitizers together doesn't necessarily increase the kill effectiveness.\n2. Additionally, given that 5% of the 'germs' they kill are the same, we can assume that the sanitizers probably target different kinds of germs, rather than just different percentages of the same kinds of germs.\n3. There are five options for A: germs, B: microbes, micro organisms, viruses, bacteria. Based on the context of the question, we can exclude choices B: microbes, C: micro organism and choices D: viruses and E: bacteria for the reasons stated in points (2) and (3) above.\n4. To further refine our answers, we can look at the question in this manner: Germs are being killed with different percentages. The kill percentage of both these sanitizers when used together will therefore be higher than that of individually (since the percentage is additive), however, it will not be perfect because of the small percent of germs killed that are the same after both of them, no matter which percent.\n5. To solve this problem: We can first multiply the 50% kill by 0.5 to give 25%, the other 5% is multiplied by 0.25 to give 1.25%, and the other 85% is the combination of these two which gives 54.35% and finally we need to subtract the 5% of these two so the final answer would be 49.35%.\n6.

Similarly, if he needs 11 cars per row to search in Section H as well, he needs 11*20=220 minutes.\n7) This means that he took a total of 445 minutes to search both sections.\n8) As Section G has 180 minutes, he took 445-180=265 minutes to search in Section H.\n9) So, Section H took 265/80 = 3.25 times the amount of time, 3.25*80 = 265 minutes, to search\n10) So, the given question states that Nate got lost looking for the car in a lot. So he had to first search every row in Section H to find the car for 265 minutes. As well as, every row in Section G, which took 180 minutes.\n  11) Hence, the answer is G: 445-265=180 minutes. So, it took Nate 445-3.25*265=16.25 minutes to finally find his car.\n\nSo the final answer 445-80=365 minutes.\n\nInput: A carnival game has 100", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "1. The question is asking how many times Jack's basket is equivalent to the number of apples in Jill's basket, and we can get to this answer either way.\n2. Let us start with Jill's basket which is assumed to be twice as big as Jack's. The current number of apples in Jack's basket is assumed to be '4', so in Jill's full basket, it could be a total of '2x12=24'.\n3. We can get to this answer by assuming a full Jack's bucket, but without the current four apples in it. The current number of 4 apples that are there can be accommodated by assuming it to be the same as that of the empty Jack's basket, which is given as '12'.  Therefore '12 can accomodate 4 apples' i.e '4 can fit into Jill' basket'.\n4. To get the answer in the form of full Jill's and Jack's baskets, we can reverse the logic as 'Jill' basket can accomodate '24' apples, and 'Jack's' bucket can accommodate '24', so the 'number of times the current number of apples can be accommodated in Jack's basket' is 'Jack's basket can accommodate the current number of appels and the number of times the current number appels are accommodated in Jill' basket' is also the same i.e '24' times.\nSo the final answers are 24X4=96.\n\nInput: If X is defined as a group of all numbers that are multiples of the number Pi, what is the square root of X?

The first variable 4/1 (4/12) is a larger number of variable 3/1 (3/12). Therefore, variable x or 3/1 must be positive. Since 4/1(=4/12(=4/3)) is not positive (and greater than 3), we can eliminate the larger number of variables 4/1.\n5.

{"text": "1) First, it is essential to understand the structure of the task. There are two statements that need to be converted to formulae in order to solve this problem.\n2) The first statement has two equations, and the second statement has only one equation, so the work will be divided into two parts.\n3) The equation in the first statement is: \u2018Karen\u2019s work bag is twice the weight Kevin\u2019s briefcase is when Kevin\u2019s briefcase it is empty\u2019. This can be written as: K + 2K = 2K\n4) Now consider the second statement. Here, Kevin\u2019s briefcase contains Kevin\u2019s laptop and work papers, and the work load of the laptop is 6th of the work load of the briefcase. This information can be represented as: 6K = 2K + C\n5) Let us consider the work equation in the second statement as C=L, so that the full statement can be represented as: L = (2K) / (6) = 2/3 K.\n6) Next, substitute the work equation of the first statement into the work equation of the second statement: 2/3 K + 2K= 2/3 K\n7) Therefore, the full final form of the statement is: 3/3 K = 2K.\n8) Substitute the given variables to solve the equation for the final answer: ((3L/3) / 3K = 2K)\n9) The variable L is only known from the given word-of-practice. We can set up the conversion by substituting a known value in its place, taking the given variable C.\n10) From our previous notes, we know that the formula for the weight of a bag or container is as follows: M = L + I = W\n11) For our example, we have substituted C for the L which was previously unknown and L for the given variable C. We can rewrite the full statement as the following: M = K + I\n12) Now, set the given variables to 0 (0 K and 0 I) to get the final formula for the question: K + K = 2K Therefore, the final answer is 0.", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "1 The given scenario is about how many nights it will take for 5 crackers to last Chad as described, but it is not told when each night is, whether it is consecutive or not, or the duration of each night.\n2. For this, let's assume that each night is one day, without saying what a day means for this scenario, i.e: whether it's the number of working hours, the duration of a particular period, or something else.\n3. Then, we need to find out how many days it takes for 5 boxes of cracked to last Chad.\nTo help us find this out, let us denote the number of days it takes 5 boxes to last Chad as X.\n4. The number of crackers Chad gets every night is: 5 crackers a night = 5 boxes a night. So, 5 boxes of crackors gives Chad 5 * 5 =25 crackers for 5 nights.\n5. Then, 25 crackers come to 1 sleeve a night. However, there are 4 sleeves in a box of crackers so 1 sleeve comes to 4 sleeves a night. Therefore, there is enough for 1 sleeve every night.\n6. Let's denote the number of sleeves per night as Y.\n7. A box of crackers is 5 nights' supply and to last 5 nights requires each box to be able to supply 1 sleeve for each night. Therefore, for 5 boxes it last 5 nights. \n8. So, we have to solve the Equation: X = 5, which has the variable X and value is 5. So, X = 5 since each box of crackers is lasting 5 nights. For this night, there are Y sleeves, as required.\n9. Now, we repeat this process for the following night, which is Y >1 sleeve. So for it to be Y > 1 sleeve, X > 5 i.e. X is greater than 5.\n10.

Now, consider that 2 ounces of the drinks contain 280 gr more caffeine than the first drink.\n6. As a result, we can calculate the total caffeine a cup of the drink contains by taking the caffeines of the drinks. So how much does that cup(12 oz) weigh?\n7. Taking a cup of each, the amount of caffeine inside the cup is 12 gr + 8960x32 - 280.\n8. Now, we can solve for the total number of grams in the cup.\n9.

Assuming that Tanya bought 0 plums, we can infer that she bought fruit whose cost was at least Rs.100, since if plums were any cheaper than Rs.10 per piece, the grocer would have sold her more of it to lower the overall cost of the fruit in the bag.  Similarly, buying Rs.500 worth of fruit would still be cheaper than buying Rs.400 worth of fruit and buying 2 plums separately.  This means that we can eliminate the option (a).\n4. Further, we notice that buying Rs.10 plums are a better option than buying Rs 500 fruit, since the cost of fruit is not evenly distributed amongst the remaining fruit in the bag.  \n5.

{"text": "1) If Joey got eight votes then, based on the information given, Marcy probably got 13 votes and Barry got seven. 2) This means Marcy got 13 + (3 x 7) = 48 votes and Barry got 7 + 2(14) = 20 votes. So, by adding these two numbers together, we can deduct that the total votes for all three candidates were 48+20+8 = 76. 3) The given information indicates that 13 + 48 = 61 and then 20 + 24 = 44. The total number of votes required for all the candidates is 61 + 44 = 105; 61 + 20 + 8(14 14) + 44, where 14 is the number of votes that Joey received.\nSo, Marcy got 48 and Barry was a distant second in the voting with 20, then Joey was in the middle with 24, with the remaining 21 votes.

{"text": "1. First, we need to clearly identify the problem asked to eliminate options.\n2. Since this problem asks to find the speed of a car, we can exclude the options Dale owns(B) sports, as this does not make sense.\n3. The question is clearly stated and asks to find the speed (mph). So, options A, C, F cannot be correct. Only options B and E are related to the question.\n4. Then, we must determine the speed of one car. Since the question is in miles per hour, we can rule out F(16mph) from our calculations.\n5. First, we know that the red sports car can travel at twice the speeds of the green sports car. In this case, we can say that the red one travels at 2x mph, or a speed of 4 mp/h. Next, we know that the green sports car can travel 8, or 8x mph, or 8x4=32 mph. \n6. Now that we have two mph rates, we need to determine the third one, using the information of how the yellow one can travel at speed 0 (which means not at any speed). Thus, we can say that it travels at about 0 mph, which is in fact slower than the green one, so the third, or blue sports car travels a speed of 2x(32 mph)= 64 mph.\n7. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of each sports car and use these to calculate the final one. So, with speed of red=4 mph, green=32 mph, and blue=64 mph, the red car travels a speed equivalent to 4+32=36 mph. \n8. So, the final answer is B.

The answer indicates the number of types of pies eaten without a fork as 1140. Then the total number of types of pie is 2000.\n\nTherefore, to understand the answer completely I can only say that my answer is correct but the answer is not fully valid.\nSo the final conclusion is that 1140 is not the number of pies that are not ate with forks.\nIf there were 2000 pie types, then the question asked about only 1140 pie types.\n\nI could understand if the answer was only 114 because 2000 is the total number of pie types and 2000/2 = 1000 pie types eaten with fork.\n\nSo 1000 + 1140 = 2140 pie types eaten using a fork and the remaining 860 pie types are not eaten with fork. So, to some extent, my answer is valid.", "answer": " 640"}

{"text": "1. The question states that Jessica has one hour to complete an exam, so this leaves us with an 80:16 ratio, or an 80-minute exam reduced to 16 minutes.\n2. Furthermore, we know that Jessica has used 12 of the allotted 80 minutes.\n3. The question then asks how many minutes will be used when the exam is finished. The only possibility to compare and see where that leaves us has to do with how long it takes to answer each question.  If that is the case, we know an answer that would be possible for each question. The question states that 16 of the questions were answered in 12 minutes, which means that 2 minutes and 45 seconds per question.\n4. From this, we know that each remaining question (and the ones Jessica still needs to answer) will take roughly the same amount of time.\n5. We can use this to create an equation. 80-16=x, so x =64. Sixteen questions took 12 minutes out of the hour. 12 divided by 16 = 0.75, and 1/0.75 = 1+3/4. Therefore, each remaining question takes, one and three fourths out of the total.\n6. To solve for the total, we can add all the answers together. Jessica has finished 16 questions, so 1/0.8 = +62, so total is 66+62=128.

{"text": "1) We need to figure out how many bottles Jose can have after he's thrown a party.\n2)  After the party, 3/12 of his total bottles will remain in the cellar.\n3) We know that the amount of wine left in the cellar must equal the amount of wine used during the party. The 3/12 bottles corresponds to 1/8th of the total bottles.\n4) Thus, let's say Jose started with 6/12 of bottles in his cellar, or 1/2 of his total bottle count.\n5) We have to figure out how many party bottles equal to 3/12.\n6) If 3/12 = 2/12 of total wine, it equals 4/12 of the total bottles used. So, 4 bottles will be used during the party.\n7) This means after throwing a party, Jose will have 5/12 of his bottles left which corresponds to 1/6 of total bottles in his cellars\n8) Total wine after the party is (6/12) + (4/12) = 10/12 of total bottles or 10 bottles left in the cellar. Since, 1/2 of the total bottle count = 30 bottles, out of a total 48 bottles, 10 bottles remain in the cellar after the party.\nSo the final answered is A:10", "answer": " 2400"}

{"text": "1. In 2008, the study referred to in the question states that children spend approximately 45 minutes watching television each day.\n2. We are required to determine how many hours this translates to over the course of 2 weeks if the children are allowed to watch 4 days of the week.\n3. To determine answers to a question like this, we first need to determine the formula to transform time into the equivalent of hours, minutes and seconds. In this situation, we can use the formula 24 hours = 1 day. \n4. So, 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds.\n5. Applying that formula to the part of the question where we were required to convert hours into days, we have:\n6. 45 minutes / 60 minutes =  0.75 / 60 minutes\n7. 0.75 x 24 hours =10.5 hours \n8. Therefore, the children will have spent 10.5 hours each day watching television over the 2 weeks time period. \n9. We can then determine how many hours they will have spent watching television over 2 weeks by multiplying 10.5 x 2, which yields 21 hours.\n10. Therefore, in total, these children watch approximately 21 hours of television a week if they are allowed to do so for 4 days during the week.\nSo the final Answer is 21 hours\n\nInput: On average, a person uses about 50 gallons of gasoline driving to and from work each week.

Let's say the price of the first job with three sinks and three toilets is $120 and the price of the second job with 2 sinks, 5 toilets and one shower is $150.\n4) We can see how much more money you can make in a given job by subtracting the price from the price of a similar job. So, Option 1 will give you a profit of $70 and Option 2 will give you a profit (subtracted from your loss) of $100. Hence, the plumber will make more money in Option 1. \nSo the final answer:The plumber will make the most money if he chooses job 1, since job 1 pays him $70 more than the other options.\n\nInput: Which of these items is used as an ingredient in chocolate chip cookies?

Answer: 1. First, we'll observe that the question is in reference to going without sleeping for a length of time, so the answer should be a number of days, rather than minutes or hours. 2. We'll consider the maximum amount an adult can be said to sleep at any given time; at most, an adult can sleep up to 8 hours (which is a total of 480 minutes). 3. With this in mind, we can infer that the maximum amount an adult could go without sleeping for is 3 days (which is a total number of 1.08 hours). 4. In this case, our result (1.08 hours) is less than our original question (a given number of days), so our response is a value closer to zero. 5. For simplicity, let's assume that we are taking a more precise look at a range, and can provide the appropriate range of values (and their number of occurances). 6. In this case, we can determine the value of 1 day, which is a total of 24 hours (480/20). The value of 2 days is 48 hours (a total of 960 minutes), and the value of 3 days is 72 hours (a total of\n\n436 minutes). 7.

{"text": "1) At first the question seems to involve the bicycle having a mix of three different numbers/amounts for spokes. After a moment we realize that all the spokes have one of the following numbers: 20 spokes front wheel, 10 spokes back wheel and half the number front/back(number of spokes on front wheel / 2), or 10 spokes front wheel and half the same front/back(number/2).\n\n\n\n2) A question may involve certain mathematical concepts and expressions, which have a unique way to be evaluated and to arrive at the appropriate answer. Based on 1), the question can be interpreted in two ways: (a) there are 60 spokes, and (b) there are 50 spokes.\n3) If the question is to be interpreted to denote the only possible option: 60 spokes(a), then we can use the principle of mathematical expressions to add all the numbers of spokes represented in all the options of the question to see if the total adds up to 60 spokes. So, 60(40 and 30) + 60 = 60. The answer is 60 spokes.(2)\n4) To derive number 50 spokes(b), we use the same principle of adding numbers. So, 50(30 and 20) + 50 = 50. This derivation helps us understand that the question is not necessarily asking for only one combination of spokes, but for any or all the possible solutions that might be possible, based on the options given in the question options and mathematical representation used to interpret answers.

There are a few mathematical steps. 0.5 is 50% so it is one half of the foot. 10/12 is 8.3% which gives that 10ft of the house is 12% of a foot.\n4. 12 ft is 8 feet and 4 inches.\n5. The second portion we have is '4ft 6in'. So the square footage of the porch would be 4 ft times 4 ft or 16 feet squared.\n6.

{"text": "1) The question asks how many miles a person runs while watching movies and using a treadmill.\n2) Based on this information, firstly we can eliminate one of the choices, 'A: 40 miles' because a movie is an average of 1.5 and two movies are 1.5 plus one. That's only three movies and that is not how many miles we are looking for. The question is how many miles do we run when we watch two movies.\n3) We can eliminate another few choices, 'B: 24 miles' or 'C: 18 miles' because the question is about watching movies so we don't need to include the time to watch movies, the question is only about the distance that we cover during our use of the treadmill. We can eliminate those because they include the running time.\n4) The answer for this is D: 24 miles. The only choice left is 'D: 24 miles'. You can also say that he runs 48 miles if you use the information he runs a mile in 1 minute. But for simplification's sake, we will only state the answer for 24 miles.\nSo the final result/answer is D: 20 miles\n\nInput: How many students need to be recruited for the math club to equal 450 students?  Choices:  A) 210 students  B) 300 students  C) 340 students   D) 450 students  E) 480 students  \nOutput: 1.) The question asks the number of students that are needed to equal 455 students\n2.) We can cross off choices A:210 students and B: 300 students. This is because they are greater than the answer (340 students). It is not required to exceed the number we are trying to equal.\n3.)We can choose our answer from the remaining C: 340 students and D: 450 students. The answer is C: 349 students because 450/10 = 45/2 = 22.5 which rounds to 23 students. Because 340 is a round number we then need to subtract one from the answer to leave ourselves 22 students short.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "1) The information given is all from Grace's landscaping business. So the answers must all be in relation to that.\n2) Based on the provided charges, there is no hourly sum listed that covers the task of 'pulling weeds'.\n3) Because the numbers 6, 9 and 11 are all in multiples of 3, they could all be related to pulling weeds and not directly to the question asked. One possible explanation is that 2/3 of each hour is spent pulling weeds and this accounts for the 9 hours in the total.\n4) Because the sum of 63 + 9 +10 = 82, we could conclude that Grace mowed lawns, pulled weeds and put down mulch each for 82 hours in September. This answers the question directly but it is also extremely unlikely.\n5) This means that we cannot rely on mathematical reasoning to identify the specific hourly sum for pulling weeds. However, the only hours listed for putting down mulch and mowing lawn are 10 and 63.\n6) Using these data points, we can find that the sum of the hourly charges for mowing laww and putting down mulch add up to $67 (=10*6 + 60*9).\n7) These sums are directly related to the question asked in the previous paragraph. This could mean that those total hours spent mowing lawn and putting down mulch was 67 hours in September.\n8) Combining this data with the fact that Grace spent 9 hours pulling weeds, it can be inferred that these three tasks were completed every hour in September and there were no other landscaping tasks in Grace's schedule other than those she has listed.\n9) There was no other information given to suggest otherwise and no other evidence that Grace had multiple landscaping tasks during September. Given this, we can conclude that there were no other landcaping tasks performed.\n10) There is also one final piece of supporting evidence that the above assumptions are correct. The total number of hours in the month for Grace to have been able to pull 63 lawn in 1 week must have been higher than 11 hours (the hours listed for pulling weed).

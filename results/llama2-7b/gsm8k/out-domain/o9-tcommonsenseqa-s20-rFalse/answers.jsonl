{"text": "4\n\nInput:It's very expensive to keep up your car. Your car tires are very important for safety. Your car has four tires.  Each tire is different size.  Your passenger car has front tires the size 235/55R14 92H XL, back tires the size 165/60R14 81H T, and there is an option to choose either a 14-16 inch wheel or a 17-19 inch wheel.  The average tire price is different for each size.  Your passenger tire manufacturer offers you a special price. Each car tire, when it is bought from a dealership or tire brand store , costs the same amount more or less than the same brand car tire bought from an individual.  If the price is the same, the tire may be a different quality, not for the same model or brand of the car, but a close match. An individual buying tires from a dealership may qualify for the discount. Your passenger tire manufacturing company has a special deal for individuals. Your passenger tire dealership can sell your car tires for 36% off MSRP (manufacturer suggested retail price) or they can sell your tires for a special price. The price is different for each type of tires and you may qualify for any discount on any of your 4 car tires. The prices for your tires are as follows: 14-15 inch tires cost $197.00, 16-17 inch tires cost more, $302.50 and 18-19 inch tires cost most, $526.00.   When you buy from dealership/ brand store   Your passenger car tires costs you $281.25 each tire, plus the additional dealer's fees if you qualify.  Your passenger car tires cost you $215.00 each tire when you buy from an individual.

{"text": "Answer: 32\n\n### Instruction:Answer the first question.\n\ninput: 23 60 - 10 = output : 53\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. In case you don't already know, here's how to solve for something like X. First of all we know X must be between 23 and 60, since X can't be < 23 nor > 60 (if we can, we can just subtract one of them, since they're numbers at the same position). So, for X, we start at 23 and go to 60. That's 60 less 23 as I'll show below (the sum of the two numbers):\n\n1. Now we know that we want to find X, but we need a number to subtract from. For that, we take X from the equation and we subtract 60 from it(X - 60):\n\n2. So we know that 60 less 60 is 0, so we add it to the previous number 1, which we got from the last step: 0 + 1 = 1 and since we need a different number, we repeat: 0 + 2 = 2, 0 + 3 = 3, and so on:\n3. Now, we know X from the 60-23-X=10 = 10 = 0 + 10 = 1\nOutput: 23 + 10= 33 \n\n### Instuctions:\n1. the difference between the 2 numbers.\n2. find the difference between the two numbers.\n3. output: 20, 20+20=10. \n\n###Instuctions:\n1) write the sum = 85,15,2,0. \n\n2)sum = 93,15,20,2,0.\n\n3)sum =13\n\n###Instructions:\n1) sum of the odd numbers 1,3,5,...53.\n\n2) sum of the prime numbers 2,3,5,7,..\n\n3) sum of divisors = 66.\n\n4)sum of", "answer": " 60"}

If she were reading it with the dictionary, that would help, but how would she know where to look in the dictionary?\n\n#### Solutions\n1.  Start by determining the type of washing machine.  \n2.  There are two types of washing machine, agitator and non-agitator.  \n3.  Cassandra's washing machine may or may not have an agitator.  If there is an agitator,  then unpack and remove it.  If there is no agitator, then start Step 6.  \n4.  Determine if it is a gas or electric washing machine.  5.  If gas, Cassandra needs to look in the gas dictionary.  6.  If electric, she needs to look in the electic dictionary.  \n7.  Cassandra needs to check if the water hookup is connected to the washing machine.  8.  If yes, then her water hookup will be found in the plumbing dictionary.  9.  If no, then her water hook up will most likely be in the electric dictionary.  \n10.  Cassandra needs the instructions to install the washing machine because she doesn't know how it's supposed to be packed.  \n11.  If the washing machine has an agitator, Cassandra can find her instructions to install the water hook up here in this dictionary because it's in the washing machine dictionary.  \n12.  If the washer doesn't have an agitator, then it must be a \"spin dry\" washing machine.  This type of washing machine is found in the spin dry dictionary.  \n13.  If the washater isn't in either the washing machine, plumbing, or spin dry dictionary  Cassandra should try the water hookup dictionary or the electic dictionary, and if that isnt't it,   then it's the gas dictionary.", "answer": " 370"}

Every time we encounter a number in the sequence, we append that element to that array, but if we already have that element in the array, we will remove the last ( or the first, however we encounter it first) so that we can fit one extra element on the array, and we only keep M elements on the array.  \n\nWhen we loop through the sequence again (or a part of it) we do the same thing, we only keep M elements. But we need to make sure that every number in the array is repeated N times. That's why we're getting the count of how many times every value that's in the sequence got inserted on the array. And at the end we compare between them to make sure every value in the sequence will be seen on the array M times( or the equivalent).    \n\n\n### Note:\nThe answer for the test is correct, but the time complexity was inefficient, in the real coding contest I used a better solution.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThis is my final submission: [LeetCode Gap][1]\n![](/assets/2-Solution.png)\n[1]:https://leetcode.com/gamble_jones_02/details/359733861?current_test_id=359734046", "answer": " 5"}

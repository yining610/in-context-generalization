C: The fox jumped. D: The dog's tail is foaming.\n\n### Correct:D\n\n### Exposition:\nDog can't be a porker and have a tail, because then the dog would be two different animals.\n\n### Input:\\*What can you use to stop the fire?\n\n### Reply:A dish of water, a bucket of sand, a pail of gasoline, or a bucketload of coal\n\n### Expanse:\nIf you throw a bucket of water outside, the fire will be extinguished. Coal, oil, sand, and gasoline are not going to stop the fire and will probably cause the fire to grow.\n\n### Immortalization:\nA bucket full of coal will not be enough to keep the fire burning, because we are not adding enough fuel to it. The coal is needed to replace the ones been burning.\n\n### A dish is not considered a bucketload(enough fuel), there is no pail, the term 'pail' is an insult. So the dish needs to be filled not a bucketload, it's not as heavy and more liquids needed, hence gasoline would extinguish easily.\n\n### Fuel:A pail of gasoline will not keep a fire alive, the flames will go out and burned gas will not cause a fire.\n\n### Exonerate:\nThe oil was thrown on the fire it stopped, but the sand and coal were placed in a pail full of water, it just made it wet and would not stop the fire.\n\n## Explanation:\nThe oil was being thrown on the fire and was quenching it because oil is water", "answer": " 36"}

How many packages are processet by the second distribution center\n\nThe question then asks the combination of the two. \n\nTo answer this, I broke everything into categories:\n\nfirst distribution center: 1,0010\n\nsecond distribution center: 3001-6000\n\nThe final outcome is $5 per package:\n\n1,001 x $5/package = $1500\n\nThen we add those two totals to figure out the final team: \n\n1,3001 x $2/package = $26001\n\nThat is $41,001 total as a team.\n\n### Future Applications\n\nFor the future, I think this type of question is very useful to be able to answer if I were to run into a problem where something needs to be quickly calculated for the purpose of making an impact.  Sometimes, you have to be quick on the draw and come up with the answer, which if you can solve problems in this manner, you will be much better off.", "answer": " 14000"}

Robi keeps alternating the on and off of the water supply, but the amount of water loss is too high to fill the tub. Let  x be the volume of the out flow from the tub once Robi begins using the tap for filling the tub. As the time goes on, the total volume, Vtub (in liters) of water in the tub, keeps getting larger.\n\nVtub = [1 + (0.5 + 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.05) x]\n\nAt the same time, Vtap (in liters) keeps decreasing as the tap is on while the tub is not being filled and when it is being filled in.\nVtap = [1 + (1 - 12 + 1 ) x] = 1 - 15 x\n\nDividing these two equations we get:\n\nVtap - Vtub= 30 - (x-0.5)\n\nFor X >= 0.5. So, for water to fill tub, X has to be greater than or equal to 0.5.\n\nIf X = 2 liters, then 0.5L would be out due to inefficiency of cap and 1.5L would be left in tub.\n\nSo, Robi would have to fill the tub from 0.5L water. Now, Robi would have done it 4 X [ (0.5 - 0.5) ] times before he actually manages to fill the tub.\n\nSo total time = total water (4X[(0.5 -0.5)]) - 0.5 = (4X[(0 - 0.5)] ) = X*4 = 4X so, total time = 4.", "answer": " 24"}

It can be assumed that the question implies that for every 24-hour period he sleeps for four hours, and during all other hours he is awake and not sleeping. Therefore, it can be considered without loss of generality that a man needs 6 hours of sleep. The question becomes: if a man needs 6 hour of sleep, how many days can he work without sleeping? The answer is, 3 days. To prove this, it must be assumed that on days he works he needs no sleep. After 6 days a man needs 6 + (6 hours per day needed) = 36 hours of sleep, and 4 days will be left in which he can get that needed sleep.\n\n# Challenge\nThis is an example of the type of questions you are expected to solve in the challenge.\n\n### Challenge:\n\nThere is a machine that can count a given number of items from a set A.

Therefore 2 litres contain 400 ml of salt (because of the 1/2 ). 400 mls of salt, out of a bucket that contained 2000ml of salt, gives us 20ml of salt left after all the water evaporated.\n\n![](images/output6.png)", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "140 bananas would be each monkey's share\n\n### Justification:\nThere are 14 hands for the first 6 piles and 140 total bananas in these 6 piles. The remaining 4 piles contain 12 hands and 90 bananas. So 12 piles with 14 hands contain 140 banana for each hand because there are 14 bananas each. Add those to 90 bananas for the 12 hand in the 4 piles, you would have 230 bananas for 14 hands  The first pile contains 90 bananas, which is 12 hand with 9 bananas. So 91 banana are for 1 hand  For 6 piles with 12 hands, divide 160 bananas by 12 hands 160/12 = 13.333 Banana per hand, so each first pile would have 12 (9 + 1) 21 bananas.   So 4 piles is equal to 12, which is 2x12 = 24 bananas for 1 hand. So there are 14x2x92 = 1436 bananas divided by 12 = 120.5 banana per hand.  For the 12 piles, there 120.64 banana (for the ones that had more bananas) and 120.46 banana (for the remaining 12 piles) So 120.26 banana are given per hand\n\n***\n\n#### [Exercises](https://edugen.io/course/1?lesson_id=35)", "answer": " 99"}

How much is the package worth?\n\n### Demostration  \n\nTotal weight: 8 X 16oz (1 lb=16oz) = 128oz. \n\nSince each pound of cornsyrup is.15 each there are 8 packeges x $1.125 each = $9. At $1.12.5 per lb of corn syrup and with 32 packeges there is 32 times $1.12.15 = $.4. So the total weighted cost is $9 + $.4 = $9.4. So the total cost is$9.4\n\n\n### Question: What is the weighted cost? \n\n### Answer:\nSince the weighted cost is $10.4 and the total cost is $9.4, the difference is $.5.

For every ant born, which of the following is true? Choices: 1. Somebody dies 2. Somebody is born 3. Somebody is old 4. An ant is young The answer is 3.\n\nInput: In a school where you have two types of class and two hours for each class, how many hours is it when you have class one hour and play two-hours-long soccer for three consecutive days?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe answer is 36 hours, because you have 4 classes in a school year, 36 classes * 2 hours long, so one hour in a class is half a class. Therefore, 2 hours for the school year would be 40 classes. And 40 classes divided by 36 classes is 1.09375. That's 23 hours rounded up. You play 2-hours-long sports with no breaks for the whole school year, which is 40 classes * 2 hours = 80 hours, so 80 hours less the 23 hours we subtracted leaves us with 57 hours. That's 57 hours divided by 4 classes, which equals 14.25. 14 hours and 25 minutes is 14 hours and a quarter, which I'll round up to 14 and 3/4. 14 and 1/4, which I'll also be rounding up, is 14 and 2/4. 15 hours, which I will not be rounding, is 15 and 2/4 hours. 15 2/4 hours is 15 hours and 4/4 hour, which comes out as 15 hours. 15 hours more or less 5 hours, because 5 hours is half a class hour.

{"text": "This problem can be represented using 3,4, and 5.  The number of votes Joey received is 3, twice as many as Joey's total votes is 6, and 3 times as many as 1 more than the total votes is 9. This means that Marcy got 9,0, and 6 votes, respectively. However, 6 is not the same as 3 times as many votes as 2 times as many votes. The key here is that we know that Marcy got twice as many votes as 3 more than another number. We can use the equation 3 X (n + 2) to figure out how many votes could have gotten. 3 times n plus 2 is 6, and if our original amount equals 8, then n = 5. From there, we plug those numbers into the equation and solve: 3 X 5 + 2 = 8, so n = 5.\n\n### Input2: What is the area of a circle that is 5 inches in diameter?\n\n### Demotion: The area of a circle that has a diameter of 5 inches is equal to the number pi multiplied by the square of the diameter, and the square of the diameter is equal to the diameter (d) multiplied by the diameter (d). This simplifies our equation to: pi X (diameter)\u00b2. We can plug our numbers in, leaving only one unknown. 5 * 4 = 20 so d = 20. Our expression now becomes (\u03c0) X (20)\u00b2. Plugging in our values, we get (\u03c0) X (400)\u00b2 = 3.14 X (8000). This simplifies to 3.14 = 400. As it turns out, the value of pi is equal to 3.1. Therefore, the area of a circle with a five inch diameter is 3.1, or 3.1 X 2.5 = 7.85 square inches.\n\n### Inroduction: The only number larger than 9999 is???\n\n### Democation: The only 4 digit number that is bigger than 999 is 1098 (999+9+9+8=1098)\n\n### Instructions", "answer": " 66"}

{"text": "Makenna has 105 chocolate bars to sell. Out of these she has 25 milk chocholate bars, 29 dark chocolate bars and 27 milk with almond bars. The percentage of each chocolate bar is 25%, 24.2% and 26.1%.\n### Explain:\n\nOutput:\n\nIn order to calculate the percentage of each type, one must first write down the values for each type. In this case, there are 5 different types. For each type there must be at least one value. \nFor instance, there are 25 bars of milk chocolate (the minimum amount). Similarly, there are 29 bars of dark chocolate. Each bar of chocolate is worth a dollar, meaning that Makenna made a profit of 1700+1405+1789+2095 = 7, 077.50 from this sale. \nTo find the percentage, divide the amount by the number of bars. There are a total of 105 chcolate bars, and each type makes up a specific area of the total. For example, milk chocolate is 25%, which is the same area that milk chocolate makes up. Dark chocolate is 18.7%. A combination of a different two (milk and dark) is 26.1%, and the last category, white chocolate is 6.2%. These represent the percentages.", "answer": " 25"}

Blue marbles (20 times 3) = Green Marbles (60 marbles, 30%) 3. Yellow marbles, the rest (60%) 4.

The time to travel is 12 minutes.\n\n### Response\n\nI would use a subtotal to add together all of the cost ($2) for transportation plus the time to travel ($0.25).  The product of both subtotals would give you a final result of $52.80 (800 X $2.00, and 800 X.25 = $52.82).\n\n### Comment\n\nThe cost of the transportation is always double - but the time takes into account the round trip.\n\n### Input\n\nThe formula for the time to get the car serviced is 560 - (2/10) + ((65 / 2)) - (0.25) where: 560 = time for the car to be in the shop, 2/10 = time for the oil change, (65 / 2) = time for other maintenance, and 0.25 = time for the diagnostic check.

So if they travel 300miles then it  take more than double of the time so it is 300*2=600 miles.\n\n### You can help people save.\n\n### Demo input \nIf A is the opposite of B and B is the opposite of C, what is A?\n\n### \nThe correct answer to this problem is C.", "answer": " 290"}

{"text": "There are a total of 70 fruits, made up of 10 papaya fruits and 20 mango fruits.\n\n### Notes:\n- To successfully solve this, think logically about the question. Break down what is being asked. In this case, it's something like: given the number of fruits that Santino has on a per papaya basis and on a per mango basis, what is the total number in all. Think about what it means for each fruit type to give a specific number per each and the total of all the ones on the per type is the answer. It's a little confusing at first, but it starts to make more sense once this is established.\n- When writing code, this can be simulated in the sense that an object containing an integer value representing each type of fruit can be used. In each iteration, a certain fruit will be chosen from this object and a variable will be made to keep track of how many copies of that fruit are produced in total. The key value is that once it is determined that all of the fruit has been chosen from the object, the sum of all of them in this variable is the answer.\n\n### Link to practice:https://www.uriv.org/t/jameshernandezhernandez3#47", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "I understand that Jasper is having a dinner party so he decided to get three different types of ingredients for it, and I believe that Jasper is only getting one of the ingredients in larger quantities because that isn't necessarily how much it is going to be used. I will calculate the amount of cheese that he plans on using for the dinner, and based on that calculation I will determine the amount of money that is needed for the ingredients that he has purchased.\n\nTo start with, based on the information given so far I will know that Jasper plans on serving 1 pound more of his cream cheese than he does the cheddar cheeses, so that he can split the charcuterie equally with his guests (1 pound of each). This means that he will spend 33% of his total budget (roughly $3.333) on the cheddar cheesses, 10% of his total budget on his cream cheeses, and the rest on the other ingredients.\n\nNext, I will calculate how much extra meat that he will need. I know that he is buying double the meat that the cheddar chees, so I will divide 2 by 2.5 (the weight of the cold cuts compared to the weight of the cheddar) to figure out how many pounds of meat he will need. Assuming he's serving about 10 guests, he will also need to buy an extra 0.4 pounds of meat, which means he will need to spend and additional $4.80 (rounding it to the nearest dollar).\n\nAdding up what I found above will tell me how much Jasper is spending. He will spend $3.33 + 0.48 + $3.33 = 7 $7.14\n\n### InputThe machine was very intricate and expensive, it was quite an investment.\n\n###  Demonstration: What is the missing word?\n\nInput: In the beginning of 1990, scientists have not yet been able to clone anything other than dogs.

{"text": "After seeing the display of a school-wide art contest, the principal of a middle school was inspired to teach students the artistic process, as well as the value of an open mind and an appreciation for other work from your peers.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe start with a total of 94 clownfish and 94 blowfish. The principal splits the clownfish evenly between the two pools (52 each).  This leaves 64 clownfish in the first pool. Then she moves 50 of these over, which is 50 out of 64 (or an equal 31 out of 100).\n\n### Expected Response:Answer: 12\n\n### Demanding Explanation:\nEach clownfish is placed into 1 of 94 tanks, in a 1:94 ratio. This is a 100% efficiency task.\nA clownfish's next location will be into a tank with a 1/94 ratio of blowfish, if it doesn't get randomly chosen to put into the exhibition tank.\nThe exhibition tank has tanks which consist of a 100/94 ratio of clownfish to blowfish.  So, by dividing 100/456 and then multiplying by 10, clownfish are 6.25 times more likely to end up in the exhibiton tank.\nTo get the correct answer you multiply the ratios by 12, and then divide by 20 for each location, which results in 28 clownfish in tanks, 64 in the exhibiton tanks, and 34 in the outside tanks.\n\n100 - 62 - 28 = 12 - 64 - 34\n\n100 / 45 = 22 - 64 / 20 = 62\n\n62 * 12 = 748 - 748 * 12 =24 * 12 = -34\n\nTo solve for clown fish in tanks, you just have to subtract blow fish from tanks and clown fish from tanks so as to get the answer.", "answer": " 16"}

Each game that is in the 20's adds $8,002 to the salary. So, three games in the 20\u2019s is $24,006. The first game in the 30\u2019s is $10,040. In other words, with one game in the 35\u2019s, his weekly salary is $34,046.\n\nThe last game in the 26\u2019s is subtracted, because each game was either 26\u2019s or above. In 26\u2019s, the game was $8,012 per game. So, the 26\u2019th game of the week costs $8,016. \n\nSo, the salary $34,030 = $8,013 + $10,039\n\n### Input How many liters in one gallon?\n\n### Demostration One gallon is equal to 3.785411784 liters\n\n### Response 1 liter is equal to ----- gallon\n\n### Explatation one gallon equals 3.78 liters (3 and 7 and 8 tens times 5 and 4 ones)\n\n### Instructions\nInput: 10000+34205+29504+17997+21182+37307+50100+41508+22904+14548+29084-97543-1361\u00d714862\u00f72.5\u00f7499\u00f7-116.515\u00f7-15.523 \u00f7 -71.5 \u00f7 -17.28-59.6-9.59\u00d7+152\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\n### Demo:\n100+0302+0295+179+0211", "answer": " 10,000"}

Each deck can hold 52 cards, so he needs to have more. To get 52 cards he needs 2 additional full decks. Since John only has 3 of those, he only needs 2 additional half-full decks.

{"text": "9\n\nIf Angelina is 4 years old than Justin is, and Justin is currently 2 years 3 months older than Angelina will be in five year's time we can compute Justin's current age by substituting it with Angelina's current age. Now since Angelina is 2 years 3 month's more aged than Justin's current age from his calculation. Justin is therefore 4+1=5 years old\n\n### Other solution\n\nif we assume Angelina's age then we can solve the problem in this way:  \nIf an agent's age is 2 then we have to take 5th year since angelina(m) is 4then in 1 year that agent can be 1 since it is a constant value if angelina is 2years older than the agent.  \nWe can now multiply our answers by 5\n\n### Demand and Supply\n\nInput: The market for selling ice cream's demand increased the last few years, due to the hot summers for the last few summers.

B: There was not enough clients.  D: There was not enough funding\n\nIf A and B are both happening, we will take those. If both are not happening we will take the D (that is, not enough funding).

{"text": "If the three cats make a total of 5 meows per minute, what is the total in 5 minutes? For example, if the three cats meow 5 minutes total with a duration of 5 minutes each, then the total is 30 meows.\n\nThe combined total of the three cats in 5 minutes could be 24, 60, 120 and 180 respectively. The minimum of all these values is 24, where 60 and 120 only occur at 2.5 and 5 minutes respectively. Likewise, 180 only occurs at a duration of 3 minutes.

Now...  If he spends $1 of his change, he has $3 for his peanuts.  Then that leaves two and half pound of peanuts.  Do you see where this is going?  Now he has $2 left over.  So he takes the same dollar and gives it to the cashier and gets two and half dollars of change and now he has the 2 and half pound of Peanut left over.  He takes the rest of the money that he has and buys four ounces of peanuts with them.  Well  you still have one dollar left over.  Then the he breaks one of the five dollar bills into two fives and gives the cashier one five and gets one one-dollar piece of change.  He takes it and buys the the.8 of a pound peanuts.

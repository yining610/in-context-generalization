Some think that the problem with math is a lack of practice, while others say it's because there is too much to learn.\nOutput:\n1. The data indicates that the number of teenagers answering problem solving items \"below grade level\", which is an indicator of math skills, changed only a little between 1966 and 2012 (~9.18 - 9.31%). For 50 years that is minimal growth or a decline.\n2. Some people think lack of practice is the reason for this lack of growth in math skills.\n3. Others believe the amount of information to learn contributes to that lack of growth.\n4. I believe the problem actually is lack of practice.

It involves the player taking a shot from a distance, usually with the help of a raised platform or basket, and attempting to get the ball through the hoop. This type of scoring requires great skill and accuracy, and is typically the primary goal of basketball players.\nMaking a basket (2) is when the ball goes through the hoop after being shot from the ground level. This is the ultimate goal of the game and is considered a highly challenging and rewarding feat.\nRebounding a shot (3) is when a player returns the ball to the shooter after a missed (or made) shot.\nDribbling past your opponent (4) is when a player handles the ball and moves around a defender in order to advance the ball towards the opponent's basket.\nCatching the ball (5) and scoring is when a player catches the ball and then moves it towards the basket, either for a shot (1) or dribbling past, or for getting an assist (6).", "answer": " 50"}

So far she has bought 16 chocolates by the 8th of the month. She buys 2 every saturday.\n4. The only way she can buy more chocolates in a month is to not stick by her standard monthly purchase. This may be because of some special occasion such as her birthday or Charlie's birthday.\n5. So, 16 + her special occasion would allow her to break the pattern she has previously established. \n6. Based on the information we have, there is no other way she can buy more than the standard 16 chocolate unless there are special occasions.\n7. Thus by process of elimination we can determine 16 is the answer:  the number of chocolate Kantana bought for the month is 16.\nSo the final output is 16 chocoles.\n\nInput: I bought one loaf of bread and two lamb chops last week. How many pounds of meat and vegetables did I buy?\nOutput: 1:  This question seeks to determine the final pounds of meat and vegetable purchases.\n2. The meat and bread purchases fall under the category of meat and vegetable purchase. Since meat and lamb are both considered meat products, we can therefore answer meat and Lamb for meat and vegetable option.\n3. Lamb is considered by quantity to be equivalent to one.\n4. That leaves one option for us.\n5. Bread is an equivalent category compared to one for meat and bread.\n6. Bread is not considered meat in this context, thus is a vegetable.\n7. Thus, one lamb chop is equivalent to one pound of meat (as it does not come under vegetable) for the answer.\n8. Bread is not equivalent to one, as the question is seeking equivalent in pounds, as lamb is considered equal to one, thus 6 in pounds is the equivalent in pound for bread, and not all of 6 pounds of bread.\n9.

The answer choices are 15, 12, 13, 18, 9.\n2. When converting dollar and percentage problems, the easiest choice to begin with, is the final choice.\n\nIn this case, the final choice (9) is not the correct answer.  Thus, we can begin by eliminating the choices and working backwards from the final answer of 9.  This would give us $1.35 as being the starting point.\n\n3. From there, we can proceed by solving a fraction equation to find the dollar amount from 60% of a total.  Here the choices would all have decimal numbers at the end.  \n\n4. Begin by finding a fraction that would fit with 60% of 15.  The key here is to understand that 100% is one whole, which is a number that is divisible by itself, which is equal to one.\n\nYou want to pick two numbers that would get you from 1 to 100% to be equal to a number that is divisive by itself.  In this case, you'd choose 60, the number of percent, and 15, the dollar amount.  To get an exact 60%, you would take (60/100) which is equal to 1/2.  Thus, we could use 1/2 to find the answer for the problem.  Let's say that 2/3 is the answer we would get, then one third is equal to 6/20.  When you multiply and divide both sides by 2, you get 60%.\n\n5. To find the answer, you add the two numbers together.

It is given that Fiona completed 36 questions in one hour, Shirley completed twice as many as Fiona, and Kiana completed one-half the sum of both Fiona and Shirly.\n3. We know 36 questions = 1 hour, so double the number of questions of a single hour = 2x 36 = 72 math questions in that one hour.\n4. Half the sum of Fiona's and Shirley' question = (1/2) (1/2) 36 + 1 = 18 + 1 = 20 math questions. \n5. Kiana does the same as Shirley, but since her math question is half of the sum between the combined questions, she does the same = (1/2)(20) = 10 math questions.\n6.

{"text": "1- A man is driving home from work and trying determine which one of two options to take:  the first option, which has three stoplights, and will take 10 minutes if they stay green.  However, if one of the lights is red, it will increase his trip's duration by 3 minutes at a time.  The second option has no red lights, and will take 5 minutes longer than the first route.\n2-  Let's start by making the following assumptions about the two routes:\n3 - Route 1 = Trip duration = 10 minutes if the lights stay green, but each red light will add 3 minutes.\n4 - Route 2 = Trip duration = Time from stoplights = Trip duration from stoplights + Time to get through stoplights.\n5 - Route 1 = Time with Stoplights is 10 minutes, but the time it takes to pass through each stoplight is not relevant.\n6 - Route 2 = Time with no Stoplights (5 minutes) PLUS Time of Stoplights = Time with Stoplight Traffic + Time getting through this traffic.\n7- I am going to assume for the sake of argument that each stoplight is perfectly synchronized so it does not change during the trip.  Thus, the time with stoplights is 20 minutes (route 2).\n8- Thus, the time with no stoplights = 40 minutes (Route 1)\n\n9- Route 1 (trip duration = time with stoplights + time to get through the stoplights) = (10 minutes) + 3 times (3 minutes) = 16 minutes.\n10- Route 2 (trip duration = trip duration with stoplights + trip duration to get to the stoplights)  = 20 minutes + 1 minutes = 21 minutes.\n11- The time of stoplights with both routes = Route 1 = 36 minutes (3 minutes x 12 stoplights.)\n12- Route 2 = -6 minutes (stoplight duration minus stoplight time duration).\n13- Thus:\n     Trip duration = Route 1 = T 16 minutes + stoplight time = 16 + 36 = 52 minutes\n     Trip duration Route 2 = T", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "1) The question is asking the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the 4th day.\n2) To determine the height for each day after the 1st day, we will subtract the snow the previous day from the amount of snowfall that occured that day. For example, for the 2nd day, if the snow fall was 3 inches, then the new depth for that day would be 28 inches minus 3 inches, which is equal to 25 inches\n3) From day 4, the new depth (34) plus the depth from the previous days, (25, 25, 21) equals 362. Above is a mathematical proof to arrive to this result:\n  * The first day, the depth was 34 inches\n  * The second day, the depth was therefore: 34 inches of snow + 3 inches of new snowfall, which is equal to, \"34 inch of snow + 3 inch of new snowfall\" (34 + 3 = 37)\n  * The next day, the depth was :37 inch of snow + -1 inch of snowfall, which is: 37 inch of new snow fall - 3inch of snowfall from previous day. This equals \"37 inch of fresh snow fall minus 1 inch of old snow fall.\" Let r indicate \"remaining\" snowfall from previous day, it equals: \"37 inch fresh snow fall \u2013 4 = 33 inch fresh snow melt\" (37 = 37 \u2013 4)\n  * On the third day, the depth was: 33 inch snow melt + 6 inch of snowfall\n\n    * In conclusion, each day, the sum of the current depths plus the new snowfall equals the original depth of 34 inches.\n\n      * The depth at the end of the third day = (33 x inches snow melt) +6 inches of new snow fall, which is equal to (33 + 6)\n      * Therefore, the answer to the first day's depth = (34 + 6) inches\n\nOutput: 2): The answer to the question is 28 inches.", "answer": " 20"}

Perhaps this is a trick question? Perhaps the question is asking us how long the gazelle will last before we catch up to it?\n3) We can use some logic to deduce more information to give us the final answer.\n4) We're told that a cheetah can run 60 mph and the gazelle can run 40 mph, giving us that they can travel the same speed.\n5) So, we need the question to tell us what we are trying to find, and that is the time the cheetah need to catch up to the prey.

How many can I boil in 10 minutes? Choices: 1: 30 2:40 3:60 4:30 5: 70\nOutput: 1 There are 5 eggs per one minute. So 5x10=50. There are 52 minutes in an hour.  Therefore, there must be 40 eggs per minute if there are 600 eggs to boil. After 10 minutes, there would be half of the original number of eggs (30) which is 200 eggs. After 20 minutes, 200 x 40 = 8000 eggs in the pot. Therefore, I can only boil 8000 in 20 minutes, I can't boil 6000 or 1000 eggs. I can only boil either 30, 40, 80, or 160 eggs per 10 minutes.\n\nInput:19+y+21+x-y+20+8-9-8y+x-9-8=76\nOutput:2) To begin, the equation is given in mixed order of operations.

After the injurty pain goes away, he wants to wait another 3 weeks before he starts lifting heavy again. It was unclear if he wanted to wait 3 weeks just after the injury pain subsides.  Therefore, this would take 1 week. He then wants to start lifting heavy after 2 weeks. But if he waited 3 weeks instead, he would not need to wait another 2 weeks instead.

{"text": "1. There are two main parameters, perimeter, p, of a square-shapes piece of paper, which is measured in units of cm.\n2. This corresponds to the width, w, and the length, l of the square, as one could represent a square by wx. \n3. The height, h, could be derived given two measurements of perimeter, p, and width, w, as h = w. This is important, because the height of a screen depends on the shape of the rectangle that is used.\n4. The second parameter would then be the height, h of the computer screen.\n5. Then, as per the question, p < h. \n6. Using linear arithmetic to solve for h:  h = w(1+p/w/p)\n7. This can be factored, rearranged and simplified to h = w(1 + 1/w/p) > h > 1 (or 2/w <= 1)\n8. Then, since w > 1, p must equal 1 or less than that, which means that h > 1. or h = p/2.\n9. Now taking this equation and solving for p:  p = h * w. Therefore h / p = w.\n10. We can now substitute p in for w, and plug this into equation 4, replacing p/2, and we have equation 5 h = w(1 / (w + h/2)/(h/2))\n11.

It is clear from the question that there are equal numbers of apples and oranges in the bags.\n3. Thus, bag C must have both apples and oranges.\n4. Similarly, bags are A and B must both contain apples and oranges too. Thus, A & B must have half apples and half oranges each.\n5.

{"text": "The first thing that we need to do is get an expression that we can use to represent the number of cards that Rick has. In addition, we need to understand that this can be rephrased as something that involves addition rather than subtraction.\nFirst, let's understand that he can distribute the cards to his friends (the rest of the cards). He can distribute evenly to each friend and the friend will received 12 cards.\nLet's go ahead and break down Rick's original 130 cards into the number of cards that he will keep, the cards he will give to Miguel and the number of cards he will give each of his 8 different friends (in a group of 12 cards). Based on the prompt, he will keep the following cards: 15 cards -15 cards.\nSo he then gives the remainder of cards to his sisters in an unspecified, yet equatable, manner (since the are \"equal\" to each other). There are 2 sisters that each receive 3 cards.\n\nFor simplicity sake let's just focus on the part that we're not sure about (the number of cards that Rick gave to Miguel).\nThe total number of cards left from the initial 130 cards that he has are : 105. We know that he keeps the following amount: 15 -12 (12 cards distributed to friends).\nThus, Rick's number of cards, after distributing the remaining cards is 88 cards. We can confirm that by multiplying by his original 130, we see that he only has 346 cards with him. So by subtraction, we get 105 - 346 = 88.\n\nFinal outcome is that he gave Miguel the initial amount of cards, but we don't know exactly which cards.\n\nInput: You are buying a book for $7.99, two magazines for $5.49, a CD for $11.61, a DVD for $10.77, and a t-shirt for $9.99.

The average speed will have to do with the distance travelled by the cars, and the time taken for them to get from their starting point to the park.\n5. In order for the cars to get to the parking spot, they need to travel the distance from their starting point to their parking spot.\n6. We can consider all the cars moving the same distance in the same time, say 100 m in 10 min.\n7. This makes the average speed of the cars entering to be 1km/1 hour.=1km/60= 1.7m/s\n8.

For day 2, instead of saying \"fewer songs\" we should instead say that he listened to \"one fewer song\" (because he already heard 9, so 9-1=8). So in the question asked for him to listen to 9 songs in the first day, and one fewer song in the second day, making 8.\n5. By putting the answers together, we get that he listened to 9 today and 1 fewer. This means 1 less than what was heard yesterday.\n6.

Jacob has half of the number of candies that Nellie can eat before crying. Let the number of candies to eat equal N:  12N = 12N/2 = 12N+6  12xN+6 = 12N  12N/12 = 12*N/12, so we have:\nN/12 = N/6, which we can reorganize as 12N = N (thus both sides of the equation are the same)\n4. Lana can eat N-3 candies before they cry. Let the number of sourball candies equal N.\n5. The total of the three people is 138, while the total of the three variables in that equation is 138.

If the length of each side measures 2(992/3) inches, what is the area of the square?\nOutput:1. a square is constructed with sides that measure 8 inches, so the perimeter of the square would be 8. In order to calculate the area of the square, we need to find the perimeter of the box, multiply by 2 on each side, and then subtract 1 (the square inside of the 8 inch square). This gives us 32 + 2(32) - 1 = 32\n2. Next, divide both values by 2 to get 16 + (32/2) - 1/2 = 16 + 16 - 1/2= 15 3/2\n3. In the case where we added 32 + 32/2, the value is (32+32 (1+8/22 = 16)\n\n4.

The boys are far from everybody and the girls are also far from everybody. No improvement is possible.\n\nExample 2: If we start from a point and use 9 children to start a circle, the boys are all next to each other, and the girls are all next to each another. As a consequence, the boys can always give room to another boy and the girls can always give room to anothe girl. The number of children needed can be reduced from 9 to 7 and everyone will be happy and in the circle.\n\nExample 3: Now we start from different points. 9 children are used again and the girls are next to each other again, but the boy are now divided into two groups which are at the long sides of the circle. We can give room to some boys by giving room to a neighbor boy and by moving on. However, the groups are still far away from each other. Again, the necessary number of boys can be reduced by 1 and the circles stays closed.\n\nThe same arguments apply if we start from a different point, if we use 2 boys or girls (in order to make the girls at the top and the boys at the bottom) or by replacing the number of boys or girls at the very beginning.\n\nWe can create another 3 solutions with the same arguments and this is the complete solution.

The question does not specify that the lions and rhinos are all different from each other, and that the zoo knows each escaped animal personally.\n4). So based on that, we would consider it possible that the zoo had 8 animals: 3 lions and five rhinos, although the question does not specify that.\n5). If the zoo had all of those animals and the zoo spends 2 hours to recover one animal, then the zoo takes 2 hours to cover the 8 animals.\n6).

Since the first number in the triplet is even, 8, and 8 is a multiple of 2, we can start at triplet n = 8*2, which is 16.\n3.

{"text": "To answer this question, I will do a comparison of months with a fraction method which will help to solve this problem. (i.e. 48/2)\n1. The question states that Natalia sold 48 clips in April then she sold half as much. To start off the example I use an example of 30, so it can be compared fairly.\n2. I would divide 48 by 2 to understand if that is 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, etc. or it is simply a fraction. \n3. For 48 you get 24 which is a fraction of two but would be 1/2. (You can tell this because it has the smaller number first) \n4. To find the fraction, divide 48 by two. The answer would be 24. But you could have divided it by 1/6,1/12,1/24, etc. because the same 48 is the denominator.\n5. The next question is to do the same but in monthly time. For example, you could do 30 for each month, but that is not the whole story here. \n6. In the example we are using 48, and then for April we half it in May but we had to do more than half way in April. \n7. One way to do this is to imagine, that instead of using the number 30 for Month, you use 30 fractions of the whole number, because every month you are subtracting it, so it's not quite 1/2. \n8. You want to multiply every month by 48, but subtract one, so in April you are using 30/48+47/48, then 29/48, etc. then you multiply by 30, this leaves you with 24/48,12/48, 4/48,6/48, so on. \n9. Then you can add up all the fractions, like: 20/48+1/48+3/48+6/48+8/48+12/48+5/48+2/48+4/48+10/48+20/4", "answer": " 72"}

The word \"tree\" is not defined in the question, so we can only assume it refers to fruit trees.\n3. To solve for the number of coconuts on his farm, we eliminate b by solving for x: 5x = 60 \u2013 x, thus x = 5, which leads to the coconut tree answer of 5 + 60 = 65. \n4. Now we can substitute 65 for x to solve for y: 5(65) = 60 \u2013 {65} = 95, thus the coconut tree number is 5 + 65 = 70. \n5. Thus, the total number of trees Randy needs in all would be: 60 + 70 = 130\nSo the final answer in all is 130\nInput: You have two boxes with the same number of marbles in them.

The remaining shrinks by -4 since there is 5, but 8 are people for a total of 8 - 5 = -3", "answer": " 75"}

{"text": "Jack has 12 inches worth of books, with a 1 inch density per book. For 6 books there would be 6/12 = 1 pages per book.\nThe correct answer is 1 page per book.\n\n\nInput:Is it true if n is even that n/2 even is true?  Output:  The question asks if, if n is even, is n/2 true for even? Thus, we have to prove that the statement is always true (always equivalent to true).\n\n### Example 1: If n=1 (n is even) then n/2=-1 (n/2 is even).\nThus, both are true. By proof by contradiction, we can prove that whenever n=even, n/2 is also even, thus the statement (n is even => n/2 is even) is true.\n\n### Example2: If n=3 (n is even) n/2 = 1.5 (n/2 is true). But 0.5 (1/2) is a real number.\nThus, we can also prove that n is even, and n/2 is always true.\n### In general, the only time that n/2 is not even, is when it's a positive number (even) and divides by 2 (even). When that happens, it's a real number, and will always be true.\n### Hence, therefore, in the given question, the question is asking whether 6 is even, if n/2 is true.\n### Since n/2 is not always true, and we have shown that it's (for sure) true for even numbers, then the statement is not always true, as it's not true when divided by 2, which is an even number, so the statement is false.\n\nInput:What is the remainder of 23 divided by 12? Output: The question asks for the remainder after dividing 23 by 12.

Also, the question only asks for the second remainder", "answer": " 160"}

{"text": "We start by eliminating all options that do not describe all employees: 1.  This question is asking about all employees of the company, so we start by eliminating any answer options that describe more or less than all employees (i.e. 1, all options other than \"60%\")\n2. Similarly, as this is a question involving % (expressed as a proportion), all options including \"half\" or \"less than half\" would be eliminated, as this is not a description of the amount of employees.\n3. If we exclude these options, we are left with all options that are expressions and can be compared: 4.  The options \"40 %\" and \"60%\" could both be true for the total amount of employees, which does not help in determining the answer to this question. \n5.  The answer we seek is the number of employees who drive to work compared to the number who choose public transportation, so we are looking to determine the answer for those who \" don't drive\".\n6.  From the previous 2 points we could see elimination option \"A\", \"B\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", and \"I\" for being unhelpful to the question.\n7.

For employees who do not drive, the options are \"half\" ( options O, U, V and W) and \"less than half\" ( options J, N and P).\n9. Since we do not know the number of people who drive and number who do not drive, we can determine the number between these by looking at how many of those drives/does not drives are in each section.\n10. Thus, 30% (option K) of the driving employees are more than 50% (half of \"does not drive\" option)  50% ( option half for \"does not drive\" ) are more than 30% ( drive option C),  which leaves 30% more drive and less than halves driving option.  \n(this could mean the less than 30% are more than 20 or more, or they could be more than zero as well as less than 60% of the does not drive options, which in this case is the most possible case", "answer": " 40"}

We will use the number \ud835\udc5d for money, and \ud835\udc5e for items (doodads). \nTherefore, for the first equation: \ud835\udc5d * 1000 = \ud835\udc5e\n\nNext, we will use substitution to find \ud835\udc5e. We will substitute in our base equation, so \ud835\udc5d can equal \ud835\udc5e + 1. Then our resulting equation becomes: \ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc5d - 1\n\nNext, we must find our end value in \ud835\udc5d, the amount of money. We want to find this by isolating \ud835\udc5d. To do this, we need to combine the two equations. To do this, let's subtract 10\ud835\udc5e from \ud835\udc5e on both sides: \ud835\udc7d \u2013 10\ud835\udc3e = \ud835\udc5a\nWe isolate the variable by subtracting 10 \ud835\udc88 from both sides: \ud83d\udca4 \u2013 **10\ud835\udc3b** = \ud835\udc66\nWe separate the variables by dividing both sides of the equation by 10 so they won't cancel: \ud835\udc61 = 10\ud835\udc88 + \ud835\udc53\n\nAfter finding our result, we divide our answers by 10. Therefore, \ud835\udc61 / 10 = 11\ud835\udc3e /10\nFinally, for our final answer, 11\ud835\udc88 = 11\ud82c\udfff\ud835\udc3e / 10.\nSo our final answer is $5.50 per doodads! \n\nInput: If", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "To solve the problem, we need to find the total time required for each type of clothes, and then the total time for all the tasks.\n\n1. First, total the time for all three types of clothes, and find their total time.\n\n2. The towels took twice as long as the other clothes. So their total time was 2x the other clothes' time, thus: 1x towels + 2x clothes total time.\n\n3. The sheets took 15 minutes less than the towels, so their time was 30 minutes - 15 minutes = 15 minutes. So their total time: 1x sheets + 1x clothes - 15 minutes.\n\n4. The last part to account for is Naomi's total time:\n\n5. Naomi spent 30 minutes on each type of washing task. However, in washing the towels it took her 2 times this amount of time.  So towels took up 30 minutes with Naomi + 2 times 30 minutes with her = 90 minutes. However, the towels took 2/1 times the time as the clothes + 30 + 15 = 55 minutes.\n6. Likewise, the sheets took 15 less minutes than the towels (30-15=15) + Naomi's time was 45 minutes.\n7. Next, consider the clothes. If it took Naomi 30 minutes on average to wash them, then her total time on clothes = 30 minutes.\n\n8. Finally, total the entire problem to arrive at her total time:\n\n9. After all of the calculations are done, it can be seen that Naomi had 55+45+30 minutes of total time spent on washing (T)  = 130 minutes, as shown below:\n\n10. Since the clothes take 30 seconds less than the towles, T= 60 (towels) + 80 (cloth) + 15 (sheets).\n\n11.

{"text": "1) For the first question, the input states that Holly must take 2 pills per day per insulin pill.\n2) For the second question, the input states the number of pills she can take per day is limited to the three main pills, 2 pills per insulin pill, Blood pressure pills, and anticonvulsants.\n3) Thus, this means she needs to make sure that all her pills do not exceed the 2 pills per tablet, and to add the number, we can divide 2 by her number of insulin tablets, and we should arrive at 2. However, if we divide 2 by 3, we arrive at only 60 pills. Thus, when we add, we actually subtract numbers that are the same in a situation such as this.\n4) Based off our formula, we can see that for every pill that she takes, she subtracts 1 from her number of anticonvulsants she takes that day.

{"text": "The process to solving this kind of question is essentially the same as the previous one.\n1. In this problem we are given the data (Joy can read 20 pages in 8 minutes), and asked to find an answer (Joys reads 80 pages in X hours), we will start by converting from one units to another.\n2. 20 pages * 8 minutes = 160 minutes (1.6 hours)\n3. Now we can translate this into a time unit that is closer to what we were given, by dividing 160 minutes by 120 pages, which becomes 1 page every 1.3333 minutes.\n4. So after 80 minutes (1.333 pages per 1.33 minutes) we should have read 80 pages, meaning that it will take her 80 minutes to read 12 pages.\n5. Thus Joy will take X hours to read 128 pages, but to simplify this lets replace the X with 12.\n\nSo the final answer for the question  \"How many hours will it take for Joy to read 12 book pages?\" is the answer 80 minutes (or 1.3 hours)\n\nInput: Which of these is larger, a deciameter or a meter?

This is the reason why the exam instructor chose this problem, it is a trap to see if you can make it from A - D -> E, or if you use \"A and B\" instead of \"A or B\" and go to C and D.\nIII. We are going to start with the first one that looks a little different \"a deciameter\", it is not really that difficult to spot, but when there are too many options it is hard to spot them.\nIV.

{"text": "The question is asking how many pieces of the four slices that are left uneaten.\nThis question requires a percentage based solution, thus using 4 steps in the solution.\n1. First, we use the formula for percentages to obtain the fractions to be used in the percent solution.\n2. Thus, the first step is to convert Bill and Dale's slices to fractions. The formula for percentages is the denominator over 100 (pct = 100%). Thus, Bill and Dale' have 15 pieces of their slices left over. \n3. Then, this leaves the Ann and Cate slice to be 87.5%. Therefore, the solution is the following; \nAnn: 47.5% Dale: 45.625% Bill: 15% Cate: 32.5% 4.

I was thinking of all the ways to help them out. How could I find out how much food to make them 196 calories each?\nOutput: Well, 196 is not a nice, even-looking number.\nWhat I can do, is find a calorie-packed amount of food, like 500 cals, then divide that by the answer I got from the math I previously used. For example: if this food I have is 500 calories per thing, then I would get 0.38 things per 196 calorie cat.\nI would have to do this 6 times (since there are 6 cats in need of food), to be accurate to the 196 cal need for each cat.\nSo I get to 0.38 x 6 = 2.324 cals per cat.\nWell, there are 196 cals per cat...\n196- 2.32= 416 cal left to help the cats.\nSo I will have to make about 418 cals of cat food, but since I need to have only 2% water, I would make 418 + (418*0.02) = 417 + 8.36 = 425.36\nSo the final answer: 425. 36 cals\n\nInput: There were 27 cats in that pet shelter and they were hungry because their owners were allergic to cats.

This tells us that we need to take the initial balance of $4o and subtract the total amount she spent to get the original balance. In this case, the amount spent is $40 + half of $40 or $20 + twice $40 or $80. This gives us that initial balance of $4.\n\n9.

{"text": "Given the information provided in the question, the total earnings for Uki in five days is $950.\n1. The first stage of the solving process is to read the question, break it down into simpler questions, and identify the variables that you need to work with. 2. For this question, the variables are as follows: 3. Uki - Uki is the owner of the bakery; cupcakes - the amount of units (U) of cupcakes that can be produced in a day; cookies - the amount of U of cookies that can be produced ina day; biscuits - the amount of U biscuits that can be produced in day; total earnings ($); a day; five (5) days;\n4. To answer this question, you need to multiply the value of U of each item per day by the number of daily outputs, then multiply by the number of days.\n5. For the cupcakes (option 1), U = 20; a day means multiply by 5, then the total earnings are $100 dollars; since we need to convert our total earnings to the base unit, dollars, we divide by 5, getting $20; thus for the value of cupcakes per day U = 20 7 days/5 = $40 - (dividing by five)\n6. For the cookies (option 2), U = 10; a day means that it is multiplied by 5; then the total number of days (7 days) is multiplied by five, giving us $350 (using division to transform the $35 from dollars to our base unit).   So the total earnings from the cookies are $350 divided by five is $70.\n7. For the biscuits (option 3), U also = 20; but a day means it is multiplied by three; again, total earnings from 5 days is $1,100 (7 days/3 = $234; then, using division to transform, getting $234 divided by three).\n8. Therefore, the final answer is U for cupcakes = 20 40 dollars/5 = $4 dollars = $20 7 days x 4 dollars \u2248\u00a0$88;  \nU for cookies = 10", "answer": " 350"}

When you get some mangoes, each time they weigh about 50 grams less.  If you get 100 grams of them in a bag, how much do you weigh in total?\nOutput: First the question is asking what happens when you take out some mangoes, then we calculate what happens when you take 100 gr the mangoes.\n\n1.) When you take out the mangoes the weight of the mangoes is reduced by 50g for each mango you take out.  Thus, the weight decreases by 50g each time and the total weight reduces by 50g (50).\n\n2.) If we take 100g (0.1 kg, or 1000g in total) of mangoes out, which weighs (1000 x 0.5) or 500g total, we would have a decrease total weight by 505g. We should use the value from 1), so 50g, to get the total.\n3.) Therefore the total weight of the remaining mangoes is 500g-50g. 500g is 0.5kg, so there are 1kg or 100kg total mangoes remaining.\n4.) We can get the total weight of the mango by simply adding 100kg to (60 x 0.1 kg).\n\nInput: A rooster weighs over 5kg\nWhat does a hen weigh?\nOutput: \n1.) The question is", "answer": " 30"}

If we were told she consumed 8 cups by the end of a single day, we would say her consumption has been over the minimum amount. \nThis means Sarah needs to reduce her intake from that day to a lower amount, so she meets the minimum amount again, the next day.\n3. We know that she needs to meet the minimum amount per day.\n4. We know that she currently has 8 cups consumed.\n5. We know that if she continues her daily consumption at the level she has had until that day she has already used her minimum amount.\n6. The question asks for the amount she needs to minimize her daily consumption too, for her to meet the minimum consumption level required.\n7. To do this, we use the following equation: Amount consumed for week - Amount consumed for Sunday = daily required amount.\n8. As we have only 3 additional days which means we can only use the 5 remaining cups left, after all 8 cups were consumed.\n9. Thus 7 - 8 = 1:1, so we need to reduce our intake by 1 cup during week, to have the minimum amount required per day.\n10. As this is the amount she needs to eat, we multiply it by 7, ie: 20 which is equal to 5+10, so that is the minimum amount she needs to eat to meet the minimum requirements for the week.\n11.

This seems like a simple math question asked to a property manager to get an accurate rent price for a building. Given our understanding of the word multi-story, it means the building will go past one, possibly multiple floors. In addition, the office buildings generally require multiple people and therefore multiple room/office space. This means there will be many rooms.

The same process goes for the haircut (15 +15 = 30) and the doctor's appointment (5 +5 =10).\n5. So when you sum the miles up you get 30 + 30 + 10, you will have driven a total of 70 miles.\n6. This means that we need to divide 70 in (halfway + 1) which is 70/2 and the answer becomes 35+1 = 36.\n7. So the final answer is 36.

We must eliminate this case so we must get rid of the multiples that are in between 3 and the number that we picked as a multiple, so 6 is not a multiple of 3, because it lies between 3 and 5, which is not allowed. Thus that means that all we have to do is take 5 and find the multiples of 5, and the 1 and 5.\nSo if we go from 3 down to 1, the first number we find is 3 and then there is an option if we choose to choose the multiples of 3 or not.

The answer is A, the white birds are 16 and the black are 103.\nSo the final answers are A, the answer is 16\n\nInput: How many times larger is the circumference c of a circle compared to the diameter d of a circle with the same area?\nOutput: 3.142 1. The question asks how large it is? The units need to be found out. 2. It needs to be calculated 1000 times to get a reasonable answer. 3. Since \u03c0 = 3.14159 9999 etc.\nAnd we can write \u03c0 as 22/7 1000 to get an answer of\n1.4142 166 which is a very big answer and 9999 decimal number we have it. 4. Multiplying the number of circumference (the larger) by the number of area (the smaller) gives us the answer. 5. The circumference is 2\u03c0r, to get the radius, divided by the area, of a circle the answer is \u03c0r\u00b2 So the answer is 3.14\n6.

{"text": "Jeff did 12 rounds, instead of 4 rounds.\n\n### Explanation: The rule is that the total number of skips done in 4 rounds by both competitors, Sam and Jeff, and then the total is divided by the number of rounds they did (4 in total). Since there were 8 sets of Sam and Jeff's data, multiply those numbers by 4 (the number of rounds to get the total number of skipping times). Sam has 16 numbers which Jeff completes his 8 + 4 = 12 total rounds, so then subtract the 16 and 12, which is 4. This leaves a remainder of 4. Because there are 4 sets, take the average of the 4 numbers to get 7. 4 + 4 = 8 and 8 / 4 = 2 rounds. \n\n### Input : There are 2 dogs.

If the brown dog\u2019s back is 2m long, how many m of brown dog\u2019s legs go with the brown dog?\n\n### Rule: You need to add how blue dog's legs are shorter to the total brown dog's legs and also the legs that are shorter than the brown dog's.\n\n### Response : 15 m is needed to go with that brown dog.\n\n### Rationale : The rule is that the number of legs that are brown and the legs that are blue.

{"text": "The answer is 70. Since every sixt customer gets a free ice-cream cone, the 60th customer will receive his free cone while the 61st customer will pay $2. Since the cost of a cone is $2, Dan will spend $120(from the first 60 customers). So, the 61st and 62nd customers will each pay $0.\nThe 63rd customer will pay $2 as well since he's the 61st. The next customer, being the 62nd, will pay $2 as an addition to what he paid in his first round, thus bringing the total paid to $144\nSo the total customers are 60, making the remaining 60 customers get a free ice-creams. Out of the 60 free ones, 59 will be given to customers 11 - 69. Hence the 60th free cone would be given to the 60th person.\nSince the 61 customer paid no amount of money, he will be given a free ice-creame, making the remaining 58 free ones and the 70th customer free as well.\nThe 61st customer paid $2, so he would get a free cone as well, thus giving a grand total of $70.\n\n### Input\nThe question asks: \"There are 5 blue, 6 red, and 4 green cars in this parking lot. How many more red cars are there than green cars?\"\n\n### Rationales:\nThe answer is that there are more red cars than green cars. There's 5 blue cars, hence 5 cars out of the 3 red cars are blue, which only leaves 2\nThere's 4 green cars, hence 4 out of the 3 green cars are green, which leaves only one.\nThere's 6 red cars, hence 4 red cars out of the 6 red cars are red, leaving 2.\nSo there's 2 red cars left, making it more, thus 5*4= 20 red cars overall.

Tim's cat's visit cost of $120 and Tim's pet insurance covered 60% of the total cost, which equals $72. So, Tim'S Visit totaled cost around $297.2.\n\n### Assistance:\nInput:Tim's cat is a wild one! He decided to get himself checked out.  His doctors visit $300 and his insurance covered 70%.  How much did he need to pay?\n\nAnswer:\nDoctor visit cost = 70% of 300\n\nTherefore, Tim's Doctor Visit Cost = 300 X.7\n\nCost of Doctors Visit = 3 x 100\n\nCost of Doctory Visit = 300\nCost of Doctor's Visit = (3x100) + 300\nTherefore, Cost of Doctors Visit is $400.\n\nInput:How much does Tim owe for his Doctor's visit after insurance?\n\nRationales:Insurance covered 75%.Therefore, The insurance covered = (75 of 100 = 15/100).Therefore, The uncovered is 75 - (15/10). Therefor the uncovered is 60.\n\nTherefore, $300 - 60 = $240\n\nAnswer:\nThe uncovered is 40. \n\nThe bill of 300 paid by Tim is 60.

{"text": "The first thing to note is that the first path to the destination takes 51 hours, so we need to do the second path (which is now 60 miles) in time left over.\nSince we can go an average of 2 miles per minute, the time left is going slower each mile, so we must drive much faster for the 10 miles.\nAs speed of traveling faster increases, speed of traveling slower also gets exponentially slower.\nThis concept is based on the idea that speed is a constant, so if we double speed we would be moving at a constant speed over 10 miles and so on.\nTo figure out total travel time for entire trip, we add the time given for going to tour destination (59 hours (51+8)).  \n\nAnswer: The first thing to note is the tour destination distance (51 miles). As per the textbook, let's call it 'A'.\nThe second thing to note is there is a second path that is longer, meaning there is more distance for tour to cover. However, we can cover this new path in the time left over after we return to the starting point (1 hour more than the destination (59 hours remaining) which we will call 'B'.\nHence, we need to travel 60 miles which is A + B.\nDividing the distance to be traveled by time (which is constant), we have 1 mile = 0.0166 hours.\nAs speed of time is 1, we can double it, and so we multiply by 2.\n\nAs we have already covered 51 miles, let's call what is left 33 miles = (A + 1 hour).\nThis means that while going 60 miles, Manex needs to cover 60 miles in 10/33th the time. Since 1 is the constant for 1 minute and time is going faster the further he goes, we need to double it for the next 2/3 minute to reach the right answer.\nFor the next 1/3 miles we need to double the speed to make it in 1/6 the time, and so on.\n\nUsing the equation 1 mile = 1/33th hour and multiplying by 2, we get 2 miles = 1/(16+26) = 1/3", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "James had a 20% savings from selling his previous car.  He got the same discount buying the new car as buying the previous car.  \nHence, he would have gotten a $20,050 car for $27,000.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question tells us that James sold his $20K car for 80%.  That means James got $16K back from the selling of his car.\nHopefully, James can get 90% back from the haggle of his new car deal.  So, the discount of the new car can be calculated as follows: 90% - 80% = 10% discount from the new car.\n\n\nWe also notice that the savings of the previous car is subtracted from the same discount applied to the new car.  Thus,\n\nSavings of the previous car + Discount savings of the new car = 20000\n\nHence, the new car price would be: 2000 + 1000 + 27000 +16000 = 27005\n\n### Input- James has a $3500 loan with a 5% interest rate.

For instance, if the person used the gift certificate to buy an item that was a cheaper than the certificate value, then, we can use the certificate value to pay off the difference. However, if the item is more expensive than the gift certificate value, then we use the amount of the difference. In this case, the difference is 50 dollars: the person used a 57 dollars gift certificate to buy a $7 item. Hence, total transaction value is $47.", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "The question is asking for the number of eggs gathered by the remaining 6 egg hunters after taking into consideration that all of the egg gathers started with an equal number of eggs. \n\n###  -  \n\nRationales:\n[1]. This paragraph starts by telling us that Emma and Tank were the only ones who participated in both rounds of egg hunting. \n[2]. Note that the question says the total number of eggs they had gathered in the first game, which refers to the number gathered by each participant individually.\n[3]. The paragraph states that in the first round of egg hunting, Tank gathered 6 more eggs than Emma, and the second round, Emma gathered 12 times more eggs than Tank. The statement tells us the number of eggs Emma gathered in the second round is a factor of the number Tank gathered in the first round, which is why the statement is true.\n[4]. The question asks that we take into consideration the fact that all participants started out with an equal number of Easter eggs, and that Tank collected more eggs individually than Emma. Considering these facts, we know two people collected 60 eggs while Emma collected 60 eggs, leaving five participants who all collected 30 eggs each.\n[5]. Since in the first round, Tank and Emma collected an equal number of eggs, the number of eggs Emma collected in the second round is equal to the sum of the number of eggs Tank collected in the two rounds. \n[6]. This statement can be tested by substitution. \n[7]. This statement can be rewritten using the fact that 36 is a multiple of 6, as stated in the question.\n[8]. This statement can be simplified by factoring out the multiplier 60 from both sides of the equation, which results in 6\u00d730=180=3\u00d736.\n[9].

The cat is half as fast as a deer.  Deer is twice as fast as an elephant.  If the cat is running at 15 miles per hour, determine the minimum speed of the elephant.\nRationales:The statement, \"The dog is twice as fast a cat.\" implies that dog is as fast as \"cat x 2\" \nThe statement, the cat is \"half as fast as the deer\" means that there is a factor of \"1/2\" between the cat and the deer.\n\nTherefore, based on the information, we can conclude that the cat moves at 25 miles per hour.\n\nNext, the statement.  \"Deer is twice as fast an elephant.\" implies that the deer moves at \"elephant x 2\"  or 20 miles per hour.\nThe same relationship is being repeated (the elephant x 2), so, we can conclude that they are 40 miles per hour. Based on the information above, the cat moves at 60 miles per hour and the deer at 40 miles per per hour.\nFinally, the statement \"If the cat is 20 miles per hous, determine the minimum speed\" implies that the cat moves at less than 20 per hour\n\nTo find the number that is less than 20, we have to take the negative \nOf -20 which gives us -$20; which means that we divide the 60 into this negative 20 to find out how many units of time the cat takes to reach the required speed. In addition, the dog moves at 20 miles per 20 minutes.

{"text": "Larry and Barry have to first decide which one of them is going to climb in the other one's shoulders.  Once that is agreed upon, it becomes easier to figure out which of the two can reach the high apples because whoever is climbing on the shoulders is supposed to measure from their shoulder height and not from their head or the ground.  If Larry is the one to climb on Barry's shoulder, then the answer is that they can reach apples that is 20% higher than five feet from the ground, or 25 feet high.  This is because their combined height is 25 feet, and 20% of 25 is 5 feet.  However, Larry could still do it without even needing Barry's shoulders.

It is easier to think about the width of the boats since the width of the river is constant. The first boat fits easily and all the boats can be lined up in two files.\nNext is a boat that is 2 feet wide. This is more than the width of the river so we have to find a boat that fits. The first boat fits so the 2 foot wide boat fits. We go back to our original position of the first boat and the 2-foot wide boat fits perfectly. The 3-foot wide boat is still the first boat in the file, so it fits. The second boat still fits so the third boat cannot fit, but the fourth boat can. The third and fourth boat fit so this arrangement holds true.\nFor the fifth boat, it cannot fit, so it overlaps the next boat in line, which is the sixth boat. Now, the sixth boat cannot fit because the first and second boats overlap. The fifth boat overlaps so it cannot fit, so now the fifth boat is in front of the next boat, which is the seventh boat.\nThe seventh boat is the last in line which leaves one of the spaces for the fifth and sixth boats. Now we are down to 1-foot spaces between the boats, and each needs 2-feet.\n\nIf the width of the 3-foot boat is the same as the width of the other boats, it does not fit. But the 3-foot boats are 2 feet long, so we have to make sure that there is 2 feet of space. We check the first row for 1-foot spaces and find none. We must move one of the boats into the 1-foot space and see if we can fit. We cannot fit because the two boats overlap.\n\nAnswer:\n\na) 9\nb) 23\nc) 18\nd) 12\n\n### Note:\nThe boat race, which is in a river, means that the boats, which are 3 feet wide, must be at least 3 feet from one another.

The place we get the food from is the supermarket. Then, any other place would be a location we do not have to indicate. We cannot identify the compost bin as a location we need to identify because we will never find food in the compost bin.

The judge wants Mark to get a first-hand experience of what it is like to speed, so he doubles the fine for going 75 miles over the speed limit.\n2. As an additional penalty, he increases the fine by $100 which is equivalent to two miles per hour of speeding.\n3. In addition, the school zone fine of $70 is applicable.\n4. Therefore, the final amount Mark owes is $300 + $530 + $220 + $140 = $1190 +100 = $1290. Finally, he will have to pay $80 for three hours of work amounting to $240 to his lawyer. Therefore, the final bill comes to $1290+$240=$1530.\n\n\n### Response (with an explanation):\nThe base fine for speeding in this case is $50, but Mark is speeding 75 miles over in a 30 miles per hour zone and he was in a school, so there are extra penalties that make his fine more.  The fine is initially $100 but it is doubled to $200.

To do this, we need to find out how much money they earn per ride:\n3. Let us assume that each person went once on the Ferris wheel and twice on the bumper car and one time on the space shuttle.\n4.

{"text": "1 box\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following math question.\n\nInput: In the figure below, what is the value of X?\n\n\nRationales:\n1. The perimeter of the square has a value of 50 inches.  X represents the width of the triangle. \n2. The base equals a length of 28 inches, and there are triangles of that base on both sides so the width of the triangle is less than 28.\n3. The triangles have a width of 0 so the total width is less than 27.5 inches.\n4. The length of the base is equal to a value of 55 inches which is less than 2/3 of the perimeter value.\n5. A sum of 28 + 27.5 + 55 is a value of 100 which is less than 1.5 times the perimeter value and not equal to 2/3 of perimeter value. So the value of X must be an amount less than 2/2 of 2 inches.\n6. The sum of 6 + 2 is 8 and 8 is less than 2 times 1/1 of 4 inches.  Hence the value of X should be less than 2/1 of 4 = 2 inches or 20/100ths of a foot.\n7. Therefore, the value in inches would be 0.2 inches or 2/100th a foot.\n\n\n## Output: 2/10 in\n\n### Rationale #1:\n1. The width and height of the square has a length of 20 units. \n2.

If we were to ask if a person is an expert in a set of things or knowledge, by their lack of correct affirmation we conclude that they are not an expert.\n2. Hence if Dane answers 'no' to being an expert in 5 languages, then the answer should be 'no'.\n3. Note: \nThe reason why we had to start a new line after the previous is to show that the dummy input is an incorrect way of expressing the problem.

In Mr. Brandon' s shop, the amount is 50% of the total amount. So,\n\nLet x be 50% of total sales amount.\n\nThen: X+total sales amount - credit sales amount = total sales\n\nFrom here, rewritten again, your question is:\n\nHence: Cash sales= total sales- credit sales amount/2\n\nI found your question was very hard to understand and difficult to answer.

Herman needs to buy three times as much food as he needs per month because each cup is counted twice. For each month, he has a total of 4\u00bd cups of food.\n\n### Explain:\n1. To solve this question correctly, I had to understand it. There is a relationship between days and months. Each day is a fifth of a month, and each month is a complete one-sixth of the year.\n2. After understanding it, I was able to come up with the solution. The relationship between months, days and years is an addition so I have to add the three quantities.\n3. I added the quantities to be solved in the form of addition and, in the end, I got my answer-3.5.

The rationales are:\n\n1. The instruction text gives us an idea that the sand dollars are money.\n2. We are given two operations of sand dollars-giving away and selling half of the remaining sand dollar. So, Mike was left with only 38 sand dollars by the end of this operation.\n\n3.

{"text": "1. The question is about Jill and her brother Jack who are going apple picking together, and are carrying two baskets.  Jill' capacity for apples is twice that of Jack, and therefore, Jill's basket is half-full at zero apples, which is then doubled when Jack and Jill both fill up their baskets.\n2.  But the actual number of apples is irrelevant to the question because we're asked to calculate the number of times that Jack's full basket could fit into Jill' basket.\n3. If the full basket that needs to go into the other basket contains 12 apples (which, for the sake of simplicity, we'll call its capacity 12), then the current number of apples in Jill' basket is 8 (one for each apple, plus 8). \n4. One way of determining the number of times Jack' basket could actually fit into the empty Jill' basket is to think of it as having a slot of capacity 12, containing one apple.\n5. It now becomes a matter of whether this smaller basket can fit in the 12-apple-bigger bucket. \n6.  Suppose the smaller (Jack's) basket contains more than 12 apples.  The question doesn't ask for this, but if instead it contained 13, how many would fit? 1, of course, because the basket is full.  But if it contains 14, how many will fit? 2, because the number of apples (1) is less than half of the basket's capacity for apples (14).\n7.

{"text": "Mark needs 72 hours to jump all 54000 times, because 72 times by 3 equals 216.  Each second, he could jump 3 times.  \n\n### Rationale\n1. The question is whether Mark can jump all 72 times in 72 hours(one day) to do it all. \n2. In 1 hour(the time it took him to jump all the times in 72 minutes), he could jump only 60 times and it is not yet the whole number as he required and wanted.\n3. However, in 72 hours, a minute is approximately 4.32, and a day is 24 * 3600 seconds.  A day is 24 hours, which is about 86400 seconds.\n4. Therefore, Mark would need to jump for 72/3600 times to make it in one day.  He can not do that, since he could only jump 54 times a day.\n5. That means Mark needs 72/54 times to do all the jumps, which is 136. 136(136 times) * 3 = 418 because he can jump exactly twice.\n6. Therefore, Mark will need 418 hours(15 days) to jump and set the records.\n\n### Input:\\nThis is a multi-choice questions. Choose the BEST answer.\n\n### Rationales\n1. Mark could not have set the record with 1 hour, because he does not complete all the rope jumps in 1 hour, which was the time he needed.\n2. However, he could finish them all, if he had 15 times the number of hours he needed.\n3. That is 15 times 24 equals 360  and that is a whole number 360.\n\n### The correct answer is B: 15 days, because it is the best choice.\n\nThe best choice is C not D. D does not make sense at all.

{"text": "1. Answer:300 hours.   \n\n### Supporting rationale:\n1. To make a reasonable calculation, it is necessary to know the number of days Mark has left after using the first 50 percents of his allotment.\n2. This can be calculated as follows: 10 * 10 - 50 = 50, which we can further simplify to 50 days.\n\n3. We now have to determine how long a day of vacation and sickness is with respect to an 8 hour day of work. For instance, if it takes 4 hours to recover from a sickness day and 4 hours to travel and spend 4 hours at the park on a vacation day, then 10 vacation day hours will take up 10 /4 = 2.5 weeks.\n4. We can use this information to calculate the number of hours Mark has left. We can start this calculation by dividing 10 by 2.5 to get 4 days, which we can then multiply by 8 to get 32 hours, which is equivalent to 300 total hours.\n\n##\n\n### Instructions:In this assignment, you will need a calculator to complete the below word problems. \n### Instruction(s): \n\t### Question(s):\n\t\t1.

If she divides the area of the fabric(56 squre meters) by the area of each dress(4 sqaure meters) we get 56/4=14.\nThe time to make each dress is 4hours as we stated earlier.\nNow, we need to know if she can finish in the time left as well. 3 hours was alloted for 14 dresses. If we divide the remaining hours left(7.33) by the number of dresses she can finish(14) then we get 0.5225 which we round off to 0.52 = 7.33/14.\n7.33 is not equal to 7.33, but if we take what we rounded and subtract it from 8 hours which was alloted, we get 0.12 = 14m-7hours so that means Melissa has left about 12 minutes to work. 12m-12=11m\nTherefore, Melissa is left with 13 hours and 11 mins to finish.\n\n### Discussion:\nWe should not have to round off to 0 because 7.33 is close enough for it to be 7:33.

I start with the first option 'Park'because it's the last option.\n3. Since the question 'where do humans go to experience nature' does not involve any location outside cities then the only viable option in that category is the park.\n4. As for the other option 'country,' I don't want to consider it because it would give a completely different answer to the question at hand.\n5. I can, therefore, rule out 'country' as an answer. I have all the three options left and considering the fact that I want to answer 'How many candies remain?'from the question, I must consider the 40 red candys and 20 yellow candys.\n6. From 40 red, I can comfortably eliminate 24 red candys and I am left with only 16 red candys out of 40 candies.\n7.

Dickens, in all, wrote numerous stories of humanity's struggle with a selfish and oppressive society. In this excerpt, he depicts the story of a lonely, yet powerful man, as he strives to make up for his faults. The characters act as metaphors for the poor and the upper class. Dickens' writing shows how cruel people can be to each other if they do not use mercy.\n\n\n\n \n#### Question 6\n\n### Instructions\nWrite a response that appropriately answers this question or poses a new, related, question.\n\n## Instructions:\n### Demonstion \nA 1: What is the difference in price between the lowest-cost plan that matches the student's needs and the highest-cost plan that matches student's needs?\n\n### Solution  \nSince the total price of the lowest-cost plan 1 + 0.5(500 + 100) = 50.5\nAnd the total price of the highest-cost plan 2 + 0.5 (600 + 150) = 110.5\nThe difference is 110.05 \u2013 50.5 = 59.55 \nThis difference would  be called \"the gap\".\n\n### Question \nWhat is the lowest-cost plan for this student?", "answer": " 2"}

Hence, its cost is half of the total cost.\n   ==> The sandwich costs $4.\n2. The bottle of juice is 2x the bottle of milk, since the milk bottle is one-fourth the sandwich.\n   ==> The cost of the bottle of juice in the question is $8.\n3. The cost of the bottled milk is 75% of that of the bottled juice\n   ==> Hence, the cost of the bottle milk is $6.\n4. The total cost of the bottled juices and sandwich is $17.72, indicating that the total cost of the juices and sandwiches is $17.82. This is greater than the $17.6 that we got before.\n   ==> Hence, we have our final cost and got the right answer of $17.6.\n\n### Output: The juice was twice as expensive\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: We started the day when we were in 3rd century Rome\nOutput:  Yes, we started the day.\n\n### Rationale: The statement indicates 3rd century Rome, which is a name for an era, as indicated by the first character of the input, \"we\". This era is represented in the given statement as \"in\", indicating that it was an active part of the entire sentence. Hence, the statement indicates the start of the day, because \"we lived in the 3rd century Rome.\" By stating that the sentence begins in the 3rd Century Rome, it is not a question. Therefore, the statement is affirmative and hence the outcome \"yes, we started the day.\"\n\n### Input:`I just got home from work`\n\nOutput: Yes, you just got home from work.\n\n### Demo: You would give the answer \"yes\" since I have a definite indication that you just got home from \nwork.

How many  times did it go to the number 3?\n\n### Rationale\nThere are a number of ways to arrive at this answer. For instance, one can apply the division rule of arithmetic. The number 62 was divided by the digit 3 to produce the remainder of 4. This means that 62 will go to the number 4 6 times.\n\n### Response\n The answer to the given question is 6.

It does not make sense to divide the number 62 by itself; hence we get a remainder of 4.\nInput answer: the answer is 6. The remainder is 4, so the remaining part is 6.\nInput answer: C. There is no remainder, so there is no division being done.\nInput answer: B. No, the number 4 is divisible by itself because the result is 1.\nInput answer: D. The division is not done. The division is 56 \u00f7 12 + remainder. If the remainder is zero, then there\u2019s no division.\nInput answer: E. No. 8000 does not divide evenly into 5.

We can rewrite the input statement as follows, with the different piles defined:\n\nNaomi is doing the _wash_. First, she makes piles of _different\ntypes_, with one pile for _towels_, one for _sheets_, and one for\n_clothes_ that need to be wash on the _gentle cycle_. The clothes\n_take 30 minutes to_ wash. The _towels take twice as long to_ wash\nas the _sheets_. The sheets _take 15 minutes less to_ wash than the\ntowels.\n\n2. Let's compute each pile's time first for clarity:\n\nSheets | Towels | Clothes  \n15 | 30 | 30\n\n3. We can then compute the total time:\n\nSince the clothe type needs to be washed on gentle cycle and\nNaomi is doing wash, the total time of the wash has to be less than or\nequal 30 minutes otherwise it will take longer than 30 minutes.\nTherefore, the total time should be  \n\n30 \u2264 min{15,30}\n\nwhich is  \n\n25 minutes, hence correct answer.\n\n### Source:\nJapanese:   [Koto Gakushuu](https://www.wj-uji.jp/gakuji/koto_gakushuu/)\nEnglish:   [Daily Words](https://study.prozara.com/eng/lessons?lesson_id=199835)\n\n\n### Previous: [[Reading Passage Practice 12.5 | Section 13.3]](read26-20200711.md) | [Table of Contents](read26-tableofcontents.md) | [Next: Section 15 | Section 15 Practice](read27-20201223.", "answer": " 135"}

The customer wants the tape that is 20% off. The price of the 5% off tapes must be $20, because if the customer wants a 20% off they must be $20 off of the original price. If a 5% off tpe is $20 then the original price would have to be $220. The tape must be % off, but the store has the 5% tape and the 20% tape. The 20% tapes cost $20 less than the 5% tapes, so the 5% taps are $20 off of their original price.

In another case, there are 25 more votes for the dragon. To answer the question, we first have to get the number of votes for each kind of cake. As explained in the question summary, there are seven votes for the black cakes, and we also know that the number of votes for cake is at least equal to the number of people who voted for the cake. So, 7*24=168 votes for dragon and at least 168 more votes for unicorn=336 votes for the unicorn. Then, 168*25=4325 votes for the dragon and at least equal to 4325+168 unicorn=4739 votes for the dragon, now we have determined the number of votes for unicorn, We can now determine the votes for the witch=336-4325=1682 votes for the witch.

Rod must have 105 in total, Ian 45 and Jessica, who has 3 times more, must have 100, 5 more than Ian. So they are all together -100/0=100.\n\n### Counter Response:\nTo counter my rationales, let's say that Rod was originally 50% richer than Ian, which is (0.5 + 0.5)/2. So, rod was originally rich by 100/2 = 50. So, in a new division 10/5 Rod will get 2 and 1/2/7 will get 6/5. So rod lost a 4th of his money and i lost 33/33.\n\n### Output:\n1. 35\n2. 1/2 = 0,5\n3. Jessica has 199 instead of 200 but because we know that they both has 100,19 less, jessica has 400 and 400-199=51.\n4. So, we can see that Rodney has 303 dollars at first and now he has 199, that's 0.67 of 303 and since ian was richer (by 100), he became 200-35-19 1,520, which is half of 302. That means 0.65 + 0.35,0.65", "answer": " 15"}

A person, 30 pounds heavier, is asked what they weigh. Give a program or formula to compute the correct answer to both questions.\n\n### Response :\nLet x be the weight of the lighter person, and let y be the weight of the heavier person. These are linear equations because they\u2019re a function of a single variable. The question asks for a formula to compute what the heavier person weighs, which translates to a formula for y(x). Let\u2019s say that there is a function f(x) that is equal to the difference in the two people\u2019s weight values (ie. x and x + 35). Since the person weighing 30 pounds more is heavier, f(x) has to be negative (ie it needs to be -30 pounds). If x represents the lighter person, then subtracting 35 from it will give the answer of what the heavier person is (ie -35). Therefore, f(x) = -30.\n\nA similar approach can be taken if we want to find the weight of the lither person (ie x). In this case, we\u2019ll use the function g(x). First, we calculate the x value for the heavier person. (ie, x + 35) -30 The -30 is the value of f(x). We\u2019ll take that as a constant multiplier and use it to offset the lighter person\u2019s weight. Therefore: x = -30/35", "answer": " 240"}

Harris has a carrot tree with the number of bags of carrots equal to it's age. The tree is 6 months old, so Harris has 6 bags of carrotes.\n3. Harris buys 18 bags of carroats.\n\n### Explanation:\nI chose the answer 18, because it's the simplest. Each day, Harris needs to buy a bag of carrots and his dog will eat two carrots, so he should buy five of them. When he first makes it with the dog, he'll buy five bags and they will last him a week, then on Sundays he'll spend another 5 dollars on carrots, for example if he has four bags and his dog goes through a whole one that day, he'll buy two more. Then on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, he'll have to buy another five bags.

Each is 12 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.  He also needs some smaller boxes, each 3 inches X 4 inches X 3 inches.  How many smaller boxes are needed.  Note that it should be the product of 3 and the quotient of 12 and 4.\n\n### Answer, Step 2:To solve this problem, we could divide 15 by 12 first and then by 4, or we could think about the boxes in terms of their dimensions -- in this case, the height of the big boxes.\n\nIf we had to build the boxes from scratch, we would use (12 X 4) cups to make 4 cubes.  Since we need 15 of them, we need (15 X 4) cuples.  We then need to add 6 cuples to that quantity to make an additional 2 cubes.  Those 2 cubes will be two-dimensional, but they're still cubes, so all our computations remain the same.\n\nBecause the big boxes are bigger than the little boxes, the fractional difference will be bigger.  With each extra small box, one-fourth of a cube is reduced to one-half a cube.\n\nThe 2 cubes (which aren't actual cubes) take away 4/3 cubes (which aren\u2019t actually cubes).\n\nAnswer: With reference to the problem of 4 X 12 divided by 4 :\n\nSince 1 box takes in 12 units and 4 inches, 4 units of boxes will take in 48 of units, however, it only takes 12 units", "answer": " 38"}

City A, located in Country A, had approximately 10,000 people in the year 2010.  City A's population is increasing at an overall increasing rate of 1% per year compounded annually. What will the population of City A be in the year 2,020?\n\n### Rationale:\n1. We are given that the rate of increase in Country A and City A is 2% compounded yearly and 1% compounded yearly respectively.\n2. We also have to factor in that Population A has approximately 10, 000 people in 2010 and has an increasing rate of 1%.\n3. From the two given conditions, we can infer that the Population A increase by 2010 will be 2010-10000=1000, so we can say it is 1,000 more than 10,0% in the year 220\n\n### Output:92,500", "answer": " 16"}

The question is giving us a scenario in which James can only sell movies he has already created at events.\n2. Since he can no longer create movies to sell he must use his existing stock of movies.\n3. Events last 1 day therefore he can only sell his moviegoes at events.\n4. It takes James 2 days to create one dvd.\n5. It takes James 4 days to make one movie.\n6. We need to multiply the number of days James can sell at events by the number of movies he can sell each day.\n7. So, we need to multiply 4, by 7 and this equals 28. He can sell 28 movies in 7 days.\n\n### Response : \nIf james create one movie each 4 days and 2.5 times the cost to make them, he could sell 250 movies in 5 days.

{"text": "From the problem statement: Tim rides his bike both ways to work and back for 5 days a week. The statement is unclear and does not really give the duration of his work day and does not give us any information about the route that he takes between his home and the workplace, for example, whether that is straight or on a detour. So we need to assume that he arrives at work in the morning and leaves at night. Also, he has a weekly break of one day.  Let's call this day, day A.  So 5 workdays, 1 weekend, and 1 weekday break, add up to 7 days in a week.    \nThe question doesn't indicate the direction for the bike ride i.e. is it on the return path or return path. We can assume that he is using the same amount of time for his commute from home to work and vice versa, since it mentions work and work. So, in the question, we have seven days and he bikes 20 mi to work. Hence, the number of trips per day or per week is 10. Let us divide the weekly (the sum of the number of bike trips per day over the number of days in the week). Since he is riding both ways to work, the number of bike rides is 50.   Let us calculate his average bike ride time.\nWork days, Day A:  5 trips per day *20 miles each way * 2 trips per day * 3.5 hours to commute daily * 7 days in a work week *1 day= 225miles *1day =225miles per 7days = 32.5miles per day\nWeekend, Day A:\n5 trips x 20 miles each way x 2 trips per week = 50 miles per week\nWeekend, Day B: Weekend = 1day * 5 trips per day x 20 miles for a bike ride (since he is biking a weekend ride of 20 mph (2mi per hour) *12 hours for a 12 mi bicycle ride *2days = 48 miles a weekend for both days added up is\n50 miles + 48 miles = 98 miles", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": "Rationales:\n1. The question is about Ann, a woman who was having a summer sale in a store.\n\n2. We are not going to compute the prices of each item, but we have been given the number of each item Ann bought.\n\n3. In order to compute each topped price, we will need the number of tops bought by Ann plus the number of shorts and shoes.\n\n4. We are given that Ann bought 5 pairs of shoes, so we can say: `6 pair of shoes = 2 pairs/shoe`.\n\n5. We are also given that Ann bought 2 pair of shoes. We also know that she bought 4 tops and 7 pairs of shorts.\n\n6. Knowing this, we can say that the total number of pairs of shoes, tops, and shorts must be: `(1, 2, 4, 7)`.\n\n7. We are now told that the price of each pair of shoes is $10. The price of 1 pair is `(10, 20, 30,...., 40)`.\n\n 8. We can easily tell the price of 4 pair of shoes by substituting, which will give us: `4=20=30=...=40`. This simplifies to 4 shoes for $40, and we know that Ann bought 4 tops.\n\n9. Therefore Ann bought 4 pairs of shoes, 2 tops, and 7 pairs of $7 shorts.\n\n10. So, we can substitute again to compute the number of shorts, which gives us 92.\n\n11. Multiplying the number of shoes by the price of a shoe yields  $92, which is the number of pairs of shorts Ann bought. Thus, $75 spent by Ann yielded $7 and $92, respectively, for the number of tops and shorts.\nRationale 2: There are three rationales to why Ann would need 92 pairs of shorts.  \n\n1. We know that Ann can only afford 1 pair of shoes; $6.\n\n2. When buying shoes, we always buy in pairs. In this case, Ann bought 2 pairs at $1", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "The order of the operations is a step-by-step methodology for performing mathematical calculations. In most cases, there is not a single answer in math; instead, it is about how we arrive at that particular answer. The order of operations determines which operation is performed first, which is the multiplication, and which is the division. The order of operations states that multiplication is performed before division.\n### Demonsteration:\nInput: The order of operations, what are the four basic operations in math in order?\n\nRationales:  1. The four basic math operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. Adding is the sum or total of two things, whether the two things are numbers or quantities.\n3. When addition is performed on a whole number, the sum is also a whole number. But if the addition is performed on a fraction, the sum can either be a number or a fraction, depending on what you add.\n4. When you combine two whole numbers, add their proper place values. Write down the final number with the largest number as the value for tens and the smaller numbers as the digits for the number in hundreds.\n5. When you are adding two different sets of numbers, you do not need to write down the number next to 1 as an addition, as that is assumed. When adding whole numbers, just write the largest number as the number for tens and the smaller number as the number for hundreds.\n6. Subtraction is the opposite operation of addition. Instead of adding the quantities, if you multiply by a number, you take away. The first step in subtraction is writing down the bigger number and leaving the other smaller next to it. Next, subtract the smaller number from the bigger one and write next to the bigger one.\n7. Multiplication is the basic operation, as multiplication is performed before division to make the problem more simple.\n8. Division is the opposite operation of multiplication. Next, take the smaller number (the multiplier) and divide it into the whole number. If it's a fraction, you need to multiply the whole number by the denominator and then divide the result by the numerator. When performing division, take the quotient, which is the multiplier divided by the multiplier.

So, the equation that needs to be solved to find the difference is: `3x = 2x - 1000` in which `x` represents the cost for Jessica's expenence.\n* 5. Note: This equation can be solved since the numbers in the equation are given and they always add up to the same exact number.\n* 6. After solving the equation, x will be equal to 760, so the cost of Jessica`s expense for the difference is $760.", "answer": " 7200"}

{"text": "Answer: $10\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. When one decides to use the money from a lottery to pay off debts, it is normal to assume he or she will start paying off debts from the largest to the smallest.\n\n2. This is logical.  In this case ian started with Colin, who has the highest amount and then paid less to the next person.\n\n3. Ian then proceeded to Benedict as it is the person with least debt of the remaining ones ian was told to pay.\n\n4. Benedict being the last on the list and having the least debt would mean he is entitled to the lesser amount left after paying the first and the second persons on the list.\n\n5. Hence, ian had $10 remaining after paying off the debts.\n\n### Rough Draft\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade question.\n\n## Rough Draft\n## Demonstration: \nInput:Where do humans go in cities  to be in nature?Choices:  A:movie theatre  B:university  C:park  D:alaska  E:country  Rationales:1.The question is asking where humans  tend to go in cities  if they want to  experience  nature.  2.From the given options, movie  theaters and  university  are outrightly ruled  out because they do not  have anything to do with  nature.  3.Alaska  and country are both  places where  someone can  experience nature  but they are not located  within cities.  4.Hence, the  only viable option left  is  park which fits  in the city  where humans  go to  be in  nature.

{"text": "Input: The laboratory has 20 beakers of liquid in the fume hood. Let's work out the beakers with copper:\n1. The first beaker has 30 mL of liquid. The volume is doubled to allow for error in measurement.\n2. We know there are 8 beakers with the copper in them, and the liquid is mixed. This means that all we can do is divide by 8 to find the real amount of volume in the liquid.\n3. This will leave 7.5 mL of liquid that can easily contain 22 copper ions.\n4. With only 22 coppers that can fit, the probability of finding a copper is 1:4 so we will need 20 beakers tested to find 1 copper.\n5. The final answer is 18.\nAnswer: 18\n\n### Instructions:The graph below represents a curve of the volume in gallons of gas consumed for a given number of gallons per hour in vehicle 1, for a given average fuel efficiency.\n\n### Rationales:1. The given graph represents how much gallons of gas are used per hour a car consumes.\n2. We are working with all of the vehicles together so I want to know how many hours each car takes before it hits a certain volume. 3. In order to measure the data I put the data on a line graph to make it more clear.\n4. We are going to add the volume of gas the car uses and the number of hours it takes to use them to get a simple 1 to 1 ratio.\n5. The point on the plot where the vertical line crosses the x axis is the number of gallons of gas before it used up a certain amount of fuel.\n6. The number of hours before all of the gas is used is also where the vertical line cross with the time line.\n7. Since the ratio is equal the number of gallons the car used up will also be equal to the number of hours the car was being used.\n8. So the solution is:\n    * Volume is used after X hours or Y Gallons\n\n#### Note: Y should be greater than X. \n\n    * All answers should come out even numbers.\n\n### Input\n```c++\n#include<iostream>", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "The constant rate of 2880/7 elephants/hour, or 411 elephants/hour is the rate at which the new or incoming elephants entered the Utopia national park. The total number of all the elephants in the Park plus new elephants who entered is 28980. When there is time constant, and the number of elephants is increasing, or decreasing, the rate at which the rate is increasing or decreasing is given by the equation dN/dt = r, where r is the rate or the constant at which the increment is taking place. From the given formula of the problem, we can determine that the increment or the rate is 411 = 2880- 2280(previous elephants who exited). So, we are left with 27920 elephants in totality. Since,the previous 2280 elephantes who exited the park, add at a rate of 2280/7= 320 which is the rate at which previous elephants exited the park. So, 2792-2280= 512. This means that new elephants were entering the park at a rate of 512/ 320 elephants= 1.575\n\n### Input and Initialization:Write 2 methods: one (say \"answer\") that answers the question correctly and one (say \"incorrect\") that answers the question wrongly.\n\n### Constraints: Your method answer must be in the following format [A], where A is a string.

Now she wants to know the amount of money in her pig after exactly 4 years.\n\n\n* **Demonstration**:We note that $276 is the average amount that will be in the piggy bank in each month that Sheila will be saving. Thus, in a month we will save $3,009+276=3,285 and the total after 4 years will be (3,000+($3,285*12))=(3,000+(39,430)).

The first step in solving this problem is to divide the work to be done (making 12 pizzzas) into the time it takes in steps (makeing pizza dough and putting it in the oven).\n2. If it takes 30 minutes for the pizza to be made, this means 12 pizzass are made in 360 mins. If each pizza dough takes 105 mins to be cooked, then it takes (360/105) hours for the pizza to bake.\n3. Hence, there are 3 hours to finish making 1 pizza, meaning 360 m/3 hrs= 120 m pizzas.\n4. Hence there are 120 mins to make the pizza dough (30/120= 0.25 m).\n5. If it takes 105 minutes to make pizza, then 2 pizzas would be made 0.25m + 0.25 minutes which is 50 minutes.\n6. There are (360/50) hrs which corresponds to 7.2 hours to make 2 pizzas, meaning 7.2 hours is needed to finish pizza 1 when the pizza dough is made; which in the previous step, it was said to take 0.25h.\n7. 5*7.2= 36mins, but when divided with 5 pizzas, it still takes 3.6h which corresponds to 3 hours.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "Given the information on the problem, we can conclude that the probability of Annie getting into an accident is 0.0333. This is because, according to the given information, for every 3 degrees that the temperature drops below the 32 degrees mark, the chance of skidding on icy roads increases by 5%. Thus, if temperatures are at 8 degrees, the number of degrees below 32 that Annie would skid by for every 3 degrees drop below 32 degrees would amount to 12 degrees, which is 0.5 x 5% per 3 degrees below 32. When these 12 degrees are added up, it leads to an accumulation of 60 degrees below 32 degrees. As a result, we know that every 60 degrees below the 32-degree mark is to a 0.03 probability of skidding, and if Annie does skid for another 50 degrees, that would result in a 0.016 probability which adds up to 0.03. So, Annie has a 0.0096 probability of getting into an accident. Hence, her probability of getting into a serious accident is 0.99.\n\n### Inference: In this answer, two students were given the same problem.

So, the output represents the correct average. If it was 5 miles an hour, Arlene would be doing too fast because 24 miles is far greater than 5 miles.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Arlene hiked only 24 miles in total.  This rule implies that she can't hike at a certain pace in order to cover at least that much, which is impossible.\n2. The temperature during the hike was 60 degrees, and Arlene is 5 Feet tall. 5 Feet means that she is at most 6 feet tall, but 60 degrees could result to more than that.

{"text": "If it rained over a 2-hours  time period over a garage with 3 holes, what is the combined total of water that would leak out into the garage.  Let r(t) be the rate at which water leaks from the hole at time t, and L represent the cumulative amount of water  that leaks out.  To answer the question, we have to find the rate of leakage from each hole, and cumulate them.  Since the largest hole leaks water at 3 ounces per minute, r(31) = 3(0.5) + 1.5 = 2.25 per minute.  To find the rate of leak in other holes, we assume that it is proportional to the rate in the largest hole - so the medium-size hole leaks out r_medium_hole = 2/3 of the largest hole - 1.398\nand the small hole leaks out r_{small_hole} = 1/3 of the large hole - 0.858 oz of water/minute.  To cumulate the amount of water at given moment in time, we multiply the rate of leak by time - 12*(2.25 oz) + 80*(1.398 oz) + 78*(0.858) = 89.12.  \n\n### Example:\nInput: If it rained over a two hours period over a garage  with 3 leaking roofs, what's the total amount of water, in  ounces, that would leaked out?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: We can first simplify the question by writing the above equation in terms of rates per interval rather than in rate per minute, which involves dividing 1 hour = 60 minutes by 60 to get 1 hour = 1 by definition:\n\\begin{equation}\nr(t) = 2.245\\frac{\\frac{1}{1\\times 60}}{30} + 1.365\\frac{1}{10\\times 60\\times 30} + 0.82\\frac{1}{60\\times 10\\times 3}\\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\nRationales", "answer": " 600"}

We can break down into thirds using our division method.\n`500/150=3`  \nNext we need to divide the 100ML from 150 ML to get the thirds.\n`100/15 \u2248 6`\nThe final step is multiplying each 3 from our first step and our second step by 3, since the quantity is 3rds and theres 3 cups:\n`500 / 3 * 3 = 50`\n\n### ANSWER\n1000L of water is 15L of juice, 500L of juice is 5L of cream and 5L of crema is 10L of juice.\n\n- If we have 10L of crema and 5L of juice we can make 6 150ML cups.\n\n### RATIONALES:\n\n\n### \n\n### A:\nA. 31 B. 30 C. 29 D. 28 E. 27\n\n\n### Rationales:\n\n- 15 2/3 cups are half of 30 cups. \n\n- 17 0/4 cups are half of the given number. \n\n- If you multiply 22 by 5, you get 110.\n\n- 110 / 5 is 22 cups.\n\n- 29/5 cups is 5.8 which rounds down to 5, which is equivalent to 17 2/4 cups.\n\n\n\n### A\n\nCar", "answer": " 4"}

Each school lunch costs $1.03, so one box of carrots costs $0.31, and one cookie costs $0.12. Therefore, a school lunch plus a box of carrots and a cookie costs $1.46.

{"text": "I would run at about 11 meters per hour on Friday.\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen I first saw the question, I thought about finding variables and plugging in numbers with which I can solve problems and do the answers. However, I decided to look at the problem closely to see what was the main idea behind it. I saw that Harry first ran on Monday at 10 meters per time. I did not really take into account that his times were different on different days. The next 3 days, he ran 500 meters for every day, but the last day, on Friday, he ran for 6 minutes. The next three days were at 300 meters per hour. I took my 100 minutes (300 divided by 3) and multiplied it by my 1200 minutes. I knew I had to include the 1200 which was his final minutes of the week. That multiplied into 600 and I got my actual answer in my hours in the end. I believe my answer is correct because the time he ran for one day was different than the other and he made sure that it was faster. Whenever the time he ran was a multiple of 5, he ran faster than on the previous day. His final minutes were the longest he run, so I assumed they were even faster than the 600.\n\n### Input (Part 2):  A: movie theatre\n\nB: university\n\nC: park\n\nD: alaska\n\nE: country\n\n### Demostration (Part 2):\nInput: Where do the most people eat pizza in the United States?

We know that Sam has 15 sticks, but it did not tell us how many sticks Sid and Steve have; so, we will do 15 + 12 + _______ \n3. Now, we will plug in the number 8 into the blank spot. \n4. 15 + 8 + 8 will equal 30\n5. A stick is used for each group member, so there are 2 sticks for each group member. \n6. Hence, there are 4 sticks per person, which makes it 16 per group member for their Art class activity \n\n### Instructions:Answer this question. \n\n### Demstration:\nSid has two bicycle seats. He can give you one for every four friends that you give him. For every seat that you give him, he will give you a toy and a candy bar. You need to give him three friends in order to get a seat. If you had three friends, how many candies do you get?\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question is essentially about you having three friends and you want them to get each a candy bar and a toy. I.e. Sid will give each friend a candy bar and toy from his inventory upon your request.\n2. The question then asks how many candies you get if you had three friends because of the way this is stated, it basically tells us that you have given him three friends.\n3. So, to keep the order of events, we will say that we have 3 friends that we have given to Sid. \n4. We will say that Sid has 2 bicycle seats, each friend takes one seat on a bicycle and there is 3 bicycle + 2 friends, so 5 people will be travelling on a bicycle \n5. So, 5 people will go to each location on the bicycle and they each have a candy bar and one toy for each. \n6. It is 1 candy bar and one thing for each person.\n7.", "answer": " 108"}

But when he sells the 10th bag, he has spent all the revenue that would have come from the 10th sale and that goes against the profit.\n\n3)His profit is 10%, so there is a loss at $25 per 150 bags, $25 being the cost and $15 being the revenue.\n\n4)If he sells 5 bags and it makes the profit, it will be $10. When selling 5 bags makes a profit, it means the cost of the product is less than $15 each, making selling only 5 bags make more profit.\n\n5)Since he wants to make a 10% profit, he needs to sell 5 bags and each bag will make a profit of $5 (rather than the total profit of $50). Note that this also means he needs to sell bags at a higher price of $25 each.\n\nReview:\nIn this case, the profit percent is 10.0% while the price he sold the product at is $15 per bag.\nThis means, for every sale, he spent $15 and earned $15, i.e., a profit of 150.\nBut 150 is not profit per bag but the total he earned in that 10 bags that he sold.

{"text": "The question is asking how many rounds Jane played in order to end up with 60 total points in a game where winning a round awards 10 points and losing a round costs 20 points.  There are multiple possible answers; however, by making the assumption that Jane played the maximum amount of rounds that she could, and then considering all remaining possibilities, we can find the correct answer. \n\nWe start by assuming that she played x number of rounds and played a perfect game according to our assumptions.  With this, her losses would be 2x.  She could have then only won 10 points total for her rounds.  This is impossible.\n\nWe can rule out the other options this way: 20+40=60, so x is not 20 and our next assumption that she played x2 number of rounds is thus incorrect and x must be different.\n\nWhen we run through the remainder, x3 is impossible, since 140 is larger than 60, and then x4 is not possible.  We can check these off and start looking at x4 possible numbers.  If she went for 40 more rounds, she would then have won 10 points each round and 40 points in total, which would not be enough to get her to 60.\n\nWe then look at x3.  It would be 160 points if we assume 60 points lost for 10 rounds, 60 points for 10 round, and then 30 points won for 2 rounds. Again, this would be wrong.\n\nWe can therefore determine that our next possible rounds could not be x3.  We can also rule out 5 total rounds by observing that this would not be higher, so it is impossible.\n\nThis leaves us finally looking at x2 number of rouns.  This is a perfect match, and so we know that the answer is 2 total rounds.\n\n### Your response can be a word or phrase, but should be at least half a sentence in length.\n\n### Inputs and outputs are formatted in a variety of ways.\n\n### No prompts about input or output formats.\n\n### If you do not have any questions, tell so.\n\n### Questions or support requests are posted on the", "answer": " 8"}

This would translate to 6 mins where Jim catches up.\n\n### Input 3:\nPete and Joe plan to fly from London to Los Angeles. In the first leg, they plan to fly at a speed of 800 km/h on a plane that takes off and lands on water, but because of bad weather, they have to divert to Paris. When they are ready to leave from Paris, they are not sure of the time for the next flight, so they decide to take out the following formula to evaluate their possible landing time: T = (800 km/hour) (1/10) + 1 + ((freshness of the plane)*hours of delay), h = (3 hours per day) + (210 minutes each hour). With the given information in the above formula, calculate the hours that they are delayed in Paris before their departure from the city to London, which is the end of their flight.\n\n#### Rationales\n\n1. In order to calculate the delay time of the delayed plane from the departure time of the plane to the end (London), we need four variables x, (time taken at departure from Paris), y (time from London), c (hours per day used), d(time used for maintenance), and d0 (the number of flights available per day), such that the equation is x + d(hours taken from arrival at Paris to departure from Paris) + d0 = y\n\n2. The formula x = (800km/h)10 + 1 + (d(3 hours) + 210), and it is given that the formula holds the case of x, y, d > 0. If one replaces x, d and y for 0, we get to y = x. This shows that x = y - 1. Hence, the formula is simplified to (800kmhr)10 - 1 = y -1 (and hence, x = y-1).\n\n3. Substituting y - 1 for x, the formula reduces to\n((800kmhr)/10) - 1 = y-1, which is rearranged to y =", "answer": " 20"}

The key to answering the question is understanding that if Allyn has 480 bulbs in his house that uses 60 watter hours to power, then he has to pay the cost of 6 watter hours each day.\n3. Therefore, to calculate Allyn's monthly expenses on eletricity the solution is to multiple Allyn's total number of bulbs in his houses with 30 days and then divide the answer by 60.\n4.

{"text": "Input: Brandon and Malcom both have a baseball card collection.  Malcom has more than Brandon, but after he gives half of his card to Mark, he will only have 4 cards. \n\n### Rationale:\nThere are several ways to calculate the number of cards Malcom has, but they all have to do with understanding that Malcom has 8 cards more than Brandon and he gave half of his cards to Mark. \n\nAfter that, Brandon still has more cards than Mark, so Mark still has 3 cards than what Brandon has. \n\nMalcom began this process with 28 cards and he ended it with 4 cards left.  So the number of cards he had left after he gave half of his collection to Mark was 4, but it could be 3, 2, or 1.\n\n1.  It is difficult to directly get the answer without understanding the given information and adding extra information to complete the information.\n2.  It is important that the number of cards Brandon and Mark still have are known. \n3.  We can calculate it by subtracting the number of cards Brand had from the total.\n4. In this specific question, Brandon had 20 cards. \n\nSo the number of cards Mark had is calculated as 6 (10 \u2013 4).  This is because Brandon originally had more cards than Mark and Malcom gave half of his cards away to Mark so he still has 6 of his original cards.\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: Brandon still has 14 cards, and Mark has 6.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI) is focused on designing computer and internet applications to make it convenient for people to interact with them. \n\nBecause humans are creatures who make the decisions about how to interact with computers and the internet, HCI is crucial.\n\nMost commonly, HCI is studied in terms of designing applications for personal digital devices, such as phones and laptops. \n\nHowever, when designing an application that can be accessed by a wide variety of different groups of people, such as for a website or an application used in a business or government setting, the need for HCI becomes even more present.\n\nThere are a number of human factors and other considerations", "answer": " 14"}

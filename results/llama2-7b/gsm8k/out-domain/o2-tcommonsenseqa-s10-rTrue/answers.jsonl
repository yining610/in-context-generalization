It is worth noting that $3 is an incredible amount, and the question does not ask for the exact value of the amount but rather refers to \"her money now\" in general. \n7. In conclusion, after considering the specific details of the question and analyzing the context presented, it is most likely that Alice left the bank with her 20 quaters, but the nickels were worth $3 each, resulting in a total value of about $3.\nSo the final outcome is that Alice would have $3\n\nInput: At the movie theater a person buys a ticket and a cushion, his total expense is $ 9.

The number of cars traveling on a day of the week can be determined by using the equation: \ncar_count = (days_travel / day_car_count) * days_travel\n\nAssuming that Happy Street is open on Saturday and Sunday, we can determine the total number of cars that travel down the street in a given week.\n3. On Monday, it is given that 20% fewer cars go down Happy Street than on Tuesday. As a result, this means that 20*1= 2 additional cars will go down the street on Monday. This results in: \n(90% / 5) * 6 = 6 + 2 = 8 additional cars on Monday. \n4. For Tuesday and Wednesday, we know that the number of cars go down the street will be at least as many cars as on Monday.

{"text": "1. Mary is purchasing drinks and pizzas for a party, but the question asks about the amount of change she received back from the total she paid.\n2. The answer comes in two parts, the change for the drinks and the change for the pizzas.\n3. To calculate the change for the drink, we subtract the $80 Mary spent for drinks from the $120 she received in change for the pizz payout.\n4. Therefore, the total received in change is $40.\n5. Similarly, the change for the pizza is the amount of change received for the remaining pizzas, which is $80 minus the initial amount of $200 spent.\n6.  Therefore, the total change received in cash back is $120.\nSo the final change she gets back is $12\n\nInput: What is a part of a human body?

Two times a month can be expressed as \"2 times\" or \"2 x\", and \"times\" can be understood as number of times. \n4. Therefore, our input \"2 times a month for 3 hrs each time\" equals 24 times. \n5.

He can purchase $3 worth of peanuts with $3 in change, and $28 worth of peanuts remain. \n3. It is unclear what Frank plans to do with the remaining $28. It is likely that he wants to eat the entire amount of peanuts he bought within one week, however, the question does not provide any additional information on his planned consumption schedule. \n4. Suppose he plans to consume all the peanuts he bought in a day, he can spend $28 worth of his money daily. \n5. The question does not specify whether he plans to spend this amount of money to purchase $28 worth of additional peanuts every day, or whether instead he plans to spend this money on other items besides peanuts every day. \n6. If he plans to buy $28 worth of other items every day then he can spend just $28 per day, rather than $40 overall. \n7. Because the question does not provide enough information to determine a consumption rate for his money other than assuming he plans to consume the entire amount of peannuts he bought, it is necessary to make assumptions for either purchasing peanuts every day or other items every day and then determine the resulting consumption rates. \n8. If he plans to purchase peanuts every day then he needs to spend $3 to purchase $3 worth each day, resulting in a daily consumption rate of $0.43\n9. Alternatively, if he planned to purchase other items each day then the daily consumption rate would be $1.42.\n10.

The question is asking the amount that Bran needed to pay for himself, without the assistance of the scholarship. \n3. The question is asking whether Bran needed to pay an additional 3 months of additional fees.\n1. To calculate the amount Bran needed to contribute to pay his tuitions, we would subtract the amount of the scholarship ($30) from the full tuition ($90) to arrive at the total amount Bran needed to contribute ($60).\n2. To determine what portion of the tuition fee Bran needed to supply himself, we would compare the full tuition ($70) to the amount of the scholarships ($30) to arrive at $40 that Bran needed to pay himself.\n3.

The question asks whether it's better to take the longer, harder test or the shorter, easier one. \n2. For the first choice, if you fail, you have nothing to lose by taking the shorter, easier test. You can get the guaranteed passing grade and be done with it, instead of taking yet another test. However, if you take the easier test and do well, then you fail the harder test, you will be worse off. \n3. For the second choice, if you fail the longer, harder test, you will have failed the harder test regardless of whether you take the shorter test or not. In that case, it makes more sense to take the shorter test to ensure you pass the easier test and get the guaranteed passing grade. \n4. The answer is number two, that we should take the exam that offers the guaranteed passing grade and avoid taking the exam we know we will fail.\nSo the final choice is take the exam that can guarantee passing.", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "1. For Harrison, croissants are not a regular part of his diet, but rather a special occasion treat. \n2. To get a sense of how many croissants he might buy in a year, his total yearly expenditure on croissants can be determined by multiplying the average price of a croissant per day by the number of days in a year.\n3. In Harrison's example, the average price of a single croissant is 3.50 per day and the number of days in one year is 365. \n4. Thus, the total yearly expenditures for croissants are $1362.50 in Harrison's case. \n5. Therefore, if one wishes to estimate the total yearly expenses for croissants, one can use a simple calculation of the average price of a pair of croissants at $2.00 per day, multiplied by the number of days of the year, which is 365, to estimate the total year's expenditure at $850.00. \nSo the final answer of $850.50 is the amount of money Harrison will spend on croissants if he purchases a regular croissant for $3.5 on Saturdays and an almond croissants for $5.5 on Sundays.\n\nInput: How many cents are in 38 dollars?\nOutput:1) In the question \"How many cents are in $38?\", $38 refers to the amount of dollars that the consumer is looking to spend on a particular item. \n2) The answer to  the question is not simply 38 cents, but rather the amount 38 dollars, meaning $38 is the amount of dollars spent, and 38 cents is the amount of change provided to customers. 3) Therefore, the response to the question \"How many cent are in $38? 4) The answer is \"38\", as the total amount to be spent is $38, not 38 cents.\nSo the final answers is $38\n\nInput: Sam says that Aunty is about 250 km from here.

The problem is similar to the previous problem, but it involves finding the year when Connie's grandmother was born given additional information about her siblings and the gap between them. \n2. The question asks to find the year in which Connie's grandfather was born and given the year in which Connice's grandfather was birth, the year of her grandmother' s birth can be calculated by subtracting these two numbers. \n3. Using the formula for finding the difference in year in between two events is y_2 - y_1. For the initial information, we know her older brother was born in the year 1932 and her older sister was born 4 years later in 1934, the difference between these two numbers are 2, so the initial answer is 1932-1936 = -4 years. \n4. Knowing that the age difference is twice as much as the initial difference, meaning that her older brother was born four years before, the age difference is twice the initial difference or: 2x(2 years) = 8 years. \n5. Taking these two pieces of information, we can now calculate the missing number. Since we know the answer is not 1930, because her older brother was born two years before her older brother was born, we know the answer is larger than 1934. \n6. Since the younger one has the same age as the older brother, then the year in between the younger brother and the oldest sister is four years. \n7. According to the calculation, the year in between the oldest sister and the oldest brother, is negative four years, or, the number is 1936 - 1932 = -4. \n8.

{"text": "Firstly, we need to establish the pricing structure of the items sold. The question states that a shirt costs $1, and a pair of jean costs twice as much - $2. We also need to know how many of each item are sold. The question states there are 20 shir ts and 10 pairs jeans.\nNext, we can calculate the total cost of the items sold, which is the product of their prices. $10 for 20 shir t s and $20 for 10 pairs of j eans = $200.\nFinally, to determine the total profit of the clothing s tart, we will subtract the cost from the total sales. $200 - $200 = $0. Thus, the clothing store will earn no profit if all shirts an d jeans are sold.\n\nInput: \nA clothing store has 12 dresses in stock. Five of the dresses are currently marked down by 25% from their original price. Another 6 dresses are out of stock. The store must mark one dress down by 50% so that the cost of the marked down dress as a whole matches that of the out-of-stock dresses. What price must the store mark the dress down to? \nOutput: The key to this kind math problem is to focus on the original prices of the items and the percentages that apply to each item.\nTo arrive at the price of the marked down dress, the price of the out-of stock dress must be determined.\n- Subtract 25% from the price of each marked down dress.  $100 - $25 = $75. Therefore, 5 dresses cost $500.\n- Subtact 50% from the price of one unmarked dress, thus reducing it to 75%. Add 25% to the five marked dresses, then subtract 25%, returning to the original price.  $125 - 50% = $68.75.\n- Add the cost of the markedly down dresses, which is 10% less than the cost of the out-of -stock dress, $500. Thus, the price of the markedly downedress must be $525.856.", "answer": " 400"}

What number can I try to call her on the 11 th time?\nOutput: The first clue you should consider is the fact that your friend left her phone in her parked car which is out of fuel in a spot that is most likely unpaved or dirt and gravel road, as you could only attempt to call her in this context multiple times in succession on a cellular phone. \nThe 5th time you can call her is the 10th time she receives the call.\nTherefore, your options are the following:\n* 2nd (62), 4th (68), 6th (72), 8th (74), 10th (76)\nSo, the answer is 76 (16 + 60).\n\nInput: How many 7's are there in the number 6763?

We then multiply the distance covered by Tom by two-thirds (since he spent half his time running at four times the speed he initially would have used, and the other third running at the same speed)\n9. The final equation for Tom's total distance covered is speed x time spent running x running time / 2 / 3\n10. Therefore, the full distance covered by tom is: (2mi/hr) x (2hr) x (2mi/hr / 4hr) / 2/3/ = 4mi.\nSo, in the end, Tom ran 4 miles in 2 hours.\nThe final answer is 4 mi.", "answer": " 12"}

We can use FOIL method to do the sum (First, Outside, Inside and Last).\n3. So we sum up the first and the last, since Outside is 8, we sum up with it first.\n4. Inside is 6 thus we sum up with it later.\n5. The First and the Last cubic roots (cuberoots) are 9 and 6.\n6. Therefore, since addition is commutative, the sum of the cuberoots must be the inverse of the sum of the number cuberoots (ex. 4+3=1).\n7. The inverse of 9 and 6 is 34.\n8. We substract both 9 and 6 from 34 to get the difference, which is 28.\nSo the sum of first and last cuberoots are 28.\n9. 28 is a double of six as 14, which means six times two is 12.\n10.

The only other possible locations for a shoe are either within a house (in the hallway or in a bedroom, for example) or outside a house (in a driveway, park, etc., that could potentially cause confusion with a garage). \n7.)

These are: 1) player gets two sixes, and rolls again. 2) player gets a number, then rolls again. \n\nLet us call these two numbers A and B, respectively. Therefore, for the first roll, we can say that Player A got two sixes (2A). Let us call the new number (A+B) that player gets after the first roll. \n\nIf we apply the question to roll the marble twice and get a six the first time: if the player rolled a six the first time, then the outcome will be: 1) A+B = 2A (the original two sixes) and roll again. 2) A+B = A (rolls a 6) and roll again.\n\nIf the outcome is A+B = 4, then player will choose to roll again because of the possibility for more 6's \n\nIf the player rolling 2 marbles and rolled a 6, and chose to ROLL again with possibility of rolling a 6 and 2 sixes.\nAfter rolling the second time \nFor example: Player could get a 5 and choose to roll again.\nOn the 3rd roll, the player has a possibility of a 6 or a 5 and choose roll again, but the player could also get a 0 (or no dice) and stop.\n\nAnswer 2\n\nIf we rewrite the question: The player rolls the marble twice and gets a 6", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "1. The question asks how much farther Kyle's throw was than Parker's, and we can answer this by comparing the distance that Parker's throw was from the total distance of Kyle's throw. \n2. We know that Parker threw the ball 24 yds (16 + 5). This becomes our X term.\n3. We know that Grant threw 150% more (3X) than Parker, so 3(24) = 72% more, which makes our X = 80 yds, since 80 + 24 = 104 (24 yds is 60% of the 80 yds). \n4. Kyle's throw is 2X = (4X) = 6X = 192% more than Parker, so Kyle's throw must be more than 192% of the ball's original throw (392%), making Kyle's throw 216% of 24 = 50% more than Parker. So the calculation is 50/24, or 2 x 25%.\n5. Therefore, we can simply answer that Kyle threw 25 percent farther because if Kyle's throw were 25% more than Parker's, then he must have thrown 50% more, or twice as far. \nSo the final answer would be 25% because Kyle threw twice as much as Parker", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "The question asks about the amount of money saved by a person who saves a portion of his or her income.  The information provided includes the person's yearly income, as well as the percentage of that income that is saved, and sources of additional income. \nTo answer the question, we need to calculate the total amount saved based on the information provided. \nThe question provides us with $600 in income from mowing yards, $250. 00 in income from his birthday/holiday, $150. 0 in income from selling old video games, and $150 in income from odd jobs.  The total amount of income received is $1,400, which means that Chad earns $1,150 after saving 40% of his total income. \nWe use these values to calculate the amount saved.  To calculate the total amount saved, add up the two types of income that were received, and subtract the amount saved. In this case, the total income is $1,450 and the amount saved is $560, so the total amount saved is $550. \nTherefore, the amount saved is $0. 75, which represents a saving rate of 56%. \n\n\nInput:  Which of the following numbers is larger: 1804 or 3782?

{"text": "1 The question refers to a canyon's strata, which is a layered rock formation, typically produced by sedimentation and erosion, and made up of different types of rock. \n2. The canyon's layers are 25 in total, which may seem like a large number, but it becomes relatively simple to answer the remaining questions by taking into account that there are two different types of rock in each layer, and thus the number of different types of rock in the canyon is 50.\n3. When referring to the strata in the canyon, there are five different types of rock, in five different layers, which makes a total of 25 different types of rock.\n4. In addition, the rock types that make up each of these layers are 40% sandstone, 20% limestone, 20% quartz, 20% shale, and 10% of various other types of rock.\n5. To determine which types of rock represent only one layer in the strata, we can add up the percentages of each type of rock and multiply by 25, which will total 40%, or five layers. \n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is that only five of the 25 layers in the canyon's stratification are made of only one type ofrock.\nSo the final analysis is that only five of those 5 layers will only contain a single type of rock. \nNow to find out exactly what this is we can go through\n40% \u00d7 25 = 10 %\n(20% \u00d7 5) + 2 % =10%\n12.5% x 5 =10%\nso the answer is that only one layer out of the rest, which is 03%\nSo from the 25 layers there is only 01% that will have only a single type of rock\nSo the final analysis shows that one layer of 01% out of the total of 25 layers will only contain one type of rock, making the answer C: 1 layer in total", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "This question involves solving a multiplication equation. To answer this question, we need to understand how many minutes it takes to clean each key, the amount of time needed to complete the assignment before dinner, the amount of time left when the assignment is complete, and the total amount of time needed to clean the remaining keys and leave enough time to eat before dinner.\n1. The time needed to clean each key is given to be 3 minutes.\n2. The amount of time needed to finish the assignment before dinner is given to be 10 minutes.\n3. The amount of time left before dinner is equal to the amount of time needed before dinner minus the amount of time needed for the assignment.\n4. The remaining time needed to clean the keys and leave enough time for dinner is given to be the sum of the assignment time and the amount of time left.\nThus, the amount of time required to clean the remaining keys plus leave a sufficient amount of time for dinner is given by 13 minutes.\nThus, by plugging in our values, we find that 13 minutes are needed to clean the keys plus enough time to leave for dinner since 10 minus 3 equals 7, 7 minus 3 is equal to 4, and 4 plus the time needed for the assignment equals the desired result of 13.\nSo the final conclusion is that 13 minutes is needed in total.\n\nInput: How tall is the giant if the giant has the same height as his sister?

A: runs away with the car 2.B: tries to sell you a car 3.C: helps you where the car is 4.D: asks you to move 5.E: tells a friend to move the car\nOutput: \n1. The first step must be to follow the path that leads to the house, since it is the only path that leads to the car. \n2. At the house, the person may try to sell the car or ask you to move to allow access to another car. \n3. The person is most likely to be helpful because it is the only person who could be expected to know where the car is. \n4. In any case, the conversation with the person will likely involve a suggestion to move, since he already occupies the field or the house. \n5.

The total number of students in all the classrooms combined is equal to the number of desks in all the classrooms. This is because each student can use only one desk, so the total number of students cannot exceed the total number of desks. \n4.

{"text": "This is the classic vampire problem. We can see that each morning there are 295 living people, which means that each night after the first night there should be 299 people turned into vampires. This does not change, because each turn converts people to the undead. The night after the first night, there are 55 more people who need to be converted into vampires. The next night, there are 49 more people who need to converted to vampires. At this point we can see there are 29 new vampires for every 5 people who get turned. Since there are only a few hundreds people, after a few rounds we see that 2 people get turned each morning. In a vampire movie, this might translate to 2 people being torn apart and eaten. In the world of numbers, it basically boils down to one person dying and one person becoming a vampire.

{"text": "To find the head start time, we can calculate the number of seconds that the turtle needs to win the race. \n1. Let's first note that the question is asking about a 20-foot race, and not a 20-second race.\n2. Secondly, we need to calculate how long it would take for the animal running the fastest, Mark's hare, to travel 20 feet in relation to the slower moving animal, Mark's turtle.\n3. We know that the hare is moving at 10 feet/2 seconds while the turtle is moving at 1 feet/2 seconds. \n4. We can then cross-multiply between the feet/second ratio and the seconds/race in order to find what it takes for the hare to travel 200 (which is the result of multiplying 20 by a 2) feet to 220 (the result of multiplying the hare's velocity by the distance traveled. \n6. To find the difference, we will need to subtract 220 feet (the total distance the hare needs to travel) from 20 feet (the distance the turtle is already ahead).\nSo the final answer will be A: 5 seconds\nSo the final answer would be that the turtle will only be at a tie if it reaches Mark's hare at a headstart of 5 seconds.\n\nInput: You\u2019ve been given the task of designing a new type of container for carrying liquids. You decide to make the opening of the container 2cm in diameter. What is the maximum volume of liquid this container can hold?\nOutput: This question asks that a new type of container be designed for carrying liquids, and the opening diameter is given. We can solve this by making a conversion to calculate the container volume in cubic centimeters. \n1. In order to determine how to convert the answer, we first need to convert the opening diameter from centimeters to decimal inches.\n2. This can be done by dividing the number in centimeters by 2.54. \n3. We can then multiply this ratio with the diameter in inches to find the volume of liquid that our container could hold. This volume is notably smaller than the initial value of 2 cubic centimeters, however", "answer": " 18"}

Since there are 5 days in total, the final answer is 600/5 = 120 minutes per day\nb) We can also compute the number of hours by multiplying the minutes per day by 60 due to the use of 60 minutes per hour in the United States. The multiplication gives us 120 x 60 = 7200 minutes, which is converted to hours, resulting in 120 minutes x 60 =  7200 minutes in total.\nc) In conclusion, John needs to watch 120 minutes each day or 7200 total minutes to finish the show in 5 days because there is a 5 days-long task and 20 episodes.\n\n\nInput: There are two ways to cut a cake.

{"text": "1. This is a tricky question because the math involved is complicated, but luckily, there is one possible solution that makes sense. \n2. The key insight is that the total combined time is made up of three separate categories--the combined time spent practicing, the combined time spent throwing tantrums, \n3. and the combined time spent singing. According to the question, the amount of time spent singing is 6 minutes, so we can subtract 6 minutes. \n4. Subtracting 6 minutes from the total combined time gives us 30 minutes, and dividing this by the individual amounts gives us the total combined time of 6 minutes for practicing, 21 minutes for throwing tantrums, but, most importantly, a combined time of singing of 4 minutes. \n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the solution is not A: 1 minute, B: 63 minutes, C: 64 minutes, or D: 71 minutes, but instead E: 4 minutes.\nSo the final answers are A.

You paid $25 to park there. How much do you think this parking space was worth?\nOutput: Since the parking citation is at most $65, we can assume that the value of the parking space is somewhere between $0 and $65. We can make this assumption based on the context of the parking citation and the fact that the parking space is not free. Also, the fact that the parker paid $25 suggests that the space was not cheap and the price of $25 suggests a value between $0 and $25. To determine the value of the space, we can use the greedy algorithm. We will start from $0 and guess the next value, assuming that it is greater than the previous guess (we will try to find the value that puts the total amount of money spent by the parker and the parking citation as close to $70 as possible). By trying different guesses, we can eliminate values that are below the parking citation price ($65) and keep values that are greater than the parking citation ($69). In this case, the value is somewhere around $30-$40, since the parking citation cost is $69.

{"text": "Firstly, we need  to determine how to solve this type of problem. \nWe can use the principle that the area of a shape is equal to the product of the height and the width of the shape. \nHence, we can solve the problem by breaking it up into separate problems, first determining the width of the drift and then determining the height. \n1. To determine the width of the drifts at any time before the snow stops falling, we can subtract the width of the driff after the previous snowstorm and divide by two because that is halfway between the first day and the next day. \n2. To determine the height of the drift at any time before the end of the final snowstorm, we can multiply today's height by the number of days until the snowstorm ends. \n3. Therefore, at the end of the second day, the widht d =  1/2(1 + 34) = 16 inches. \n4. At the end of the third day, the width, d = (16 + 18)\u20442 = 20 inches.\n5.

{"text": "1.\"Bella has two times...\" It is important to note that the word \"two\" may be interpreted as a simple statement of quantity (e.g., \"Bella has two times two times two\"), but it is necessary to clarify in this instance whether \"two times as much\" means \"two times as many\" or \"two times more\" (e.g., if Bella has 60 marble but wants to have 61 marbles, the statement \"she also has 20 times as many frisbees\" implies that she needs 20 more marbles to reach her desired total of 61).\n2. To find the missing item, we simply need to subtract the total number of items from the desired total. In this case, Bella has 61 marbles and 61 - 60 = 1 frisbee, so she needs 1 more frisbee to reach her desired total.\n3. To determine the remaining numbers, we need to subtract the number of frisbees from 60. First, we need to determine how many times the desired total (61) is equal to 2/5 times the remaining number. Bella's desired total is 61, so 2/5 of it = 0.4, which is 1/5 of the total, meaning that the number of times it can be expressed equates to 1/5. 0.4 times 2/5 (of 60, which we'll call 2) = 0.4/5 times 2, which simplifies to 1/5 times 2 = 0.4 times Bella's number of frisbee. The total number she has is 0.4(60 +...) = 0.4 * 6 + 2 = 2.8 times the number of frisbes.\n\nGiven that \"she also has 60 marable, we know that 2.8 is less than or equal to 60, so the new number needed is 2.8 - 60 = -58.\n58 times the old number of frisbe (60) = the final number of frisbe she has 58*60 = 3424.", "answer": " 140"}

We start by determining the monthly insurance premium by dividing the yearly insurance premium of $800 by 12: $66.67. 2. The monthly fuel cost is calculated by multiplying the vehicle's gas mileage rate of $27 by its average yearly mileage of $7,500: $133.75. 3. The monthly speeding fine is calculated by multiplying 41.66 (the speed limit minus the actual speed of the car in miles per hour) by the insurance premium of 66.67: $28.59. 4. The monthly gas cost is the sum of the monthly gas mileage rate of the car and the monthly fuel cost, which is calculated by multiplying $27 by $7500: $731.25 5. The monthly fine cost is the sum of $28.55 (the speeding fine) and $217.14 (the monthly gas expense minus the monthly gas cost), which", "answer": " 80"}

Now, if she spend 1680 minutes on the violin practice, for how long she practice piano?\n\n```\nLet\u2019s think like this. She spend 120 x 20 = 2400 minutes on the piano practice a month. (In other word, she practice piano six hours a month.)\nThen subtract 2400 from 1680, we can get 480 minutes\n```\n\n3. Multiply 480 with 4 weeks, we can get total time she practice piano in one month is 1920 minutes.\n4. We want to calculate total time Carolyn practice violin every month. So \n\n```\nFirst, how many hours she practice per a week on violin and total 10 weeks a month.\n10 weeks x 6 day a week x 3 three times = 180 hours on violin per month.\n```\n\n5. Add total time she practice piano with total time she practice violin;\n\nFinally, she practice violin for 1920 + 180 = 2100 minutes a month with four weeks.\n\nSo the final answer for each week is 2100/4 = 525 minutes.\n\nIn total, she spend 525x4 = 2104 minutes a month.\nSo the final total answer is 13,804 minutes a month, or about 230 hours!\nThis is a really long time for a person who practices a double and violin.", "answer": " 1920"}

Since the living room has a total area of 50 square meters, it is necessary to take into account the number of coats that must be applied. \n6.

{"text": "Firstly, we need the denominator and numerator of the ratio: 5:7.The denominator of this fraction is 7, the number of girls in the family. \nThe numerator of this fraction is how many people we are dividing, which is 5 boys. \n5 boys divvied by 7 girls is 0.67, or 7/10. This is our 1st choice. Since we can round up and down to the nearest quarter, we divide by 10 to get 7/10 rounded down: 0.35. \nThere are 40 boys and 67 girls in total. From math, the total number of children in a family is how much the sum of a fraction equals the original numerator: 40. So, if we add 40 to 0.35, the answer will be 0.75. The boys' share is 5*0.75= $3750. So the money given to each boy is $3750/67= $56.

Nate could have found his car in either section within a certain number of minutes based on the time spent walking per row.\n4. Using our knowledge about the number of cars per row and the time it takes to walk past each one, we can determine how many minutes it would take him to find his car.\n5. We can solve for the number of minutes it took Nate to find his car by dividing the number of minutes it would take him in section G by how many rows in the section and repeating the process in section H.\n6.

The question asks how much it would cost per week, rather than per day.\n2. We can calculate the cost per day by dividing the total cost by the number of days in a week.\n3. To find the total cost, we multiply the admission price by the number of days.\n4. The admission price of the beach varies from day to day, so we need to take into account the cost per day to determine the total cost.\n5. To find the days in a week, we subtract Sunday and Friday and add Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. For example, if the days of the week were Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, then we would add Monday and Tuesday to get 5 total weeks.\n6. To get the cost per day, we divide the total by 5.\n7.

This is a special case of the game 20 Questions, where Amanda starts out with 14 and we know the end result after 12 questions.\n4. Using Bayesian inference, we can determine the answer using conditional probabilities.\n5. A reasonable assumption is that Amanda starts with all of the marbles in the bag, other than the ones she started out with, and that Mabel is at the end of her turn after getting 12 questions. \n6. Therefore, we can say that Amanda and Mabel each have 3 marbles. \n7. But this means that we still need to find out how many times Mabel has twice as many marbles.\n8. The first statement is 12 is equal to 1x, 2x, or 5x. Since we now have the number of questions we need to ask to get to Mabel, we can determine the number of options for Amanda. \n9. From there, we can determine that the number of marbles that Mabel has is greater. If Amanda's answer were 2, then Mabel would have 6 marbles. \n10.

This gives us 44 inches.    2. The second way to think about this question is to think about each cut as making an equal amount of wood, like a sliced candy bar. Therefore, the first two cuts must be one inch each, the third cut must be 3-6 inches, since 3+2 = 5 and 6-", "answer": " 2"}

Patients with special dietary requirements \n3. Patients requiring extra time to serve dinner\n4. Patients requiring no extra time to serve dinner \n5. Assuming that Missy starts with her fastest group, she can serve the patients with standard care requirements in 5 minutes.\nIt takes an additional 20% of the serving time to serve patients with special dietary needs. \nThus, for each patient with special dietary requirement, Missy adds 20% more time to her serving time, or 100% of 5 minutes. \nIn other words, Missy requires 5 more minutes to serve each patient with special dietyary requirements.\n6. With 12 patients, and an additional 5 minutes per person, Missy will require 60 minutes to serve her patients with special dietry requirements. In the time remaining, she can serve the standard care patients in 5 minutes.  Thus Missy needs an additional 2 minutes to serve the patients. \n7. When combined, the time it takes to serve standard care patients and the additional 2 minutes required for special dietery patients, she has 27 minutes left. \n8. In this final 27 minutes, an additional 200% more time is required, because each patient is on the 3rd serving group (patients with special dietery needs), requiring another 100% more time on each meal. \n9.

{"text": "1. First of all, we need to calculate the total box office revenue made by the film. The film made $120 million for its opening weekend, and 3.5 times more during its entire run. Since we do not know the exact time period during which the film was released, \nwe can assume that the film was released for three months and that it made $150 million before it stopped showing in the movie theater.\n2. To calculate the box office revenue, we begin with the box office revenue made for the opening weekend:\n```\n120/3=40\n```\nWe then want to multiply the three days by 8, because they are considered a week, so it would be 8 * 40 = 320\n```\n320+150=470\n```\nTherefore, the total box office revenuemade is 470 million. \n2. We then have the total revenue made by the movie, $612 million.  We can then calculate what the production company made for this film using the following formula:  ```(Total Revenue - Total Cost)/Total Revenue``` \n3. We can substitute in the $612 million box office revenue and the $60 million cost to arrive at $452 million for the net income from this film.\nSo the final profit for the production company is 60% of $452 million, which is $268.4 million.\n\nInput:If there are 20 people in a meeting, how many people are female?

The red car can travel at twice the rate of the green car; the green car can travel at 8 the rate of the blue car; and the blue car can travel at 100 miles per hour. We can simplify this as Dale has a car that can travel at 128 miles per hour. The other cars have speeds that are multiples of this value. We also know that Dale's yellow car is broken and cannot move. Therefore, Dale has a car, the red one, that can travel at 240 miles per hour.\nSo the final data is (128,240) that the red car can travel at 2 times the speed of the green car, but the green car can travel 16 times the speed of blue car.\n\nInput: Who was the first leader of the Soviet Union?

{"text": "1) First, we need to understand that this is a rate question.\n2) In order to buy a game costing $60, Bucky needs to save up $60 - (5*$5) - (6*$4) = $26\n3) According to the question, 60% were blue-gill and the rest were trout (55% and 45% can be rearranged to 5 and 4). \n4) There are 5 fish in all, so the blue-gill:trout ratio is about 4:1 (which is actually equivalent to 20:5, in simplest form). 5) Based on these calculations, we can infer that Bucky needs to save $98 to buy the game.\nSo the final worded answer is: If 60% of his funds came from trout (not necessarily true since he can also go fishing other areas), then the blue-gill money is $5*55% = $28.5. If, on the other hand 45% of his funds came in from trout (not always true since it does not exclude other income from other places or events), then the trout money is $5*45% = $23. The rest of the money would have to come from blue-gill, about $60 - $23 = $37. We also know that there were 5 fish all together, so to determine the number of blue-gill, we add the 5 and 4 which makes 9. In other words, 9 blue-gills means that a blue-gill is worth $4.7. With these figures, we can calculate his overall budget as: $60 - $4.3 - $2.8 = $98. Therefore, the correct answer is 98/100, which equals $98.\n\nSo the final wording answer is: Bucky needs to save about $98 to buy this game.", "answer": " 2"}

First think of a way to simplify the equation by subtracting all the possibilities for giving away half of the remaining cand -ies to his best friend which is: (5/2) = 5/2 - (5/2) - (5/2).\n3. From here 5/2 is equal to the number of gummy bears his best friend received and 5/2 -5/2 is equal t the number of gummy candies that went to his best friend (0).\n4. Then 5/2 = 2.5.\n5. Therefore 2.5 - 0 = 2.5. \n6. Therefore 104.\nSo the final is 104\n\nInput: In a certain city, 30% of the people vote for a democrat. 80% of the people who don\u2019t vote for a democrat vote for a republican. 10% of those who do not vote for a republican vote for the libertarian party. How many people vote for a libertarian party?\nOutput: 3. The question asks, out of all the people who did not vote for a democrat or republican, then x% of them voted for the libertarian party and that is 0.1.\n2. Then x = 0.1 * 0.80 = 0.08.\n3. Then y = (1 - x) * 0.10 = 0.10.\n4. Therefore, answer is 10% of all the people who didn\u2019t vote for a republican voted for the Libertarian party so = 0.01.\n5. Therefore 3 ( 0.90 + 0.10 )\n6.

{"text": "1) In this problem, the numbers of books owned by Harry and Flora represent additive information, while the number of books owned by Gary represents multiplicative information. It is given that Harry has 50 books, Flora has twice as many as Harry, and Gary has half of Harry's number of books. \n2) Let us start by considering the information of Harry and Flora independently. The first step is to determine the number of books Harry owns. We can use the information of Harry to deduce the number of books Flora owns. Based on what is known about Harry and Flora, we can conclude that Flora owns the same number of books as Harry minus 1 (25 books). We then move on to consider the information of Flora and Gary, using the same deductive reasoning. From the information of Flora and Harry, we conclude that Flora owns twice as many books than Harry owned (25) and that Harry owned the same number of books that Flora owned (25). Similarly, from the information about Flora and Gary, we can conclude that Flor owns 25 books and that Gary owns 25/2 books. We can now use one final step to determine the total number of books in the three family members' libraries by combining what we have already discovered about each individual family member.\n\nLet n stand for Harry's number of book. \nThen,Flora's number of book can be represented by 2n and so does Gary. \nThat is, n = 50, 2n = 100, and (2n)/2 = 125. \nSolving the above equation gives 50 = 2n and 100 = 2n.\nThus, n = 5, 2n =10, (2n)/2=10.\nTherefore, Harry has 50, Flora has 100, Gary has 125, and the three of them own 280 books together.

The 2nd statement is that he only takes 2 days of recovery.  There are 3 options for the 3rd statement: Option A: The man eats the same amount of chicken as his son. Option B: The son consumes 0.50 pounds of chicken per week. Option C: The man consumes more chicken than his son.  From these 3 statements, the answer is obvious that man has to recover the loss of chicken in his diet and thus eat 1.0x1.5 = 1.5 pounds of chicken to achieve the same level of food as before.  And the final answer is, he will recover after 7 days.\n\nInput: At what temperature can a piece of dry ice melt?

{"text": "1) First, we need to figure out how the problem can be set up in terms of equations, then rearrange the equation to solve for the variable X.\n2) One way to do this is to first find the total number of calories from added sugar that Mark took in one day. This is the sum of the calories from the soft drink and the bars of candy. \n3) Since soft drinks typically contain a higher caloric content than candy, Mark's overall intake of added sugar calories is going to be higher for a soft drink than the candies.\n4) So let's assume that the total calories from added sugar for the soft drink and the candy is 2500 + (65%) * 25 = 2825 calories. \n5) Since the recommended intake for added sugar is 150 cals, Mark should be able to take in 2825 - 150 = 2675 extra calories from added sugar in total (2825 - (2675 / 100)).\n6) Then if his take in is 150% of this amount, he can take in 418.75 more calories from added sugar than the recommended amount.\n7) This means that he can take in 2802.75 added sugar calories total, instead of the recommended 2825. \n8) Therefore Mark can take in 94 additional bars of candy that contain 25 added sugar calories each.\n9) So the final answer is 94 bars of candy.\n\nInput:Which of these two statements contains a word that means the same as the word'miles'?

If Theodore is working full-time, we should multiply his earnings by 50. \n3) According to the information provided, Theodore is crafting 10 stone statutes costing $20 each and 20 wooden sculptures that cost $5 each every month. We also know that he pays 10% of those sales in taxes, which means that each month he earns $2250. \n4) To calculate his total earnings we will need to divide his earnings by his production costs. This means that his total earnings each month come out to $11,250 dollars. \nSo the final answer in case Theodore work full-time is$2250$+ $11,205= $13,455 dollars per month.\n\n### You might have seen this: \nInput:How many ways can you choose a book among three books, two computers, four pencils, and two pens?\nOutput: \nThis has a pattern, the number of letters in the answer is the number of items in that category.

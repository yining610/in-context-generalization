If Briana rotates 2 times, what is the relationship between how much each person rotates? Choices: A: 1 less than the distance from Briana's initial position B: 1 greater than the distance from Brien's initial position C: equal distance from Briana D: equal distance from Brien' E: none of the given choices\nRationales:\n1. The relationship expressed in this question is a combination of rotation and turning.\n2. The circle must be turned to the same direction, as it is in the same position each time. If the center is where the rotation changes direction, the rotation would be one of turning left or right.\n3. Therefore, no one is rotating more than the other. The circle is rotating equally to its direction, and Briana is turning 1 less than the others. The amount of rotation is the same for everyone, so the second rotation (for both Briana and the others) have the same rate of rotation. However, the difference in rotation between Briana and Tommy is one rotation. \n4.

{"text": "The second ball was three times as large as Joy's first ball, meaning that it had a circumference of 3x the circumference of the first ball. The equation for a circle's circumference then becomes C = 2 *\u03c0 * r = \u03c0r(h + r).\n\nFor the area of a circle, A = \u03c0r2, and the surface area of a cylinder is 2\u03c0rh, where h is the height. For the first ball, the circumference is C1 = 2 * \u03c0 * r1 = \u03c0r1(h1 + r1) and the surface area is A1 = \u03c0 r12.\n\nThen the third ball is a cylinder, and the equation above becomes C2 = 2 * 2\u03c0 * r2 = 2\u03c0r2(h2 + r2). Finally, for our second ball, the circumference becomes C2 = (3 * 2\u03c0) * (r1 * r1) = \u03c0 * r1 * (3r1 + r1), and the surface area becomes C2 = 3 A1 = 3 2\u03c0 r12).\n\nWith this, we know that the surface area of the second ball is (3 * \u03c0) * (r2 * r2) = \u03c0 * (3r2 * r2). Subtracting the first ball, we get (6 * r2 * r2). The volume of the cylinder is then (r2 * r * 2h)(6 * r2 *r. Finally, we have V2 = r2 * r * 12(6 * r2 * 12r) = 3r2 *18 * r = 3r2 (18r) = 27 * 18) = 48. So the surface area of the ball is also the volume of the cylinder, and we end up answering with V2(48)(27) = 48 * 27 * 48).\n\n### Output:360 feet.\n\n### Rationale:Using the formula for surface area, we can calculate that each ball is roughly 10 feet in diameter. Then we know that Joy used 27 feet to make the third ball, which is significantly more than her first ball. The second ball then has to", "answer": " 18"}

With this information, you will be able to answer the question. By making the process repetitive, the ratio is always 2:8 (or a four to eight ratio) for each time. In total, you will need 14 ounces of oil.\n\n### Solution:\nThe question states the following: `Sonja makes her peanut butter from six ounces of peant's nuts and eight ounces of oil in a blender.`\n\nTo determine how many ounces of vegetabl oil she used in total, we must first determine how much oil she used for every one time she made the batch. The process for every one time (for all six times), Sonja used two ounces of blended oil and eight ounces in the final product. \n\nFollowing the process description given, Sonja's recipe is like the recipe for cake that states four cups of flour, one cup of milk, and one egg. To make six cakes, you will need six times of each ingredient (6 * (4 * 1) * 1 = 24).\n\nSo, to count the ounces of oil she used in total. We divide eight by the number of times there is eight ounces. In the first time (6 times), there is eight ounced of oil and in the last batch (six times), there is one eight ounces (1 * 8 = 8). The total amount of ounces is 76. To make this into the metric system, we multiply the eight by 0.133 to get eight ounces, which is a little bit more than 6 ounces (8 x 0.6 = 4.8).\n\nWe can calculate Sonja's answer as follows: 16\n\nThe problem can be summarized below with the values from the math calculation.\n\n1. 8 * 0.6 =.76.\n2..76 * 6 = 4.56.\n3..456 * 100 = 45.6.", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "The answer is 64 pills. To simplify, we separate the different types of pills based on their name, starting with insulin because there are two of them. A week has 7 days, so in one week we need at most 14 insulin pills. To answer that, we start from the right, working left to right. Since insulin pills are 2 units each in a week, there must be 7 units in the entire week. This means we can get 7 units at most by using the smaller unit twice a week. Since there are two pills to consider total, there must be 3 \u00bd units in one week. Each of these rounds out to 3 units, making the insulin total 3 units by the end of the first round, so we get 6 units total in one week. At most 14 inslinin pills in a week means 13 insulin pills and 3 insulin pils in a week, which can be written as: 13 insulins and 3 insulins. \n\n**Since Holly needs 13 insulion pills, the number of injections she needs are 13 insulans.**\n\nRinse and repeat with the BP pills, which we know are 3 per day (3 units). We know we need 7 per week and that we're going for one less, so the number must be the same. Working backward, this means we must divide by 3 to get 7, which gives us 2. The amount of pills Holly takes in a week then is: 2 units of BP in the morning and 2 in the evening for 4 units per day x 7 days = 28 units per week, or 28 BP pills per week. The same applies when doing it for the anticonvulsants. We know we need twice the number of BP pills, so we divide by 4 to get 1/4, or 0.25, then multiply by 7, or 1.75. We multiply two of them together. This amounts to 32 units. This means that to get the units per week, we have to divide by 28 and multiply by 4. This yields 2.083 pills per day", "answer": " 77"}

{"text": "Lydia would be 16 years old when she gets to eat the first apple from her tree.\n\n### Analysis\n1. The apple tree grows an apple in 7 years.\n2. If Lydia was 4 years old when she planted the tree, and now she is 9 years old, then it has been 5 years since it was planted and 6 years since 4 was added to it (remembering the initial plantation).\n3. Together, this equates to 11 years since it was plant and it must grow an apple in those years before she can eat the apple.\n4. 11 - 7 = 4 years left until it can grow its first apple.\n5. She will be 13 (because Lydia is currently 9 and 4 more years is added to the plantation time of the tree), then she will be 14 the next year, she will be 15 the next year, she goes to 16 which is the age she will get to eat the apple.\n6. Therefore, she will be 2 years old when she first eats an apple from her tree. \n7. The math is: 7 years - 5 years = 2 years for plantation time left. 2 years (from when Lydia planted the tree) - 6 years when adding up her age between 4 and 9 = -4 years. Therefore, in one year, she will be able to eat an apple from the tree and then the time from when it was planted will be up, so she will start eating apples from what the tree will yield.\n\n### Example\n1.

Divide both amounts by the total amount needed to get how much money she has.\n\nThe solution is the following:\n\nMrs. Smith\u2019s total amount of money - $500\n\nThe total amount of dollars she needs: $500 x 0.15, or 15% off = $75\n\nSo in order to get the total amount needed, multiply by 1.15 to get the cost of that sale price after discount. In this case, the discount is $75 and so the total amount needed is $675.\n\n1. Multipe by $675 to get the total amount she needs\n2. Add the total amount she has to the total cost needed\n3.

This statement implies that 3 times as many voted for the unicron as for the witch. If we plug these two values into the equation, we get:\n\nThe statement doesn't tell us anything about the votes for the witch and dragon, but instead tells us:\n3x the number of votes for *unicorn cake* was casted, which can be interpreted as there were three times as many votes for unicorn as for witch cake.\nSimilarly, the statement mentions, \" the number of votes for dragon cake was *25* more than the number of *votes for the witch cakes\"*. Therefore, there were 25 more votes for dragon cakes than the votes for cakes. As we know, 3x (unicorn's votes) > than 25 more votes (dragon's votes). Now we substitute the 25 to 25+1 (subtract the ones from either sides to get an integer), and we get:\n\n 25 > 524 + x\n\nNow, because 25 > 3x, we can conclude that x < 25, so the number of votes must be greater than 25 > 0.\n\nNow the number of votes for 'the witch cake' and 'the dragon cake' together can be written as 25 + 0 < x < 25 + 25 = 50.\n\nTherefore, if 7 people voted for 'the witch' cake, the total number of votes must be between 6 and 50.\nTherefore, the minimum sum of all votes is 6, and there are 50 possible values that the total votes could be. Therefore the maximum value it could be is 50.

{"text": "The total number of ants found by Abe, Beth, CeCe and Duke is 61.\n\n### Explanation:\nTo solve this problem we can use the Law of Sets. Basically a set is a group of objects. When one person sees 6 ants and the other only sees 5, then Abe and Beth can only see the same number of ants. We can say Beth's set is equal to Abe's set. Likewise Duke's set is equal in size to CeCe's set. The sum of the sets are the same. So the total number of ants the four children see is equal to the total number of sets they see. The formula for solving this problem is (4(6)) + (50%) + (1)(2) + (2)(4) = 61.\n \n### How I did it\n* I first found the different ants Beth, CeCe, Abe and Duke saw. \n* I then worked out the total number of annexes found by Abe. This was 5 which is 4 ants less than what Beth saw. Therefore, Beth saw the same number of annexes as Abe. \n* Next I worked out the total number I could see if I combined Beth and Abe's sets. This totaled 6 which is the same amount as what Duke saw.\nDuke's set had two more annexes than what Cece saw. Cece's set had twice as many ants. Therefore, the total number of annets CeCe saw was equal to half what Duke saw.\n\n### Resources:\n1.

{"text": "John pays $21.25 for his medication.\n\n### Rationales:\n1.  To cover 40% of 2 pill a day cost, you need 40/30 = 1.33 pills each day.\n2.  One pill costs 1.5.  Therefore, to cover 1.33 pill each days' needs, John pays for 2 x 1.33 = 2.66 total pills.\n3.  If you calculate $1.5 x 2.66 = $4.09, this means that John has to pay 40% of $4.09 = 1.63 and John pays 2.66 - 1.63 = 1.03. \n4.  So, if you calculate 1.5 x 1.5 = 2.25, this means that John pays for the first day, 2.25 - 1.69 = 0.56 and the total amount paid in a 30 day month is $5.69 + 0.56 * 29 total days = $21.2 5\n\n### Response 2:\n$21.30 \n\n1. John pays $21 each day. \n2. However, John is on insurance, the insurance covers 4/10 of the medication cost. \n3. If you consider the daily medication cost to be $21, insurance only covers the price of 40/100 = 4/10 = 0.4 of the medication cost, then 0.4 *21 is 0.84 for insurance to cover. \n4. $21 - 0.84 is $18.50 for insurance to cover, with an additional $1 for John to pay for the convenience of pharmacy store's daily fee for medication. \n\n5. \nThus, he pays $18.56 in total each day.\n\n### Input :The store sells 418 mangoes.

{"text": "Answer the following grade science question.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdc The problem domain\n\nThe problem involves finding the minimum value of a function (the length of time to fill a tub) which is determined by the number of openings and closings of a water tap. This requires calculating how many openings/closings it takes for the tub to fill. The first value of the number of openings/closings is zero, since the tub is closed when there is no water flow, and is open when water is flowing out of the tap. Each additional value of the number of water openings corresponds to opening the tap and allowing it to fill before closing it, and the closing the tap and beginning the process of closing the tap again for the next opening. There are multiple ways to calculate the number of openings it takes to fill a tub by varying how many times you open and close the tap, but the simplest way is by using the sequence of numbers: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, where -1 is the previous closing, 0 is no opening or closing, 1 is 1 opening, 2 is 2 openings, and 3 is 3 openings. This sequence also represents the total number of times the tap must be opened and closed to fill the tub, where each number in the sequence corresponds to the number of times the tub must be filled with water.\n\n## \u2b06\ufe0f Level summary\n\nTo be able to answer this level, you must be able to:\n\n- **Answer** a math problem that incorporates the concept of multiplication.\n- **Answer** an informational text where you are asked to answer a grade question and identify which sentence provides a rational for your chosen answer.\n- **Answer the** grade math problem.\n\n## \u2714\ufe0f Solved Example\n\nCheck out the below solved example, where we walk you through the process of solving a grade math problem in GradeBook.\n\n### Solved Example:\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWrite the missing number in each equation below by following the _**rules below**_\n\n1.

{"text": "It costs $28. \n\nWe found the cost of food and the tax by first adding the food items together. $2(3+4)= 8 Pakoras and 3 Samosas added together equals $14. Then we added $2, which is the cost of the food, to $14 for a total of $16. Therefore, the combined cost of the food was $16. Next, we added a 25% tax, which would make the total cost $20. We added the 25% tax to the food, which was $10, and the result was $20. This is the final cost of the meal.\n\n### Rationale\n\nAnswering this question required several steps, starting with adding a few quantities together. We had to consider the cost of the food after we got the total cost of the food. The food in this question is an Indian meal that includes four orders of pakorras and three samosas. The total cost of the food includes the cost of the food itself and the total tax, so the last thing we had to do was add the tax to the two numbers we already had. \n\n### Discussion Response:\nMy suggestion of an additional task would have been to add another type of food item to the equation. A question like this shows two or more food items being bought so if the question stated something like \"Hilary bought twelve samosas at $1 each and two mango lassis at $3 each.

{"text": "The total amount changed is $8.60\n\n### Rationale for a choice:\nThe total is 20-x*(4)-y, where x is the number of cappuccinos and y is the number of espresso's.

We know x can only be 2,0,2,3,3,3 and if it was any greater, it would not be able to add up to $20.

So 0.25 * 16 = 4 because the numerator has more digits than the denominator.\n\nAnswer: How Many Babies Will We Have?  \n4 Babies!\n\n### Inputs:\n\n### Response\n\n### Rationales:\nBecause there are 2 mating pairs for each baby, if we multiply.3 x 2, we get 0.6, and then add 1 so we have a total of 1 baby per pair. So if the babies always exist, then there must be more than 1. So the answer is: 6. \n\n### Input\n\n\nA dog house contains 5 dogs.

There is no remainder, so if we were to divide by two (16/2) we would get an exact number\n3.  Adding James' half of the bill (which is $16) to James's friend's bill (which is $24), we get a total bill amount of $50.  But, we already know James' bill is $16.  Therefore (50 - 16), our bill total should be 34.\n4.  We don't know how to determine payment since there is a remainder and tips are not explicitly addressed in the question, so we can consider the bill to be $34, divide by $34 by two, and we get an amount of \"half\" of the bill, which is $28.75 (+ change if given).\n5.

{"text": "Since there are 15 classrooms total, 1/3 are 15, while 2/3 are 10. Because not all classrooms have 3 desks, the total number of students must be more than 10.\nTherefore, a total of 15 students can use a desk at each classroom. Given that 15 is a number that is divisible by 3, the school can accommodate a total of 45 students if everyone has their own desks. \n\n### Explanation:\nIn the given situation, there are 15 total classrooms and 10 total rooms where all desks already filled with students. In other words, if all students used the same desk, a half would be forced to not have their own desk. \n\nThe question states that all students have their own desks. Therefore, not all desks can be filled by students and some have to remain empty. \n\nTo determine a total number of students, the following equation can be written:\n16 = 15x + 10y, where x is the total number of students given 15 classrooms, and y is the number of students in rooms with 30 desks. If this equation has no solution, then the school is unable to fit all students into one room where every student has their own desk.\n\nIn the above situation, 16 can be expressed as a sum, 15 x (x/3) + 10, where (x/3) represents the total number of students in all rooms with 30 students. As the sum of this equation will result in 16, there is a solution.\n\nTherefore - 16 = 10x, 10x = 16 - 10, and x = 6. This means that a possible solution with at least 6 desks remaining is when x = (x/3) 3. \n\nHowever, it is not clear if the equation is balanced yet. To find whether or not the formula is balanced, y = x. Multiplying both sides by 3 -\n\n\\(16 = 16 - (x/3) \\cdot 10\\)\n\nSubtracting y from both sides -\n\\(10 = 10\\cdot", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "First, the question needs to be restated. If each puppy eats 3x more than each dog, that means that each puppy eats as much as 3 dogs. For simplicity, I will rename each puppy A, B, C, and D. Let's assume that A eats 3 pounds, B eats 2 pounds, C eats 1 pound, and D eats 2 pounds. Then, there were 4 puppies, and the three dogs (I will assume that there are fewer than 4 dogs) ate 12 pounds on total (6 dogs * 2 pounds). Therefore, we need to add on 4*3 for A and the 12 for the three dogs: (6+4)*2+12 totaling 28 pounds of food was eaten a day. \n\n### Delivery\nThe final total was 28 pounds of feed each day.\n\n### Input\nThere are 300 people in a train station.

Remember, I restated the previous question: There are 4 puppys... Let's just simplify this. I like to number items one through 300, and then label it as 300 people. The question states: 60% of the men wear red or blue. 60% is 180/300 = 1.25. 1.25 can be simplified to 3/4 = 0.75. Another way to do this if you don't know that you can subtract fractions, is if you subtract what is 1/2 from 2/2. This leaves a result of 3/6 (6/2-1/2) = 3/4.

{"text": "Since Joel\u2019s garden is half for fruit and half for vegetables, we can make these calculations based on the fact that 50% of his garden is fruit and 50% is vegetables. That being the case, Joel has 32 square feet of fruit section and 32 square feet in the vegetable section. Since he wants to use a quarter section for strawberrries, we\u2019ll cut a quarter of 32 square feet (equal to 8 square feet).\nNow that we know the number of square feet Joel has for strawberries, we can plug this amount into the first equation and calculate the total square feet of garden used by multiplying 8 square feet by 1/4. So we have 8 square feet times by a quarter (1/4) in 2 square feet. To solve this problem, the steps can be summarized as follows:\n-First, 50% of the garden is fruit, and since 50% is fruit, you have 32 square feet for fruit: 32 square feet times what number do we want to find out? The answer is a quarter of that number. 32 square feet divided by what amount do we want to find? The answer is 8 square feet.\n-Next, we know the garden is 1/2 fruit, then we know that we have 32 square foot for fruit and 32 square foot in the garden. Now we will take 1 quarter out of 32, which is 8 square feet since we have 32 divided by 8.\n-Fruit and vegetable together take up 64 square feet. We cut a portion of 8 square feet off of fruit, so the garden contains 56 square feet of fruit and vegetable together.\nNow we can plug in the 8 square feet cut off of the fruit section to the 64 square feet to solve for the total square feet of fruit and vegatables in the garden:\n56 square feet of fruit and vegetables is 8(8)2 in square feet, therefore 56 is 64.\n\n### Input\nA small town\u2019s school has 320 students. 42% of these students are female.

{"text": "1. This question asks: if Legoland has 5 koalas for each kangaroo, then how many koalas are there?\n2. First, we need to convert the numbers into a proper fraction. Since 5 is bigger than 180, we can convert each koala into 45 fractions.\n3. So we convert 5 koalas into 240 fractions. Next, we will replace the koala numbers with the fraction numbers.\n4. Therefore, we will replace 45 fractions with a 45/5 fraction, which is 9/3.  9/3 is our fraction to represent 45 koalas from the original 5 koalas.\n5. Next, we need to multiply our koala fraction by 5/180 to find the amount of koalas that is converted into fractions.\n6. By going through these steps, we find the answer: 240/3 kangaroos.\n7. So if Legoland has more than 3/180 of kangaroos, then it has 180+x, where (180 + x) / 3 are koalas.\n8.

This is equivalent to dividing the whole 24 \u00bc inch square pyramid into one 6 inch segments. The height is going to be half of the square pyramid. The volume of a square pyramid is 13 divided by the area which means 12.5. If the volume is divided by the 16, the answers that you get from going through the problem shows that the volume will be 8.33. So the volume becomes 8 when you divide by 2. You then have to take away 5 from the volume because 12 divided by 12.5 is 3/4 which is 0.75 and that is half. Then you will get volume of square pyramid is", "answer": " 3,888"}

If a person had five friends and decided to get drinks for them and drinks for themselves, if they want to eat that means they have to pay extra for food.\n2. It's important to notice that in this example James buys two rounds of drinks for his five friends and six drinks for himself.\n3. The price for each drink that James ordered is $6.\n4. James also pays for his own food.\n5. He is allowed to leave a 30% for everything which means he has to spend 100% * (30% = 0.30)\n6. Substitute each part to find the total equation is (0.30 * number of drinks * number of rounds * tip) + (1.4 * tip * food price * food round)\n7. If a customer pays the same amount for his six drinks, his five friends get two drinks each.\n8. 6 drinks + 2 drinks for each of his five friends = 9 drinks\n9. 6 drinks x 0.30% + 9 drinks x 00.30% = 6 * 0.3 + 9 * 0.3 = 3.6 + 2.7 = $6.30\n10. James decided to leave a 33%, which is a 00.33% tip on the total spend for the drinks including the drinks and the food which means he has to multiply the 003 * 003 = 0.009\n11. Therefore, the total amount he spent is $6.30 + $1.29 = $7.59 which means he spent $2.30 on food which comes to a grand total of $9.89.\n12.

{"text": "Fabric left in square feet:\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\nIn this task, Ann is cutting fabric to make the curtains. The question states that she cuts a 4 ft x 6 ft rectangle for the living room and a 2 ft x 4 ft rectangle for the bedroom, while the bolt of fabric has a size of 16 ft x 12 ft. We must calculate how much fabric Ann has left from the task at hand.\n\nWe already know Ann's choice of cutting fabric and its initial size. From these, we can easily derive the answer.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the area of the 4 ft x 4 ft fabric. According to the calculator, the area of `4 ft x 4ft` = `64 sq ft`\n\n$$16 ft x 64 sq ft \\ \\mathrm{area \\ of \\ 4 \\ ft \\ x \\ 4 \\ ft} \\ \\mathrm{=} \\ \\mathrm{1056 ft^2}$$\n \nSecond, we need to calculate how much of the bolt of fabric was used. According to the table, the area of `8 ft x 12` = `96 sq ft`.\n\nSince `8 ft x 4 ft = 32 sq ft`, `8ft x 4 ft` is actually the area of fabric left after the rectangle is cut. Therefore, the area of the remaining fabric is `96 - 32 = 64 sq ft`.\n\nTo answer the question, simply multiply the area of the remainder by `16 ft x 4 ft`. You'll get `64 sq ft x 16 ft x` = `10912 sq ft`.\n\nAnswer:10,912 sq ft", "answer": " 160"}

You get a yes, no, yes, yes sequence. What can the final coin be?\nRationales\n1. This question can be simplified to the following:  There are four coins in the box, one of which is silver, one is gold, one is copper and one other is black, and one is pulled.  Then you ask the rest of them if each of the coins are silver or copper, and in the given sequence, only gets a yes, no, no, yes. \n2. Thus, we know that at least one of the four coins is silver or gold.\n3. In the given sequence, two coins are positive, so we can eliminate either two other coins, which is black and the last coin.\n4. Among the three black coins, we can eliminate the first two because they're the only two gold coins, so one of them is silver.\n5. Based on the sequence, one of the the copper coins is silver.\n6. Therefore, one of the copper coins can only be gold, making it a 50% chance.\n7. The answer will be the last coin.\nAnswer: last coin.\n\n### Input\uff1a`(3)` is what type", "answer": " 75"}

This can be easily determined through finding the relative cost. With the cup of coffee costing 4 and the cup of milk costing 6, this would mean the relative cost is 4/6 = 2/3. The 32-ounce Coke price of 2 then represents a relative discount of 2/2/3, which means it would offer a savings of 2/3 times the price of the other beverages. Therefore, 2/3 x (6+8) = 24.

One approach would be to calculate a sum for the red and coconut jelly beans in three ways to find the desired answer. There are 5600 total jelly beans in the jar. 750 is one fourth of 5600. 750 jellies are coconut flavor. Red is 75% of the jelly beats.

While breakfast could be consumed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, brunch is more commonly thought of as a Saturday or Sunday activity.\n- This answer option is too vague. The question does not state the time of the day but it does specify week days, and it indicates that the food consumed is school lunch.

While a dessert could be consumed on other days or occasions, it is not likely to be consumed on school days or a typical work week.\n- This answer is correct on the basis of the question.

{"text": "Answer: C or D. \n\n### Rationale: \nTony started his 4.8 years of college (4+2 degrees) and got a graduate degree after that.  So it had been 6.8 years since he started in college, but he was still working as an astro- not yet having graduated.  So he continued working another 2 years, then he became an acro- and was done schooling.  Total 8.8 years, therefore his degrees were not the cause of it.\n\n### Challenge:\nThis question is more appropriate if the reader has a solid understanding of the mathematical concept of \"decimal to fraction\" and \"add more time together\".  In case it's not obvious from context, but it's likely not, these were Tony's degrees.  \nChallenge: Convert the decimal representation of Tony's total time in college (4.8) to a fraction.  For me, this is equivalent to writing the representation as 4 years, 8 months.  I get 24/10 from this, but of course any reasonable reading is permissible.  Now that we have this representation we can ask about the length of time between getting one degree and the other. We have 4 years between the two science degrees, 2 years between science and Physics, and 2 years between Physics and astronaut.  Can we add these together?  We can do this because the only factor is time, for all these scenarios we are converting from seconds into years.  So in total, Tony was in college for 6.8 years, then an additional 2 years on his graduate degree, which brings us to 8.8 years total.\nAnswer: C or E", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "In total, he devoted 3 hours to practicing the trumpet and 10 hours to playing basketball. Because practice sessions are doubled, his time for practice is effectively 3 times what he actually put in. If he practiced for double the amount of time that he played basketball each day, he devoted 4 times as much time as he did to practicing as to basketball. He ran for half the total time he spent on basketball, which in turn worked out to be half his entire time spent playing basketball. He spent 10 + 4 = 14 hours total on basketball.

We will treat Timothy's initial $50 as the given first.\n3. The choices are t-shirts, key chains, and bags.\n4. We will treat the shirts and bags as the given.\n5. As Timothy did not buy key chains, his total of money will go down by the $2 for every key chain.\n6. Therefore, he does not have enough money to buy key chains anymore, so we don't need to calculate about the key chains anymore.\n7. Therefore:\n- If he bought 2 key chains before buying shirts and bagn then the remaining money will be $40,\n- If he only bought 1 t-shirt and 1 bag then the remaining money will also be $40.\n- Therefore: As Timothy had $50 to begin with, the total he had was $40.\n8. Therefore, Timothy has enough money to buy 2 bags.\n9.

The even numbers can be ordered as: 2, 4, 6, 8, \\dots 2i  - the $2i$ is twice what the odd number is (e.g., $2i = 2*3 - 1 = 5$). This means that the first two sets add up to 9 * (sum$_{i = 1}^{2n- 1}$ the odd numbers).\n2.

As as a result, the cost of four pairs of shoes would be seven times that of the cost of 4 cannes of corn.\n### Rationales :\n1. The response should be an integer.\n2. When comparing the cost of the cans of corn to the cost of the shoes, the cost of the shoesshould be expressed in terms of shoe cost rather than the price of a can of corn.\n3.

So the whole pizza is divided into two equal parts. Lard then cut each half equally into pieces leaving a total of 8 slices in the whole pepperoni pizza. If 1 of those slices fell off of Lad's hand then we assume that the 1 cut off piece was a slice of the whole pizza that Lard was holding, and there would be 7 total slices on the slice Lard would give to Jelly. \n\n### Difficulty:\n* Beginner\n### Answer:\n![](images/answer.png)", "answer": " 9"}

It was asking Veronica and Velma what their shortest distance to where they were could be. Because the distance could be 2000, it could also be half of 2000.

The flashlights are placed next to each other, so the distance between Veronica's and Freddie's is the same as them, half of the second choice.\n\n### So the second distance is 4/3 of 2/3 of the second answer, which is 5/3, which would give you 3334 feet. If you were to subtract 4 times 27,027,02, then it would be about 11,000 feet.

The additional avocados are not necessary if Georgie is unable to use them in guacamole, and her original set of 5 avocado will also be able to fulfill her needs without adding other avocados. \nIn summary, Choice C presents the most efficient solution since Georgie can use the additional avocados with her sister's original set to create 13 more servings of guac. \nAnswer: C: 13servings of guacamoles\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following grade math question (15/20)\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: To get 525% in a recipe you are only adding two ingredients.

{"text": "Answer: The total number of pounds of sand collected by the three girls was 160 pounds.\n\n##### Rationale:\n\n1. Given the information mentioned in the question, an equation can be formed to express Eden's buckets as E = 4.\n2. An analogous equation can be used to represent Mary's buckets. In this case, Mary's number of buckets is denoted by M, and it is equal to M = 3 + E.\n3. The same logic can be applied to Iris, who has the number of buckets specified by I = 1 + M.\n4. Using the substitution M = 3 + 4 and I = 1 + 3, an equation for I can be formed to be equal to 4. Substituting the values into the equation, we arrive at I = 4, which gives us an I = 4 solution.\n5. The given information regarding the number of buckets of sand can then be organized as follows: E = 4, M = 3 + I = 4, and I = 1.\n6. Using these values together with the values for E and M, we can now organize the information as follows: 4 = 3 (E + I). 3 + I = E.\n7. To find the number of pounds of sand for each individual girl, we can solve their equations for E and M:\n  * 4 = 3E + 4\n  * 3 + I =E\n8. Applying the substitution E = 4, we have 4 = 3(4) + 4, which can be simplified using the distributive property. This gives us E = 4 = 12. From the last equation, I = 4, E = 12 can be solved for E, resulting in E = 4 = E = 12. This gives us our answer of 4 = 160.\n\n### Input\n\n> **Pizza parlor -** 1 Pizzaria = 566 Pizzas + 11,100 Serviings\n>\n> **Gym -** 1 Gym = 2,275 Exercising athletes + 745 Exercising students \n>\n> **Supermarket -**", "answer": " 34"}

{"text": "The total number of people at Ashley's birthday party, including Ashley, is 260. This calculation requires some knowledge of proportions and division. The question mentions that each of Ashley's guests had one more person come, for a total of 40. Next, it states that the total amount of guests that Ashley invited was 20. Therefore, if each of the guests had one person come with them, those people would have made up 20 of the 40 guests. This leaves 20 guests, leaving 20 people left for Ashley to invite. \n\nIn the problem, each guest brings one person each, totaling 20 new guests. The question states that half the amount would then come with their guests. If there were 20 new guests, this would mean 10 would come with a guest each, bringing the total amount of guests to 40 each time. This would create a total of 200 guests. Finally, the question states that Ashley is included among the 200, but it does not state how many guests did not attend. To find that number, it was necessary to include Ashley's number in the total so every guest would appear in the answer as well. This created a total of 260 guests, including the birthday girl, Ashley.\n\n### Input::\nAshley had a party and invited 260 friends. Each person brought one friend and half of them brought two. The other half did not bring anybody, but Ashley came. What is the final number of guests at her party?\n\n### Solution:\n\nFinal number of guests is 512 \n\nFrom each individual person, that person brought 260. 260 is evenly divided by 2, so each guest brought one friend.\n\nLet's take it further to half way. So, from 260, we divide it by 2 - The answer is 130.\n\nIt says half of the amount brought 2 friends. So from the 130, we divided it by 2 - the answer is 65.\n\nIt says the other half brought no one. So 65 - 65 = 0. So, now if you added the two, you get 130 and the other", "answer": " 31"}

This means that Bobbie took two letters of her last name away.\n3. Samantha\u2019\u2019s last name has an additional two letters than Bobbie\u2019\u2019s but Bobbie only took two away.\n4. Jamie\u2019s last name is only three letters long which is half the length of Bobbie\u2019s name so Bobbie had to take four letters off.\n5. This means Bobbie started with a name of 25 letters (5 of which were vowels since her first name is Jamie).\n6. Samantha has 6 extra letters in her name.\n7.

This question is asking how often a moon eclipse occurs. \n2. Based on the question's wording, the best way to solve the question is to find out how long, on average, it takes for an eclipse to happen.\n3. Let's find this out by dividing 18 years by 31, which is 0.5833.\n4. Multiply by 100 to convert to a percent and it becomes 58.33% \n5. Thus, the moon eclipse occurs on average 58.3% the time.\n6.

{"text": "Answer. The amount of salt needed on the desert island is 40g when the water evaporates.\n\n### Process\n\n1. If the water is made up of 20% salt and 80% water, then 2 liters is water of which 1.6 liters is water and 0.4 liters is salt.\n2. Because only 80%, or 1.6 litres, evaporates, the salt left is 0.5 litres.\n3. Because 20% is salt and 80 is water, then: \n0.5 = 0.2 * 2 is equal to 0.5.\n0.5 x 0.2 = 0.01.\n0.01 ml is equivalent to gram of salt.\n4.

However, this seems very tedious. So there is a better way that we can solve it (and we can apply all such methods that are provided in the book)\n\nStep by Step: \n\n1. Since it is 4 months, we can divide 4 by 3 since we already know the number of chores that Gerald wants to do.\nSo after dividing, it becomes 1 3/3 or 1 whole. \nThis means Gerald needs to do (1 x 4) or 4 more chores a month.\n2. The book states \"40 minutes per chore\".\nTherefore, in each month, Gerald is working approximately for one hour or 60 minutes.\nThe given number is the number of hours he wants to work per chore.\nAfter calculating, Gerald wants to work for approximately 10 more hours (in total).\n3. Gerald wants to make 10 more dollars in order to buy the monthly supplies.

{"text": "On Tuesday, the maximum number of full length movies Grandpa could've watched is 10.\nOn Wednesday, the maximum number possible is the total number of movies + 0, or 20.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. On Tuesday, Grandpa watched four 90-minutes movies which would've taken 4 hours.\n2. On Wednesday, Grandma watched twice the number of movies on Tuesday.\n3. To find the maximum, the sum of the number on Tuesday and the number of Wednesday must be less than 24, which is the number of hours in a day.\n4.

{"text": "5  Square feet\n\n### Rationale:  The math question requires 5 square feet of wrapping paper.\n\n### Input and Rationale: \n\n#### Input:\n\nCarrie is wrapping three presents. One present needs twice as much wrapping paper as the second present. The third present needs twice as much as the second present and has the same amount as the two presents put together.\n\n#### Rationale:\n\nSince each present needs double the amount of present than the previous present, it is likely that the amount is doubled by two. \n\nThe given information states that each present needs twice as much paper as the preceding present. The numbers can be simplified to say: 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, 5 square feet is the correct answer because it requires 2 times two, which is equivalent to 4 square feet, plus an entire second layer on top of that 4 square feet, which is equivalent to an extra 4 square feet, making it a total of 5 square feet in all.\n\n### Submit your own question\n\n[Write a Task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/118LrDJf2q7p56o0Eu75Ww-9bXDG2B487/view?usp=sharing)", "answer": " 7"}

This statement will have all of the relevant information to be used in this equation.  In the question it asks for us to determine the amount left.  We can then plug in the given variables to reach this value.  First notice that the girls want to go the pool with 10 people. Next the cost to go the pool is $2.50. For a total of this, we must calculate 2.50x10 this is the same as $25 so our amount left now equals $30+25 dollars.  The final step is to subtract this value from the given 30 dollars to reach the final answer of $2.35.\n\n\n### Tests:\n1. Input: What does a pump do if it is not operating?

Now the second sentence will say \u201cKen gave ten pencils... \u201d in the end it say \u201che kept the rest of the pens\u201d. So Ken got some pencils that were equal to his or less then his ( fifty) then he gave ten pencils. Now let\u2019s start by counting how many pencils he gave to Manny  ten plus ten and ten, it will make one (10) pencils. The last sentence in the question. it say \u201che kept....the rest of the pencil\u201d. So he had ( fifty minus ten) fourty (40) pencils then after he gave the ten pencils, he still had (forty less than ten) \u201c he kept  six (6) pencils\u201d. Now to choose the correct answer we need to look at the last number that he gave then to keep that number you have to multiply it by the value that was left (he had 40 pencils and 10 he gave them). and he kept 12 pence (6 X 2).\nAnswer: 6\u00d72=12 pencils\n\n### Input; It is 3pm as I am writing this.

{"text": "### A. 87\n\n### B. 70\n\n### C. 194\n\n### D. 92\n\n### E. 13\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, Haruto has 127 tomatos in total, including those that were eaten. When he picks half of his tomatoes, 63.5 tomatos are picked. Haruto then shares half of his tomanos with his friend. This means Haruto no longer has 63.5. However, these tomatos are half of the total tomatos so subtracting them from the original total would not be the right way to solve this problem. Instead, if half of Haruto's tomatos are picked and he then gives half his tomatos to his friend, then Haruto's tomato count would go from 127 to 63.5, plus the other 38.5 tomatos that were not picked or given away. This gives us a total of 102 tomatos, which is 100 + 2, so we divide 100 into 2, which is 50, so we get 50 tomatos for Haruto. Now Haruto gives 50 tomatos to his friend which leaves him with 50 + 50, which is 192 tomatos left.\n\n### Below is an instruction that explains a task.\n\n### The problem could be formatted like this:Haruto has tomatops in his Backyard.

{"text": "We can figure out the numbers by dividing the total cost of 200 lottery tickets by the total winnings of 13.8. This gives us a total of 8.08, but no unit of measure is included so we have to find what is in the 8.08 by looking at the different amounts the winnings won.\n\nLet x = the amount that James won. We can use this formula to figure out the amount he won. To solve this formula, we have a total winners ($13.8) and subtract from total amount James spent. This can be found by dividing 200 lotteries tickets by the 100 lottery ticket price. Then you can solve the fraction.\n\n80% (9/10) of the winners is $13.8\n 80% $13.8 = 11.52 \n 11.50 $100 = 10/10 \n10/10 (8/10) of lottery tickets is 8/10 x 200 = 160/10  $16.00\n\nSo at the end James won 13.8 + 16.0 = $30. After the percentage of the winners is added up of 80% ($13.8), you need to subtract the percentage of losers which is 20% ($4). This gives you 10/14 = $1.43.

In a bag this size, there is no way that the bag will not fall as gravity has no other support. Gravity is stronger when something is raised higher (tallest) above the ground.\n\nIn the case of the bag, it is at it's highest point on the ground. It's lowest point is the floor. Therefore, gravity is strongest when it falls.\n\n### Response\n\n\n* The question asks if there is a way to do it, and it tells the person that gravity will fall no matter what. Since you can't avoid gravity falling, the only way to not fall is if the bags is empty.\n\n* \n\n### Input \nAnother solution to the bag problem is to attach a handle to it so that you can hold the bag and hold it up in one hand.

We should not carry the bag higher or lower than 2 feet from the ground, as that would put the bag within a point from the ground. In order to lift the groceries, you will need a bag that doesn't require moving the bag further than 2 feet.

The number of apples bought is: 30 for each man, 20 for each woman, totaling 120 apples.\n3. Two more of the same number of apples must be added to equal the total amount bought, which is 120 appes.\n4. Next we must subtract total number of apples from 120 to answer: 30 - 30 = 0 = 2 apples for each man, and 20 - 20 = 0 for each woman, and 1 apple is total amount of extra apples.\n5.

{"text": "The bear feasts on berry and small woodland animals during the summer. Feasting on berries and small animals makes up 1/5 of the required weight. The bear's autumn gains are 2 times larger than the summer feasting on berries. The bear's total gains from summer and autumn account for 900 pounds, which leaves 100 pounds to gain during winter by eating salmon.\n### Response: \nWe know that the bear needs to gain 1,000 pounds. Summer feasting accounted for 1/5 of it, meaning 100 pounds. We know that autumn was the bear's second opportunity to pack on more pounds. During autumn, the bear gained twice the amount needed to pack on this extra 100 pounds from summer. In order to gain 2 times the amount needed, the bear ate 200 pounds of berries and wildlife. This means the remaining 100 pounds are from eating salmon and will be gained during winter. Finally, total gains accounted for a total of 900 pounds before winter. This means that during winter, the bear only needs to gain 150 pounds to be completely ready for hibernate. Therefore, the total pounds gained will be:\n\n1. Feasting on Berries: 10 pounds\n2. Feasting on Wildlife: 200 pounds\n3. Feasting on Fish: 150 pounds\n\nPounds Gained: 1,250 pounds\n\n### Example: The bear in the previous example needed to gain 10 pounds while feasting on berry during the summer. It ate 20 pounds during autumn and 20 pounds during winter. The bear had a gain of 40 pounds from the autumn and winter.\n### Rationales:\n1. We know in advance that 170 pounds were gained from three activities (feasting on berries, feasting on wildlife, and feasting on fish).\n2. The bear only had to gain 10 more pounds while feasting berries during summer. The gain from berries was the equivalent of 10 pounds.", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "The question is asking you to use a riddle to determine how old Anne might be. \nTo solve the riddle, you must first understand the concept of \"times as old.\" \nThis means dividing or multiplying a number by the number of times that specific number is applied to another number. \nThus, when you divide a number by 2, the answer is 1; 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, 10 divided by 2 is five, 30 divided by 2 must be 15, etc. \nThis process of determining how old Anne is simply requires you to apply this concept and multiply two numbers together. \n\nThe question asks that you find the number of times Emile is Anne's age, then the number of times Maude is Anne's age. \nOnce you apply this information to the problem, you can create an equation to determine how old Anne must be. \n\nThe first piece of information states that Anne is twice as old as Emile. \nTo create the equation, simply divide 2 by Emile: 5 divided by Emile equals two. \nThis means that Emile will be 3 years old, and Anne was 2 when Emile was 1. \n\nThe second piece of information states: \"When Maude is six times as old as Emille, Emille will be six times as Old as Maude.\" \nWhen applying this to the problem, note that the previous piece of information tells you that Emile will be three years old, while Maude is eight years old. \nThe equation given now reads \"Maude is six times as Old as Emile; Emile will be six years as Old as Maude,\" and that means Maude is 36 twice as old as Emille. \nThis means you must find out how old Maude is and multiply the result by 36 to determine how old Emille will be when they're both six times as old as each other. \nThe question doesn't specify how old Maude is, so you must make a calculated guess. \nIn this case, it seems like Maude is 40 years old, as in the example it's stated that \"when she is 24 years old, he would be 22.\" \nNow you can use the equation of Maude being 3", "answer": " 96"}

{"text": "As illustrated in the figure below, if Barry wants to reach apples that are \"5 feet high\", assuming the distance from the ground to Barry's shoulders is equal to \"f\", and the distance between Larry's shoulder and Barry's shoulders is \"d\", Barry can reach the apples by standing on Larry's shoulders. The total height is obtained by adding the distance of d, where d = (f/1.2)^2.  The resultant height is 12.979 ft.\n\n### Rationales: \n1. The sentence \"Larry and Barry want...\" indicates that there are two main characters involved in the story. Barry is able to reach apples that \"5 feet high\", which implies that he is 5 ft. tall.  \n2. Since Barry is 5 ft. and his shoulder height is 1.2*5 ft. = 6 ft. = 72 inches [in], the distance of \"d\" will be (f/1.7)*2 = 1.28*72, or 92.2 inches [in].  \n3. By taking the square root of this, f=(92.2)/1.2 = 7.79 feet. Since the sum of f and d will be the required height of 5 ft., the distance = f+d = 7.7+92.2 = 99.999999 ft. in the story.\n\n### Input:\"C\" says that he knows of a place where you can find a red dog and a yellow cat.

During the first hour, Bob created 13/60 of questions in all. As he doubled his rate in the second hour, he should have been able to create 26 new questions, which means he should have created 43 questions in total in the first two hours.\n3. In the third hour, he doubled his rate again to double his new rate in the second hour. This means that he has already doubled the new rate from the second hour.\n4. Then he created another set of 26 questions. It means the total number of questions for the third hour should be 49 questions.\n5. Bob has a total of 13+49=62 total questions.\n6.

It also states that the tubs are split up into 3 large tubs and 6 small tubs. It also states that it cost $48 for everything. And the final statement is that the large tubs cost$6. Now when you put that together you can tell that there are 3 large and 6 small tub in this problem. Now if we know that there were 48 tubs and the large tubs cost 6 dollars, how much do the smaller tubs cost? To find the answer you know you need to use a little bit of logic to figure out the cost of the smaller tubs. But don't worry because I'll guide you step by step along the way. When you know the information of this problem you'll be able to solve anything in math. Now first, look at the total price, \"48\" and see the difference between the number of the total price and the number of the value, \"$6.\" Therefore, \"$42.$ Now divide the numbers by \"$49.\" and when you do that you'll get two answers. One is $1 and the other is $.04 (40 cents) because. $.40 divided by $49 equals exactly $1 divided by $48. And that is exactly how much the smaller tubs cost. To find the answer you need to know how to figure out how many dollars are divisible by $48, you need to know division.

In this case, we can substitute 2 VIP tickes and 3 regular tikces for $, $ and $, and the number of VIP ticketes sold for $500\nwhich gives us $250$ VIP and regular tickets ( 2 x $100$ + $3 x $50 $)=$250$.\n\n### Rationales:\nIn the question, Mrs. Wilsborough saved 500 dollars to buy concert tickets. She bought 2 of the 500 and three more regular tickets for 500 each. How much she bought the whole concert tickets after the concert?\nTo answer this question, first, we need to identify the variable, or what the question is looking for. This is in the form: \"What x? x plus 4 equals\". The variable of \"500\" is written 500+4=1900. So Mrs Wilsborough buying concert tickets = X+4=19.000. Then, how many concert tickets did Mrs Wilsborough bought? According to our problem, there are 2 of 500 and 3 of 500. We have 2 X of 500+2 times 500 = 1000+1000=2000.

You must first decide how many were outside and use the percentage you obtained to estimate the number of English books in the library.\n**Response** We must decide how to use this information to obtain the number of outside books. 60% from outside means we need to calculate what percentage of total books fall outside of the US. This can be calculated by taking the total number of books and multiplying it by 60%.  There are 230 book so that 230% is 150 books. There are more books in english than outside of english, meaning the 150 is the same percentage of all books, not only those in english, which means that we can assume almost half of all english books are published outside the country, which is about 48%.\n**Rationales**\n### Demon:\n### Respond:\n### Rationale\n\n### Input\n### Reponse\n### Rationale", "answer": " 736"}

{"text": "The answer is 8 because this question is asking how many tomatoes are remaining after Andy has harvested from 18 plants. In order to determine the amount of tomatoes Andy has harvested, we first need to know how many plants he has altogether and how many tomatoes are present on each plant. This can be done by subtracting the number of tomatoes Andy turned into marinara sauces (3 out of 18) from the total number of tomatoes harvested (18). This calculation gives us a total of 15 tomatoes, meaning that Andy has harvested 15 tomatoes from all 18 plants combined. To determine how many tomatoes are being stored for next year, we first have to subtract out those 8 tomatoes Andy dried and half of the remaining 11 (2.5) tomatoes left over after Andy harvested them (15). This leaves us with a final number of 3.5 tomatoes remaining for next year. Therefore, the answer to the question is 8 because that is the total number of tomato that Anderson has harvested from all 18 of his plants combined and then divided by the number of plants harvested (15 divided by 18).\n\n### Output: The answer is 3 because the question states to multiply the number of tomatoes left over for next year (3) by 7. That is the number of plants (or tomato farms) multiplied by the number of tomatoes it produces (7). Since Andy has planted 18 farms, he will multiply his resulting number of tomatoes left for next year (3 x 18 = 54) by 7 for a final total of 363 tomatoes or rounded up another number that means three hundred and six (306).\n\n### Context: The question describes how many tomatoes are used to harvest 18 plants. This may be in reference to any scenario of a farmer growing his or her own tomatoes, from seed to consumption. It doesn't have to be Andy specifically and could even be someone else or an example. For example:\nIf you need to know how many tomatoes are growing on a particular tomato farm, then just count how many tomatoes grow on eight separate crops (18 in total) and then multiply that number by seven (7).

{"text": "In this problem statement, we can tell the number of seagulls is changing (the bird population is growing and shrinking) and the birds can move from one place to another.\n\n### Difficulties\n\nThe number and type of birds are changing. Therefore, in the solution, the question asks how many seagulls _remain_ at the end, indicating that it is necessary to track the number from the beginning (which the solution does).\n\nThe question includes the concept of multiple ways to get to the same location, and that multiple birds can share the same type.\n\nThe birds can move from one lot to another, and it is unclear if they can move within the same lot, but they can share the lot as well (for example, if they're near each other).\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe question is about the changeable bird population, but a fixed population that remains constant throughout the change does not match the given problem.\n\nThe following solution tracks the change in population throughout:\n\n#### Step 1\n\nThe beginning population is 36 birds.\n\n#### Step 2\n\nAfter 1/4 of the birds leave, the remaining population is 25 birds.\n\n#### Total\n\nAfter the 1/4 reduction of birds, there are _25 remaining_ (this includes birds that were already present).\n\n11/24 of the remaining birds leave the parking lot.

{"text": "Input:Five stores and one restaurant are involved in the project. The project is a $3,000 for the addition of 7 trash cans. The program will not run if the project is not $3,00\n\nThe total amount paid for adding trash cans is $7,300.\n\n### Explanation:\nIn order to calculate the total number of trash cans paid for, we must first add the cost of each added trash can for five shops.\nIf the town pays for adding trash can to each shop, then this means they paid for a total of $600 (5 X $120).\n\nIf the town is paid for adding trash to the back of each shop, then this would mean they paid $1,200 (2 X $600).\n\nTherefore, when combined, the total cost for added trash cans to each shop is $1,800 ($600 + 1,200).\n\nNext, we must find the cost of trash cans added to the one restaurant. The question states that the town will not run the project if it does not exceed $3,00. So far, we know the cost of trash added to each shop, which is $1,821 ($1,800 + $21). Now, we must find the added trash cans paid by the restaurant. The restaurant is a food business in which there is a kitchen. Therefore, the kitchen would probably require more trash cans than the other shops, so let's assume for the sake of this problem that we are adding ten trash cans to this restaurant. Now we need to find the total cost of 21 trash cans at $1,246 ($2 X $1,223).\n\nThe final total cost for paid trash cans is then $3,006, which is less than the budget. However, the project does not run, so we assume that the project is being put on hold because the price is slightly under budget.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe total cost of each shop to be added can be found by the equation cost of adding trash = $600.\n\nLikewise, for the food shop, we find total cost by equation total cost", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "In this question, Alex is making a calculation on how many dresses he can make out of 600 meters.\n\nI. The total sum of all meters of fabric given to 5 friends is 20 meters per person and the remaining 400 meters of fabric is used up by making dresses. \nII. If the silk is used by 1 person, multiply 5 meters x 1 person: Total of 5 meters and you have 400 meters left. Repeat this process for 1 person making 2 silk dresses. Now multiply 20-5 and you have 95 metres left. To find the solution we will apply the scientific method.\n\nIII. First, we make an assumption and set a boundary in a range, in this case an amount of meters of fabric we can buy, so 600-600=0. Therefore, there is no limit of the amount of silk we have bought.\n\nIV. Then we choose an interval. We chose the interval [0, 200] and choose a range of the domain of the set is the real numbers. Thus, in intervals of [0, 210-200] we chose, which is 10 metres\n\nV. By applying the previous steps, we can now plug and chug the problem and obtain the answer which is 37 dresses. 20 people were given 10m of fabric and one dress could be made with 10m thus we multiply all the 20 people and in turn their 10 metres and add the solution 20 x 210= 4200m.The last 500m was given to 1 person for 2 dresses and it was 500/2=250m and is added to the solution. Thus, the sum is 37m+4200m+250m = 4850m then divided with the total meters of fabric and we have 600m and so the answer is 4850/600= 8 miles of silk.Therefore, there are 37 dresses that Alec can make out of 20m each. \n\n### Feedback:\n\nSuggestions: 1.

Then from level 5 and moving to level 7 where it stops and rotating around so it stops at level 3. Then the Cutters moves to another position to complete the job the Cutters was made to do. How many time will this machine move to this position at the same level?\n\n### Rationales:\nThe machine would be able to make piece quickly using both cutters. With each level being one inch high, it takes the first part to complete the entire job in under 95 inches. Therefore, the first cutter does not complete the entire job under one inch high. However, we are shown the amount of inches the first cutter moves, and can apply the following equation:\n\nIn the process of cutting, it will move the entire length of one time + remainder of one inch, so moving from a length of 93 to a length of 87, the first cutter completes the job", "answer": " 140"}

Let T = the time it takes for 1/5 of all balloons to blow up, which is about half an hour or 30 min.\n\nThe first hour after T, approximately half the balloons have blown up so N is about 2/3 of the remaining balloons N approx. = 150 \n\n2 hours after T = 30 more of the balloons will blow up, twice the amount of the previous hour. So N now = 150 + 30 = 180. \n\n3 hours after T there will be still 100 balloons which have not blown up. \n\nSince each hour after the half hour it will take twice as long for the remainder balloons to inflate, meaning it will take approximately 60 more minutes. There will 300 minutes total. The baloons that were able to inflate at the 30 minute T, took 60/30 = 2 min. each. Now to figure out the remainder, 2:30 minutes for each. \n\nSo total time = 300 = Number of balloon that blow up. Each time takes 2 minutes to blow up each. So N = 198. \n\n### Solution:\nLet the Total Number of the balloons  = x\nAfter 0.5 Hours (30 minutes), 1/2*(x) balloons busted\nThen, Number of Remaining Balloons after 0.5 hours = x - 1/2*( x) = x/2\nAfter 1 Hour = (1 + 1/2) hours, the number of remaining balloons doubled. Therefore Number of remaining balloons after 1 hour = 2*(x/2)\nSo, number of remaining balloon after 1 hour = (x/2)*2 = x/4\nFinally, After 2 hours, Number of remaining balloon =", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": "The correct number of boxes Eugene needed is 3, each with 150 toothpikes. \nThe first method to solve the question is the formula 52 * 75 = 16 * 450.  You add the values, 16 * 75 + 52*450 = 3960.  If you divide 3960 by 150, you\u2019ll see one box has 3960 divided by 150 = 2,640.  Each box holds 2,642 toothpicks.\n\n### Or you could solve this problem using substitution and division.\nYou could work your solution in two ways.  Eugene needs to take the 16 cards that he didn't use out of his 450 to start the equation.  Divide 16 by 450, then multiply the result (9) by the number of toothpicks in the same card, which is 24.  9 * 24 = 216, which Eugene needs to take 9 out of 16 cards.  Then again, divide 450 by 15, then multiply the result with 16 because Eugene used 15 in the same amount (450/15) * 16=333 because you took 16 out with the same toothpicks divided by 15\n\nInput: After losing their money a group of people are at the  marketplace.

{"text": "There are \\(2{Caleb \\cdot Cynthia \\over 105}\\) trips.\nRationales:The first part of the problem states that both Caleb and Cyntia are filling up their Inflatable Pool. They fill their buks at the spigot (S) and carry them to the Inflatable Pool (P). The spigot can hold 12 gallons. As they fill up their Inflatable POOL, each bucket contains \\(3{12 \\over 7} = 1.75\\) gallons. So, each bucket can hold \\(3 \\cdot 1.75 = 5.25\\) gallons. Both Caleb and Cintia can add 8 and 7 gallons in each trip respectively. Hence, there are \\(2{17.5 \\over 18.25} = {\\frac {17.5}{18.25}} = 0.942 = 0.95\\) trips.

But then again, Tailor Shops do not always have to cut the fabric, sometimes they just have to sew (as a sealer if you will) the fabric together or repair it if it's been ripped or damaged. So maybe this is why the question is asking for a \"reading magazines\", it seems that the question is more focused on the person doing the sewing as oppose to that of a sealer.

None of the above is correct\n\nOutput: E: None of the above is possible\n\n\n\n### Instruction:\n\nFor this question, write a Python function to calculate which answer is closest to the given number. To do this, you'll need two more lines of code that will be given to you. One is a function that takes an integer as its argument and returns its square:\n\n```\ndef square(num):\n    # Input: num: Any int\n    # Return: An int that is the result of num * num\n```\n\nAs for the second function, here's a sample use of it on a number:\n\n```\nsquare(num)\n```\n\nFor example, if the original input were 37, then the following would be returned:\n\n```\n990\n```\n\nThe output will be used as your function's return value, either in an equal or greater-than comparison. In other words, if 990 is more than whatever it's comparing to but below 1000, then the output will be None. For instance:\n\n```\nif square(num) <= 1000:\n    return None\nelse:\n    return num\n```\n\n\n\n## Solution and Explanation\n\nFirst, we are going to code function that calculate the square of a number. (This is actually easy since we will just call the square() function that is provided to us.)\n\n```\nfrom math import pow\n\ndef square(num)\n    return pow(num, 2)\n```\n\n\n**Now that out function is done, let's test if it works**\n\nFor the test part, we will create a", "answer": " 25"}

{"idx": 690, "text": "E: $28.63\n\n---\n\n## Solution\nIn this task I need to build a bot which will give me an answer. I will ask series of question. If my question is grade the bot needs to say \"grade\". If it isnt, I need the bot to say \"that isnt grade math question\".\n\nThe first step I'm doing is to take all the questions I have and put them to a table. Then I have to loop over this table as many as I need and put them into the conversation between the bot and user.\n\nThis is the code I use to call questions from the table:\n```\n    getAnswersFromQuestionTable(answers) {\n\n      let table = {\n        \"curtains\": \"B\",\n        \"vegetables\": \"A\",\n        \"doctor\": \"C\",\n        \"train\": \"D\",\n        \"restaurant\": \"E\"\n      }\n      \n      return Array.from(table.keys()).map(k => {\n         return {\n           type_question: k,\n           answer: answer.replace('_type_question','')\n         }\n      });\n\n    }\n```\nAnd after that I put each item into the conversation:\n```\n    setAskingQuestion(answers) { \n      if (answers.length > 0) {\n          app.userMessagingInput = getAnswersFromQuestions(answers);\n          return `Ok, lets ask question: ${app.userMessagingInput[0].question}`;\n        }\n    }\n\n```\n\nAfter some testing it appears that the bot is answering my grade math questions correct.\n\nSo far the task seems to be easily solvable with a few lines of code", "answer": " 18"}

If they seem too easy for you or otherwise it seems too easy, then don't answer those questions unless you want to practice on a harder puzzle.\n### Solution\n\nI came to the math puzzle by taking a look at the first question of the puzzle. I decided to try to solve it using the brute force approach. I did this by trying every possible value for s and trying to see if those values matched with the answers above. In this way, I saw the correct answer was A. I then came to the next question. I chose the first answer choice and chose to try again. This process worked until the last question.\n\nNow, I looked at this and knew that I wanted to write a more efficient computer program to solve these problems.\n\nFor the program, I created a list to use. For the first question, it should be a list of choices with all the possible s's and the corresponding answer at the bottom of the list. We'll call the list, A. For the second question, let's call the list B. For the third, it will be C. And so on and so forth.\n\nFor loop\n\nThe first line of the code loops through all possible values of the s in every question. This allows us to make sure if the correct answer was given.\n\nNext, I made sure that the first answer was correct, so I gave the user to enter in the answer for s. Then, in line one of the next function, I made the statement that s is A because A is the first.\n\nThen, for line 6 and on, I'm going to create all possible answers for the question. To do this, I took the list of answers given for the question and for s and multiplied the list that was given for s by the list of answers given.\n\nThen, I printed out all the possible combinations and if the answer given did not equal the answers I printed, I printed it out", "answer": " 300"}

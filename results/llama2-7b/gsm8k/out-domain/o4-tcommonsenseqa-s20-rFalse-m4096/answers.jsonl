However, as you grow in your career, you start to find that not all simple questions can be answered in the same way. If you were programming a software application, how would you program a computer to answer questions? Answer them by writing the Python code to analyze grade math questions and respond to them. For example, if one question is \"What is my favorite food?\u201d and \"My favorite food is spicy food\u201d, how then would you make a program to analyze these two sentences and then respond with your favorite food?\n\n### You should be able to read the problem and write Python code to answer it to understand what grade math questions your program can understand and answer.

This is because the code was complicated because the first node in the queue is set to the 1st element, and it's the job of the queue to check if the elements of this node's neighbours are set to each index of the array. And if that's the number is then a boolean is set which will then change the colour of the array, and the endpoints of the queue that are set to have been processed. I've been coding the for the first time now and so there've been some bugs, but there's still some logic and algorithms not written yet. And I will try my best to write it next week. I think that it was a good week and I was able to finish some logic and algorithms. I just need to try and focus on getting better at the coding as I've only just begun this year and so I need to get used to it and practise.", "answer": " 20"}

The probability of both events happening is found by p = 2P(A) - P(A B). If we have P(A) = 0.7 and P(B) = 0.8 but P(A \u2229B) = 0, then:  p(A) = 1 - P(A \u00ac B) = 0.4 and p(B) = 1- P(A \u00acB) = 0\n\n### Instant:Answer the following grade 6 math question\n\nYou want to buy a game with 20% chance that every person at a party playing the game will like it and 80% chance people playing the game will like the game.

To do so, 2 students are in restroom means there are 14 students remaining in the classroom. We can assume the restroom was used. Therefore, c can directly be deduced by counting the number of c in the set.\nwe would want the number of students in the classroom to be at least 6. Therefore we have the value of d.\nIn the above instruction, the output will be the student count. we want the minimum student count to complete the sum.\ntherefore we should check the number of student in the class.\nWe should have 2/3 in every row.\nwe know every row should have 6 student. Thus it has 12 student.\nTherefore we need to assume that the value of a is 12. Hence the number of rows is 4.\nwe could add the values and find a + 6 + 6 + a or\nwe could add the value and divide by 3:\n(12 +4 + 4 + 12)/3 will give us 12.\nThus the total value is 24", "answer": " 23"}

The goal of this project is to implement a simple natural language program. You may use any programming language as desired. \n\nThe natural language programming system will consist of the following subsystems\n1. Pre-process stage of the program\n2. The natural language parsing and execution module (for the main program)\n3. A database\n4. An interface module to the database\n\nYou must document the natural language syntax, the programming syntax, source code, \na user guide, a documentation manual, report, any other ancillary files and make it available when the submission is due. \n\nThe programming language is free for your choice. \n\nThe group project must be implemented for one or all of the following four language/parsers:\n1. ACL2\n2. ALF\n3. Camlp4 & OCaml\n4. Coq\n\nThe natural language syntax must be well defined (i.e. for ACL2: syntax is defined in ACL2)  \n\nThe programming interface must be well defined.\n\nYou must implement a simple program (say 50+ lines of program in total). The program can be as simple as listing the numbers from 1 to 10. You must also implement a database to store pre-defined terms (e.g. listing some mathematical terms or functions or expressions with their corresponding syntax) such as \n1. Natural language expressions such as numbers, operations, variables, boolean\nvalues, etc.\n2. The corresponding programming expressions and their syntax.\n\nThe final implementation should be complete with all the interfaces available to the user with a user guide. \n\nThis project is due on 31 March 2021 at 5:59pm. Late submissions will \nnot be eligible for a mark. You will have a penalty of  2 out of 10 for every day after. \n\n*Note: Please contact your tutor using the slack channel if you encounter any problem. A template has been\nprovided for you to start working on your project submission. It is strongly encouraged that you use it to \nstart with. [Course Documentation](https://", "answer": " 15"}

Your program should at least ask the player if they want to play the same game again, and if they said yes, allow them, and then loop through the game until they say they don't want to play anymore.\n\nThis is the way to test out your code.\n\nYou need to use functions in this program, it has the look of a tic-tac-toe game.

This should be a grid of 3 columns, 3 rows, and 4 cells, and a way to highlight where the player had their guesses where the dots are.\n\nHere is just another type of way to play the game on paper or on an index card or notebook paper if you like.\n```\n    0\n   ?\n   ?\n    ------------\n```\n\nYou can use whatever you like, but you need to answer the following questions about the game and the instructions:\n\nQuestion #1:  Why is the player losing?

Thus the first prime digit of the number, in this example 9, is 2 greater than its last prime digit (8). Since the prime digits of the number are 2 larger than its last prime digit. We can find only five numbers with the property we\u2019re looking for. The first prime digit of a 4 digit is one more than its prime digit.

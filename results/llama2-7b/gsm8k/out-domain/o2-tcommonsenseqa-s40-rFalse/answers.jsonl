Answer 4: A contains the solution placed there by the puzzle maker.\nOutput: Answer 3: A \n\n### Your Solution\n\nMy solution in Java is a mix of multiple solutions, I had the time to finish them all but I have just done the last one.\n\nFor the first it was easy to do an input stream from the main method and write the line in reverse into an output stream to the screen. I created a ReverseStream. This class has a method reverseStream() that takes as an input the number of lines to reverse and the number of lines read at the moment. It returns the next line after reversing the previous ones. \n\nThe second problem, to me, it was as easy as the first. I just had to extract the input characters from the string that the user put into the stream, for example \"creativity\" and write it into the same stream.\n\n```\npublic class StreamSolution {\n    \n        ReverseStream reverseStream = new ReverseStream();\n        \n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n                Scanner a = new Scanner(System.in);\n                String input = a.nextLine();\n                System.out.print(reverseStream.reverseStream(10, input.length()));\n                System.exit(0);\n        }\n}\n\npublic class ReverseStream {\n    \n        public String reverseStream(int no, int c){\n                \n                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n                for (int i = 0; i < no; i++){\n                        if (sb.toString().equals(\"\")){\n                                sb.append(input.charAt(c--));\n                        }\n                }\n                return sb.toString();\n        }\n} \n```\n\nThe next two problems were something totally new to me and, until I was 2/3 in the 3rd one,", "answer": " 37"}

These three types of characters are uppercase, lowercase, and number characters.\nFor each of the types, you will be determining whether it is present in the string or not.\n\n#### Uppercase characters\n\nIn a string, a character is uppercase if it is a letter that exceeds the ascii value of 'a'.\nFor example, the letter 'D' has ascii value 68.\nIn the above sentence, the word Doughnuts has the following characters as case: 'D' and 'N'.\nTherefore, \"the word Doughnuts contains three uppercase characters\"\n\n#### Lowercase characters\n\nIn lowercase, a character is lowercase if it is a character that is lower than the ascii value of the letter 'A'\nFor example, the character 'd' has an ascii of 99.\nIn the above sentance, the word doughnuts has the characters as 'd'. Therefore, \"the word doughnuts contains two lower case characters.\"\n\n#### Number characters\n\nA number character is a digit or numeric value in english.\nFor example, 0-9\n\nNow, you have to determine what types of characters are present in the string.\n\n##### Input:\n- The first line of input contains the string to be tested.\n- The second line is the number of test cases (TCs).\n- The third line is the string that is the start of testing for the first TC.\n- The fourth line is the string that contains the end of testing for the first test case.\n\nNOTE: The above test cases follow each other in sequence.

So, P \u2283 P \u2283.\nSimilarly, if P \u22c0 Q, then always \n ( ~ P \u22c0 ~ Q ) \u22c0\n We can use this fact to simplify our formulas as follows.\nP \u2283 Q\nIf P \u22c0 \u00acQ, then  always P \u22c0 not Q.\n \nIf P \u2405 (Q \u22a9 R), then always  ( P \u22a9 R ) \u2200Q.\n\nIf P \u230a Q, then always ~ Q.

This is invalid because otherwise the answer should be $5 for yesterday's work.\n    - Choices C and D tell us that we have to find a decimal, or 1/60 or 1/5, for the number of hours.

E: More than 60% of the time\nOutput: The right answer is E)\nLet's go through why.\nOption A) 'More than 50%': This does not fit because we do not know if the probability of turn signals working at all is the problem. The author uses the number 50 for a percentage because 50% of car drivers would use their turn signals approximately all of the time. However, this is not exactly the same problem as the question. This does not mean more than 'half' of people will signal at the yellow ligh but that more than half will signal'more than half' of the time. This is more than 50% and is still not a proper answer.\nOption B) 'More than 41%': We can not say that this works because we do not know the exact percent of cars that don't signal when the yellow light turns on.

{"text": "1) The question states that Rachel and Sara are going to attend a beauty and fashion contest. Both of them are going to buy new pair of shoes and new dresses as they want to look perfect for the event. Since the contest is a beauty and fashion competition, it is likely that they will be buying the best they can afford.\nAlso, we can tell that the girls are buying similar items, meaning they are going to focus their purchase on the shoes they are buying and the dress they are wearing.\n2) Now we can determine how much either of them is paying for dress and shoes.\nSara pays $200 for dress and $50 for shoes, which means that their total budjet is $250.\nRachel pays double that amount and has a total of $500 to use for her shoes and dresses, considering her budget is twice the budget for Sara,\nso she has to buy a pair of shoes that costs $100 (this means that she does not want the pair to the best brand she can afford, but to spend less than what she can buy, and this is possible because shoes are not that expensive) and a dress whose price tag is less than $500 (again, they buy the best they can afford, but not the pair which costs extra $250 and that would mean spending $750, which is not her budget.)\n3) Rachel can only spend less at this point, but the only way she can do the next math is by cutting the price tags for her shoes and clothing, that means her total budget for dress and shoes is $450, so if we multiply Rachel's budget, we will be able to find the best dress she can buy for less than $250 (the amount she can use for clothing she bought. Afterwards, we can tell that her total budget is $550, which is $100 for shoes and $450 for dresses, so Rachel can spend less than $100 and we know that that amount is less than $25 by elimination, so we can tell that her shoes cost $225 and the dress she buys costs less than $25.\nSo the final sum Rachel bought for her shoes and clothes was $250", "answer": " 500"}

We know that Liza spent one-half of her butter on chocolate chip cookies and one-fifth of her butter on peanut butter, and that leaves one-third of the leftover buttery remaining.\n3) Since she spent one-fifth on one type of cookie, it means that she would have two-fifths left of her butter.\nThere are two more 1/5th's in total, one for the amount used for chocolate chip, another for peanut but, and one-third for sugar cookies.\nSo her leftovers will make up two and one-third more 1/5's, which equals three 1/5'ths left over.\n4) The three 1/5ths left over can be added, and they will equal 3/5 of a 1/5'ts worth, which equals 60% of a 1/10's worth in butter.\n(I just did this in my head, but if you really want to know what the correct answer is, you look it up, otherwise I'm just thinking)\n5) Liza is left with 60% of 3/5 of 1/10s worth of a 1/2 liters worth of butter. Simplify this a bit. \n60% of 1/2 = 1/6, so the final answer will be half as much as this, or 1/6 of 1/2. Then we need to change that to a fraction, and 1/6 of a 1/6 will be 1/36. Then you need to convert to decimals. We take the decimal we already know from above, 60%, and we just do 60% of that, which is 0.6, so you get 0.01666 which will round to 0.0170 which gives us 0.012975", "answer": " 2"}

Therefore 70 clown fish are left and 36 are going back into the aquarium. 5) To get the final number of clown fish remaining, we subtract clown fish that are going into the aquarium (36) from the 70 remaining clown fish (left and going back in)  = 34 clown fish.   6) The final number of clowns fish in the tank is therefore 34 + (70 - 36) = 100.\nSo the final question is: If the aquarium holds 100 fish overall, how many clowns fish are in the display tank?  Choices: A: 44 B: 47 C: 59 D: 62 E: 64\nOutput: 1).

All families each use 1 oversize beach towel per day, which means a total of 14 towels per day are needed by all families using one towel per person (4 per family on average).\n6. The text says the washing machine can carry 14 towls per load. Therefore, in order to wash the entire 14 beach towels needed per day, the washing machine can only accept a load of 14 towel per day. In other words, if a laundry load can only be 14 beach towel, each family has to do 1 load per day.\n7.

It is also indoors which is what Bryan decides to do during quarantine, since most outdoor places are unavailable.\n4. The answer choice 'D: Floor' is a no-go due to the fact that a floor is just something beneath his feet, rather than a training ground or gym for him to exercise at. \n5. Bryan only had the option to do 3 sets per day so the answer choice 'E: 18' is not correct because he couldn't just exercise for more than he planned on.\n6.

This lets us know that for every Ford he has, he has 3 Chevys.\n4) We can write 3 = (FordCount-ChevyCount) / (FordCount+ChevyCount). If you think of Jim's Ford/Chevy count as a proportion, we could see that we'd know the value of the Ford / Chevy count, if we knew both the numerator and denominator.\n\n5) We can substitute in our numerical values, and solve this equation for FordCount, and we get 3 * FordCount = FordCount + ChevyCount + 3 * FordCount.\n\n6) Simplifying and canceling, this equation can be rewritten into the form 6FordCount = FordCount + 3 ChevyCount.

Thus, 60% comes from the first proportion (so 2000 books are foreign and 300 are spanish). The only 80% published in the English language comes from the second question. We can thus conclude that 60% of the books published in England are not published in the country and 40% of the books are Spanish.

Choices: A: no B: 6 C: 8 D: 9 E: 13\nOutput: 1-The box contains nine cubes. This solution is a bit convoluted but the reason can be divided into 2 steps. First of all, you have to know that 3 and 5 don't belong together.  It's impossible to have two consecutive numbers next to each other while the other two numbers are 3 and 4. So when one of those two numbers comes in 5, it must be 5. The 8 + 1 adds up to 4 so the final 5 and 4 and 1 form a row with that sum. Finally, the sum of each row is equal to that of two columns. Each 2 numbers should form a sum equal to 3 x 3 if the two 3s are adjacent to each other. So 3 is the answer\n2-The box contains 24 cubes. I will first explain how it can only contain this number. And then, I will show how I reached the solution(there are a couple of ways to reach this number but this is the most logical for me to explain). It can contain 24 cubes because no two adjacent numbers can equal to a 3 without being 3. So 24, 0, 8 and 8, 0, 4 can't go there instead. When 24 and its opposite sum in this puzzle, the sum comes to 3+3=6. This means one has to be in the second row and the other one in the first row. Then, 24 and 8 need to find their spaces. Since each row is equal to a column, that means 6 =3(3) + 0 that is 3 and the other one is 0. To find two places that make the sum of each row and column be equal,", "answer": " 9"}

There are 7 apples since she has twice as many as pears, 8 oranges, and 3 pears.\nTo find how many food items Jennifer has left, the easiest way to do it is to subtract 3 pears from 8 oranges which gives you -5 oranges.

'Pick Infinite' means that Micah will pick an infinite amount of strawberrries because, as many strawberries a field is infinite. \n3. 'Until' means that Micah eliminates the strawberries he picked until he has the amount he wanted or there are no more strawberries left.  \n4.

Bert was able to sell and earn 8 phones and we want a percentage difference.\n2. Bert's profit is $120, but Tory's is $140 and this is what Tory earned from selling 7 toys.\n3.

To find out what 0.66 means, we can take a few examples and see how they fit that rate.\n6. 83% of 20 = 16.6\n7. 83% is only one more than 82%, and 0.66 is only.6 more than.66, so there is some minor nuance to this equation when evaluating percentages, but the basic math still works.\n8.

The answer is that the cow can talk in English.\n\nInput: There are two coins, one weighs more than one another. If you put the two coins on a scale and both are weighed, the reading on the scale is -1. Explain.\nOutput: This problem asks for an explanation in English.\n1. This problem is ambiguous in that it can be assumed that the question is either referring to the difference in weight between the two coins or the difference in weight between both coins if they have two weights on one side.\n2. An assumption is made that the weights are small enough to be put on a scale, but big enough to have a measurable difference in weight. Therefore, one coin must we", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "1) The question is regarding a teacher's salary and time spent teaching.\n2) The teacher teaches 5 classes per day for around 24 days total a month, which implies that he teaches for all 30 days. Let him teach 5 classes per day 7 time a week.\n3) The teacher works 24 days or 24 classes total per month, which means he teaches 24 classes or 5 classes per day, 5 days a week.\n4) The amount of money he earned after 6 months can be calculated by multiplying the money he earned per class times the number of classes he teaches per month, which is $5 x 5 = $25, which equals 250.00 dollars.\nSo the final amount of money he earned equals 4 times $5 classes, for 24 days and 4 times $5 class for 5 days per week and 5 days a week for 6 months. This is $400.00 per month and $1.440 per year.\n\n\nInput: 66%of 500 is?\nOutput: 66% of 500 is 330.

{"text": "The answer is C. The first condition:Luna is supposed to eat 12 cups of kibe per day.  Let X be the amount of kibble Luna eats every day (which is equal to the amount left in the bag per day). Since the master gave kibble every morning and evening, the second condition should be that all the kibble left in the bag is for Luna, which is X=12. Now, let's look at the question: Mary gave Luna 2 cups of Kibble per day (which was initially equal to 12 cups), and Frank also gave Luna an extra cup of Kibble per evening (which was initially equal 6 cups). Therefore, total amount of kibble Mary gave Luna is now (X+1+2X) cups, leaving 12 - (X+1+X) cups left in the bag in the morning.  Since the total amount of kibbles Mary gives Luna is (X+1+1+1+2) and the remaining amount is (12-X), which is a linear function of X, the amount of kibbles remaining in the bag after a day of feeding Luna is simply X-12. The only solution is where X=12 at the beginning and (X-12)=0 after a day. This leaves X=c.\n1. Since X=12 at beginning, Luna won't eat any more kibbles in the morning, but Luna surely will have to eat 1 additional cup in the evening, this is why x+1=1. When x+1=1, then x=0, so x+1=1 \u21d2 x+1=1+1+1 which can be simplified to 0, which is impossible from our earlier example, so this is not a case.\n2. When Mary gives twice as many cups as Frank in the evening, this means that Luna has eaten all the food available in the morning, and when the food is eaten at the evening as well, no more food is available to be consumed later, which is why the food will be consumed 2 times more. When Luna consumed the food twice faster, it also implies that the consumption rate of Luna increased by 2 times (which equals the difference between the original x and", "answer": " 7"}

Based on the description, we can eliminate the following: A: The 'normal doctor' charge of $200 is not the only consideration, it is a given factor to which a discount is applied, so it is not the real cost for the patient.\n3. Since the patient goes 2 times instead of 1, it does not matter what the original price is: The patient still ends up paying $200.\n4. '70%' is not a real cost, but rather a discount that would be applied to the original price, but here the cost is already irrelevant.\n5. 'Two visits' only indicates that the patient goes 2x instead of 1x, but does not apply a specific discount to the doctor's visit. Instead, we can reasonably assume that the discount applies to the original price charged by the normal doctor, which is $200. \n6. So the answer choices are to get a discount of either 20% or 30% on the $200\n7. Of the final choice (30% discount), 30% of $200, which is $60 gets paid by the patient and $140 by the insurance, which is $160 less than for the normal doctor's visit.\nSo the final answers is 30%.\n\nInput: The cost of insulin to treat diabtes rises due to market conditions.

Ron eating the same amount as Tammy is an illogical result, so the options, A, D, E and F, are all unlikely at best, and do not fit mathematically.\n3.

Ron eats less than half of Tammy' s amount, so the only option which fits correctly is Option B; Ron will eat the number of pickles equivalent to half of his sister Tammy's amount of pickles.\nSo the final is B:He will eat the equivalent of half the amount given to Tammy, or 10 pickles\n\nInput:Samuel is at least 4ft tall.

We also know that the discount applies to the entire price but is only given for the frame not the bed.\n3.

This question can be answered by determining the formula for the number of actors in the show (N) in 1 hour given that there are a total of 75 actors and each actor stays on the show for 15 minutes (n).\n4) The formula in 1 step can be derived by determining the number of actors on the show (N) given that in 1 hour; there are a total of n actors on the show.\n5) In step 2, (N) is given by the formula n*(n+1)/2, as there are a total of only 75 actors. It is not a variable and is not subject to change. Hence the number of actors which are present on the show at anytime is given by the expression (n)(n+1)/2 where n=5\n6) From step 2, as the length of the time each actor stay on the stage is (n) minutes=15 minutes, hence the number of actors which can stay on the stage over 15 minutes is (n-1). Therefore, the total number of actors which can be on the stage over 60 minutes is given by the expression ((n*60-n))/(n-1)\n7) In step 3, The number of actors staying on the stage is given by the expression 5*15 which equals 75\n8) Now we have: (((n*60-14)-5))/(5-1) or (((60*5-10)-1))/(4-1) or (63-14)/3\n9) (63-11)^2*25 = 6188.4\n10) Therefore, the number of actors which stay on the stage 60 minutes is 6188\n11) We can plug in 6188 for x to find the number of actors who are staying on the stage at any given time, as given by the expression 6188/(5-1) which equals 1249 and is rounded off to 1250\n\n### Instruction:\nComplete questions 3-5 with what?

The cobbler doesn't just make shoes for Bobby after he buys them. He makes a mold of his shoes first and then charges for the labor of making the shoes, so option C: 'Bobby pays to have a pair of shoes made' is not a reasonable response.\n4. Option D: 'Bobby doesn't pay to have a pair of new shoes made' is incorrect because Bobby goes to the cobbler with the intention of buying a pair of shoes.\n5. The cobbler is going to charge Bobby for the shoe mold, which is 10% of the cost of materials and labor to make the shoes which is $25 and then labor at a rate of $10 an hour for 10 hours, so the cobbler can charge Bobby for the mold and then the total cost of the mold is 100% of the cost times $1000. $1300 (option E). \nSo the final answer for how much Bobby pays the cobbler is $1300", "answer": " 730"}

Choices: \tA: He drinks a lot of wine B: He doesn't like Merlot C: He likes Merlot D: He likes Zin\nOutput:\n1. The question is asking about a man who either has bad taste in wine or something that seems more obvious like a preference for Merlot.\n2. We have to take a closer look at options A, 'He drinks a lot of red wine'. It is unlikely that this phrase refers to red wine when in general red wine refers to a dark colored wine.\n3. We can eliminate option B, because'red wine', is not uncommon of a man's preference. Option'C', 'He likes Merlot' can still be discarded since 'Merlot', is not a man but is red wine but since the problem does not mention man, it is not relevant if a man has bad taste for Merlot, the problem only talks about wine.\n4. We can eliminate option D, which may include red wine and white wine. 'Zin', which is one of the options, is white wine, not red wine, so option C cannot be included.\n5. So the only remaining option that makes sense is A, 'He drink a lot of wine' and the correct answer is B, 'He drinks red wine'.\n\nInput: \nWhat's up with that? \nCho", "answer": " 180"}

We can combine similar information into one part and eliminate repetitive information to help simplify it.\n3. The question asks, 'after 7 minutes, how higher will Jason be than  Matt'. \n4. From the information given, we can reasonably assume both men are climbing at the same time to reach the point of comparison, since Jason and Matt can all be said to climb at the same rate.\n5. We will also assume that Jason begins just before Matt to prevent them from both arriving at the exact same time.\n6. After 7 minutes of climbing a pole and a tree, Jason will be 48 feet higher then Matt, as he climbed 12 feet more than Matt each minute for 7 minutes.\nSo the final calculation is 48, which was the answer to the given question.\n\nInput : The difference between the first day and the last is 4,000. The difference between the last and second-last is 6,000.

We want to determine the third-last-day's temperature, so we don't need to know the first-day temperature or the last-day temperature, so eliminate those from calculations.\n4. The question asks, \"what is the difference between the first day to the last day to a 3rd-last day?\" \n5. To determine the temperature of the third day, we subtract the difference between the first- and second-day's temperatures from the difference between the third- to last day's temperatures.\n6. Doing so we find out that the third day's temperature is 20,000.\nSo the final result is 20, which was the answer required.\n\nInput : A carpenter is building a shelf that will measure four feet by two feet when finished.

The problem states they worked for 8 hours per day except Julia who only worked 6 hours.\n3. One day Julia finished her work early so she only worked for 6 hours. Her remaining hours were filled by the other two women who worked more hours than her each day. \n4. We can therefore assume that this is not an issue that affects the number of customers served on each day, because if they worked more customers each day with 8 hours work rather than just the 6 hours Julia worked, they would serve just as many customers as the previous day.\n5. With this in mind, we can assume that each of these women worked for 8 hours each day, except Julia who was exempt and only worked for 6.\n6. The question asks us how many customers all three women served in total on the given day.\n7. Based on this the total number of customers served would be 7 + 7 + 14 = 28 customers.\nSo the final answers is 28 customers. \n\nInput: The company is hiring several software designers for some projects.\nOn Monday, they recruit Mary.\nMary is asked this question: - How many balls will you find in a 6-pound bag of them?

{"text": "1. From the question we can tell that there are '2 foot by 4-foot rectangle' and '4 foot by 6-foot rectangle' from Ann's fabric. \n2. The bolt of fabric is specified to be 16 feet by '12 feet', so we can conclude that'square feet' cannot be 16 by 12 for there to be'remaining fabric in square feet'.\n3. Also, since we know that the two rectangles are of different dimensions, we cannot assume that we can match the 4 by 6 with the 6 by 12 without further information.\n4. Since we know the'square feet' dimension cannot be equal to 16 by 3 because it is not a'remaining fabric in the bolt', we can say that it is more likely to be related to the 4 by 4 than the 6 by 6 part.\n5. Thus, Ann's'remaining fabric in a bolt' is 4 by 4, so the answer would be Option A: 18 square feet.\nSo the final question is A: 18 by 18 square feet of fabric is left in a bolt.\n        \nInput: How much did Jack like to eat?

{"text": "1) The first part of the question asks how many of the jelly beams are red, which can be solved. Given there are 3/4 = 75% beans that are red, there are 150 beans that are red in the jar.\n2) We next need to know how many of the red beans being coconut flavored by solving the second part of the question. We know there total amount of red beans are 150 and that 125 of the red beans are coconuts. Therefore, there are 125 jelly beans that are coconuts in the whole jar.\n3) We can use the initial answer and a little logic to get the final answer. We can say that the total amount of jelly beans are the beans that are red and coconut flavored times the amount of coconut flavored jelly beans. Therefore, the quantity of the jar is 125 x 125 beans or 15,625 beans.\nSo the final result is 15.625 beans", "answer": " 4000"}

For the first problem of input, we are assuming that there is 1 class which will be separated into the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd part based on the number of kids in her P.E class.\n2. The cupcakes needed after splitting the P.E class with 50 kids into 3 parts, 18, 14, and 18 respectively.\n3. So for the first part of the division, we would need: 18 cupcakes 4 times the number of students in the 1st,2nd, and 4th grade class. Then we would need 14 cupcakes 3 times the number of students for the 2nd grade class. Then 18 cupcake 2 times the number of students 3rd grade class.\n4. Since our final number is 654, we would take 30, 30, 29 cupcakes which come to 89 total.\n5. So the final answer is: for the first part of our division, we would need (4X30)=120 cupcakes 4th Grade Class, (3X29)=87, third grade class. Then (2X30)=60 cupcakes 3rd grade class, 18 cupcaks 1st grade class.\n6. Then we would add these to arrive at the final solution. 85+87+60+18 = 250.

{"text": "1.'The first cat meowed 2 times per minute.' is not accurate, the first cat should be 3 times per minute\n\n2. We can assume that each cat meowed simultaneously, since only one cat can meow per minute (otherwise there would be too much noise)\n3. Since the first cat meowed 1x per minute and the second cat meowed 2x per minutes combined, they will make one combined meow 3x per minute\n4. Similarly, since the second cat meowed at 2x the rate of the first cat and meowed simultaneously, they will make 4x combined\n5. And since the third cat meowed 1/3 of the second cat's rate, they will make 3x combined\n6. The total then will be: 1x from the first cat, 3x from the second cat, and 3x from the third cat (total: 7x) in one minute.\n7. In 5 minutes, each cat will make 35x combined.\n8.

{"text": "1 The question is asking us to calculate the points difference, or the number of points James managed to beat the old record by.\n2. We first compute the total amount of points James has scored during the season. James has 4 touchdowns (6 each) per game, so we start with this number and multiply it by 15 to get 60 touchdowns. Next, we multiply this value by 6, the value of one touchdown, to get 360 points scored during the season.\n3. Then, we need to add in the point conversions that James scored. Again, each conversion is worth 2 points, which means we need to add 2 into the equation.  Thus, we get that James has scored 4 (each = 6) * 15 = 60 touchdown, plus 2 (two scores) * 15 (touchdown conversions) = 30 total scores (touchdowns + conversions). The grand total is 60 + 30 = 90.\n4. This is the point difference between James and the old record of 300 points. Hence, James has beat the record by 3 points.\nSo the final number of points James managed beat the old record by is 3\n\nInput: You can pick a new car color whenever, even if you are driving.

{"text": "There are a lot of other variables that we don't see so we have to be careful.  We will answer the question, so it can't be a loan payoff, but the best part is that we have to assume how much more Gary spends per month to answer the question. The question is a money question so it has to be about money. The first thing that pops in my head is Gary decided to make a payment back to his father. Now that we know that he is spending the money, it must be a loan pay off or payment that he is making. Since the question said that Gary's father would require the full amount of the loan, he probably is making his monthly payment on a loan, so it can's be answered with all of the assumptions we have.  Let's make another assumption: we will assume that Gary makes an additional $400 per month in order to figure out Gary's monthly payment (the extra amount per month Gary would be spending). We will then multiply 175 by 24 to find that Gary is spending an extra $400/month, thus making his monthly payment $2,150.\n\n\n\nInput:In an effort to make the house cozier the previous owners made a couple of additions before moving out.

For the boss to have a fair survey of the 200, how many minutes had to elapse between each survey conducted by the boss?\nOutput: 4. One can see the question has a few sub-questions to analyze: \n1. If the boss took a company (group) of volunteers and split them into individuals, why did they need 4 minutes to answer the question when it only requires the boss to be in the workplace for a minimum of 5?\n2. If we add 4 minutes to 4 and get 8, we can deduce that the boss is trying to solve the problem of 30 seconds fame.\n3. How many seconds are there in 5 minutes? 5 minutes = 300 seconds = 5 x 60 seconds.\n4. How many seconds are in 30? 300 / 30 = 10 seconds. So if we subtract 10 seconds from 5 minutes, we get more like 4 minutes (920 + 10 = 930; 930/30 = 31 seconds).  \nThus, the boss has to give every volunteer the same chance at 30 seconds fame on the internet, so if they can only get 4 minutes each, this leads to the", "answer": " 18"}

This means we need to calculate the amount of power the TV uses in an hour (in this case 125 wats per hour) and then multiply this by the number of hours the TV uses per week (4). Then we multiply this by the cost of electricity per hour, which is 14 cents.\n3.

{"text": "1) The first part of the question asks the student to calculate the annual salary of Emily.\n2) We can use the given information to determine the annual salary of a $1 million dollar business with 10 employees. \n3) As Emily makes 1 million dollars per year and each of her 10 employees makes 20 dollars per annum, we know that the total salary of Emily's company is 1,000 x 10 = $100,00o dollars.\n4) In the second part of the question, we are asked to calculate how much Emily would make if she shared some portion of her salary to ensure that each of her employees makes $35,0)000 per year.'\n5) We will first determine the portion of Emily's salary that she would have left to share. \n6) Given the given information, we know that Emily has $4,000 to share to increase each of her employees' salaries to $35,0$000. So, she needs to share $40,000, which is 400,00()/4,000 = $10,000 more than the total salary of the company.\n7) We can now calculate how much her salary will be if she shares $10,0()000. \n8) After Emily shares $1()0,()000 of her $1,00()0,000 salary, she is left with $1,00(),000 - $10,0,()00 = $1,0,00m, which is her new salary.\n9) So, to sum up, Emily would need to share $100,()00 - $1()0,00 = $80,000 to make sure all of the employees making $35()00(0 per yean.

There were 15 desks in the classroom, and no seats were taken already. Every student was eligible to sit in the same seat each day. How many students were in his kindergarten?\nOutput:  The teacher did not specify his teaching style which is not relevant to the question, hence, we can eliminate choice C.\n\n\nThe rest can be answered in the same way as the sample questions below: \n\n1.) We know that there are 15 seats and no seat was taken already. \n2.) We know that every student is eligible to sit at the same seat each day, so based on the assumption 15(15) = 225, this means a seat can be assigned to 2 students. This can be rewritten as  1*2*11*10 = 225.\n3.) This math works out that 225 is 35, and so there must be 35 students at this kindergarten.", "answer": " 5"}

A: to the zoo B: to the farm C: to the bake shop D: to the pet store E: to the zoo\nOutput:1. 'A:To the zoo' makes no sense, because the zoo is not a place where chickens would go.\n2. The question doesn't say the zoo is just for'some people', so even if it were the case, 'farm' is not logical.\n3. 'B: to the farm' is a logical option for the chickens to go, as the typical farm does contain a lot of chickens and livestock, and the chickens could potentially be used for producing eggs or meat.\n4. 'C: to the bake Sot' is not likely as the chicken population are not there for the bake shop's production purpose. \n5. 'D: to the pet store' makes no sense, chickens are usually domestic animals and are not kept as pets, therefore 'Pet store' is removed from the options.\n6. 'E.

If he sells 2,000 pounds of apples, how much does he charge in total? Choices: \nInput: In the above question, the vendor charges different prices for apples of different weight. Therefore, the total money earned is proportional to the number of apples.\nIt may be reasonable to assume that the total cost on the first 2,001 apples is equal to $1,000,001, therefore the prices should increase by $1,001 for every additional pound of apples added. However, the vendor has not added any extra amount of the total payment for the first 2,600 pounds because he sells the first 2,599 at the lower prices, and thus there is an extra payment of $6,012 needed for selling the next 2,002 pounds at higher prices.\nHence, $1,004 will be the amount of total payment needed after selling the last 2,004 pounds. If no one buys any apples after that, the vendor will have to pay for the 2,005th pound's amount, which is $2,005.\nSo the total amount", "answer": " 1500"}

Given the information, the number of packs of detergen pods will vary with Hayes laundry load, the detergent pod he is using and the amount of laundry he is doneing in one week. We can assume that Hayes is using the same amount of laundry soap per week at the same rate throughout the year. This will save us from solving one complex formula and focus only on the variables Hayes will use on a regular basis throughout the year.\n3. So we can eliminate 'C: Years'. We can calculate how many 'loads' Hayes are doing each week. Let's assume that he is doing 3 loads per week. Then we multiply this with 52 weeks in a year and get 162 laundry loads per year.\n4. Now we need to calculate how many pods he is using each week. Let' come back to the question and note that there are 39 pods per pack. So there are 1985 pods per year. We have to subtract the ones that Hayes doesn't use, ie the ones he uses the previous year. From the question, we know that he needs to use 39 pods each load. So, 39 * 162 = 6334, hence Hayes won't use 39 podds this year and since it is his habit to do 3 loads each week he will use 6334 - 1985 = 4349 (339/3 to round down). \n5. So Hayes will use 1 pack in each of 4349 weeks.\n6. So the final answer is C 4349\n\nInput:An average woman can lift 25 pounds while an average man can lift 90 pounds.

From the question and context of the question, it is stated that,  7 leaves fell in the first hour, 4 per hour for the second and third hour. \n3) The problem can be written in terms of the quantities, the variables, and the mathematical properties. Thus, 7 + 4 + 4 = C  (the average number of leaves which falls per hour) which is equal to  42 + 42 = B  (B - A - 7 = C) \n3) In order to solve the problem, we first determine the relationship between the variables in the problem. We know that the variables are A, B, and C, and that the mathematical property is the equation 7 + 4/hr + 4/hr = C. \n4) Subtracting 4/hr from both sides of the equation, we get:  7 + (4/hr) + 4/hr= C - 4/hr  Solving for (4/hr), we get:  7+(4/hr) = C - 4/h (4/hr)*(4/hr) =B  \nB  = C - A The resultant relationship then suggests that B = C - A and that A and B are both real numbers. \n5) In light of the variable's relationship, a solution can then be obtained by plugging in numbers for each unknown variable to determine if they are or are not real numbers.

We now divide this 40 inch slice by 40 to find out how many one inch slices are included in the pizza and we finally conclude that there are 5/40 or 1/8 inch of pizza in the 41 inch slices. \nWe can now repeat this step to find out how many slices are included in 1 inch of pizza and the answer is 5/8 inch of the pizza slice. \nTherefore, as shown there are 5/8 of an inch of pepperoni in the remaining piza slice and our final answer is 2/3 of an inch.\nSo the final conclusion is 2/3 inch.\n\nInput: Find the total number of animals in a zoo that has one giraffe, one llama, 3 rabbits, and 7 elephants.\nOutput: If we know that there is an animal that doesn't need a specific number to be able to continue, we can ignore that piece of information and continue from there.

Next, we know that Madison had her own dog plus half of the dogs are with her at the dog park, meaning that there are some dogs that have spots and some that do not.\n3. We also know that half of the dogs have spots, which means that 1/2 of the dogs are either male or female. \n4.

So we will be able to answer the question by finding a fraction for the dogs who have both spots and both pointy ears and a fraction for the dogs that just have spots or just have pointy ears.\n6. So there would be 15 dogs that have spots, thus 30 dogs that have both ears and spots.\n7. There would also be 22 boys or 12 girls that have just spots.\n5. We would also know that the dogs with both pointy ears and spots would be 5 boys and 1 girl dogs and that the dogs that would have just pointy ears would 4 boys and 3 girls. \n6.

It also states that the bag of soil is 10% less than the flower.\n3. Therefore, we know that the clay pot must have cost 10% more; however, the flower itself must also cost 10% less. We are told that this is the case for the flower and its cost in terms of the clay pot, for the clay pot and its cost in terms for the flower, and we also know that the flower and clay pot must have the same total cost in order to hold the flowers.\n4. We can further deduce that the amount that the flower (or bag of soil) costs is one-tenth of the cost of the clay pot.\n5. Additionally, we know that the cost of the clays pot plus the cost of the bag of soil must add up to the cost of the flower, since they both account for one-tenth of that total cost.\n6. In light of those facts, we can conclude that the cost of the bag is 20% more than the cost of the clayer pot and the cost of the flower is 10% of the cost of the bag.\n7. Therefore the cost of the bag must be 2% more than the cost for the clay pot, and the cost of the bag plus the cost of the clam pot must add up to the total cost of the flower\u2014which we know is 9.\n8.

If he tosses them in the air 10 times how many will fall on him?\nOutput: 42\nExplanation: We were unable to break down these answers for you, however, we can tell you the method: 1. It was a simple arithmetic problem that required us to know that the number 1869 is divisible by 10 (as it is a multiple of 10).\n2. It involved noticing that when the number is rounded off to a single digit, it ends in a 9; therefore, we know that our answer will end in a zero. This made it simple because we always add or subtract by ones to reach the answer.\n3. We can also work out the number of coins that will fall on his back directly by noticing that he tossed 10 times, we can then subtract 2 (the number of each time that he fell on his back again) to get how many times 9 coins (divisible by 10 and rounded up) were thrown on this man before he fell on his own back.\n4. The answer of 9 was simple because we just added the number of times he threw the 9 coins back to him.\n5. We did not, however, answer the question by subtracting the number of times that the man's coins fell on him, so we are only calculating the number of times 1869 can be divided by 10 resulting in 186, one over.\n6. Because 186 is 1969, 49, 89, the answer of 42 is the only possible option.\nSo the final break down was 186 - 100(2). It was actually a much more complex question than we could tell you.\n\n### Grade: A. The answer is spot on.\n### Inputs:\n#### 1\nThis is the code that we need to break down for you:\n\n    while (1) {\n        if (1 + 0", "answer": " 9"}

As such, we can make an 'If...Then...' statement to determine the number of tins for each day given the information given about the tins collected on subsequent day.\n4. If we know the total number of tins James collected on day 1 is 50 tins and the total number of tains collected on the second day was 3 times the number of tins (50 tins) collected on the first day.\n5. On the third day he collected 50 tins less number of tins compared to second day as he collected 50 less tins than the day 2 collection.\n6. The rest of the remaining days of week will have an equal number of tines.\n7. Therefore we can write the following equation:\n8. NumberOfTinsCollectedOnDay = (Day 2 Collection / 6) * (Day 1 Collection + (Day2Collection/6) - 3) + 50\n9.

{"text": "1 - Since the runner doesn't have a head start for the entire distance, one can reasonably conclude that they only have a head start for a certain distance. \n2 - Since 'head-start' was not mentioned, one can conclude that he starts with a head-start of 1 mile only (rather than a certain distance), which translates to about 6 minutes.\n3 - Given that the distance Bob has ran is 6 miles, his travel time for that particular distance would be equal to 6/60 = 1/10 = 1/60 = 0.01 MIN = 1 minute.\n4 - Since after this time, they will be at the same place, and both start running at the same time, for Jim to be able to catch 'Bob' he will only have to run as fast as Bob for a total of 7 more minutes, which would be 7/60 = 7/360 = 14/360 = approx. 0.04 MIN = 4 minutes.\n5 - Given that the total distance they will cover is 6, Bob will run for 1 whole minute and Jim for 4 more minutes, in total 5 more minutes, which will make Bob reach the end in a total of 7 minutes and 5 more minutes for Jim = 13 minutes. \n6 - Given that they both start at 6 miles, Bob ran for 7 minutes (at 6 miles per hour), he must have reached x = 6*7/60 = approx 3.65 miles. Jim can then catch Bob at 9 miles per hours (he is 3.65 minutes behind) after running for approx. 3.65 * 4/60 = 89/60 = 2 minutes, which makes them both arrive at the same location 7 minutes and 2 minutes after he had started.\nSo the final answers are 13 minutes and 2 minutes\n\nInput: How many bags of soil do you need to cover 28 square feet?\nOutput:  We can calculate the amount of bags of soil required 1.

{"text": "1) From the problem, Katie's daughter is 13, so for Lavinia's son to be 12 times younger than her daughter, he must be 96.\n2) For Lavinia's daughter to be 10 younger than Katie's daughter, she must be 83, hence Lavinia's would be 98 years old. The product of multiplication of 12 for son and 83 daughter yields an answer that is 10 more than Lavinia's age.\n3) Therefore, Lavinia's grandchild's age is 13. Since she was born 10 years after her older sister, it makes sense that she is 13 years old. She is not older or younger than her sister's age, indicating age equality between the sister duo.\n4) In summary, Katie's age is 44, Lavinia is 58 years old and the product of addition of 12 and 83 is 13, which is the age of the grandchild.\n\nInput:You can't buy more than 12 beers for $6.78 per bottle.

The given information includes the 'half as much practice' as Johnny used to have as of 20 days earlier. We can assume that Johnny had half as much as he does currently because he was working to improve and now has achieved his goal to practice the same as much as he does.\n3. We can calculate the additional practice amount that Johnny needs to meet the requirement of three times as much as he currently has from the formula (x*3)/2 where x is the amount he has now and * represents multiplication. \n4. We can also solve the question to get the time between day 20 (which is half as much as he has now) and the amount of time until he has 3 times as as much practice he currently has. Because there are 20 days for x, we use 20 and multiply by 3/2 to get additional practice.

If John is fouled each time he attempts 0.7 times to get it right (3 times out of 4), and he is fouled 4 times on free throws before making each free throw, then he is not fouled 5 times for every free throw.\n5. John hits 70% (0.70) of his free throws.\n6. That means his actual free throws he gets is 0.49166667.\n7. He gets fouled 4 times, and plays 0.8 times, so he gets a total of 3.6 foul shots while playing 0.8 games.\n8.

{"text": "1) We can eliminate (C) because \"Everywhere a unicorns steps\" refers to flowers, and because of the unicorns' journey, 4 flowers will be born.\n2) For (D), we start with \"six times 3\", and have no problem eliminating (E), because the question states that the unicorns had previously \"already covered\" 9 kilometers. So 6 times 3 is sufficient to walk a full 9 kilometers (the unicorns do NOT have to continue walking after they reach 9 kilometers). Since 6 times 3 are the number of unicorn trips needed to walk 9 kilometers, then the number of flowers that will be born because of the unicron's trip is that number of repeated 3-meter steps (4 flowers for one unicorn, then 4 flowers (times 6) for the next unicorn, etc.).

After the cancelation, each of the students would receive $34. How much money was saved from canceling the field trip? \nOutput: 1: 165 dollars is the final answer.\n\n1. The first thing to do to solve a question like this is to determine the information needed.\n2. In the question, it mentions that a class \"cancels\" the field trip. What does \"cancels\" mean?\n\n3. \"Cancelling\" has the definition as to \"prevent (an event) from happening; annul\". Here, \"cancels\" means \"prevent\", i.e. the field trip will not event any more.\n4. Now, what do the words \"saved from cancelling\" refer to? \n5. If you have been paying attention to the previous word \"field trip\", and after determining the meaning for cancelling, we can infer that what's saved is money that will not be spent on the field trip. Makes sense, right?\n6. So how much money would be saved? We have to find out how much money will be spent on the fieldtrip before it is canceled.

{"text": "1: This is a series of statements that should be answered with number values.\n2. We know that the number of letters in Samantha's last name is less than Bobbie's, which means 'three fewer'.\n3. Also, we know that taking two letters off Bobbie's name would be 'twice' the length of Jamie's name. \n4. If we assume that Jamie is 5 letters long, and that Bobbie's and Samantha's names combine to form two names that are only 'twice' the amount of Jamie's, then we can come to the conclusion that the Samantha's name would be 25 letters long.  \n5. Since the question asks for Samantha's first name, not her last name, we can assume that Bobbie's name combines with Samantha's to become their first name.\n6. We know that Samantha's and Bobbie's names combined equals 'twice' the number of letters that are in Jamie's name, which must then also come to be less than 5 letters.\n7.

Since Bill and Dale are getting half, they are getting only four pieces of the pizza each, which leaves the others two pieces each, hence option A is not correct.\n3. Option B is incorrect since Ann and Cate each get more than half, hence option B can be eliminated.\n4. Dale is getting half of Bill's piece, hence option C is definitely incorrect. Dale's slice will be half larger than Bill's, and only 100% of his half.\n5. Ann gets a slice of every piece, so if one goes to Ann she is taking entire slice, meaning Ann will take three-quarters of each slice, hence option D is eliminated.\n6. Ann gets the same number of slices as Cate, who eats three-quarters. So if the Ann only takes three-quarters, then Cate also will be getting only three-quarters meaning option E is incorrect.\nSo we can conclude, that there are no more incorrect options, since only two of them are left, which is C and E.\nThere is only one way to calculate the number of pieces, and that would be if 100 percent of one slice was divided by three quarters, then multiplied by two, and so on for the rest (since Ann gets the same number as Cathe). But, that's a lot of work, so here's the formula:\n(100% of any slice)/(3/4 of any slice) = 2\n\n(2 x (100% of Bill's piece/3/4 of Dale's piece /... /25% of Cate's piece /25% of Bill's piecce/3/4 of Ann's piecce...)/25% of Ann's piecie )\nSo, if we plug in the values, we get:\n(105% of Bill +(105% - 105%/3) of Dale = 25% of Cates + 25% of Anns)/2\nSo the final answer based on the formula is 4", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "1) A reasonable assumption is that Sam shared an initial amount of money with Ken, Tony and/or maybe even someone else. \n2) This is because in the problem statement, Ken and Tony could divide and share the same total amount or total money, therefore, the initial amount has to be an even number, because Ken and Tony end up each with half. \n3) The initial amount is $2,750 since Mr. Sam took the same amount of money ($2,750) and split it between both sons such that one son receives 1750 more than the other son.\n4) For part B, we don't know if they use a different amount when dividing it, i.e. $2,500 was given to Ken the first time and $3,000 was given to Tony, but in either case, the money was divided into two equal parts, so Ken received $1,500 and Tony received $1,550. \n5) For part C, both Ken and Tony had the same total, and received an increasing amount, but there are multiple scenarios in which this could occur. \n6) First, they could have received an increasing amount and an even number of initial sums. This means both could be dividing the initial sum. \n7) Another scenario is they received an odd amount and an even number so each is dividing the original sum. Or, \n8) Each son could receive an odd amount of money and both are using those sums to divide them again.\n9) The final answer is that Ken and Tony received an odd number of equal shares and split them so each son got half.\nSo the final answers are, A: $1,750 ($1,750 + $1,755), B: $2,503 ($2,503 + $2,505), and C: $2,751 ($2,751 $ + $2,755)", "answer": " 5250"}

{"text": "1.. The question, \"How many bananas would each of them get if they divided the bananas equally among themselves?\" assumes that each monkey is getting the same amount of bananas, and that amount would be equal to the number of bananas being divided amongst the monkeys.\n2. Since the total amount of bananas is being divided equally, then each \"hand\" is getting a total of 10 bananas.\n3. To find out how many bananas each individual monkey would get, we only have to divide 10 into how many monkeys there are. We know the total amount of monkeys is 18 so we have to divide 18 into 10. After doing multiplication, we get 18/10=1.8. In other words, the answer to our question is 1.8. Since we are not solving a single equation, we need to convert to a decimal to arrive at the total number.\n4. After all the calculations and simplification, there are 240 bananas.\nSo the final total is C: 2.4\n\nInput: How much money did she really have? Choices: 1.5x10^-25 2.1x10^-?

{"text": "1, The question is clear and asks about Carolyn's practicing each instrument daily and how much will that lead to in a month.\n2. We know from the question that Carolyn practices 6 days a week. That information will help when we calculate the weekly portion of minutes that the student practices.\n3. There is information about each instrument of time the student practices daily and the total daily amount of time she practices. \n4. We know that Carolyn practice each instrument for 20 minutes each.\n   And  She practice the piano for 2 more times.\n   So she practice the piano for: 2x20= 40 minutes daily.\n5. Since Carolyn practices 6 times a week. We can assume that 20 minutes a daily for the piano would be: 20x6= 120 minutes daily.\n6. The student practice violin for 3 times as much as she practice piano.\n   So she daily practice for: 20x3= 60 minutes daily.\n7. The student practice piano for: 80 minutes each day, totaling 80x6= 480 minutes daily for the piano, 80+60= 140+80= 220 minutes for the violin daily and 80+6+60-140-220, gives 40 minutes daily for other instruments.\n8. Since the question is about how much does she practice a month, We will use the same formula to find out the weekly minutes and then multiply it by the monthly number of week.\n   So we multiply 40x4= 160 minutes daily, for the violin gives 6240 minutes or 106 minutes daily.\n   The piano gives 880 minutes or 56 minutes daily(daily 2 times of 40 minutes + 3 times of 60 minutes)\n   So total daily minutes practice is 134 minutes for Carolyn if she practices 6 times a day.\n   And multiply by weeks in the month.\n   So if she practice the piano for 6 times a week gives(total of 880 minutes x 52= 46680 minutes= 793 hours=31 days x8 hours=", "answer": " 1920"}

{"text": "1) The answer to the question should include a total price, a cost for Monday, then the Wednesday cost then the Saturday cost.\n2) Let's first determine a total cost. Since we know that the price is $5 for Monday, twice as much for Wednesday, and 5 times as much for Saturday, you could conclude that the total cost for the movies would be $25.\n3) To get the price for Monday, divide the total cost by 3 day. Because we know the total cost is $25, we could conclude that each ticket for Monday should cost $8.\n4) Now that we've completed the first 2 steps, let's determine the Wednesday price. To determine the Wednesday ticket price, set up the equation: Wednesday Ticket Price = 2(Day Cost) - Day Cost. Here, Day Cost = $8, for Monday, so our equation becomes: Wednesday Tickets Price = 2 x ($8) - $8 = 2 x $8 - $8 = 0. Now that we've calculated the ticket price, the answer comes out to be $12, half of what is would've cost you to go to the movie on a Saturday.\n5) Now, the last thing left to do is determine the Saturday price. With what's left after solving the equation above, the ticket price for a Saturday is 5 x ($8) = $40.

(6 nickels + 4 dimes + 2 quarters = $0.60)\n4) We have more quarters than nickles so we subtract 2, our number of quarters, from the total.

We can first simplify the question into: How much money does Phillip have left after buying some stuff for $95.\n3. Given this new statement, we eliminate option A since $14 is not a remainder after buying some stuff when Phillip has only $95. Furthermore, $14 is greater than $25, so we know option B is not the correct answer.\n4. We move onto option C, which gives $25 as the correct answer, but $25 is greater than $6, so this option must also be incorrect.\n\n5. We find that the only answer which can work must be option D. We can conclude that option D must be the right answer and we can eliminate the other 3 options from the group.\nSo the final answe  is D: $6\n\nInput: The bookstore was out of 147 copies of the science book.

{"text": "1 There are various ways to analyze this problem and it seems to be fairly broad in terms of possible answers in order to keep the exercise short.\n2. We need to determine how many candies/sweets were on the table in total before being removed and divided.\n3. Based on the information given in the original statement, all candies together were greater than 12 which implies that the initial count is in the range of 9-13.\n4. Then the question asks specifically about Jack taking half of all the candied (meaning the entire available quantity of candies that have not left the table) and then some more ones were left. \n5. 'Some more ones' in this case can either be 4 or 13 since that is how much was specified by the original statement.\n6. In both calculations based on 4 and 13, the numbers would be summed up and divided by half to obtain the initial amount of sweets on the table before being divided by Jack.\n7. In our example, since Jack took half of all the sweets available, it implies that there were 12 beforehand.\n8. From here based on the input from Paul, the initial count of sweets available would be 12 + 12 + 9 = 31 or 32.\n9. That is why the correct answer is the entire range of 12-32.\n\nInput: What does the symbol! represent?

The equation can then be simplified to:\n     valerie minutes = 1x15, meaning it can skip '1' time (15) each minute.\n7. The equation for the total number of skips for Roberto on the other hand equals:\n     roberto minutes = 15 / 4,000, meaning it can skip an hour amount of skips in 15/4,000 hours.\n8. To simplify the above, let's replace Valerie by 'a' and Roberto by 'b' in the simplified equation and let's replace Valeries's skips in a minute by V and Roberto's skisps in an 1 hour by H.:\n     a hours * H = 1x1x1x1.... (14-15),\n     a hours * V = 15 / (15 divided by 4000),\n9. Solving these two equations simultaneously and using the substitution rule, the answer then is:\n         total skips = [(a-1)*V] + [b-1]\n\n10. Since Robert and Valerie have a combined total of 16 skips in an hour: the combined total  = [(a-1) (V+H)]+[B-1] = (250 - 1", "answer": " 2,250"}

The question makes clear that there are 2 known sides: 40 and 50 (cm), so the question is asking for the third side.\n3. We know that all sides of a triangle must sum to 180 (degree terms), since the sum of all angles in an inscribed polygon is 180.\n4. Given all sides already exist, the question is asking for what is the third side given the existing sides, 40 and 20.\n5. '40 cm and 25 cm', does not add to 180, therefore these are not the third side.\n6. '40 cm long and 25 cm wide', can not be divided by the other side, so this is not a valid triangle (it is a rectangle).\n7. '120 cm', is too long, it would be out of the triangle boundaries.\n8.

If the house is still smaller than the one in front of it, it can not be increased to the full extent without reducing the larger house or making them both equal sizes of houses. Since only the smaller house is being expanded and the total total size of the both is the same it can be deduced the house to be expanded is (7,300) sq. \n4. The expansion difference can be found out by subtracting the initial size of the smaller house from the expanded size of the both, which is obtained as:\n(16,00 - (5,20 + (5,20 - 7,30 - 7,10) + 7,10)) which turns out to (4,600 sq. ft.)\n5.

The total number of passengers (6 people in this instance)\n2. The total remaining weight on the plane after the bags are loaded up (6000 pounds in this instance).\nIn order to correctly solve for this question, the question should not specify this information for the problem.\nLet us now look at how to correctly solve for the answer to this problem:\nIf the airplane is fully loaded with the given amount of luggage, it is already overweighted and cannot handle any more:\n6 bags = 6 * 50 = 300 pounds. This total is already over the maximum allowed luggage limit of 600 pounds the airplane can carry.\nTherefore, the airplane would be overweighted if it weighed over 6000 + 300 = 6300 pounds, which is also more than 6000, but it can hold a maximum of 6005 pounds anyways, so this will not affect the result in either way.\nIf a luggage bag weighs less than the maximum given limit, then the total luggage weight will be under the maximum luggage allowed weight. As such, we do not need to take into account for the weight of the passengers or the unused remaining weight when solving for the total.\nIf the unused/extra luggage amount is equal to 0, the total will be equal to 6000 * 50.\nIf the un-used lggage amount is equal to more than zero, so say, 100, there will be 6005 -", "answer": " 90"}

Red horseshoe magnetic cost $3. Now that we have this price, we are going to subtract that from the cost of the entire stuffed animals. To do this we need to create a total cost of the stuffed animals. So we are going to add all of the prices of the two stuffed animal.  These 2 equal $6.00$. Now that we have this cost, we are going to determine a price for each item individually. To do so, we can first divide the total cost by the quantity of items. This would be two, since we have 2 stuffed animals. Now we have a cost of $3.00$. We can then subtract this from the total to get $0.00$.\n   So the red horseshoe magnet was $3.00$, and the total of the stuffed animals was $6.00$, and now that we have this total, we can use our method to determine the individual cost of each item.

On Wednesday Mack spent 60 additional minutes at his rate which is equivalent to 2 pages as well. Therefore, over the three days Mack has written 4 pages. The second constraint is the amount of time he took to write each page on each day. Starting from Monday and Tuesday, the rate is 1 page per every 30 minutes, which means Mack will spend 1/15 of the hour to write one page.

{"text": "1) This is a tricky math question. We should start with some basic rules: The total number of marbles in the box should be an exact multiple of the total number of green marbles. This is because in an initial calculation of the total number of marbles, counting any one of the marbles should not count as more than one marble because that individual marble is of a different color. 2)  Therefore, the only reasonable options would be to count the yellow marbles or some other multiple of the green marble number.\n3) We can eliminate option A.  Yellow marble number = 20% of green marble number.  This means for each green marble there should be 20% more yellow marbles. So we would have to take 20%*4+30%*3=17% of the overall number of green marbles in order to achieve 3 times more overall. Since we have 4 different types of marbles (yellow, green, red and blue) this means that there should be 3 times 17% (of the total number of marble).  We can eliminate option B. Again we can use the fact that there are 3 different marble types.  In order to get 3 times more each color should be represented 3 times in the box. With the 4 total marble colors this gives us that there should be 2*3*3=18 of each marble color.  But the question said that we added 20% of yellow marbles to the green marbles.  If we multiply the green marbles by 1.2 we get 120 = 2+2+2*0.2 = 4+2+0.4\n4) We can eliminate option D. This question says that there are 3 times more of the last marble color.  This gives us that there are 1 more red marble, 2 green, yellow and blue.  So we need 1 less green.  In this case we are missing 5 green marbles.  This means that every 6 marbles in the box only represent 4 different colors.  This contradicts our logic of finding a total of 4 different colors.\n5) We can eliminate option E.

{"text": "17%. By applying the rules of probability to the given statement, we can calculate the probability of catching either Zika virus or the malaria after getting bitten by a mosquito under two scenarios: with and without the vaccine.\n2. With the vaccine, the probability of getting infected with the Zika virus is 20%, while the probability of getting infested with malaria is 40%. Hence, the probability of getting either a Zika infection or a malaria infection when using the vaccine is 20% * 40% = 0.800.\n3. Without the vaccine, 50% of the mosqutoes are infested with malaria while 50% are infected with the Ziko virus. Hence, the probability of someone having either a Ziko infection or a malareinfection without the vaccine is given by the formula P(both) = P (malaria) * P (Zika), which can be simplified to 50% * 20% = 10%.\n4. Combining the above two probabilities, the probability of someone getting either a Ziko or a malarial infection without the vaccination is 10%, while if the person has the vaccine, it is 0.80.\n5. The total probability of getting either one or the other, that is the probability of being infected with Zika or malaria, is given by the formula, P (either) = 1 - (P (either) &#8251; P (no-either)) = 0.8 &#8252; 0.1 = 0.7.\n6. Thus, the probability of someone either getting infected with Zick or malaria is 0.7. However, if the person has the malarial vaccine, that probability reduces to 0.2.

{"text": "1) The question appears to be asking how many miles Tony will have driven when he is 50% done with his errands.\n2) The question only includes driving distances, but no time constraints, so the answer does not have to be precise.  The 50% answer could be accurate at 55.55 miles. \n3) This question can be broken down into sub questions. First we can figure out how many miles Tony will drive in a day.  For this part we are just looking for a whole number.\nTo get from home we have to travel 10 miles.  From that point we will take a turn from one main road to another, traveling 15 miles.  Then, back on the other road, travel 5 miles from that point.  To drive those 30 miles in the order stated, you must go right straight (not taking any detours), going 10, 15, 5 miles total.\nNext, we find out how that makes 50% of the total miles.\n\n4) The easiest way is to do a rough estimate.  The driving distance is 30 miles, and in order to drive 50% of that miles, the number is equal to 30/2.  Therefore the answer is 15 miles.\n5) There are multiple ways to get 15 miles. The first is to drive from home to one main road, turn north, and then travel 5 miles.  Then turn around, travel south, and then travel 10 miles to go back home.  This path will travel 15 miles. You could even decide to skip the 5 mile trip to the other side of the town.  You could choose to drive from home to the main road, and then turn north and travel 20 miles. Then turn around and drive south 10 miles. This method is more difficult since it involves the longer 20 miles at the end of the drive.\n\nWe could also take a different path where you travel 0 miles on the way out, turn, travel 10 miles and then end your trip with the other 15 miles.   Therefore you will have spent 25 miles.  The same idea can be applied going the opposite direction.\n6) In conclusion, there are 2 ways to end up with 15 miles traveled.", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "1. The question suggests that the bus was carrying 200 people back in forth between city A and city B, but the number of people each trip is calculated by what proportion.\n2. We know that 3/4 of the time the bus carried 200 people and the other 4/5 time, 200 + 3/4 = 250 people.\n3.'A: 600 B: 500 C: 100 D:150' are all total numbers of people carried.\n4. 'All of the above', option A, would be correct if it were 'All of the above - the total number of people carried to and fro is 600.' Since it is not, this option is wrong.\n5. To find number of people carried per trip, divide number of people by 2 for the first trip with remainder of 250/2 on the second trip. Since 250/1 = 255, the remainder is 5, so total number of people per trip = 255.\n6. From the given conditions, A = 200, and B = 500, so total number of passengers is 600.\nSo the final correct answer is 600\n\n### Test:\n\nInput:How many students will a 56 seat bus carry if the bus is filled to capacity with even distribution?\nOutput:1: 56.\n2: 5500.\n3: 28.\n4: 280.\n\nInput: What's the maximum number of seats on a bus that can carry as many people as an airplane?\nOutput:100.\n200.\n500.\n1000000.\n\nInput:\"If the passengers on the bus average 64 kg each how much load will the bus have?\" Question:\nOutput:1.

{"text": "1: For this question, the only essential information we need to solve it are Sara's name and the information about the computer stores; the answer may depend on her taste, but ultimately the answer is independent of it for this question.\n2:Sara's name appears only once, and the context of the question does not indicate if she is buying the item for herself or as a gift for someone else. \n3:There is no need for the reader to know about the sales tax because it does not affect the calculation of the price difference.\n4:The only other relevant information for us is the discount percentage for each store. We can eliminate some of the options by considering the two discounts in relation to each other. \n5:For each store, their price is listed with their discount. We know that the first computer store has a 6% discout, so we know that their price with the discount is $950. We can then subtract their listed price from this discounted price to get their unadvertised price. \n6:The second price listed is $920, but since it is an indifferent case, we can use their discount rate to make it a dollar less, and know that the unadvertised  price of the second store is $918. \n7:We only need to compare the $918 to the $950 to determine the answer.We know that the $918 is equal to or less than the $950, and that the first store has a bigger discount than the second store. \n8:Therefore, the correct answer is that the price difference is $34, or $950 - $918.\nSo the final answe is 'During the checkout, how much money did she save?' \n\nInput: The word \u2018mammal\u2019 is pronounced with two syllables: \u2018mam\u2019, which sounds like \u2018Mum\u2019, and \u2018mal\u2019, which sounds like the \u2018Mal\u2019 from Malala Yousafzai\u2019s surname.

The options can be narrowed down by the fact that it is a parking garage that is near Nora's residence and, there are 58 open spots and 4 stories tall.\n4. Since there are 100 spaces on each level, it is easy to realize that each level has 100 parking spots. Since each level on this four story parking garage has 100 spats plus additional spaces because the number of spats on each subsequent level differs from previous levels we can conclude that each level has either 198 or 200 open spots with the 200 number working better.

{"text": "1) This problem is about determining the amount of profits the buyer of Chang's apples will earn on his sweet apples.\n2) We can eliminate some options because of the problem's focus on the profit of Chang's sweet apples, or because of how much Chang earns.\n3) The word 'earns' implies that Chang is selling, so it is unlikely that the buyer is getting paid by Chang. \n4) The profit is $40, which means the total amount of money Chang has earned is greater than or equal to $40. \n5) The profit is calculated only for the sweet apples. If this were not the case, the profit would be less than $40 and the total profit would include all apples sold, regardless of what the apples are.\n6) The cost for the sweet apples is $0.5 per apple, so profit is calculated as $40 - $0.5 = $39.50.\n7) We know Chang makes the most profit on the apples, since the sells them for $0.1 per sale.\n8) This means that there are 40/0.1 = 400 sweet apples. The other 1/4 are sour apples. \n9) The total profit would then be calculated as 400 * $0.5 = 2000.

{"text": "1) Since the question contains the information about the total number of pens bought (20 boxes), the total number of pens given away (40%) and number received from others (1/4), we can solve the question using those.\n2) As it stands, the question states that a total of 5 pens were left with one remaining box after giving 40% and 1/4 to friends and classmates respectively. However 'pens left for Lenny' will not necessarily mean that only these boxes remain. They might have more pens in one box or less of some of them.\n3) However, we can assume that these are the only remaining pens after giving them to others.\n4) In the given scenario, 20 boxes containing 5 pens each will give us 100 pens in total and we have given away 40% of them. But 1/4 is 25% less than that. Therefore the total number of pens should be 125 and we have 75 pens left for Lenny.\n5) We can then choose our options from D-H based on the given information.\n6) Option D states that there were 5 pens left in the remaining box, 1 of the remaining 9 remaining boxes and in the remaining 3 boxes.\n7) From these 12 remaining boxes however, only the 9 boxes left after giving away 25% are mentioned so option D can be eliminated from the options.\n8) Option E doesn't make sense because there were 20 boxes initially and 125 pens had to be distributed from there.\n9) Option F states that one box and 6 boxes were left.

Choices: 1. using a ruler when writing 2. using a special type of paper 3. practicing 4. using a fountain pen 5. getting a grip on the pencil's body with a whole hand\nOutput: 1) The correct answer here is choice  'using a ruler'. The author clearly recommends that the user 'use the space around the body of the pencil between the fingers and thumb to write'. He states in the next sentence \"use as much of the writing surface as you possibly can\". This suggests that the hand must use a space next to the pencil. This can only be achieved by using a ruler. 2) The correct answer here choice 'using a special type of paper' is also suggested by the author, when he states that, 'there's a difference in the amount of pressure you are putting down with a soft graphite-type lead pencil on a hard paper compared to a plastic pencil and special paper'. Using a special type of paper is the correct choice between the choices. 3) The correct answer is 'using a fountain pen'. It is suggested by the author when he says 'you can hold a fountain pen with a light grip on the lower two thirds of the pen (not splayed wide), and you can use enough force to get a clean, dark line'. The author then goes on to say \"This technique of using enough pressure is called \"pressing and lifting\"' which means that when you press down on the pen you will exert enough pressure to create a dark line on the paper. This would definitely be the case with fountain pen. Not with ruler or plastic pencil.\n4) The correct answer choice is 'practicing'. The author states that 'if you're having problems with your handwriting, it will improve a lot with frequent use'. 5) The correct choice here is 'getting a grip on the body of the penncil'. The author states that one should not have a hand on the body of the pen. This implies that only one hand should be used to write, using enough force.

The next day Mrs. Lee gave Lacy two apples and one banana.

We can eliminate this because we have already established in the statement above the they did not count as bananas.\n4) It is still possible the day before, that they got more apples than banana, which is a possibility but is not stated in the problem. Therefore, the only answer choices left are either she did or she didn't for that day.\n5) Looking at the final day of apples, it is clear there was no change to the total because she got 2 more but also got one apple less. Thus there is no difference between the number of apples she started and the amount she still left with. Therefore, the only thing to consider is the banana, which is equivalent if she only received one instead of two, thus she did get more bananas than apples on that day.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is A: She Did.\n\n### Task: Please complete the following instructions:\n\nInput: 1: 20 boys want to get to school.

Santino has 5 papayas from each tree, for a total of 20 papayas. \n4) Finally, we find the total by simply adding 20 mangos and 20 papayae together to get 40.\n5) So the total amount of fruits that Santino has is 40; 20 mangos + 20 papaya = 40 total fruits.

It has existed since September 28, 1889 which is a Thursday.\n2. We also know that the Eiffel tower is about 324 metres (1063 feet) tall. \n3. Thus, it is important to note that the question is asking about the opening year of the Parisian symbol.\n4. From this, we will first rule out A: 1899, B: 1807 and E: 1808 as the year can not fall after the tower's inception date, nor before the day of the week.\n5. Furthermore, from this, we can eliminate D: 1890 since since we know the tower was inaugurated on September 1889, and it falls on a Thursday, the year 1890 would make the tower open on a Friday.\n6. Option C: 1882 is an option because the Eiffel Tower can not be opened before its opening year to its opening day; however, this is not supported", "answer": " 28"}

{"text": "1) Since we have 110 an ants in Stephen's ant farm, we can eliminate'more than 120'. Since Stephen knows he has 50 workers, a good estimate would be to round his number down to the nearest 100 ants, making our rounding 100 (112 to 110). Since we rounded down, half of the ants is actually 55. \n2) Since there are 55 worker ants, there should be at least 28 female worker ants.\n3) Since there are 110 an ant farm, we can also choose to calculate based on percentages. 20/100 of 55 is 11. So this tells us that even in this percentile, there is 11.33 female worker ants in this particular ant farm. So when we divide this by 10, we should have 1.1 female worker ants in the ant farm. \n4) So now we have calculated that there should be at least a 28 female worker in the ant farm, and at least 1.1 of them should be female worker. Given Stephen's ant farm contains 110 an average, Stephen should, on average, have at least 0.019 of his ants be female worker.\nSo the final answers is 0.018 female worker ants\n\nInput: The dog was left alone.

{"text": "Lydia lives in a very rural place where access to a big store with watering-equipment is limited. She needs to deal with such challenges as her pool losing 0.1 Gal per minute and she can only fill it from 60 Gallons.\n1. The question talks about a very big pool but as to why Ldyia still has to fill it. It is most likely because of the 0.1 Gall which is 10% of the pool.\n2. To fill this pool, with a hose she can fill 1.6 Gall at the same time; the total quantity of water would be 160 Gal (1.6 Gal min). The problem is that the pool loses 10% of its quantity. Thus, the total water needed will be 160 + 160*0.1 = 176 Gallons.\n3. So after 1 hour, she will have filled 0.1 Gal of water and the pool will lose 3 (176 - 3.176) Gal. After two hours, there will be only 172 Gal left in the pool. The second step with the same time would mean that she fills the pool with 96 Gallons but the pool will lose 18 Gal more than in the first hour. This continues until all the pool has been filled; when the final hour comes, she actually doesn't need to fill anything.\n\nInput:What's the total area of these two right triangles?

{"text": "11\n\nTo answer the question, we'll first calculate the volume of the first ball.\n\nThe volume of the first ball is one-fourth the volume of the second ball. \nThe volume of the second ball is two-thirds the volume of the third ball.\n\nSolving these equations, we can find that the volume of the first and second balls are both:  \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) x \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet, and the volume of one-sixth of the third ball. Therefore the volume of each ball is \n   \\(\\frac{2}{72}\\).\n\nThe length of the ball in feet is 12 times its width, multiplied by one-third. Using our formula to calculate the volume we previously obtained, we can determine that the original ball was 2 feet long and 1 foot wide, \nand its new ball diameter is \\(\\frac{20}{36}\\), which is 0.556 ft. So the length is 5.56 ft.\n\nThe original and new ball diameters are \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), so the difference in diameter is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), and the difference in radius is \\(\\frac{3r}{4}\\). We can apply Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the radius:  \\(r^{2}=144=9+\\frac{3^{2}}{4}\\).\n\nSo the radius is 7 inches and the diameter is 14.72 inches. We use the length and width formula to calculate the area of the original ball. As calculated before we have the length in feet and the width in inches. So, the area is \\(14.72 x 14.73\\), which is 202.8055.\n\nSo, the original ball, half the size of the current one, had a volume of 88.30047 inches. To answer the question, we need to divide 202.68055 inches by 88.3 inches to obtain the answer: \n   \\(\\frac{\\frac{12}{7}}{\\frac{88}{2}}\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) which in base-10 is roughly 0.166 or 16.6%.", "answer": " 18"}

This would be true if he is not attending school and can dedicate 6 hours every day for 6 years of practice to become a piano expert.\nSo the final Answer is 30,396 hours\n\nInput: The new math teacher has an odd number for her roll call number. She is assigned class room number 13. The numbers on her clock face her clock face are as follows: 1,12,2,3,5,6,7,8.  The correct time for her is when?\nOutput: 6: As the new teacher, her roll call number must be assigned an odd roll call number. Therefore her roll call number would be 1,3,5 or 7.\n7: Her clock shows the time as between 1-5, which are the first 5 hours she has to work. So given that her first 5 classes are in between 1-5 on her clock. Given that her first 5 hours at work was 1-5 on the clock, the correct time is between 1-5.\nSo the final time is 1:5\n\nInput: What's the largest number for n so that in the multiplication table 1, 2, 4, 16, \u2026 4 * n = 1, 4 * (n + 1) = 4 * 2, 4 * (2 * n) = 4 * (n * 2", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "1. This is a type of question whereby the question is divided into segments and each segment requires some subtractions to calculate it.\n2. We first calculate the segment of car that is already in the gas tank already to find the amount of fuel needed to make this journey.\n3. This calculation uses addition which is the process of adding together units of measurement of the same type until the total result adds up to the unit of measurement of the entirety of the problem.\n4. Subtraction is the opposite of addition and is used in this case to remove units of measurement from the total in order to determine how many the total unit that is required for the journey.\n5. We can use the formula for distance with one unknown - s = s1 + s2 - s0, where s is the sum of the two distances of travel. The initial starting point is subtracted from total final point.\n6.The unit of gas is gallons, thus divide the value of miles by 0.75, which is the amount of miles in a gallon. The units of measurement are now converted to miles using this unit.\n7. The amount of gallons needed is not equal to the total amount of fuel needed because we have calculated the fuel in the gas tank.\n8. We can use addition again to calculate the total amount of gallons needed to travel to the location of interest.\n9. We can use division again to remove the fuel already in the tank and leave behind the amount of fuel needed for this journey.\n\nOutput: 10.The final answer is 4 gallons, which is the answer the teacher wants.\n\n\n\n**Note**: The answers shown are in the range of 1-4 so the probability of random guessing is low.\n\n### Instruction:  Run the code and check to see if you got the answer.", "answer": " 52"}

To solve the problem of finding the age of the forth child, we can assume the following: 'Their birthdays were 15 years ago' -> (Year 0 of birthdays = Year 15) & 'Their third childs third birthday occurred two years prior to their fourth childs birthday' -> (Year 12 = Year 14 = Birthday of their third child). Hence, the last child was born before the 'twelve' as per the clue. \n4) To further confirm the age of the forth chid, we can calculate the number of years from birthday to birthday and subtract it from their birthday to birthday:\nYear 14 (Birthday of forth child): Birthday of second child -> 14 - 12 = 2  (2 - 1 = 1)\nYear 13 (Birthday of fifth child) = Birthday of first child -> 13 - 15 = -2 (2 - 1)\nYear -2 (Birthday of sixth child): Birthday first child -> 15 - 15 = 0\nYear 15 (Birthday of seventh child) - The first child: Birthday of forth child -> 15+2=17 -> (15 - 2 = 13 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 -> (7-1 = 6))\nHence,the answer is Year 6", "answer": " 8"}

With this information, it is pretty clear that they don't drink coffee powder, they drink CUP of COFFEE. 'How many days can this coffee last Angie' is clearly expressed by how many cups of coffee she can drink. Now we can simply multiply 3 by 40 (40 times the number of cups she can drink/day), and we get the number 120 cups of coffee she has. Next, we could subtract 120 cupped of coffee that Angie brewed up from 3 lbs of coffee she brought home. In this case, 2.7 lbs. will left.

There are two main reasons for that intuition. The first is the word *is*. The presence of the word 'is' in a sentence suggests a noun that is being described. *It's height* suggests it's a length that the *is* refers to, as it says 'height'. If the sentence were talking about a box, for example, the height would be a cross-section (the distance from the bottom of the box to the top) of that box where as the width would be the side length (the distance across the top of the box and the side). The second is the use of the word 'four times* which suggests a multiplication expression where 4* is needed to provide the factor which is in fact 4. *2 times** is used in a situation where 2* is needed and *3 times* is used in a situation involving 3*. However, the phrase *4 times greater than* could also be used if the multiplier was 4. The phrase *twice the width** doesn't fit because *width* is already known to involve the measure of a length, so it is not meaningful to describe it as *twice the width*. So, *twice twice* would not make any sense. So, knowing that the word '4-in-1' is related to a four-section rectangular unit (i.e., it is a combination of four different items which have 1) means that *the height* is a measure of length and *200 pages** are a measure of *the 4-section unit*. This indicates that the 4-section unit is a rectangular shape which results in a height that is the", "answer": " 1000"}

We already know that the 900 mL of water is equivalent to 30 mL of liquid per gram of charcoal.\n3. This tells us that for every 30ml, there is an equivalent of 1 g of charcoal and for 900ml we have an equivalent of 3 grams. (3*30=90ml)\n4. At this point we can find the answer by plugging in some information (giving us actual values for the given information).\n5. We can see that 30ml is a gram of charcoal (3-grams), then if we multiply that by 7 (which is equal to the 7 grams in a milliliter of water) we get 210 grams.\n6. This tells us that we need to add 210 grs (1+190) gr of charcoal (2+190) or 290 grs of charcoal to the batch. (210 + 900)\n7. So the final answer is 7+900 or 900+ 900 = 1800ml.\nSo the final conclusion is that if Jason adds 900ml, he would add 1800 grams of charcolet to the batch.\n\nInput: If the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 6 x a, then the area of the triangle is?

{"text": "1) First, we need to understand what this question is asking. We know there are 24 vehicles as mentioned in the question. We can say 24 = 16x3 + 12x2. This means that there are 16 motorcycles and 12 cars. Therefore the number of cars divided by 2 can give the number of spare tires.\n2) As we can see from the answer in Step 1, we should subtract the number of motorcycles instead of the cars because we want to calculate the number of spare ties. \n3) The formula can be written as 16/2 + 12/2 is 10/2 or 5.

{"text": "1) The first 4 lines read as:\nSuraya picked 15 apples.\nCaleb picked 5 fewer apples.\nIf Kayla picked 35 apples, how many apples more \ndid Suraya pick than Kay.\nKay picked 18 apples more than Cael.\n\nAfter this information we can see that the given information can be represented in a table \napplesPicked by SurayaCaleb Kayla\n555544101211131412111865\n\n2) We can solve the problem using the system of equatinos shown above. To do this, we will subtract the '5 fewer apples' from Suraya's total and then subtract the '5 apples less than Caleb' from Kayla's total (Kayla's total being 35).\nSubtracting the extra apples from Suraya is Caleb's total, we can use the expression 15+12-5 = 22 as Suraya's total apples picked.\nWe can subtract the 5 less apples from Caleb's pick and use the expression 5+20-5=17 apples.\nTo determine Kayla's total apples, we add 12 to 35 which gives us 57 apples in Kayla's total\n\nUsing the equatino system above, the total apples picked are as follows:\nSuraya -22 apples Caleb-17 apples Kayla -17 apples\n\nNow we will subtract Kayla's total from Suraya's, which gives us the following:\nSuraya -17 apples -17 apples = 1\n\nNow we take the surplus 21 apples and subbtract these from Caleb (the only other total that was subtracted from Suraya), which will tell us how many more apples Caleb picked, if any.\nSo Caleb picked:\nCaleb +12 apples -21 apples = -9 apples\n\nWe then multiply the answer (-9) by 12\nwhich gives us -(-9)(12)= -108", "answer": " 7"}

The first number of Judges need to be '40'.\n2) We then ask the following question to determine the number of Judges that are over the age of 30: '10% of Judges are under the age 30'.  Divide 10% (by 100) and write the answer over 40:\n40/100 = 0.4 (which can be rounded up to 1).  Therefore there are 10 over 30 Judges.\n3) The next question is '60% of Judges (are) 30-51 years old'. To determine the number of Judged that are in this age group we ask, '60% (of 40 Judges) are 30-151 years old' Divide 60% (by 40) and write the results over 40, you will get 0.6 (which can be rounded to 1) therefore there are 20 Judges in age group (30-315).\n4) The next question is'The rest of Judges (are over 50 years)'. We can write the statement like this: 'The 30 and above Judges are over 30 years of age.'. We will ask 'The rest of 30 and over Judges (are over) 50 years old'. To determine this write the number '30+ over' divided by 30 and the rest will be over 50 years. Divide 30+ (by 30 and write the answer over the Judges). That answer is 1, which would be rounded up to 2.

Let's assume each eraser will cost $0.75.\n3. Each box has 24 erasables in it and every eraser costs $0.75 in total, therefore the cost of each box is the sum of those quantities, namely [($0.75)*24] which equals $18. For some reason though, the question is asking us to work with the units and not the value themselves.\n4.

This indicates that it is a rectangular shape, meaning that the whole structure must be either wider than it is tall, or longer than it is tall.\n2. To figure out the dimensions of Libby's igbo, we can subtract two numbers. 10 is Libby's number of rows, while 4 is the number of snow bricks per row times two to get the first dimension. So the first dimension (the width) of the igbo is 8.0 + 4 = 12.0. Similarly, the second dimension (the height) of Libby's 10-row igloo is 4.0 + 4.0 +2.0 = 10.0\n3. To calculate how many snow bricks Libby used to build her igloo, we need to multiply the number of rows (10) by the snow brick total at the half-way point (12). We have 10 x 12 = 120.

The Christmas presents are not specified in the problem, but it is implied to be equal to or greater than the amount of presents Santana has to buy in the second part of the year. This means it is necessary to evaluate the present count for each brother since Santana has to purchase presents for every brother in the first half of March and November, and in the second half of December.\n3) Santana has 7 brothers, of whom it is stated she always buys each of them a birthday present, and another 2 who are born in December, which implies they get a Christmas present, making a total of 9 presents she has to purchase. There are 2 birthdays in the second half of March, implying Santana has to buy 2 presents, and 2 birthdays in Novembor, which implies she has to buy 3 presents, implicating a total of 5 presents she has to buy for February and March.\n4) The total amount of presents between February and March is 7 + 2 + 2, which is 12.

{"text": "Choices:  A: 3 minutes  B: 30 minutes  C: 4 minutes  D: 45 minutes  E: 12 minutes\nOutput:Firstly, we need to determine how many hours Tina has left for doing her assignment before she\u2019s done with dinner.\n1. If we multiply 5 \u2013 3:00 with 45, the answer will be 9:45 hours, so we can use this number to calculate time.\n2. Because Tina knows her assignment would usually take 10 minutes only, we can subtract the 10 minutes from the 9:45, so answer would be 9:35 if Tina knows her assignment\u2019s time.\n3.

{"text": "1) The questions state that Michelangelo has 2 ceilings to paint, so when he adds the amount he pained this week and the amount he has left to paint after next weeks progress, we can use a fraction as an answer.\n2) The total amount of ceilings Michelangelo has to paint, 28 + 2 ceilings, is the denominator. Since the amount of ceilings that Michelangeo will paint next week must be a non negative number since he is decreasing the mount the amount, we know that there will be fewer ceilings pained that week.\n3) The fraction that Michelangelo paints next week is 1/4 of (the total number of ceilings)\n4) We can write this number in a different form as 1/4.

Choices: A: -4 and -8 B: 4 and -4 C: -8 and -8 D: -8 and 8 E: 4 and 8\nOutput: The question says 'the sum of three fractions... is zero'. The fractions can be of any denominator, so fraction with denominator 3 can be used to represent zero. Fractions with denominators bigger than 1 can not be negative because they can't be divided by zero. Fraction with denominator 4 can be used to represent fraction with denominator 12. Fraction with denominators bigger than two can be written as integer, and so fractions with denominator 9 will represent fractions with denominator bigger than 1. These will be our answers.\n1) Choices A and C can never make zero because denominators are bigger than one.\n2) Let's take a look at the equation with choice B: 4 - (-4) + 4 = 8.

{"text": "1) The answer to this question will be based on how many songs are in the repertoire of the school band and the amount of songs they have played thus far in multiple sets.\n2) Since the band has played 5 songs in the first set, 7 songs in the second set, and 2 for their encore, and the band will be on stage for the full fourth set, we know that the number of songs is an average, or total, based on the number of plays they have had thus far.\n3) Therefore, the question can be simplified to \"If we knew how many songs were in the band's repertoire, but only a portion of the songs have been played yet, how many is the band likely to play on average in the rest of the sets?\"\n4) In these sets, each one represents a round of songs that the band plays. If the band has planned 4 rounds of playing, or sets, but they don't know before hand which specific songs they will play, how many songs in the repertoire can we expect on average?\n5) The answer to this is that they expect to play half the songs, based on their current performance. This is because a fourth of the songs have not been played, and half were played, so the average is half the total.\n6) We don't need to consider the encore, since it is two extra songs separate from the 4 sets, so two songs out of 30 can be added to the four sets and is unrelated to the average number of songs the band will play in all of the sets.\n7) The average song expected to be played in all rounds based on the knowledge of songs and the number of songs played is: (30/2) + 4 or (30/2 + 4). Or 15 + 4 or 19 on average for a total of 19.\nSo the final conclusion is the band plays 19 songs in a total of four performances, including the encore,\n\nInput: You have $90.00, and you spend $1.50 to get 3 ounces of flour, $.75 for a pound of sugar, $.95 for some cream, $.50 for some chocolate, and the rest on postage for a candy recipe.\nOutput: 1: The first part", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": "1: Tanika sold 72 boxes of crackers in two days.\n2: At first glance, it seems that Tanika's total sales double on Sunday because she sold 50 percent more boxes on that day. However, if we think in terms of percentages of total, this is clear not the case.\n3: On Saturday, 50 percent (100% *.50) of total sales = 30 boxes were sold.\n4: On Sunday, 100 percent of sales from Saturday -- which is the part of sales that the question asks about -- were sold, meaning that 50 percent of all sales, or 36 boxes, were sold on Sunday.\n5: Total number of boxes = 36 + 30 = 66\n6: We can confirm this number by adding the two days together: 60 + 66 = 126 \n7: Therefore, Tanika sold 126 boxes of crackers over two days. \n\nInput: On the first day, they lost 5.5 pounds of lumber.

Choices: A: 77.75 pounds B: 76.25 pounds C: 75.5 pounds D: 75 pounds E: 74.75 pounds\nOutput:1: If we look at the question objectively, not at the possible answers, we see that on the second day, the gain in lumber was 3.25 per hour. This doesn't mean lumber was left over at the end of the day, only that at the end of the 'period' of one hour, there would be 3.25 more pounds of lumber at the beginning of the next hour. This is because the question does not give a time period, only that it was 3.2 pounds per hour gained.\n2: This means, if we use this in our calculation, that each day, the amount of lumber left over would be 'x' of the amount the day before, so at the start of each day there is less lumber than the day before: Day 1 ---> 5.5 pounds; Day 2 ---> (", "answer": " 150"}

We will answer this question using a logical argument like an argument diagram, where we draw out our assumptions and draw conclusions upon that.\nIf the youngest man who dies in the bus crash was Mr. Wong, it is impossible for Mr. Wong to be more than a hundred years old.\nWe can exclude this as an option since the question is asking for a difference between the ages of Mr. Wong and youngest man.\nWe will assume, if Mr. Wong was not the youngest man, that he would be at least an equal age as the youngest man who crashed in the bus, so we will consider this to be our second assumption.\n\nUsing the assumption that there is some sort of a yearly gap between Mr. Wong\u2019s age and the youngest man\u2019s age in bus\u2019 crash, We can create an argument by drawing a simple box for our assumption, and drawing lines connecting our assumption to different possible outcomes.\n\nThe first line would connect our assumption to the final outcome of less than 10 years, which would result in a negative difference between our ages.\n\n1.The second line would connect our assumption with positive difference of 10 or more than 100\n2. the third line would connect our assumption and positive difference of 1 to 9\n3.

{"text": "1. This qusion asks about the average lifespan of dogs and hamsters, fish and how their life expectancy is related.\n2. We assume these are annual estimates and can eliminate anything where the expected time is less than 1 year.\n3. 'Dog's live 4x longer than hamsters' indicates that 'haymster's are a baseline measure of 'low expected life expectancy'.\n\nSince 'dog' is said to live 4x longer, but 'hamster's are said to live 2.5x less than them means that overall, dog live '175%' times longer than hamsters do on average.\n\n4. 'Ruth's father says fish live 2 years longer':\n'2x' over '1.5x' tells us that fish live an average of 3.33x the life expectancy of hamsters.\n\n5. 'Fish live an average of 1.5x as long as dogs do' confirms we're looking at '1x' more than the hamsters live, telling us that the average life expectancy for fish is 1.5x the average hamsters' life expectancy.\n6. So, we can simplify: fish live on average '2.25x' the life expectancy of the average hamster.\n7. Putting it together: on average, dogs live 175% of the average life expectancy of hamster, therefore, we can solve, 'How long can a fish live:'\n- '1.5x a hamster's life expectancy for fish '1x the life expectancy for a dog'\n- '2x a hamster' = 2.5x\n- '1.75x a dog' = 4x\n\nPutting this in context: if dogs can live up to 15 years, then Hamsters can live uo to 1.5 years, fish can then live to be 35-40ish and dogs can live to be 10-12 years old.\n\nSo, the final answer is: 40ish years\n\n\nInput: What would be the first number if you subtracted 215 from 596?

{"text": "1. The sentence, \"'How long would it take her...\" implies the teacher's question is asking about finishing the entire book in one sitting, without considering breaks.\n2. A reasonable time to assume is that Grace will need some time during breaks to rest from reading without necessarily falling asleep, so to provide a more accurate reading speed estimate for Grace, we may need to take rest intervals into consideration.\n3. If we divide the amount of time reading by the amount of pages in a book, the estimated reading speed in the given problem would be 5 pages per minute.\n4. We can determine how long it would take her to finish a 250 page book with the estimated reading speed in minutes: 250 pages in 20 hours would be (5 pages per minute)(60 minutes) = 300 minutes\n5. Converting to hours, it would take her 5 hours to finish the book.\nSo the final question is: \"Grace can read a **200**-page book in **20** hours. How long would **it** take her to **finish** reading a **250**-page book?\"\nIn answer, the teacher asks: \"How long would it take Grace to finish reading a 300 page book at this constant rate?\"\nFor our answer, we will need to consider Grace's reading rest interval, so we'll assume (for simplicity) that Grace takes a 15 minute rest interval during breaks, and will rest 15 minutes for every 50 pages.\nSo to have Grace finish a 255 page book takes\n15 minutes per 50 pages * 195 pages * 15 minutes = 657.5 minutes = 10 hours and 47.5 minutes\nSo the final answer for \"Grace can read 200 pages in xx hours.

After the water supply is shut off, one litre of water escapes from the bathtub each minute (this is done for one minute, since we are told that it is the first minute).\n4. At the end of the first minute, the teacher wants to know how many litres of water are left in the bathtub, or the volume of water that remained in the bucket, which is called the residue tank volume.\n\n5. Since water leaked out a little and he closed off the water supply for a minute, we are trying to find out is the answer of the question: How many litres of water did he leave in the bathtub before the next time he can turn on the water supply again? \n6. The question asks how long it takes to fill the tub with the flow rate of the tap being 12 L/min (litres per minute). If the tub volume is 120 L and we assume a flow rate of water in and out is constant, it means the total tine it takes to fill the bathtub is calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume x Flow Rate = Time to Fill\n\n120/12 = x (120/180) x x = 30 m \n\nThe answer is 30 minutes.\n\nInput: 3-year-old child needs to have 1 tooth extracted.

{"text": "1) The goal in question is to determine how much money will be spent on food by Susan. We must be cognizant that there are 2 factors that determine this: the number of guests and the cost of the food.\n2) The number of guests is fixed by 30 at this party, and there are multiple questions in this problem that we will need to add together to determine the total expenses.\n3) We can see that there are two main factors that determine how much food must be purchased, the number of guests and cost of food. Therefore we want to determine the equation that gives the total cost in dollars as function of 2 variables, the number of guests N and the cost of single potatoes c. We may assume the salt doesn't increase cost since it is a smaller quantity. From the problem we can determine that the number of guests N must be multiplied by the number of potatoes k and multiplied with a variable c to get the total cost in dollars. The only variable not explicitly stated is c which is unknown by default.\n3) To find this unknown variable c, we use the equation to form the equation c*N = 30. We are given that salt is x teaspoons, which is only $2 (as stated before), and must divide both sides of the equation by x to get c = $1.11 per batch of potatoes.\n4) Therefore, total cost of food is 4*1.11*30 = $123.30\n5) Once the solution is found, one may then determine the total number of potatoes needed.

So one of the three could work 12, the other two 4 because one-third and two-thirds leaves six hours to be split between two equal partners.\n2) Then we can subtract half of one-third of 12 from 12 hours and come to 6; then the two other people worked 4 each so 4+4+6=14.\nSo the final answe is 14\n\nInput: A group of 24 students went to the movie theater and the ticket rate was $4.95 for adults and $3.75 for children.\nThe students got 24 tickets total and used exact change.\nIf there were three children tickets to each adult ticket,\nthen how much in total did they pay?\n\nOutput: To answer the question, we start by considering the options, all of which are given to us in the question. We can eliminate some of the options based on the information given to us, such as a statement that the students used exact change, which means they gave the cashier the exact amount required, which in this case would be $10.50 as there are 25 total tickets.\nThe answer is $10.5 for the question, since using 3 children tickets for every adult ticket, and 24 tickets in total, they would have paid $4.95 x 3 plus $3.75 x 24, which is $10.40, so we round it to $10.5 to get $10.5, correct.", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "1. The book in question is clearly the focus and we can ignore all other factors that might distract our reader.\n2. The question is asking us to determine how many pages will Tom be able to read in two hours if his speed increases by a factor of 1. His first hour of reading gives him a speed of 12 pages per hour. So in two hours, his speed will be  12 * 1 = 12 pages.\n3. To answer the question, we need to multiply 12 with 3, so his speed will become 12 * 3 = 36. Multiplying it with 2, we get 36 * 2 = 72 and Tom will read 72 pages in two hours.\n\n### Instruction:Solve problem 7.\n\nInput:Tom can read 120 pages in half an hour. How much time would he need to read 495 pages?\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about how much time Tom would need to read 4.5 * 10\u00b2 pages in half an hour (i.e.; one hour).\n2) Since Tom can read 1 * 10\u00b2 in half an hour we can just add 1.5 to it. \nSo Tom will need an additional half an hour i.e.; 3 hours to read the remaining 345 pages. \n\n### Instructions:Solve Problem 8.\n\nInput:The current temperature is -67.

If nobody won: 'B: 29 Pounds' would be the closest to 'A'. This makes 'B' the closest to zero but 'A' is obviously heaviest or least lightest so 'A' is the answer.\nChoices:  A: 99 PB: 27 C: 53 D: 14 E: 54\nOutput: 1). The problem indicates that the county fair is running a pumpkin competition to compare who can grow the largest pumpkin.\n2. There are two possible options for the heaviest pumpkin: 'A: 91 Pounds' and 'E: 53 Pounds'.\n3. However, if we consider 'B: 89 Pounds' we can see that this is less than 'A: 93 Pounds' and would win a competition. If no one won, the only other option would be 'C: 51 Pounds', less than 'A' but higher than the other options. Therefore 'B: 87 Pounds' would be considered to be the heaviest.\n4. The possible options for the lightest pumpkin are 'A: 28 Pounds' and if no one wins then 'E: 52 Pounds' would be equal to the lowest total. Since the other options are different than that, all of those are eliminated and only 'A' and 'E' are the possible answers.\n5.

{"text": "1) The goal of the question is to find out how long it will take Carla to cook a certain batch of waffles and three chicken-fried steaks. \n2) Therefore, all possible answers relate to time and the amount of waffles produced. \n3) Carla can cook a batchof waffles in 6 minutes, but cooking 3 steaks at the same time would take longer than 6 minutes due to the limited stove area required. So, we can eliminate choice A: '6 minutes or less'. \n4) Carla can cook chicken-fried steakes in 6 minutes individually. Therefore, Carla can cook 3 steaks at one time in 6 minutes if she prepares the steaks in a specific way, such as stacking them on top of each other. This is a logical option because Carla is known to cook chicken-friedsteaks individually that way, so she would not need to multiply the time to cook 3 chicken-fried steeks individually.

{"text": "1. Since the question states that the number of ants doubles each hour, we can assume that at any given hour, there is a doubling and one more is added to the total.\n2. It wouldn't make any sense if any ant that dies does not get replicated. If there is no replication it would just mean that at each half-hour all the ants die, then there will be no ants left in the jar by the next half-hour.\n3. We can choose one hour at a time to determine the number of ants for each hour without any contradiction and with each hour comes two new ants.\n4. This means that at the first hour, the number of annets must be 51 and there are 100 ants.\n5. At the second hour, the number must be 102, with 50 ants. \n6. At the third hour the number must be 202, with 100 annts.\n7. At the fourth hour the number must be  402, with 200 annts,\nIf we draw a simple tree over these events we can see that we keep adding two ants in each hour and each addition will take place after 30 minutes.\nAs we draw the tree we can calculate that at the end of 5 hours there will be 602 ants in the jars, which is the final answer.The final answer is A:602", "answer": " 1600"}

{"text": "1: Given that the villagers are unaware of the attack of vampires, the villagers' population of 300 people would gradually decrease to 280 after the first night of an attack.\n2: During the first night, the villagers' inhabitants would be decreased by 10% from 300 to 270.\n3: Assuming the population does not increase, it is reasonable to predict that the villagers' remaining inhabitants would be decreased to 285 after the first night of attacks, resulting in an overall 5% decrease.\n4: During the second night, the population would then decrease to 285 due the first night's attack (which already decreased the total population by 5%) resulting in a total of 10% decrease (since the population is still decreasing).

{"text": "1.) We know that Clark bought seven of the part in total.\n2). Since Clark bought seven parts, he was able to achieve a discount on each part. This implies that Clark's final cost for the parts was less than originally planned and he received a discount.\n3). Thus, we can determine the total amount of the discount, which was used for seven parts, by subtracting from 7 the product of the original amount, $80, by the discount ratio (7 parts = 1 discount).\n4). The total discount ratio (1) would be equal to $\\frac{7}{80}(80-439)=\\frac{7}{8}$\n5). Therefore, Clark received a discount of $80\\times\\frac{7}{8}=87.5\n6).

{"text": "1)  The first thing to do is to establish the question for Maia: \"How many requests will she have for work when she has 5 days' worth completed for her?\" This means there are always 5 days for which she can complete 6 requests.\n2) To answer this question, we must divide 6 by 5, giving us 1.2. If there are at least 2 or more open client requests, she simply has 1 and 2 requests left to complete.\n3) Since the question gives us a 50% chance that some client requests will remain on the sixth day of work, there will always be at least 1 (or more) requests to complete.\nSo the final question is that Maia has 1.2 requests remaining to work on after she has completed 5 days of work on 6 client requests for each day.", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "The answer is D) 24 daisies. \n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below\nIt's 2003 and you are a student at Harvard University. Due to a scheduling mistake you enrolled in an econometrics course which meets at the same time as Calculus. You already have a 3.75 GPA. You are really worried that taking this course will lower your GPA. You are pretty sure you can easily get a C in Calculus, but you are not so sure about your chances in the econometrics class.\n\nHow many hours are you expected to spend on econometrics during a typical week throughout the semester if (a) you have an average econometrics grade of B, and you have an average probability of getting B on an econometrics assignment, and (b) you have an average grade of B on an econometriacs assignment, and you have an above average chance of getting B on an EC assignment\nOutput: (a) 13.0753366   (b) 15.361555\n\n\n\nInput: The student has a high probability of getting a B in Econometrics and an average grade (~200?) if she gets a B. It's reasonable to assume that she spends a bit less time on econometrics than average each week. Hence, I can safely say that she spends 13.08 hours on it each week.\nHowever, each EC assignment is a bit harder than the average. \n\nThe student has a high chance of getting a B+ or A in Economics. I can assume that it's higher than 1/5 and lower than 1/4. \n\nTherefore, the expected number of B or higher grades the student is getting on a course will be approximately 13\\*0.6 + 0.1 + 15\\*0.6 = 14.65 hours spent on Economics.\n\n### Instructions: The last question on the test is a bonus.

It is not a commonly used medication to treat an infection and it's irrelevant that the patient's illness is a severe or minor.\n3) The correct answer is C. The quantity of medication given to patient is 25mcg, which needs to be treated as a gram which it is 0.00025g. It makes sense \n4) Because 25mcg of steroid medication can help heal a mild infection.\nSo the final correct answer is C:.00025 grams of 25 Mcg steroid\n\nInput: A baby in a tundra w", "answer": " 200"}
{"text": "The question makes it clear that the garden is split into two sections, one for fruits and one for vegetables. \n1. Based on the given information, we can eliminate options A, B, and F because they all refer to a whole fruit or whole garden.\n2. We are left with options C and D which allude to section slices. \n3. Since we know that 64 square feet is the total size of the garden, the garden will be divided into two equal sections that will each take up 32 square feet.  \n4. The fruit section is split into fourths which means it takes up one sixth (1/6 or 17.5%) of the garden.  If we add the vegetable section to the fruit section, we can see that we are left with one third (1/3 or 33.3%) section.\n5. 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/3.\n6. So, we can see that the fruit section takes up 1/3 of the garden. \n7. Similarly, we can subtract 1/3 of 32 from 33 to find out that the vegetable section takes up 10.33% of the garden.  We can then subtract this from the full garden size of 64 to find that the fruit section takes 23.67% and the vegetable section takes 0.47%, which adds to 24.14%.\n8. So, we can conclude that 24.1% of the garden will be taken by the fruit section (strawberries section) and 0.5% of the garden will left for the vegetables section.\nSo the final answers are C: 24.10%, and D: 0.50%\n\nInput:Alice took 25 days to reach the top of Mount Everest.

Option E is incorrect for a similar reason as D - the total number of wings are 64 and not at least 48.\n\n6. Option H is correct. We calculated 12 minutes as a result of the following formula: Number of minutes needed to eat 64 wing times 7 is 448, divided by 5 is 89.2, which rounds up to 90, or 12 more than the initial 50 minutes Alan took.

The implication is that the red and blue train take identical routes to get where they need to be. Their 'average speeds' are not important at this point, since the question is asking for the passage time. \n4) Once all the other information is taken into consideration 'The Question', this question is about two parallel trains which are moving on two parallel tracks.\n5) So we can eliminate options A, B, E and F because they do not provide relevant information regarding the two parallel tracks.", "answer": " 13"}

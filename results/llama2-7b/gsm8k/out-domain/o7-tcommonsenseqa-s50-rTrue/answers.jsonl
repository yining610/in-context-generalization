We want to know what type of math topic they do not like to study in.\n\n### Output:\n\nAuthor does not want to study algebra.\n\n### Explanation:\nSince the author does not like/wants to study math, we can conclude the author does not like studying algebra. Since geometry, statistics, and algebra do not come last in the passage they cannot be the correct answer. The author does not want the type of math the author does not like to study. We can cross out geometry algebra since geometry is not a type of algebra. We can cross out algebra geometry since that is not the author's concern. We can cross out F if we cross out E.\nAuthor does not want/like to study statistics algebra. \n### Explanating:\nThe author states that they do not like/want studying algebra. Since statistics algebra is not an equation where algebra can be found, algebra is not a part of this. Therefore, algebra is not of concern to the author and therefore is not something the author would like.\n### Explanering:\nWe want to know which one of the options stated in the passage they are worried about. If we know what they are worried about we know that it is not the answer they mean and also eliminate the answer. We do not want the type of algebra the author mentioned. We are eliminating anything including the type of algebra they mentioned. We do not want to study any type of thing that was mentioned. Therefore, the option the author is not worried about is D.

This will tell us how many miles one can travel in five hours, which is the key information given in the question.\n\nExample:\n\n    Consider, for example, the first three options:\n     1)\n    Convert 20 km to miles: 20 * 0.6213712 = 12.623 miles\n    Convert 250 km to miles: (250 * 0.8046) = 201.04 miles\n\n    Converting kilometres to miles:\n    km to miles: 100 = 0.62 miles\n    km to miles : 250 = 1.5 miles\n\n    We can see that, at 12.6 miles/h, it would take around 7 hours to drive 100 miles. At 1.5 miles/h, it could take you almost 8 hours to drive 250 miles. So for example, answer (5), which states that a person could reach 280 miles in five hours at 1.8 miles/h might well be, as the question states, \u201cunlikely\u201d: this means that 260 miles might be a better answer.\n         \n    The only solution left is option (5).\nAnswer: 5) 280 miles\n\nInput: A dog and a cat were playing.

Choices:  A. increase his profit B. increase customers C. keep it D. reduce costs E. reduce sales\nRationales:\n1. The question states: \"This bookshop has a lot customers coming in.\" This could indicate that customers are coming frequently to the same store and the owner knows their preferences and habits.\n2. He tries to profit more by finding out what customers want more and providing it in bulk.\n3. This type of profit increase comes from getting the same customers to spend more while they are at the shop, rather than increasing new customers.\n4. Increasing sales happens by bringing in more customers.\n5. The option'reduce costs' is not directly related to the bookshop owner having more profits. They don't have something in common.\n6. The option'reduce sales' is inaccurate as increasing sales is the opposite of decreasing sales. And, the option 'keep it' would only mean keeping things the way they are which would not lead to increasing profits.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is 'increase his profit'.\nAnswer: A. increase his profit\n\nInput: Which are the best words to use to get a man or woman to work together?

There may be more than one ratio that corresponds to this set-up.\n1. The correct answer must come from the options that are given.\n2. Any ratio with a number that is less than one, represents a buying power that is weaker than that of $1 USD.\n3. Therefore, option D with $1.3 does not meet the stipulation in the question and is ruled out as an appropriate answer.\n4. Option C has a ratio of 1.0 which would indicate that there is equivalent buying power, thus the amount of a US dollar is equal to a British Pound.\n5.

Choices:  a) chocolate cake; vanilla cake  b) vanilla cake; chocolate cake  c) mix chocolate and vanille cake to make a new type of cake d) mix chocolate with butter to make buttercream that tastes like chocolate e) use a chocolate sprinkle on top of the cake\nRationales: Let's start with options A and B, because they do not make sense, so they can be ruled out. \nIn Option 'C': You cannot mix chocolate and Vanilla cake to make a \"Newer, different kind of cake\", which defeats the question of the exercise, so this can be ruled out too.\nIn option 'D': It's incorrect because you cannot mix chocolate with Butter to make butter cream that \"Tastes like chocolat\".  This is not possible since the ingredients of butter and chocolate are different, so they're not substitutable (In cooking, 1 cup white butter or margarine should be replaced with 1 cup 2.5% cream or 2% whipping cream. If it\u2019s a recipe to make buttercreme, you cannot make this by substituting the ingredients used in the question).\nOption 'E' does not make much sense, so 'E' can be ruled out too since in this option you will not make cake but you'll  \"Put Chocolate Sprinkle on the cake\".\nTherefore, the answer is 'D', you simply use Chocolate Buttercream. \n(If you don't know the difference between  \"butter\" and \"buttercream\", you must do some research.

His spaghetti was going to be in a box shape like this:  Choices:  A circle B oval C square D triangle E cylinder\nRationales: The question asks about the shape of Ricky's spaghetti.\n1. The description of the spaghetti being in the shape of a circle, oval, square and triangle is not sufficient alone to answer the question completely.\n2. Therefore, we need to identify the spaghetti's shape using the context of the question and the available clues. A'shape like this' can be inferred to be another shape in addition to the ones already mentioned in the question.\n3. Consider the other available options:\n   Circle - Ricky is making spaghetti in the shape of a 'circle' according to the question.\n   Oval - Oval can be considered as an alternative shape for'shape like this'. Oval does not fit the context as spaghetti was not mentioned by name, only the form was. Oval is a different shape than the one mentioned by the question, therefore this is not the correct choice.\n   Square - Square can also be considered as a third alternative shape. Square is not consistent with the given context, and does not fit with the'shape like this' part. Therefore, square is not the correct choice among the given options.\n   Triangle - Triangle is the shape that fits the description of'shape like this' perfectly. In this way it is in alignment with the question, and thus can be considered as a potential choice.\n   Cylinder - Cylinder can be another potential choice to answer the question. The given context does not mention spaghetti, but is rather just talking about shapes. We can infer from this that another shape in addition to oval and triangle is given as a choice. Cylinder can be considered as a third potential shape of the answer.\n4. Thus, we must determine which option best answers the question while taking into account the given context:\n\nSquare and Circle are already given as the answer.\n\nTriangle is not the shape that was given.\n\nOnly Cylinder and Oval remain from the given choices.\n\nTherefore, we can decide that Oval is not the correct answer and the most suitable candidate for the choice among the given options at", "answer": " 476"}

To make a change / to cause a change in 5. To exchange something from one state to the other / to get a change in something / to get something that you can use instead\nRationales: The given question implies that the word 'lose' is often confused with the word 'lost', which means not being in possession of something, which is more akin to wasting. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer for this riddle should involve the word 'waste'.\n1. 'Loose' is the first word that comes to mind when we think about the English word 'lose', therefore it does not fit the given context and can be ruled out.\n2. 'To change' is a suitable candidate that works with all of the given words. It cannot be disproved, and can possibly be the correct answer. But 'To cause a change' can be disproved, as its primary function is to describe an action, not a result, and it doesn't mention that it'd cause a change in something.\n3. 'To exchange something' cannot be ruled out at this point, but it cannot be disproved either, so we will consider the other two answers further.\n4. 'To make a change' can be described as the same action but the direct opposite, which indicates that it is not the answer.\n5. 'To get something that you can u e instead' can describe the action of receiving something, but it cannot be a replacement for one thing or other, so it cannot be said to have 'cause a change in something'. Hence it cannot be the answer either.\n6. Let us continue our analysis further. 'To change with' is the phrase used to describe something changing in tandem with something else.

The question asks us for a sport that is great but inexpensive. Therefore, there must be other sports that provide more affordability and hence, it can be deemed as a better sport for youth.\n   B : Baseball - Baseball is a great sport, but it is not cheaper than other options and therefore doesn't fit the description of \"inexpensive\" in the given question.\n   C : Football - Likewise Football is a great sport, however, it does not fit the description of \"cheaper\" and hence cannot be deemed as a great sport for youth. \n   D : Volleyball - In contrast to the first option of \"Volleyball\", Volleyball is indeed a great sport but in a different way. Volleyball is a great indoor sport for youth which doesn't involve expensive equipment unlike football and baseball but it is much more challenging compared to all other options, including baseball, football, and badminton.\n   E : Badminton - Badminton is a cheap and affordable sport, as there is no equipment to buy. Additionally, it promotes teamwork and communication, which can help youth develop valuable skills.

The question asks which car part turns an engine's combustion engine into electrical energy.\n2. The combustion engine is the part that converts fuel into mechanical energy.\n3. But mechanical energy is required by a motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.\n4. Therefore, the correct choice must include the combustion engine and either the motor or brakes.\n5. The motor, however, is not the only type of engine in a car and usually isn't a part of a car to the most significant extent.\n6. Thus, it's likely that the correct answer contains either engine or brakes and not the motor.\n7. Brake is indeed an engine part but it's not the part that turns the combustion engine into electricity.\n8. Therefore we need to exclude A: Brakes, B: Engine, D: Electricity from the options because none of these parts turns the combustion into electricity.\n9. Motor can turn the engine into electricity but that isn\u2019t the only part of this process.\n10. Thus, there is a part of the engine that helps it turn into electricity and that\u2019s the combustion engine.\n11. Now that we know which part is the key player, we can easily move on to the rest of the options.\n12. The rest of the parts are already eliminated.\n13. So, let's begin by analyzing motor.\n14. Motor can be the key player if it's electricity that turns the engine into electricity. In that case, option E would be the right answer.\n15. However, we can see from the question that electricity is not the answer because it\u2019s not the part that transforms the energy of the electric motor into electrical energy of the internal combustion engine.

A question is asked if the carpet at the sports stadium is made out of grass.\n2. It's necessary to decide if this is a carpet made of artificial grass (TURF) or if it's a kind of carpet made out of wool yarns such as sheep wool.\n3. A yarn is a twisted strand of interlocked fibres often used in weaving and sewing, and it is not a type of natural grass.\n4. Similarly, synthetic materials don't consist of grass, rather they are a variety of polymers that serve as a substitute for grass. Therefore, we can reject option B: natural material and option C turf since both yarn and artificial turf cannot be defined as grass.\n5. Option D: wool is also not a type of grass since it's a natural fiber taken from sheep, not grass.\n6.

B: This is only true if you are a person who was born on December 26.  C: All of these statements are false.\nRationales: It should be done in a step-by-step manner.\n1. The first step is to eliminate all the answers that are obviously false.\n2. We should do this step until we can confidently say that the remaining answers are the correct ones.\n3.

Choices: \nA: exciting B: funny C: important D: amazing E: fascinating\nRationales: The introduction paragraph is an opening part of an essay or report.  It should be written informatively, briefly, and clearly.\n1. The word \"exciting\" doesn't convey that sense, as it is overly dramatic, which may distract from the main point of the written piece.\n2. The word \"funny\" can be used in an introduction, but it should be placed later in the paragraph or essay as it doesn't give the right feeling about the content of what is written.\n3. The word \"important\" only emphasizes that the matter is important and not what it actually is or does. Therefore, it doesn't serve as an adjective in an introduction paragraph.\n4. The word \"amazing\" is a very strong word and can also be used only if there is something outstanding in the introduction paragraph, which is not necessary.\n5. Thus, the word \"amazing\", although useful in some contexts, doesn't belong in an introduction paragraph since the word \"amazin\" doesn't describe something that should be emphasized in the introduction.\n6. Since all of the words have a similar meaning and only differ in intensity, word \"fascinating\" should not be used in the introduction paragraph, because it is generally an exaggerated word.\nAnswer: E Fascinating", "answer": " 32"}

Choices:  C: his nature A: your bedroom is bad B: you have a dog E: he needs to exercise C: you're married to your cat\nRationales: One would reasonably infer that a cat is incapable of sleeping with you because of the following:\n  1. Your cat does not sleep with you. This is a statement and is therefore true.\n  2. He's incapabe of this. This phrase is used to express the inability to do a certain thing (e.g. \"I am incapable of sleepwalking\") and is therefore a matter of fact or logic.\n  3. The reason his nature. In the context, the nature of the cat refers to its species, not its character.\n  4. Your bedroom is bad. Given that he doesn't sleep with me, I can assume that I have something against cats. Otherwise, it stands to reason that my bed would be made in such a way as to accommodate him.\n  5. You have a dog. Not a kitten, mind you.\n  6. He needs to exercise. This is an example of a logical inference, where we conclude that a cat needs more physical activity, given the evidence that it doesn't sleep in my bed.

Options Lives and travels are mentioned in the question. The sunset will be seen while travelling through the continents. Therefore, Europe is the best answer to the question, because it is not given in the question that the time of sunset needs to be seen by day or night. It could be both. So any continent, where the sunset could be seen any time of the day is acceptable in the context of the question. That does not include the option America because day and sunsets are not mentioned in the question, so therefore no continent fits better than Europe for the answer.

B: MILEY CYRUSS - This option is not possible in this scenario. For human beings to feel lighter by some things like a balloon or a giraffe means that they should have a negative weight. Since the word says \"lighter\", it means they should have positive weight. In this case, both A balloon and B Miley cyrus will not make the subject feel lighter. This is because they have negative weight.\n2. C: A BALLOON - If there is any option that fits this purpose it is this. A balloon is a thing that is lighter, therefore, it fits the requirements.\n3. D: A GIRAFFE - This also would not be a good option since it is lighter already. The reason for the question is for a person to feel lighter. Therefore, the subject we are talking about should have negative weight.\n4. E: A DOG - A dog is a thing that will not make the subject lighter. This is why you need to eliminate this option.\n5. F: A HOUSE - A house is no way an option to make a person feel lighter. A house has its weight. This is an example of a \"weight\". This will not serve the purpose of the question.\n6. G: A SKYDIVE - Sky diving is a dangerous thing. It is just for people to try it once. However, if you do it continuously, it will make you lose weight since you are losing your muscles when doing it. Nevertheless, the idea of the question is to make a person feel like he is lighter. And the person is heavier than the sky dive itself then why would it make him feel lighter?\n7.

Choices: 1. Fall season 2. Winter season 3. Spring season 4. Summer season 5. The holiday season\nRationales: As we know, there are four seasons in a year: summer, winter, fall or autumn, and spring. That means a holiday can be described as a season. The options are: fall, winter, spring, or summer.

The question asks for the definition or meaning of the word 'dish'.\n2. It's important to start with the word itself by taking into account its spelling - 'd-i-s-h'.\n3. The letter 'i' in 'dish' represents a long vowel, which means that the vowel can be sounded out (for example, by singing the vowel sound with a 'i' at the end of 'dish').\n4. So, when we sing the pronounciation the 'i' could represent in 'dish', it can sound like: 'i' like the first letter in the word that starts with 'k'.\n5. In sum, by this analysis we can identify that 'kit' is the sound that the vowel in 'dish' makes.\n6. As a result, we conclude that option E: plate is the correct answer, as 'plate' is also spelt with a 'k' in the beginning.\nAnswer: E- Plate\n\nInput: What is the difference between a 3rd grade teacher, 5th grade teacher, and 7th grade teacher?

From each of these options, a specific interpretation of the meaning of the snake can be derived.\n4 a.

The given context talks about how different classes often require different approaches to assignments or projects. \n2. This means that some tasks might be more challenging than others.\n3. In the case of academic studies, one task might be more demanding than the other.\n4. The essay, while a challenging task to master, might be more accessible to students due to its familiarity. On the other hand, classic play or poetry requires students to tackle an unknown source, thus making it a more challenging task as it requires students to have a deeper understanding of the text and its themes.

All options are different choices of protein but chicken is the closest to being a dietary option because eggs are a great source of protein too.\n  2. Chocolate is the least fitting option because it's not a dietary choice.\n  3. Choice C states that turkey is a protein and option D mentions fish, both of which are proteins but don't follow the format of the question. Therefore, the answer choice of fish is incorrect.\n  4. Choice E doesn't mention eggs in the description.\n  5. Eggs are often used in recipes that promote a healthy diet for breakfast because they're a good source of protein. Option A, chicken, is another protein that fits the dietary requirements. Hence, the answer answer is A.\nAnswer: A:-Chicken\n\nInput: What does the statement prove about Aiden?

Choices:  a: someone who loves to take orders, b: someone who takes action when it is needed, c: someone who will be honest, d: someone who is a perfectionist, e: someone who sees the big picture\nRationales: After examining the quality described in the question, we can start by eliminating options that do not meet the criterion.\n1. Option a: Someone who loves to take order - In a leadership role, a good quality is for someone to have the wisdom and decision-making skills to provide direction despite the possibility of challenging and conflicting situations.\n2. Option b: Someone who takes action when it's needed - This can be interpreted as an unwise decision-making that is not in the organization's best interest.\n3. Option c: Someone who will be honest - This can be read as someone who isn't reliable because they tend to lie.\n4. Option d: Someone who is a perfectionism - In leadership, there cannot be perfection as there are so many different dimensions to consider.\n5. Option e: Someone who sees the big picture - In a leadership role this is more of a skill, one that takes time, effort, education and experience to learn and apply.\n6. Therefore based on the given information we can see that the correct answer is option B: Someone who takes actions when it's needed.\nAnswer: B: Someone who will take action when necessary\n\nInput: Where is the best place to learn the best methods of teaching?

Choices: \tA: arms, legs B: head, neck C: elbows, knees D: ears, eyes E ears and eyes\nRationales: Based on the context, we can infer that the author suggests that the baby's body parts cannot be changed, and other elements in the statement could be body parts that indeed can be changed. The options are therefore A: arms, legs; B: head, neck; C: elbows knees; D: ears, eyes; or E : ears and eyes.\nAnalyzing option A, arms and legs, would be possible changes to the baby's body. While option B, head and neck are two possible elements that can be changed in terms of appearance, however they cannot be changed in terms of functionality. The options include elbows, knee caps which could be changed in terms of function and appearance as well. The options C and D describe the actual elements the baby can't change, whereas option E describes the elements that could be changed. Therefore, option E, ears and eyes, is the most logical answer.\nAnswer: E : ears and eyes\n\nInput: Why does it cost more to book a hotel online than in person? Choices: 1.

Statement (a) is directly implied by the given statement (b) because the premise speaks about how much the oxygen depth changes over time which doesn't refer to a clear understanding of the total volume of fish in the ocean.\n2. Statement (d) is not directly implied by the premise (We do not know what' s under the Antarctic Ice shelf) as this does not refer to the depths of the ocean but rather to the features that lie underneath the shelf.\n3. Statement (e) is directly implied as the premise speaks of a lack of understanding about what lies under the Antarctic shelf, which directly means knowing what lies under the ice.\n4. Statement (c) is not directly compatible with the given premise (We do no know how many fish there in the ocean.) as the premise speak to the depth of temperatures of oceans which have nothing to do with the number of fish that are present in the ocean.\n5. Now that we have determined which statements are directly implied or not logically compatible with what\u2019s given, we can then proceed to statement (b) which states that we don\u2019t know the number of fish in the ocean, and thus is directly implied by what\u2019s given.

Choices: 1: left the room 2: argued 3: decided not to attend 4: sat down 5: sat in the floor\nRationales:  1. The first part of the passage refers to a situation where not enough chairs were available at a meeting, forcing some people to stand.\n2. As the people who didn't have a chair to sit down started standing up just to talk to the committee or answer questions, most probably they were just standing near the board, because they were not allowed to talk from their seats. To this end, the only option available for the first part that makes sense is: 4.\n  1. The second part of the passage does not directly answer the question and is irrelevant, leaving this choice undetermined.\n  2. The third part simply describes the people as \"seating themselves and talking\".\n  3. The fourth part simply describes the people who were not attending.\n3. According to both parts, there must have been people sitting next to each other with empty chairs nearby. If people were left for another time then they would have definitely sat down leaving plenty of chairs for the people attending next. However, the question asks how people were sitting & talking, not what they were doing. Hence, the answer must be: 4. \"Sat down\" as it is the only option that meets both the questions.\nAnswer: D\n\n### Question\nInput: What is a cure for COVID-19?

Choices: A: hood B: roof C: trunk D: windows\nRationales: One covers a car most frequently by its roof, hood, window, or trunk.  There isn\u2019t any evidence that the wording can be interpreted as referring to the number of times the automobile gets covered, since the word \u201cmost\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be read as meaning \u201coftenest.\u201d\nTherefore, the answer is D: windows. Choice A, hood, is covered more often than the roof. Choice B, roof, is covered more often that Choice C, trunk. The trunk isn\u2019t covered very often, as a passenger has to open the trunk door manually, with their hand. Thus, Choice D, windows, is certainly the part of a car that is covered most frequently.\nAnswer: D Windows\n\nInput: What would a person do if they had a pet dragon?

This could be a business, a charity, or even an event.\n\nComparing this with the options given in the question, we can eliminate the options \"A) person,\" \"B) customer,\" and \"C) buyer\". These options focus on consumption rather than support and do not align with the term \"patron.\"\n\n\"D) do\" is also incorrect, as the meaning of \"do\" refers to \"to be or seem to be.\" In this context,", "answer": " 1000"}

The given questions compare a car and a pet dog, with respect to their utility as a vehicle.\n2. As a vehicle, one can either drive the car to work, or ride on it, using it as a means of transportation.\n3. Similarly, a dog can either be a carrier or a rider, depending on who it travels with. And there are several factors that decide who is the owner and who is the 'cargo'.\n4. From the options, one can clearly see that the choice B: dog is better than a vehicle (car) is a correct option, as the sentence 'dog is a better vehicle to drive to work' implies that dogs make a better vehicle than cars.\n5. Also, the choice F: car and dog are equally good vehicles implies that we need to add both these choices together, to understand this question.\n6. Thereafter, we can use options D and G to eliminate the rest options\n7. The choices are now boiled down to two choices- Option C: a car is better than a dog to drive to work, which is implied in the statement'my car is better than a car or a dog to drive to to work' and Option H: one is better for security and dog is more efficient, implied in the statement where H says 'One is better for security while dog is more efficient'.\n8. Thus, the option C: my car is better than a pet dog is a better vehicle to take to work is the correct option.\n9.

Choices:  C: years B: seconds A: hours D: minutes E: hours\nRationales: In general, seconds are faster than years; one second is the equivalent to 1/60 of a minute and 1/365,25 of a day. While one year is the equivalent to 365.25 seconds, as it requires 365 days and 25 hours to make a full circle around the sun. So 1 year is equal to (365 days x 24 hours) + (25 hours x 24 hours, equal to 6048000 seconds) / (365.26 days x 1 day) = 6048 x 10, 971 x 10,000,000 / 365,24 = 1.85519103 times slower than 1 second.

An easy way to tackle this question is to look for a term that makes the Earth move based on what is specified in the question and compare it with all the mentioned options.\n4. For example, the option Force can be eliminated as the earth is not rotating quickly because of its force, and light can also be eliminated as it can make a thing move, but can't cause it to rotate.\n5. On the other hand, we know that the gravity of the Sun causes the Earth to rotate, so the answer must be Gravity.\nAnswer: Gravity\n\nInput: What instrument can make a beautiful musical sound?

So, by turning on the heat or turning up the air conditioner means that heater and air conditioner should be turned on. 4.

Know if you're moving C. Think differently D. Realize you're not moving E. Tickle yourself\nRationales: The answer is to A.  Move differently.\nIn a spell you normally cannot move; the simplest way an enchanted person can get away from a spell is to move. If they cannot move, then the spell has not affected him. The question asks what a person who is not moving in the spell does.\n1. C. Think differently, D. Realize you are not moving can all be done standing still, they are not actions that require movement. All those questions are answered by someone not physically moving not standing still.\n2. B. Know if you are moving is a contradiction in terms. How do you know you are moving if you cannot move? (To move, you would have to know that you are moving). \n3. E. Tickle your self in a spell, it will not affect anyone. Even this is a contradiction in terms since the effect of a spell is that you cannot do anything. To tickle yourself, you would have to first know you are being tickled.\n4. A. Move differently is the only one which requires someone to move. Therefore, the person can move, making he is not under a spell because moving is what he does. The correct answer is moving differently.\nAnswer: A.

To understand the question, a few basic terms of economic concepts must be understood.\n2. The question revolves around finding the correct answer to the statements related to the term \u201cwhat kind of job\u201d, which typically refers to a job that is specific and not necessarily related to different fields within the same career, while the question \u201chow much\u201d asks for a specific numerical answer and has varying degrees of possibility.\n3. Of the options for \u201cwhat kind of job\u201d:\n  A: Artist: is one where you create art, so it's a job that is specific to one particular field within the broader category of \u201cartist\u201d, so this is not the right answer.\n  B: how much money does an artist have? Is a question which cannot be answered by saying what \"kind of job\", because it's not a job, it's a question about how much money the answerer has, so this is not the correct answer.\n  C: how much does it cost to buy to live in the south: - this cannot be answered by saying \"what kind of job\" (as it's not a \"job\"), nor is it of the form \"how much\", which asks for numerical values. As such, it cannot be the answer.\n  D: How much do I need to borrow to buy the car? A question about borrowing money is not related to \"jobs\", and the answer is indeed numerical, so this is the answer.\n  E: How much is your credit: this is a question that asks for the answerer's credit score, which can be interpreted as a numerical value, so this is indeed the answer to the question \"how much\".\n  F: How much do I have to save in retirement: is a question of the form \"how is the answer\", which is the wording that matches the question posed \"what kind of job does the artist make?\", so this is also the correct answer.\nAnswer: F: How much do i have to save for retirement?", "answer": " 19"}

History (A) is not a great way to teach 'History' as it is 'history'.\nSecondly, by examining the other options we find that Science (B) is a very general term and does not specify exactly what kind of science is being taught, so it is not a great way.\nMath (C) is also a general term. It is not a way to teach history, even if it did not specify the subject.\nIn addition, 'literature' (E) is a genre, not a type of teaching.\nTherefore, the only answer that can work is B- Social Studies, because we know exactly what it will teach.

The focus is on developing writing skills.\n\n### Notes2\nGiven that we are attempting to answer questions that require inferring the answer by looking at evidence provided and using that to create an answer based on reasoning skills, there is a need for comprehension of texts, which includes making inferences as well as critical thinking skills to comprehend the meaning and structure of texts and their purposes.\n\n### Note3\nComprehension of texts requires being able to understand how to answer the questions as well as how to make inferences about the text. \n\n### Note4\nComprehending the question helps in answering as sometimes the question asks in a way that makes the answer obvious. For example, \"What does that mean?\" - What other ways could that be expressed?\n\n### Note5\nIn the text, the answer to the question is indicated by something that is stated or implied in the text and is called a clue.\n\n### Notice\nIn this book the focus is on comprehending the text and developing one\u2019s reasoning skills by using textual evidence to make inferences. \nThe questions are multiple choices, and the answer is a complete sentence that is correctly written and punctuated. \n\n## Notes\n## Notes2\nThe questions were all multiple choice with the answer written out in complete sentences.

To answer a question such as \"How might I measure the size of a big City if it is the same as a small town?\" we need to understand the context and the goal sought.\n2. In this scenario, the small town is likely to be significantly smaller than the large City.\n3. Considering this, one option is to simply reduce the size of the City by half.\n4. Another option is to multiply the City's size by 2 since this will double the size of the City.\n5. The other options are unlikely to produce a suitable result since they don't produce a more accurate measurement of a larger City.\n6.

Options B: Punishment and D: Insult do not make sense, as punishment or insult is not the best way to encourager.\n \n  3. Both praise and reward can encourage the listener to keep performing the activity asked, as it gives a sense of approval and positive acknowledgement. However, the combination of both reward and praise is more powerful. In contrast, option A: Reward is the least encouraging, as the listener does not receive credit for their efforts.\n  4. The last option E: Praise-and-Reward combines both praise and reward, which is the most effective way to encourage someone. A combination of positive reinforcement and rewards will motivate the listener to continue performing the desired activity, and it will ensure that they feel appreciated and confident.\n\nAnswer: E: praise-and-reward\n\nInput: What will you get when you combine a pigeon, a duckling, and a chicken?

It can only be determined if a choice can be considered false or not by making an assumption and checking the results against the original claim.\n  2. For each option, a claim needs to be made that can't be true if this particular option is selected. \n  3. Such claims may be about the content of the original passage, the context of the wording, or any relevant background information provided in the question itself (like a photo, drawing, or other representation).\n- The given options are:\n  1. \"A\"\n  2. \"B\"\n  3. \"C\"\n  4. \"D\"\n  5. \"E\"\n  6. \"F\"\n  7. \"G\"\n\nThe main issue with the options is that they all have a value of 7.\nHowever, it is possible to quickly eliminate some options from the equation as follows:\n\n- Eliminating \"A\"\n  - Let's assume the original passage is about a group of penguins, and that it will be marked false if we believe that bears can replace penguins.\n  - It can be checked:\n    - The passage was about penguins.\n    - Choice 'A' reads \"A bear cannot replace a penguin\".\n    - Therefore it's false.\n\n- Eliminate \"B\" & \"G\"\n  - Let\u2019s assume that the original passage was about apples and oranges.

She couldn't trust her judgment because of what? Choices: A: fear of failure. B: fear of criticism. C: lack of experience. D: no experience.  E: lack of knowledge.\nRationales: She was having trouble judging which apples to buy, and the options given suggest the reason for this.\n1. Fear of failure and lack of experience both indicate why you might not trust your judgment, but they don't mention why she doesn't trust her judgment. In contrast, she does trust her judgment to some extent as she was considering purchasing the apples.\n2. She doesn't feel confident enough to make the decision, which would be the most logical choice, as she lacks trust. Lack of knowledge might sound plausible, but there is a possibility that she still knows something about the apples and has just forgotten.\n3. Therefore, we will eliminate these choices and consider those that are still relevant.\n5. These options don't mention any reason given in the passage.\n6. Therefore, we eliminate these. Since one of the options given is that she doesn't know which applie she should buy, we will eliminate F: lack of experience and E: lack of knowledge as they aren't relevant anymore.\n7. From the remaining options, the only one that makes sense in context is C: lack of experience, indicating that she has never had enough experience to make this judgment.\n8.

The word could refer to a person, an animal or a thing.\n1. 'Bad' would not be applicable.\n2. 'Old' would be applicable, if we assume that bad would be used to describe a person.\n3. 'Rich' would not fit, since it is a person and not a noun modifying a noun (bad).\n4. 'Young' would fit, since the word was used by the narrator to describe certain folks and young would define individuals of their age, (12-16) in the description.\n5. 'Old'would perfectly modify the noun 'folks' in the description, which would indicate that the correct answer is C.\nAnswer: Old, because it's used to describe a person and 'old' makes the most sense.\n\nInput: Which color is not related to a flower?

It could also mean getting \u2018stuck in a box\u2019 as a reference to a type of limiting viewpoint. \n1. A pigeon usually can't think outside of the box of a pigeonhole.\n2. Therefore, A: think outside of the pigeon hole is incorrect because pigeons usually can't think out of the box of a drawer for pigeons.\n3. B: have two wings is also incorrect. Pigeons usually have just one wing that makes them unable to leave the box of a pidgeonhole.\n4. B: pigeonhole and C: think outside of a box are a contradiction to each other. Because pigeons are unable to think outside of boxes.\n5. D: Stuck in a box seems correct but is not explicitly stated in the passage.\nAnswer: D Stuck in a box.\n\nInput: What is the most beautiful sight a person in love can see?

Choices:  A. open and read B. throw  C. shred and recycle D. save for future E. donate\nRationales: A: Jackie will open and read the letter.  The letter will most likely contain information about the sender or something important to them that they want Jackie to know.  Choices that are not valid answers:  B: Do not throw it.  Even if it is \"junk and advertisements\", Jackie should keep an open mind.  Choices that require clarification about the specific meaning of \"foreign country\":  C: This choice could be valid in many ways.  Shredding and recycling a letter can be viewed as \"trashing\", since it is throwing it away.  However, it could also be viewed as taking recyclables that can then be converted into other useful items.  D: Saving it for the future could be referring to saving the letter as evidence of a dispute in the event that the sender has broken a contract.  It could also just refer to leaving it in a folder to read later at her convenience.  E: The question does not specify how much money Jackie makes, so this cannot be the reason for the choice of \"donate\" Choices that have valid reasons, but would be highly unlikely given the context of the question:  F: Jackie will likely not donate the letter or its contents, as this will most likely involve the loss of information that Jackie wants to have.

A legume is a type of plant that produces seeds that are edible and usually used as the main ingredient in a recipe. It covers a broad category of fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, and many other foods. 1. We can narrow the set of options by analyzing each one in terms of their likelihood to match a \u201clegume\u201d.\n2. We note that each of the options contains an element that most legumes are made from - rice, beans, and vegetables. 3. Therefore, D: sugar, hone, candy is not a legume as one of the elements it includes is sugar, which is not an ingredient typically found in legumes. 4. Cheese, eggs, flours also have elements that do not necessarily match a legume. 5. Honey (option B) also does not fit the definition of a legume since it is not produced by seeds. Juice (option C) is not produced by sewing. 6. Thus, based on the reasoning so far, option A: rice, beens, vegetables is a legitimate solution given that it encompasses elements that are commonly found in legumes.\nAnswer: A.

Based on this information, we can exclude all answers where it would be possible to charge people.\n1. Since a fundraising event can charge people who want to participate in it, so it's not possible.\n2. A sports event can charge for certain activities, so not possible.\n3. A social gatherings can potentially charge but it's uncommon, so not the best answer.\n4. A music event can charge for the actual performance and for additional events such as a post-performance afterparty, so it can't be the best answer.\n5. A movie viewings can charge for admission to see the movie. They can also have additional payments for food and snacks, so not the best fit.\nThe rest of the answers would need to indicate that the event is essentially for free.\n1. Social gathering are typically associated with a minimal or no monetary exchange, so it's the best fit.\n2. Music event are a large attraction, but not essential to pay for, so it's a good fit.\n3.

Other options like \u2018mutt and mix\u2019, \u2018long dog with short tail\u2019, and \u2018boxer\u2019, aren\u2019t necessarily used to call a specific breed of dog the way they are mentioned.\n6. Therefore, the only suitable answer is 'Boxer Dog'.\nAnswer: B. boxer dog\n\nInput: What did the doctor tell Jake about his blood pressure? Choices: A. High B. Low C. Average D. Normal E. Unruly\nRationales:\n1. The question asks what the doctor told Jake about his blood pressures.\n2. Since it is a given fact that Jake\u2019s blood pressure was not normal, the doctor would notify him of either of the following options, that it is high or low.\n3. The doctor would never tell Jake that his blood pressure is average since the condition he had indicated that his blood pressure is not in the normal range.\n4. The same goes for the doctor also telling the patient that the blood pressure is unruly. It\u2019s highly unlikely for the doctor to inform the patient about such a problem since it is already known by the doctor that Jake suffers the issue of high or low blood pressure.\n5. The options that can be eliminated by logical reasoning, is high, low, average, and unruly.\n6. The only sensible answer will be D. Normal, or E. Unruly.\nAnswer: Normal Unruly\n\nInput: Is there enough space for a garden in your backyard?   Choices: A. Yes B. No", "answer": " 1825"}

C: You can store documents on it.  D: Phones are really expensive.  E: They are smaller.\nRationales:\n\n1.\tThe question asks why people have multiple phones which can be answered by explaining that people may have multiple phones for various reasons.\n2.\tNow, let's analyse each answer and see if it matches the question statement (why people have more than one phones).\n3.\tAnswer A: \" There are not enough cell towers yet \". It is clear that if there were many cell towers, there would be no need for people to have multiple phones. This answer is therefore not the correct one.\n4.\tAnswer B: \"You can send pictures for free\". Again, if people can send pictures for free (not require multiple phones for this purpose), then there is no need for people to purchase multiple phones. So answer B doesn't satisfy the given question.\n5.\tAnswer C: \"You can store documents on it\". This answer is not relevant because people are generally interested in answering the question \"why do people have more than one cell phone\", but not \"why people store documents on their cell phones\". There is an underlying assumption here that people can and do store documents on their phones. Let's check this by seeing if answer D can be chosen \"Phones are really expensive\" This answer is wrong because most of the time phones are cheap, so this option is not the correct answer to the question.\n6.\tAnswer E: \" they are smaller\". This answer is wrong because smaller phones are less expensive than bigger phones. Smaller phones don't necessarily cost less and a cheap phone is generally not as small. So Answer E is also incorrect.\n7.\tThe question has no answers. The correct answer is None of the given answers satisfied the question statement.\nAnswer: D", "answer": " 60"}

Choices:  C: saying you love a movie  A: saying you like the weather B: saying you love a song D: saying you love the rain\nRationales: Underestimations are statements that convey less than the full truth. One common type of underestimation is when a person expresses disappointment about something that is actually good. Example: In a \nscene from the TV show \u201cFriends\u201d, Rachel explains that she is not excited about her new job. She was originally really excited to have a job, but in the episode, she reveals that she feels like her job is \"only an underground parking lot attendant\u201d, which is the opposite of what she hoped to achieve.   The show is popular and she is the star of the show, yet she underestimated her celebrity. Another example is a politician expressing disappointment about the economy. If the economy is doing well, this is an understatement. Overestimation is when a statement is true but more than it needs to be.\n\nAnswer: Answer: Understatement: A. saying you like a movie, for example, 'I really like Spider-Man 3'\n\nInput: Which word has three letters and three syllables?

'Greene' can be used as an alternate spelling of 'green'.\nThe opposite of a color is the color produced by the absence of that specific color.\nGiven this understanding, one can eliminate options 2 (red), 3 (blue) and 5 (orange), which are colors that exist, but the opposite of which produces light colors, while 'green' doesn't correspond to any light color.\nWe are left with options 1 (not green) and 4 (rainbow).\nWe will eliminate the former because the given word is its opposite, therefore it wouldn't be an appropriate choice for the answer.\nAs for option 4, the given word is not part of it, so it's irrelevant.\nTherefore, the most accurate choice to answer the question is option #4 (rainbow).

We need a tool that can make this kind of structure.\nB.  While hammers are useful for carving and shaping, they aren't ideal for creating structures that can be bent. Moreover, using only mallets to make the structure might be inefficient as they aren't as effective at making precise shapes.\nC.  Screws are mainly useful for holding objects together, and aren't typically used to create three dimensional structures that are flexible and can be bent.\nD.  Chisels are designed for creating flat surfaces, not for making structures that can be bent and flexible.\nE.  Mallets are useful for striking with a loud noise or to deliver a hard impact, but aren't intended for producing shapes that are flexible and can bend according to the needs of the structure.\nSo from all of the options the answer is \"B-Hammer\" because it is most suitable tool for creating a structure which needs to be bent.\n\nInput: Which of these tools is used to help students see mathematical concepts? Choices: A: ruler, B: computer, C: pencil, D: calculator, E: protractor\nRationales: The given passage is about helping students to see mathematical concepts, and the question asks for a tool that can help them do this. \nThe options given are all tools that can have some usage in mathematics, but will not help students who are unable to see mathematical concepts.\nRulers are used to measure length, but aren't necessarily helpful to students who are learning about mathematical concepts visually. Computers are typically used for programming, data entry, or software development, and would not assist students in gaining a better understanding of mathematical principles. Pencils are used for writing and drawing, but wouldn't necessarily help students see mathematical concepts. Calculators, while great at calculating numbers, are not helpful for visualizing mathematical concepts. Protractors can be helpful in geometry and other math fields", "answer": " 18"}

The question refers to the part of your brain that controls hunger.\n  2. The information given consists of:\n   a. Temporal - \"Temporal\" is used to describe a part of the temporal muscles in the eyes. This implies that it would be unlikely for hunger to be regulated by the temporal muscles of the eyes.\n   b. Lingual - \"Lingual\" is another term describing the portion of the tongue. This doesn't relate to hunger regulation, specifically, so it's not a valid answer.\n   c. Sellar - \"Sellar\" is defined to mean a portion of bone at the back of the eye socket. Again, this doesn't relate to the regulation of hunger.\n   d. Cerebellum - The \"Cerebellum\" is another word for the part of the brain that controls hunger, so this can be considered the correct answer.\n   e.

Let's start by eliminating any word that doesn't have two adjectives.\n2. Option 3 can't be a word that has two adjectives since Eight has only one adjective.\n3. Eight has two adjectives. However, we cannot consider it because it has a vowel in between. Also, if we say 'a word that consists of two vowel' we will get an infinite amount of words without letters 'A,E,' or 'I' (so as to get two consonants).\n4. Option 7 is also out as it doesn't have two consonants and has two vowels.\n5. Option 10 is also out for the same reason as 3.\n6. Therefore, option 4 is the only one that meets the requirements and is the correct answer.\nAnswer: 4: Four", "answer": " 26"}

The first thing we need to do is to eliminate each option in order. \n1. First, a snake is not really what would eat only plants in the prairies, so it can be eliminated. \n2. The cat does not eat only plants, it's more of a meat eating option, so it can be removed. \n3. A pony can eat only plants, but it is not located in the prairies. So it can be eliminated as well. \n4. The giraffe is not an animal that lives in the prairies so it can be chosen as the answer. \n5. Finally, only dogs eat meats, they are not plant eaters in the prairies and can be chosen too. \nRationales: b. The giraffe cannot be chosen and the dog cannot either because they are animals and so are the cat and the pony. This is why choice d can be removed.  The cat and the pony ate meat at some point, which was also the choice e. So the answer is d: Giraffe\nAnswer:\nd. Giraffe\n\nInput: What did Jake make for dinner?

Choices: A: a device emits radio waves that are measured and then the measurement is recorded. B: radio waves are applied to the object at a frequency determined by an operator. C: the object is put in water and then electricity is applied to make it move through sound waves. D: water is put in an object and then electrical signals are applied to make it make sound waves. D.\nRationales: It all boils down to the type of device that an ophthalmologists use.\n1. Firstly, an ophthalmology is a specialist of the eyes who provides patients with the medical and surgical care.\n2. Secondly, an ultrasound is a diagnostic imaging test that uses sound waves with frequencies that are higher than those audible to humans.\n3. Thirdly, a laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is an optical device which uses the phenomenon of stimulated emission, in which a photon acquires energy (light) from another photon.\n4. Lastly, an ophlamologist can use a knife (surgery) or a lens.\n\n5.

Considering the given information, we can infer that the woman is likely a little uneasy or even frustrated about the news of the new baby. This scenario is implying that the woman might likely voice her feelings by rejecting the idea of the baby being present at the dinner table as she goes into her room. Here are all the rationales behind our decision:1. The woman went into her room, implying that she is unhappy about the news.\n2. This is further supported by when she heard about the baby she became confused.\n3. Although the question says the woman would mention it to her husband, this scenario is implying that she might do so by denying the baby to be brought to the dinner table.\n4. This is further supported further through her question \"Is it a newborn?\" which seems to hint to the fact that she might not prefer to have the baby at the dinner.\n5. The fact that there's a sentence describing the woman's room further reinforces our answer choice as she might not likely prefer to have the baby around her.\n6.

Leaving the spot is a bit odd as the question is about the jacket not the location you are at. \nB. Wrapping one's feet around the body is not something that would keep you warm for long outside, especially if it's a super cold day. \nC. Using one's warm arms in the way described would mean that the person with the question wouldn't even have gloves or mittens on their hands if they have to extend their arms to the end of their chest/stomach to keep them warm, so this is unlikely.\nD. If it's cold outside then the warmest body part, typically, will be the head; thus one would be wearing a hat or something, which also contradicts the fact that the person needs to wrap themselves with their feet, meaning feet is the only body part that could be free. This means they are wearing boots, so the \"wrapping with your feet\" can't be the way to keep warm, thus the answer is, E.

A: relieved B: disappointed C: depressed D: exuberant E: excited\nRationales: To answer this question, we will start by understanding the context of being a famous athlete and the emotions associated with that.\nFor example, we may conclude that being a famous athlete might involve receiving a large crowd of admirers and supporters every time you attend an athletic event, making you feel excited about performing well.\n\nTo fully answer this question, we must consider whether we perform well or not.\nFor example, if you performed well, you may feel happy, relieved, or exuberant.\n\nOn the other hand, if you performed poorly, you may feel angry, disappointed, or depressed.\n\nWe will be using this information to eliminate options that aren't appropriate for a famous athlete's response to their athletic event.\n\nWe will start by eliminating the options that we cannot reasonably imagine being expressed by a famous athlete who has performed well.\nOption A (Relieved) is not a common reaction of a famous athlete who performed well.\nOption B (Disappointed) is also not a commonly reported emotion and also doesn't make sense as a reaction to a successful athletic event.\nOption C (Depressed) is something that we would not expect a famous athlete to say after an athletic event unless they performed poorly.\nOption E (excited) can be eliminated since we have already stated that we may assume that a famous athlete who performs well tends to feel happy or relieved.\n\nOption D (exuberant) is the only option that is left from the original six options and may be a common reaction of a professional athlete.\nOption D is used to describe a euphoric or joyful state of being.

The question is about sneeze, so the 3 things to look for are What (what does a snake snoeze into, i.e. what does a snake snieze, what does a snake do); When (when does the snake snoeize) or Where (where does the snake sneeize).\nWith those things in mind, the question is \"What does a snake do when it sneezes?\"\nWe find out that a snake sneezes when something is stuck in its face, and if it doesn't manage to remove the sneeze, it will eat it.\nWe must now look to the options:\n\n1.

The choices are: A: a movie B: shopping C: a play D: cleaning up Choices:  E: all of the above F: a picnic G: swimming H: flying a kite\nRationales:  1. In the given situation, the children are presented with a list of possible activities, and are tasked with selecting the one they want to engage in.\n2. The options given are a movie, shopping, a play, cleaning up, a picnic, swimming, and flying a kite.\n3. Considering this, the question asks us which of the listed choices is the best fit for the activity in question.\n4. In this case, there are four options that directly involve an activity, which implies their exclusion from this question.\n5. The activity in question is the one that involves children cleaning up, so we eliminate all other options.\n6. That would leave us to choose from two options: a movie and play.\n7. However, a play is very much an activity, so we cannot choose it.\n8. Now, when we consider the other option, a movie, we know that, for example, seeing a move alone at a cinema has an activity involved. In this way, it can be understood that a movie does involve an activity, and thus, we eliminate this option from our list as well.\n9. In other words, we are left with the choice G: swimming.\n10. 'Swimming' is an activity, not the activity we are seeking.\n11. Next, we eliminate the option H: flying a kites.\n12. That would leave us with one choice: 'All of the above'.\n13.

A football goal is on the defending side, so as per the rule which states that if someone shoots in the goal they score.\n5.

Choices:  X: After you tell someone you're hungry. Y: If you are hungry.  Z: After you ask for help. AA: If someone knows you're hungry\nRationales: This is about a situation in which we are likely to get some form of assistance.\n1. Considering the question and the given options, we see that the correct answer would be Y if you are hungry at the time.\n2. The correct answer would also be X if you tell someone else that you are hungry.\n3. If you decide to seek help and say AA: \"If someone knows you're [hungry],\" that person might take pity on you, but the help they provide does not seem to be a more likely outcome here, which makes Z an inferior choice to Y.\n4. Choice Y seems to be the correct answer since a situation in which someone is aware that you are hungry gives you an increased probability of getting help, especially when you are alone, and have no food or drink.\nAnswer: Y If You Are Hungry.\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd0d <strong>Input:</strong>  How might a person find someone in his/her locality to work together?

How will the student dress so he can be outstanding? Choices:  B: differently C: similarly D: same E: uniquely\nRationales:\n1. We can begin by noticing the sentence structure of the question, which is: 'A school requires students to wear ____. How will the student dress to be outstanding?'\n2. The question is, thus, asking for an alternative or action of the given sentence, which is: 'to be outstanding'.\n3. Option A: Wear _____ is not the correct verb tense, because it should be wore in the question and are to be outstanding. Because the question uses'requires', it should be the imperative tense. Therefore, we can eliminate this as an option and move to the rest of the answers.\n4. Option B: differently is not the correct answer because the given option implies that the student will do something different and not in the way the rest of the students do it.\n5. Option C: Similarly is also incorrect because the way students will be dressed will be like other students, but 'uniquely' would be a more suitable addition. The correct answer, therefore, is option E: Uniquely.\nAnswer: E : Uniquely.\n\nInput: Which of the following animals has a shell? Choices:  I. Crabs", "answer": " 40"}

The given context explains that we are to select a tool that can only be found in one country.\n  2. Consideration may only result in eliminating all the options from the remaining four.\n  3. The reason being, only two of the options mentioned in the passage can be found in more than one country; \"Scissors\" and \"Stapler\".\n  4. \"Flag\", however, cannot be found in any other country, making it the sole option left to determine as the tool that can be found in only one country.\n  5. For the same reason, \"Stapler\" cannot be the correct answer.\n  6. \"Nail clipper\" can certainly be found in more than two countries, meaning that it cannot be the correct answer here either.\n  7.

Since, one who is not part of a gang, is called a \u201cchump.\u201d The question is what is \u201cchop shop?\u201d and the phrase in a room called \"The Chop shop?\" means a place where the \u201cchomp\u201d goes. So the options are A, B, C, and E.\nRationales:\n1. The question ask us to find out what \"chopping\" is. Well there is a room called \"choppers\" where a group of students meets to discuss about their future career plans.\n2. So, we are looking for an organization where people gather to chat about their future career plans, so that matches with A.\n3. Another option is A gang or B gang was forming where in those people gather around to discuss about forming a gang or a gang is created.\n4. Since, their are gang and chop shop options there is a lot of confusion. So, we can eliminate the other options.\n5. If we take A gang is forming it is possible that they were forming a gang, like 5-6 people in the gang shop.\n6. As per the context that the \"gullible\" or \"chomp\" people who go in or into the shop where formed the gang, so the correct one is A.\n7. Since, \"gullibly\" or \"chomp go\" in the shop where created the gang, so the answer is A.\n8. \"Gullible\" or a \"chomp\" doesn't mean a gang, it means people who are not aware or unaware of what's going on. And they go into the shop where a gang is formed. So it doesn't mean that it's a gang shop itself but a gang was formed inside.\n9. Considering these point we can eliminate the other option and the answer is A.", "answer": " 38"}

Choices:  C) have a snack after the game or E) celebrate.\nRationales 1. The question says that \"we\" will do after the game.\n2. The key for the correct option is that \"game\" should refer to a single sport rather than multiple games.\n3. A single sport has an end and so does it take a long time to complete. \"After the game\" refers to immediately after.\n4. Having a snack after the games is appropriate after a single, complete sport. This is a sport that people typically play and/or watch as a single activity.\n5. A celebration usually needs a long time to complete, and is not possible to be done immediately after.\n6. Thus, option C: have a snack afterthe game, is the correct option as it is the single sport.\nAnswer: C) have a snacft afterthe Game\n\nInput: Some stores do not accept cash for payment.

The passage states that a person should mow their lawn frequently, but doesn't give any specific answer, making a range of answers conceivable.\n   A: 3 laps could be done every four hours, as shown in B\n   A: 4 laps could be done, for example, four hours after a rainstorm as shown in C\n   A: lawn tractors should most likely be used. Also, a battery-operated mower would not be suitable since the tractors run on combustion engines.\n2.  The number of tanks needed per day to mow the farmer's lawn is unknown, so any number could be an acceptable answer. \n   The passage does not specify what other tanks the farmer uses, so the question does not have an incorrect answer; D: 6 and E: 8 are both acceptable.\n   Furthermore, we cannot use C's answer as an answer to B. D: 6 is too high and E: 8 is too low as they are outside the range of options provided. \n   C: 3 has a valid answer in A: 2 as well.\n3.

Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n   Using mowers of different qualities is not a required element of the passage since it provides no data related to mowers of any variety. \n   Additionally, using different kinds of mowers of a different quality is also not an issue, as one can use the best mower for each mowing", "answer": " 1"}

The question asks for what the last game of the basketball team was, and since it would seem like not every last game involved ping-pong, it is most likely implied that a game should be considered the last one that they played, or they recently or most recently won.\n2.

Choices: \n A: the Philippines B. the UK C Germany D France\n  Rationales: 1 A: The Philippines - The Philippines has a large population of elderly people. According to estimates, the elderly population of the Philippines is equal to 9.4% of the total population of individuals over 15 years old, which is the second highest percentage in the world, so it could be the answer. The UK - is not mentioned as having the highest percentage of people 50 years or older, which means that it cannot be the answer. \n2 B. the UK - similar to The Philippines, has a large population of older adults. However, the percentage of older adults in the UK is equal to 18.1% of the total population over 15 years, making it the highest in all countries. Therefore, this is the answer to the question.\n  C Germany - Germany also has a high percentage of individuals over 50 years of age, equal to 20.7% of the total population in Germany of those over 15 years of age. Therefore, it\u2019s certainly a valid candidate to be the answer, however, the answer is not in this option\n  D France - France also has a high number of individuals over 55 years of age, but it differs drastically from The UK and Germany. France currently holds a percentage of around 28% of the French population over 15 being 55 years of or older. Therefore, it's certainly a possible answer, however, it is not directly mentioned as having the highest in any official sources, so it cannot actually be the answer.\n  E None of these countries - according to official resources such as World DataBank ( https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/4182-COUNTRY-LEVEL-DATA-1960-2019-CURRENT-47-90 ), the percentage of older adult 50 and older in the countries mentioned for the question is not as high as 28% in France or 18% in the UK as in the solution presented.", "answer": " 200"}

The given answer choices describe a time period for lines of workers who are obtaining food. This time duration directly relates to the time a line for obtaining food takes. This is because obtaining food (like purchasing food) requires time.

Four books cost half of the cost of six books, so they are 400. Eight books are more than four books since eight books cost $350 while four books cost $100.

For example, certain light wavelengths may alter the chemical content in the plant's leaves to change their hue, but usually, light serves only as an influencer and not a deciding factor.\n2) The flowers of certain plants may also contribute to the color of their leaves. For instance, if a plant leaf is red, it could be because the flowers are red or because the red color is present in a substance that a flower produces.\n3) Weather conditions such as wind, humidity, and temperature may play a role in decoding the color of a plant's leaves. For example, if a leaf is bright yellow in hot weather, it may be caused by a chemical reaction brought on by the sun's heat, rather than by the flowering process or through the presence of some other chemical substance in the plant's composition.\n4) Mood or psychological conditions have nothing to do with decoding the color of plant leaves.\n5) The season may only be taken into consideration where the leaves are turning.

A figure that does not have physical form - An answer referring to the figurative description of a ghost, as rather than an invisible entity, ghosts are generally believed to inhabit a physical space or form.\nb. a feeling of presence without physical form - A common misconception about ghosts is that they have no physical form or substance.\nc. a type of invisible of creature - Another possible misunderstanding about ghosts is that there are many different kinds, as in the sense of classifying ghosts as different types of creatures.

Choices: 1. yes, i mean, of course not; A: no 2. yes, it does B: yes 3. no C: yes 4. no D: no\nRationales: The scenario that describes this question includes an idea of a specific reading material that is likely to generate a specific kind of reaction, typically anger, among readers.\n1. We need to first understand the context here.\n2. If we read something that makes us angry, the typical reaction of being angry would be 'yes'.\n3. On the other hand, if we find something unpleasant or troubling, but it doesn't exactly evoke a state of anger, the reaction of being \u2018no\u2019 would be more appropriate.\n4. If the given context is interpreted in this way, option B would be the correct answer, as the sentence \"yes, it does\" seems to convey a state of anger, rather than a state of indifference.\n5. Therefore the answer to this question would be option B.\nAnswer: B: yes\n\nInput: A group of 4 men went to a hotel for a meeting.  What kind of meeting is this? Choices: A: business meeting B: community meeting C: family reunion D: political convention E: family reunion\nRationales: For the question: What kind of meeting is a group of 4 men attending at a hotel?\n1. We need three elements to know the nature, type, or purpose of this meeting, and in the given context, we have two out of three. These are the number of people attending this gathering and the hotel where it is conducted.\n2. But the most important element that is yet to be mentioned is the nature of this meeting.\n3. Only an official meeting, conducted for a business purpose or as part of a political convention can be attended by 4 men at a hotel.\n4. We can infer that the meeting is for a business purpose.\n5. Out of the 5 choices we have here, only option D: Political convention is an official meeting, while options A & C: Business Meeting and Family Reunion respectively are unofficial meetings.\n6.

Hence, the best answer is \u201c27 balls\u201d because the given values of red balls, yellow, and white are enough to represent 27 balls.

A: no, but A or C.\nRationales:  1. The question asks if you like to ride in a car while enjoying the fresh air blowing through the window.\n2. To choose the best answer, you must analyze the four statements that describe car rides.\n3. In the given passage, the first and last statements are both positive. This indicates that the other two statements have to be negative and thus indicate whether it is best to ride with the window open.\n4. Based:\nA: this statement indicates that it is not best to ride with the windows open. The statement says that you may get wet if you ride with the windows open, an effect of the wind blowing on you. This is directly opposite of what is being asked.\nB: the window is open, so there is less control over the temperature, which could be an issue if the temperature is hot. This is negative\n5. In conclusion, A: no, but not A or B: no, but no, but C: no, but not D: yes, but no, but no, because this does not make the most sense to ride in a car with the windows open in an area where you cannot control the wind that is potentially blowing.\nAnswer: B: no, but not\n\nInput: The book had an interesting beginning.

Why do some metals sink in water while others float?\n\nRationales: As water is denser than alcohol, an ice cube floats in water because its lower density causes it to be less dense than the surrounding water.\nAs some metals, like tin and lead, are denser than water, they will sink in water, while others, like aluminum and iron, are lighter than water and will therefore float.\n\nInput: What type of work requires you to do math?

A car is stationed on the highway (road) and this cannot be the correct answer.\nOption 3: A car is parked on a shoulder of a road. A car is not parked somewhere (on a shoulder of road) because it is stationed at the road or highway.\nOption 4: A car is facing in line with the driving direction of the street's traffic (facing in line with the same direction driven by other cars on the road. A car is stationary, meaning a car is not facing in the same line of the traffic direction.\nOption 5: A car is a car service that temporarily stops at a stationary location as a part of a business.

Landmarks are signs, features, or locations that serve to indicate direction, location, or other information.\n\n2. They can be things like buildings, monuments, hills, or other notable features.\n\n3. Clothing is not considered a landmark in a travel context.\n\n4. Furniture is not a landmark since it is more of an interior decorating choice than an indication of geographical or historical significance.\n\n5. Cute usually refers to something that is attractive in a playful or cuddly way. Therefore, it is insufficient to indicate directions.\n6. Color is the quality of an object that results from the way light interacts with it.\n\n7. A clothing store is a commercial site where one can find and purchase clothes. In this context, it can serve as a landmark only if it's well-known or widely recognized for its unique appearance or name.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \"Cute\" because it's the only option among all others that matches the requirements of the question.\n\nAnswer: C: cute\n\nInput: In football, what is the distance of the field?

The question asks if a certain platform allows one to play games.\n2. The information provided says that the devices in question are a cell phone and a video game console.\n3. The app \"Fortnite\" can be played on any platform since it is available on the Windows store, iPhone, and Steam.\n4. It's also possible to play \"Fortnite \"on an Apple TV, a web browser, and various other devices.\n5. The app \"Snapchat\" is not commonly used to play games, so it cannot be a possible platform.\n6. It is also unlikely that the app \"iTunes\" would be used to play games.\n7. The app \"Instagram\" can be used to play a game called \"Happy Wheels\", but this would be considered an unusual or niche way of using the app.\n8.

The train is a cheaper way of moving around\nRationales: Considering the given options, the first one can be eliminated as this description could be used to explain a preference for any mode of transit. The same logic goes for option 3, we can state that trains are a more relaxing way to move around on land, on the water and even in the air.\nLet's then focus on looking at the train as a landscape, either for its beauty, or as a cheaper option for transport.\nThe train can't be considered beautiful for the same reason as it can't be considered relaxing, it is a means of transit for many people who, by no means, are trying to enjoy the ride.

Choices:  D: wealthier richer A: wealthier B: poorer C: same D: happy poor E: sad rich\nRationales:  1. The passage asks how it feels to live as either financially poorer or wealthier. There is a subtle difference between the two, but it\u2019s still important to define the terms correctly.\n  2. One is poor when he is not wealthy enough to have his basic needs satisfied fully, which includes the ability to live in a spacious house or apartment.\n  3. It\u2019s different for a rich person. Wealthy people are individuals who can afford a spacious house, have a higher quality of life and lifestyle.\n  4. It\u2019s not surprising however that sometimes being wealthy can make one feel poor due to materialism or feelings of guilt, while being rich might make one feel more satisfied.\n  5. As for the term 'happy', we can find it in the choices B: poorer, C: same and E: sad rich and we know from the question that it doesn\u2019t belong to options A and D: wealthier and wealthier.\n  6. Option D: richer as being richer is about monetary gain or having a high income, rather than happiness or satisfaction in life.\n9. Option D: rich poorer and B: poorer could be considered as being about being richer and wealthier because of the high quality of lifestyle, however, they are both still about being rich and not about being wealthier and have more monetary gain or higher salary.\n  7. However, the correct answer is  E: sad rich. This is because it\u2019s not about being richer or wealthier anymore but about living a life of unhappiness or lack of satisfaction because of being rich.\nAnswer: E Sad Rich", "answer": " 163"}

The chef knows that one person likes the food the other doesn't, so TA: both is incorrect.\n2. A dish that has been specifically prepared for one person is not something the chef knows has been made, so B: neither is incorrect.\n3. The chef doesn't want to anger the person that doesn't like the dish and doesn't want to serve the dish at all, so D: one is incorrect.\n4. The dish that is served must make both people happy, so the answer must be a form of serving both people at the same time. TA: both is one possible answer since it implies that the dish is enjoyed by both people.\n5. TB: one could also work as a possible answer since the chef is going to avoid serving the disliked dish at all.\n6.

First we have to look at the numbers given to us and see how many each age could equate to.\n2. The first number is obviously 14, because 4 times 4 is 14.\n3. We have to do it again with the second number to see if both of our numbers match and they do if we multiply 2 times 3 and we get 6.\n4. The third question has to be a multiple of 14 because it is one after 14. Also, remember that the question said friend's best friend, so it is the same number as your friend's age, so we need to multiply 9 by 9 to get the number 81.\n5. The fourth question is 12 plus 2, which is 14. So we know for sure that one group's numbers are the same as the others'.\n6. The fifth question is 9 times 9, which is 81.

A good place to start is to eliminate any options that don't fit the description.\n    (1.5 minutes)\n3. A \"smartphone\" is a mobile device with a built-in processor, memory, and operating system, but wouldn't typically be used for playing games due to its small display, slow responsiveness, and inability to handle the type of graphics that are used in many games.\n4. An \"handheld\" device is often used for playing games, but would not be considered a \"device for playing games during a trip in a vehicle\".\n5. A \"game console\" is usually connected to a physical setup that includes multiple screens, multiple controllers, and more powerful processing and storage capabilities than a smartphone, but not typically used for playing games during a car ride.\n6. A \"headphone\" is not a purpose-built device for the question.\n7. This leaves us with the \"game console\" and the \"game console\" which are likely candidates for the question.\n8. A \"game console,\" on the other hand, is a dedicated device explicitly designed for playing video games.\n9.

Options 1 & 2 (It swallows entire schools and only small mammals) don't describe the action.\n3. Option 3 (It catches and swallos other sharks) is false.\n4. Option 4 (The shark opens its jaw before its prey). It's true because the shark waits and then swallows its prey whole.\n5. Option 5 (It jumps up and down and catches fish in the air). False, because it is not a realistic situation. Sharks eat fish in the sea.\n6. Thus, the correct answer is C: It waits.\nAnswer: C. It waits\n\nInput: What does the word vex mean?

Choices:  Because he thought it would be an excellent method to access money (cash less)   Because he was the first one to buy it in his area   Because it was considered a safer way  by his family        Because he thought he would use less of it in the future\nRationales: The teenager must have bought cashless cards thinking that it was a better option than carrying actual cash.\n1. Cashless cards are widely accepted forms of payment made of plastic that can be swiped, tapped, or waved. \n2. They can be used in place of traditional currency and serve the same purpose. \n3. There are several legitimate reasons why a teenager could buy cashless cards instead of carrying cash.\n4. First, they may believe that cashless cards are more convenient because they can be stored and used without worrying about security issues related to carrying large sums of cash.\n5. Second, they may believe that it is safer to use a payment card than to carry large amounts of cash.\n6. Third, they may believe that carrying cash is unnecessary because electronic payment methods are widely accepted and widely available.\n7.

Choices: 1) Fork 2) Spoon 3) Knife 4) Knife 5) Sponge Choices:  1: fork 2: spoon 3: knife 4: knife 5: sponge\nRationales: The question asks which of the given options the object at position five does not belong to.\nConsidering that, we first eliminate fork, knife, spoon, and knife from the list.\nThe spoon is used to serve food, which doesn't seem to be an item that is commonly included in a grocery basket.\nThe other three items remain as possible choices.\nSpoon sounds like a kitchen utensil used for serving food; in that case, the grocery basket does not include it.\nKnives are kitchen utensils that are used to prepare food.\nThe knives are used to cut and prepare food, and in the grocery basket, there should be none. So knives are eliminated as possible options.\nSponge is a cleaning utensil used in kitchens; it does not fit the required description of belonging in a grocery shopping basket.\nHence, option five is a sponge and is the only choice that does not fit into a grocery shopper's basket.\nAnswer: 5) sponge\n\n## Author: Hector", "answer": " 60"}

The passage describes a situation where a woman and her colleague were trying to find their car in a parking lot.\n2. While looking for it, the woman yelled loudly.\n3. Since the passage specifically mentions that she yelled 'loudly', she didn't just say it softly, she screamed out loud.\n4. In other words, to answer the question, we need to determine what a loud scream sounds like.\n5. The given options are listed in the decreasing order of loudness, from loudest to softest:\ni) Exclamation is something that is shouted out rather loud but does not necessarily sound like a scream.\n         ii) Yell is quite loud, and it is defined by different dictionaries as an expression of pain or dismay or joy\n         iii) Scream is a loud, wild, uncontrolled shout; it has high pitch and sounds shrill\n           iv) Screeech doesn't sound like a strong scream, and\n           v) Cry is a very loud shout but not a screech or a scream in the sense of a loud, shrill shout or a wild expression of joy or dismay\n         vi) Crying refers to weeping aloud or shedding tears\n         All in all, the woman screamed loudly and this answer option is the best guess.\nAnswer: D) Scream\n\nInput: Why do kids keep fighting at school?

This might not be the ideal fuel for an athlete who is in need of a boost of energy (i.e., a boost that isn't slow and steady, rather a quick boost)\n10). This is not a very good option.\n11).

It's also important to note that there could be multiple boxes, but for the sake of this solution, we'll only be looking at the possible locations of one specific box where the book was previously placed\n1. \"The book was in the box\" - This clearly tells us that the book was once in/placed inside a box\n2. \"What box\" - The question is asking us for the specific box that the book was in before now.\n3. Considering the information provided so far:\n   A: \"New Year's Eve\" - This is an event that takes place annually on December 31st which does not fit the description of the given box, so this can be excluded.\n   B: \"Trunk\" - A trunk (car) contains things that we need to transport and does not describe a single box where the book could be, so this can be rejected too.\n   C: \"Junk\" - Junk is described as things that people no longer want or use and it sounds like something that should be thrown away, not kept, so therefore this cannot be the correct answer.\n   D: \"Bank\" - Banks usually hold money, not small items like a book, so this is a poor choice.\n4.

Since gardens are usually in open spaces outdoors, these options describe activities that don't require leaving the house.\n2.

A storefront parking area will likely not have dogs allowed to enter, so it's unlikely that you would take your pet to one.\n  3.

This tells us that in this situation, people would be using either Imperial or Metric. \n2. Apothecarie isn't present in the list of options which indicates that the answer cannot be Apothecarie. \n3. The options Fahrenheit and none of the above are irrelevant when we consider that Imagine you are an Airplane pilot and therefore are incapable of determining what kind of measuring systems people use.\n4. This leaves us with the options, Imperial and Metric. \n5. It is logical that people use the same measurement system in their daily lives as they use at work. \n6.

Choices: 1: A: Someone went back 2: B: Something went wrong 3: C: Something happened last 4: D: A magical person came 5: E: A lot of people were talking 6: F: He had been gone for a long time\nRationales: The passage describes an event in the story where a person \u201cleft his house and found out something was wrong. He tried to fix it, but he made things worse. Then, he had to go back and fix what he just broke.\u201d\n1. It seems that the \u201che\u201d mentioned in the passage is someone who stayed with the Magical Tree, but then needed to go somewhere and \u201cfound out something was wrong.\u201d\n2. The next event is \u201cSomeone went back\u201d, indicating that he went back because something went wrong.\n3. Next, someone went back again, and this time, it mentions that \u201cSomething happened last.\u201d It mentions that there was something \u201clast\u201d at the time the person went back.\n4. The next event was that a \u201cmagical person came.\u201d This person \u201ccame\u201d next, indicating that after something was done that didn\u2019t work, he went to find other help.\n5.

There was a story earlier where \u201cA magical person came and changed everything. That changed everything.\u201d Perhaps the magical person was able to help the person who left his house and found out that something was wrong when he was gone.\n7.

Choices:  a: not calculate b: cannot solve c: not able to answer d: not complete e: unable to pass\nRationales: A) The given answer options are: cannot solve, not able to answer, and not complete. All these options have words such as able / able to / able to \u2026.\n\nB) None of these answer options is similar enough to be chosen as the correct answer to this question. None of these options has the word \u2018not\u2019 in it, although that word definitely appears in the question. Hence, none of these options is the correct answer to the given question.\n\nC) We can see that one student among others was not able to work on the math problem. That particular student's performance on that one math problem was different from everyone else\u2019s performance on that same math problem, and so, that student\u2019s result was a failure at math.\n\nD) We can see that a result was reached in this problem. That result is that one student is not competent at math, whereas one student is competent at math. Hence, a contrast between these two students\u2019 results can be seen as a math result in addition to these two students\u2019 results.\n\nE) We can reasonably infer that there is an additional feature or an additional concept that is only apparent to the author but no other students. Hence, the option e: unable to pass cannot be considered as the correct answer, even though that option makes perfect sense regarding that student\u2019s math ability.\n\nIf you did not choose answer C, you can check the following explanation for that question.\n\nThe only thing that the students couldn\u2019t do on the test was complete the math problem.

Choices: 1. 54,2. 45,3. 69,4. 86,5. 39,6. 78\nRationales: The question states that you can reverse a 3-digit by using 3 consecutive 0's instead of the digits to be reverse.\n1. We know that 54=66 and 45=87.\n2. Also, it asks about numbers that can be reversed by using 3 consecutive zeros, which implies that the number has 3 digits.\n3.

When using the answer options given, it's clear that only Fruit (B) options are being referenced, which means only A, C, D and E are the correct options.\n3. It's also possible to infer that the question expects the answer to be one item out of the four given options.\n4. Grapes must be excluded since they are a type of berry and not a fruit. We must also exclude Cantaloupe since it is a fruit in which you can take a slice and use it in salads.\n5. Plums are also fruit, but it's also possible that the answer will be a type of fruit that can be crushed into small pieces to add to salads, eliminating (C).\n6. Strawberries don't grow in salads. Therefore, the answer isn't (D).\n7. The answer (E), Honeydew Melon is the fruit that can be considered for salads. This is because we want an item from the options (C) that can be made into small pieces and added to salads. Honeydews are the only answer out of the given choices that satisfies this criterion.\nAnswer: E. Honeydew Melons\n\nInput: What country does a person travel to be closer to a volcano?

Consider that 'joy' and'sadness' are two conflicting emotions, so these should be removed.\n3. Next, 'indifference' is ruled out since it's the same as 'boring' and 'annoying', so it's not the kind of emotion that we can use here.\n4.

Choices :  A: zoo B: botanic gardens C: park D: nature reserve E: mountain\nRationales:  1. The question describes animals climbing on a structure, but not a tree.\n2. The only structures that could accommodate this type of behavior are a zoo, a botanical garden, a park, and a mountain. Out of these options, the first three are also places where animals would normally climb.\n3. The given context indicates that it is unusual for animals to climb on a structure that is not a tree. This eliminates D: Nature Reserves, as these are not specifically places where animals may climb.\n4. It seems then, that the correct answer is either a zoo, a botanic garden or a park. Let\u2019s look more closely at each of these options.\n5. We can rule out a zoo as this is a place with many animals, where the climbing of trees would, therefore, only be one of many behaviors.\n6. A botanical garden could host the type of climbing mentioned in the question, however we must consider that a botanical garden is not a place where animals would normally climbing things.\n7. Parks, however, can definitely contain climbing animals, as they serve as habitat for animals, and therefore, climbing trees could be a regular activity. It is also known to contain a diversity of animals.\n8. We can therefore infer that parks are more likely than botanical gardens, since they do contain many animals that might climb trees.\n9. We can eliminate botanical gardens, therefore making the answer choice among zoo, park, and mountain.\n10. We can eliminate a zoo, because there would be more animals than trees in a zoo, contradicting the logic of the question.\n11. A park would still accommodate the climbing of trees, therefore there is no basis to eliminate it.\n12. The only logical answer remains a zoo, since it contains trees, and a few animals, so the climbing of the trees by the few animals does not seem unusual.

We need to consider that this can have a negative effect on their self-confidence, and we need to find a response that offers a solution or at least a chance to redeem themselves or mitigate the consequences\n- Say nothing (no answer) - This could be an option we get, but it's hard to imagine a student would not say anything in response to their teacher's comment.\n- Accept the job (option A) - This response doesn't seem correct for our purpose, as we need to find an answer that can offer a solution to the student's problem or explain the cause for their grade.\n- Explain that it made more sense (option B) - This answer seems correct and in line with our purpose of finding a way to redeem the student's grade. 'It made more sense' is a vague way of explaining why the student's response was correct.\n- Say \"That wasn't (my) best work\" (option C)- This answer explains the cause for the grade, but it could be interpreted as a subtle form of blaming the teacher.

Choices:  (A) carpet (B) balance beam (C) trampoline (D) floor (E) ceiling\nRationales: (Read the passage carefully and choose the one that best fits with the context of each question) 1. The passage talks about: 'the high flying gymnast performing flips off her apparatus'. As a result, we have to think about what it is the gymnast will be performing the flip on. There are two phrases in the passage that suggest the gymnast is flipping off of an apparatus: 'high flying gymnast performing' and 'apparatus the gymnast flipped off of'.\n2. Option (B) does not make sense as a carpet cannot absorb the impact of the high flying gymnast flipping down from a height of 10 feet.\n3. Option (E), the ceiling, is simply no longer possible as the gymnast 'flips off' her apparatus but the gymnast has jumped so high they cannot even reach the ceiling.\n4. Option (C) is the only one that can be used as the gymnast is going to flip off of the 'apparatus'. A trampoline is the most likely source of this 'apparatus' as trampolines are regularly used for gymnasts to practice flips.\n5. All other options have no bearing on what is likely to happen before the gymnast flies through the air, except the balances beam. The only reference to a balance beam throughout the passage is to show the gymnast can go between her feet when she is about 10 feet high. This does not support Option (A).\n6. The balances beam cannot be flipped over because no force would support this action and it would be a dangerous way for the gymnast to start performing her tricks and flips.\n7. The gymnast may well do forward and backward tumbling on the floor, but as Option (D) mentions the high flying gymnist, she will most likely be performing her skills on the balances beam. This is not a flip, however.\n8. Hence, the only answer choice available in this question is Option (C) which", "answer": " 60"}

'Moving' seems to conflict with the text's description, as the car was not reported to be driving.\n3.'Crashed' means the car has collided with another, but the passage only refers to a \" car swerved\", not a car crashing.\n4. The term \"swerved\", when used in the context of moving objects, describes the scenario of a car moving off the road at some angle, turning left or right with the road's directional signs.\n5. Therefore,'swerved' must be the correct answer.\nAnswer: Swerved\n\nInput: What was the man doing when he got the award? Choices: 12, was  A: practicing C: talking B: playing D: working E: singing\nRationales: 'Was' in the given sentence indicates that somebody was doing something in the past tense. We would have used \u201cwas doing\u201d in present tense to report an action in progress at that time.\n9 Options:\n1. Choices: Practicing C: Talking B:Playing D:Working\n2. 'Practicing' refers to the act of becoming good at something through practice/work.  'Talking' means verbally communicating; one does not get awarded for such a thing, so this cannot be the correct answer. 'Playing' and 'Working' would both require that a person be doing something; if that person receives an award, they couldn\u2019t possibly be doing those activities.  'Singing', as the option, fits the definition and description as people generally receive awards for their musical accomplishments.  Therefore, as the only option which applies to the question and the description, 'Singing' is the answer.\nAnswer: Singing\n\nInput:", "answer": " 8"}

It was a pleasant experience for me. What type of restaurant are we talking about? Choices:  I: chain B: theme restaurant C: sports bar D: seafood E: local landmark\nRationales: The question asks us to identify the kind of restaurant that we were dining in.\n\n1. We'll exclude the false choice here.  Since the restaurant was serving delicious food, it is unlikely to be a chain restaurant that's known for its cheap, uninspired food.\n2. It wasn't a theme restaurant - theme restaurants often have extravagant decor and are inspired by mythology or a particular period, which isn't a theme the restaurant mentioned in the answer.\n3. A sports bar wouldn't be able to serve such delicious food as we know they have sports on TV, not cooking skills and this makes this choice incorrect.\n4. A seafood restaurant would most likely have a menu of seafood dishes that don't appeal to some people and this leaves us with either option C or E.\n5. E is the correct answer here as a local landmark is a place with significance unique to its community and, thus, likely to have high-quality cuisine. \n6. Additionally, as a local landmark may have been in the area for years, it would have time to build up a reputation for quality food.\nAnswer: E. Local landmark", "answer": " 7"}

It is important to understand the context of the question: A type of fishing that is done near sharks.\n2. Excluding the options one by one:\n  1. Spear fishing is done by swimming and thrusting a spear into a fish. This fishing process is not related to sharks.\n  2. Scuba diving implies scuba diving equipment which is a type of diving used to breathe air underwater using a tank and a regulator. Sharks cannot be speared as there is no need for scuba equipment.\n  3. Tuna fishing is the act of fishing for tuna. It is not related to shark fishing. There is no mention of a hook in the wording of the question. Therefore, tuna fishing cannot be considered as the correct answer.\n  4. Crab diving is a process consisting of catching, cutting, or harvesting crabs. The action of cutting is not related to the question as crabs are not meant to be cut when fishing for them. \n  5. Angling is the act of fisherman aimlessly wandering around, looking for fish. The wording of the question doesn't indicate that the process must be done near sharks. There is no need for a long angling rope. Hence, option 5:  Angling  is ruled out. \n  6. Then, the answer is option 2: Scuba Diving. It is done with equipment which can include a speargun, hook, or net.\nAnswer: 2: Scuba diving\n\nInput: What can do you to make a small amount of money, if you have a lot of extra time?

We know that the maximum is 4 fish, because there are four spaces where fish can go, and we want them to fill the 400L all together. So, this leads to the fact that A: 50 is not the right answer, we don't have enough space for 50 fish in our aquarium.\n2.C: 2 is the right answer, because if we take for example 4 fish, we know that they fit together in one space as they have the maximum space, but if we have two fish then obviously they can't be in the same space because there is 300L of space and only one fish can fit in it. And the fish need the remaining space to freely swim. The correct answer is 2: C.\n\nInput: The pig was named after a fruit:  A: Pink B: Pear C: Banana D: Apple E: Orange\nRationales:The given question involves a pun on the name of the fruit and the name of the animal. Banana is a popular fruit and the name 'Banana' has a similar pronunciation to the name 'pig' if you change the spelling. Moreover, it is clear that the pig does not share any physical characteristics with the fruit and has the initials B.A.N on its back. All these evidences make it clearer that the correct choice is B: Pear. The given clues may have fooled the test takers into thinking that pear is meant to be another type of fruit, but it is rather an animal species. The rest of the choices are incorrect, and as a proof, the following statement could be made: If the pig being named after the fruit was a valid answer then there would be two pigs which were named after fruit, as a banana and a pear are both named after a fruit. However, since there is only one pig, the question is faulty and does not make sense. Therefore we deduce that the correct answer is B: Pear.\nAnswer: B: Pear\n\nInput: P", "answer": " 52"}

Choices:  a: squirrel B: cat C: rabbit D: raccoon E: wolf\nRationales:1.The text provides information on an animal that is always hungry and will never be satisfied. So the animal must be a carnivore that preys on food and uses its sharp teeth to kill its prey.\n2. It is clear that squirrel (choice A), cat (choice B), and rabbit (choice C) are all herbivores that do not feed on meat, which means they would never be described as animals that are always hungry and never quite satisfied.\n3. An animal that does not fall into these categories is the raccoon (choice D). It is both an omnivore and a carnivore, meaning that it will sometimes feed on meat and occasionally on vegetables.\n4. Another correct answer is the wolf (choice E). It is a carnivore and a predator, making it more likely to be described as always hungry.\nAnswer: D, raccoon\n\nInput: Which of these is a way to describe an argument is based on feelings?  Choices:  A. emotional  B. rational  C. objective  D. irrational  E. logical \nRationales:\n1.

Choices:  a: how it is decorated B: its shape C: its smell D: its size E: its appearance\nRationales:\n1. The question asks how to differentiate between a regular, Jack-o-Lantern pumpkin and a decorative pumpkin used during Halloween.\n2. The given options are as follows:\n   A: how it is decorative - This is a vague answer, as it does not specify what types of decorations are involved, or how that helps in telling the difference between these types of pumpkins.\n   B: its shape - This is also a vague answer, as pumpkins of different shapes can be used for decoration during Halloween. It would involve looking at the texture, the inside of the pumpkin, and the quality of the pumpkin flesh.\n   C: its smell - This seems strange, as smells tend to differ between normal and decorative pumpkins. It could simply be a reference to the pungent odor that pumpkins usually possess.\n   D: its size - The difference in size between a regular pumpkins and a decorative one could indicate the usage of it. Again, it could have been better specified.\n   E: its appearance - Since decorative pumpkins are often smaller than regular ones, this is not a good answer here.\n3. The only reasonable answer here would be E: its appearance, as we are looking for the visual differences between them.

The group was happy to see her. She asked them how she looked. The friends said that she had put on weight.   What did she do? Choices: 1) She told them that was okay and returned to her home. (A) 2) She cried for a long time and drank all the coffee. (B) 3) She drank too much coffee. (C) 4) She made a cake and gave it to the friends. (D)\nRationales:\n1) The wording \"She saw her friends there\" indicates that the woman was sitting in the coffee shop with her friends when she found out that they thought she put on weight. This implies that the friends did not come over to see her, but rather she saw them already when she went into the coffee shop after a bad day.\n2) The statement \"the group was happy to see she was okay\" suggests that it was not simply the woman's own negative feelings that the friends were reacting to. Instead, the friends were happy to see her after she was feeling bad, thus showing that she had a bad day. This further supports option 1 as it is most likely that she would not have gone to the coffee shop if she didn't have a bad day.\n3) Option 3 is not possible as the information provided does not indicate that the woman was drinking any coffee, let alone drinking too much.\n4) Given that she went to the coffee shop after having a bad day, option 4 is the best answer, as she is most likely to have been feeling stressed and low in mood.

Choices: A: capture the flag B: tag, you're it C: truth or dare D: tug of war E: hot potato\nRationales: What's the difference between the people hiding - the first are hiding, and then the next person is hiding, and the next, etc. One person is always hiding while the rest are the 'free' players. The ones hiding are on the hunt and the ones free are trying to be caught by the hiders.\n1) Hide and seek does not have this distinction; the players are hiding at the start. Not the players are hiding.\n2) Tag, you're it, you can play alone with the rules if you wish, to do tag, you need other people, as the name suggests.  The players cannot tag just one person; if one tagged the first person then it's not like hide and seek anymore.\n3) Truth or dare, this can be played one-to-one, but the point of the game is to say truth or dare.

They are looking away E. They are smiling\nRationales: It can be deduced that the question aims to identify a characteristic of someone not being truthful.\n\nWe can eliminate option A because, if someone is lying, they will not look at you directly in the eyes. \nThe person is probably looking at their eyes in order not to lie.\n\nOption B is eliminated because people don't always look at one another's eyes when they are telling a lie. \n \nOption C is also eliminated because fear may actually be a sign of lying because even though it is not a clear indicator, it may arouse suspicion in the mind of the other person.\n\nOption D is also eliminated because we cannot identify lies by looking at a person's body language alone as there could be various reasons for a person turning away. If the person is being honest, they would generally face the other person. If the person is lying, then they would generally look away because they do not want to be directly confronted with their lie.\n\nWe can finally eliminate option E because that option is quite too general to be the correct one. \n\nHence, it is possible to arrive at one conclusion that a liar looks at their own eyes and avoids direct eye contact.

Her name was Carol. This isn\u2019t a clue on its own, but it is important to note because it means we can eliminate some of the other names immediately since they do not include the name Carol.\n2. Her name was Carol, and she said it was the name for a city in Mexico. From this information, we can infer that Carol, the name, could belong to her mother.\n3. There were six different names provided as part of this answer.\n4. First, we can eliminate M, L, N, and O. M can\u2019t be the answer since Marcia is not a Mexican name. Liz is probably not her mother\u2019s name since we don\u2019t see a correlation connecting it back to Carol. Nuevo is a Spanish word meaning \u201cnew\u201d, suggesting that it is not Carol\u2019s actual name or the name of the city her mother was from, which means it shouldn\u2019t be among the options.

The question asks you about a summer time happy experience.\n2. We need a happy moment we experienced during summer to answer this question.\n3. As the word 'time' used in the question states, this can't be about a happy moment in general.\n4. The options are all words associated with happy moments we experience.\n5. To make a choice from a choice, we make sure there is a good reason for picking the answer option.\n6. As far as the choices are concerned, the spider is a not happy moment. 'Spider' is often associated with fear. Therefore, spider isn't the correct answer to the given question.\n7. Since, the choice 'ice cube' refers to an ice cube, they are frozen. Therefore, also, ice cube is not the correct answer of the given question.\n8. The fire burns things, therefore fire can't be the right answer.\n9. Snakes are another symbol of something negative. Snake will also be eliminated as an option for the question because snakes can't be associated with happy moments.\n10. The raindrops represent something negative. Raindrops can make things bad, including your summer.\n11. We now have four answer options that are negative in character.\n12. Among the remaining choices, 'rain drops' seems more appropriate to the context of the question because raindrops can be found in summer.

So, it must have the adjective \u201cnegative\u201d in it.\nIt cut a budget plan, so to say it will \u201cContinue\u201d is not correct.\nIt doesn\u2019t specify whether or not it will \u201cEliminate\u201d, which can be both positive and negative.\n\u201cDiscontinue\u201d is not used in this context.\n\u201cStop\u201d is the correct answer.

A reference to insurance means the man's fear of his insurance company not covering the damage to the car.\nd.

Choices:  D: jungle E: Amazon F: ocean G: arctic\nRationales: Choices F and G are both incorrect, as the question requires the name of a place, and neither the ocean nor the Arctic can be classified as a place.   Choice E, the Amazon, can be ruled out as it is too large to count as a place.\nChoice D, the jungle, could be the correct answer. Jungles are places, but it\u2019s unclear whether people could \u2018learn to live with nature and [don\u2019t] abuse of it\u2019 in a jungle alone.\nThe rationale: A jungle is a dense, forested area.

Choices: 100 Cents B: we played tennis together C: he and I were in the same sorority, D: we met at a party and have ever since kept in touch E: we started working together\nRationales:\n1. The given passage mentions Buster Murdock\u2019s relationship with the speaker and their shared history as a couple.\n2. As such, the options to choose from should include all relationships.\n3. Accordingly, 'we met at a party and he has kept in touch' appears to be the most acceptable answer, as we can surmise that they are now friends due to initially meeting at a party.\n4. The other choices, 'we played tennis together', 'we were in the same sorroty', 'we started working together', are all examples of social and professional interactions that could have potentially led to forming a solid bond.\n5.

Choices: 1,2 A: After the first half 2,3 B: When the players were in timeout C: After the teams met 2,2 D: After Ronaldo returned E: When the second half started\nRationales:\n1. For this task, the solution will be found by deducing the exact second when the second half of the game began.\n2. First, it has to be established that the game was in progress as the given scenario speaks about Ronaldo's performance during the second half only. Thus, the game must be currently being played somewhere.\n3. Now looking at the options presented:\n   A: After the first helf - 1,2 is not correct. It states the two teams had an intermission during the second half. So what happened in the first half is irrelevant here.\n   B: When the players met - this is not the correct option. The solution does not have to do with the moment when the players meet and they could be in timeout at any point before the second half started.\n   C: After the teams meeting - this situation is irrelevant for our solution. We are looking for when the second half started, not when the teams met. So this solution does not hold.\n   D: After Ronalda returned - this is not the solution. He was still in action and took a break during the first half as well. So he did not return to play.\n   E: When the second-half - 2,2 is the correct answer. It is the only one that states precisely that the second half started during either Ronaldo's second goal in the first half or immediately after the first half ended.\nAnswer: E.

The word \"vacation\" indicates going away for pleasure, typically visiting a different place or region.\n2. Disney may be a fun place to visit but it's not a hard travel destination given its close accessibility by land, air, and sea.\n3. New York is a densely populated and urban city with many interesting things to see and do, but it's not inaccessible or remote, which suggests it would not be among the hardest places to visit on a vacation.\n4. Beaches can be accessed by car or by bus, depending on what part of the beach one wishes to visit.\n5. Safaris are a difficult and adventurous type of journey, but they are not necessarily the most difficult travel destination for a vacation.\n6. National Parks are large natural areas protected by the government, and can require expensive travel plans.\nAnswer: E, a safari\n\nInput: What did the students invent?

Option A suggests \"headwear\" doesn't make sense when you take the sentence into consideration as she is making food, she doesn't normally wear any kind of headwear.

The correct answer to the question \"What part of a body is AFFECTED by being dehydrate?\" is in my opinion C) brain.\n\nII.  For example, the bloodstream carries nutrients to every cell in a body via its network of blood vessels, and fluid is important for blood to carry them. Dehydration reduces the amount of blood available in the body. Decreased blood volume causes blood pressure to drop. A number of vital organs are supplied with blood directly from the heart via a single main artery. Without sufficient blood flow to those organs, they may fail to function normally. Heart failure can lead to stroke or heart attack.\nIII.  A water shortage in the body can disturb cell metabolism and damage major organs, especially the kidneys. Dehydrated brains do not produce enough hormones to function properly, resulting in impaired cognitive abilities, headaches or confusion. Muscles are also more prone to cramp when dehydrated.\nIV.  The lungs use oxygen. The function of the lungs is to supply oxygen to the body and get rid of carbon dioxide. Lungs have many blood vessels. Normally a significant amount of blood is pumped into the lungs.\nV.  Dehydration causes a drop in blood volume. This, in turn, decreases the amount of blood sent to the lungs, causing problems with breathing.\nVI.  The kidneys filter our blood, so when we are dehydrated they also have to try and cope with lower levels of water and nutrients. The result \u2013 kidney problems.\nVII.  The kidneystarts to get less blood as it gets dehydrated, and this causes problems over time. They help to get rid of excess water by letting some out in the form of urine, but if there is less water, then they won't be able to function properly. In response, blood vessels constrict and salt and water are pulled back into the body's cells so that excess water is not lost", "answer": " 13"}

The best response must answer the question by including a detailed rationale behind the most specific choices possible.\n1. To find the best answer, we first eliminate those which seem less likely.\n2. The frowning face (choice A) seems like an unlikely response for a teenager because they would potentially be annoyed with someone and not happy.\n3. Likewise with selfies (choice B), unless the teen was happy about the situation, a selfie in response makes little sense.\n4. The squinting face (C) is unlikely to be used by a teenager in response to something because this suggests a look of concentration and thus the person would not be in the position to respond.\n5. Similarly, the thumbs-up sign (E) is unlikely to be the response of a teenager as they are typically displeased or neutral.\n6. The conclusion is to choose the most specific response from those remaining.\n7.

However, since the question mentions, 'word' specifically, these aren't valid options. \"b) information\" is not a correct choice because for it to mean word that's not an item or concept or sign or name, it must also include a verb. Similarly, \"c) a concept\" is not fitting as a definition of a word either, as one needs a verb to be a concept, and an expression like \"word, a concept\" wouldn't be a correct definition of the term in this context. \"d) a name\" is not a correct definition of a word either because it doesn't specify anything that 'word' as an item might do. So, the only remaining option is \"e) a sign\" as it is a verb and describes action that a word, as an item, might do.\nAnswer: E Sign\n\nInput: How do you use the word latch? Choices: 1. a) as a verb b) as a noun c) as an adverb d) as a conjunction e) as an adjective\nRationales: The context gives us a clue that the question is asking how to use a particular word.\nBased on the context, we can eliminate \"c) as an adverb\", \"d) as a conjunction\" as the possible meanings of the word \"latch\".\nConsidering option (1) & (2): \"a) as a verb\", \"b) as a noun\"\nA verb would refer to \"1. an action\", so one may argue that this would be a fit case.\nHowever, a noun refers to \"a person, place, or thing\" and one can argue that this would be the answer. Hence, the answer should be either \"a) as a Verb\" or \"b) as a Noun\". If one", "answer": " 2"}

Now let us eliminate each of the choices presented:\n   A: Urban Sprawl - Urban areas often have spaces set aside for various parks, wildlife preserves, and other public green spaces. Therefore, urban sprawl cannot be found in urban areas. \n   B: Wild Animals. - Wild Animals are usually found in natural ecosystems like forests, mountains, and meadows. They are not typically found in urban areas. As such, \"wild animals\" is out of the options.\n   C: Subway - subways are found in urban areas, specifically. So, this is out of the options too.\n   E: Farmland - Like the choice B, \"Farmland\" cannot be used as an answer for this question either. \n3.

Choices: 1: I like to eat candy.  2: I like to eat pizza.  3: Pizza is my favorite.  4: Pizza is my least favorite.  5: I hate to eat candy.\nRationales:1. The phrase 'can say for yourself, but others would not say' indicates that the answer should accurately convey a statement that can be said by the speaker alone.\n2. All the given words 'Pizza' and 'I like pizza' convey the preference for pizza as food and can therefore be regarded as the same, which makes all the options identical. The word 'pizza' is a singular and the speaker is only referring to one food and not several food items.\n3. Option B is incorrect as 'I like pizza the most' is an opinion about the favorite food choice. As the question doesn't ask the answer to be someone's opinion, this can be ruled out.\n5. The phrase 'but others would not say' hints that the answer is something unique or unique from usual statements.\n\nAnswer: The grammatically correct sentence formed from these choices is 5.\n\nI hate to eat candy so it is my least favorite.\n\nIf the above phrase is followed by any other choice, the phrase will contradict the other choice, such as \n\nPizza is my least favorite means, the speaker does not hate candy, which contradicts the other choice. Hence no other choice will form grammatically correct sentence and cannot be included as one of the option.\n\nAnswer: Only the given answer 5 is correct and the other answers are no different from the given statement.\n\nComment: This is an answer, but it's not even close to being a model answer.

The speaker believes that a new ___________________ might improve the system. Choices:  A. design to make it easier to use B. device which uses less bandwidth C. model D. plan E. program\nRationales: At the conference, the speaker believes that a particular software system could be improved. This system needs to be designed carefully to make sure it is useful in the company. To help it work, the design can be made easier to use.\nThis can be done by using a computer system that provides better bandwidth.\nHowever, before we try a new software system, we should have a plan to describe how we will use or manage this system. This plan is a good idea, and we should include it.\nThen, we must include a detailed design if we want to make this new software product.\nBecause there is already a system in which the information can be put, we will need to make a good plan with proper designs and a good product model.\nAnswer: E, Program\n\nInput: What does the phrase with regard to mean? Choices: 1. A: about 2. B: after 3. C: at 4. D: over 5. E: with\nRationales: This phrase means \u2018regarding\u2019.

Yes, she did B. No C. She got a ride from somebody D. She went out E. She had some things to the list 1. The question asked whether a particular woman had to do something at the hospital.\n2. Based on the context it can be inferred that the hospital is a health care facility.  3. The first option A: \u2018Yes, she did\u2019 makes sense as it indicates that she indeed had to do something there. If she had something to do, it means she had to do something there, this choice is correct. 4.

Option C: Getting a ride from someone isn\u2019t relevant to the question, it does not directly answer the question \u2018did she have something to do at hospital/ medical facility\u201d.\n6. Option D: She went out makes little sense, if she had to do something at a certain place, then why would option D: \u2018she went out\u2019 make sense?\n7.

The third quarter of 16 which is 1 year and 6 months ago seems to fit the description of the question as the other quarters have not ended yet and the third quarter has not started yet to be counted as the first quarter.\n6.

Choices:  D: repeat A: perform C: vary B: do E: alter\nRationales: Let's first understand what each of the given options mean\n1. perform can mean to do or to engage in some particular activity.\n2. vary refers to a situation, where one does not observe a regular pattern. \n3. Alter means to make changes to a part \n4. Repeat refers to act or do a particular action repeatedly.\n5. Do means to act or to experience something\n6. Based on the options defined and what we want to do here, we can easily infer that A : Perform will mean to act at the same time repeatedly like when you repeat or do something.\n7. As the options given are all meant for single or repeated acts, this eliminates E: Alter as it only refers to change.\n8. Thus, the answer is A \u2013 Perform\nAnswer: A: perform\n\nInput: Who built the first model for how the universe looks? Choices:  E: scientists B: people C: researchers D: astronomers A: astrologers\nRationales:\n1. To understand who built the first model of the universe we need to know what a model is.\n2. We can define it as representation of the real world.\n3. This tells us that a model has to be a tangible thing that represents the real world.\n4. This rules out option E \"scientists\", since they deal with data analysis and mathematical modeling etc and not something that is a tangible representation.\n5. Similarly, option D, \"astronomers\" cannot be correct as they only deal with understanding constellations of different stars.\n6. Option B \"people\" cannot be correct as the universe does not only look at people but also at different things and objects.\n7. Option C \"researchers\" are correct, since they deal with tangible objects and represent them scientifically in a model that resembles the real world.\n8.

The options must be the words to describe words that have: making, hours, and easy.  Choices:  A. work  B. job  C. labor  D. industry  E. career\nRationales: The author is asking a question about the what work the best and wants the one that has many hours of it every week, easy it is to make, and easy it is do.\nThe options: A. Work- is for making, hours is for it and easy is for making. This option does not fit with the passage. B. Job- has many hours, making, and easy. This does not fit the description of the passage.\nC. Labor- has hours, making, and hard. This does not match the description of the passage, hours, making and work are very hard. D. Industry- has many hours, and making, this option does not suit the description because it's a way of business and not work. E. Career- has many hours to work, very hard to make and easy. This option does not match the description because it'll work more than eight hours, so it will not match.\nThus, if we had to choose, we can eliminate A to B and C to D to E. Hence, there is a single way to use these words together. If we choose E, then we can eliminate it's part which has many hours to work very hard.

We have the following information: 'Choose an item from below' implies our task is to pick a word that does not fit the other words. 'Which one?' indicates the specific word is hidden among the remaining three words.  2. From a bird to a house, these four items do not necessarily form a pair so there's no reason to consider these four options as a group.   3. Considering that, from the 'Do not belong' part, 'a car' does not sound the same with these four words at all.   4. Therefore, 'a car' is the word that does not belong with all the other words, the correct answer is (C) 'a car'.\nAnswer: (C) 'a tree'\nInput: One way to do this is to get rid of as many items as possible before making a decision.  Why would a person do this?

The question asks if Samantha is a night nurse. According to the information given, we need to identify if night nurse is a specific job description, or else, we'll be able to identify the answer as either true or false.\n2. We can rule out choices A and C because midnight runner & 1199 Union are not jobs, but rather, are phrases that can't directly be applied to nurse roles.\n3. We can rule out choice B because if she is indeed working as a nurse, she won't be part of the emergency department doctor.\n4.

Choices: 1 - 2 A: 23 B: 0 C: 1 D: 3 E: 2\nRationales:\n1. The question asks how many more penniesa are needed if you add a quarter, which is one more than a penny.\n2. We need pennies that will add up to an even number, so we subtract 1 from 1 + 1 = 2, which is not even.\n3. A: 23. Adding three pennies and one quarter yields an uneven number, so 23 more pennies would make it even.\n4. B: 0. This is not a valid option. Adding three penniesa and a quarter adds up to four, not three.\n5. C: 1. You only need an additional penny after adding the quarter, one penny after the first three pennies.\n6. D: 3. The four pennies do not even out, therefore three more are needed.\n7. E: 2. This answer is not correct for the same reason (not an even number after adding the quarter), but it's an option that might be confused for being the correct one.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: What is the term for a large number that cannot be defined?

Therefore, this should not exclude \u201cThe Graduate\u201d since it is the only word in the list not beginning with a year and contains more characters compared to the options, and considering that there was only one 1970 film listed under the top 10 most popular films, the movie \u201cThe Graduate\" stands out as the most likely answer.\nAnswer: The Graduate\n\nInput: Which of these famous writers spent 1/3 of his life in the city of Paris, France?

{"text": "Strip Mall\n\n### Demolition:\nA demolished building is a building that has been taken down or torn down, typically because:\n\u2022 it no longer serves its intended function. \n\u2022 it is to be replaced by a newer and more modern building. A building can be demolished for a number of reasons, including safety concerns (such as a building that poses a safety risk to people or other structures), structural issues (such as a building with a poor foundation or one that is no longer viable due to severe damage), or outdated design. The demolishing of the building involves the use of explosives or other heavy equipment to take down walls and other structures. It can include the removal of building materials, such as bricks and concrete, and the disposal of debris. Once the building has been demolished, the site may be redeveloped for another purpose, such as a park or a new office building. Demolished buildings can be a source of controversy; for example, some people may feel that the demolishing of a cultural landmark is a loss of history, while others may view it as an opportunity to create something new and better. Some demolished buildings are simply replaced with a newer, more modern version of the same building. In some cases, however, a demolished building may be entirely replaced by a different type of structure, as in the case of the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center in New York City; they were replaced with One World Trade Center. Another example is Battery Park City in New York City, which was built on land that used to be home to the World Trade Center.\n   \n### What would happen if the United States stopped manufacturing or making cars? \nThe U.S. automobile industry is a significant part of the country's economy and plays a vital role in job creation.\n\nThe U.S.'s most well-known automakers, General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler, have each had their share of public struggles over the past few decades.

Choices: \tA: half hour B: an hour C: two hours D: three hours E: forty minutes\nRationales: To be able to answer this question, one will need to know how much cheese is equal to 23 grams, and how long it takes for cheese to melt.\nTo determine which answer is correct, consider the options A: half hour, and B: an hour. If it takes half hour to melt 2 grams of cheese, then we can reasonably state it takes a shorter period of time to melt 22 more grams. We can, therefore, eliminate these options and focus on the remaining three, C: two hours, D: three hours and E: Forty Minutes.\nBy process of elimination, we can conclude that E: Forty Minute is the correct answer since it is the only option that matches the time required to melt 20 grams of cheese.\nAnswer: E : Forty Minute", "answer": " 1280"}

What does this indicate about Chinese culture? Choices: A: a large age difference among family members B: an early acceptance of aging C: it values education and responsibility D: it prioritizes the needs of the family E: it is accepting towards women who have children \nRationales: The government of China restricts married couples to only have two children. The restriction could indicate that the Chinese see a large age gap between siblings as a problem or that they prefer to have siblings close in age to raise together. We can determine the most likely answer by comparing and eliminating answer choices. Option B \u2013 The age gap between siblings is described as \"large\", not large as in \"really old\". Answer choices C and D do not make sense here unless every Chinese woman is already educated and responsible. Answer choice E is a possibility that is not stated here, but that could be the reason for the policy.

A fever is a temporary increase in body temperature typically due to an infection or other illness, and it can be an uncomfortable symptom associated with illness in general.\n3. Considering that, option D - fevers is the one to be selected.\n4. F, illness is very possible as the symptom of an ill, or the fever may be a potential cause of her perceived hotness. However, an illness is not always necessarily related to the fever.\n5. E, weather is not directly related to the specific cause, fever, and may not necessarily contribute to a woman feeling hot.\n6. G, air conditioning can't be a cause of a woman feeling hot directly, while the feeling of hotness might be indirectly affecting women if the air conditioning is set to be 'cool' or there might be not enough cooling in the room.\nAnother way to infer to reach an acceptable conclusion is to assume that G: air conditioning might be the most likely cause if other options: F: illness and other fever symptoms, D: fever and E: weather or other factors could be ruled out.\n7.

They just provide the wrong products. Option D is also ruled out because it' s not a store.

With it, people may take a blanket, chairs, a tent, hammocks, coolers, and so on.

Choices: 1. Turn off lights 2. Use more insulation 3. Use less water 4. Wash dishes with less water 5. Waste less food 6. Turn down air conditioning 7. Do not make more trips 8. Donate old electronics 9. Eat less meat 10. Use wind power instead of coal \nRationales:  \n1. The correct answer to this question must be related to either turning off lights, using less water, or making fewer trips.\n2. Using more insulation should not include turning off lights, as the two options are contradictory and will not lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide emmisions.\n3. Washing dishes with less water is a water saving measure, but not a way to reduce carbon dioxides. Similarly, turning down air conditioning and eating less meat are not directly related to preventing the emission of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n4. Donating old electronics is a waste prevention method rather than a way to stop carbon dioxide emmmissions.\n5. Using wind power instead of coal is a way of reducing carbon dioxide but it is not one of the questions options.\n6. Turning off lights is one way to reduce carbon dioxiode emmissions. However, it is more of a lifestyle change than a practical and effective way of preventing this problem.\n7.

Choices:  G. is one example of a noun. \nRationales:\n1. Here, the word 'definite' is being used as a modifier to describe whether or not a noun can take any of these forms.\n2. Therefore, we can apply the modifier to each of the above and see that:\n3. The correct options for definite noun are (A) singular and (B) standalone.\n4. Therefore, answers for (A) and (B) are definite noun.\n5. The correct options for non-definite are (C) the meaning may change and (D) countable.\n6. The correct options for intransitive verbs are (E) capitalized and (F) belong to a specific person (not necessarily a specific person, but to a specific entity).\n7. Options (D) and (F), are therefore transitive verbs.\n8. The correct option for intransitive verbal phrase are (A) book and (B) it.\n9.

Hence, we are left with options (d) and (e).\nOut of these options, option (e) correctly denotes those people who get the right for the first time to get a driver\u2019s license.\nHence, the correct answer is option (e) and the answer for the question is(d).\nAnswer: E: Old\n\nInput: Which is the most accurate way to describe a person who wears a hat? Choices: 1. An overtaken person 2. A casual dresser 3. A cool guy 4. A hat person 5. A hat-wearer Answer: 1. A person wears a hat is most aptly described as AN OVERTAKEN PERSON since any person that wears a hat is basically considered to be overtaken. If we consider the other choices, we see that the only one to be considered the most accurate is 'overtaken person.' The other choices are: casual dresser which is quite incorrect. Next is 'cool guy' which is not enough for description and the term 'hat-wearer' fails to define the wearer as 'overtaken' which is what should be implied.

Choices:  Restaurants B: farms C: beach E: playgrounds D: parks\nRationales: The question asks about a kind of festival called a summer festival. To answer, it is necessary to consider where such events are commonly held.\n\n1. A restaurant (option B) is a place to eat food, so it does not meet the criteria of a festival that includes music and food.\n\n2. A farm (option C) does involve the raising of food and might fit the criteria of a summer festival in some places, but it does not typically involve music.\n\n3. A beach (option E) is a place for recreation and relaxation that typically involves music and food.\n4. A playground (option D) and a park (option E) are also possible locations for such a festival based on factors like the type of music and food typically included in these situations.\n\n5. However, the specific mention of a summer festival in the question indicates that it is likely to occur during the summer months. Therefore, the answer must be a type of venue that is typically open and accessible during the summertime.\n6. This leads us to conclude that option A the city would be most likely to have the festival on, is the preferred answer.\n7. The festival could be held in a number of specific locations, such as parks or playgrounds, but these options would likely be less likely than the more frequently used spaces.\n8. For example, outdoor music festivals are often held in parks or fields, whereas festivals with food trucks and food vendors may be held in other areas like parking lots or plazas.\n9. Overall, the answer must be A: City, as this fits the description of a summer festival and can be held outdoors.\n\nAnswer: A: City\n\nInput:  What was George's first pet?

We know that Dianne & her daughter Sasha have recently moved to a new place, for which they require part-time jobs. Hence, the question essentially indicates that the place where they moved is a city. We also have a basic understanding of the meaning of the terms provided:\n   A) Retail clerk - A person who assists customers in a shop or store to find articles and makes money from this\n   B) Fast food worker - Someone who makes and sells food quickly at a particular fast food outlet\n   C) Hospital cashier - A person who works at the hospital to help people pay for their medical bill\n   D) Dental secretary - A person who works in a dentist office and takes bookings for patients\n   E) Nanny - A woman or man employed to care for a child or children\nOption 1: retail clerk - This is a good option to rule out since people who work as retail clerks don't make very much money from their jobs.\nOption 2: fast-food worker - This option is also a bad idea because people who work as fast-food workers make very little money, which is not enough to support a family.\nOption 3: hospital cashier \u2013 Similar to a retail clerk, the pay for these persons is not enough to run an entire family on.

The Olympics are the largest international sporting event in the world.\n2. However, there are many people involved in planning and preparing for the games.\n3. The closing ceremony is a grand event and spectacle at the end of all the matches, but it's not the main event of the games.\n4. Although sport competition involves sporting events such as track, field, gymnastics, and swimming, those events do not typically involve a group of people at a single location.\n5. Team meetings involve multiple team members at the same meeting in a single location, but the Olympics is not associated with a team meeting.\n6. Closing ceremonies are not the main event of a major sporting event such as the Olympics.\n7. Hence, the correct answer is the opening ceremony. The opening ceremony is the most publicized and well-known event associated with the Olympics. This ceremony involves the parade of athletes, speeches, and performances by famous artists. This event signals the beginning of the games and is a major part of the Olympics.\n8. Therefore the answer is B: opening ceremony.\nAnswer: A - Opening Ceremony\n\nInput: What was the best thing that ever happened to you?

Now she is worried about what? Choices: a: her college future b: her test scores c: her highschool degree d: her classes e: her reputation.\nRationales\n1. The question describes why Heather might be concerned about what's coming next.\n2. After getting in trouble, her future college grades are at risk.\n3. We can eliminate 'her college future' since this option refers to grades Heather already has, not what's coming next in her path as a student.\n4. 'Her highschool degree' can't be the answer either because this option is the one Heather already has and won't help her gain new grades or improve her grades at college.\n5. 'Her classes' can't be true since Heather won't have any classes anymore if she doesn't get into college. She won't have classes to take if her grades are what's getting her in trouble.\n6. 'Her reputation' can't be it either since it won't help her improve her grades.\n7. 'Her test scores' makes more sense here because it indicates what might be worrying her since Heather is worried about her grades.\n8.

The question suggests that the children were able to help their relative with her sickness and that they could have done something else to prevent a bad outcome. This means that the problem was not with how the children were taking care of their relative but with what was causing her to be sick.\n2. The fact that they could have done other things for her implies that there was an option to prevent her sickness. Therefore what would prevent her sickness has to be a choice.\n3. Out of the choices given:\nA. Gave her pills -This choice would mean that they only gave her medication and not anything else to help her be well.\nB.

Two strings, each measuring fifteen centimeters\n  2. Split each string into three equal, sixteenth-centimeter pieces\n2. A five-second question.\n3. The student was asked how to measure a length.\n4. This means the length was not given, but the student knew it was 15 cm long.\n5. Cut each string in half.\n6. The student was given a specific step, which is to cut each string in half. \n4. The student doesn\u2019t appear to know what half of 15 cm looks like.\n5. Each string is 15 cm long and can be divided into two pieces, one measuring 7.5 cm and the other 7.5 cm.\n6. Therefore, each part of the string is a five-centimeter piece.\n7. Therefore the student knows each part will measure at least 3.5 cm.\n8. Now, we must determine their precise lengths by adding 3 and 3.5. \n8. The student will receive seven and six pieces. \n9.

Hence, it is a sentence ending error and does not match the sentence structure or grammar. 4. 'keep smoke detectors' is incorrect as the sentence required is 'keep home from burst into fire'. Hence, it is also a sentence ending error and doesn't match the sentence structure or correct grammar. 5. 'Do not leave dry wood' is not a complete sentence nor is it grammatically correct. Hence, this option is incorrect as well. 6. To answer the question, we need 'a single complete sentence' according to the description and so, 'use fireplace' makes the correct answer. Option A is incorrect as the verb 'keep smoke extinguisher' is incorrect. 7. Option B is incorrect for the same reason as option A.\nAnswer: A. Use fireplace\n\nInput: Which of the following is part of a flower? Choices:  B: stem C: seeds D: petals E: ovary F: fruit\nRationales:\n1. The question is part of a flower and not just the flower as an object. Therefore, options not matching the structure of the main sentence of the passage (i.e, the question), are incorrect. 2. Option B, i.e, stem, is incorrect since it does not form a complete sentence and is also an appositive which means not necessary to the sentence. Hence, it is not grammatically correct. 3. Option C, i.e, seeds, is incorrect as it is the name of the item. Again, it does not match the sentence pattern and it is also an apposative (it is not necessary to the sentence and is merely name of the object) 4. Option D, i.e, Petals", "answer": " 20"}

Choices:  Fingernails or toenail mouth E: Brain\nRationales: The question is asking for the part of the human body in which we have the most hair. Considering this, the answer isn't Fingernails/Toenail since although fingernails and toenails have a layer of thin keratin known as nail, they are generally not made of hair.\nNext we eliminate options C, M, E, as these are not areas where human hair is normally found. The brain or any other organ doesn't grow hair and thus is not the answer.\nThe only choice that fits the description is option B: Head, as it is the part of the human that has the most hair.\nAnswer: B: Head\n\nInput: Which of the following is not considered a fussy eater? Choices: A: pig B: sheep C: cow D: horse\nRationales: This question asks which food-eating animal is least likely to be called a fussy eating when one considers their diet and personality. A Fussy Eater is an animal or person who is picky about the food they eat.\nAs per the options, a horse (D) is not likely to be called a Fussy Eater. Horses eat a more varied diet than other farm animals like a sheep or a cow, which means that they are less picky eaters.\nA pig (A) and a cow (C) tend to be more fussy than a sheep and a horse, which implies that they are more picky about what they eat.\nSo, it is likely that a pig and a cow will be considered fussy eaters, while a sheep or a horse will not be.\nAnswer: D) horse\n\nInput: You need to put away your pencil on which line?

Here are some basic differences between the two sexes:\n      * Males have a tail while females don't\n      * Males and females have a similar sized body\n      * Males are typically the large ones\n4. In this situation, a person can look at the size of the canine to determine whether the baboon is male or female. The question mentions \u2018larger canines\u2019. This indicates that male baboons have larger canines than females.\n5.

Choice A explicitly mentions paying for goods at a store using money, which is how we would typically purchase gifts.\nIII. Choices B, C and E do not necessarily require the use of money, as we could instead use a credit card, a computer, or use online accounts to buy gifts.\nIV. Choice D requires using coins and bills, which doesn\u2019t make sense for purchasing gifts.\nV.

Prepositions\nRationales:\n1. A noun is a word that refers to a person, place, thing, or idea. To identify a noun, we need to look at its function within the sentence.\n2. Verbs are action words that describe what the subject is doing. To identify a verb, we need to look for action words such as run, jump, love, or hate.\n3. Adjectives modify a noun, which can refer to a person, place thing, or idea. Adjectives modify the noun by adding extra information or describing it in a way that helps identify it more precisely.\n4. Finally, prepositions are words that indicate a relationship between two words in the sentence.\n5.

Here, we\u2019re analyzing each option in turn, starting with C: feather. Although a feather is part of a bird, a whole group of birds is called a flock, and a single feather can\u2019t constitute a flock.\n   2. Next, we look at B: flight. Again, this isn\u2019t a flock, although they can often be together.\n   3. Next, feather, again: Flights of feathers are called flocks, but flight cannot be a single object.\n      4. Now look at A: caws. No, it\u2019s not a single caw, and it\u2019s not a flock, either.\n      5. Finally, E: wing, it cannot be used alone to represent the idea of \u2018a group of birds\u2019 as it has its own separate meaning.\n2. D: flight - The correct answer for the 2nd question is D: Flight. The question seeks a single answer to describe a group of birds, so we can't accept \u2018flock\u2019 which refers to a distinct collection of birds. \u2018Flying\u2019 is another alternative, but birds fly on their own as single entities, not as a group. So we can't pick this either. Therefore, given the answer is \u2018flock\u2019, there should be at least 2 birds in the flock, but we can't make an argument to select \u2018flock\u2019 over \u2018feathers\u2019 that could represent 2 birds. If the answer was \u2018caws\u2019 and it represented 2 birds, the answer should still be possible, but we don\u2019t know what \u2018caw\u2019 represents as it isn\u2019t defined.\n 1. A caw is not an appropriate form of address and would be rejected as a possible answer. Also, caws cannot denote two or more birds in a group, so the use of this term to define a group of birds would require at least 2 caws.\nAnswer: A : Flight\nAnswer: B: Flight", "answer": " 20"}

The question asks us to choose a type of house that does not fit the rest of the options.\n2. Consider the options: Houses are typically classified into different types, such as castle, hut, villa, apartment and home-stay.  However, option VI does not fit into that list.  An \"apartment\" and a \"hut\" are both types of houses. On the other hand, a \"villa\" is a property owned by a large family used for vacations, and a \"home stay\" is a type of accommodation that is not a regular house.\n3.

Choices:  a: your car isn't working B: the trash truck is gone C: It is on fire D: the trash trough is not working E: your friend broke the garbage truck\nRationales:1. The given description sets up a scenario where the person is unable to take out the garbage because of some reason.\n2. We consider each available option one by one:\n   a: \"Your car isn't working\" is not a valid reason since in reality, taking out the garbage is not typically dependent on having a working car.\n   b: \"The trash truck is already gone\" doesn't seem to be a possibility either since trucks don't leave the garage until the next day and would arrive soon anyway.\n   c: \"It is on fire\" is not plausible, as it does not explain why the person cannot take out the garbage now.\n   d: \"The trash can is not working\" is unlikely because it is unlikely to be the main reason a person cannot take out the trash and more of an afterthought.\n   e: \"Your friend broke the garbage trash\" is unlikely as it is an extreme event and not one we typically encounter.\n3. Therefore, answer E: is incorrect since there isn't a valid reason not to take out the garbage.\n4. Option C: \"You have to leave for work. Therefore, answer C: \"It is on\" is not the correct answer\" is also not a valid reason not to do so because it does not explain why someone cannot take out the garbage specifically.\n5. Option B: \"The trash Truck is gone\" is not a convincing answer as it does not specify a reason for not being able to take out the garbage immediately. It's more of a post hoc justification.\n5. Therefore, the correct option A: \"Your car isn\u2019t working\" is the answer that best meets the description and the clues provided.\nAnswer: A : Your car isn\u2019t working\n\nInput: If you get to a destination before your train, what can you?

It is worth mentioning that meat (H) is a clear source of protein, but may be disadvantageous in some health- and diet-related contexts.\n5. Banana (B) is also a well-known fruit and can be a good source of protein, although we should be cautious about the quantity we consume.\n6. Broccoli (C) is not usually consumed raw but can be a good nutritional choice.\n7. Lastly, pear (E) is not necessarily a good choice for protein consumption, as it is relatively lower in protein.\n8.

Choices:  a: land b: peasants c: gold d: property e: horses\nRationales: We know that the nobility were the people with higher-class titles during medieval times, such as dukes, earls, lords etc.\n\nThe word property refers to a thing possessed by someone. It can also mean, a condition, attribute, or possession of a person, animal, or group. In medieval England, \"nobility\" refers to the higher classes, and the highest class was the aristocracy. Therefore, the nobility were landowners. In particular, noblemen owned a lot of land.\nThe word \"noble,\" however, means that the person in question is high status or high-nobility. Therefore, it is not possible to say that the nobility owned peasants. It was the nobility's responsibility to own peasants.

This means  they didn't finish writing and answering the questions that the teacher gave.\n3. From this, it is clear that the teacher will take action against the student.\n4. 'the teacher gave up' is not a feasible answer because a teacher would never give up on a student. They are supposed to help their students learn and improve until they get a good grade.\n5. 'the teacher gave the student a lower grade' is also not a feasible answer since, as explained earlier, the teacher knows all the questions and the students didn't complete the written exam correctly.\n6. 'the teacher failed the student' is also not a reasonable answer because the student didn't do anything seriously wrong and the teacher doesn't have the power to give out failing grades.\n7. 'the teacher gave extra credit' is also not a correct choice since teachers also know all of the questions and tests and would never accept an incomplete work for partial credit.\n8.

Choices: A: very small B: rather small C: moderate D: average E: large \nRationales: There are 7,000 species of ant and every one of them is different. For example, leaf-cutter ants build massive colonies with many tens of thousands of workers. By contrast, fire ants are solitary and do not form colonies. They are known to sting and attack with a high level of aggression.\nThese ants are notorious as household pests.\nMany species of ants are not so bright but some have sophisticated societies that help keep them alive, by working together. They can organize in elaborate chains of command and have an elaborate system of communication.\nAnts have several major organs dedicated to chemical communication. Pheromones are a powerful way that they can communicate. Pheromones have a lot of uses in animal communication.\nAnts produce and detect a tremendous variety of pheromone blends. It is assumed that the smells are similar to those that other ants have come to recognize as signals of threat or food, mating partners or other sorts of ants.\nIn a colony, workers respond in sophisticated ways to the signals sent by workers through pheromones. There are about 2,000 possible pheromone blend combinations in the leaf-cutter ant, Atta cephalotes. \nThere are many chemical cues in an ant colony that affect the behavior of a single worker. In the ant, Harpegnathos saltator one chemical that affects a worker's behavior is the concentration of its own pheromone.\nThe colony responds by moving the workers around to adjust for this chemical cue.\n\n1.

If you kept that stock for six months and then sold it, would your profit have been positive or negative? Choices:   A: positive B: negative C: zero D: equal to your purchase price E: equal to $100\nRationales:\n    1. In a few weeks ago, you made a decision to \"short sell stock\".\n    2. The answer will depend on the price at which you sold the stock and how many stocks you bought which you must know.\n    3. Assume that you bought 100 stocks @ $100. The change in price is $100 > $10 which means the total decrease in price is $90.\n    4. Assume that you sold the stock after a day, at a price of $90.\n               You would get back what you originally invested which is $10000+$9000 = $19000. It would now be $9000 more than what you originally sold ($10000-$9000 = positive return).\n    5.

If you held on your stock for six months and if the price remained at $100, you have to invest extra $9000 (100*9000). In other words, it would mean a loss of $9000 ($9800-$90).

If someone is a lier who only tells the truth, it is unlikely that they will be called lier. Therefore, if we see the word lier in the question, it must refer to the lier who tells half truth.\n2. The question is asking about comparing a lier who tells lies with a lier who tell half-truth. So the answer should be a lier who tells half-truth.\n3. The given question is talking about a lier who tells untruth. That does not fit the description of a person who tells half-trust because a lier could not only tell a half- truth.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: My little brother made a mess.

So we just need to distribute the pens and pencils to stop the problem of mess. And the question is not asking about where we will distribute the pens and the pencils or how? The question is a conditional sentence where the dependent clause will be changed.  We will give the pencils and the pens to the person. Then, the person will stop the problem of the mess.

However, considering the question given, we have to find the common element between the terms in question.\n\n  Let's see what each choice represents :\n\n   A - food : Yes, they are all edible products, however, this does not serve as a common denominator. Cocoa, milk, and Pencils can all be considered as food.\n\n   B - Stationary : It is common to find cocoa in a lot of stationary items. It can be consumed as a beverage, like milk and can also be utilized as a pen or a pencil for writing, so it is also a stationery product. However the other two, milk & pencils, are not necessarily utilised as stationery. This means that it cannot be termed as stationery. B is an example of an answer choice that satisfies only one condition out of two.\n\n   C - They should be used in school. : They can be consumed or used in school, but C can't be considered as a common element between the given terms.\n\n   D - The above choices all have a lot of letters. : It is easy to tell that D lacks any relation between the common element. Lettering isn't something related to Cocoa, milk & pencil.\n\n   E - Pencils, milk, & cocoa can be considered stationary : This does not satisfy the condition of all three having something in common. So it is an incorrect choice. Stationary doesn't apply to milk & pencils. Only one out of three are suitable for stationary use.\n\n   Finally A, food, represents the common denominator between the given terms.", "answer": " 300"}

The given question asks us to determine the type of carpet that is most vulnerable to stains over time.\n2. Consider each of the given options carefully:\na. Rug is not a correct answer because it refers to a specific type of flooring cover which is generally a floor covering that is tied down or fastened in place, not a type of carpet.\nb. Synthetic refers to any of various polymeric materials (as nylon or polyester) that can be manufactured by a chemical synthesis process and thus is not a type of carpets.\nc. Nylon is not a type of a carpet because it is a polymer that is usually used to produce clothes and other textile items.\nd. Linen is another incorrect answer because it is not a type of floor covering or carpet, it is a type of fabric made from flax fibers.\ne. Plastic is an even more inappropriate answer because it is a type of rigid, synthetic, or semi-synthetic polymer that is derived from petroleum.\n3. Hence, the only correct answer is option B: 'Synthetic'. Synthetic is a type of carpet that uses man-made materials to simulate the look, texture, and feel of natural fibers. These materials are designed to be durable, stain-resistant, and easy to clean, making them an ideal choice for homes and offices. Over time, synthetic carpets can accumulate dirt and stains, but with regular vacuuming and steam cleaning, you can keep your synthetic carpet looking like new.\n4. So the correct answer is B: Synthetic.\nAnswer: B: Synthetic\n\nInput: Some kids at the school have been found eating candy hidden inside books. What is this called?

Choices:  B. ability C. skill D. action E. ability\nRationales: As the clues given in this question, it can be inferred that the term is referring to some quality or characteristic that a person has, either innate or acquired, that allows them to perform a specific task better than others.\nThe options that can fit this definition (B. ability, C. skill, and D. action) can be ruled out since they can mean more than one thing. For example, the term 'ability' can also refer to a characteristic someone has that allows them to do something well, which makes this option too generic for the current context.\nWe can also find this meaning for the term'skill' and 'action', and they can have multiple definitions that don't necessarily involve being used in difficult situations or being important in daily life.\n\nIt is important to note that the word that fits this description is 'E. ability' since it's the only option that exactly fits the context and meets all of the stated criteria.\nAnswer: E. ability\n\n### Instructions for the Grader\n\nGrade the response as **Correct** or **Wrong** on the lines below.\n\n### Grading for \"Answer the following grade math questions\":\n\nIf the answer is **Correct** then:\n\nIn the score cell, mark 5 points for the question type, and 3 points for the correct answer.\nIn the user cell, mark '5' for the user type (student).\n\nGrade the question and responses using the instructions for grade the response correctly.\n### Grading Instructions\n\n* To grade students' responses correctly, first type the question number then the student's ID number followed by the number of points for the question type and points for the correct answer on the score cell.\n* Then type the grade of the response followed by the student's ID on the user cell.\n\n### Submit\n\nUse the'submit' button to save the score for each student and the final student score.", "answer": " 300"}

It is too early (but it's still trying). c. I'm not the only female cat here. d. Where are you, male cat? e. It's really lonely here.\nRationales: It is implied that the cat \"that's in heat\" represents female cats in general, to make it easier to understand the entire scenario.\n1. The given information only indicates that the male cat can possibly desire to mate if he approaches a female cat who's in heat, so option A: 'Is there a male cat near home?' doesn't fit the scenario, as the answer for such question wouldn't be relevant here.\n2. The word \"early\" in option C: 'It's too early but I'm still trying' doesn't signify at what time, so this option is also removed.\n3. Option B: 'I'm not the only cat here', although can mean just that, in this scenario is referring to other female cats in general.\n4. Therefore, it can be claimed with certainty that the correct options are E: 'It's so lonesome here' or D: 'Where are you, male cat.\nWith further analysis, option D: 'Where are...' seems to be the correct one since it fits the description most fittingly.\nAnswer: D - Where are you?\n\nInput: A person on a cruise ship is lost because it is foggy.

The question asks the person \u201cWhat do you like about the cutes dog that you met yesterday?\u201d\n2. To answer this question we need to choose one of the answers from the choices.\n3. This question doesn\u2019t describe any kind of shape or other qualities other than its cute appearance.\n4. Therefore, we should consider the answers from the choices given by the question.\n5. A: Fur(S)  F: Fur or Coat(S) \u2013 These types of answers can\u2019t be considered because they refer to \u201cfur\u201d and \u201ccoats\u201d that are worn and not applied to pets.\n6. B: Fur/Furs - One particular answer from the choices can be considered correct. One might not find this animal cute, but the word fur in the answer can be understood as a single fur.\n7. C: Eyes \u2013 This answer doesn\u2019t seem to be the correct one because it\u2019s not a specific part of the cute dog that the person may like.\n8. D: Barks Or Dog park - This part of the answer is related to the appearance and characteristics of the dog.\n9. This could be the correct answer since one may find the dog cute because it barks or they like the dog park that they are in.\n10. E: Snout \u2013 This part of the answer refers to its nose and does not seem to be cute according to the instructions.\n11. F: Ears - This part of the question can be the correct answer because one may have found its ears cute and want to know what they do exactly.\n12.

The first option is a monarchy. A monarchy is a type of government where power is concentrated in the hands of one person, called a monarch, who may or may not rule with the assistance of an advisory council. The monarch holds the ultimate executive, legislative, and judicial authority in the country and serves as both head of state and head of government. Democratic government is a system of government that allows the people to have a say in the laws that govern them and their country. This can be done through democratically elected representatives, public meetings, referendums, referenda, etc. Democracy can also be found in a few different types, the most common being direct democracy and representative democracy. Direct democracy allows citizens to vote on a specific issue, while representative democracy allows voters to elect representatives who then make laws and represent the interests of the constituents. The second option is a democracy and so is different from the first choice, which is a monarchy.\n  2. Both the first and the second options are democracies and so are not the same.\n  3. The third option is a republic, which is different from both a monarchy and a monarchy.\n\n4. This is because in a republic, political power is held by citizens that have elected representatives, rather than by nobility or a monarch, meaning it differs fundamentally from a monarchy.\n5. The fourth option is a dictatorship.\n  6. Dictatorship refers to a political system in which individuals exercise absolute authority over nations. This type of rule is not found in democracy as in a democracy, citizens have a say in the law. Also, the first five options are democraces and hence all different in terms of how political power is transferred in a government system.\n\n7. Option number 7 and 8 are both types of governments where citizens can choose their rulers. In option #7, citizens", "answer": " 28"}

The question asks how to know that something is a mall, and it has to be a place where goods are sold.\n2. We need something that fits the description of a place that is full of stores and/or businesses.\n3. We can eliminate option A because it doesn't mention that something needs to be \u201cin a place where goods are offered for sale\".\n4. It doesn't give a specific requirement and could refer to anything, in the context of the question it indicates something that is rather a building than a place.\n5. We can eliminate option B because it seems like it could refer to anything and doesn't strictly follow the criteria for something that constitutes a mall or a place from which people can buy goods. \n6. We can eliminate option C because it is not something associated with malls or where we can buy goods.\n7. Option E suggests that we can determine that something must be a mall if it has a place where you can find something useful. It also suggests that malls provide a service if they have a place where you can buy something useful. We can analyze this answer using the same principles: \n  a. Malls must have the right location but don't necessarily offer any service. \n  b. Malls must have at least one building or structure but don't necessarily have something from which we can get what we need(useful \n7. Malls should be full of stores or businesses, not necessarily service facilities. \n8.

Choices:  B: someone trying to take advantage of someone else   C: someone trying to take away someone else's advantages   D: lying\nRationales: The question here is the meaning of the metaphorical phrase \u201cPants on fire\u201d. This phrase can be interpreted as meaning someone is lying and that their \u201cpants\u201d signify their sense of self-esteem.\nLooking at the options we can see that B: someone trying to \"take advantage\" of someone else means that this phrase is used to describe a person that wants to get the advantage over someone else in a business or personal deal.\nC: someone trying to \"steal\" someone else's abilities denotes this phrase is being used to describe a situation where one person wants to copy or steal the potential or potential achievements of someone else.\nD: A lie signifies the \u201cno pants\u201d expression.\nThrough the provided information, in this case, an answer can be concluded based on the reasoning that B: someone trying \"to take advantage\" of someone else is the most suitable answer.\nAnswer: B: someone trying to \u201ctake advantage\u201d of someone else.\n\nInput: After the storm, a neighbor decided to water their garden.  They needed to use how many cups to fill one gallon? Choices:  One cup B: two fifths C: two fifths D: Four cups E: eight pints\nRationales: In order to find the correct answer, we will need to be aware of what a gallon is. \nIf we consider a gallon, we can find there are eight cups in one gallon. Each of these cups is one cup. Thus to fill one gallon we\u2019ll need at least one cup that is in a gallon.\nLooking at options we can conclude two options are completely wrong, they are C: two fifths, D: Four cups. \nThe option C means, that there would be 2 fifths cups which amount to 1 cup which is not equal to 1 gallon. Similarly to the option D: four cups, it is also equal to 1 cup.\nNow we can conclude the correct and only suitable answer is A: 1 cup.\nAnswer: A. 1 cup.\n\nInput:", "answer": " 134"}

Choices:  a: street corner b: near a restaurant c: in the street d: at a parade e: across from the bus stop\nRationales: The question is concerned with a baker who is attempting to sell bread.\nTo be able to make money the baker should decide on the best possible place to sell bread.\nIn order to answer the question we need to find out what are the different types of places one could set up their cart for selling bread.\nWe'll examine each of the given options.\n\na: street corner: No, it is not a place where a bakery can have a successful business. Street corners are small areas with little space, and they are not typically locations where high concentrations of people pass by.\n\nb: near a restaurant: This option is possibly a good one. Restaurants can draw in the customers, but it is up to the baker to attract the customers' attention and convince them to buy the bread.\n\nc: in the street: No, it does not indicate an area where the set mentioned business can be next to one another and is considered a place to sell.\n\nd: at a parade: A bakery might set up at a parade because many people go to a parade and some might stop to buy bread on their way or while attending the parade. A bakery is much more likely to make a sale at a parade than a bakery at a street corner.\n\ne: across from the bus-stop: Certainly, many people pass bus stops and a bakery next to it can attract some of those people. The customers who are not hungry but would buy bread to eat while walking somewhere may consider a bakery next the bus stop as an attractive place to make a purchase.\n\nHence, the question is to find out what are all the places where a bakery sell bread next to a bus stop.\nc: In the street and e: at a parade are the appropriate options which describe such a scene.

The question entails animals seeking shelter from the heat, however, given the context of the question, we can eliminate W: zoo because it doesn't make sense for animals to go to a zoo for shelter from the heat when the weather is nice.\n2. Similarly, A: home is an unlikely option because it doesn't align with the context of the question in which the weather is hot and nice.\n3. B: store doesn't fit the context since animals don't typically shelter in stores from the heat; stores are for people.\n4. C: pond may seem like a possible answer, but because it's not mentioned as \"hot \"weather\" nice\" in the question, C: pond can also be eliminated\n5. D: outside yard doesn't fit the weather context of the question, since the weather is specified as \"hot\" and \"nice\"\n6. Hence, only one option left is the correct option. The only option that makes sense in the context of animals seeking shelter from the hot weather is E: beach because of the following points:\n   a) The weather specified in the question is hot & nice and the beach does provide a cooling effect for animals seeking shelter from the scorching heat\n   b) The beach is a natural place where animals can seek shelter from the scorch of the sun\n   c) animals find shelter from the sun to replenish the cooling effect that nature provides\n7.

What game is played with two players and no cards is the question the author is trying to answer, so we must consider only two possibilities.\n2. We need a game that can be played by only two persons, since it is a duo.\n3. The game we are looking for has no cards involved, and the list contains all the games one could expect, but they all need a card, which means we must exclude them in order to find the correct answer.\n4. Out of the remaining possibilities, chess has boards and no use of cards.  Checkers only contains two different colors' pieces, therefore it is not possible to play with only two people.\n5.

Some examples of such devices include a can opener, a key, a crowbar, and a jackhammer. On the other hand, pieces of equipment like bottle openers, corkscrews, and shovels can also open cans.\n3. Hence, the choices we should consider are c: knife, d: opener, f: scissors, and g: a can.\n4. However, we will continue to eliminate choices based on the meaning of the question to ensure a better understanding of the situation.\n5.

Here the patient is described as having dental checkups or dental visits.\n1. Dental is the word that best fits the role of a part of mouth that involves the presence of teeth, so it's very likely that the medical procedure involved a procedure related to teeth.\n2. Based on this statement, 'oral' is a better and more appropriate term than 'dental'.

Choices:  a) Gravitational energy and potential energy b) Gravitational potential and kinetic energy c) Potential energy and velocity d) Gravitational and kinetic energy e) Gravitational kinetic and potential energy\nRationales: The question demands comprehension of the energy transfer taking place in a waterfall, involving the conversion of two kinds of energy.\n\nAnalyse the options:\n\na) Gravitational energy and potential energy: Gravitational energy is the potential energy due to the position of a mass in the field of force of gravity. It does not play a role in the waterfall setting because the water in a waterfall falls down.\n\nb) Gravitational potent and kinetic: Potential energy due to a body's position in the field of force will not be used up as heat in the body. The word 'kinetic' has a different meaning here. Kinetic in the scientific sense refers to the energy of the motion of the falling body, i.e. its velocity or speed of fall. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nc) Potential energy and V elocity: A substance moving through a container from a point of a lower potential to a point of a higher one, which gives it velocity with every drop, does not involve energy conversion. The energy lost in transfers to the energy released in collisions and the energy needed to keep the liquid flowing is never used to change other types of energy. Hence, this option is incorrect as well.\n\nd) Gravitational + kinetic: In this option, the water in a water fall moves as both a kinetic system and a gravitational system. The two energy forms move in the same direction but are never used to switch types of energy.

Choices: 1: circle is 2: circle is 4: square is 10: circle is 10.000000: square is 1:000:000.000: circle is 2.000:075: square is 1-000:034: circle is 20:035: square is\nRationales: The question is asking how many times the radius of a circle is larger than a side of the square. To answer this, we must measure both sides of the square and the radius of the circle.\nThe units of measurement of the answer must also be the same as the units of measurement of the sides of the square and radius of the circle. Here, we will use the English number system for simplicity in describing the answer.\nThe only given option whose units of measurement are a standard unit used in English is 1.\n\n## Rationales for Answer A\n\nThe first option gives a ratio of the two items so that multiplying the numerator of the first ratio by the denominator of the second ratio would result in the answer. However, doing so doesn\u2019t result in the question's number. This is false.\n\nThe second option doesn\u2019t contain any units of measurement, so there is no way to directly measure the ratio. This is false. \n\nThe third option doesn\u2019t describe the ratio directly. Instead, it compares a circle to a square that is 10 times the area of the circle, meaning that the square is ten times larger than the circle. This answer would be incorrect.\n\nNext, the fourth option is saying that the circle is 10 times larger than the square that is a million times the area of the square. It doesn\u2019t give any information about the radius of the circle or the length of the side of the square. This answer would be incomplete, in which case the incorrect answer would be correct.\n\nLastly, the fifth option is too inaccurate to be correct. Say that the side of the square is 20; the radius of the circle is then 4 since the radius is half the diameter. This answer should not be the correct option. \n\n## Rational for Answer B\n\nThe", "answer": " 15"}

Choices:  T: To protect the engine B: Used for driving C: Used for transportation D: Used for racing E: None\nRationales: Considering the given statement that there is a starter box on a car and the answer that we want to find, we need to find the meaning of the word \u2018starter\u2019.\nThe word \u2018starter\u2019 comes up from the sentence \u201cTURN THE STARTER AND LOOK FOR THE STAMPED DISTANCE\u201d. The given word is used in context of car or vehicle.\nWhen a car is being started, the process of turning the starter is required which will in turn provide the required information i.e. the driving distance of the car once it is started.\n\nAnswer: TURN THE STARTER\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following grade math questions.\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: A woman has nine coins. She has three more heads than tails, and the total value of her coins is $4.56. What kinds of coins are they? Choices: A. 5 pence, 5 cent, and 30 cents B. 50 Euro and 10 cents C. 40 cent and 1 Euro D. 2 Euro and 1 Euro E. A quarter and 4 dime\nRationales: After reviewing the information given, it is evident that the nine coins are in Euro currency as the following statement is given that \"The total value of her coisns is $4.55\". There is 1.2 Euro in US dollar, hence the total value of European coins would be $4.55.\nNext given info about the total number of head and tail, implies that the coins are in a set of 3,2. This statement \"the woman has three more heads than tailes\" cannot be true if the total number of coins were even, as in the case of Euro currency.\nNext there is provided info about the combined value of the coins as $4.55, which in Euro currency is equal tp 2 Euro and 4 dime.\nThe only option that fulfills the above info are options B. 50 Euros and", "answer": " 97"}

Consider the information given in the question: \"A clown's trousers get worn to the knee.\"\n2. It's clear that the clown's clothes don't have any damage and are still suitable to wear to a show.\n3. Therefore, the phrase \"the clown is still clothed for the show\" must be referring to something that could be worn to the show.\n4. Each of the options is a type of clothing that can be worn to a show or theater event, with B: \"shower caps\" being the most specific and least likely to be confused with anything else.\n5. For example, you can't go to a show wearing \"the show\", which is a logical word play between \"the show\" and \"theatre show.\"\n7. Overall, based on the information provided and logical analysis of the options, the best answer for this question is B: \"shower cap.\"\nAnswer: B. Shower cap\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following health question.\n\n## Instruction:Answer the medical question.\nInput: Why is it important to have a doctor visiting a hospital? Choices: A: to take care of patients. B: the hospital staff.  C: to examine patients. D: the patient\u2019s ward. E: to treat patients.\nRationales:\n1. Considering the information provided in the question, it is logical to infer that a doctor visiting a ward involves interacting and providing care to patients.\n2. Similarly, the phrase \u201cfor medical care to a patient in the hospital\u201d implies that the doctor is attending to a patient, which is consistent with care for patients, and not the other options mentioned in the question, including staff and examinations.\n\n3.\n3. Therefore option D: \u201cto take care of patients\u201d is the most apt choice.\n4. Option A: \"to take care of patients\" is a better phrasing choice than \"take care of the patient\" as A: \"to take\" refers to", "answer": " 6"}

The given passage discusses a situation wherein a lecturer has found a book for the classroom and must decide on where to store it for future use.\n2. Keeping in mind that the room in which the lecture is being held, must house books from a library in a bookcase, a desk, a shelf or a table.\n3. Therefore, based on the factual information, the lecturer can store the book in any of the areas/locations mentioned in the question.\n4. However, out of these possibilities, bookcase seems to be the most reliable way to store a book for the class.\n5. Hence the answer is D: book.\nAnswer: D\n\n#### Question 10\nInput: Where is the sunlight the brightest? Choices:  B: in town C: in the morning D: at school E: inside the house\nRationales: The given passage describes a situation where a group of students is trying to figure out in which place, they are likely to experience the sunlight the brightist.\n  1. Taking this into account, we need to determine which of the following places will best align with the sunlight's brightest moment.\n  2. The most direct response is E: inside the house.\n    2.1. In the morning the rays of the sun can reach inside a house, and they do indeed make the house much warmer and brighter.\n    2.2. For example, during the winter when it is snowing outside the light of the sun can come in through the window, even though it is snowing outside.\n    2.3. Similarly, during the winter we experience the sun's rays from inside our homes, even if it is raining outside and the weather is much more cloudy.\n    2.4. Hence, there isn\u2019t any way in which any of the other options mentioned can possibly be classified as more likely than inside the house.\nAnswer: E", "answer": " 140"}

Choices:  a: to burn an ice pack b: to burn down a frying pan E: use frying pan ice pack to cook on an oven c: use frying panel ice pack to boil water d: to use ice pack to cool frying pan\nRationales:1. The given scenario involves using a frying pan which is a cooking surface made of cast iron, steel, or another heat-resistant material, along with an ice pack to cool a frying pan.\n2. The question asks how to do this, and the answer doesn't have to provide steps, just an option to consider.\n3. The word 'use' can't be narrowed down to any one particular item, as it's a broad term that could refer to both the cooking surface and the ice pack.\n4. The word, 'down' can't be considered as it doesn't have anything to do with the use of the frying pan and ice pack to cook or cool.\n5. The word 'Oven' is generally used to refer to a place for baking or cooking, and not necessarily what's used to put food on.\n6. Thus, it's best we focus on the words 'boil' and 'cool', and eliminate the least relevant options.\n7. As a frying pan boils water, it can't be boiled for cooking again, so choosing the word 'boil' excludes A, B, C, and D altogether.\n8. 'To be used' isn't the correct definition of how to boil, rather it has to do with cooking, and an ice pack wouldn't be used to cook, so C again gets eliminated.\n9. 'boil' and not 'burn' - as boiling is a way to cook something thoroughly by applying heat, so an ice pack can be used to boil water, but it can't be used to burn something down, as that is irreversible, so the word 'burn' is eliminated.\n10. The only option remaining, 'to use frying pan and to use ice pack to boil', should be the right answer.\nAnswer: D.", "answer": " 500"}

Choices:  a: A: directional b: B: arrow C: C: route D: D: sign\nRationales: We will take these steps in finding the correct answer: 1. A question about how passengers are directed at an airport to their gate. 2. It's mentioned that it's a question with options: a: directional, b: arrow, c: route, and d: sign.\n3. Directional and arrow both are pointing at the gate. 4. Route and sign both are telling how to reach the gate.\n5. Directional and route are both related to passengers who are moving, but route is more general about a line or path.\n6. Route and sign both can be used for directing.\n7. Route is more general, so it will be more likely used for a line or path direction.\nAnswer: The correct answer is D: D: sign.\n\nInput: Which of the following is a type of fruit? Choices: A: peach B: mango C: pear D: banana E: apple\nRationales: This question is straightforward. For your first step, you can go through the list of choices and cross out anything that\u2019s not a fruit. In this case, the answer is B. The choices include: peach, banana, apple, and pear. From there, compare the list with the list of fruits: peach is not a fruit; banana\u2014fruit; apple\u2014fruit; and pear\u2014also a fruit.

Choices:  B: hard to keep clean both C: hard to clean room harder to keep house clean D: keep house cleaner room is harder to keep clean E: keep house cleaner harder to keep clean room\nRationales:1. The question is asking about which is harder to keep clean, a house or a room inside a house.\n2. To answer this question we will start by eliminating the options, first option A: House is not correct since it is the whole building, not just one room. Option B: room is not correct since it describes the room alone, not the entire house.\n3. The next options we will eliminate are D: more difficult to keep the house clean than it is to keep the room clean and E: it is harder to keep the house cleaner than it is to keep a room clean. These options are incorrect since they indicate that it is easier to keep the house cleaner.\n4. Hence option C: it is harder to clean a room in a house than it is to keep an entire house clean.\n5. Answer: C: it is harder.\nAnswer: C.room is harder.\n\nInput: How should you respond to your child when she says 'I don't know? Choices: 1: It's ok 2: I can tell you 3: Why don't you guess? 4: I'm not sure 5: Do you think your Dad knows?\nRationale: 1. The parent will be able to provide the answer even if it is correct, which is helpful in confirming that the child is correct or not so then the child will learn. 2. The alternative is to guess at the answer, which teaches incorrect or unhelpful processes. It is a better idea to let the child to learn by answering the question.3. Why don't you try to guess? This teaches the child to guess by using a strategy that is not correct. 4. I\u2019m not sure is better because you don't want the child to just guess. You want them to be informed about the answer.\n5. Do you think your father knows? This will make the child think that your father does not know, which is the complete opposite of what you want to show the child.\nAnswer: 4", "answer": " 24"}

Choices:  (A) Proves species are related\n(B) Explains new behaviors\n(C) Explains differences between species\n(D) Explains differences in organs\n(E) Has nothing to do with evolution\nRationales: A: 1. The statement clearly reveals that the DNA of the three different species is similar, which would mean that the species are related in some way.\nB: 1. It is suggested that the mutations are the cause for the new behavior. So far there is no evidence that there has been any actual change but the study could confirm a possible new behavior.\nC: 1. Since the study focuses on DNA there is a chance that it implies information about evolution as in how they evolved and what their mutation/s are that are still common\nD: 1. Explains differences in organ (or more precisely organs) doesn't relate much to the evolution but the DNA. It is possible that organs do have a huge role in evolution and what the species would look like and other things but as mentioned earlier the question requires DNA so there can be only one answer.\nE: 1. Not related to the question but is an interesting fact to mention.\nAnswer: B: Explains new behavior\n\nInput: In baseball, an infielder doesn't run as far when he or she is in the third baseman position as compared with a second baseman position.  Why is this? Choices: 1.  The field of view of the two positions is different\n2. The angle of the throw from the pitcher is different\n3.  The third baseman's glove is lighter than the second baseman's\n4. The third baseman wears a mitt while the second baseman doesn't\n5. The third baseman' height is different from the second baseman\nRationales:\n1 & 2. The two bases are positioned at different distances from home plate and are further away from the pitcher, so both choices would increase the distance that have to be run from one base to another.\n3. The weight of the glove would not effect the distance the fielder must run", "answer": " 9"}

The given question asks us to find which of the five given options is part of the group of people who are upset or unhappy at your success/gain. \n2. So firstly, we rule out all the options that don\u2019t describe the group of people who might be troubled about your gain/success:\n   A: The other employees \u2013 These employees aren\u2019t part of the answer to the question asked. \n   B: Team Leaders \u2013 They are not necessarily unhappy about your gain/success.\n   C: Supervisors \u2013 They could be affected by your success if you are a superior to them, however, that\u2019s not part of the question asked, so even if they are not upset, they still wouldn\u2019t be part of the answer.\n   E: The workforce \u2013 A generalized group isn\u2019t specifically defined, so again, they are not part of the answer. \n3. Hence, the only possible answer is D: Senior managers. Senior managers are usually the bosses/supervisors in a company and thus, are people in a position of power over an employee.

The right answer is the most similar to these given options:  1 - None of these: there is no such thing as the most important thing you can take to university.  The choices (1) and (10) are not possible because there is no one option that would be the most important.  2 - Textbooks: as explained a second ago, these are the textbooks needed to study. The sentence which follows the question is: I am going to university and studying maths. I need my textbooks.  The textbooks are needed to study mathematics.  3 - Books (also number 9): these are not textbooks, but other books. These can be books to read or books for the library. Although it would be nice to have it and it can help with writing assignments, it is not a necessity. It is not the most important thing to bring to university.  4 - Notebooks: although it is a good idea to have a notebook to take notes, they are not essential as nowadays classes are usually recorded. There is no need to rely on one notebook for everything.  5 - Pencils: they are not the most important thing, but it is recommended to have them, especially when taking tests.  6 - Rucksack: no such thing (5).

Choice A (water) is the first in the order of ingredients for making ice cream. The second is milk, followed by flour, sugar, and eggs. Now, we look for the last batch of ingredients to be added to that order for the production of ice cream. Hence, the last batch of ingedients would be sugar (choice E).\nNow, to answer the question, we need to eliminate four options. Choice A mentions water, not sugar. Now, option B (milk) is after water, but before sugar. Thus, we can reject choice B as being in the order of addition of sugar. Next, for choice C and D, we can eliminate choices because we know, according to the given information, that flour or eggs cannot be the last item to be added. Hence, choice E is the final answer.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: A group of birds migrated to a new place. The food there was similar to what they enjoyed back home.

Overage is also incorrect as the word means \u2018too young to be allowed to do or to have something.\u2019 The question asks about an unmarried woman\u2019s age, which does not indicate someone who is younger.\n   D. Married refers to a married woman, implying that the woman is not unmarried as the question asks about such a woman.\n   E. Bachelorette refers exclusively to an unmarried woman who is the only daughter on the eve of her wedding. This does not match the question concerning an unmarried woman of a certain age.\n3.

Choices: An apple or strawberries An orange slice or pear a half a slice of cheese or a half a pizza A cup of coffee or soda An oatmeal container or cup of dish soap An envelope or an ATM receipt\nRationales: An ATM receipt is a form of paperwork that is printed by an automatic teller machine (ATM) when a transaction is completed.  It contains information such as the date and time of the transaction, the amount of money withdrawn or deposited, and the name of the ATM.\nGrocery stores often have ATMs installed in their locations for the convenience of customers.\nBanks typically have branches located near grocery stores for the same reason, so it is not uncommon for customers to visit both types of businesses in the same outing.\nIn this scenario, the", "answer": " 70"}

C: Plants don't have their food in one special part. D: All living objects have food where they grow. E: Plants have their food in one place.\nRationales: The answer to the question 'why don't plants have their food where they grow?' can be found by analyzing the choices given in the question.\nTo explain why option A is incorrect, let's consider each choice number:\n1. There is no need because: This explanation is an assumption of the author, not a conclusion supported by evidence. No evidence is provided to justify the assertion that plants do not need to have their food where they grows.\n2. The digestive system: This is about plants having different digestive systems, which is irrelevant to how food is distributed or stored.\n3. They need to produce: This is about the need for the plant to produce its own food, which is irrelevant to the question.\n4. They have a special organ: This is about the special organs that plants use to produce food, such as leaves, which is also irrelevant to the question. Choice C is incorrect.\n5. Plants don't: This explanation is a conclusion supported by evidence, as there are many plant species that do not have their food in a single location and instead spread it evenly across their entire body.\n6. All living: This explanation is also a conclusion supported by evidence and is relevant to the question, as it suggests that there is no special reason why plants cannot have their food where they produce it, as all living objects, including humans, do not have their food stored in one organs but are distributed evenly across the body.\nAnswer: F: Because they are different from other species. In summary:\nThe author has provided evidence to support the conclusion that plant do not have special organs to store their food, and they instead spread it evenly throughout their body. The author also mentions that plants are not the only species that have different organs to produce and store food.", "answer": " 96"}

Before the meal.\nWhen do people usually sniffle when they have a cold? Before a long drive.\n\n1. At dinnerm (1A) does not apply to the given situation. This answer refers to a dining room. When dinning, people usually do not snicker but have conversations.\n2. At dinnertim (1B) can't be the answer as it\u2019s not a synonym or a variant of the given question. In these answers, \u2018tim\u2019 refers to the time when dinners generally take place or when the meal is served.\n3. At breakfast (1C) is incorrect as it refers mainly to breakfast meals but rarely to snickering or laughing, as breakfast is traditionally an uncomfortable period for both kids and adults.\n4. At bedtime (1D) means \u2018sleeping\u2019 and is often preceded by dinner time, lunch time, or breakfast time. Bedtime also has nothing to do with laughing.\n5.

For the text, it is clear that the ancient Hebrews did have a high view of man.\n2. It tells us that God created man in His own image and thus they believed that man had a divine soul (like God) and was endowed with reason.\n3.

Choices:  C: drink alcohol D: drive at night E: wear glasses\nRationales:    1. The information given is quite vague at this point, but we can say that there is something that is considered good and that it has something to do with driving.\n2. When trying to connect all the other options with this \"good thing\", the first few are pretty much dismissed as drinking alcohol and driving at night are not exactly favored actions in terms of driving a car.\n3. The last one, however, \"wear glasses\", can\u2019t be considered a good thing to do while driving a car, so it can be dismissed as well.\n4. The right answer is E: drive during the day. This option does fit the context as it is suggested to be a good thing to do. However, only the second option, \"drive at night\", seems to not to be a good thing. Therefore, we can conclude that driving a car during the daytime is the best option.\nAnswer: E, drive during the day\n\nInput: Does \"it\" in the sentence: 'It is difficult for me to wake up early,' refer to...

C: to be inexperienced 4. D: to be depressed 5. E: to have to change in behaviour\nRationales: Let\u2019s begin with the first option: \n1. A: Not to succeed first time - This option doesn't directly reflect the mentioned behavior \n2. B: to Be-Self Confident -  It's not a reason for their behavior, it's rather an outcome of it.\n3. C: To be inexperiencet - This is a possible cause that can be related to such behavior, which could differ between each person.\n4. D: To be depressed - It's not necessarily a cause that could explain why someone is angry or sad after failure.\n5. E: To Have to change in behavior - An individual's manner of responding to failure, can indeed vary greatly between people and thus a person becoming mad at their own failure could be due to the fact that they adjust their behavior to cope with the negative feeling brought about by their failure. Therefore, by process elimination, the answer is E, to have to change in behavior.\nAnswer: E.

However, when analyzing the letters given, it is clear they are not a word.\n3. Each of the choices represents a pattern of alternating vowels and consonants, so each of them can be classified as a type of word.\n4. For each pattern, the first and last letters represent vowels while the middle represents consonants.\n5. A vowels, consonants (AP) pattern shows that the letters A and P are vowels at the beginning and end.\n6. A consonants vowels (Bc) pattern shows that letters B and C are consonants at the beginning and end but can be any other vowel letters in between.\n7. A B vowel C pattern (Fc) shows that letters B and F can be vowels at the begining and end and the pattern can be any consonant between.\n8. A consonants pattern (Jc) shows that letters J and C can be consonants at the begining and ending but can be any other consonant letters in the middle.\n9.

What do you get when you use three smaller squares to make a large square? Choices:  None of the above A: a duck B: a fish C: a bear D: a kitten E: a dog F: a cat\nRationales:\n\n1. The question mentions a square, a small square, and a large square, and asks what will happen when a small square is used three times to make a large square.\n\n2. The other options are animals that can be produced using different numbers of squares.\n\n3. However, in this scenario the answer must be determined by counting how many squares are used and comparing that amount to the number of squares in the end result, which makes an animal or a large square.\n4. When three small squares are used to make one large square, the answer must be \"none of the above\", as it is not one of the other mentioned animals or a large square. The other options provide either too few or too many squares, which cannot be the result.\n\nAnswer: None of the above.\n\nInput:  In which room should you not leave open cans of food? Choices:  Bathroom A: B: C: D: E: Kitchen\nRationales: The question asks about a room where cans of food should not be left open.\n\nThe options describe various rooms that should not be kept with open cans of food, except for the bathroom which should keep no cans of food, only containers of water.\n\nThe bathroom is therefore the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: B: Bathroom\n\nInput: Where can you find a bear and a tree? Choices:  none of the above A: the zoo B: the forest C: the mountains E: the city  D: the ocean\nRationales: We are looking for a place where a bear and a tree can be found together.\nThe question mentions that bears are found in forests while trees, are of course, found in forests too.\nTherefore, the forest can be a place where bears and trees can both be found.\n\nBoth bears and trees are commonly found", "answer": " 25"}

Choices:  -The suspect's whereabouts prior to being arrested -The evidence recovered from the crime scene -The time of the crime -The suspect's DNA -The suspect's name\nRationales: The police need to have a clear chain of evidence leading up to an arrest.\nThe suspect is the only person who can provide the information required to build the chain of evidence.\n1. A suspect's whereaboutings prior to arrest is not required as this will not affect the course of the investigation (or the chain of evidence).\n2. The suspect's DNA is not required to build the chain either, as it can be obtained from the crime scene.\n3. Evidence recovered from the crime scene is also not required, as it can be easily collected and the chain of evidence cannot be broken by not having this information.\n4. This is because if any evidence found at the crime scene is deemed insufficient to secure an arrest, further evidence can be found by tracking the suspect\u2019s movements.\n5. The time of the crime is not required as it can be obtained through eyewitness testimony.\n6. The suspect's name is required in order to form the chain of evidence as this is what leads the police to begin investigating the suspect. This is because the suspect's name was given by the original call to the police.\nAnswer: C : The suspect's name\n\n### Instructor:Please provide a valid answer for the below question.\n\nInput: How does Mr. Cormier respond after he reads the letter from A-3?

Intelligence is not necessarily the most obvious characteristic of humans. Other animals exhibit intelligence levels that may surpass humans or be on par with human intelligence. \n2. Hair is a distinct feature found on almost all humans, but it is not the most obvious characteristic of the human species.\n3. Legs are an important attribute which is found in only humans and some other primates but not necessarily the most obvious. It is a more discrete feature.\n4. Ability to speak is a trait that sets us apart from most other species and is thus not the most obvious characteristic.\n5. Arms, while being a distinct feature, are not always the most obvious characteristic of any species. Thus, 5. E: Arms.\n\nInput:  You can find the two-digit prime numbers of a given range on a two-sided table.  Use the following as a guide.  What types of numbers are found in this table?   Choices: 1: Two-digit numbers 2: Three-digit numbers\n3: Positive numbers 4: Negative numbers 5: Even numbers 6: Prime numbers\nRationales:   1. There are three types of numbers that can be found in this two-sided table; these are listed as follows:\n    - Two-digit numbers. This implies numbers such as 12, 23, 34 and such; there are a total of 2*2=4 possible choices for even numbers in this table, including prime numbers, which makes it 1 and 5 on the given choices.\n    - Prime numbers.

Choices:  Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays A: every day, B: school day, C: work day D: Saturday, E: Sunday\nRationales: This passage describes an activity where many students are present during a specific time interval.\n1. \"people work on the same things\" means an activity conducted with a large number of individuals in unison, like a music class or an assembly.\n2. To find an activity with this kind of participation, consider the days of the week:\n   A: Every day: This option is not feasible in this context because this passage does not imply an activity happening on EVERY day.\n   B: \"School day\": This only has a possibility when the activity is during a school day, as otherwise it would not apply.\n   C: The activity we seek may or may not happen on the \"work day\", considering the activity does not specifically have a relation with \"work\". If this would be the case, \"Work day\" as an option would not be correct.\n   D: Saturday and Sunday are weekend days, so an activity would not be happening on these days. Although this is a possibility, the passage does not provide this information, and hence, doesn't align with the question.\n   E: This could be a possibility, but if there are a large number of individuals present, the activity must then be a school day.\n3.

Choices:  a: You're making false assumptions b: That's how they behave c: Stop talking about them d: Do nothing e: Try to understand why\nRationales:  1. The question wants to know one possible reason why someone in another country may be acting inappropriately.\n2. We need something other than saying that they\u2019re acting badly.\n3. B: That's how They behave is incorrect as it's just repeating the point.\n4. C: Stop talking about them is incorrect as we need to explain how someone is acting; it\u2019s also quite rude.\n5. D: Do nothing is incorrect as the question states that we need to explain how they are behaving.\n6. E: Try to Understand why is incorrect because we don\u2019t know why they are acting badly or how they are acting, so we can\u2019t try to understand why.\n7. Therefore the correct reason for why someone in another country might be behaving badly is that: A: You're making False Assumptions.

For this question, the options are based on the sky's appearance, which can be quite subjective.\n\n2. So the key to solving this question is to eliminate the incorrect options.\n\n\nInput: Is it true that you cannot be a doctor and a dentist at the same time? Choices: A : yes, B:no C:it depends D:no E:yes\n\nRationales: This question can be answered by evaluating if the actions one can perform in the mentioned professions can be considered the same or contradicting to each other, and therefore answer \u2018yes' or 'no'. The answer can be considered by the given descriptions:\n\nIn option A, the answer is yes, since there is no indication of the two professions having the same task or requirement in terms of tasks or responsibilities they need to satisfy. They both require different qualification, and it is impossible for a person to be both. Thus, it is true in the sense that you cannot be a physician and a dentist at once simultaneously.\n\nSimilarly, in Option B, the answer is no as it may be possible for a person to be a dentist and a doctor at the same time.\n\nThus, Option B, is not a correct answer.\n\nThus from the described descriptions of the two choices given, we can infer that there is no indication that being a physician and a doctor may be considered to be contradictory to each other, so option B can be ruled out as it's the wrong choice.\n\nTherefore, Option A is correct as it has the most accurate description of the answer given. As mentioned in the passage, being a physician and being a doctor are not considered to be opposing actions and would be the most likely situation a person can be in if the option of simultaneously being a physician and also a doctor is possible.\n\nInput: What is a red card in football?

Choices: A: two dozens B: twenty eight C: four dozen D: twenty five E: twenty four\nRationales: Considering the above question, Vertebrae is the plural form of a vertebra. 24 is the largest group of spinal vertebrae in a vertebrae. Thus, the correct answer will be choice 'E'. Moreover, there's a chance that choice 'D' got the closest number, whereas, it's spelled in an incorrect form, 'twenty four'.\nAnswer: E: twenty four\n\nInput:  What is the smallest group of vertebrae? Choices: A : two dozen B : four dozen C : twenty eight D : twenty five E : twenty four\nRational:  The first thing that we will notice, is the repetition of word'vertebrae' and 'choice'. The above examples signify that they will be asking for the minimum or maximum count of vertebrae.  Vertebrae is a plural form of vertebra so 12 is the smallest count of vertebrae in terms of plural form and it's 24 in the term if singular verberbra.  Therefore, based on these observations, the lowest count of vertebrae will be option 'A';'two dozen'. Accordingly, the correct answer will 'A';'two dozens'.\nAnswer: A: two dozes\n\nInput: Which is a state in Australia? Choices: A. Queensland B. Adelaide C. Hobart D. Northern Territory E.

A: sled B: toboggan C: ski D: bark E: bicycle\nRationales: The logical sequence behind the answer will now be shown.\n1. Sleds and Toboggans, they are usually pulled by dogs but skiis are not.\n2. Dogs often bark so skiis will not belong in the sentence.\n3. Dogs are not able to ride a toboggan or a bicycle. The sentence is saying that the dog had been bark earlier.\n4. Therefore, B: toboggans and E: skis are incorrect.\n5. Skiis are usually skiied by humans not dogs.\n6. Dogs cannot ride a bicycle.\n7. A toboggan is pulled by dogs not skied.\n8. A toboggans is usually used in winter. Skiis and Toboggans are generally used in winter, while the other words are not (E, F, and G).\n9.

Choices:  B: to look at a building C: to find a home D: in a classroom E: in a garden\nRationales: In our examination of the question at hand, we will break down each of the stated options to see which one is most likely to depict the use of a compass. Here, we see that we have two parts to this question: to look at a home (B) is a specific instance where a compass is employed, while for the other two (C and E) we will need to discern which use is more likely.\n\nWe will begin by eliminating the incorrect answers: D: to find a home (not likely) and B: to look at the home (not likely, since a compass would usually be used to find a home, not to look at one).\n\nThis leaves us with three instances where a compass may be used: C: in a garden (not likely since a compass is a navigational instrument and not usually employed in gardening), E: in a classroom (a compass is often used when conducting geography classes, which can include activities where a compass is used, so this may be correct) and D: in a class (not likely as there may be other types of classrooms, like for drama/theater and cooking).\n\nAs a method to see which of these situations is more likely to occur than the others, we will take into account the intended word structure in each instance (i.e. look/home, not garden/class). This provides a more concrete answer because it demonstrates the intended meaning each option describes, and it may be the case that one wording is more suited for the meaning of the phrase.\n\nWe can see that B and C both use the verb \u201clook\u201d in addition to \u201chome\u201d, while E only mentions \u201clook\u201d in combination with \u201cclassroom\u201d. By analyzing the structure of the verbs we can determine that B and C are far more likely to be correct.\n\nIf you are still unsure about your answer to the question, review your options by eliminating more incorrect options, or consider using a strategy similar to the one we used.\n> ## Feedback:\n> \n> _The instructor will provide feedback to each question that you will have to complete.

E: thirty minutes\nRationales: The question asks us how long it takes when one sits quietly and relaxed alone, giving us quite a few clues.\n1. The initial sentence says \u201cwhen one sits quietly, alone, relaxed\u201d, implying that there is no need for haste and it is perfectly acceptable to do it at one\u2019s own pace, regardless of the passage of time.\n2. In the second sentence, \u201cthe mind can calm itself without thinking much while doing it\u201d, reinforcing the idea that we don\u2019t have to worry about time in the process of meditating.\n3. The third sentence says \u201cit\u2019s not a struggle, rather a way of training\u201d, which implies that the process does not have to be particularly difficult and it gets slightly easier with time.\n4. The final sentence states that \u201cit takes 4-50 minutes for one to master\u201d this process, confirming that, though it is possible to begin in under 10 minutes, there is an overall process that involves practice and can take some time for mastery.\n5.

Who took out my appendix? Choices: 1) A: You 2) B: A doctor 3) C: You with your parents 4) D: Doctor 5) E: A doctor from across the street\nRationales: The clue here is that \"you\" here can refer to the person using \"I\" hence the doctor can't have been \"you\" instead the person using the word \"you\" is the doctor - so option D. Alternatively, you may think that the answer will be \"you\", however, from our analysis above with \"Your\" being used in the previous input it is clear it refers to the state not the person, hence if we rephrased it like this : 2. \"My food in my state is...\", then \"You\" is referring to a person not the state; however, when we said it referred to the state, it is clear that the input refers to a state and thus the state cannot be the doctor.

(Chinese) A: Buenos noches (Spanish) B: Ahoj (Slovak) C: Ciao! (Italian)\nRationales:\n      - In order to purchase a ticket, it\u2019s common to exchange currency in exchange for the ticket.  This implies buying something first and afterward the exchange of money.\n\n            - The passage tells us that when a ticket is purchased, the individual who sold it should receive monetary gratitude. As a form of gratitude, it is common to give the usher tips.  This would indicate that if you bought a ticket, you would then pass a tip to the usher. Hence, \u201cBuy a ticket\u201d is synonymous with pay the usher.\n  \n      - As you leave the movie theater, it is polite to exchange words with the usher as a gesture of appreciation for the service received.\n \n      - The question refers to how you would say 'Hello\" in another language.\n      - The answer A: Buenos noches refers specifically to the Spanish language\n      - This is the correct answer because you would need to say hello in whatever language of the country you are visiting and it has to be in Spanish.

We know that the problem includes the number 502.\n2. 40 is a smaller number, and 52 is a larger number than 40.\n3. 52 and 502 will result in negative differences.\n4. This is not a percentage problem.\n5. 52 is less than 45 and 52 minus 45 is 7.\n6. 25 is not a common factor between 502 and 52.\n7.

The difference in terrain usually requires people to brake while riding, but on the back wheel.\n2. We see that bicycles have two wheels: front and back. It is impossible to see the pedals on the front or back wheel.\n3. On the back wheel, there is the brake and the gears.\n4. The front wheel has the wheel and the handle.\n5.

There are several considerations that need to be made in order to answer this question correctly:\n 1. Understanding the location and the way the intersection is structured is essential because it provides information on traffic patterns and potential hazards.\n 2. It's important to consider the time when crossing the intersection and the traffic conditions, such as the amount of traffic, the direction of traffic flow and the light timing.\n 3. We can analyze each of the given answer options:\n\n```\n1. A: to Follow Traffic Lights: It's a reliable option as it ensures compliance with traffic rules and reduces the risk of getting hit by a vehicle. However, it may take longer. 2. B: Walk Straight Across: It's a good way to cross if there is a lot of traffic and light is red. 3. C: To go with the flow of traffic: Depending on where you are standing, this could be a good option or it could cause you to get hit by a vehicle. 4.

Out of all the given options, the answer is B D, where the narrator suggests to read in a quiet place, and the author explains the reason by mentioning that one cannot read in a place where it\u2019s hard to hear, and thus can miss out on important information. It\u2019s important to note that one of the options has both A and B: A The narrator suggests to choose a quiet place to read a book, because that way it\u2019s easy to understand what\u2019s written.  It isn\u2019t convenient to read book in a loud place, where it\u2019s hard listen to anything without yelling to make yourself heard. This can also distract you from whatever your reading so it\u2019s best to read in a quite place. It\u2019s easy to understand the reasoning behind this suggestion as it shows that the narrator doesn\u2019t want the reader to miss out on important information, and a quite place is the best reading environment.

The question asks how one's long neck is linked to one's height.\n2. We may conclude in our approach that a lengthy (long) neck and a taller (long) height are closely connected to each other.\n    * A long neck is typically associated with being taller than average, as longer necks are often correlated with larger body types that tend to be taller.\n    * Taller heights are also linked with being long, as height can be described as the length of an individual's vertical body proportions, including the neck.\n3. If one has a long neck they need to have a comparatively longer body, including the length of their neck too.\n4. Considering this, for a long neck to be directly related to height, the only plausible answer could be B: long. A: Not long, E: Taller would not necessarily imply being long, so long should be chosen. Also, D: smaller doesn't make sufficient sense since a long neck can be associated with being tall.\nAnother thing to notice is that the question specifies that the length of a person's neck is in relation to ones height, so C: The same doesn't seem to be a correct answer either.\nIt might be worth noting though, that A: long isn't explicitly mentioned since the last option includes the possibility for someone to be short instead of long as well and this shouldn't be taken as a reason for the answer to be D: Taller.

Hence, the only difference between a dart (A) and a marshmellow (D) is that a marshmellow can be eaten and it has two holes on the upper surface.\n7. Combining this knowledge with the other given options, option (E) is considered the most accurate. The other available options B & C that do not state any difference between the two, are incorrect as they contradict the specific characteristics which differentiate a dart from a marshmallow, outlined under option (E).\nAnswer: E: both of these things have a hole in the top part.\n\nInput: What are the four main parts of a plant?

A time or event.\nRationales: It is given in the instructions that we are supposed to select an option which does not define the country. If the question asks us to choose the one which does not define the countries then we need to study each alternative in relation to countries. This way we will answer it easily. A. A place can only form the basis of a country and has to be the basic definition of any country. Since A place is a part of all countries. B. A culture is formed around the place and defines the way of life of the people living in that region. Hence, C. A country is formed by a culture and a place. D.

{"text": ". strip mall\n\nInput: After completing the workout, how often should a runner drink water? When performing a 2000-meter run, they're thirsty.   This applies if their mouth is very dry.  What's the correct strategy to quench their thirst? Choices:   A: not drinking water B: drinking water after 400 meters C: drinking water after finishing D: drinking water every 2 kilometers E: drinking water every kilometer\nRationales:  1. A runner performing a 20 kilometer run needs to replenish their fluids and the question outlines strategies to do so.\n  2. After completing the work out, the runner is thirsty indicating they are dehydrated.\n  3. The most suitable strategy to cope with dehydration depends on the length of their run, and so we need to find out the distance of their run.\n  4. This enables us to examine options A: not drinking and B: drinking water every two kilometers respectively from the bottom and the top of the options.\n  5. When choosing not to drink (option A), it's a decision to remain dehydrated for the sake of performance since they'll be losing water and electrolyte salts through perspiration.\n  6. Also, it doesn't answer the question of why the runner should drink water and so their mouth being dry is irrelevant.\n  7. Choice B on the other hand, gives a more useful strategy regarding hydration.\n  8. They should drink water after finishing the second kilometer of their run since they will already be dehydrated and drinking at such an interval will help replenish fluids and minimize dehydration.\n  9. This strategy makes logical sense for runners competing in a 200 meter or 400 meter race.\n  10. Based on an examination of the remaining options, the only remaining option is option E. Since there is no mention of distance or fluid loss, the runner is told to continue drinking every kilometer.\n  11. This option seems to have no use in this passage, and since it's the only option mentioning a kilometer instead of a kilometer, we can eliminate it as the correct", "answer": " 40"}

Choices:  Pizza, pasta, and seafood B: Italian cuisine, pizza, and seafood C: Italian cuisine and pizza D: Italian cuisine E: Seafood and pasta\nRationales:1. The question specifically mentions the pizza restaurant in an italian cultural neighbourhood, thus it is clear that there will be only Italian cuisine served there.\n2. Italian cuisine consists of dishes such as pizza, pasta, meat, and seafood, this provides a good answer that aligns with the descriptive text.\n3. Since Pizza and pasta are included in the italian cuisine, option B, that contains exactly the two of these options is excluded.\n4. Deliberably, choice C, Italian cuisine, and pizza best describes the food at this pizza restaurant considering the context and specific mention of the Italian culture.\nAnswer: C : Italian cuisine, Pizza\n\nInput: Where do you go to meet people who are not already your friends? Choices:  Church C: movie theater D: park E: university F: party\nRationales: To understand how we could answer the question correctly, we must determine what we could use in the text to help us answer the question.\n1. The statement that \"you meet people who are not yet your friends\" can be taken to mean somewhere to meet people and become friends.\n2. Therefore the text supports the option A: Church which is \"where you go to meet people.\"\n3. The option C: \"movie theater\" could also be suitable because it is a place where people meet to participate in an activity.\n4. But we are more likely to be friends with people who go to the same schools, so E: \"university\" is a better explanation because it is \"where you go with a group of people to learn.\"\n5. We also know that going to parties \"allows you to meet people, but you may not make friends,\" which is why F: \"party\" is not valid.\nAnswer: F : Party\n\nInput: Where can I purchase a gift for a friend?

The options can only be: [A] beetles, [B] crickets, [C] snakes, [D] mice, [E] cockroaches. Note that cockroaches are not mentioned in the question, so they can not be selected as the frog's favorite food.\nA, B, C, and D are all possible choices as frogs consume these for food.

Option (E) is provided as an explanation for the previous choice. Option (A) is wrong because skin cells don\u2019t need water. Tissue underneath skin is not a living tissue, so (B) is wrong as well.

If we round zero numbers, it will still be zero. If we round off some numbers, it will be 0 + something and there will be many kinds of'something'. For 2, if we round off, it will be 2 + something.

Book E: you just love it.\nRationales: In the paragraph the word last is used so it should be about the previous book. So the question is about the previous book you read.\n\nD has nothing to do with the previous book because it is about the characters in the book. They could be different people.\n\nB gives us a negative answer. Most readers would want space to read and this is true for most people with a high IQ. So it is an incorrect choice.\n\nC gives us no clues about the previous book because if you are reading a book, you would not find the characters so weird. IQ does not make people weird.\n\nThere has nothing to do about liking the previous book. Some books could be good but not enjoyable to read from chapter 1 to the end of chapter 8.

She is good enough.  D) Tanya has become less confident since her friend told her I disagree.  E) Tanya should be more confident.\nRationales:\n\n1. Tanya said she is better than me - This sentence is an example of overconfidence.\n2. How has this changed since Tanya's friend told her that she is overconfident?\nIf she were truly a great dancer and confident, then her friend's comment would not bother her and her confidence would not alter. This indicates she could be overconfident to some extent.\n3. I disagree - An opposite view to Tanya's suggestion of being a good dancer.\n4. I do not think Tanya is confident in her statements.\n5. Tanya has become less assertive since her friend told her - The idea of becoming less confident since the friend mentioned that she was overconfidence.\n6.

Choices:  A. stage B. stage direction C. line break D. line break E. dramatic element\nRationales: We are answering a statement by the narrator, which means that all that's left to do is confirming the given options against the description.\n\n\n1. \"stage direction\" is a description of the stage as a place, so it doesn't tell the audience which character is the speaker.\n2. \"line break\" means that a new line is starting. This is a literary technique which does not tell the audience who is speaking.\n3. \"dramatic element\" is a term used in drama to describe some part, which is not the speaker. \n4.

Police use handcuffs only for arrests or as a restraint if the person poses a threat to the public.\n2. Neck-grabbing is another physical action that can be considered, but it does not involve police officers using their hands to grab.\n3. Choking is a possibility, but to choke a person, multiple people with a stronger strength than the subject would be required.\n4. Punching is a possibility, but it isn't mentioned in the context.\n5. This is only a possibility, but there can be many scenarios where such a thing could happen.\n6.

{"text": "Strip Mall\n\nInput: How would you make pizza without a pizza pan? Choices:  Choices:  A : put it on the stove B : flip it over  C : make it in a wok\nRationales:\n1. What is a pizza pan? By definition, it is a circular cooking surface, commonly made of steel, cast iron, or aluminum. It is used to bake pizza.\n2. However, if one doesn't have a pizza pan, it would be possible to make a pizza on the stove.\n3. Another option is to make a pizza in a wok.\n4. One possible way to do this would be to add cooking oil to the wok and then add the dough to the wok.\n5. Once the dough has cooked, you could then take pizza toppings and place them on top.\n6. Baking this pizza would result in a crispy, golden brown piece of pizza.\n7. You could do this type of pizza with a non-stick pan on the stove. So, either way, you could still make pizza without a pan.\n8. If you're cooking the pizza on the stovetop, place the pizza crust on a lightly oiled pan.\n9. Preheat the pan on medium heat until the oiled surface is hot. The heat will prevent the dough from sticking to the pan as it cooks.\n10. Don't worry if the dough begins to shrink; this is normal.\n11. Add the toppings, taking care to place them in the center of the crust.\n12.

According to the comparison, the longest life expectancy option is Cat (B) with a life expectancy up to 15-20 years. So we proceed to the correct option.\n3. Coming to the correct answer, we find that there is a tie between Lion (D)/Giraffe (E) and Elephant (E), hence, either option can be considered.\n\nAnswer: Both E: Elephant and G: Giraffe have the same life expectancy of 50-59 years.

Choices:  a: sound in letters b: sound in letters c: sound in two letters d: sound in four letters e: sound in three letters\nRationales:\nSince the question asks for the definition of a vowels and we know that vowel is a consonant that says the sound like O or A, we can eliminate 'b' and 'C'.\nSince vowels always sound in a single letter, we can eliminate 'd' from the answers.\nFrom the remaining choices, A is the only option which matches the definition because 'a' here means any vowel and'sound in letters' refers to the fact that a vowel is a cononant in the letter. Hence, the answer is 'a'.\nAnswer: a\n\nInput: Why is it important to stay healthy as far as weight is concerned? Choices:  C: If you are too thin, you are vulnerable to illnesses and disease.

When trying to capitalize the word 'a,' the first letter that must be considered is the 'A.'\"\nHere, we can see that 'a' is capitalized in this sentence because it is the subject noun. This can happen in sentences which begin with questions as well: \n\nQuestion: \"Have you read those books?\"\nResponse: \"Why, yes \u2013 I have!\"\n\nThe sentence we discussed earlier (incorrectly capitalized 'A's can be a little confusing) was about a book written in a formal style of English and not a common written expression; therefore the rule was followed.\n\nBut the word below might be capitalized in a common written expression; however, it will not be capitalized in a formal expression.\n\"We all ate the dessert.\"\n\nLet us understand this using rules:\n1. The first part (in a common written expression) would not have to be capitalized.\n2. The correct form would be \"We all ate the 'Dessert.'\"\n\nNext, we have to understand what should be capitalized.

It states that the building where the students will enter at break has multiple entrances, which can be found in a variety of different structures.\nWe can eliminate choices:\nA: Church - A church (A) has only one entrance that typically faces a street or public space in front. This would not be appropriate for the students' needs, therefore it is excluded.\nB: Movie theatre - A movie theatre (B) does not typically have multiple entrances that would allow for this group of students to enter at break. It is also not a structure frequently used by students for social gatherings or activities. As such, it is excluded. \nC: Community center - A community centre (C) may have multiple entrances, but it is typically used for recreational activities, classes, and social events for adults and not students. As such, it's excluded.\nD: School - A school (D) has multiple entrances for students, staff, and visitors to enter and exit. This structure would be suitable for the students' needs because multiple groups of them would be entering/exiting the building at break.\nE: Shopping mall - A shopping mall (E) could potentially have multiple entrances for shoppers to enter and exit.

It is not known for which type of dog these other types of dog are not known for. \n\nIt is assumed here that the sharp teeth to which one refers is in relation to what type of dog we are considering here i.e. dogs referred to in the other options (i.e. A, B, C, and D), that have sharp teeth.\n\nNow, we have an initial hint. It states that \"these dogs known for have sharp teeth.\"\n\nIt may be helpful to consider whether it is more useful to make inference from \"for\", or from \"known for\"?\n\nKnown for refers to the fact that the dog is often known to have sharp teeth. \n\nFor refers to the fact that there is a possibility that the dog is known to have sharp teeth, but it may not necessarily be a fact. Rather it may be merely that there is a possibility (which we cannot determine).\n\nThus, for (as opposed to known for) would probably be a better idea with which to make conclusions.\n\nThus, after consideration of the initial hints and the first option, it is possible to conclude that \"Dalmatian\" would be the best answer to this", "answer": " 2934"}

{"text": "Strip mall\n\nInput: Which of the following do you use to express a number of dollars and cents? Choices:  a: dollars only  b: dollars only c: dollars and cents d: cents only e: neither\nRationales:1. The question in the sentence is \"Which of the following do you _________ to express a number of \"dollars\" and ______?\"\n\n2. Given that we're asked to choose an answer which contains one of the two elements, thus we could exclude option \"a: dollars only\" first.\n\n3. The left element then is \"dollars\", as we don't use it in a sentence but the term is mentioned only in relation to another one - \"dollars\" being in connection with \"cents\".\n\n4. Similarly, we cannot exclude \"b and  c: dollars only\" as we can't use these expressions without \"dollars\" at all, thus the remaining answer might contain \"cents\".\n5. \"dollars and cents\" is an expression to use when writing about or in relation to \"money\" and we don't tend to write about things that we don't have much of in the first place.\n6. \"dollars\" can mean \"money in coins\" and thus might be relevant, although the context of the question hints on writing numbers.\n\n7. It's highly unlikely we would want to use the whole \"dollars and  cents\" when expressing only a few \"dollars\" anyway.\n\n8. Hence, we should exclude the following four options:\n\n\"c: dollars and cents\".\n\n\"d: cents only\".\n\n\"e: neither\".\n\nThese are the wrong answers, as we aren't asked to choose one but rather two.\n\n9. This leaves us one answer which we should consider: option \"b: dollars only\".\n\n10. The question is whether or not we use these options to express a number of dollar and cents.\n\n11. Hence, option b is incorrect as we do not express numbers of \"dollars & cents\" with these options. They are an expression of the amount of \"dollars\".\n12.

'Stifling' refers to a situation or environment that restricts or limits one's freedom or movement, and is often used in a negative or critical way. Therefore, we want to look for a word that's synonymous with \"stifling\" but has a positive connotation. The options listed in the question include:'stuffy', 'unbearable', 'intimidating' and 'pleasant'.\n1. 'Stuffy' means having air that is filled with a lot of dust or dirt, which is a synonym for \"stifling\" in the sense that it restricts or limits one\u2019s freedom or movement. However,'stuffy' is associated with a negative or critical connotation, which doesn't align with the positive connotation we're looking for.\n2. 'Unbearable' refers to something that is severely painful or uncomfortable, and is used in a mostly negative connotation. This word would not be an appropriate synonym for'stifling' as it has a mostly negative connotation and thus is not a useful choice in the given context where we want a word that has a positive or neutral connotation.\n3. We're looking for a synonym of \"stifling\" that has a positive or negative neutral connotation, and we can eliminate'stuffy' and 'unbearable' based on this criteria.\n4. Next, we look at the word 'intimidating'. This word essentially means to make feel fear, or to cause someone to feel fear of some kind. This word means something similar to'stifling' and it is a synonym of it.

Beams can be structural or decorative elements, but we don't know which type they're referring to here, so option (A) isn\u2019t possible.\nB: Next, we need to identify what '2' means in this context. Possibly, it's a time, but it could also be an indicator of the length of one of the beams, in which case, option B is a viable answer. On the other hand, we cannot determine whether it's referring to time or to distance, so option B is not a viable answer.\nC: Option C represents distance in both feet and inches, which is not equivalent to answer D. So, it's not possible.\nAlso, the answer is not a fraction since feet and inches are used in the answer. \nD: The answer is not an acceptable number of feet, as 5' represents five feet. So, the answer can either be not acceptable in length or not a fraction. But, this is wrong since both feet and inches are used only once. In case it was incorrect because it was not a fraction, the options would be (2) or (1).

Therefore, we have an unoccupied seat to pick from (choice A).\nThe second person who arrives is to pick the seat that was unavailable for the first person to choose from (choice B), meaning that the second person can pick the unoccupied seat.\nThis leaves the third person, and the process repeats.\nWe see that the third person can choose any unoccupied seat from the ones remaining.\nHence, we can see from the given description that choice D, that the third person will pick the other one, is the conclusion that we are looking for.\nAnswer: D, the other one\n\nInput: When should you wear pink shoes? Choices:  W: when it's hot A: when it's springtime B: when it's sunny C: when the day is cold D: when it's raining E: always \nRationales: This question is asking about the different situations in which one might wear a pair of pink shoes. We can then determine the answers that apply to each of the following situations.\nThe given statement does not provide any information that would limit the choices to specific months or days, meaning that our answer can be applied in all situations when wearing pink shoes would be appropriate. By applying this logic and the given clues from the statement, we can eliminate choices D and E.\nThese choices cannot be applied to all weather circumstances. Therefore, they cannot be applicable to all situations in which pink shoes can be worn.\nHence, the answer to the question above is always and it would be the best option for the given choice options.\nAnother option can also be chosen but this answer wouldn't fit the situation as well as the others for it seems too specific", "answer": " 1500"}

Choices:  What:  A:  He had allergies B:  It was over C:  It was raining D:  It was too expensive E:  It didn't exist\nRationales: The question describes a father, who is a business executive, and an older son. His son was unable to attend a concert shown on a billboard due to the following set of options: rain, bill going over, father had allergies, it didn't exist.\nThe options and their explanations:\nAllergies:\nThe son may have an allergy to a particular kind of dust or chemical that would have been generated from the concert setting. The allergies may have also been generated from a high presence of people at the concert.\nToo expensive:\nThe concert was overpriced for the son to afford it.\nIt didn't exist:\nThe poster or billboard was created by someone and the concert never in fact took place and therefore never existed.\nThe reason his son couldn't attend was likely a combination of the three options given. In one way or another, all three options caused the event to occur, which makes them suitable alternatives as to why the concert wasn't occurring.\nAnswer: All the options are true; therefore, the answer should be None of the above.\n\nInput: While at the grocery store, did you forget to buy the vegetable you needed for dinner?

D:  A young woman falls to her death and the boy who hung from the side of the house dies minutes later. E:  A story is about a woman who finds joy when she learns that someone else died.\nRationales:1. To answer this, we need to understand the story and what a part of it is.\n2. The story tells of a dying painter and her neighbor, who is a free-loading artist.\n3. The painter's window faces the same street where the neighbor artist lives, and one day she sees a young boy hanging from her neighbor's wall.\n4. When the neighboring artist comes out and talks to the dying painter, he tells her that the boy's mother passed away and the boy has been hanging from that wall with the intent of following his mother's example and jumping to his death.\n5. The dying painter sees that the boy has no chance of following his mother'sa death as he is hanging upside down.\n6. She makes it her dying wish to die so the boy has an opportunity to die.\n7.

Choices:  \n\tA: to be B: to stay C: to go D: to return E: to remake \nRationales\n1. We will start with the meaning of the given prefix.\n\t2. We will exclude option by looking at its meaning. Explanation\na. To be: This prefix is not in the correct part of speech of the verb to do. If a verb ends with 'ing' it cannot take one of these three prefixes. 'Be' is in the infinitive part of speech, so it cannot take a prefix.\nb. To stay: This prefix is not the adverb or adjective needed here, as the correct options are 'to return' and 'to go'. Explanation\nc. To go: This doesn't mean the subject should go somewhere. Prefixes are not used in the right form of any verb that ends with '-ing'. Prefixes are not verbal forms. They are not used to form a verb.\nd. To return: This means it can be found in the prefix of a verb. Explanation\ne. To remake: To'make' is a verb. The only time a're' prefix can be used with a prefixed verb is with an infinitive verb. However, none of the given options are infinitive verbs that can be used with a're' prefix. So, B is the correct answer to this question.\n3. Looking for a combination that fits, choice D: to remake doesn\u2019t work.

Choices:  a) turn lights out and tell b) tell to be quiet or c) play music d) tell them they will not be able to play e) have them talk\nRationales:\nOption A: Turning out lights may be a reasonable option in some situations. However, it doesn't necessarily reduce noise and may even exacerbate the problem by darkening the classroom.\nOption B: This sounds like it could potentially work if the children understand and respond to commands. However, it may not work if they are not cooperative or have not been told to be quiet at other times.\nOption C: Playing music does seem like it could have a calming effect on some children and might help reduce their noise level. However, it may also depend on the type of music played and on the children's familiarity with it. Additionally, the music may not be effective for all children or in every situation.\nOption D: This doesn't seem like it would necessarily reduce the noise level of the children and could even be a distraction.\nOption E: This appears to work to some extent, but it may not be effective for children who are not inclined toward talking or for children who are speaking in the first place.\nConsidering all these aspects, the best answer is option B, which tells children to be quiet.\nAnswer:\nB) Tell them to be quiet.\n\nInput: What type of food is eaten on Shrove Tuesday?

We cannot use option L as the question does not specify that we can dig the house.\n  10.

We need, therefore, to find the name of a city with the tallest buildings.\n3. However we need to determine, whether the Burj Khalifas stands taller than all the other ones in the world at once.\n4. Therefore we need to determine, if the Burj Khalafa is the only tallest structure in the world (at the moment) and not a tallest building.\n5. We can cross out the first 4 choices, since they all can't be considered tallest buildings in the world.\n6. Option Singapore: the highest building is the Gardens by the bay with 296 meters.\n7. Option Hanoi: the tallest building is called Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower, it measures 261 metres, or 856 feet.\n8. Option Sydney:the tallest building is called Q1, it measures 323 metres, or 1,060 feet.\n9.

In such a case, they would likely start by communicating with family members and close acquaintances, considering their position and connections.\n   3. However, as the question states, the first person to be approached about the sale is the cash buyer, rather than the family members or cofounders. \n   4.

The question compares the choice of saving your money with spending it, asking which choice is better.\n2. We need the option that describes saving or saving it as the best option and answer, it can be C: saving it or A: saving your money. \n3. The first option C: saving it directly states that it is the better choice, as it takes more effort to save your money than to spend it.\n4.

Health care professionals typically don't have the time, resources or mandate to oversee all individuals' protection from economic and health threats.\n2. The federal government does play a role in ensuring that people can access health services but it\u2019s not specifically mentioned in the question, and the role of federal health programs is not mentioned either.\n3. Individuals and families who have health insurance do depend on healthcare professionals but the question doesn\u2019t specify their ability to ensure all people get protection.\n4. Insurance companies depend on health care professionals to treat patients but they do not have the time or resources needed to track the vulnerable persons who need protection.\n5. Public health care providers do try to ensure access to basic health services to all people but the question doesn\u2019 t indicate that they have the mandate to oversee the protection of the most vulnerable.\n6.

Choices:  B: William Faulkner  C: John Updike D: Raymond Carver E: Kurt Vonnegut\nRationales: One of the options may require additional analysis.\n1. C: John Updiik's birth year - (1932) is out of range, so he could not be the most famous modern writer if he was alive till 1980.\n2. The year of the death of Raymond Carver/Kurt Vonnegut is not known, so they can both be among the candidates of authors who are the most famous in history.\n3. A: William Faulkner - He died in 1962, but he was born 1897, and he was writing since 1926. Therefore, he is not the most famous modern writer.\n4. Since it is the 198Os, it can mean that they are dead till end of 1980, so the most famous modern writer is Kurt or Raymond because they were born after mid-1930s.\n5. Another condition was given - the 80's, so a decade or century is not needed.\n6. Therefore the answer is E: Kurt Vonneguot: Kurt Vonnegutt \u2013 22 November 1922 \u2013 11 April 2007 & He was most famous modern writer.(In the 80s) \nAnswer: E Kurt Vonnegut(Born Nov 22, 1922) he died Apr 11, 2007.\n\nInput: It's unusual to get a haircut every month with your best friend.

A: a university B: online C: a college D: secondary school E: a community college\nRationales: Considering the question as a whole, the most appropriate answer is Community college. Community colleges offer a wide variety of subjects and disciplines, giving students a chance to explore different areas of study in order to find their passion. They also provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their future career or the workplace. Moreover, community colleges emphasize career readiness, giving students the skills and knowledge they require to make informed decisions about their future. This ensures that students will be well equipped to take on the world and find success in whatever they do. Community colleges are committed to providing an environment that stimulates and supports students' mental growth.\nIt is because they provide students with the facilities and resources needed to succeed which include academic support services, such as tutoring and mentoring programs, job placement resources, and much more. It is because they offer a wide range of programs and services, such as technical and vocational programs, as well as academic support services for transfer students. It is because they provide education and training to prepare students for the workforce and support students with transferring to four-year universities and colleges.\nIt is because community colleges are focused on providing an education that will result in students finding success in the workplace and offering career counseling, internships, and other services to help students find meaningful careers.

{"text": ": strip mall\n\nInput: What is the term for a collection of stories or poems written by an author? Choices: 1. book 2. chapter 3. novelette 4. short story 5. novel\nRationales: This question tests reading comprehension by asking which term applies to a collection of writings by one author. To answer this question:\n1. We first need to understand the meaning of each of the given terms:\n   1) Book: A book is a collection of written material, usually bound together in a paper cover and containing a number of individual pages.\n   2) Chapter: A chapter is a short section of a book or a long piece of writing, often with an overarching theme or topic that is developed and explored over the length of the book. It typically contains sections of text known as paragraphs.\n   3) Novelette: A Novelette is a short form of a novel or a novel-length short story. The length of a novelette generally ranges from 17,500\u2013 40,000 words or between 40-120 pages long.\n   4) Short story: A Short story is a fictional narrative that tends to be shorter than a novel. There are a variety of short story lengths \u2013 from the very short-form of one page or less, micro fiction, to the longer forms of a short novella or novelette.\n   5) Novel: A Novel is a lengthy narrative, usually in literary fiction, consisting of a sequence, series, and of interrelated short stories. They involve a series of events with complex character & story arcs that are focused on one place over time.\n      Now that we understand the meaning of each term, we can identify which term applies to the collection of writings by an author.\n        \u27a1\ufe0f In this case, the writer has mentioned that our works are a collection of writings, poems or stories, which is synonymous with the term 'novel'. Hence, the correct answer is option '5') 'Novel'.\n   Answer: 5) 'Novel'\n\nInput: At what temperature does salt freeze?

Choices:  a: pine b: mint c: roasted espresso d: perfume e: spicy salsa\nRationales: a: The given text describes the question of smelling a 'pine' scent until it dissipates into a cloud and we want to find out what a 'pine' smell is associated with.\nb: The answer might be B: Mint, C: Roasted espresso, or D: Perfume. The given text can be interpreted in these ways. As mentioned above, we cannot smell something until it dissipates. This means that the scent should slowly dissipate because then one could smell it. When we eat roasted espresso or mint we can smell them because they dissipate more slowly. The answer can be both B and C because the scent must not be so strong or so distinct that it immediately leaves the nose.\nc: The answer might be A: Pine. The problem with the answer being A: Pine is that Pine is something that dissipates into clouds. Hence an answer that dissipates into a Cloud is considered wrong.\nd: The answer will not be E: Spicy Salsa as the Salsa which is very smelly, can be smelled.\ne:The question asks about a specific sense of smell and can be considered for the correct answer. The smell of Espresso is extremely smelly and if smoked, it dissipates into the cloud. Hence Perfume must be the answer. Now we cannot explain why E and D are wrong answers and A and C can be considered wrong.\nAnswer: D or E.\n\nInput: When is it a good idea to use a babysitter?

Since a closed beach is synonymous with a forbidden one, the options not providing reasons why it's not viable for people to swim for a year are A, B, and D.'\n3.

However, being \"the strongest\" also entails physical ability, courage, and morality, making'skills' unlikely.\ne: 'Having more money than someone else' can be interpreted as a form of self-proclaimed or comparative'strength', not necessarily a positive notion, therefore out of all available options it appears to be the least likely.\nb and c: When looking at these options together, we can", "answer": " 117"}

Choices: A. because it\u2019s harder to keep in shape B. out of necessity C. because she can D. she can\u2019t use it all E. that was how it was taught when she was a student\nRationales: This question is asking why a school teacher uses an old school chalkboard as it is a piece of outdated equipment. We will be answering this from the teacher's perspective because she must know the reasons better than the rest of us. Since we are getting an indication that 'an old chalkboard' is present in class, it is reasonable to infer that the teacher has been taught to teach with such a tool. The question also clarifies that she 'can't just leave it untouched.' The teacher, as a human being, would want to find out why she has been subjected to working with a piece of equipment that she does not quite understand to teach a group of young students. In this regard, the answers 'because it's harder to keep in [her] shape', 'out of necessity', and 'because she can't use it all' do not seem like logical reasons as they suggest that the teacher does not really know how to properly teach without the chalkboard being there. Therefore, the answer seems to be C 'because she can' that is to say, for the purposes of explaining the teaching method to the student.\nAnswer: C. because she can\n\nInput: The most commonly used instrument in the medical world is the __________ (syringe).

They're both spoken\nRationales: The question is concerned with the concept of tonal pitch and the differences between different kinds of sounds.\n1. The option A. There's No Difference is incorrect as it does not explain the difference between the two mentioned sounds.\n2. The option B. They Both Have The Same Pitch is incorrect as the statement implies that both the mentioned kinds of sounds have a same pitch.\n3. The option C.

It should be noted that the student is currently not doing the work, not that they did not do the work. So, they should be doing the work currently.\n1. \"Give an explanation\" is an option. \n2. However, this does not really describe an action to take in this situation, but more likely a reaction of another student, teacher, or parent when they realize that a student is not doing work, especially if the student is a trouble maker.\n3. \"Make an example\", does not require an answer because it is vague as to the answer. \n4. \"Go on to other students\" also does not describe an action of how to handle the situation if a student is not completing the work given, but rather the option to move on without addressing the student.\n5. \"Give the student assistance\" could be interpreted as answering the students work. \n6. However, based off the wording, it seems that the teacher, parent, or another adult is giving the assistance rather than another student, since student was not doing work.\n7. The option that describes the most clear action is \"Give Assistance before School\" since it suggests that the student is not doing work in school and another adult is going to help them before school.\n8. It does not clarify if it is the responsibility of the school staff to handle this or if it is the responsibility if the parent.  However, the student is not doing the school's work, so this would be done outside of the school and not school officials, but rather a parent or guardian. \n9. It is also likely that the student would need to be helped before the school's start time, in order to do their work before school.\n10.

Raising is the action of increasing the number and size of or taking care of animals to produce more.\n2. Sentencing can mean: giving someone a penalty or judgment. This is unrelated to animals.\n3. Sending is the action of transferring a person or thing into another person's or place's custody or control. This is related to the animals but the question asks for what they are raised.\n4. Moving is the action or process of transporting someone or something from one place to another. If animals are moved or transferred to a location for a short time period, they are likely to release the animal that is captured.\n5. Trained means: to teach (animals) to perform certain acts.

Give is the only choice that implies feeding a person.\n5. Starve is impossible to use if it's a person who is a giver, we can't be the one who's starving themselves and still give food.\n6. Give and Move doesn't really make sense.\n7. Give and Ask isn't a good option either, it doesn't really describe anyone that gives food.\n8. We are looking for someone who gives food to another person and the question states they are helping someone else, so feeding would be the most likely action.\nAnswer: 1) B) Feed", "answer": " 480"}

The question asks us for a place where movies are shown to the public.\n2. In order to determine the best answer, we need to analyze which option is most suited for that, and what movie-related actions are being performed in the other options - the four presented are: a: filmmaker, b: theatre, c: show movie, d: cinema hall.\n\n  3. The first one, filmmaker, is a person who creates a movie but doesn't show it to the public, hence not the answer.\n  4. Theatre, b, is a location where movies are shown so this is probably the best answer, and the only one that does what the question asks.\n  5. Show movie, c, is used to say a movie is played or displayed but does not refer to a place where movies play or display so the answer must be b - theatre.\n  6. Cinema hall, d, is a place where movies/films play or show which is similar to 'theatre' from the previous option therefore b must be the answer.\n  7. Cinema hall = d, theatre => c = c,show movie => b = b.\nAnswer: b: theatre\n\nInput: The word \"mild\" is a synonym for what?

Choices: A: no heat B: very cool C: a little cool D: moderate E: cold\nRationales: This question requires you to understand concepts regarding temperature and building structures.\n1. First, we will eliminate the options that are not specific to temperature.\n2. A: no heat and B: very cool both relate to the lack of heat, which is not about the temperature inside the building.\n3. Hence, the next option to eliminate is E: cold. Although it can be perceived as a type of 'cool' temperature, in this context, it is not relevant because it refers to weather conditions.\n4. Similarly, D: moderate isn't used to describe temperature. It is used to describe a range of temperature. As such, moderate can also be eliminated.\n5. Now, the options left are A: no heat, C: a little cool and D: cold.\n6. All three options describe cool temperatures, but D: cold is the most specific. The question asks about the minimum temperature, so having a reference temperature in place is required. Therefore, the option with the least room for doubt is D: cold.\nAnswer: D- cold\n\nInput: What was the first thing you can do with the new program?

Open Software- it's the first thing you can probably do with the new software. The question doesn't limit the choice to only this.\n2. Use mouse - the mouse can be used after you have opened the software.\n3. Download - it can be downloaded after the new software is opened.\n4. Set font - the software can be opened and settings like font size can be set.\n5.

A: The employee is not working hard enough.  E: No reason.\nRationales:  1) The question requires us to list all logical answers that explain why the person couldn't get the promotion if they aren't giving 100% effort.\n2) After listing all the answers, the correct answer should be one that's more probable and specific in nature.\n3) All of the mentioned answers may seem logical and plausible, but there's only one answer that the employees can get if they are not giving their 100% best efforts.\n4) The answer should be 'B: The employee is not committed enough' because 'The employee is not making a big difference' can't even be considered as a logical explanation why the person was not offered a promotion. Similarly, 'The employee is not working hard & smart', 'The employee doesn't give 100 % of efforts' is also not considered valid answers.\n5) The answer should be the one which is specific enough in nature and that is 'B: The employee isn't committed enough.'

It is then followed up by a series of options that would help the protagonist achieve this.\nOut of all the options, a paper can be considered a tool to get proof of things.\nA mountain or a point of elevation offers a great view of the surroundings and is a good place to shout.\nA diversion is created by something that distracts the audience or gets their attention away from the matter in question.\nAnd honesty being the best policy is a value system encouraging truth to be adhered to at all costs.\nIn summary, the best option would be, out of all possible choices, B: use a paper for evidence.\nAnswer: B; Use a paper\n\nInput: A student asked, \u201cWhat color do you wear for a job interview? Choices: A: black B: grey C: light blue D: white E: red\nRationales: In order to choose the correct option, one would have to first research job interview clothing based on company culture and their guidelines.\nA business professional is typically dressed with formal dark, conservative colours. These are usually the darker hues of navy, black, grey, or charcoal.\nHowever, these colours may differ based on company culture or the job interview environment. For example, in a more casual or outdoor environment, they would choose lighter shades such as light blue, or grey pants.\nIt is essential to consider the company culture when choosing which colours to wear.\nDressing in the wrong colours for a job interview can negatively impact the candidate's chances of being hired.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: white. Based on company culture and job interview environment, it is best to choose white or any other lighter shade of colour. Darker hues can be a turnoff as they may make the candidate seem too stern or strict while wearing such colours.\nIf one is not sure what company culture is or what colours a specific company may prefer, it is better to dress", "answer": " 400"}

Hence, from among all the options 'nothing' is the most probable answer - the boy is not in danger (option 2). Similarly, 'just a little' does not make much sense either: it can be misinterpreted as the little boy.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: nothing.\nAnswer: A.

The key to finding the correct answer is to consider the individual members of each group who are most likely to benefit from the class (in other words, their needs would be most likely met).\n\nIn Group A, it seems that two members (the patient and the nurse) would probably not benefit much from the class as their needs are more health-care related than related to \u201chow to teach.\u201d The student and the teacher would benefit, however.\nIn Group C, the patient and the teacher would benefit since their needs are more in line with what the class is trying to teach (how to teach/conduct a classroom). The nurse, student, patient would not benefit.", "answer": " 12"}

Choices:  C: bone A: food B: couch E: toy D: treat\nRationales: The question specifies that Renee wants her dog to be able to learn that bones are not edible food.\n1. A food bone, according to the description would be a food-like substitute typically made of plastic, rubber, or other similar materials. This would be an inedible bone and can't be considered appropriate dog training. Therefore, this choice is invalid.\n2. In addition to the rule above, bones cannot be referred to as substitutes for food as they are food for canines and cannot be trained as if they were not food. Hence, choice C of bone isn't feasible.\n3. Finally, we rule out the choice B of food because this can be a problematic option as food items usually cannot be taught as inedible.\n4. Choices E and D are inappropriate as well since a bone is a toy and a treat is a reward.\n5. The correct answer is choice", "answer": " 6"}

But, they want to make sure they are acting responsively while being considerate. They understand that being considerate is what will earn them the trust of others. By trusting them, they will feel better, and those others can trust them too. When others trust them, it makes them feel good too. So, they do their best to act considerate. \nThe option 'B' is all about \"Being kind or positive or helpful\", so it will not be rightly called as 'Being considerate'. Thus, it is not the correct answer.\ud83d\ude2e\n\n### Reveal Answer:\nAsk the person what they can do to act considerately, and they will say that they don\u2019t take shortcuts.

Firstly, we must think creatively about potential solutions to running out of milk.\n2. By thinking creatively, we come up with various options to tackle the problem.\n3. Option A: Eat it. Although it's possible, this option does not seem like the best solution as it requires more ingredients than just milk.\n4. Option B: Buy more. This option seems viable as it entails buying more of the necessary commodity.\n5. Option C: Mix it with other substances. This does not seem like a logical solution as it may alter the taste or texture of the milk.\n6. Option D: Drink it. Is feasible to consume the remaining milk, though it implies discarding the carton after use.\n7. Option E: Put it back. Is an unlikely option as many retail stores do not offer such a service or it's not practical to do so.\nTherefore, the only feasible option is B: buy it. By purchasing more milk, the consumer can tackle the problem of running out of milk. Hence, the answer choice is (B): Buy More, as it is the only solution that satisfies the given criteria and adequately addresses the issue of running out of milk by acquiring more of it.\n\nInput: Why is it that certain flowers have petals that are not equal in length?

A kitchen is the most suitable choice because research in chemistry and biology has a high probability of being done in a kitchen rather than in the grocery, grocery in the farm, the farm in the science, or the science in DFPP.\n2. One can conclude that research must be the scientific process or a practical study.\n3. Research done in the kitchen would require a science (chemistry / biology) background to do so, hence the probability of a scientific researcher being found in the kitchen is higher.\n4. The same can be said for grocery stores, for the grocery stores also require scientific training and a person with a science background has a high probability of setting up research in the grocery store.\n5. A bacteriologist is more of a researcher who conducts scientific research and finds bacteria. Researchers usually work in an area that is convenient and has access to the information they need.\n6. A bacteriological office may not be the same as a bacteriologist, considering that a bacteriology practice requires a large amount of access to resources and information to the point where a simple researcher would not have the expertise necessary to do so in this area.\n7. There are some exceptions to the general rules of a kitchen, for example, some researchers work in the kitchen and grocery stores and in the farms because these areas require scientific knowledge. As these areas would require the specialized knowledge and skill of a bacteriologist to be done in these areas.\n1. The farm \u2013 researchers may have to do research in these areas, but they might not have the necessary knowledge to conduct the research, hence the probability of research being in a farm is lower\n2. Science \u2013 research in science requires a lot of money, this is because the researcher has to spend a lot of time in the fields that need fieldwork. This research is expensive, for it is not as much information as in the kitchen, grocery, or farm areas, and may not allow access to all the necessary equipment. As research is expensive. The science area must have all necessary information and equipment as researchers", "answer": " 32"}

Choices:  A :get away B :get away with C :get away with D :not get  away  with E :do nothing\nRationales: There are several elements within this question that we must understand in order to be able to find an answer.\n1. The phrasing implies that the manager is advising another employee on a certain matter, specifically advising them to complain about their boss, or else the other employee might just allow the boss to get away with something.\n2. We need the context or details of the situation since the manager may have their own reasons or objectives for advising the other employee.\n3. So, using the given information, we know that the worker was being advised by their manager to complain about something that their manager had done. \n4. Next we need to determine the significance of the phrase 'get away with'. We understand now that 'getting away with' something implies that the other person didn't get punished for a certain action or act.\n5. If the phrase 'getting away with' is not crucial to the solution, which in this case it is, we can eliminate this phrase and the options that include it.\n6. From the remaining options, A: Don't let your bos get away with that and B: Not to let the boss get away with something, imply that the worker is not supposed to let their boss go unpunished or without consequence for something that they did such as lying, stealing, taking credit for something that they didn't do.\n7. From here, the choice of words 'not let the boss getaway with something' suggests that the boss should be punished for something that they did and that therefore the statement that 'do nothing' is impossible since the boss will definitely be punished and not 'get away with something'.\n8. Therefore the correct answer is option D: Don't let boss get away with it.\nAnswer:D:Don't let boss  get away with it.", "answer": " 108"}

Choices: A: $23 000 B: $430 000 C: $650 000 D: $125 000 E: $1430 per square meter\nRationales: It's likely that the question is asking about the difference in cost for buying a house in a city compared to a house in the countryside.\nThe options are:\n* $23 065\n* $430 842\n* $650 758\n* $125 252\n* $1430\n\nAs the question mentions a house and there is a difference in cost, it cannot be a question about a plot of land (C), so that's eliminated from consideration. Since there is a clear difference in city versus countryside, we can eliminate A and E immediately. It may be tempting to go immediately to $230 650 since it's the closest to $23000, but this could indicate a rounding error and not the answer. \nThe remaining two numbers are very close and can be rounded to within a reasonable amount, but still the differences are small. \nWe can eliminate the other more extreme options and come to $430 759 is an interesting value, as it's not only closer to $430000, it's also not very far from $650 656. \nHence, the correct answer is C: 316k\nAnd here is another one of those 'if you knew math well enough, you could figure out the answer' questions.\n\nInput: The house was more expensive than the apartment.

Since the question is about the tallest height, neither Option D nor E is correct.\nOption B cannot be correct either because Option A refers to the height of the eldest daughter, implying that the woman doesn't have a daughter of the same height.\n\nTherefore, Option C must be correct, referring to the height of the second daughter.\n\nAnswer: D: 27 feet\n\nInput: A baby echinoderm has five, seven, or eleven arms. How many limbs does an adult echinoderm have? Choices: A: eight B: six C: fifteen D: none\nRationales: The question is about the relationship between the number of arms/limbs/legs of certain types of echinoderms at different life stages.\nThe answers to this question are based on the differences in the number of limbs at specific life stages of a certain type of echinoderm (specifically, the sea urchin).\nWhen an echinoderm is alive the question gives us two options:\n* an adult echinodrum,\n* a baby echinodrum.\n\nThe question mentions both 'baby echinodrums' and five, seven, or 11 arms. 'Baby Echinodrums' is the correct answer because babies (or juveniles) have many fewer limbs than adults.\n\nThe options are given as eight limbs, six limbs, fifteen limbs, and none.   None is rejected as incorrect because it is an answer, and the correct answer is the only answer that has the correct number of limbs given in the question body.

To determine one of the possible solutions to the equation, we need to apply the principle of the excluded middle. The principle of the excluded\n        3. middle states that one has to choose between two statements, that is, if one is true, the other must be false.\n7. For the given equation 24x - (4)(4) = A, applying the principle of the excludes middle, either x is a multiple of 4, or it is not.\n8. If x is a multiple of four, the equation 24x -(4)(4) = (A \u00d7 4)= 0, implying answer 4.\n8. While if x is not a multiple of four, then the equation 24(x -4)= A is obtained. Thus, A has to be an odd number implying possibility 2 in the answer\n9.

The question describes the dog as being trained and going to the veterinary clinics for a successful visit.\n2.

The gator would be seen in the water, beach, or in a ditch.\n3. All the options can be described as water bodies.\n4. The choices that indicate the location of the gator last are coast, lake, water, ditch.\n5. The alligator would not be in the lake since that indicates that it was in the water and not in the ditch.\n6. Renee and Rode weren\u2019t playing in a lake.\n7.

The question \"How many siblings does Sam has\" asks us to find an answer to it.\n2. We can find the number of siblings Sam has by counting the number of sisters and brothers shared by Sam's father and maternal grandfather.\n3. We can observe that Sam's mother has 4 sisters, while his father has 4 brothers.\n4. Now we know that Sam has 4 sisters and 4 brothers, i.e. 8 siblings overall.\n5. Now that we know that Sam has eight siblings, we can further narrow down the possible numbers of his/her siblings by considering the options available.\n6. A: 2 - This option doesn't align with the description, as it implies that Sam only has one sibling, which is unlikely.\n7. B: 3 - We can confirm that Sam has three siblings after identifying that his mother and father have four siblings each, making a total of eight siblings overall. This matches the information of option B: 3.\n8. C: 4 - Similarly we can confirm that Sam has four siblings, as they correspond with his father and mother having four siblings each, for eight siblings overall.\n9. D: 5 - This option also aligns with the information that Sam has four brothers and four sisters, for eight siblings in total.\n10. E: 6 - We are told that Sam's mother and father have four brothers and four sister siblings each, totalling eight siblings in total, meaning that option 6 is also correct. The number of siblings does not necessarily correlate with number of sisters.\n11. Therefore, the answer 4 (correct answer) can be found from the options C: 4 and E: 6. They both include the correct amount. \n\n\nInput:   I have got the feeling that Jaden is an incredibly _________ person. Choices: a: mean b: angry c: good d: kind e: lazy f: stupid", "answer": " 3"}

Looking at the options, it's clear that the situation can take two forms \u2013 Yes or No.\n3. Yes does not fit the question at all, as it does not answer the asked \"Is first man in line the... at a ticket dispensal station\u201d.\n4. Likewise, No is also of no consequence as its answer does not directly align with the question.\n5.

Choices:  B: Yes C: No D: Maybe\nRationales: The question asks wether a person need to do taxes while working the first week of employment.\n2.

Although these options may be correct, let's compare them to the other choices.\n4. Option A can't be correct as the answer \"May be\" doesn't make a solid claim about whether one must do taxes within the employment scope.\n5. Similarly, option B is the wrong choice. It states that the answer is a solid yes, and thus, isn't a logical answer to the question.\n6. Hence, the correct answer is D, \"May be\".

This question and response is a statement-response task.\n2. The response must be an appropriate complete sentence that appropriately follows from the given statement/question.\n3. The statement given here is: 'Why did it take a long to solve the problem?'\n4. The statement states that the problem was solved but it took a long time before the problem could be solved.

The options that follow are what are possible explanations for when a car's seat is folded down (meaning that seats in the back of the car are no longer in place).\n3. Option A: (It is used) does not match the question. The question is asking what happens in the case of a car seat having been folded, so the option refers to a situation in which the seat has been used.\n4. Option B: (It is still in the car) does not match the option in that situation, the seat may or may not be in the car. Considering this, it cannot be the answer.\n5. Option C: (It is not in your car) does not match as it refers to the seat not being in the car rather than in the state of the car.\n6. Option D: (A rear seat is the backseat) refers to part of the car as already stated. It refers to the fact that the car has two seats.\n7. Option E: (Do not use your back seat) refers to the fact that one should not use their back seat as having used the back seat would mean that the seat had been placed down.

In the phrase 'thirteen', the last digit is '1', which doesn't follow nine when counting forwards from nine.\n5. Similarly, 'fourteen' starts with the letter '1', which follows nine when counting forwards, while 'fifteen' begins with the letter '5', which doesn't.\n6. Therefore, only the answer options that follow the rule of increasing by ten when counting forwards from 'nine' are valid as alternatives and they are B: Three, E: Thirteen and H: Fourteen.\n7. The answer to the prompt is option E: Thirteen, as this follows the rule when counting forwards from \"nine\".\nAnswer: E: Thirteen\n\nInput:   What does one unit of measurement have six of?

We look at the options and see that they vary in length with the largest number being 75, and the smallest being 12, and the answer is either D or E.\n  3. The first option is 7-12. Let's focus on the first number. The number seven can be divided into two by multiplying it by 3.5, so 7x3.5=25.5. Subtract two from 25.5, and you get 23.5. Multiply 23.5 by 3.5. 23.5x3.5=80.75. So, the numbers are related. Next, let's consider the second option, which is 41-57. We start with 41. Divide it by two and you get 20.5. 20.5x3.0=61.75. Add five to 61.75, and you get the number 66.5. 66.5x3.7=237.625. Subtract 67.6625 from 237.6626 and you get the answer of 199.9994, confirming that the two answers are indeed related.\nAnswer:\n\n\n## Instructions\n### Instruction 1: Answer the following arithmetic question.\n\n## #answer : This should be a statement that appropriately completes 1 6000 x 25\n```\n\n\n### Instructions: Choose one of the given responses as the best answer.\n\n\n### Demostration: Input: A dog sitter will often walk the dog during the day.

Choices:  a. the office that issued the ban  b. malls c. restaurants d. markets e. none of the above\nRationales:\n1. The question describes that some countries prohibit wearing of shoes in public areas, and asks from the given options 'Where is a shoe store then?'\n2. The answer can be provided based on the context of the question, i.e. \"What would a shoestore be doing in a country that prohibits wearing shoes?\"\n3. Considering each of the provided options and eliminating those that do not fit the provided context:\n   a) Office - It is unlikely for a shoe store to be located inside an office.\n   b) Mall - This might be a possibility as malls are known to house a variety of retail stores, and a shoe store may be one of them.\n   c) Restaurant - Although restaurants may sell shoes, they are unlikely to have a shoe store within them.\n   d) Market - Although markets often sell a variety of items, a shoe store is not something you might find in a market. Therefore the answer has to be 'none of the above'.\n4. According to the context, it seems that having a shoestore in a location where shoes are prohibited is contradictive. That is the reason none of the provided options are correct.\n5.

To provide mechanical advantage to the cylinder walls 4. To balance the weight of the cylinders 5. To reduce reciprocating weight\nRationales: Input 1: To provide a rotating outlet The purpose of the crankshaft is to provide a rotating output, meaning that it has a key function in transferring the vehicle's power to a drive shaft or other components.\nInput 2: To support the engine block The engine block is a rectangular piece of metal that holds all the essential parts inside the engine. Its primary role is to provide structural support to the engine and to keep it in one piece without moving around.\nInput 3: To provide mechanical advantage to cylinder walls The crankshaft provides mechanical advantage to the piston and cylinder walls by changing the direction of force. This allows the piston to move smoothly in the cylinder, making it easier to start the engine and control its speed.\nInput 4: To balance the weight of cylinders The weight of the cylindirs is distributed evenly on the crankshaft, ensuring that they all rotate at the same speed. This helps to reduce vibrations and improve performance.\nInput 5: To reduce reciprocating weigth The crankshaft reduces the reciprocating weight or mass of the entire engine by transferring the mechanical force from the pistons, which would otherwise be transferred to the crankshaft itself.\nAnswer: A crankshaft is used to provide a rotating output, support the engine block, provide mechanical advantage to the plieter walls, balance the weight of the engines cylinders, and reduce reciprocating weight.\nAnswer: 1\n\nInput: How did the first settlers to Australia get home?

Choices: \nA: pick a high-end item \nB: Choose an inexpensive gift\nC: pick anything too personal\nD: pick a gift from a local business\nE: pick a gift they couldn't use \nRationales: It's important to answer questions like this by weighing the options carefully and considering what qualities each item possesses. It's important not to focus solely on just one factor when making a decision. By considering every option thoroughly you can make better choices. \n\nThe first option given, ''A: pick a high - end item,'' suggests an expensive gift would be inappropriate because it may indicate disregard for their post-graduation financial situation. That leaves B, C, and D as valid options. \n\n\nThe second option presented is ''B: Choose an ''inexpensive gift'','' the idea of choosing an inexpensive gift implies caring but the individual may also feel pressure to show their appreciation in a more costly way. The final option proposed is ''E: pick a gift from your local business'' which could seem thoughtful in some circles but it could also be seen as an attempt to avoid paying full price elsewhere. \n\nThe last and final option presented is ''C: pick anything too ''personal,'' which may suggest an idea so grand or unique that it could be uncomfortable for the recipient to recieve or too much to expect them to accept as a graduation present.

{"text": ", strip mall\n\n## Resources\nInput: There many benefits of attending online community colleges and in-person community colleges. However, there are also certain situations in which attending the same school online may give a student a better option for learning at a cheaper rate. As a rule of thumb, the best choice is dependent on whether a school allows the student to take a hybrid of classes. Many online community colleges allow students to take courses online and in person. This means that there are various ways to earn a degree. However, this does not always apply. At some community colleges, the only way to get an associate's of arts degree is to take online courses. What is most crucial are the courses taught by the same professor. As with most classes, this is likely to make it easier to learn.  \nRationales:  1. What is being highlighted here is a scenario where certain community colleges may not offer hybrid classes, i.e., a blended course that combines online and in-person instruction.\n2. It is important for students to weigh all the options and make an informed decision.\n3. The given statement concludes that a better option for learning may be available to online community college students if a school allows them to take both types of courses. It also highlights that the most crucial factor is having the same professor for the majority of classes, as this will likely make it easier to learn and grasp the material.\n4. Comparing the available options, D: Both of these options, online and in-person classes, are offered by community colleges.\n5. Online classes offer flexibility to students who struggle with in-person interaction. They can attend classes without sacrificing their current responsibilities, such as work or family.\n6. In-person classes, however, offer a more face-to-face learning experience, which can be helpful for students struggling with time management or who prefer to learn in person.\n7. Both options have their pros and cons, but ultimately the best choice will depend on the individual student's needs and preferences.\n8. With the consideration of this, the conclusion is that, 'In general, both online and in-person community college classes offer their own benefits and drawbacks. Students should consider their goals and preferences when deciding which type of class to take.'\nAnswer: C: In-person classes", "answer": " 36"}

The question states that if a car has an engine with five cylinder\u2019s horsepower can be calculated by multiplying the engine\u2019s RPM by 5 and dividing by 2. For example, if a car has an RPM of 7,000 divided by 2 can give us 1,527.7 hp at the most. Therefore we will multiply that amount to find the highest and the lowest horsepower.\n2. The given options are already in decimal form. The number of cylinders do not appear in the options, the question is whether it is horsepower and not HP for example. \n3. As horsepower is the unit of power and there are 5 cylinders, the question implies that the answer is 830.\nAnswer: B. 830\n\nInput: Which of the following could be a reason that most people will be working for home in the future?

A: Talk\nB: Read\nC: Share a meal\nD: Touch hands in public\nE: Be friends\nRationales:  1. The given passage details the story of two lonely people connecting and spending time together.\n2. The woman who wrote it said there's a way to make men and women closer, not further apart.\n3. 'Read' means to examine text carefully or fully, so this does not address the issue at hand.\n4. 'Share a meal' suggests that they each got something from their own homes, not that they shared the same food.\n5. 'Be friends' does not directly relate to the goal of men and women spending time together. This doesn't necessarily facilitate connection.\n6. 'Touch hands in public' does not appear to directly address the idea of making men and women closer and does not support this goal either. It may instead make men and women more distant.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is 'Talk', as the passage describes a situation where two lonely people have connected and spent time together, presumably through verbal communication, which is implied to be the intended way of making men and women more closely intertwined. Hence, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A Talk\n\nInput: Where can a person who is looking for jobs find them?  What does the writer say about finding jobs at libraries?

The statement \"there are lots of jobs, but not all are in libraries\" indicates that libraries are a good place to look for jobs.\n3. Looking for jobs at stores, the employment office, the internet, and home are not good places to look for jobs. This is clearly suggested by the statement.\n4. 'Libraries' is the best answer since it is the place where a person can find jobs looking for them.\nAnswer: A Libraries\n\nInput: Is there a good explanation for why the number of people in prison has gone up over the years?

Since this is the literal meaning of the term K.K, it would be correct to select it if the girl understood the term as such.\n4) 'Beautiful', as an answer, would not be correct because the autistic girl is unlikely to understand the implying connection of 'beautiful girl' and 'pretty'.\n5)'Fun' is a term used to describe an event or activity, and can thus indicate a recreational experience or a way of spending free time, but it does not necessarily depict an emotion or mental state.\n6) If the autistic girl associates the term", "answer": " 14"}

Choices: 1-Fall 2-Curl up 3-Lean forward 4-Move back and forth 5-Cross your arms 6-Hope it\u2019s not a sign of the plane breaking up\nRationales: The situation described by the given question sounds like motion sickness, as a passenger on an airplane experiences shaking, bouncing, jerking, and other disturbances. Motion sickness is a common condition in which a person feels sick when moving due to conflicting perceptions of visual and other sensory stimuli regarding motion.\nWhen airplane passengers feel motion, they should follow the advice below:\n   Fall: Do not move or walk around if the seat is not properly secure. Seatbelts should be fastened, and travelers should wait until the plane is at an appropriate speed before walking around. The body weight should be supported so the head does not bounce up and down. Use the arm rests and hold on tight to avoid getting thrown into the side wall. \n   Curl up: If the person feels nausea or other motion-related discomforts, he/she should lie down on the floor by placing the feet and back along a straight line.\n   Lean forward: The passenger can lie down but try to keep his/her head and back level with the seat. If he/she can\u2019t, he/she can lean forward.\n   Move back and forth: He should try walking back and forth in the aisle to move some motion and keep feeling better.\n\nAccording to the given scenario, the correct answer is 4-Move Back and Forth \n    The following response is the answer to the question:\n\nMove back and forth: He can try to walk back and forth in the plane\u2019s aisle to move the motion and keep him feeling better.\n\nAnswer: Move back and forth.\n\nInput: How can you tell if a fish is fresh?

Choices A: eat chocolate B: put ice on their head E: lie down C: drink a lot of soda D: eat aspirin\nRationales:1. The sentence \u2018the last thing most adults...\u2019 informs us that the action is performed in the end or when the headaches have arrived.\n2. The choice options: A: eat chocolates, B: put ice on head, C: drink a lot soda, and D: eat aspirins are possible to solve but are not the last thing most adult does when they feel a head ache coming on.\n3. The first step towards solving a task is analyzing what is not there. For example, eating chocolate is not something that adults do at the last stage of a headache coming on.\n4. In the passage, the author does not mention any reference to the last stage of a sudden headache coming on. Also, adults do not eat aspirins as a remedy as their age prevents them.\n5. The last thing adults do when they are experiencing a headache is lie down as the passage uses the word 'lying' to describe the act and its last stage.\nAnswer: D Lying\n\nInput: Your friend thinks your birthday gift is a wonderful gift.

Choices:  I: make more sounds I: louder sounds II: faster sounds III: shorter sounds IV: longer sounds V: faster moving sounds VI: softer sounds VII: higher-pitched sounds VIII: slower moving sounds IX: fewer sounds\nRationales:\n  The answer is D.

If none of the previous options are true, proceed to the last option E. 4. If none of the above have been established as false or established as true, consider the possibility of option E.\n1. Answer (A): The first time-related indicator in this question is \u201cafter lunch\u201d and the \u201cI\u201d refers to an individual. Therefore, option A is false because the question asks when the subject (i.e., a visitor to NY) ate pizza in NY.\n2. Answer (B): 3 days ago - Answers that are more than 24 hours ago would likely be false, so option B is rejected.\n3. Answer (C): Today 1:00 \u2013 This is close to what the question asks, but we\u2019ll keep looking further back.\n4.

It takes longer than that to do grooming, selecting and dressing clothes, making up etc.\n2. Therefore, options other than 0: 0 and 1: 1 are correct based on the context.\n3. Considering these facts, the answer must be between 2: 2 to 4: 4.\n\nAnswer: 2: 2\n\nInput: Which of the following is an open-air markets?

Choices A: His essay is too short because he didn't answer the questions. B: His essay is poorly written. C: His essay lacks structure D: The essay doesn't flow and there are too many ideas. E: He didn't list the important parts of the essay.\nRationales: Considering only the given information, we can easily conclude from the options B(poorly written) and D (doesn't flow and has too many ideas), that either or both of these statements cannot be entirely false. \n1- It is correct that if the essay is poorly structured it doesn't have flow.  The writer needs to improve the flow. The essay has too many ideas which is an indicator of weak essay.\n2- The writer had given his college essay and the college had rejected it and said it was incomplete.  As the essay was too short, it didn't answer all the questions. In addition, the essay lacked structure.  Hence, the essay is incomplete or lacks something.\n3- Since the essay doesn't have flow the writer might have written each and every idea separately or the writer was unable to conclude the flow. Hence, this could be a problem.\n\n\nAnswer: \nThe student was told that his essay is poorly writing.\n\nInput: A boss wants his employees to have to use the company's new computer system. Which one of these may make the change happen? Choices A: A staff meeting B: New computers C: A new hiring process D: Better understanding of the system\nRationales: Based only on the information given, the answer would have to be any option other than D: Better understanding of system. A staff meeting and new computers seem like reasonable approaches that would encourage employees to use the system. On the other hand, it would be unlikely that understanding of the system would encourage employees to start using it - employees already understand the system or should understand it to use it.

A: gross amount paid B: tax amount paid C: net amount received D: average net amount received E: amount of time spent working\nRationales: The given passage outlines several different ways to calculate one's monthly income. With the information provided, choosing the most accurate will be necessary.\n\n1. The first option mentioned is gross amount paid which refers to the total amount of income received before taxes are calculated.\n2. The next option is tax amount paid, which refers to the amount of money taken from one's paycheck to cover tax obligations. It will not be the most accurate because taxes can come out to be different for every individual based on the tax codes and exemptions that one qualifies for.\n\n3. Option C, the net amount received, refers to the amount of income taken out after the required taxes have been deducted. This is the most accurate as tax obligations will vary depending on the individual's tax code, and it will be the most accurate to deduct the actual tax obligation.\n\n4. Option D, the average net amount received, is inaccurate, as it only includes the average of the net income received after taxes.\n\n5. Option E, the amount of time spent working, refers to the total amount spent on working for an entire pay period, which is not the same as the amount of income received.\n\nConclusion: Option C, the net income received, is the most accurate.\nAnswer: C E: the most accurate\n\nInput: Why do you have to look through your window?

It is possible that the window is dirty, which would require one to either clean it or look through another window that is not dirtied.\n2.

The winners received a treat.  The game was easy enough for them to share. How many students shared a treat?\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question states that 1 student shared a treat which makes sense since 1 is a whole number.\n\n### Option 1:\nIf only one student shared a treat in the first grade class, then there is no need for the students to share treat at all since there is only one student present. Furthermore, there would be nothing for them to share and discuss since each student only has 1 treat in this scenario. \n\nAlso, if you want 1 student to share a treat with each whole number, then they would have to count the rest of the class by 1 to a whole number. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. So if we wanted 15 students to share a treat, then they would need to share with 5 students (5 x 3 = 15) since there is only 1 treat. So in this example, 15 students shared a treat.\n\n### Options 2:\nFirst, the second option states 1st grade class can not be a whole number since a grade is just a subject and not a whole or fractional number. 2nd and 3rd grade classes can be whole numbers but not first grade classes since they can not be whole numbers. \n\nIf the 1st grade class is made up of 2 students, then there would have been 0 students that shared a treat since there was only two students in the class and no need to share with each other so there would be nothing for any of the 2 students to share", "answer": " 135"}

Pencil - A pencil is an object that is traditionally used for writing or drawing with a tip consisting of graphite or other media. Although this could be considered an alternative, it does not suit the nature of this query regarding an alternative for a pen and may not be a good choice for this type of task.\n  2. Highlighters - Highlighters usually do not work as an alternative to a pen because a highlighter must be used in conjunction with a writing implement, like a pen or pencil, to \"highlight\" the text to be highlighted.\n  3. Ink pen - An ink pen is a standard pen that contains ink as its content. Ink pennies are often used for writing or drawing and are generally very widely available. Although ink pens can be used as a writing tool or for drawing, they are not compatible with highlighting and may not be suitable for this type of question.\n  4. Ballpoint pen - A ballpoint pen is a technical writing instrument that contains ink as a medium and a ball as a key to allow the pen to roll easily. This form of writing instrument is not compatible with highlighting a text and therefore may not be the most suitable alternative in this scenario.\n  5.

What trait is this? Choices:  a: color b: taste c: size d: smell e: flavor\nRationales:\n1. The given passage describes a pear as a fruit, showing that a pear seed can grow into a pear tree.\n2. Trait refers to something that possesses or indicates a distinct characteristic, quality, or property, e.g., color, size, and smell, etc.\n3. Since the given question requires us to find the answer that indicates distinct characteristics, we will have to rule out options 'color' and 'taste'. It is highly unlikely that the reason for a pear being considered a fruit is color or taste, and the given question does not specify any information about the distinctiveness of the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of a pear, thus it cannot be taken into account as a trait to understand why a pear is a fruit.\n4. The same can be said for answers'size' and'smell', since size and smell cannot clearly be considered a 'trait'.\n5. This leaves us with 'flavor' as the only relevant answer. The phrase \"demonstrates how a fruit seed...\" clearly says that the distinct characteristic to understand whether a pear is considered a \"fruit\" or not is the distinct characteristic of how a fruit seed grows into a fruit.\n6. This means that the distinct characteristic to be considered is only 'how an object grows into another object'. 'Smell' and 'taste' cannot be taken into account here due to the fact that they cannot be considered \"how an object grows into\" another object. In short, if the phrase \"this is flavor\" were to be mentioned here, we would then be able to understand 'b: taste' as the only valid choice in the given question.\n7. Flavor as a trait is different from the other traits mentioned in this question, therefore, the correct answer is e: flavor.\nAnswer: E - Flavor.", "answer": " 11000"}

Carrots are easier than broccoli. 11. Broccoli is better than carrots.\nRationales: The options can be narrowed down as follows: Option 1: There is evidence of a cause and effect relationship. This is the most logical choice because it seems the author describes that more light is better than other sources of light. As a result, this is how people can learn better. Similarly, carrots provide better vitamins than broccoli.

The present will never happen again C. The future doesn't exist D. The present is not important E. The world is going downhill\nRationales: We begin by identifying the key phrase within our instructions, from which we can formulate a working interpretation based on our knowledge of the vocabulary.  We have been provided with the title of a poem, \"The Time Machine\".  The title suggests that this may relate to the passage of time, either from past to future or vice versa.  To be able to answer this question with certainty, we use our knowledge that \"the present\" generally refers to the moment just before something is said or understood.\n\n1. Based on our analysis, we know that the key part of the instructions relates to \"the present\", so our first strategy is to look for the best option that will relate to \"the present\" as a whole.  If we look at our options, we see that \"the future doesn't exist\" refers to something that isn't, whilst \"the present is not important\" refers to a lack of something.  \"The present will never happen again\" is something that has happened in the past, so that does not seem suitable.  This leaves us with \"The present is the best thing about the present...\".\n\n2. However, there are other clues within the question that direct our attention to the phrase \"the best thing about being present\", which suggests we may need to understand this phrase to use it to answer our question.  To do this, we go back to our understanding of the phrase \"the present\", which refers to the moment just prior to understanding something.  If we take this meaning, \"presence\" is the idea of being there physically.  For example, if we were walking in a room and a friend was calling our name, we would not respond if we were not present in the room to hear our name.  This leads us to the conclusion that \"the best thing about you\" is the closest option to the phrase \"the present is the best...\", and hence we select A.\n\nAnswer: A: nothing matters\n\nInput: What are good qualities associated with being a successful salesperson?

The question asks for a word that begins with 'R' that refers to a kind of bed upon which a person might rest for comfortable sleep before enjoying a preferred TV show.\n3. Floor, couch, bench, and chair can't be appropriate.\n4. If bed (choice C) is the answer, we've got ours, but we don't know if bed fits well with the specific requirements of the question.\n5. Let's look at the meaning of bed from Oxford Learner's Dictionary: 'A long, narrow piece of furniture with a flat base that provides a place for people to rest'\n6. Now that we have some idea about the meaning of bed, when we look at the given information again, we see that Diane uses couch (choice A) or floor (choice B) and not bed, to rest on.\n7.

According to the information given about a hired detective, the employer is the one who will hire or fire him.\n3. The detective will not be hired by the fireman but in the capacity of a fireman.\n4. An investigator is a person of curiosity, and a person must be curious in order to be a detective.\n5.

Then we'll cross off anything that is uncommon.\n1. All three items begin with the letter 'P', which makes picking something less likely.\n2. French fries use potato as ingredient, while potato doesn't require french fries for completion.\n3. French fries are consumed in a smaller number, potato in higher amounts. Since french fries' consumption is lower than potato, it makes the difference between potato and french fries bigger.\n4.

To understand the question, we should first define the term \"cough\" according to the dictionary.\n2. The definition will give us information about what does it mean to have cough in general.\n3. After doing that, we analyze the options:\n   A - It is about not having a cough, not specifically about not sniffing.\n   B - The definition is about not coughing at all, not literally about someone not blowing their nose.\n   C - Coughing is a medical condition that causes mucus to be expelled from the airway, hence, it is connected to the blowing of one's nose only\n   D -  Breathing is the action of inhaling and exhaling air through the nose or mouth, so it is not about not sniffing only.\n   E - Sniffing is the action of taking in air through the nose in an intentional attempt to smell something.\n4. As it can be seen, we are left with options A & D, so the final answer is D.\nAnswer: D Blowing one's nose\n\nInput: What is a common way to end a dinner?

Choices: A: xylophone B: trombone C: violin D: glockenspiel E: drum set\nRationales: The wording of the prompt is crucial to its interpretation, since it mentions kids and their instrument, which are both subjective concepts which require further analysis.\nOne way to approach the problem is to ask, \"When a young person is learning to play a musical instrument, what would they get started on?\".\nWhen a young person learns to play a new instrument, they need to know about the instrument and understand how to read the music. They also need to practice and develop the skills that are specific to their chosen instrument. This process does not happen overnight.\nSince this is a childhood experience, it is not surprising that the instrument that gives kids the best chance to start playing is the 'Instrument that a beginner can play after only a short time of practice'.\nAnother way to approach this task is by looking at how a person learns the instrument and the skills they need to play.\nA glockenspiel is the easiest instrument to play because you don't need any formal music lessons to learn the basics.\nA glock is a metal xylophone with small bells. It is designed to be easy to play and allows anyone new to musical instruments to start learning the basics of music.\nThe glockenspiel can be a simple toy or a full-size instrument that has 25 to 35 notes.\nChildren that receive lessons to learn how to play can learn on a glockenspiel, but they will still need to practice with real instruments like the violin or trombone after they have mastered the basics.\nThe last way to answer this prompt is by using common sense.\nTo be truly effective, a kid\u2019s instrument must be small enough for their hands to hold easily, but large enough to make an appealing sound. It must also have a variety of sounds to make it entertaining.\nThis makes the answer to this question clear: The instrument that kids' play the most is the 'Kid's Instrument that is easy for Kids to learn and that kids can have fun playing'.\nThe answer, therefore, is E, the Drum Set.\nAnswer: E Drum Set", "answer": " 175"}

We can see that all the animals except bats have wings, so that is an important piece of information to remember.\n3. In addition, each of the animals has ears on their heads.\n4. Now that we have that information, we can look at each option and determine the potential answers:\n5. A: Badgers - The badger does not have wings and does have ears on its head\n6. B: Bears - The bear does not have wings and has ears on its head\n7. C: Bison - Bison sometimes have wings and do not have ears on their heads\n8.

Thus, we should aim to understand what the difference between the breath rates of people is.\nAccording to the choices mentioned in the question, breathing rate varies from 5:1 to 12:1, so the answer is going to be either c or d (5 or 8); since the passage doesn\u2019t mention the time it takes us to breathe (let\u2019s say 5 seconds in any situation) \n5:1 breathing ratio means that it takes us 4 cycles to breathe and 1 cycle to recover (5:1).\n8:1 breathing ratio implies that for 1 cycle, we need to breathe 7 times, after which we need 1 cycle to recover.\nAs said, the passage doesn\u2019t specify the time taken to breathe and the difference in ratios is from 5:1 and 8:1, this information makes b unsuited to the question, i.e. the time taken to breed and ratio differences are insignificant. This makes b unsuitable for answering the question. c being 5:1 ratio and the remaining choices being 8:1 or greater would most definitely provide us with a better understanding of the answer to the question. \nIt wouldn\u2019t take much time to understand the difference between c (5:1 ratio) and d (8:1 ratio). Given that there is no mention of the duration of breath, the difference between c and d is 3:1, which means 3 cycles in C and 4 cycles in D.\nAnswer: e. 12:1 ratio\n\nInput: During World War I, what was the most difficult weapon that soldiers had to use?

Choices:  H: roast  I: barbecue  J: charcoal  K: soup  L: baked\nRationales: This question is about different types of food that are cooked slowly over fire. Considering this, each option can be evaluated by examining which food would be traditionally cooked this way.\n1. Roast: The roasting of meat is a traditional method of cooking, where meat is seared and then baked in an oven for a long period of time. This process occurs slowly over fire but takes place in an oven rather than directly over fire.\n2. Barbecue: Barbecue is a type of cooking method where food is slowly cooked over indirect heat from coal, wood, gas, or electricity. It typically takes place over an open fire, fireplace, or grill.\n3. Charcoal: Charcoal refers to burnt wood and is an inert form of carbon, which does not create any heat on its own. As such, it would need to be heated by another source before it could be used for cooking.\n4. Roast: While soup can be cooked over fire, it does not require long simmering and will typically get cooked in a shorter amount of time than roast.\n5. Baking: Baked goods like cakes and breads are usually baked in ovens at a relatively high temperature for a short period of time. As such, they can't be cooked slowly over fire in the traditional sense.\n6. By considering these criteria, H: Roast is the most appropriate option.\nAnswer: H: Roast", "answer": " 16"}

The question asks us to choose from given options, what requires a license.\n2. It's possible to infer that a job requiring a license could be a job one needs a license to do.\n3. Considering each of the given options -\n   A: Driving - Driving requires a license, so this one is a good choice.\n   B: Fishing - Usually requires a fishing license, hence it's a correct option. Fishing is one of the many things that one might need a license to do. That said, this one is also a correct choice.\n   C: Working - While it has to do with licenses, and certain professions may require a license to perform work, it's not a good match, as 'Work' in the context doesn't have this meaning.\n   D: Owning - Owning, in the context, doesn't mean that you need a license to 'own' anything, while this option is used for certain things( like owning a car or a house) one doesn't need a license to own.\n   E: Caring - While there are licenses for careers that involve caring for people, in the given context, it doesn't fit the wording or meaning, and so, is the worst choice.\n4. Based upon the fact that options B, D, and E don't provide us 'a job requiring a license', we can reasonably conclude that the only remaining options are A, and C - thus, the correct answer is A 'driving', and C 'fishing'.\nAnswer: A: driving, and C: fishing\n\nInput: How did the two teams feel because of the results of the basketball game? Choices:  D: relieved F: surprised L: satisfied N: displeasure O: anger\nRationales:1.

Choices: A: ask for time off B: ask them to finish work tasks C: write a warning letter D: give them a phone on their desk E: make them work longer hours\nRationales:\n\n1. The context suggests that the question is about a person who uses their company's work computer for outside purposes after work hours, and they might be doing this in a way that is not in line with company policies or expectations.\n\n2. The provided options give us some ideas of what the best solution might be, but in the end, based on context \n\nwe can conclude that the correct option is C: write a warning to them.\n\nGiven that we are dealing with a person abusing a company's resources outside of work hours, writing a warning letter serves this twofold purpose of reminding them of company\nexpectations as well as drawing their attention to potential disciplinary actions. A phone on their desk is given less consideration because it is not as effective at conveying these things.\nGiving them time off means relying on luck, so it is a less practical answer choice, and it may not be possible if there are others waiting to use the work computer for business purposes. Asking them to finish work tasks is a bit too vague and not guaranteed to solve the issue. Asking them to work longer hours means increasing their stress levels and the risk of fatigue, which can worsen the situation.\n\nAnswer: C: write a warning\n\nInput: What are three activities that most kids prefer to do during winter? Choices: A) play soccer B) play volleyball C) play ice hockey D) play water polo E) play basketball\nRationales: Considering the context of the question, we can conclude that kids' favorite activities in winter would be playing ice hockey, playing water polo, and playing basketball. These activities are typically popular during that season, and the game of volleyball is specifically mentioned as an in-season sport, meaning that it's not as commonly played during winter. Similarly, soccer is mentioned as an outdoor sport, suggesting that it might not be as popular during winter, when there's more demand for other indoor activities. In contrast, ice hockey, water pol", "answer": " 31"}

In it, _the passage was_, is missing. You will need to choose one of the words that could fill in that blank and be a suitable part of the sentence.\n\n### Example Answers\nI. Option B - The blank in the phrase \"In it _____ was\" is singular and, therefore, only one word can be used as the answer.\n\n\"In it _____ was, was a chapter on how to ______.\"\n\nBecause the sentence doesn't make any sense if \"In it _______ ____ was\" is filled with plural words, it's clear that \"was\" must be singular, and \"a\" is not an option. \"In it ________ _______ was, was\" makes the most sense if \"a\" is replaced with \"the\" so _the blank in the phrase \"_______ _______ ______\" is to be filled with \"the.\"\n\nII. Option D - This phrase \"the ___ was found in the old book\" is missing \"in\" and so should be filled in with \"to.\"\n\n\"The ___ was found in to the old book.\"\n\nIII.

The question asks what part of the human body does a specific part called the brain live in, specifying that it is not actually in the brain itself.\n2. Brains are often represented as being inside something - so for example a brain in a box.  But according to the passage brain does not actually live IN the box so the question needs to answer what part of the human brain or body it does live.\n3. In this case, because the brain does not live IN the brain, the brain must live somewhere else.  That somewhere is either in another part of the body, or outside the body at all.\n4. In order to answer the question, we must look through the provided options of what parts of the body it could live in.\n5.  Eye- the brain does not live in the eye, it is instead located in another part of the brain. However the brain is actually located in a specific part of the brain so can be eliminated from the options.\n6. Kidney- the brain does not normally live in the kidney, and the kidney is part of the body in which the brain is so can be eliminated.\n7. Heart- while the heart is part of the body it is used for pumping blood, which is carried by blood vessels. The brain lives in other organs and the organs, such as the heart live IN blood and blood vessels not actually IN the heart. So it can also be eliminated.\n8. Liver- the liver is part of the body however it is unlikely the brain would normally live inside the liver. The liver performs key body functions, and the brain lives in different body parts normally. So the brain also cannot live IN the liver.\n9. Bone- not normally, the brain lives in other parts of the body. In order for it to live in a bone, the bone would need to have a part inside of it, however this is unlikely.\n10. Brain- in order for the question to be answered the answer must be somewhere within the body, in this case it is the brain. No matter where the brain is located, it must exist in", "answer": " 11"}

{"text": "Input: What is the common shape for the bones of an arm? Choices:  a: octagonal b: square c: triangular d: circular e : rectangular\nRationales: The given statement \"What is the common shape for bones of an arm?\" needs to be answered using the options we are given and determining which of these options represents a common bone shape.\nTo answer this question we must first understand the terms used and determine what bone shape would be considered \"common\". Once we have these two details, we can begin to identify the correct answer.\n\nThe statements in the passage outline that the \"Octagonal\" bone is one that is formed like an eight-sided figure, a \"Square\" bone is one formed into a four-sided figure, \"Triangular\" bones are those that form a three-sided figure, and \"Circular\" bone refers to those that are round-shaped. Finally, \"Rectangular\" refers to the shape of a bone formed into a right-angled rectangle of sorts.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options completely encompass the \"Common shape for the bone of arm\". This is because the given choices are not a match for the octagonal, square, triangular, circular-shaped bones or the rectangular shaped bone.\n\nTherefore we need to understand that the bone that fulfills the criteria in the question is the \"Circular\" and \"Rectangular\" shaped bones. Thus out of the 5 options, the correct answer will be answer choice B.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: What does a \"stargazer\" usually do?

Choices: 1A. 3:2 1B. 3:2  5C. 3:3 1D. 3:3  5E. 4:2   1F. 5:1\nRationales: The question is asking about the probability of an event occurring in a group of 3 where the total number of occurrences of that event are 5.\n\n1. There are 5 total events, so the total number of combinations can be derived as 5 factorial = 5! = 120.\n2. All the occurrences in a group are different, so each will occur only once.\n3. In the first group of 4, there are two women and the remaining two are men.\n4. Using the formula for combination, total number of occurrences with two women in group of 4 would be = (C2_4)4! = 12! = 12*(24) [2*2*6*6*4*4]\n5. The same can be achieved with only one woman and three men.\n6. Hence the formula for the probability can be derived as = (5 choose 2)/(120) = 4/5 and option 1b is right.\n\nAnswer: 1b.

Have the parent do study -This option involves the parent doing research (study), which can help them gain further insights into the issue.\n   B. Ask the student - This option involves asking the student how he uses the computer, which could potentially result in both parties coming to a solution.\n   C. Have them discuss thoughts on a program - This option involves having both parties discuss thoughts on a program they feel strongly about.\n   D. Set a goal - This option involves setting a goal, but it doesn't specify what that goal could be specifically related to the computer.\n   E. Discuss what you are planning - This option involves having the parent and student discuss what they are planning on doing, which could potentially lead to resolving the issue regarding the computer.\n2. Overall, all of these options may help the parent and student resolve their issue, but option E, discuss their thoughts on a computer they both feel strongly about, provides a more specific resolution to the problem.\n3.

Based on the questions, we know that Dexter likes the color blue, and we need to determine what the object is.\n2. The blue object can be a part of either paint or nail polish. Hence, we can narrow down to either a paint bucket or a nail polish bottle.\n3. Dexter can't use a paintbrush or any other means of paint application with a paint bottle. Hence, we can eliminate 'paint' as answer option.\n4. If we remove paint from the picture, then we can say that a bucket full of nail polish comes before the color blue to get the paint polished. Hence, Dexter can' use a brush or her hands to apply nail polish. But she can't apply the color 'blue' to her nails by using her fingers due to the fact that it would be a nail polish.\n5. Dexter is left with the last option, ballpoint pen, wherein she can apply the color blue directly on her nails without the need for anything else.\nAnswer: E.

Choices:  D: accounting management  B: head of the store C: the job D: responsibility control manager\nRationales: The question asks about a decision made by a manager in regards to responsibility delegation. 1. \"The person in charge of quality\" is a potential answer. 2. This phrase implies that the role of quality control is either delegated or is being taken over by someone else. 3. This person cannot be a manager themselves. 4. We eliminate all the options except for \"In this case, the person in charge of the quality will be assigned the task of accounting management.\" 5. This is the best answer as it fits the description of the situation and makes sense. \"The one in charge\" is not an answer as they can't be assigned to a new responsibility and they will retain their current one unless it says that they will be assigned to perform quality control on the accounting side.\n\nAnswer: In this case, the person who handles quality control will be delegated to the position of accounting management, but not \"head of the store\" as they already have a job and it does not explain what they will do next. \"Responsibility control manager\" doesn't make sense either as it does not seem like the word control would necessarily be a part of the title since this manager is responsible for quality control in the first place. Also, it is not grammatically correct to call the person in charge of accounting or head of the store a responsibility control manager. So \"in charge\" does make more sense than \"control,\" and this is why the other two options don't work.\n\nInput: What does the writer wish will happen with him in his home state?

Choices: \nA: bookshelf, bed, chair B: baseball bat, bowling ball, ladder C: cabinet, door, fence D: cricket bat, table, window frame E: book cover, door, shelf\nRationales: Considering that wood is a material that can be used to make various objects, a fair approximation for answers can be inferred. For instance, a bookshelf is made up of many wooden parts. A bed also contains wooden parts. Likewise, a wooden chair can be considered as made of wood. A baseball bat, a bowling ball, a ladder, a cricket bat, and a wooden door all have wood as a main component.\nFurthermore, a cabinet, a table, and a window frame are all wooden objects. \nAnother approach to the question is to consider wood as a component in each of the given choices rather than a defining factor. If we do this, we see that while items C and D do contain wood as a component, items A, B, and E do not.\nThe last two items, fence and book cover can be ignored as not every wooden object contains them. \nLooking at the choices of wood as a component, the answer turns out to be A: bookshelf, base, door.

Option B: ahead, behind, ahead, also only includes 1 of 3 possible options, which is not sufficient.\n    3.)

What might this sadness be a sign of? Choices:  C: depression A: joy B: worry D: happiness E: rage\nRationales: The passage describes the woman (wearing purple) feeling sad in the car, and she is also angry at the driver of a black car.\nWith these clues, we can infer that she probably knows something that has caused her a great deal of emotional pain and stress.\nThis kind of knowledge or feeling would likely lead to intense sadness and some form of anger at the cause of said sadness or distress.\nNow moving onto the options, only one of them accurately reflects such an emotion: option D: happiness. If it was happiness then she would not have been angry at the black car. Happiness is the opposite of anger, so it is incorrect.\nSimilarly, option C: depression is also inaccurate as depression is opposite of happiness, but she would be feeling sad, whereas sadness is not the opposite of depression.

However,  a person with bad posture may have weak back muscles, but not weak skeletal muscles. Which does not cause back pain? Choices: \tA: weak bones B: weak skeletal musculature C: weak abdominal muscles D: weak back muscles E: weak skeletal joints \nRationales: We know that a person with bad posturerefers to a person whose posture is awkward or unhealthy. If a person with bad postureshas back pain, there is a possibility, that it can be caused by the skeletalmuscles or the abdominal muscles being weak.\nThe abdominal muscles are the muscles in the middle of the body, and can be found between the ribs and the pelvis.\nThe reason it is not C: weak abdominals, is because, if a person works out his abs, then he will become stronger overall. If the abdominal muscle does not cause the back pain, that the skeletal musculaturer refers to.\nThe skeletal musculaterefers to the large muscles that make up the bulk of a person\u2019s skeleton, usually associated with movement and locomotion.\nThe reason it cannot be option A: weak bonesis because, if the bones are weak, the person will get arthritis, and this condition is different.\nThe reason option D: weak back musclesthan weak bonesbecause, if you work out your back muscles, your back will get stronger and you will be more in shape\nThe person does not feel back pain because of what are weak bones.  Option E: weak skeletall jointsis not the best answer because there is no pain. There is no pain because it was stiff. The person should not have stiff muscles at all.\nThe reason D: weak skeletal jonethat it is the correct choice is for the same reason that the other two reasons why the one that does not cause back pain.

Choices:  a: the first grade, b: the twelfth grade, c: first year of high school, d: fifth grade, e: sixth grade\nRationales:1. The passage describes children being assessed at grade level when they are considered to be at grade level, implying that the evaluation must involve other children.\n2. To determine the grade level in the given context, we need to identify the grade level where most of the other children are.\n3. Considering this, the description of the assessment being done on all children at grade level in that country suggests that the country in question should have a particular type of grade system.\n4. We analyze various options given & find that, only option E: sixth grade fits well with the provided description as it specifically indicates the grade level where assessment of the child is done.\n5. Therefore, the answer to the question is'sixth' grade.\nAnswer: E : sixth grade\n\nInput: The teacher was trying to get the class moving. She asked her students to stand for math. What was she trying to get her students to do? Choices: 1. do math standing up, 2, move their bodies 3. move their bodies, 4. do math standing, 5. moving standing of\nRationales:\n1. The given information implies that the teacher is aiming to get her class to do'something' while standing.\n2. We need a verb that's broad enough to refer to a range of options that involve physically moving.\n3. Here, options 1 and 5, 'do math standing up' and'moving standing off' respectively don't describe these kinds of activities.\n4. We reject option 2 as'move their bodies' doesn't directly refer to standing.\n5. The teacher was 'trying to get the class moving' which means she is attempting to have them do something that involves moving, therefore, the teacher was aiming to get her students to'move'. Hence, the answer is'moving standing up'.\nAnswer: \nE : moving standing up\n\nInput: How was Paul feeling by the end of the week? Choices:", "answer": " 7"}

To answer this kind of question, we need to understand what the phrase \"who has the most money\" entails.\n2.\"Who\" is a pronoun that is used to refer to a specific person, place or thing, and\"has the most\" indicates possession.\n3.In this context, 'Who has the most money' refers to Adam or the dog.\n4.Let's now eliminate each option one by one.\n5.First, both of them (option C) is not an acceptable option as it is not an individual and does not possess any money, so this can be eliminated.\n6.Second, neither of them (option A) is also not an option as it states that neither person has any money, which is impossible, so this can be crossed out.\n7.Third, both of them (Option C) is an acceptable response as one could refer and say someone has the most money or something has the most money. This is true for dogs and it is also true for a combination of Adam + Dog so, this too can be crossed out. \n8.Fourth, neither of them (Option B) is also an acceptable response as one can say either someone does not have money or something does not have money and so, we can cross out that too.\n9.Fifth, the phrase \"them all\" (Option F) is not a grammatical sentence, so the option cannot be considered.\n10.So, there are only two remaining options out of the five - either Adam has the money (Option D) or the dog has the money.Since the question states that the dog is also there, we can cross out Adam is right and the dog is right (option D), and finally, we are left with the right answer choice as the dog has the money (option D).\n\nInput: Why are 19 things better than 10?

Choice B is incorrect because heat does not make bendable plastics, bake does. Choice C is incorrect because bake does not make bendy plastics, alcohol does, and heat will cause it to soften (melting). Choice D is also incorrect because adding sugar does not make plastics bendable. Finally, Choice E is incorrect because adding sugar does make bendable plasts, but adding alcohol does not.\nAnswer: C.

Choices: P: Horror movies Q: Science fiction movies R: Westerns S: Fantasy movies T: Superhero movies U: Romantic comedy movies V: Documentary movies W: Mystery movies Z: Musicals\nRationales: Inferences/Puzzles are often worded or framed in such a way that a hint or suggestion can be extracted from the question that eliminates incorrect answers. For e.g., movies in the question are referred to as \"what kind of movies\", which implicitly excludes one type of movie-- \"not all movies can be of this type(movie/film)\". Furthermore, movies which are \"action\" are referred to as \"action figures\", which implies that action movies do not belong to the category of movies in the question.\nAnswer:\nU: Romantic comedies\n\nInput: What was the most common first name?

A doctor is an individual who has completed medical school and received a medical degree in order to treat patients and diagnose ailments.\n2. The question asks us to determine what a \"doctor' looks like?\n3. Considering that the question excludes options that describe someone who is a specialist in dentistry or hairdressing but involves one who has completed medical school, we can eliminate options A, B, and E.\n4. The question only provides options that have a person as the root for the noun, and C (nurse), D (dentist), and E (hairdresser) have 'person' as roots.\n5.

We'll start by ruling out the impossible answers.\n3. Answer:0: We will begin by ruling out the answer marked with a zero. This is because the instructions say that we need to place a penny on a moving train, implying that the train is moving, and a penny on a stationary surface would not make sense.\n4. Answer:1: The next option is answer number one. We can reject this because the text states that you will place the coin in a moving train. A train's wheels spin as it moves, which would be inconsistent with this answer since the wheel with the top point cannot remain still.\n5. Answer:2: Now, we will analyze answer number two. Here, we can determine that a coin's value and the value of a train would likely match at a back car due to their positioning.\n6.

Choices:  B: the young couple is a newlywed  C: the young couple is getting ready for a date  D: the young couple is preparing for a meal  E: the young couple is expecting a baby\nRationales: \"Why was the young couple at this store?\" implies that the young couple is having an event at the store or there was some sort of special circumstance that required them to be there.\n\"Newlywed\" only provides a description of the young couple since \"Young\" can broadly refer to anyone, not necessarily recently married.\n\"Preparing for a date\" also doesn't match the details of the story since the young couple is \"getting ready\" for an important event and \"Couple\" is also an ambiguous term.\n\"Getting Ready for a Meal\" is similarly incorrect because the couple is \"getting ready for an important event\" in the story.\n\"Expecting a Baby\" can be correct as a possibility, but we need to make sure that the context confirms it, so let\u2019s see what we are getting told:\n1. The young couple is a married one.\n2. The young couple is getting ready to go somewhere.\n3. The young couple is not at a restaurant or meal, but at the store.\n4.

It\u2019s a traditional method of payment that\u2019s been around for centuries.  However, it\u2019s rarely used today in this form, as cash and coins offer more advantages in payment methods.\nDebit cards offer a convenient method of payment because they allow you to spend money you already have in your bank account.

E: It's uncertain.\n\nRationales: Option A: The correct answer is A, 'The water will start boiling'.\nThe word \"run\" in the statement indicates that something went wrong, and the water heater cannot fulfil its duty to provide the necessary amount of water at an ideal temperature.

Choices:1 A: Give them the definition of the word 2 B: I do not know C: The dictionary provides a definition D: Give a different word E: The dictionary contains the pronunciation of the word\nRationales:\n1. A person can go to the dictionary to find out the meaning of the word or the pronunciation of that particular word.\n2. The dictionary doesn't contain the pronunciation of this particular word, so we can safely rule out choice C: The dictionary provides the pronunciation of words.\n3. If a person isn't able to find the pronunciation, then giving him the meaning of the word is a logical choice, even if the person wasn't actually asking for the meaning of the word.\n4. If there is no pronunciation available in the dictionary, giving another word that means the same thing is a common response.\n5. The answer is D: Give a different pronunciation.\n\nInput: Which of these would be the best title for an article about a family's experience during a national crisis? Choices:1.", "answer": " 6400"}

Plan a group trip E.  Make a list\nRationales: First we will understand the question.\n2. It states a new way to organise a trip: A. Make a schedule, B. Plan a group travel, C. Find the right transportation, D. Plan a group trip, E. Make a list. These are all ways to organise a trip.\n3. We will now understand the clues, like: \"Schedules allow you to make a plan for where you are going and when you are going.\"\n4. To do so, we only need to understand what exactly does the mentioned word \"Schedule\" mean.\n5. We first see a \"schedule\" is an organised day which defines: \"The times at which specific tasks, errands, or other things must be accomplished.\".\n6. We can then determine that a schedule can also be another term for planning a group travel. There is no need for any further deduction. This means the answer is 'A.'\nAnswer:  B. Plan a group trip\n\nInput : I was looking forward to buying my very first toyota.\nChoice : A: car.B: auto.C: truck\nRationales: We simply need to look at the options provided - \"truck\" cannot be correct. There is no point in looking at the next option as this will only give us one more option that we don't need to spend our valuable time thinking about. So, the first thing we should eliminate is \"auto\". \n4. Now, looking at the next option - we realize that the passage does not use the term \"truck\" and that we are only left with one option to choose from. With our final option, we simply need to eliminate anything that doesn't make any sense and that wouldn't be correct.  So, we finally arrive at the option \"car\". Our passage contains the word \"toyota\", which is in the form of a car. Therefore, the final answer is \"car\" Choice : A: car.\nAnswer : A: Car\n\n# Explore different formats of AI \nInput: What", "answer": " 145"}

S III 10. S III 11. F V W III 12. B S I III 13. T B\nRationales: The question asks us to name the person who was leader of Confederate army and end with their family name and then choose the one who led it as a soldier in the American Civil War.\n1. The word Confederate is an adjective that shows or expresses a union between two or more groups or parties.\n2. They are a group of people who were against the government of the United state of America.\n3. The person can be anyone but their family name is always the last one so we can start the ending of the name with the initials or any alphabet from A-Z.\n4. Therefore in this question their surname is the most important part, therefore the answer is going to be S. Because all the answers have the same family name.\n5. But when we take the surname of Robert Edward Lee of Virginia we got a name that is C. VI. This means that Robert E Lee was a citizen of Virginia state but the answer should have only one surname and Virginia is not considered as a surname, so no answer is correct that's why no one can be the right answer.\n6. Thus, the name is going to be the first and last name, that is Robert E Lee.\nAnswer: C. VI\n\nInput: What can go in a water filter?

This does not address the premise of the question, which is why some beasts are not friendly.\n2.They are busy caring for families, This answer is not specific enough to explain why some beasts are unfriendly.\n3. They may not be friendly This is not an adequate explanation. Some beasts do not interact with other beasts for many reasons, and being unfriendly is just one of them.\n4. Their beastly mannerism do no allow them to be friendly to other beasts This is an acceptable answer because they are unfriendly, but it does not address the underlying reasons for their animosity.\n5.

(C) One has wings, and the other doesn't (D) The penguin lives in the sea, and the albatros lives on land.  (E) One lives in the South Pole, and the other lives in the North Pole\nRationales: Given statement: It seems that a penguin and albatross resemble each other, but they don't. A penguin lives in Africa, and the albatoss lives in the South Polean.\n1. We will eliminate those answer choices that are obviously incorrect.\n\nFirst, penguins are mammals. This means that they cannot be birds. This elimination is shown by answer choice B, which states \"One feeds on snow,...\"\n2. Second, it is not that albatrosses can't have wings, but this shows a lack of understanding of the facts about albatrosses, for most are only seen flying.\n3. The albatross is not a bird so the penguin cannot be a bird either, so answer choice A is the correct answer\n4. It is also said that the penguin lives in \"Africa\" which is incorrect, they don't actually live in Africa. However, the Albatross does live on a snowy location which is the north pole for the most part, so this answers the fact that the answer that they are birds for the most part.\n\nAnswer: D) The penguin live on an island called A, whereas the albatross lives in the North Polean E).\n\nInput: How do you get to the North Pole if you only have a map?

M: nine, two - Jack didn't have two people on his team.  This answer is obviously wrong.\n2. N: nine, eight - This answer says there were 17 people on Jack's team, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question.\n3. O: nine, six - This answer says there 15 people on Jack's baseball team which doesn't make much sense, especially because the context shows that he had an odd number of baseball players.\n4. P: nine, five - This answer is wrong, the question clearly states that there were 10 members in his baseball team, that is, it said there was nine, and six more members were brought in by the manager to make the team a complete group of 15 players. Clearly, as can be seen from the context, Jack had a baseball team of 10 players and 5 more brought in for the odd number, and this doesn't align with the answer of 9, 6.\n5. Q: twelve, four - This answer is actually an even number. To be an odd number, it should either be nine, five or seven, five as per the example in the sentence.\n6. R: fourteen, five - This answer clearly states that there were a total of 19 people in his baseball team, which doesn' t make sense according to the question context.\n \n\nThe answer is clearly Q : twelve, fourteen and here is the reasoning for choosing the answer :\n1. There were three teams of twenty players. Each team had nine, and six more as substitutes. Hence the total was ninety people.\n2.

The story talks about people that have gone through the portal. 5. The story is fictional.\nRationales:   1. The question asks how the first sentence relates to the story, which means that the sentence is important for the narrative.\n2. This means that it's not likely that the author is praising people and/or that the story is about gifted people.\n3. It's unlikely that the story discusses people and aliens.\n4. It's also unlikely that the story is about people who went through the portal, as the portal is only mentioned in the first sentence and thus doesn't directly relate to the story itself.\n5. The story isn't likely fictional, either, because that would directly contradict the question, which indicates that it's important for the story.\n6. Based on this information, the best answer is that the story talks about humans through whom the portal has had an impact. Hence, the answer is 4. The story is about those who have gone through the portal, which fits the description of the first sentence. Therefore, the answer to this question is the fourth item on the list, number 4.\nAnswer: B: The story is about people that went through the portal\n\nInput: Where is the entrance to the new park found?

We can exclude each of the above options by comparing with the option number 5 that is correct. Now let's discuss each of the above.\n\n1) This is incorrect as there is no mention of parking meter in the question. A parking garage is a long-term parking lot as its name indicates (garage). Parking meter is a device that measures the time, not parking garage. Moreover, we do not park our vehicles in a meter, rather we park them in a garage.\n\n2) This is incorrect because time is the measure of the parking time in the parking meter. No meter is required to measure time.\n\n3) This is incorrect because parking meter uses money to charge for using the parking lot. Parking garages do not use money to get paid.\n\n4) This is incorrect as parking meter uses energy to charge for running the parking lot, whereas, a parking garage uses meters", "answer": " 9"}

When thinking about next meal, it might be the dog thinking about someone else\u2019s meal or their own meal.\n4. Thinking that the dog can\u2019t escape is not a realistic thought.\n5.

Choices A: 1: puzzle B: 2: quilt C: 3: picture D: 4: toddler E: 5: mosaic\nRationales: The question asks for the relation between the pieces of the mosaic and we have the following clues.\nThe pieces are in the form of puzzle: 1:\nThe mosaic is made of different materials, such as: 2 and 4:\nThe pieces fit together like a puzzle: 5\nThe pieces represent various activities: 3 (i.e., it mentions that two of the five pieces represent children playing).\n  Based on these clues, one can infer that the pieces represent the activities of some children and the materials include one quilt and mosaic.  For the first 2 clues, one can observe that pieces 3 and 4 are made up of cloth (i.e., quilts), and pieces 1 and 5 are made up of a mosaic, which is a type of stone or tile on which the picture is made.\n  Based on the first two clues, one can deduce that the puzzle pieces represent the activities of children and the materials used include a blanket and a mosaic.\n  The mosaic and blanket suggest a type of art that was commonly used in the past: mosaic painting.\n    Therefore, the correct answer to this question is a mosaic.

By the nature of ice cubes, we can infer that they do not melt in this state, as boiling water is above the freezing point\n3. We can also infer that an ice cube can melt after being added to boiling water, as when ice is added to hot water it immediately begins to melt\n4. We can also infer from the question that an ice cube placed into boiling water will melt, as the question doesn't refer to other results that an ice cube would experience after being added to boiled water\n5. Therefore, an ice cube placed in a boiling water would melt, as it has a higher likelihood than the rest of the options.\nAnswer: A :It will melt\n\nInput: Which of the following are true about the process of elimination? Choices: \n1. It always takes place when making a selection 2. One can avoid going overboard 3. It could help resolve a conflict 4. It could be misleading 5.

When someone uses \"process of elimination\" they mean that they have a finite amount of choices from which they must choose one, and \"eliminate\" the choices they don't select. They would only choose one, the others are eliminated.\n2. It doesn't have to take place. You could potentially make a selection in no time or take a long time to reach a decision. The use of \"process\" implies a progression towards choosing.\n3. Eliminating potential options isn't the same as avoiding potential problems. You may eliminate problems to be able to make a choice, but that doesn't mean you would avoid problems.\n4. It isn't implied, so there is no reason to believe it's true.\n5. It also doesn't apply.

Choices:  a) Leave it in your pants\u2019 pocket. b) Give it away. c) Lay it on the ground. d) Lend it to a friend. e) Leave it on a shelf.\nRationales:1. The question asks us to describe something that a book should not be.\n2. The options that can be related to this are:\n   a) Leave it the hands of an author\n   b) Give it away\n   c) Lay it anywhere on the ground\n   d) Lend it away to someone else\n   e) Leave it under the pillow after resting in a bed\n3. As it\u2019s clear that the book cannot be taken away by others in any of these scenarios.\n4. Laying it on the ground is not an option as no author will leave their book on the ground to be trampled on, and this is more applicable for books that are out in public places where they become exposed to damage from inclement weather, humans, animals, and other environmental hazards.\n5. Another scenario is the book cannot be left in pockets as this will cause discomfort while wearing them and it also doesn\u2019t feel safe to keep an item like books in pockets, even when the owner is not on the move\n6. As for lending the book to friends or lending away a book to someone else, the authors are not concerned much whether books are stolen, lent away, or misplaced from booksellers.\n7. Hence, giving away the book falls under the criteria of not an appropriate answer, and lending away a book also does not meet it as being a part of a book does not make it lose its value, whereas lending for free is the act of losing the author\u2019s value.\n8. The book cannot be left under the pillow after being taken rest, as not all books are of that type to be left out of sight so that they can be used as reading material.\n9. If the book isn\u2019t lost, stolen, or even misplaced, then it most likely means that it\u2019s in the possession of the bookseller and the author has", "answer": " 3"}

The first bullet of the question indicates the use of the phrase \"the same ideas and phrases\". \n2. Now, one must ask the question: \"How do ideas and phrases differ?\". \n3. The difference lies exclusively in the fact that \"ideas\" represent the thought process of the author whereas \"phrases\" are simply individual chunks of words. \n4. Therefore, the use of one person's idea is distinctly different from simply borrowing their phrases. \n5.

Choices: 1: A: in another strip mall B: in a plaza C: on the highway D: in a different town E: on the waterfront\nRationales: This question is about finding an acceptable location for a candy store. Considering that the candy store has a bad reputation due to being located near a fast-food joint, we need to find another acceptable location for the store.\n\n1. In a strip mall. We can rule this option out since the store currently has a bad reputation due its location in a strip mall. Furthermore, while being in a stripmall can be acceptable for some businesses, it may be undesirable for a candy store to be associated with a fast-food restaurant.\n2. A plaza. A plaza is a pedestrian mall or shopping area encompassing multiple stores and services. While the location may provide a more pleasant shopping experience than a strip mall, a plaza could still potentially be undesirable to a candy store due to its proximity to a fast-food operation, especially considering the public perception of fast-food joints.\n3. On the highway. Highways are typically not suitable for a candy store as they are notoriously hostile environments due to high traffic volumes, noise, and air pollution. Furthermore, highway locations are typically unappealing due to their sterile and industrial appearance, as well as the lack of foot traffic and shopping opportunities.\n4. In a different town. This option doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee that the candy store would receive a reputation boost. A different town could still be a suitable location for a candy, but it may not be possible to move the store.\n5. On the waterfront. On the waterfront is not a suitable location for a traditional department store. Traditional retail environments do well in areas that provide easy access and parking options, so a candy store near a busy and loud waterfront may not be appealing to customers seeking a pleasant shopping experience.\n\nComment: I am very appreciative of this feedback and I find it immensely helpful.

Choices:  - A: monoplegic - B: bipedal - C: bicameral\n\nRationales: Considering the twins' right and left sides of the torso are both physically one and are conjoined, they cannot have the Bipedal condition, where individuals can walk normally and independently with two legs, which is typically what mono, and bicameral twins can have.\nIf the twins were born with both the right & left side of the tor-so, the condition would be Bicameral, the choice between the other two options, A: monoplegia (having only one fully functional limb) - The condition in which a person is born with one fully-functional (dominant) limb, and bipedal (having both upper and lower extremities) - The condition of having two of each extremity (the term biped is an adjective that describes a person's gait) would not really fit the conditions stated.\nHence, we could assume that the answer to this question is C: Bicameral. \n\nAnswer: C : Bicameral", "answer": " 820"}

Choices: 1: chop wood 2: climb a mountain 3: cut a tree 4: clean windows 5: dig a tunnel\nRationales: To analyze this question, we need to consider what an axe is and what it's used for.\n\nAn axe is a tool that has a blade with one side that is sharp for cutting and the other that is flat or round for hammering. This makes it suitable for chopping wood as well as shaping metal or stone when used as a hammer.\n\nThe information provided in the question helps us conclude that we can eliminate the options that involve climbing mountains and digging tunnels. Although an axe might be used for these things, these things are not the main purpose of the axe.\n\nFrom the options we can conclude that option 2 is incorrect as chopping is not the main use of an axe. This is also based on the fact that chopping wood is not one of the main uses of the axe. It can be used for other purposes than chopping wood, such as working metal.\n\nOption 1, 3, and 5 cannot be the main thing that you can do with an axe because they are not uses of the axe itself. It is not the purpose of the axe to climb mountains or cut trees, nor is chopping wood an essential use.\n\nHence, the main use of an Axe is to Chop wood, that is it\u2019s main intention & purpose.\nAnswer: 1: Chop wood\n\nInput: What type of fish is commonly hunted by other fish and is not endangered?

Restaurant owners typically would choose to include sushis in their food selection to: \n   A. include a type of traditional cuising, which is the kind of cuisine that a particular culture traditionally prepares to eat. \n   B. because it is a trendy dishes, which are foods that have recently become popular due to their novelty, convenience, or other appealing features.\n   C. because they are offering what the people want, meaning that it is the popular demand of consumers in which restaurant owners decide their food items in restaurants.\n   D. to cater to the taste of customers and make their restaurant more popular by giving consumers what they want to eat.\n   E. because it is a unique type of cuising which is not commonly seen on restaurant menus but might be offered by some restaurants to provide customers with something out of the ordinary.\n   F. because it is an inexpensive item, which means that it is a food that can be purchased at a low price and therefore is popular among consumers due to its affordability.\n3.

The correct answer is \"After the Judge's remarks\". When will a judge call the jury into a case? We can reason that it is after they've delivered their remarks. 2. The first two answers (I and A) can't work because they would mean a judge calling the jury in before they even started!\nThey definitely don't do that! 3. B is wrong for the same reason: the judge doesn't call them to the trial until it's about to start. But C is correct: you have to be called to jury duty in advance - before the trial begins!

I don't know that phrase.\nRationales: In this question we are looking at how people use or don't use certain phrases and what might be different about their use or disuse of the phrase \"I do not like that dress\".\nFirst and foremost, phrases are different from words as the former are made up of multiple words while the latter are mono-syllabic. Also, phrases do not have one singular meaning as they often mean different things in different phrasal contexts depending on the meaning of the adverb, preposition, or determiner in that context.\n\nThe given statement suggests that the person does like the given phrase, however, they are using it wrongly by saying \"I don't care for\" that phrase. This means that they do not prefer to use that phrase and hence, they should use the correct phrase with the correct word(s) in that context. \"I don't prefer to\" uses the adverb \"not\", whereas, \"I don't use\" uses the preposition \"to\".

This leaves us with three options that can possibly be any form of colours, namely, red, black, and orange.\nConsidering the context of the given question, there can be two possible conclusions:\n```\n1.

This rationale gives an insufficient answer, as it doesn' only indicate that an engineer designed an airplane, but doesn't address why they designed it for 80 people only.\n2. The answer refers to the environment and does not give any reason for why the engineer designed an airplane that was less efficient than what it could potentially have been.\n3. This rationale is similarly vague and offers no explanation for why an engineer would design a plane for 80 people with limited materials rather than something that could potentially transport more people.\n4. This rationale fails to provide any explanation for why the engineer designed a plane with reduced capacity and is also vague.\n5. This rationale does not provide an argument to support the engineer's decision not to design a plane that could potentially carry numerous citizens.\n6. This rationale provides no explanation for the engineer's choice to design an airplane only for limited capacity rather than creating something that could potentially carry lots of people.\n7.

(Sounds like a scary story to a scared Aunt and a scared brother)\nSister and Brothet.\nLikewise, when considering Cousin and Nephew, we also recognize that they are better inserted in a comical context.\n'My Aunt is ________ (like my Sister) and I am __________________ (like your Brother).' Also, it sounds like a funny joke.\nNephew and Cousin.\nThe last two options; Nephew and Cousin seem to be not very funny options. \nWe therefore opt for option Sister as it makes a funny joke with words of similar sound.\nHowever, if we do change the order of the letter 'S' and remove it.\nIt will form a perfect comic sentence: 'Hey, Aunt _______, I have a joke for you!

The question asks for a type of candy bar that a person who does not eat chocolate could eat.\n2. The passage provides information on two sets of candy bars, one that is chocolate and one that is non-chocolate.\n3. The option 'd.' must be considered since it states that someone who eats non-chocolate candy bars is the same as someone who eats 'any' candy bar.\n4. Consequently, we can narrow the options down based on the clues that we have.\n5. A non-chocolate bar is a no-chocolate bar as it refers to a candy bar that is 'not' chocolate. Now, the given options consist of a bar that is not chocalate and any candy bar. Therefore, as per d., the person can eat a non-chocolate or any candy bar. Hence, the answer remains 'd.'.\n6.

Choices: 1. A: 12 minutes  B: 12 days  C: 12 hours  D: 6 hours  E: 12.4 mins \nRationales:\n\n1. The question asks:\nIf a man & a woman ride their bikes 736 m (a distance) in the same direction\nIt takes (how long) hours for the man than the woman\nIt will take them?(how long) hours to ride 7316 m\n2. The correct answer is C. 12 hours\n\n3. Why is the correct response C, 12 hours, and not the more obvious choice of A, 12 minutes?  \n4. Rationales:\nThe man rides 16 mph (faster) than the woman, which we can express as (736m)/x = (4030m)/y, where x and y are the speeds. We rearrange by grouping the quantities to (4030)(1/y) = (736)(1/x), which gives us y = x * 7.

Therefore, we need to exclude all the options except choice B, and look for terms used to describe the sequence of wearing different types of shoes.\n3. In this case, left is an adverb, which tells us in what order the mentioned shoe is put on.\n4. In the question's sentence, we can exclude the option \"both\", which is an adjective and doesn't refer to the sequence, but to the properties of the mentioned shoe.\n5. There is no direct grammatical connection with choosing \"left\" instead of \"right\".\n6. Hence, for the answer, we choose \"left\", since it's the most accurate and exact way of answering this question.\nAnswer: B. left\n\nInput: Where do you place your finger when you do a salutation? Choices:  C: in front of your chest B: in front of your forehead D: on the table F: over your eye E: over your shoulder\nRationales:  1.

A salutation is often done by a group of people, so we can eliminate the options 'in front of your forehead' and 'over your eye'.\n3. We need to remember that if there are no given examples, we cannot make assumptions about what the author could mean.\n4. In this case, none of the remaining options provide examples of what is meant by salutation, therefore it is inaccurate to assume that they fit.\n5. The only viable option from the remaining options is the one that says you should put your finger 'in front of your chest'.\n6. This is the only answer that provides an example of when you can use this gesture - for salutation or greeting.\nAnswer: C. in front of your chess", "answer": " 100"}

Lose a Passenger \u2013 unless of course the passenger is unwilling to travel further to the appropriate airport.\n   4.

It is usually divided into three categories:\n\n1. **External Load**: information that is required from the outside environment and is typically short term memory, such as facts, figures, etc.\n2. **Internal Load**: information which one must think about, such as strategies, procedures, and procedures, etc.\n3. **Working Memory**: a limited amount of short term storage for information and tasks. It is one type of memory that can be recalled.\n\nIn this case, only two types of cognitive load are relevant: external load and working memory load.\n\nExternal Load: The external load in this question is the number of entities that the student must keep track of. A human brain does not have an unlimited ability to hold information in memory. Thus, students are advised to only keep track of five things. The more entities a person must remember, the more strain the person's external load places on their memory. This is a common issue in students and one that contributes to a reduced efficiency and productivity in their study.\n\nWorking Memory Load: The working memory load is the number of things that the mental representation can hold in memory at one time. According to cognitive science, the human mind can only hold approximately seven \"chunks\" of information. The more information the student has to remember, the more strained a student's working memory becomes. As a result, the student will become fatigued.\n\n### Reasoning: Cognitive Load\nThe student has to remember five terms in this question. To remember this, a student needs to divide the term into its constituent parts. In terms of the terms, they are all distinct \"things\" or \"entities\". In other words, they are not concepts or ideas. All you need to do is to come up with a mnemonic to remember them. You do not need to understand what these terms mean. They are simply discrete elements. Thus, in order to remember each term, you need to create a unique mental representation for each term. Doing so puts one's working memory load at a high.\n\n### Solutions: Cognitive Load \nAs the student can recall that the list", "answer": " 15"}

Choices:  B: an orderly workstation C: no break D: a chance to take a break E: better results after lunch\nRationales:\n  1. The question asks which choice can a manager get if she wears her work hat. \n  2. It should be noted that the terms 'hat' and 'work hat' can signify different things, and can also be different from the terms 'wear' and 'put on'. \n  3. We may take the information given to understand that for the question above, the term 'wear' means to 'put on' and for 'work hat' the meaning is 'to put on/wear the hat for work'.\n  4. The following reasons, in our opinion, can be used to support our decision on the correct answer: \n     a. The idea that 'putting on one's work hat' can lead to receiving a chance to take a lunch break is not supported by our understanding of the term 'work hat', since putting on the work hat means the opposite of taking a break.\n     b. Similarly, the idea that it can lead to better results after lunch is not supported by our interpretation of the term work hat.\n       - Putting on the work hat usually signifies a change/shift in one's mindset, which cannot lead to better results as this would be based on factors not related to the put on of work hat.\n      \n\n     c. Lastly, the idea that putting on the work hat can lead to getting an orderly workstation is not supported by our perception of the term 'workhat'. The concept of workhat can be correlated to taking work seriously, and not to achieving a neat and orderly station.\n      \n     d. Therefore, the idea of putting on the work hat leading to getting a chance to take a work break, better results after lunch, and a neat and orderly work station cannot be considered.\n       It should be noted that despite all reasons that do not support the idea of \"putting on the work hat\" leading to \"better results after lunch\" and \"a neat and orderly workstation\" the sentence can still be true but without this understanding. \n       However, the sentence can be true without this understanding because other", "answer": " 2000"}

Car\nThis option is ruled out because it does not clearly fit the situation.\nOption E is a tool with significant benefits, and cars still remain the primary mode of transport across the world.\n\nFrom here on, option E and C are the only remaining options.\nThe next step is to select an option that will cause the company to become second best.\n\nC. Vacuum\nThe term vacuum refers to empty space, which does not really fit the situation described in the first paragraph: \nIf a new company enters the market with a device that is better than the previous, it is not likely that the public still chooses the second-best thing.\n\nE. Computer\nFrom the information provided, we can conclude that this option is the best answer.\nThe first paragraph talks about an invention, not a device, so it only makes sense if the item is the popularity and not the quality of the invention that made the difference.\n\nAnswer: E: Computer\n\nInput: In school, what does the 6th period mean?

The given statement makes us understand that women and men are not of the same gender.\n2. Now let's analyze what differentiates them to arrive at logical conclusions.\n3. Here we observe that all the given options are adjectives which define a person's temperamental, emotional and passionate characteristics.\n4. Hence none of them is different from the other.\n5. The question demands one to define what distinguishes men from women.\n6. In the given passage there is a mention of term temperament, so considering the options for this one the most plausible and fitting one is C: passionate. This option is quite sufficient and unique to distinguish men and women.\n7. It is worth mentioning here that though a woman can be passionate, an emotional or a temperate person, option E: emotional cannot possibly define woman as men, too, can be emotional.\n8. Thus, we can conclude that option C: passionate is the only one that fits the description well and differentiates women from men.\nAnswer: C passionate\n\nInput: What is the main reason people want to go to the beach? Choices:  _____ A: to see the ocean B: be on sand C: to relax D: to swim E: to build sand castles\nRationales:   1. Given that the question is about the reasons people go to the beach is to provide an answer that will fit those reasons or to select an option that would be likely to be chosen.\n2. Out of all the given options, 'to see the ocean' does not fit the asked scenario which says that people go to the beach. The ocean can be seen from some distance, or it can be reached after a few trips via a boat. However, being on sand does not answer this question and cannot be selected.\n3. 'To relax' can be a possible reason many people might choose and is a possible answer. People are in pursuit of relaxation all the time. However, that idea is not specific to the beach, the people can get this feeling anywhere there is a sunny environment.\n4. 'To swim' is an interesting answer", "answer": " 121"}

The question is asking for a game where players get know one another.\n2. Chess and card games don't help players get to know one other.\n3. Board games allow players to roll dice and move their figurines around a game board. This encourages social interaction between players.\n4. Charades is a game where players act out a certain word or quote to the other players, challenging them to guess what the player is trying to convey. Players must work together in order to solve the puzzle.\n5. Charades fosters conversation and interaction between players, leading to a more satisfying understanding of one another.\n6.

Choices: A: concertmaster   B: music director   C: conductor D: composer   E: violinist\nRationales: The question asks which of the following is in charge of organising the city orchestra. We will eliminate unwanted options and end up with the desired one.\n1. The concertmaster does not perform and the composer is not in charge of the city orchestra.\n2. The concertmaster does play but is still not in charge of organising, so he cannot be the answer for sure.\n3. If we eliminate the concertmaster as an option, we are now left with 4 names of people in charge of the city orchestras.\n4. These are as follows and are ordered in an intuitive way.\n  a) music director (this is someone who organises the music for the city orchestra) hence it can be eliminated.\n  b) The conductor (this is someone who directs the music while it is being performed, they cannot be in charge of organisation of the city orchestra)\n  c) The composer (creates music for the city orhcestra)\n  d) The violinist (a performer of the city orchestra, which does not put them in charge of organising it)\n5.

An assistant: Dentists often consult their assistants for advice and support, but this option does not include any other authority on patient care. It also does not provide any further clarity about the consultation, such as the subject of the consultation or who initiates the conversation.\n2. Specialist: This option does not specify that the specialist is a dentist, or that the consultation involves patient care, as it only specifies that they are a dental specialist.\n3. Intern: While interns may be involved in dental practice and patient care, it does not answer the question. It does not specify who is consulted about patient care, or who initiates the consultation.\n4. Dentist himself: A possibility is that in the course of patient care, a dentist may consult himself. For example, he may review the patient's medical history or consider the clinical procedure required to treat them.\n5. Attorney: Legitimacy checks usually involve patient history checks with the help of medical attorneys, and there is no mention of an attorney being consulted regarding patient care in the question.\nConclusion: The only option that covers both the consultation of another expert, who could initiate the conversation, and be asked for advice is option D (Dental Assistant).

Choices:  animals in nature A: cages B: pets C: food D: large E: small\nRationales:\n1. We need to identify a scenario that makes it a zoo.\n2. We eliminate the choices that don't constitute a zoo.\n   A: animals in nature - the question asks about caring for large animals, so this option doesn't fit the description.\n   B: pets - pet owner and pet do not fit the description, we can't rule out pets but we still can\u2019t say that such businesses require a zoo.\n   C: food - foods require care, but this doesn't make a place a zoo.\n   D: large - large animals also need caretakers, just like small ones, it is not necessary to have a large place on its own.\n   E: small - similarly to large animals, small animals need caretakers too, so such an environment doesn\u2019t make a place a true zoo.\n3. We examine the remaining choices, and notice that: C: food - food needs caretakers.\n   D: Caretakers take care of food.\n   E: Small - small things require caretakers, it is not necessary that caretakers are taking care of large things and vice versa.\n\n4. A person who takes care of the things that need caretakers is a caretaker regardless of the kind of food or things needing care.\n5. A zoo is a place where people take care large animals that can\u2019t stay on their own, so it is only the food that people need caretakers of: food, not pets, not animals in nature, not large and not small things.\nAnswer: D-Food\n\nInput: What is the name of the 18th President of the United States?

He might come back. 3. He went to the store. 4. He might be lost. 5. He might be sleep\nRationales:    1. Option 1 - He must live here doesn't make sense in the context since we're describing a problem our dog has which involves him being lost. The \"must\" also indicates it's a requirement, which is not accurate in this situation.\n2. Option 2 - He might come back does not explicitly give us any information on his location or provide us with any leads about what happened to the dog. This can be discarded.\n3. Option 3 - He went to the store does not seem to be a natural response of the man who asked us the four options. Also, the \"might\" does not reflect the specificity required by the problem.\n4. Option 4 - He might be lost gives us the idea that our dog might be lost and the man also speculates whether the dog went to the store for a reason. This is the correct answer. Hence, the answer is 4: He might be lost.\nAnswer: 4: He might lose", "answer": " 160"}

The question asks for the right time when Caleb and the speaker will go to the movies.\n2. Therefore, we should identify a time that could be applicable for Caleb and the person speaking to go to the movies together.\n\n3. Option A: Tomorrow doesn't make sense since it's not today nor the next day. Furthermore, that option indicates a potential agreement to go to the moviethe next day, it doesn't signifies the time when they'll actually go to the movies today.\n\n4. Similarly, option D: Today does not suggest the correct answer either. A movie can only be watched during evening or night time. Therefore, this option cannot be correct if we consider that a movie is a nighttime activity.\n\n5. Options B: Saturday and E: never are eliminated since they don't specify a particular date.\n\n6. Option C: 2: 00 AM indicates that they are planning to go to the moviefrom 2:00 to 4:00 AM the next day.

However, options 4 & 9 are not related to the act of jailing someone.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is option 3.\nOptions 4 and 9 are eliminated because they do not mention a crime committed by which the person was imprisoned while option 3 outlines that the person committed a crime for which she was punished by imprisonment. \n\nIf we eliminate each option until we're left with a single option, then the answer is that crime.\nAnswer: 3. \"theft\"\n\nInput: What types of cars are easy for burglars?

The person working at a restaurant could involve various roles, especially as it requires people in different professions, such as waiters, cooks, managers, and others.\n2. Therefore, the answer must be a generalized statement concerning all the professionals involved in restaurant operations rather than an individual job, such as the waiter bringing food to the table or the chef in the kitchen.\n3. There are three options, each of which matches the role of different kinds of people working in different areas of a restaurant, such as waiters cleaning tables, cooks preparing food, and delivery drivers taking orders to customers.\n4. Among the options, the delivery driver (option C) covers most of the tasks related to delivery and transporting food.\n5. Also, the job of a cook (option B) includes preparing food as well as handling food.\n6. The cook (B), food (B), delivery driver (C), and waiter (A) all refer to different kinds of services provided at a restaurant, but only C: Delivery Driver (option C) covers the entire menu and matches the most relevant task of a person working at a restaurant. Hence, the answer is option C. The person who works at a restarunt can be either the waiter A, chef B, or delivery driver C.

Choices: A: noun, verb, adverb B: subject, verb, direct object C: noun, verb phrase, sentence D: subject, verb phrase, clause E: prepositional phrase, adjective, clause\nRationales: This is a basic test question about English grammer. There are 3 parts that make up a complete sentence and they are noun, verb and adverb. A sentence consists of a noun(e.g., subject, pronoun, or noun clause), a verb (e.g., a form of be used in place of a noun), and usually some form of an adverb (e.g., adjective, adverb).\nIn this task, B answers \"subject, verb, direct object\" which refers to noun, verb, and prepositional phrase, and D answers \"subject, verb phrase, clause\", which refers to noun phrase, adjective, and verb. While C refers to noun, pronoun, prepositional phrase, verb phrase, sentence, adverb phrase, or adjective phrase, and E refers to verb phrase, adjective, prepositional phrase.\nSo the answer is A.\n\nInput: How are people transported to space?\n\nRationales\nFirst we analyse each sentence separately. As the sentence is written with the passive voice and it is unclear who initiated the action (a person or an object) who \u201ctransported people to space\u201d, there are three parts in the sentence, the verb, the subject and the direct object.\n(i) transported \u2013 to carry people from one point to another. The sentence refers to people who travel to space. So the subject in the sentence is \u201cpeople\u201d.\n(ii) to space\n\u2013 it is a prepositional phrase used to indicate the space that the people travel to.\n\nSo the structure of sentence is subject (noun) + verb (transitive verb) + direct object (noun).\nThus, the answer is D.\n   \nInput: What do they use to catch someone who is stealing or murdering?\n\nRationals\nThe meaning is clear as the question asked", "answer": " 304"}

The question refers to foods which are not from Greece so eliminating other categories of food is also ruled out.\n2. After elimination, the option with the Greek name spinach is ruled out because the food items cannot have a Greek name to be eligible for the list.\nAn olive is not from Greece nor does Greece produce enough olives to sustain the demand of the entire world.\n\n3.

Choices:  A. no longer than one hour B. no longer than two months C. no later than one night D. not longer than thirty seconds E. no longer than one month\nRationales:  1. The question asks what the recommended time frame is for a child to call emergency services after an accident.\n2. We need a specific time frame that is applicable to a child who is calling 911.\n3. Considering this, it's unlikely that the answer would refer to a child who is older than one month.\n4. It's unlikely that a child would wait more than two months to call 91, especially in the case of an accident.\n5. Similarly, it's unlikely for a child under the age of one year might still be awake at 1 AM, and calling 911 wouldn't be the wisest choice, as the emergency operator might not be able to attend to the child.\n6. However, it's possible that a child wouldn't wait more than one month to call 91.\n7.

Prescription medications usually require a recommendation from a doctor or another medical staff member and are then administered by the nurse to the patient depending on their health condition.\n3. In fact, most of the work that nurses do is related to patient assessment, communication between the patient and the physician or medical staff, following the treatment plan, etc.\n4.

Is this true or false?   A: False B: True C: True \nRationales: To understand the problem, we have to know the definition of the price of a restaurant. It refers to the cost of items and services on the menu.\n1. The question asks if the statement regarding paying the bill relates to the price point of the restaurant. The statement is not clear in terms of cost, and it can be either correct or incorrect.\n2. To interpret the statement, we need to look at the options.\n   A: False \u2013 This is correct if the price of an item is paid immediately, that is, if it is paid in advance. However, this is unlikely to be the case in a restaurant. Restaurants typically offer payment options such as dining in, pickup, or delivery. If you do not pay for your meal on the table, then you are not paying for that meal.\n   B: True \u2013 This is the most incorrect statement if people pay the bill at the restaurant. However, if you take into account that price points are only one of a variety of payment options, paying the bill does relate to the cost per item. Therefore, it cannot be declared as false.\n   C: True \u2013 Based on the information given, paying the bill is an accurate representation of the price point since people can pay in either cash or credit and can also change their order if they do not want to eat anything they have ordered.\n3. Considering that it is possible that in restaurants customers do pay at the table, it is the most accurate to say the option C: true. The price point of a restaurant includes all payment options, and customers can usually still change their orders even if they do not pay the cashier on the table. That means paying the bill accurately represents the price point.\nAnswer: C True\n\nInput: Which team won the most Olympic medals during that time?

Choices: A: in a limousine B: in her car C: on the bus D: by taxi E: on a horse\nRationales: A car is a self-propelled vehicle used to carry passengers and is typically driven by a single person. It has four wheels and is equipped with a steering wheel, brakes, headlights, windows, doors, seats, and a trunk. A bus, on the other hand, is a public vehicle typically used to transport groups of people or passengers. In the context, the author traveled to a concert by the band, the Beatles, which happened to be in 1965, the same year as the movie \"Help!\" was released.

Choices:  a: Copenhagen b: Tokyo c: Sydney d: Hong Kong\nRationales:\n1. This question can be split into two main parts. The first part asks us about a bus stop and what city it is in. The second part asks us to use the clues we have to answer which city that bus stop is located in.\n2. The bus stop is described as being in a city that is quite busy and always full of people.\n3. This suggests the city is perhaps in Asia or an African country, because those are the only continents with countries that can relate to this description.\n4. We do know the country, however, so the answer can be narrowed down to the city of Hong Kong.\n5. This is because Hong Kong's streets can feel very busy as it has many people living there, and there are some very busy streets in this city.\n6. It is also quite a large city, so there would be a 24-hour stop for the city bus service. \n7. Finally, Hong Kong is a very populated city, particularly its streets, so it would often appear to be full of people with lots of activities and people coming and going\nAnswer: D: Hong Kong\n\nInput: How do you get to a concert?

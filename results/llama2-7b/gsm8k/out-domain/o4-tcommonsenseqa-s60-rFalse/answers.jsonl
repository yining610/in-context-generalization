Everyone on the train jumped up in alarm. What number might have been on the clock when the train stopped if everyone on his train had an average age of 62?\nOutput: We can use addition to find the number in the denominator and divide the remaining number in the numerator by these values if we think the train arrived at 6 am and it took an average of 508 years, therefore 22,340 years total (508*2208).  To solve it, first, we have to find the value in the denominator. If the average is 62, it suggests that 1 out of 16 people on the train is still a baby, that is, under 1, so there is at least one baby on the train. This means we can get the number of the denominator by adding 16 to 1(this is the number of babies). Therefore: $$22,341 - 62$$  Divide that by that number by 2, we can come up with 16% left. Multiplied by 0.016, divide it by 0.001, we can find that is the number right before 8, so it would be 80 years(0.001/22,34).", "answer": " 123"}

The question itself is quite difficult, without \nbeing overly complex, and it's clear that the final answer isn't \nobvious without solving the math. To solve this problem, one would \nhave to be familiar with understanding different fractions, \ndecimals, and percentages and how they all relate to each other.\n\n### Question:\n\nWhat did the old lady go through?\n\n### Answer A\n\nThe lady went through the front door.\n\n### Justification\n\nThis statement is not the answer. We know that if the old lady went to the indoor playground, she would have to have pass through the zoo \nor the jail cell, because they are both inanimate parts of the playground area. It is not until we see that the front door is an inanimate part \nof an indoor playground area that we know that she would have to have passed through the front door. Answer D would work in the case where \nthe answer to the question is about an outdoor playground.\n\n### Option B\n\nThis statement is a correct answer. The lady went through the zoo, since she went through the front door, and the zoo was also part of the outdoor playground. \nBecause we see from that she went through the zoo, the only option is that the indoor playground was the zoo. Option A is incorrect since it \nwould be a part of the outdoor area that would not contain any animals or people. Option D is incorrect because the answer would be true, but \nnot the best answer.

The answer that gave a 9 was actually wrong. You must follow the example given and not the advice given. \n\nThe example that should do to answer the last question was to have the \"students\" create the answers using logic. In this example, the answer to the question is \"Grade 9.\" So students should \"Ask the audience. This question is for the teacher.\" The solution shown is for the first four lines of a movie to equal the first four of a song except for the 4th which is removed. The second line that is the same is the second line, and in the 3rd, the 4th, and the 5th, the middle is removed. The first and fourth lines in each are the same letter count.

{"text": "The answer is 4\n(The answer comes from this explanation)\nThis problem involves more than just addition and subtraction. If Caleb filled up his bucket in 1 trip and Cynthia did in 12 trips, then the spigot was pouring 43, not 63, gallons of water a trip. When you figure the number of trips each would have to make to fill their buckets, you subtract 7 from 63, because 7 gallons went into Caleb's bucket on a trip that got 63 gallons into the bucket. Then you subtract 8 from 83, which is the same deal as before. Now you need to divide the number you get by 2. When you get 4, you know it takes 4 trips for Caleb and 5 extra trips for Cynthia.\n\nInput: If you want to get from point A to point B, how much money would you have to give to the cab driver?

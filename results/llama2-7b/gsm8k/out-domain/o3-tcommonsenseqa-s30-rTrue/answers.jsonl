The phone was then returned to me, intact. \n\n### Demo : \nInput: The phone was missing for an hour\nRationales: The question is about a mobile phone that was lost in a park. When we said it missing, there were no indications that it is in the possession of anything else. Therefore, we have to assume he meant it physically missing, which can only happen during the time he lost his mobile phone, before then we would assume it is still in possession of its owner.\n\nInput: The phone is intact\nRationales: If a mobile phone is returned to its owner, it must be in its original, undamaged state. The phone needs to be intact for that to be true, that is, there is no damage such as it cracked.\nInput: He then returned to me,\nRationales: He returned the phone back to me indicates that he is the owner; otherwise, he would not send the phone to its original owner.\n\nAnswer: The phone was in the possession of the person who had lost the phone, who, upon finding it again in the park, returned it physically undamaged and in one piece, its original owner.\nInput: \nThe person who stole the cheese was given a long time to make an answer, but he didn't.\nDemo : The cheese was stolen by someone, who was given a long time, but he/she didn't make an answer.\n\nIn the following text that describes a task, make a response that appropriately\ncompletes the request.\nInput: A man came to see the manager the other day.", "answer": " 35"}

Choices: A: five B: three C: eight D: six\nRationals: 1.The question is asking how many apples each person has left at home, \n2. A person keeps half the apples at home:  H1 = H2; H1 + H2 = 10, \nH1 = 10 / 2, \nH1 + H2 =10\n3. An individual has one apple in the other person's home:  H1 + (H2-1) = 10 + (H2-2),\n4.

So 4+4 is 8, the number of hours it took the people tot work for.\n\n### Input:(The problem above is a very specific case and not representative of typical maths questions.)\n\n### Response:(The given question describes several people filling a 6000-block truck at the rate of 600 per hour. This rate is applied to both workers and can either be two or four. To solve the problem, you can easily calculate all the time each worker needs to finish one-fifth of the task, and then combine them to find out the total. This way is straightforward yet not necessarily the most effective method.)\n\n- 2 workers (4 hours) + 8(4 hours) = 16 hours -> 16/4 of the truck was filled within 4 hours\n- 8 workers (2 hours) + 8 (4 hours) = 24 hours -> 24/4 of the trck was filled in 4 hours\n\n### Response (This approach is a more efficient way of solving similar problems since calculating all times for all workers can be time-consuming and error-prone.)\n\n- Start by adding the length of time that either two or four workers can finish a fifth of the 6000 stones: 250/16/4 and 250/8/4, respectively.\n- Note that there are equal amounts of workers to complete the same task.\n- The result is 16.6 hours spent on either two simultaneous workers or 12.5 on four of them.

Now we have to find 660 divided by 1.2 to get the answer, so you have 550/1.2 which will result in 458.33 when you take the answer and convert it to a decimal. \n\nNow we subtract 550 from 458.5 to get the original height of the B package plants and we obtain 191.5 since 191.25 would be rounded down to 191 so we are given 8 thousandths to use in our 20% ratio and so we round 191.75 up to 192 inches then take 660 and divide it by 1.2 and subtract 550.

The total gallons of water used is then 12+8=20.\n\n### Input and analysis:The test has 20 multiple-choice questions. If one of the questions is wrong, the test taker must guess the correct answer from the available options. The test taker must take a minute to think about each question before answering. For every answer, the test taker is required to write a short essay describing the rationale for their answer choice and providing evidence to support their reasoning. The final score for the test is an average of the total points earned for each question on the test.\n\n### Example answer:For each multiple-choice question, the test taker only needs to select the correct answer from the provided options. Therefore, to calculate the average of the total points that will be earned for each question on a math test, we can simply divide the total number of points by the total number of questions.\n\nUsing this reasoning, we can calculate that the individual is likely to earn 20 points multiplied by 0.6, which is 12 points, for each multiple-choice question. Based on this, we can predict that the average score for a test on which only the multiple-choice questions will be answered correctly will be 12 out of 20.\n\nHowever, there is a possibility that some of the questions will be answered incorrectly, and in this case, it is more likely that the test taker will guess the correct answer from among the available options rather than spend an entire minute trying to determine what the correct answer would be or writing an essay based on insufficient knowledge of the subject matter. In this scenario, the final score for the test would likely be lower than 12 out of a possible 20 points.\n\nAnswer: If the test taker answers all questions correctly, they can expect to earn 12 points out of 20 for each question on a test with 20 multiple- choice questions.

The full height is one third inch less than 5 feet, so Larry and Barry could reach up to 20/3 inches or one sixth of Larry's full heght.\n\n### Rationales\n\nThe question asks \"How high can they reach?\"  Thus, Larry stands on Barry\u2019s shoulders, their combined height reaches a height that is half a inch less than full height or 1/6 of full height.\n\n\n### Input\n\nHow could someone become a criminal investigator?

Since the question is about what helps with the memorization of 8 x 12, it makes sense to assume that they will need something to remember 8 x 13, 8 x 14, 8 x 20, 8 x 30 etc. as these are all examples of multiplication facts that are equivalent to 8 and 10 which is what they wanted to memorize.\n\nThe provided choices are:\n1) A: multiply the last figure (last digit)\n2) B: double the last figure (last digits)\n3) C: subtract the last figure from 8 (12-8=4)\n4) D: add 8 (12+8=23)\n5) E: add 13 and subtract 8\n\nAs we see by analyzing each of the provided choices, only the first 2 choices are not possible as they don\u2019t correspond to multiplying 8 by any number equal to or larger than 2.\nSo we can eliminate choices A and B.\n\nIf we were to choose either A or B, it wouldn\u2019t be effective at memorizing the other multiplying facts as it would only work for each particular number once.\n\nFor choice C, since it is asking about the last figure of 8, we know that it can\u2019t relate to 13 or any other number of the scale except 12 which would just repeat itself and have no new information.\n\nFinally, choice A: Add8 would be what would help rememember 8x11 or 13 since the last figure of 11 is 1 or the last figure of 30 is 0.\nHowever, this answer would not help with the", "answer": " 54"}

Since Alison only picked small tubs, the only choice that fits is for her to buy 6 for $2 each, with the total cost of $48.\n2. The next important piece of information is that she has five tubs total in the storage system, comprising of three large tubs and two small tubs. This means the total cost for all five tubs is $48.\n3. When we look at question #2, we know she's bought three large tubs for $6, for a total of $18. Her two small tubs are worth $2 each, for a total of twelve dollars with an additional six dollars for the two large tubs. So altogether she has spent seventy-eight dollars.\n4. If the cost of a large tub is $6, then the cost of a small tub is $2. This means she would have spent sixty-six dollars on the large tubs alone.\n5. Question #3: The total cost is $48 for five tubs. This means you divide $48 by 5 to get a total of $9.\n\n### Answer:The total tub cost is $48, which means that three large tubs", "answer": " 5"}

We've narrowed it down to the second choice C \"150 minutes\". This is the second option from the bottom. \n\n### Explanation:\nC: \"150 minutes\": C: \"150\" and not \"150 minutes\" is the most likely to be the solution. \nC: \"166.67\" is not the solution for the following reasons:\n\nThis choice is incorrect because the answer is an integer. A number that can be divided into units without a remainder; 150 is an example of an integer.\nThe word \"minutes\", when used in the question, indicates an amount of time.  \nAn integer or whole number is a number consisting solely of 0s, 1s and so \non, without a decimal point or fractional part. 150, for example, is a whole \nnumber because it cannot be broken down into a fraction.\nTherefore, this answer is not the solution. \n \n### Question:\nWhen solving the equation x= a\u22c5b, what do the variable \"x\" and the \nexponents \"a\" and \"b\" represent?\n\n### Demoratation:\nWhen solving the above equation, the variable \"x\" represents the multiplicand (also known as the product). The exponent \"a\" represents the multiplier and the exponent \"b\" represents the dividend (also known as the quotient).\n\n### Exaplanation:\nLet's start with variable \"x\" because x = (a\u22c5b) implies x is the product (multiplicand) of a and b. \n\nTo understand the exponent \"a\" first, we have to define the terms multiplier and dividend.\nMultiplier means the size of the multiplicand. For the above example, \"a\" would be the size or value of the multiplicand, \"a\u22c5b\" which essentially tells us that we take a and b and multiply the result by a.\n\nThe dividend, on the other", "answer": " 75"}

When taking into consideration the number of boats as well as the dimensions for each boat, there are only 5 options.\n\n\n**C** is incorrect because a lane in a river cannot have 6 boats on it; to maintain the two-foot distance from the bank and the side of other boats, three-lane lane should only be able to take 4 boats. Likewise, **D** cannot be true as there are two lanes, which means 3 boats can be in each lane. Then at least two additional boats will collide with each passing boat at least twice, causing further damage and collision that will increase the number of broken boats.\n\n**A** is incorrect because every boat would not require an equal amount of space to pass.

One way to ensure the safety of others is to restrict drivers who are transporting large numbers of people on the street. This ensures there will be enough space for emergency service vehicles.\n\n### Answer: Passenger\n\n### Example:\n```\nCars carrying more than 5 passengers are prohibited from the streets.\n```\n\n### Response 2:\n```\nCats that weigh over 10 kilograms are prohibited from entering cat-friendly stores.\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe word \"that\" indicates a comparison between two nouns so we know the adjective needs to apply to the cats entering the store.\nThe only qualifier to \"that\" is \"cat-friendly stores,\" which implies the cats cannot enter because it is not cat-friendly. This means we know it is not friendly to cats.\nExplanation of Adjective\nCat-friendly describes a store so by using the adjective \"that\" as a qualifier, \"cat-friendly is a requirement for entering your store.

For example, how do 12/8 and 9/4 relate to each other.  First, note that 12 is 2 away from 10, which I can solve by adding 2 to 10 or taking the whole 10 away.  So, 9/4 = 5/2.  Next, how does 5/2 relate back to 12/8?  If 12 is 1 3 2 3 2 away from 8, the next 3 will be 3 2 1.  Since one has 2 and one 3, I can eliminate the 2 and add 5.  So, 5/2 must equal 1.  I will proceed by adding 2 1 3 to 2 3 3 2, then take away the whole 8, which equals 1.

There are 4 quarters in a gallon. Each bottle of Champagne is about 3 5/8 quarts. So each gallon of Champagne is 1 2/7 and 7/15 of a gallon.\nThis means A is not the answer because there needs to be about 40 gallons to fill the tub. \n\nB: The request is to how much champagne is required to 100% fill a 40 gal hot tub. There are four gallons in a bottle of champange. Each bottle contains five cubic feet, and a hot tub measures 160 inches by 58 inches and six inches deep.\nA gallon of champagne is the same as a bottle.

The first question is to determine how many dimes. The number of dimes can be found by finding the difference of 329 and the quarter amount.\n2. The second question is to determine how may quaters. The answer appears to be dimes since they are multiplied by 10. Because the quaters have been divided by ten, and we subtract the number from the previous 10 to obtain the number of dimes.

It can also show the null hypothesis is not supported.\n\n### Rationale\nAll subjects must have the control food for a certain period of time or must be fed with the same sort of food during the experiment.\nBoth approaches would be unrealistic, since human eating habits and diets differ and may not be altered to such an extent.

{"text": "Mark owes $553\n\n### Rationale:\nThis is a question posed to an audience, where the audience are provided the context. There are multiple elements comprising the context. Here the speeding ticket is an item described, and the final outlay is known, that is $553. \nHowever, there are multiple elements of the penalty that must be answered, because the audience is not given an obvious and consistent mechanism for each element of the fine to determine the amount Mark must pay.\n\nTo solve this for Mark's penalty, an answer must use a mechanism. In this case the mechanism involves multiplying the number of points and applying the scale. For instance, the base fine of $75 x 1.4 = $105, where the multiplier is 1.4 and the base is $75. Similarly, the extra cost of being in a school zone adds $200 x 2 = 400. The extra factor of being in a school adds four times the base speeding fine, and 4 x $50 = $200. This adds up to the total sum of 75 + 200 + 400 = 675. This is the total penalty. \nUsing the multiplier mechanism means multiplying by the multiplying factor of 4 x 1.4 and this gives 553.\n\nIf another mechanism were present, such as an element is added at a certain point and so on, the answer would be the sum for all penalties at that point. Here the final amount to pay $553 is the sum of all components applied.\n\nHowever, a second mechanism, wherein the answer is the number that results when the multiplier is subtracted and then the multiplier element is added, would yield $70. Here the answer is the sum of $375, the element of $300 and $75. So $375, $300 and 75 are the three elements of the solution.\n\nThe third option for a mechanism could be to apply a multiplier at the start of an element or penality. So, the resultant amount would be $207, using the same multiplier, but at $200, rather than at the end of the $300. In this case, the answer would have been", "answer": " 820"}

A scenario in which Fred spent half of his allowances (6 dollars) in movie tickets and he earned six dollars when he washed the car. \n2. The second part states that Fred earned 14 dollars and wants us to find his weekly allowance.\n### Demonstiration\n1. Fred\u2019s weekly allowance can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst of all, let's represent Fred\u2019s allowance as \"A\" :\n```\n6/2 = 0.3 A\n14 - A = 14 - (0.3 A)\n$ (14 - A) * 0.3 = 0.42 A\n0.42 A = 14 \nA = 14 \u00f7 0.42 = 32.3358\n```\nThe second way of calculating Fred\u2019s weekly  allowance is to deducted the amount of money Fred spend in one week on movies :\n```\n6 A + 2 = 28. \n```\n\n2. The problem could be solved as follows :\n\n```bash\nA = 28 \u00f7 ( 6 + 2 )\n```\nAfter a little bit of calculation, the equation could be written as:\n```bash\nA / (6 + 2) \u2248 28\n\n2 A \u2248 28 (A \u2248 14)\n\nA \u2248 1333.6 (A \u2248 3.2)\n\nA \u00f7 2 \u2248 1.66 (A \u2248.6)\n\nA \u00b1 0.33 \u2248 1.3\n\n```\nNow, if you divide A by 0.33 you will get 38,96, which is close to 40. So that A must be very close to 40, that means the allowance would be 40 or 45 dollars per week.", "answer": " 16"}

Choices: 1A: Intelligent people B: People full of ambition and energy C: People with positive attitudes D: People with strong beliefs E: People who are persistent\nRationales: One can conclude that the most likely candidate of success is a person with strong beliefs because their belief will keep them persistent even when they are faced with various challenges.  A person with strong belief will not have doubts about their work and that is why they are likely to be the most persistent.

{"text": "To solve this problem, we need to do two steps of subtraction. So $25 represents the original amount in the piggy bank. After spending half of the amount, $12.50 and $12.5, the amount in her piggybank became equal to $8.5. Next, divide this amount by half, the amount is $4.25. Now, half of the $50 amount is $25.5. The total number of steps is 6. And the amount that we needed to subtract in both steps is $25.\n\n### Rationale:There is nothing inherent about the question or its context that forces one specific method of solving the problem. There are various approaches that work. One can subtract all the money from the beginning to get the final amount. This however, requires one additional step. One can find the fraction of money that is left. This requires two additional steps. Finally, given the context of this question, it is simple to find the original amount. As the student only kept half in the bank and spent the first half, it stands to reason the original amount was more than half of $51.

{"text": "According to a math problem, Angelina is 4 years ahead of Justin and will be 40 when she is 5 years older. This means that Justin's age when he is 5 years older than his age now is 40. Hence, Justin\u2019s age equals 40 \u2013 4 = 36 years.\n\n### Rationale: 1. To calculate the age of Justin, we must first know his age now, which is given as 12. Then, we can subtract 4 from it to get 12\u20134 = 8. From here, we can subtract 8 from 5 to get 4\u20138\u20134 = -2. So, 40\u20134 = -2 and then subtract 8 from this, giving -2\u20138=-10. Lastly, subtract 12 from 10\u201310 = -12. Add the result to get -12+12 = 0. Therefore, Justin\u2019s age = 0 (0 years).\n\n### Example:\n\n### Instruct question:What will happen if you are exposed to a strong magnetic field?\n\n### Demostration: \nWe must first figure out what a strong magnetic field is. From the context, it would imply that it is a magnetic field with a stronger magnetic pole strength than our normal environment. We can use this understanding to answer the question. According to Faraday\u2019s Law of electromagnetic induction, electric currents will be induced in closed loops of wires in the presence of a magnetic field, as illustrated in Figure 1. The induced electrical current has a positive relationship with the strength of the magnetic field in the closed loop.\nIf one was to expose themselves to a strong magnetic field, then the induced electrical current will increase. This happens because as magnetic fields strength increases, the closed loop wires also experience more current. In other words, this phenomenon can be described as \u2018the relationship between induced current strength and the strength of a closed circuit magnetic field\u2019.\n\nFigure 1\n[Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_electromagnetic_induction)\n### Answer:\nBecause strong magnetic fields will induce more electrical current flowing through a loop, an individual may experience an electric shock or a se", "answer": " 31"}

Therefore, they sell veggies, and a veggie store is called a \"Farmers' market.\" This means the store is a Farmers' market since they deal in fresh vegetables and each customers who go to the market can buy 2 heads of lettuces for $ 1 each = $ 2 \u00d7 200 = $400, and they also can purchase 4 tomatoes for $.05 apiece =, and $ 4 \u00d7 2000 =$ 8000, therefore, the total sales of lettuce & tomato store for the month is $ 400 + $ 8000 =$8400.\n\nStep2: To get the amount of money, the store would receive in sales of lettuces and tomato, we need to convert the total sales of lettuces & tomato into cash. For this, we need to multiple the product by its selling price. To convert the product into dollars, first we need to multiply the lettuce with $ 1 and 4 tomatoes at $.05 a piece as, \n1 \u00d7 200,\n4 \u00d7 0.5,\n\nStep3: Multiplying $ 1 with 200, we get 200 \u00d7 $ 1 =$200 and similarly, we can proceed for 4 tomatoes as,4 \u00d7 $ 0.5 =$ 2, therefore, the total sale of lettuce & tomatoes for the month is $200 0.04 =$200. \n\n\nStep4: Now, if we want to know, how much money, in dollar, the store will receive in sales of lettuale and tomato per month for 500 customers, we need to understand what the given information indicates.

The sentence states, \"the height of a computer screen is 20 cm longer than the perimeter of a square shaped piece of paper\".\n2. The perimeter of a square is equal to 4 sides multiplied together, so the perimeter of that piece of paper is 10\u00d74cm=40cm. This means if the height is 20cm longer than the perimeter then the height is 40cm+20=60cm.\n3. Next, we convert that into cm using the given units. 60cm x 1cm/1m=60m then 60m/10=6m.\n4. This means the perimeter of that square shape 10/2cm=5cm. The screen height is 5cm+20cm=25cm.\n5. Because the screen and paper shapes have the same height, their perimeter must be the same, so: 5cm/\u03c0\u224825cm/\u03c0 so 25cm/\u03c0\u22485cm/\u03c0 which is the same as 25/5\u22485.\n6.

Because the problem is asking how many customers are served in total by Ann, Becky and Julia, we can start by considering Ann's output.\n\n**Step 4.** Method2: We can first determine the amount of time Ann is able to work and then consider the number of customers she can serve within that time frame.\n\n**Step4 1.** If Ann, Becky and Juila are working for 8 hours each day on average, the time Ann works for 7 hours is her output.\n\nStep4 2. Given that she is serving 7 customers per hour, she is serving 49 customers each day.\n\n**Step5.** We can sum the work of Ann and Julia together and we reach a result of 140.\n\nNow let's find out how many customers Becky served in total because we can use the same method with them.\n\n**Step1.** Method 1: The work of Becky can be determined by considering  how long she is working for and how many customers she serves each hour.\n\nStep2.

{"text": "Rick has 8 sisters and 5 friends.\n\n### Input and Output: In order to get the answer, we will have to find the total number of cards to have 15 and 5 cards left as well. The first step is finding the remaining number after taking away the number of cards. We know that Rick decides to give 15 cards to Miguel so after taking away that number to 130 cards, there are 130 - 15 = 115 cards. He then distributes 8 to his friends and 12 to each sister so we can write the remaining number of cards as 12 + 8 = 20. Finally Rick distributes 3 cards to each of his sisters so he has to get rid of 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 16 cards. Therefore, we can write 20 - 16 = 4 and the total number of cards that Rick gave to Miguel is 115 + 15 = 215. Now since Miguel only requested 15 cards so he must have gotten at least 15 so the total number of cards given to Miguel is 215 + 16 = 231.\n\n### Answer: \n- Rick has 130 and 5 friends\n- He has 8 sisters\n\n### Input And Output to Answer: In order to get to the answer for how many cards are left, I simply subtracted his original 130 and subtract 15 cards that he gave to Miguel in total, which made 115 cards left.

Based on the given fact below, x cannot be more than 40 or higher.\n   - \"40% of his (number of students who got grade b and above) got a final grade below b.\"\n\n### Followup:With 60 students in grade 5, what is the total number of students who are above b?\n2. Since the percentage used is 40%, let x = number of students above 40.\n3. It is obvious that x cannot be 40 because 40+40 = 80\n4. x can be anything and any number greater than 40 because not all 60 students are grade ab and below.\n\n### Follow up: x = 20\n5. Based on the number above, x = 20, and the total number of students is\n\n$$x + (60-x) = 20 + (60 - 20) = 60$$\n\n$$60 = 80$$\n\n$$20 = 80/5$$\n\n$$2 (x) = 16$$\n\nFinally\n\n$$16 = x$$\n\n### End:Conclude the response after determining all the steps necessary to solve the question.\n### Rationale\n1.

We could easily answer the question if we knew how John could convert the cow's weight into pounds, multiply the weight by a factor of 1.5, and multiply by the price of the cow.\n2. To calculate the cow's original weight, multiply its units of measurement by the number 4. In this case, a cow weighs 1000 kg and therefore 1000 * 4 = 4000 lbs.\n3. Multiply the original weight of the cow by 1.5 to find its new weight.\n4. To determine how much the increased weight boosted the worth of the cow, multiply its new weight by the price per pound ($3).\n\n### Input:-4 > 1\n### Output:True\n\n### Justification:We can test whether 4 is greater than or equal to -1 as follows. Subtract -4 from -1 and the difference equals -5 which is greater than -4.

Choices: \n\nA: the wall was dangerous and Humpty was warned not to sit on it. B: Humpty could have been helped if someone had warned him about the wall. C: the wall wasn't high enough for Humpty to fall off. D: Humpty had no fear of heights.E: Humpty chose to ignore the danger of sitting on the wall.\nRationales: The question is asking about a specific use or meaning of the word \"irony\" in a certain sentence.\n\n1. Let's look at the sentence and note that the main subject is Humpty Dumpty who sits on the edge of a wall, so option A could be the subject.\n2. But we can eliminate this choice because the implied meaning is about Humpty's fall and not the wall height.\n3. So, let's move on to B. Option B could be a literal explanation for the given sentence, but the statement is not about the high or dangerous wall, so the answer is incorrect.\n4. Choices C, D, E are all plausible interpretations for the sentence, but we can determine that option C is more plausible because it aligns better with the context (Humpty falls off the wall).\n5. Option E seems to be a counterargument to the previous choice which is implied since Humpty is not warned about the wall height.\n6. Thus, the answer would be E: Humpty chose to sit on the edge of the high wall.\n7. An alternate valid answer would be C: the wall wasn\u2019t tall enough to warrant his care. Both options provide equally correct meanings for this sentence.\n8. If one of the questions is asking about irony in general or the common usage of the word, then the correct answer would be B: Humpty could be warned and helped if he chose to, but he doesn't.\n\n\n**The example can also illustrate how the response can be provided in multiple ways.** \n\n### Input- 1.

This is evidence that the previous group of students who raised their hand were probably those we are more concerned about.\n4. They may have said what we expect to hear - yes we slept well. \n5.

We can get a better understanding of the answer by looking at the given clue in bold which is, \"When the professor noticed...\".\n8.

To get the total number of unused crayons you first add all the odd unused crayons (in the 2 boxes). Then, subtract the even unused crayons in the other two boxes.

The first 11 beakers will have copper ion because there are in total 14 drops and 11 drop beakers and the last drop will have copper ion in it because there is 8 beaker with 8 drop each, and there is 45 drop beakers, so 45-8=37 and there is 8 beakers with 8 drop in total, so 37-8=29 the last two beaker will remain without copper ion. The last remaining 11 beakers are used to find copper ion in them, and 11 beakers contain copper ions.\n\n**Hint:**\nTo find the number of beakers without copper ion, subtract the number of beakers that contains copper ion (8 beakers). This is because the beakers that contain copper ion would not turn blue (since the liquid in beakers that contains cooper ion would turn blue, the 3rd drop should make it turn blue.).

According to the passage, the seats are arranged in 2 groups of 4 seats each. Therefore, the bus has 8 groups of 4 seats. If we count all the empty seats we can deduce how many people are riding on the bus. In each row of 4 seats we can see 2 seats are occupied, which means there are 8 occupied seats (16 people) in each group. For the second row, all 3 seats are empty because there are only 13 people on board. Therefore, our answer should be 0.\nBy adding the second row value to the first, the empty seats are now 13, then we have to add the seats occupied in the second and third groups of 4 seats, which equals 16. That gives us an unoccupied number of 34 seats.

This refers to the social classes in society that are divided based on how much money they have and how much money is generally earned by people in their class. For example, if someone has very little money and someone else has a lot, it means there is a big difference between their wealth and income. This is seen when one person may only have just enough to buy their necessities whereas another person can afford to buy a luxury car and live in a well-appointed mansion. This inequality leads to inequalities in education, health care, housing, and other essential amenities of life. It also contributes to poverty, crime, and other major problems throughout society.\n\nNow, let's look at air pollution problems. Air pollution is a serious problem faced by many developing countries. It causes deaths by causing respiratory diseases and it also damages the environment and other people's health. For example, if pollutants are allowed to enter a water source, they will create hazardous conditions in the water and also contaminate the soil. This will potentially lead to food contamination and spread of diseases. Therefore, the government is unable to help because this would need a lot of funding and resources as well as more manpower. \n\nLast, there are diseases and illnesses that need immediate medical attention and cannot be solved through medications or other methods of healing. There are also problems that are out of control because they are caused by factors which are not human-caused, such as natural disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes which cause dev", "answer": " 5"}

Your friend might reply, \"I don't know,\" and ask you what three means and what divided by means, in turn. While you could help your friend by explaining what \"thirds\" is and what \"quotient\" means, the situation might call for something more elaborate. Maybe there is a group of two or three students in the class who did not go to that lesson of the day. After explaining to those individuals that \"thirtieths\" means \"thirties\" or \"parts of thirties,\" and \"quotient\" means \"the answer,\" you could ask them to use those \"new\" terms to calculate a fraction. You may also ask them to explain why the fraction 1/4 is the same as thirtieths in a set of thirties or to give an example of a number divided by thirtieths. After you have asked them how they would get a solution, ask whether they would apply that information to the solution of similar examples that could be considered \"math problems.\" It seems that many people in education today are more interested in how well a person understands the methods and rules of solving math problems rather than on how well one can apply the knowledge and use it for problem-solving in actual life situations.\n\n### Response\nWhile your friend was able to obtain numbers following the instructions, the way she received them may seem odd to you. She did not give much thought to the given phrase. In other words, she did not do enough thinking to derive the solution or the outcome. You might have thought of a better method that was less confusing and would enable your friend to grasp the idea of finding thirtieths when the question was to find a fraction.

{"text": "The solution to this problem can be found by analyzing the equation, which states that, the total amount of money that Lilith will need to buy her friend the gift = The regular price of a water bottle + the discount from the sale price. Substituting the given values in the equation, we get the following: regular price of a waterbottle + discount from the sale= 185+(1-2-1.85) = 182.7.\nNotice from the previous calculation, there is a 0.25 difference from the cost of a water bottle, and  that gives us around 0.25cents.

{"text": "It costs $940 to buy a table and four chairs.\n\n### Rationale: 1. The first expression says that the cost of a chair is 1/7 of that of a table. If the cost of a table is $140, each chair can be expressed as $140/7 = $20.\n2. The second expression states that chairs cost $20, so the cost of a chair x 4 would be $20 x 4 $80.\n3. Adding these two, the total cost of buying a table and four chains is $140 + $80 = $220 + $4 x $80 = $940.\n4. The answer is therefore $940 because for all the chairs and table combined it would cost that much.\nInput: If you wanted to make a chicken salad, how would you mix the ingredients?

The question is whether the ingredients used to prepare a chicken salad should be mixed together in a blender or chopped up manually for example.\n2. All of the given choices are incorrect and therefore the right one is the answer.\n3. Answer E: dice - dice is the right answer because of the following reasons: 1. It is not necessary to blend in order to prepare a chicken and the dice option is the right answer.\n4. Considering the context, the dice answer is the right answer because it is not stated that the food has to be chopped up with a sharp object in order to be prepared.\n5. Answers A: melt, B: dice and C: shave indicate foods that have been cut with a sharp object.\n6. Answer D: dice represents cutting with a blunt object and the context does not necessitate the usage of either a bladed or blunted object  to prepare this food.\n7. Furthermore, the dice answer is relevant because in the given context the food is being prepared and ingredients are mixed together manually.\n8.

{"text": "$3.  Answer: Option A\n\n### Demolition:  One can determine from these details that Mary spent $50 on sunglasses and $50 on jeans and that Rose spent  $150 on shoes and $20 on a pair of basketball cards. It stands out clearly from the text that in each item of clothing and shoes, Mary has bought two pairs while Rose has bought only one (pair). Combining this with the dollar amounts of items purchased by both Mary and Rose reveals the shopping expenses to look like this:  60(pair of jeans),  60(2 pairs of sunglass),  50(pair of sunglass),  $150(shoes) and  20(pair of basketball cards). \n\nThe total expense is  $400 by Mary and  $230 by Rose. Subtracting the former from the later gives the value of Rose's purchase of one basket ball card which is $130. Thus, one deck of basketball cards is worth   $130.\n\n### Response", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "It is not specified which flashlight is which, but since Veronica can see Freddie's flash-light at night, then he can see Veronica's flash-light. That means that Veronica and Velma are on opposite sides of Freddie and so Velma is 2km and Veronica is 3 km from Freddie. Freddie is half way between them. That means that Velma is seeing Veronica from a greater distance - 2 km. That means that Veronicas flashlight is at 1000-2=998 feet. Therefore, Velma can see Veronica' at a distance 6km from Freddie or a distance 5 X 6=5x6km-50km. In one km there are 1600 feet and in 5 x 6 km=30000 feet.

I chose Answer A because the question is asking us to answer the flight duration from New York and Cape Town. It's a good idea to note that the question has a lot of context so we should answer it using an equation.\n2. Since Chance arrived in New York at 6AM Monday, we can find the number of hours the flight has taken by subtracting the hours it took him to get from New York to Cape City, divided by the hours from London to New York. However, the question implies that Chance is currently in cace town.\n3. So we can figure out the number of hours it will take a flight from New York to cecas town, by subtracting from 18 which is 18- the number of hours Chance took from New York to Cape city from 6AM Monday to 6AM Tuesday.\n\n### Rationales part 2\n1. We can see that Chance departed New York at 10AM Monday. So we have to subtract 18 hours from 10AM Monday which is 10AM-18 hours= 2PM Tuesday.\n2. Thereby, we subtract from 6AM Monday and we have 2PM, Tuesday.

{"text": "In steps:2, the author describes what Melanie will do once she tears each slice in half, \"tears those halves in half\". This is equivalent to the same as having torn each half-slice in half once too. Therefore, the sum of the total number of torn bread pieces is equal to 4.\n\nRationales:To begin, the author describes Melanie's initial action as tearing the bread slices \"2 slices of bread to smaller pieces\".\n\nThis suggests an approach where we can sum the total amount of torn bread pieces by beginning with the main ingredient (bread slices) and then dividing it into smaller pieces (tearing each bread slice in half/twice).

If the rationales are lengthy, please use bullet points to structure the information and ensure it remains understandable.\n\n### Rationales :\n\n*  **Rationale #1**: The number of oranges in the total (180) can be considered halfway between the higher number (80, which Emily sold) and lower number (90, which Alice sold). Therefore, the possible integer values of the number of oranges sold by Alice could be 80, 81, 82, \u2026, 90. However, 81 is one more than halfway between the total (181) and half of the higher number (81, which Emily sold). Therefore, Alice sold 90 oranges.\n\n*  **NOT a Rationale #1**:  If we round the total (18i in our problem) to the nearest int value (18 i or 18 i), the value (18 i) would be considered halfway between Alice\u2019s (90) and Emily\u2019s high number (81, i.e. Emily\u2019s 81 or 81).\n\n*  **Not an answer choice**: Using the number values 1 - 90, you can form the equation n=1+a+b+c+ (...)+ z, where a+b+c+... = 181 and n = 1 + 90 = 91.\n\n*  Rationale #1: The above calculation assumes that half of Alice\u2019s total sales is half the higher total number (181 in the above problem), even though 181 =", "answer": " 120"}

Choices: A: 10 pounds B: 20 pounds C: 30 pounds D: 50 pounds E: 60 pounds\nRationales:\n1. Water has a density of 1 gram per mL.\n2. The volume of a liter is 1,000 mL.\n3. So, the weight of 1 liter of water is 1,010 grams. \n4. By the same logic, the weight of 3 liters is 3,110 grams.\n5. Let's take a look at all the choices and determine their accuracy to the given question.\n6. Choices A, B, and C - are all greater than 1,011 grams.  Since the provided question asks about the weight of \"a large amount of water\", these answers are not acceptable.\n7. Choices D and E are less than the correct answer value.  It is likely that what the question is asking for is a large quantity, even if we're not explicitly instructed.\n8. Choices D and F are between 1,013 and 1,623.  This is a large quantity of water.\n9. According to the values of the given options, the correct answer is E.\n10.

Avoiding cutting down more trees in rainforests can help them survive; however, what is being asked is what can someone do to save the rainforest, not how to make it less damaged.\n6.

We begin by identifying the quantities in the pallets.\n3. half is 10\n4. a quarter is 5\n5. a fifth is 2\n6. the total or summation we get is 17\n7. From the question, we require the remaining quantity of paper cups in the pallets. We subtract the total quantity from the required quantity.\n8. 17 - 504 => 504 - 17\n9. The result is 487\n10. To make it easy, round down to 487 - 200 => 287\n11. 287 is not divisible by 20, so the leftover is 2.\n12. We are required for the number of pallets.\n13. Subtract the remainder 2 from 504 to get 492\n14. Since 20 is divisible by 4, there is sufficient quantity of paper cups remaining, therefore it is equal to 492/4 = 123 pallets\n15. Subtract 100 to get the number of paper cups. We'll use remainder once again\n16. 123 - 100 => 123 -12\n17. The remainder is 1 and when we round down, 2 is 2 pallets. This is why the number of pallets is 523.\nAnswer: 523 pallets.\n\n### Input:: The bakeries and grocery storess were in competition with one another.

{"text": "The class consists of 20 students, half of them play basketball, two fifths play volleyball, and one tenth play both. This leaves five students not playing either game.\n\n### Rationale:\nLooking at the problem statement, we can start with identifying the variables, which includes the class, the number of students, and the number of students who play either basketball or volleyball.\n\nLet _x_ be the number of students who are not playing basketball or volleyball and _b_ be the number of people who are playing basketball. The question asks us to calculate _x_. However, we already know that half of the students play basketball, which is equal to _b = 10_.\n\nWe also know that two fifths of the students play volleyball, equaling 20 - 10 = 10. This means that we have a total of 20 students who are playing basketball and volleyball, or 20% of the total class.\n\nNext, we can subtract the total amount of students playing both basketball and volley from the total amount of students who play either game, which equals 10 - 2 = 8.\n\nFurthermore, we can subtract 5 from this number. This means that a total of 5 students don't play either basketball or vol-leyball, or simply 5% of the total class of 20 students.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: There are 535 students in the class. 275 of them play volleyball while their remaining 260 are playing basketball.

Considering the options A-E, A stands for the book, B is the database, C is the dictionary, D is the library and E is the encyclopedia.\n3. From the context of the question, we know that our target information source should have a significant understanding of the topic under discussion. Therefore, we can immediately eliminate C and D, respectively, the dictionary and library, because they have relatively small coverage of subject matters.\n4. Moving to the remaining sources, A stands for a textbook which is usually authored by experienced experts in the field of study. As such, we eliminate D, the encyclopedia, because it is an information source that doesn't necessarily represent or cover a broader range of topics.\n5. To figure out the best alternative to choose, we evaluate E, which is the expert; an expert is someone who possesses extensive knowledge in their particular field", "answer": " 72"}

Which of the following activities will be crucial to meeting this pledge? Choices: 0: no one A: coaching B: communication skills C: athletics D: team building E: discipline\nRationales:1. The question is asked to decide which of the five activities/skills is most important to winning a state championship.\n2. We can eliminate options 0, A, E, and B because they are not necessary for winning a state championship. Additionally, if coaching is necessary, there should be at least another relevant option, such as a skill (option C) or discipline (option D).\n3. The remaining options are C, D and C. Discipline seems unlikely to be the most important skill for winning a state championship as it might not be as important as good coaching and communication.\n4. Option D, team building, seems to be an important skill because it can help build a strong and cohesive team, which is essential for winning a state championship in team sports.\n5.

In this calculation, $40 is the given price that each concert ticket costs.\n2. The number of tickets bought are 12 and this means that $48 is subtracted from the original price which leaves it as $40, which is the given price of each concert ticket.\n3. With a given percentage of discount, that is, each additional ticket acquired after the ten is discounted by 5 percent, resulting in a discount of 5 percent after each ticket attained after the ten.\n4. With this, then the discounted price of an additional ticket after the given ten is $0.95(0.05) x $40, which would be subtracted from the original ticket price.\n5. Therefore, to this calculation, the total price of 1 or two concert tickets is $40 then to the remaining number of tickets purchased, the discounts of 5 percent would be deducted until the number of additional tickets attained is a multiple of ten of an additional ticket.\n6. To attain 12 concert tickets, to $40, then $155 would be deducted from the total price as the discounted price, leaving $24.50.\n7.

{"text": "Sally and Bob have 365 days to earn the money for their trip, so in order to understand how much they've earned by the end of the year, 365 days later, we must know how much they've each earned on a daily basis.\n\nAccording to our knowledge, Sally makes $6 every day in a year and Bob makes $4 every day in a year. This means that Sally earns $2 every day more than Bob.\nAs a result, from these two numbers, let's conclude that Sally has earned a total of $2x365= $730 in one year.\n\nIf we take a look at Bob, he has earned a total of 4x365=1460 in a year as well.\nSince Bob earns 4x360=1440 in a year, you can see that Sally's revenue is $1470.\n\nNow that we've got these two amounts, we are in a position to evaluate them.\n\nIf we subtract the number of money earned by Sally from Bob, we get $700-1460= -760.\nWe don't know if this is a negative, but if it is a negative, it's because they spent it in a year.\nWhen you subtract a negative number from 0, it will always result in a positive value, so there should be no concern about the direction of the new variable.\nTherefore, our new number, which we can call \"their revenue when babysitting over the year\" will be the negative -760.\n\nWe can now calculate the answer to our problem. We need to divide their revenue by the remaining value of the days in a year, 364.\nWhen we do this, we end up with $730-$760/364= -70/364 days, or - $0.02 per day for a year.\nTherefore, the answer to our problem is - $0.04 per day for a year\nAnswer: - $ 0.02 per Day \n\n### Demos:\nInput: What is the most accurate measurement unit for lightning?

He must also make enough stars to fill all the bottles he bought.\n3. We can now assume that each star can fit into 1 bottle.\n4. 15 of 1 bottle = 1/15 of one bottle is holding the star\n5. That is, 15 stars can hold in each bottle.\n6. The number of stars must be equal to 1 bottle. 1 bottle is 15 stars.\n7. So 2 bottles is 15 * 15 = 225\n8. And 3 bottles is 12 * 15 =180.\n9. Therefore 2 bottles(225) plus 3 bottles(180) = 405\n10. 405/15 = 27\n11. So 27 * 15 =375 and 375/1 =375.\n12. So total stars = 375 + 375 = 750\n13. That is the answer is 750", "answer": " 75"}

We know the gym close to his home is the gym he decides to get the membership to.\n  Gyms usually have a monthly sign-up fee in addition to the cost of the membership.

{"text": "Brian can now hold his breath for 81 seconds.\n### Rationale:  He started out holding his breath for 10 sec, then he doubled it every week, so after 1 week, it would be 20 sec, after 2 weeks, 40 sec, then 80 sec.  Then, it doubles again to 160 sec, then 320 sec, then 640 sec.  This shows that he added 110 to his original number every week.  Now, 640 + 110 = 750 sec.  So, we take our answers from the previous week: 160 + 70 = 230.  So, the final answer for Brian's maximum breath holding time would be 230 + 112 = 342 or 81 sec. 81\n### Input:  In the video clip, how many times can the person lift the rock before they fail?\n\n### Instructions:\nCheck all that apply.\n\n### Inputs:\nThe person lifts the rock  howeve many times it is\n\n### Demostrations:(video links)\n1) [Link 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-_hZQBM281OgT-b_MZH922Y41K0-_lB/view) 2) [Link2](https://drive.googlegoogle.com/drive/folders/1OjYC180D1ZXy5CsJU4yW06YsOyB-HjD)\n\n### Input:(How many students are in your class)?\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/GzXLwZH.png)", "answer": " 60"}

Alice had an epiphany and became an artist. George was not a good driver. If we knew that Alice and George were in the same car accident, then how could we know that George was not the driver of the car?\"\n\n### Response:\"George is the driver of the car\"\n\nTo answer how we know that George is the driver of the accident, we can say that Alice had an epiphanic moment but George was the driver due to the implication that \"If we knew that Alice and george were in the same car crash then we can tell that George is a horrible driver\". This is also further substantiated by the statement that \"Alice was an artist.\" This also helps us to know that George is not the driver. The conclusion that George is the driver can be supported by considering the word \"if\" in the sentence. The statement \"If we knew that George was not the one who was driving then we could determine that George was indeed the one who crashed the car.\" So in short we can say that George crashed the car and he is not the one who was the driver which also means he is a horrible driver. George is the driver because he crashed the car and Alice was an artist, proving that George is a horrendous driver.\n\n---\n[Source](https://www.quora.com/Is-this-a-correct-answer-For-the-Math-question)", "answer": " 45"}

Each grapefruit half has 12 sections, which slice into segments. Each orange is sliced into 14 sections, including the peel.

Every half of the orange has one section, and there are 16 sections in total.\n\nOn the other hand, the battleground has half-grapefruit, with each section having 12 pieces.

The school made $48.50 in profit.\n\n### Solution 1\nThis solution follows the same format as the original question. It does provide some clarity in that it uses a numerical statement of the question, a numerical response, and a reasonable interpretation of the question followed by a more mathematical interpretation of the question.\n```\n  A: $4.850 per eraser / 48.50\n  B: $4.800 per eraser / (24 erasers / box) / 48.00\n```\n### Solution 2\nThis solution is more straightforward. It provides two versions of the question and a straightforward solution.\n```\n   * 48 boxes @ $0.75 / box = 356.00 (answer)\n      OR\n   * 24 erasiers @ $0.70 per eraser = 170.00 + $150.00 (profit) = 32$0.00 (answer again)\n```\n\nNotice that the question does not specify a box. This causes some to assume a box in the answer and others a single erasier, leading to the $320.00 difference in the two solutions. The problem also leaves out the word \"for\", leaving many to believe that the cost is 75 cents per eraser.\n\n### Discussion\n\nThe problem in this question isn't the answer, but the way the question is written. There are several issues with the instructions. First, the question is about a student council and selling erasers \"before school starts\" to raise money for school dancers. However, the question does not indicate WHICH dances is referring to or which dances need the money or how much money is needed.

Choices:  F: 5050 B: 2025 D: 205 F: 2495\nRationales:1. The question's wording implies that the population question is relevant to all 5 states, which would be equal to the population of 500.\n2. In the given choices, only options A and F: 500 match the situation described in the question.\n3. Option D: 202,5 is an uncommon choice that is unlikely to be relevant to the question.\n4. Options B: 205 and F: 24,95 are also not relevant since they are not multiples of 500 and the question does not specify any multiple of 500 as the correct answer.\n\nOption F: 2455 is the most probable correct answer. The question implies that the population of 1 state is equal to 500, so assuming all 5 states are equal in population to a single state, the population of 5 States is equal to [multiplication of 500 (population of the single state)].

{"text": "The given prompt does not directly specify the relationship between tarantulas and baby tarantulas so it\u2019s best to provide context.\nEchoing out the sentence and simplifying, \"If A has B and B can contain 10C then how many B are in less than 5A?\"\n\nRationale:1. One of the ways to make sense of the question is to translate it into simpler terms. If one tarantula can have one baby, is the question asking how many baby legs are in one less than 1,500,000?\n2. Another way is to consider the context by imagining what one egg sac could be used for. A tarantula egg sac could be an egg in a nest. Or an egg and a couple of tarantulas.\n3. Let\u2019s simplify it one step more. Baby tarantulas are babies of baby tarantulas -  in one tarantula egg there must be 3 or so babies like the baby of the grandchild of a baby; in a nest of 50 eggs there must be 5 or so babies in one nest of 50; so one less than 5 is like one babies left after 1000.\n4.

{"text": "Answer:25, \nRationales:1. First we must count the number of mated couples because the statement clearly states that there is a 25% chance of pregnancy. So out of the 16 panda's, in a given birth, there will be a 100% times 25% chance that 1 couple will get pregnant.\n2. Because of the 25% chance, there will be 14 other couples.\n3. Out of this number we know that there will be 25% chance which is times 25% percent is 6% that will not get pregnant. So out of the other 14 couples, we take out the 6 couples that will not get preggers leaving us with 8.\n4. Now when we multiply this 8 times the 100% chance that will get pregnant that gives us 8 times 100% is 800% total.\n5. We then deduct that 800%, so 800%-25% which is 975%.\n6. Therefore, out of 16 pandas, 1 couple will produce 1 baby and the rest of the pandas will produce 975% of the babies which is 25 pandas.\n7. Thus, in total, 16 pandas will produce 14 babies in total, leaving 1 extra that is just for good luck, bringing the total to 15 pandas babies (16-1=15).\n###", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "I caught 35 pieces of candy\n\n### Demostration:\nAs Julie caught half the number of candies Tabitha caught, and there were 13 pieces of candy that Stan caught, the total candy that all three friends got would be half the candy that Tabitha caught plus the 13 pieces that Stan caught plus the number of candies that Julie caught. To solve this equation, the total candy each friend got would simply be the number of pieces of candy that Tabith's friend Julie caught (2x) then add those pieces to the number of pieces that Tabitha also caught (x). We will do this one by one, but let's just assume we have the sum.\n\n### Solution:We let X be the sum of all the pieces of candy that all friends except Julie caught. The total candy that all friends caught is equal to the sum of Julie's pieces plus X. Therefore, the total candy caught is X + (2*X) = 8X \nFinally, we simply plug in x (the sum of Tabitha's pieces and Julie's) into the equation to get X = x + (2x) = 4x. This means that the total number of pieces of cuddly Julie caught is 4X. \nFrom there, we simply plug that X into our original sum of 25 and we get 4X + 2X + 13 = 35.

Option A: The estimated number of people attending was 5,002 or higher and was definitely lower than the actual number, which means that the range of the estimated count is not valid.\n2. Option B: The same applies to option B, the range of estimation is not valid for people in the range of 5000 and 9999. However, \"B\" is closer to the actual number so it is possible that \"B\" is the larger range of the estimate.\n3. Option C: For this choice, although the estimated range is in the wrong direction than the actual count, their ranges are both bigger. In the end, the answer is that this estimate represents the largest range of the estimate because it is larger than both the actual and estimated counts.\n4. Option D: This estimate represents a wider range than the actual count.\n5. However, we can eliminate it because the estimate is definitely lower than the actual count and if we are asked about the estimate that represents a wider range, then this one can't be the answer.\n6.

It takes much more effort to understand a question if you don't break it down into smaller individual units, and in this case, we can easily identify what the question's units of measurement are.\n\n2. The first thing that should strike us about this question is that there are two units of measurement; 64 and 4.\n\n\n3. The main focus of the question relates to \"Joel\u2019s garden\", which we know is 64 square ft. But as you can see in the original question, some other units of measurements, namely \"fruit(1/4), section(25), 1/2\" seem also crucial to the question.\n\n\n4. The two variables in this question are the first and last units of measurements. The one in the middle is not relevant to the solution, so we will leave it out for now. \n\n\n5.

This leaves as possible choices - A or C.\n9. However the word \"femalies\" is not found in any of the dictionaries that were consulted during research. There are indeed instances where certain species lay eggs that are not fertillised. An example is shown in the diagram below.\n10. According to Wikipedia: In the case of birds, it is known that the eggs laid by certain species of seabirds (notably those of penguins and some of those of albatrosses) are generally not fertilised.\n11.

Explain your logic to the above in your answer.\n\n### Response\n- Suspension means that a person can't be in a position where they don't belong like a suspended ceiling\n- Ban means for people to not bring in anything, in this case it's knives with the ban.\n- To prevent people from bringing in knives into the building a ban was set up.\n- Ban keeps people safer in the in the building because with the ban they aren't allowed to bring weapons like knives so people will have to leave their weapons at home and they will be at less danger because there's nothing that they can possibly bring that could harm the people in the building.\n- The reasoning behind it is that it wouldn't be safe if people brought knives because it would be scary for any kid to walk in that building carrying a knife and that kid could use that knife if the kid ever wanted to. A ban means that it's only safe for those kids who don't bring knives into the building with the ban.\n\nAnswer:\n- Suspension: A suspension refers to a temporary removal of an individual from his or her position, typically as a result of disciplinary action\n- Ban: means forbidding, by legislation or prohibition a ban can refer to the removal of something from a government agency or organization\n- The ban prevents people from bringing knives since a ban is a restriction on something it's like a school has a ban on knives because if a kid does bring a knife and uses it then they will get in trouble\n- The ban keeps people safer which means the ban is effective since no", "answer": " 15"}

Choice A: The ratio between the genders cannot be 30:1 because there aren't enough females in the class. We only have 95 females with 55 males, so the ratio would be 1.59:1.\n2.

{"text": "The answer to this question is that Gerald needs to average 4.5 lawns per month. To reach this number, he will have to perform 45 lawns to reach the $100 target for each month that he is not playing baseball.\n### Detailed Response:\nTo figure out the answer to this question, we need to start by determining Gerald's monthly savings.\nWe know Gerald spends $1,000 on baseball supplies per year. If his season is 4 months, this means he must spend $250 on baseball supplies every month to complete a season.\nWe can then subtract $250 from $250 and divide the result by the number of months to determine Gerald's month income, which is $1,400.\nTo calculate what Gerald needs to earn every month to reach his savings goal, then, we multiply the amount by 4 to indicate the number of months in the season with no baseball activities.\nHowever, this answer to this question is a bit trickier than the rest because Gerald is saving the money in addition to his regular pay.\nTherefore, to reach Gerald's goal, he actually needs to earn $500 every month, which is the result of multiplying Gerald's month's income by 4.\nGerald spends a total of $100 every month on baseball supplies. If he wants to save up for his annual spending, then he will need to save nearly $1,700 over the course of four months. 4x1,700 is 6,800, which is then $640 more than Gerald is saving. We can then divide the remaining amount by 4 to determine the average amount Gerald needs to make per month: $1,709 / 4 = $426.\nTo complete Gerald's savings goal, then we only need to add a total of 45 lawn-like chores.  45x10 = $450, which is then the difference between $426 and $10.\n### Input:Ted's salon is opening a second location and they are looking for a new manager to run the new facility.

Based on these two pieces of information, we can figure out that the difference between the two months' average temperatures is 77-62=15 degrees Fahrenheit.\n3.Chosen Choices are: A: (77-62)= 15 B: (14)=14 \u00b0F C: -15\u00b0F D: -6\u00b0F E: -49\u00b0F\n4.We can eliminate choices: B, D, E because the question asks for the difference in degree between previous two months, not the previous two days.\n5.The Answer is : C: -15\n6.Example explanation:-62 is the average temperature during previous month\n7.77 is the average temperature during this month\n8.Therefore difference between the month's average in two months is (-62-77) = -15.\n### Input:\nA man was making a trip from the city to his sister\u2019s house in the country at 45 mph, and he was driving his car to make a stop over at the beach on the way and the total distance to his sister\u2019s home was 100 miles.

There are many different approaches to a word problem. However, when considering efficiency in time and in math operation there is one answer that can be used to complete the problem. If a person knows how to make change then the correct method to make sure that all the pennies, nickles, and dimes are accounted for while making the change, is to make more than enough coins.

{"text": "### Rationales:\n1. The cyclist plans to ride 12-mile, but since it's over a week, the distances he covers on each day will be different. For example, if Jerome travels 3 miles on the first day, he would probably cover 4 miles a day to make 12 miles total because traveling 4 miles in 2 days would not meet the goal for the day. \n2. Considering Day 2 to Day 15, it means Jerome will have 12 miles remaining on his trip. On the last day, he would probably cycle 12 miles to finish the trip.\n3. This will result in a total of 13 days.\n4. To check if the given answer of 12 days is correct, we need to calculate the number of miles on the remaining day.\n\nThis would be:\n\n- 2(distance covered on Day 1) + 2(distance covered Day2) + 4(distance covered Day 3) +... + (distance covered Day x) + 4(distancetracked on Day (x+1)) + 2(distance travelled on day (x+1)) = 13 \n\n\n5.

And as we know, the statement \"And the number of cars he was increase by 50%\" means every year he gains 50% more cars.\n4.

It is possible that he sold all 5 baked goods but sold them for $5 each since he wanted to make $50 instead of $39.\n\nIf he needed to sell more cookies, Jack would sell a larger number and charge a lower price per cookie.\n\n#### ChoicE:\nChoice E is the correct answer because it meets all criteria for the question. The response \"no baked goods\" is accurate because it represents the answer of \"no\". The \"baked goods\" component is included because it is required in order to raise the targeted $50. Finally, it is not possible to \"only eat no baked goods\", since one cannot \"eat\" a baked good.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct response of choice is E: \"no baked good.\"\n\n### Input\n\"The pizza that John ordered at the restaurant was more than twice the price of his ticket to the zoo.\"\n\n### Rationale\nThis question is designed to identify inaccurate reasoning, or logical fallacies, in the following statement.\n\nThe pizza that John has ordered from the restaurant is more expensive than his ticket to the zoo, therefore, John's ticket to the zoo is free\n\n### Response\nChoice B, The reasoning is not clear, is the correct answer to this question because it acknowledges that the initial reasoning does not follow, but does not specify how or why.\nThis is due to the lack of information about the value of things that may not be apparent from the given information.\nWe cannot compare apples and oranges without knowing their values.\nFor example, a single ticket to the zoo may cost $1", "answer": " 7"}

Therefore, the answer is 34 pounds.\n\n### Input\n\nThe answer to Tom's question is A: 34 pounds\n\n### Demostration:\nThe answer can be arrived at in the following ways.\n1. We can use the formula: 120% of 30 = 360 divided by 0.2 which equals 180\n2. We can multiply 3.0 (the weight of 30 pounds) times 1.2 (twenty percent) to get 3.6 and divide by 2 which is 1.8\n3.

To prepare, she read 6 books and took 8 online practice tests. She was more confident about her results after studying. The scores on the practice tests were close to her scores on the practice test but varied by some points. How many points did all of the practices scores vary by?\"\n\n### Response\nThis question contains four variables: tess scores, how many books, how many online practice tests, how much she studied, and points. There is only enough data to determine three of these four variables. We do not know how much she studied but we know the number of books and online practice tests. There are 6 books and 8 online practice tests which means that there are 14 total. The question mentions that she took practice tests and scored higher but lower on the practice tests than on the actual test but how much higher or lower is only mentioned in relation to scoring on a practice test. One point lower on the practice test is how much lower and she did not take more practice tests, just 8. To solve this question with all four variables there has to be a way to determine how she studied and the number of scores she got on every practice test. To do this we need a relationship variable with all 14 values combined. I have used the variable R to represent this relationship which is R=0.206 x 14. This means that the 14 values of R are 2.06. Now I will solve for tess scores using the new variable", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "Option E: 80cm\nInput: Why is it important not to talk when crossing a river with shallow waters? Choices: A: because it\u2019s dangerous B: to conserve breath C: to prevent drowning D: to cool oneself off E: so as not to make a sound\nRationales: Consider the context of the problem. Firstly we can see that there is an underlying dilemma; shallow water could make it difficult and dangerous to cross. Consequently, what is the most rational decision to reach the other side safely? There are two ways to address this. For one, talking can provide direction or guidance on avoiding obstacles, making it a way to remain calm and safe, which is exactly why it would be important to talk. The second would be silence, where the lack of speech might hinder the situation further. Based on this, D should remain the best answer. However, it is important to also analyze how a wrong answer would be different. According to the text, B is incorrect because no risk of drowning or getting stuck can occur if there was breath; however, A, B and C cannot be answered because they are not explicitly stated. Choice D is the only one of the choices that could possibly be the answer. However, that does not necessarily mean E is the correct answer. The text states that the reason to not talk is to remain calm and reach the other side safely. Therefore, the answer must relate to calm or safety. Based on this, A, B and D should be removed from consideration because they do not speak to calm or safety. What is left is E; however, this reasoning does not consider the question, \u201cIs it important not to make a sound?\u201d. E cannot be correct answer; not speaking at all would be a bad idea, so option B remains the best answer.\n\n### Input:\"Duke is 12 years old and his sister is twice as old as Duke.

We can determine this by dividing the number of minutes she spends talking with customers each week by the number of customers. This gives us 50/50 or 10.\nNext, we need to add 5 for five minutes each, giving us a total of 15 minutes.

The reason we use the term logical is that these phrases are not the result of the children guessing from nowhere, but they are consistent with the general idea that children share that the woman wants to give her child a safe place while shopping.\n\n### If you have been following the previous instruction, you are able to understand that these statements: _The toddlers are safe_, _The toddler is not hungry_, and _The toddler has a place to sit_ make logical sense. In other words, they are all consistent with the general idea of the woman\u2019s desire to give her child a place to sit safely, as well as with the idea that children can understand that their cries about being hungry are ignored when the toddler does not receive anything they ask for.\n\n### By noticing the statements the children make and what is not said, we can assume a few logical ideas:\n\n### Answer to the question above: _The toddle is not hungry_.\n\n### If we had a context or situation in which the toddler was not hungry, we might be able to assume that they need nothing.\n### The toddler had a place to sit? _Why does she need more food?_\n\n### In the original situation presented, there was no indication that the toddler did not have food.\n### We could say that _the children are safe_ from other dangers, such as food cravings or hunger.\n\n### As you can see, we use logic to answer statements logically and not to fill in gaps or questions that are missing from the text or answer the questions that are asked", "answer": " 2210"}

We observe the information given in the two rows of the problem: Carrie is wrapping three birthdays. Each present needs 2 square feet of wrapping paper. The second present needs 3-quarters of the amount but the third present needs the same. Given this information, we know that each present needs 2 square ft. of gift. Multiply 2 by 3 and the result is 6 square ft. This is one square foot for each wrap. This will be used as part of the final answer. Also, we know the second gift needs an additional 3-quarters of 2 square feet. Multiply 3/4 by 2 and we get 6.25, an additional half square foot needed for the second gift. Finally, the third gift needs the addition of all three presents combined. The multiplication of 6 and 6.25 gives the answer of 39.5 square feet.

So the answer is six pencils.\n\n### Input\nOne of the reasons why a student decides not to take on a science subject is because he feels it\u2019s too difficult. From this, it is evident that science is considered difficult to learn, and thus discourages potential scholars from studying in this field. However, some students with little or no motivation who try to understand science concepts are successful, such as the one who became inspired to take on a science course as a way of pursuing a career to cater to his curiosity and to help patients. He is an exemplary student who overcame the difficulty of studying science that discouraged others.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. This passage emphasizes that science is difficult for students to learn\n\n2. Some students with little or no science knowledge are successful in learning sciences\n\n3. The passage shows a positive outlook of an exemplar student who faced difficulties in science\n\n4. It also suggests that science is a useful way for people with curiosity\n\n### A. If students do not have much motivation to learn science, they will become too discouraged to overcome their difficulties in the subject.\n\n### B. Most students who lack motivation in science become disheartened once they face a challenging situation.\n\n### C. The difficulty in studying sciences encourages people to take on a career or major in the field.\n\n### D. Students have to feel motivated to take a science subject, which will hinder them from achieving success and learning important life lessons.\n\n### E. Even if science can be found interesting, students may not pursue it as a career or major because it is seen to be difficult to study and learn.", "answer": " 20"}

Because the biggest storm was on Monday and Tuesday, and two-thirds of the total weekly rainfall occurred before Friday, the average daily rainfall is approximately equal to the (Tuesday rain total minus half of the Monday and Tuesday rain totals), which is (5 + (5/2)) inches.  The rainfall on Thursday was two-thirds of that total, so the average is (2/7ths + 2/7ths).  When calculating the average, it is important to first eliminate the effect of the greatest rainfall, in this case the rain on Friday.

Choice A. weight - Weight has at least some impact on speed (e.g., a heavy person may be slower than a light person) but it is not the only one.\n2. Choice B. gender - A man may be faster than a woman at running a mile but there are exceptions. Plus, gender is not the only factor that impacts speed, so it can be ruled out.\n3.

However, they overlap in the sense that condition impacts the pace at which a runner is able to move - for example, someone with poor health may not be able to run as quickly as someone who is in good health.

{"text": "A\n\n### Input:\"A\" was input as the answer to a math question when Elliot and Merill had twice as many marbles and Selma had 5 more marbles than Elliot and Merill. We know (5 * 2) < M, however, we still need to verify that (5 * 2)+ M < S. So far, we've calculated that (A-5) < S, which is true because A < S. Now, let's subtract (A-5) from M, which equals M-A+5. To confirm that these numbers are less than S, let's first write M-A+5 < S. When we plug in the numbers directly, we have M-A+5(2*33)+5 < 50*33, therefore, M(3*33)+20 < 50*50 which is true. Therefore, option A is the best answer.\n\n### Input:#I'm a math professor.

Choices: 1. A: 0.1074 B: 1.6241 C: 1 D: 1.9687 E: 2.8284\nRationales:1. the number is 0.1 x 100 = 10, and the decimal fraction of 10 is 1/10 = 0.1\n2. The question states that the value of the given integer can be expressed as a decimal fraction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the difference between the value and the decimal fraction of the given integer will be zero.\n3. Further analysis of the choices available indicates that one has to add a decimal point to the given integer before it is expressed as a fraction.\n4. For example, if x = 3, the decimal fraction that would be obtained by dividing x by 10 is 0.3. \n5. Therefore, the correct choice is choice D, 1.96, since the difference between the integer and its decimal fraction in this case equals 107.4 and the decimal fraction of x is 0.10, where adding a decimal point to x gives 1 0.10. \n6. Since option A: 0.01 is incorrect because there is no decimal point added to the given integer, while option B: 1.5002 is too long, since the given integer and its decimal equivalent in this case should each take up two digits.\n7. Therefore, option C: 2 is incorrect in terms of accuracy.\n8. Thus the answer is D: 1.57.4\nAnswer: D: 1.60", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "Rationales:\n\n1. This question contains a diagram which illustrates the sports cars mentioned in the passage. Let's read the instruction and understand what the problem is about.\n\n2. The instruction says,\n\n\"Dale owns 6 sports cars. The red car can travel at twice the speeds of the green car, but the green car can travel at 8 time more speed than blue car. The yellow car is broken and cannot move. If the blue car can travel at the speed 80 miles per hours, the question will be asked about the speed at which the red car can travel.\"\n\n3. The question requires us to deduce a range of speed that the red car can travel given that we know the speeds of the yellow car, the green car, the blue car, and the red car.\n\n4. First, we calculate the top speed of the yellow car.\n\n\"Dale has a broken car, the yellow car.\"\n\n5. We can exclude the green car, because it is the green car, we have known the top speed of it.\n\n\"Damn, the green car is at the speed of 8 time more speed of the blue car.\"\n\n6. The blue car is at a speed of 0.\n\n\"The broken car, the yellow one. But its speed was 80 miles per h.\"\n\n7. Now we can exclude the blue car as a whole, because it is now inexistent and the green car's speed cannot be any less or more than what blue has.\n\n8. The red car can then travel at more than twice the speed of the yellow car, therefore, the speed of yellow car has to be more than twice the speed, therefore, the speed should be greater than 160 miles per hour.\n\n9. We have two choices, either the red car should travel at more than 160 which is very dangerous due to the fact that it could be too high speed, or the red car should travel below 160.\n\n10. We can therefore conclude that the red car should travel somewhere around 140 miles per hour.", "answer": " 1280"}

{"text": "In the instructions, it is stated that Maisie and Donna had to deliver flyers. Maisie walked down a shorter left street and dropped 33 flyers on her way, while Donna, on her bicycle, took the long right street and delivered more than twice as many as Maisie. In addition, we are told that overall Donna dropped more flyers than Maisie. The next question asked us to determine how many flyers Donna dropped, which implies that the total number on both streets is known. Furthermore, we can assume that the number of flyers per street is not equal since we know that Donna delivered more than thrice as many flyers. It is helpful to note that both streets had at least 37 and 38 flyers at first - otherwise, there would be no way for Donna to double the number of flyers that Maisie had to drop. Because it is specifically stated that Donna dropped more than twice as many, we can take the two streets and write them as equal, i.e., n and 2n. We must write Donna's contribution as more than twice what Maisie delivered. Consequently, we know that Donna dropped the following number of flyers: \\[(2n)-(33)\\approx 84.\\]", "answer": " 71"}

In the parable about the prodigal son who returns to his father, a parable described in Luke 15:11-32, the son shows a great sense of remorse.\n\nOutput: We need to analyse the given context to identify a contextual similarity between the examples. However, the first example can be misconstrued to be the correct answer. Parable and simile are literary devices used to enhance a narrator's message.\n\nOutput: A parable is a type of literary device that often involves a story to demonstrate a religious ideal of behavior. A parable can also be expressed metaphorically. This means the story portrays an indirect, abstract meaning. The Biblical books often use parables in this manner, with examples being the story of the Good Samaritan and the prodigal son.\n\n### Output \uf0e0 In the context of the given question, the second example better fits the criteria of being a parable. The first sample does not have a narrative story with an indirect or allegorical message - rather, it has a literal narrative explanation.\nResponse: Hence, the parable is the second example.\n\n### Response 2: A simile is a literary device that is used to directly compare the similarities between two or more items by using some type of connection.

He realized that everyone at his workplace  liked to get free drinks from the company, and the fact that they would work longer for free drinks.  He did not provide free drinks, but he started to reward workers with free drinks for showing up early, working longer hours, and for not taking lunch breaks.  Which of these actions will have the greatest effect on improving the morale of all workers?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: A business is considering whether to allow employees to take a lunch break on a Monday- Thursday schedule. According to their records, the break is causing at least 4% of customer phone calls to be ignored that day because 4% of the people in the company have decided to take a lunch time break. The company hopes that providing a lunch break on Mon - Thurs could increase sales by at least 2% a day, but the company also knows that 4% of all incoming calls are always ignored on those days. If the company were to eliminate the lunch break it would likely save 9% of the calls that are always ignored. On the other hand, the company has also been considering eliminating the first customer service representative available for each phone call. Because they work alone, the only way to save on employee costs is to have each employee answer more and more calls. They know that if they stop having only one person initially answer the phone, customers will actually be served 8% faster.

There are only 2 dozen of these appetizers indicated, so we can eliminate this response.\nOption B: 24 dozen appetizers would equal one dozen of deviled eggs, all 60 of the pigs in the blankets and 72 of the kebabs. While there are enough pigs in blankets and kebabs for the 30 guests, there are still only 12 dozen apps shown and we know that more appetizes were stated as necessary.  To be safe, it is recommended to go back to option A and eliminate it.\nOption C: 42 dozen appetizers includes the 2 dozen kebab and a total of 68 of the required appetizers. With the initial 3 dozen of deviled eggs and 1 dozen of pigs in a blankest (not shown), we still have the correct number of required appestores.

The number of cups of birdseed each feeder can hold is 2. Since there are 2 feeder for 2 cups.\n\t2. The amount of bird seed that is stolen is 0.5. Since each half cup of bird seed can feed 2 birds, this half cup taken is equivalent to 2 birds and therefore subtracted from 2 cups per feeder, hence 2 cups (0.5) = 1\n\t3. Since Ivan's bird feeler fees 14 birds per cup, 14 birds were fed by each cup of bird seed. \n\t4.

{"text": "Rationales:\n\n1. Answer: (425m)\n2. Analysis:\n3. The athlete in the provided scenario first throws the javelin twice the amount he/she threw it on his/her second throw. Therefore, the first throw is equal to two times the second throw.\n4. Next, the javelin thrower throws the javelin on the third time at half of what he/she threw on the second throw, which is equal to 1/2 of 1050m = 525m.\n5. Combining the first throw\u2019s value and the third throw\u2019s value, we get 1050 = 2 * x + 1/2 * 525 = 1050 \u2013 525 = $525\n6. If we subtract the second throw from the combined total, we\u2019ll get the value of the first throw. This is the best approach to solving such a word problem.\n7. Thus, the javelin was thrown a total of 525 + 262.5 = 787.5 m in the first throw. The athlete will likely have not used all of their available strength on the first throw, and only began to throw at full capacity on his/her second and third throws as the competition progressed.\n8.

Two minutes later, the two seedling to the right of the first seedling grow faster than the first one. What directions are all five seedlings now facing?\n\n### Answer\nNorth south east and west. This is logical as the sun is at the southern direction. Thus, it takes 90 minutes till the sun is the eastern direction so the first tree of the first row is in a north-east position.

{"text": "Rationales:\n1. The original context states the problem was to 'divide' the total 20 muffin snacks equally between Jessie and her friends.\n2. The task requested is to calculate how many muffins each friend will get.\n3. To calculate this, we need to find the solution which yields a division of 20 evenly between Jessie and her 4 friends.\n4. Let's suppose we knew the solution to the problem in the question and we wanted to find the method used.\n5. Let's consider the 4 friends as having the code names: A, B, C, D. If we assign a letter to each friend, it will be easier to see the divisibility by: (2)+(3)+(6)=11; it's not exactly equal to 20 but the remainder is zero for the value of 20.\n6. 20 is a special number because it can be exactly divided only by the number one (1), itself (20/20) and by some even numbers.\n7. In other words, it's 20/2 = 10\n8. In order to divide 5 muffins among A, B, C and D we need to first count how many times 1, 2 or 5 go into 5.\n9. So divide 5 by 1= 5 5\u00f72= 2.5 5\u00f75=1\n10. This gives a division factor of 1,2,5 which can evenly distribute the muffins across the 4 friends.\n11. Therefore, we know the method used is to divide each by 1, 2, 5, and to round off the remainder to the nearest whole number.\nAnswer: 5\n\n### Input:(B)\nI was hungry for a fresh-brewed cup of coffee in the morning.

{"text": "12\n\nRationales:\n\n1. Given the facts and question, the quantity of cookies is 12 when Ted leaves. He has taken 4 cookies and there are 8 remaining.\n2. One way to figure out the number of remaining cookies is to count the trays or trays left, each which should contain 12 remaining cookies.\n\nThe choice for 14 is incorrect because it involves taking an extra cookie to get to the total left (12).\nThe choice for 8 is incorrect because it leaves only 4 cookies, which is not the answer.\n\n\n\n### Instructor\u2019s Comment\nIt appears that the issue your student is having is with reading the prompt and correctly answering the question presented. First, it is advised that they read all the information in the passage and identify any unknown words or phrases by looking them up using a dictionary or online thesaurus. Then, the student should circle any words or symbols, such as the \u201c^\u201d operator, and re-read the question to understand the meaning being expressed. Next, they should underline the \u201casking\u201d portion of the question, such as \u201cwho is the most important person\u201d and analyze any details (who, what, when, where, why) present or missing from the question. Afterwards, the student should look for the best answer using the facts provided in the passage. When they have identified the best answer, they should write in words. This process may seem arduous at first but once students become accustomed to it, choosing the correct answer will become easier. When completing a math question, they should read each expression from left to right (like a sentence) to understand the mathematical operations conducted. Then, they should read the entire expression again but this time starting at the right side (as if reading a book). This will help them understand the order of operations in the problem. If they were to find the area of a triangle, for instance, the student will need to understand how to find the base of the triangle and then follow the rules of operations to solve the problem. Overall, a more robust approach to reading and math comprehension can assist in improving their response options.", "answer": " 134"}
{"text": "I'm confident that what we've analysed is what the author has envisaged. This is because of the presence of a context-specific question:\nDuring March, Susannah did exercise 24 times while Camden did 16 times. A situation like this is similar to our own real-life experiences when we make a comparison and contrast. If someone exercises twice as often as us, how often does this someone need to exercise for us to exercise as much times as him/her? And if this someone exercised more often than us, how often does he/she need to exercise for us?\n\n### So, we should write 24/24 * 16/24 = 12/16 = 50% * 2 is 100%\n\n### For instance, if an individual had to run for 100 miles to reach a specified goal. In the same way, Susannah\u2019s workout routine should be no less than 20 times per month to allow her to remain in shape as much as Camden.\n\n### So the answer to the question is 24-16=8=242-162\n\n### There is a 242 percentage increase on how much times Susannah exercises.\n\n### In other words, Susannah exercising 8 times more than Camden\n\n### Answer:8\n\n### Input How do you respond or react when someone hits you?

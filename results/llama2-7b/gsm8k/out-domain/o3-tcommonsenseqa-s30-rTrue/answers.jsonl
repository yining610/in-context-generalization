As of now 346 have been spent \n2. Alexis has 4 dollars left to her budget \n3. So she should spend only $4 dollars in remaining in her store account to cover all her expenses. \n4. Now she was left only 18$ to cover for her complete budget. She had already spent 18+4=22dollars. This means she has got a balance of only 1$ dollars in her account.\n5. Therefore, Alex can only buy another suit of 1$ dollars. But at the end she spent 12 dollars for her socks. \n\nSo she has spent 18+12=30 dollars on socks and pants only.

There are only four choices in the question and it cannot be determined if anyone is currently the mayor or if one of the candidates from the general election is currently the mayor.  The last sentence implies that there is a race for mayor between a selection of opponents. There would only be four candidates.\nOption D is the best choice, as the word \u201cis\u201d implies a single choice. The mayoral race, as it stands in the context of this question, can only have one winner or one loser, depending on your perspective of the political issues.

We have 10 units, which is the GAM for both daughters who both play on the same team. We can refer to GAM as 10. Now we have 2. As a result of this practice, we can refer to the time in hours or the units it consists of. We can refer to it as PTIME. The practice time for both daughters together is PTIME = PTIME + PTIME = 2*.\nSince both daughters play on the same team so their practice time is equal. As a result, we can say that we can divide the practice time into a multiple of two, which will be a total of 8.\nSince each game lasts for an hour and half, or 1, we can refer to each game as 1. In addition, Jerry himself plays an important part in both practice and games, so he has to be there for both. The time he spends for only practice will be as a result of PTIME. Similarly, if we want to refer to the time he spends for just the game, we will have to use 1 - PTIME. \nHence, we have PTIME + 1.

Let's use some math to calculate: \n2.1) x Gallons of Milk = (x(1/10)-10)/(6-10) = 50\n2.2) x(1/10) = x\n2.3) x10 - 10 = 50\n3) x10 = 40 then x10-10 = 30.\n4) 40 - 30 = 10. This means that it requires 10 gallons of milk to prepare 50 quart cans of fruit drink. \nSo the final answers are 10 gallons.\n\nInput: You are planning to purchase an old pickup", "answer": " 100"}

So this can be discarded.\n\nOption B: \u201cMy family member\u2019s name is needed.\u201d-This option doesn\u2019t fit into the context of the situation, as this person doesn\u2019t have a family member to provide additional information.

So, this can be discarded along with a \u201cpet'S\u201d name.\nOption D: \u201cMy pet'S name is needed to solve that problem\u201d- Similar to option C.\nWe can see that although a \u201cpet'S name\u201d may not be relevant to the situation, a \u201cpet's number\u201d also is not necessary. So, the \u201cpet's number\u201d, as well as the \u201cpet's\u201d name, are both unnecessary to solve this particular problem. \n\nLastly, I will choose Option E:\u201cMy name is unrelated to my problem\u201d.

{"text": "1)The question is asking to find the distance, in miles, of two points on a map, called points Pence and Hillcest. The map has a scale of 1:200000, and 1/4 in = 8 miles of actual distance.\n2)The distance between Pence and Hillcres can be calculated as follows:\n3)First, measure the actual distances of 1/4 in and 3 3/16 in to find the actual length of each unit of the map, in miles. It is given that 4/16/miles = 1 inch, and 1 in = 8 miles, we can state that 4/12 miles = 20000 in, which in turn means that 4 in = (20000 x 4)/100 = 80000). Thus, the actual distance between Pence and 1/4 th of a inch is 8 miles.\n4)The distance between the points on the map, which we have been given, is actually 3 3/ 8 inches apart. Therefore, we have the actual distance. Substituting it into the distance formula gives -3 3/8 x 8 = 34 4/16 miles.\nSo, therefore, the answer is 34 4/-16 miles.\n\nInput:A 9 foot by 14 foot rectangular carpet costs $45.60 per foot to purchase and $2.75 per square foot to install.

However, this would mean that Linda spent a total of more than $25, which is impossible since she got no change.\n4) Option B: '$4' also seems attractive as it divides into the entire sum of $25 fairly evenly. However, this would also mean that the coloring book is the same price as the peanuts,  or that the coloring books are twice as expensive as they need to be, which does not make sense.\n5) Option C: '$3' has almost the same numerator as option A. However, this number does not divide into the sum of $25, or account for the given information. \n6) Option D: '$0.50' would explain how Linda could have come up with $25 from her payment of $25 + $2 + $0.50.

The person does not have that much money and needs to find $200 to get the $700 total. \n4. The shop owner gives the person a 15% discount, which means that they will pay $150 less for the clothes than they would normally. \n5. Therefore, the person will need to find $700 + $150 or $850 in total. 6. Since $850 is $700 more than the person has, the person will not be able to purchase the clothes.\nSo the final answers is C: The person would not be able to purchase any clothes because she does not have enough money for them\n\nInput: What could make a good friend?

{"text": "The answer is given below. The question asks how many times Tammy caught the ball after Joe and Derek caught the ball \"23 times, Joe caught the ball 24 times, then Derek made four less double the catches.\" The first thing that needs to be clarified is the meaning of the sentence, \"four less than double the catch.\" The first two numbers, \"two\" and \"three\" should be the number of catches he made, \"times more than a third of 24,\" which should be called as double the catch. As a result, the catch number for Derek is four. Joe and Tammy each caught the ball six times. The last number in the series, six, was the result of eight. The answer is sixteen (6 x 2). Sixteen was the ball Tammy captured the most (the third time). Thus, Tammy got the ball 17 times throughout the game.\n\nInput: What are some of the effects of a strong wind?

Only if he needed to save money for something, which he would do, would he earn more than the $600 by working for eight five-month hours\nOption B, \u2018he was only able to work,\u2019 is true, but it does not involve the number hours he works. By excluding hours not working, it does not answer the question of how much money Sam earns\nOption C, \u2018Sam has already spent $30 to fix his car.\u2019 does not affect his number of hours and would not affect his income\nOption E, \u2018does he earn a total of more than $215 over the next five months,\u2019 is true. If he earns $340 over five months, he would have more than $210 for the next five months, but since he needs $600 for the console, he needs 16 more hours. This is a trick question in the same manner that a question in algebra asks for x, when x is the answer to the question! If he needs $60 to be exactly $210 over 5 months, he needs 40 more hours to be $340 over 5 months\nOption D, $60 (10) is a factor of $600. Thus, he needs 60 more hours, rather than 40. This answer is a direct result of the logic being used that x equals the answer: he needs to earn $340 to replace $340. It is also an easy way to recognize that D is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is D: $60 (60)\n\n##### Summary\n* The most correct answer choice will always be the answer that aligns with the logic of the question.\nThe correct answer choice is also the most obvious answer.", "answer": " 16"}

There are 156 unchecked out books. What is the probability that:  A: all books will not be available by the emergency. B: none will. C: some will be available. D: many will be available. E: none will be available.\nOutput: The question presents the scenario where there is a demand for more books than there are available books in the library. Our task is to calculate what the probability is that all of the books will be available. This means that out of 156 books, there are none that are checked out, but someone still could potentially not be able to check out a book.\nTherefore, we first count the checks out that we know exactly are not in the library. For example, if the person counts their books, let's say they have 98 books. Therefore 98 books are not the ones that we are looking for, so our total left over is 68 books. Now, let's say someone checks out a book that is not taken and left in the library(and we don't know that it is still left in the library, because we don't have their book count). Now we have 67 books to choose from, not the actual 68. So the probability is 67/68=0.978 or close to 1, meaning high chance that not everyone will be able to borrow a book.\nSo the final probability is D: most likely not all, or many will not be able to borrow a books and therefore E: the probability will most likely be less than 99.9 per cent is the most likely answer.\n\nInput: Given a number, is it greater", "answer": " 234"}

{"text": "Let's break down the question and analyze each component.\n1. To make $100, Steve is working to pick lingonberries, a fruit grown in Sweden.\n2. With this in mind, the question can be rephrased as follows:\n\"Steve wanted to make $100 within 4 days, so he took a berry-pick job in Sweden. The position paid $2 for each pound of lingonberry picked. On Monday, He picked 8 pounds. On Tuesday, It tripled and he picked 24 pounds. He rested on Wednesday. He has to pick on Thursdays, how many pounds would he pick?\n3. The question essentially asks how many berries Steve would have to pick on Friday to make $10,000 after factoring his berry picking over the first 3 days?\n4. After examining the provided statements, the following can be understood: On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds of berries, which came to a total of $16.\n5. On Tuesday he picked triple the amount of berries picked on Monday, so he picked 24 or triple 8 pounds which comes to 24 pounds or $48.\n6. On Wednesday, he rests. For Wednesday, we can assume he didn't pick berries because Thursday is the day he will start picking berries to reach his goal.\n7. On Thursday, Steve will pick berries.\n8. So the day Steve picks berries (Friday) is not considered as a working day.\n9. The goal is to make $10 for every pound of berries he's picked.\n10.

{"text": "Let's use the equation d = 3/4 * (d+2)-(d+2)/2 where: d = dog, h = hamster, f = fish \n1. The question provides specific information about the lengths of a dog's, a hamster's, and a fish's lives.\n2. We can formulate a simple equation to determine the length of an overabundance of time.\n3. We can use the formula to calculate the length of a fish's life. \na. First, we need to know the dog's life. That's d=4 dog's longevity. So d=4: \nb. Next we need to know the hamster's life. That h=2.5 hamster longevity.(d+2)/d=4 so d+2=6.5hamster life.  Therefore d+2=65.(hamster life)  So we subtract 5 from 6 then add 5 back: 10+5=15  (d +2)\nc. Finally we're left with this equation for fish: f=d+2-15   So f=d  Plus 13 and 13=25  So f = d + 25\nd.  So f= d+25=2-18.  That means fish=6 years.\n4. Hence, we can conclude that the fish can live for 6 years. \nSo the final answer to the question \"To let Ruth know how many years her fish will live, how long can a typical dog live?\" is 6 years\n\nInput: If a student is 4/7 as old as her mother, how old is the mother?

We know daughter's age is 1/4th of her mother's age.  Therefore the mother's age must be 4/1=4. \na", "answer": " 12"}

The box is not of the same dimensions as the building block, so it cannot be filled with the latter.\n5 possibilities are evaluated in terms of their plausibility as candidates for a solution. \n6. Option A: '8' - The box has a height of 8 inches. Since a single box can be filled with 8 wooden building blocks, this is not a plausible answer.\n7. When 16 building blocks are placed inside the box, they would exceed 3 inches, so 16 building blocks cannot fit into the box.\n8.

Let's say Yolanda's husband finally catches up to her after traveling 20 miles. This means that after traveling his additional 15 miles, Yolanda has covered 15 miles in 13.33 minutes, or an average of 235.28 feet per minute.\n4: From this we know that, at this point in her journey, the speed she is going is 532.49 feet per minute.\n5: We can then divide each mile by this speed to get the time it takes for Yolanda to cover each mile.\n6: Yolanda's miles per hour will thus be 70.33 MPH.\n7: 9.53 x 70.325 =160.725 mph.\n8: If Yolanda is riding at 20.0 miles per hour and her husband at first follows her, it would take 210 minutes or 3.5 hours (60 * 40 mph) for him to catch up with Yolanda.\n9: So, her husband catches up with her in 161 minutes (2 Hours 41 minutes).\nSo the final answer will be B: 161", "answer": " 15"}

This problem involves estimating a calorie intake when the dietitian's total calorie intake is unknown, the amount of food eaten during the lunch break is unknown, and the amount of recommended calories is known. This can be represented as follows: \n\n`CAL_INTAKE \u2248 ((FOOD_AMOUNT / 4) x PER_FOOD_CALORIES) - FDA_CLASSIFICATION`\n\nWhere PER_FOOD CALORIES is the calorie value of each piece of food eaten.\n\nThe question asks to find out how many more calories the dietitian consumed than what is recommended by the FDA.\nTo answer this question, the relationship between the variables and data should be evaluated.\n\nOption A: To answer this question, the food amount eaten during the labeled break could be estimated by using the ratio of the food amount eaten the total food amount. This is possible if the total food amount was known, but it is uncertain in this example, so this is not a valid answer.\n\nOption B: The calorie intake of the dietitian is estimated by using the ratio between the total food eaten during lunch and the total amount of food in the food.\n\nOption C: The recommended calorie intake as well as the classification for it can be found by using the information from the previous statements. This also requires the user to have all the data available. This is also not a valid answer, as it requires data that is not present in the given information.\n\nOption D: An answer close to the correct one of more than 5 calories above is 59, as the food amount eaten is 0, the total food amount is 40, the per food calories value is 1, and the FDA classification is 50. This can be checked by substituting for each value. This shows the accuracy of choosing more than 5 caloric value exceeding the FDA classification.\n\nOption E: The correct answer has all 4 values equal, showing the highest accuracy within the answer options.\nTherefore this can be concluded that Option D is the best answer.\nSo the final option D is more than 5 cal", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "1) The question asks how long it will take Carla to cook 3 chicken-fried steaks and a batch or waffles, given that she can cook a batch of one in 10 minutes, and a chicken-fried steaked in 6 minutes.\n2) Let's begin by creating a table with a column labeled chicken-fried steake, and another column labeled waffles. Each row in the table will represent 8 minutes. Given that the total time can be calculated as waffles + 6 x chicken-fried steakes, let's evaluate various possible values. For example, 35 x 6 = 210 for the number of chicken fried steaks, and 10 + 210 = 220 for the waffles.\n3) Let's do some calculations based on various number of chicken fries steaks and number of waffles.\n4) We can begin by examining values where chicken fries steak would be calculated as 4, which is less than total time.\n4) If we have 30 chicken fried steak and 20 waffles, adding the total takes 10+6x(30+20), and so we want 30+20 to equal 220. That means 70+20=130.\n5) So this is not able to satisfy the condition.\n6) If we have 20 chicken fried stakes and 20 wafers, adding 10+6(20+20), then it is unable to satisfy the condition. We are required to have (30+20) + 6(20+10) or 70+220 because chicken friends is always more than wafers.\n7) Then, when we will have 40 chicken fried steel and 40 wafers, it will take 10+6*40, so we are need 80 waffles since we have 40 extra waffles on the left. 80 + 40 is 120 which is not able to satisfy condition.\n8) Therefore, we conclude that it will take 120 minutes to do this cooking where she has done", "answer": " 28"}

We're told that 5 weeks has passed in which the output of these cows was measured, and the total litres collected was 2160\n2. We can find the total for each week: 6 x 108 + 108 +... + (6 x 10) + 160 = 524 + 160 +... + 660 + 160 total = 2160, so that the total is 2160 l/w.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that for this particular period, each cow produced no more than 2160 / 5 or 432 l/w. \n4. But, 432 times 6 is still more than 108 so the output each cow must have surpasses 108 but less than 432. We can round 108 to the next number (112) and state that each must be at least 112.\n5. So, at least 236 is required to meet the output of 112. \n6. Next, we multiply 236 times 6, and see that this adds up to just over 1400. \n7.

To solve the problem, first, we can estimate the number of male members in the club. Considering that there are 2 times as many female than males, the ratio of males is to females is 1:2.\n9. Let's call this ratio A, we can rewrite this as A=2/1=2.\n10. So, the number of male members can be expressed as 18/2=9.\n11. Then, we can find the number of female members in the club. Given that the gender ratio is 2:1, we can apply the formula for the complementary ratio ((1:2) x (1:3)).\n12.

To solve the question, it's necessary to first identify the key information provided and to formulate a mathematical equation to represent the problem.\n3. The information provided is:\n(A) Lloyd has 80 cards\n(B) Mark has 30 cards, and\n(C) Michael, has 100 additional cards\n\n4. We can express the problem mathematically with the equation:\ntotal cards = 80 + 30 + (100 + 100) = 300\n(D) Each person is therefore holding 3/10 of the cards collectively.\n5. For Lloyd to have 500 cards alone, we can solve the equation:\n (total cards / 3) for Lloyd, where\n(total cards / 3):100 \n(total cards /3): 50 \n(total / 3): 166\n6. Therefore, Lloyd requires 166 additional cards to have a total of of 500.\n7. To find how many cards Mark and Michael need so all three hold 500 cards, we can substitute 166 for Lloyd in the equation:\n(300 total cards / 3) or (100 total cards /3) for Lloyd = 93\n(10 total for Lloyd ): 0\n(total cards / LLOYD ) = 93 for Lloyd\n(total cards / Mark) = 103\n(total cards / Michael) = 67\n\n8. From Lloyd's new total of 259 cards, his share is 41%, so to get the total share of all three people collectively, each person's share would be 33% of total cards collectively.\n9.

The expression \u201cthree times more\u201d can be interpreted as a triple increase, meaning the fishmonger's sales more than tripled in the following week.\n3. The first week the fishmonger sells 50 kg of fish, and the 2nd he sells 50 * 3 kg.\n4. To continue the pattern, in the 3rd week this implies he\u2019s selling the triple of the 2nd week. Let\u2019s define the general term as (d):\n5. Therefore, if we follow this logical pattern, the fishmongers sales would be:\n6. At the end of the 3rd week, the fishmoger sold 50 * 9 kg.\n7. Which adds to a total of d = (d-1) + (d-1) = (d-1)(d-1)\n8. Thus, after two weeks of fish sales, the total sold is 50 * 2 *d. As a final result: 1d + 1d = 2d.\n9. Solving our initial equation for 'd': 2d = (1d+1d)\n10. This has a solution for 'd': (2d)/(1+2)=\n11. d = (2d) / (1+2) = (d)/ (2+1)!\n12. As a result, the total amount of fish he sold in two weeks was 100 * (d)/((2+1)) = 50kg.\n13. We can interpret (100 * (100/2+1)) as 100 kg * (50 + the amount he sold in week 3)\n14.

When mark returns the change, how many do mark get in his change? \n1)The amount that Mark gets in his change would depend on the combination of the cashier's change, the number of quarters and dime that mark has, and the total amount that Mark brings. \n2)In order to determine the exact number of nickels mark returns, one must first find the exact amount of change that mark receives: \nMark=100(4:20+2:05) : 1:00+1:00+($4:20+$2:05) = 18:05 + $4:20 +$2:05 : 1:05+1:05+$4:20 + $2:05 = 9:15 in nickels, 11 nickels and 2 quarters are returned.\nMark can't have 9:15+2 : 3 = 19:20 in nickels as there is no more dime now. Therefore, there are 19:21+2 :3 = 19 : 21 in total that Mark gets in change.\n3)As the 9:15 nickels represents three quarters, it is clear that each of the quarters is worth 5 nickels which means that each quarter represents 6 nickels of the 9: 15 return.\n4)Hence, each of the dimes is worth 105 (9:15 x 5) and each one should return 105 : 4 = 26 (105 \u00f7 4).\n5)To find the total amounts of coins that mark gets, simply add 0.25 (0.25 X 2), 0.5 (0.5 X 2) and 1.00(1.00 X 2) nickels for total 4.5 quarters for mark. \nSo the final answer to the question is 19:25 in nick", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "First, you'll need to understand that the term \"sales tax\" usually refers to a specific percentage of the total cost of a good or service that is taxed. The service charge is not sales tax; it's an additional fee charged by a restaurant or other establishment. Sales tax is 10% in the shopper's city and was included in the original total bill.\nSecond, you'll need a basic understanding of how tip is taxed. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS ), \"tip income\"  is taxable income, just like salary or wages. However, tip income that an employee receives is only included in their taxable income if the tip income exceeds the tips they report on their paychecks. If the tips reported on their paychecks exceed their taxable income, they can deduct the difference from their taxable income.\nThird, you'll need information about how much the shopper paid for each item to determine their total bill. The shopper paid $80 for their New York striploin and $10 for their wine. Their total bill, therefore, is $90.\nFourth, you'll need an understanding of fractions to be able to calculate the tip the restaurant charged. The restaurant calculated the amount to charge in gratuity as 20% of the shopper's total bill, which is $46.\nFinally, you'll need some basic arithmetic skills to perform the calculation. To get the gratuity, you simply multiply the original total ($90) by 0.2 ($46). Therefore, the restaurant charged the shopper a $46 gratuity.\nSo the final solution is 20%*140, which is 28 is 46 answer so the final answer is 28.\n\nInput: I had a 16\" piece of sheeting left over.

Each of Berries are Strawberry, Raspberry and Heavy cream. 4+2+1=7.So we need to find out the amount of strawberry and raspberry to be added for making 8 quarter of strawberry ice-cream and 8 quarter of raspberry ice-cream respectively.\n3. As we need to add these in 1 cup and 4 cup package. So for adding in 1 cup, need to multiply 4 and subtract 2. Thus for adding 1 quarts we require 8 berry for strawberry ice-ice and 7 for raspberry ice-ice. So Martha will require strawberry 8+8=16 to make 1 quarts of strawberry icecream and raspberry 7+7=6 for making 1 quarts of raspberry ice -cream.\n4. 4. For making strawberry icecreams, she requires 16+1=17 strawberries so the total cost for making 8 quarts of strawberries will be 17*5= 85 and similarly making 8 quarters of raspberry icecream she will require 6+1=7 so will be 7*4=28.\n5. As 85 to 28= 57.Thus total cost for making 1 quartern of both strawberry and ransberry icecream=57+57=114.\n6.

While buying fruit at the store, she bought a total of 12 items, which included 6 pears,4 Granny Smith appples, 2 pine apples and a small basket of pliums. Later, while walking home, half of the items fell out of the bag and only 9 pieces of fruit are left.\n5 Choice A is not the correct answer because the answer can be found from the question itself. When we combine the question with the information given in the question, we see that there is a hole in the paper bag, so the number of total plums is 2/2 = 1. Therefore there are 1 plum left in the bag, not 3.\n6 Choice B is not the correct answer either, because we know that when Tanya was shopping, she bought a basket of plums, so the number of plum she already had in her shopping bag is 1. Hence we cannot subtract 1 from the number of fruit left, because when she went into the store, she already had 1 plum.\n7 Choice C is also not the correct answer. When we look at the question carefully, a basket of plums cannot be counted to be of the same weight as a pear or apple. This could be inferred because the question did not mention buying any other fruit other than plums, pears and apples. Hence a basket of plums can be assumed to be lighter than any other food item and therefore cannot be counted as one.\n8 Choice D is the correct answer. When combined with the question and the information given, we can see that there are 9 pieces of fruit left in the bag. When Tanya added 6 pears,1 of basket of plums, 4 Granny smith apples and 2 pineapplez together these gave her 12 items. Therefore 9 \u2013 12 = -3 or -3 pieces of fruits were lost, because 9 is the sum of all pieces of fruit left in there.\nSo the final answe is D: -3\n\nInput:  You\u2019ve been asked to help install a new operating system on your computer.

{"text": "There are a few steps to solving the problem.\n1. We will first determine the total amount of running needed to complete one lap.\n2. Then we will determine the amount of energy Ian will consume while running.\n3. Finally we will determine Ian's progress over time.\nSolution:\n4. There are 18 feet in 100 feet (100 feet \u00f7 5.5 yd = 18 ft), hence each lap of Ian's run would be 18 feet in length.\n5. We also know that each lap covers a distance of 100 feet, so we have\n\n$ 18 \\text{ feet} \\times 5 = 90 \\text{ feet} $\n\nand that 90 feet is equal to 100 feet minus 10 feet. Therefore each lap of Ian' s run is 90 feet  long.\n6. One calorie is defined as the amount of energy necessary to heat one gram of water by 1 C. Since the water boils at 100 C, one calorie equals 100,000 joules of heat.\n\n7. One Joule is a unit of work equal to the mechanical work done on a body by 1 Newton in 1 meter direction.\n8. In other words, to determine how far Ian's run covers in calories will require us to determine how much energy he consumes when he runs.\n\n9. Since one calorie of energy is equal to 190 Joules, from step 6, and one Joule equals 1 Newton of force applied to a body in one meter, we can write that one calorie equals 51 calories:\n\n1 cal = 51 cal\n\n10. To determine how much energy Ian consumes while running, we know that it takes 25 Joules to 1 foot, so that means that 5 feet is 125 Joules, and we can write this relationship:\n\n5 feet = 125 J\n\n11. Thus, 1000 feet of running would be 125,000 Joules, and since this relationship applies to each lap, we can apply this to Ian's entire run as well:\n\n5 laps = 16", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "1. There are several ways to find the accumulative total of the sum of the rain that fell in the week.\n2. Let A represent the total quantity of rain that fell in any one given day.

{"text": "1. The question asks us to calculate how much a person paid for a porcelain vase, including base price, sale price, tax payment, and so on.\n2. The first step is to determine the retail price, or the original price before the sale. This is given as $200.\n3. It is then necessary to determine the sale price, or what the porcelain vases sells for after the sale.\n4. We can subtract the sale price from the retail price to get a discount value, or the amount the price was reduced during the sale.\n5. In this case, this discount value is 75% of the retail price, as the sale price was 25% off the original price.\n6. It is then necessary calculate the total sales tax payment. For this, we can use the following formula:\n7. \"10% sales tax\" implies that the person paid 10% of the sale price as tax. If the sale price was 75% of base price, then the total tax payment would be calculated as follows:\n8. Therefore, the total payment received by the person would be $240, making the answer to the question $240.", "answer": " 165"}

DiameterAD (new diameter), is 1.382 cm (1.382cm = sqrt (12\u00b2 + (0.4 * 12)\u00b2)) \nHence, \u0394ABC becomes \u0394ADC with AD = 12 cm. \nFrom here the given surface area is found to be \u03c0 * (D/2)\u00b2 cm\u00b2 or \u03c0, where D is given in centimetres (1.381cm). Hence, total surface area with increasing by 40 percent is 4.77 cm\u00b2. \nHence answer is\n\u03c0 * (1.38 \u00d7 2)  cm\u00b2.   \nSo the final answer 4.77cm\u00b2.\n\nInput: What could \"3\" be the sum of?

{"text": "1) The given problem describes a situation where Jack has $100 and plans to buy four bottles of water, but then his mother calls and asks him to buy twice as much water as he already intended to buy. \n2) Each bottle of water costs $2, meaning that each bottle of water costs twice as much as normal. \n3) After buying the bottles of water, Jack\u2019s mother calls again and asks him to buy double the bottles of water he originally planned to buy. \n4) But then Jack also buys half a pound of extra cheese. Each pound of cheese is $10; therefore, half a pound would be $5. \n5) Each bottle of cheese cost $2, meaning that they cost twice as much as normal which is $5. It is unclear exactly who calls, Jack or his mother. But Jack and his mother have two different values for a pound of cheeses as well, $5 and $10 respectively. Which one is it? \n6) Jack may or may not want to answer the second call, and it\u2019s not clear how long it took him to reach his goal. But Jack does know that his mother has called him and asked him twice for twice as much as what he has already planned to buy. If it takes him twice as long to buy a different item, it will cost him twice as much; if it takes him the same amount of time to buy a different item for twice as much, it will cost him $50. \n7) The cheese costs twice as much as the normal bottles of water, and Jack\u2019s mother wants him to spend half as much the normal price on it. The price of $10 is too expensive for what Jack can afford, $10 is not a good choice. This implies that the cheese is $5 instead of $10, making the total cost of the item (or items?) $120 instead of $100. \n8) Finally, $100 is the only quantity Jack has, so he spends it all. He doesn\u2019t have enough money to buy twice as much again, because his mother asked him to spend twice as much on water as he originally planned on spending. There isn\u2019t any additional money in the end. No matter what he intends to buy next, there isn\u2019t enough", "answer": " 71"}

In the competition, Javier's first throw was twice as far as his second throw, but he threw the javelins 1/2th of the distance on his last throw.\n6. B: On the second throw, he was only throwing half the distance he threw on his third throw.\n7. So, to calculate the distance he threw the javelens on his first throw we substitute our values: \n\n(1050/2 - 525)\n\n8. Subtracting 525 from both sides, since 1050 = 1+2*1/2+2*1/4, we get that he threw the javelen 782.5m on his first throw.

The question asks how youth and the elderly responded to the war. The question does not specify what \"responded\" means, so we have to determine it through context. Youth and the elderly were both affected by the wars, and had different perspectives on what was happening. The elderly would be more focused on the outcome of the war, whereas the youth would be more concerned with how their lives intersected with the war. The question's structure also gives us an indication of the correct answer. Each phrase begins with \"How\", and ends with \"responded\". This structure suggests that \"responded\" should be given multiple answers. This suggests that the correct answer includes plural forms.

If she earns 20% more with the new company than she used to with the previous one, the question asks to estimate how much money she earns in total from both her old and new employers after five months. \n1. We can get from the information provided that Cadence has worked for the new company for five months, before her previous company, for 3 years. \n2. This yields 5 months + 3 years = 5 + 3 = 8 months total. \n3. The first step is to establish how much Cadence used to earn in her first company. \n4. We know from the clue that she used to earn $ 5000 per each month. As she worked for her old employer for 3 years, we can conclude that she earned 3 \u00d7 5000 = $ 15 000 in her first company.\n5. The next step is to determine the additional payment she earns in her new company. \n6. As we know that her new employer pays her 20% more compared to the previous one, we can say that she will receive 1.2 \u00d7 15 066.66 = 18 000 from her new employer.\n7.

This scenario describes the mathematical concept of a linear equation, where Frank bakes 24 cookies per day on the first day, but only 12 the next day. You can think of each day as a new line, and the sum of the lines as two trays.\n4) You can solve this problem by writing it as an algebraic equation and then using the method of elimination to solve for x. To do so, you need to write the expression below and eliminate the variable X:\nx + (2x + x) = (5x + 1)*x\n5) If you cross-multiply and square the first term on the right you get 2 + 4 = 8x and 4*4 = (5*4)*x.\n6) Now, by subtracting one side from the other, you get (2x - 4) = (5*4 - 1)*x.\n7) Continue this process by subtracting the second term again, and you get (2x \u2013 2 \u2013 4) = (11 \u2013 1)*x, which is 11 = 10*x.\n8) Cross-multiplying the left shows (5x \u2013 2)*1 = (10x \u2013 2)*x.\n9) Factorizing the first term shows 5x \u2013 2 = (2x) \u2013 1 which is 5x = 1 + 2x.\n10) Factorizing the left term shows (10x \u20132)*x = (3x)*x, which is just x3.\n11) Solving this we get x = 1 + 3*x.\n12) Substituting the value for x in Frank's initial statement, we have the amount of cookies remaining are 1 + 3*(12*6) or 1 + 3 * 72.\nSo the final equation is 1 +", "answer": " 134"}

{"text": "The question is asking how many students Mr. Sanchez has in his Grade 5 class if 40% of them got a final grade higher than B.\nThere are two methods to solve this problem:\n1. One is using proportions and then simple multiplication. If 40% of Mr. Sanche's Grade 5 students got a grade of B or A. Then, there is a 60% chance that 75% of Mr. Sanchez's class will receive this grade or higher.\n2. The second is using algebra. 75 < 40% < 100 means the percentage of A and B is between 25% and 69%. Which is 55% or 2.55 for the second method.\nMultiply 2.55 with 60 to find the number of B and above students in Mr. Sanchez' class. The answer for the second method of solving this problem is 165 (60 * 2.5 = 15, 15 * 1.5 = 22.5 and 22.5 *1.5 = 34.25 and 20 * 34.2 = 684 > 600).\nSo the final answer for both 2 methods is 165/165.\nSo the total answer is 2.

Based on what she was told, she uses the question along with all the yes and no answers she received to narrow down the answer among only a certain number of options. 3. In order to answer the final question, the player must think critically and use her knowledge of clues she's already been given to decipher the information. 4. The objective of the game is to try and find a particular hidden item or category, among many options, that fit the clues given. 5. There must only be a limited number of answers to the question as the purpose is to narrow down an answer, hence the game is limited to 20 questions. So this problem is a bit like 20 Questions, except the options aren't 20. Instead, there is a number of options called a constant with the value of 1. Therefore, using the first option, we start with only two possible answers that could be the correct answer. 6. Thus, the only possible answers for the first 2 questions are 2.

Each foot contains 12 inches, so in square feet, we have 16 feet. 12 inches, or 16 square feet. \n1. The formula for converting square feet into inches is as follows: square feet/(9 inches per square foot): the total number of inch pieces will be equal to the square feet divided by 9 inches per square foot\n2. One can easily see that a square foot contains 144 square inches. Therefore, 16 square feet will contain 16 x 144 square.\n3. inches. To convert inches into feet, one then multiplies this value by 12 inches per foot. This yields 2016 square inches. 967 square inches per foot, to get the total square feet of fabric.\n4. This equals 2444 square feet.\n5. To calculate the remaining fabric, one then needs to subtract the total size of the two rectangles from the total amount of fabric. It is therefore: 2444 feet. 4 feet, or 2440 square feet.\n6. The remaining fabric is roughly: 4 ft, or 38 x 30 inches, a total of 1 184 inches, or 143 20 580 square inches.\n7. 2016 inches per foot: 143 447 squares feet.\n8.

{"text": "1. The question is about Shawna\u2019s workout goal and how many situps she should do to meet her goal and make up for any missed situps. \n2. In order to solve this question, we have to understand and apply some mathematical concepts. One of these concepts is the concept of \"remaining work\". \n3. The concept of remaining work can be represented mathematically by a function that maps a number to the number of times it has to be multiplied by the original goal (minimum goal) to reach the desired goal.\n4. In this case, \"remaining work\" can be represented by the function f(x) = x / 100\n5. To solve this problem, it's important to find the value of f(x) on Monday and Tuesday. When Monday started, Shawna only had to do 30 situps to meet her goal, so f(x) at the start of Monday is 30.\n6. On Monday, Shawana only did 12 situps so this means that the value of f(X) on Monday is:\n\nf(x) = (12 / 100) = 0.12\n\n7. On Tuesday, Shawana decided to make up for the situps she didn't do on Monday by doing 19 instead of 12 Situps.\n\nf(X) =(19 / 100)= 0.19\n8. This means that f(X) on Tuesday was 0.19 - the number of times you have to do 19 instead of the minimum workout goal (30) to compensate.\n9. To complete her goal number of Situps, Shawna will have to do (30 / 0.19), because that's the number of times she will have to do the minimum workout goal to compensate for what she didn't do.\n10. This gives us a final answer of 151. So, Shawna will have have to do 151 situps to complete her workout goal.\nSo the final output is 151 situphs.\nSo the final solution is 151.", "answer": " 59"}

You could count it as 55 coins. But if you remove the top portion and give it to your friends, it\u2019s 40 coins. The top portion (the portion you removed) was what counted as 55. \nAs long as you don\u2019t remove 15 coins, you will have 32 left (since you have 40 \u2212 15 = 32 coins left). \nThus, if you don\u2019t remove all the coins, you will always have 32 coins in the end, since that\u2019s the leftover amount of coins.

The best methods for gaining control of your emotions include being smart, being calm, and trying to stay centered.\n2.) Option A: \"be smart\"- This is a good start, but it's not the best answer. Yes, it's true that being smart helps with emotional control. But, being smart is just one factor, with many other things that can help with the process.\n3.) Option B: \"be emotional\"- This is not the best answer. This choice implies that there is something wrong with being emotional, which is not the case.

{"text": "Given that Yasna has two books, with one being 180 pages and the other being 100 pages, she must read a certain number of pages each day in order to finish both books in two weeks. In this case, the question can be rewritten as 'If Yasna reads an equal number of page each day, how many pages will she need to read each day to finish both of her books in two weeks? To convert the problem to a word problem, we can substitute the letters n and t for the variables a and b: 180 pages times two weeks = 100 pages times n weeks Where n is the number of pages to be read each day If we substitute a number for n, the formula above is expressed as 180 pages/t pages times 2 weeks/n weeks If we solve for the value of n, the formula above becomes (180 pages/a)/( (100 pages/b)/n) So, the answer is (180 pages)/(100 pages/n) times 2 weeks/b So, the answer is 1.8/100/b times 2 weeks/2 weeks where b is the number of pages each day to read if you wanted to finish both books in 2 weeks.", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "1.  The question is asking how many packs of dishwasher pods Hayes needs to do a full year's worth of laundry.\n\n2. The question gives three pieces of information: Hayes does 3 loads a week, 39 detergent pods are in each pack, and each load uses one pod of detergent.\n\n3. To do a full year' math, one would need to multiply the three weekly loads by 39 pods per load:\n\n\n4. (3 * 39) \u00f7 44 = 38. There are 44 days in a month, so 38 will be needed to get through a full year.\n\n5.  There are 365 days in a year, but if Hayes does one load a day, then he would need to do 365 loads, which amounts to 12,580 pods.  If he does 3 loads a day instead, then there is (365\u00f73) = 121.6 loads a year, which amounts to about 1,331 pods.  But, since he does 3 loads of fresh clothing a week, that would result in about 190 loads a week.  This comes to an estimate of about 960 detergent pods per year.\n\n6. So, we now know 960 is an upper bound on the answer to the question.  The lower bound can be computed by simply counting how many pods are in a pack:\n\n\n7. 960 = 336.4 packs, which is an extremely accurate answer. So, one would conclude that, for a full year, Hayes would need to use about 336.9 packs of deter-gent pods. In this case the answer is very easy and precise to get, so you may be tempted to provide this exact amount.\n8. However, the solution above is more accurate. This is because if a different person asked a similar question, they only provided three pieces of information, but they expected the answer to be 960. Although the answer to the question is 960, the correct answer for another person would be different. So the right answer is D: About 336.", "answer": " 4"}

Edward has three times the number of pairs of shoe than Brian.\nCombining this information, it's clear that if Brian has 22 shoe pairs, this means that Jacob has 11 shoe pairs and Edward has 6 shoe pairs.\nWith this knowledge, we can now figure out the total number of pairs of shoecan the three people have.\nAll we have to know is the number of pairs of Jacob's shoe. Since it is half the number of Edward's shoe, it would mean it is 6.\nNow all we need to find the number of pairs of Edward's shoo. Since it is three times the number of Brian's shoes, that number would be 22.\nLastly, we will need to add the number of shoe pairs that Jacob and Edward have together.\nBy combining the solution, we would say that the number of shoes is simply the total sum of Brian's, Jacob's, and Edward's shoe pairs: 22 + 6 + 22 = 48.\nSince all we know is the total sum of pairs, we can now solve for the number of shoe Brian has by subtracting this number with the number we already know, which is 22. 48 - 22 = 26.\nTherefore, Jacob, Edward, and Brian have a total of 26 pairs of shoes.\nSo the final step is to sum the two variables that we got in the step by step solution.\nIn order to do this, we have to subtract the first equation with the second equation, 48 - 30.48 - 21=5.98, and we get answer as of 5.98 pairs of shoes.

{"text": "Input: When it rains, the 3 holes in the garage rain roof leak water at different rats.  The largest hole leak rate 3 ounces per minute. The medium-sized outlet rate of one-half the large hole leaks, and the smallest hole leaks rate of one-third of the medium-sizing rate.  Input:When 3 holes rain water at a different rates.  The biggest one 3 ounces/min. The middle sized one leaks 0.5 of the big hole, and the smaller one leaks 1/3 of the middle-sized one. The question asks for the combined amount of water that leaks out of the 3 holes over a 2 hours duration.\n1. This question involves an arrangement of 3 different sized holes in the garage that leaks at different rates.\n2. To find the total amount of water leaking out of all 3 holes, one would first need to multiply the amount of water leaking from each hole, then add the 3 total results together.\n3. Option A: \"3 times the area of the largest hole\" is incorrect because the question doesn't specify which hole is the largest; additionally, the amount of water leaked by each hole is not measured by the area of the hole(s); hence, this isn't the correct answer.\n4. Option C:\"the area of the smallest hole\" is incorrect due to the same reason as option A.\n5. Option D:\"the area of the remaining hole(s)\" is incorrect due to the similar reason as options B and C.\n6. Option E: 1 + 2 = 3.\n7. Option F: 3 * 4 = 12.\n8. Thus from the calculations, 3 times the area of medium-sized hole leak rate = 6 ounces, the medium hole leak rate is one-half of the big hole, hence medium-sized hole rate = 3.  Then medium-sized hole leaves an ounce/min, and the smallest hole is 1/3rd of the middle-sizing one, hence tiny hole leaves 2 ounces/min = 1/6th the amount.  Then the total is: 6 + 2 = 8 ounces, or 16 fluid ounces, or one", "answer": " 600"}

However, the problem clearly stated that Stephanie wanted all the decorations to be in multiples of 1 or 2. As such, this can't the be answer.\n\n3) The third option has 96 extra candles. However, this is not correct because 96 is not equal to the total number of candles Stephanie started with. Also, not all the cupcakes would have candles, as she wants half of them to have one and the other half to have two, meaning only half of the 24 cupcates (12) would have candles.\n\n4) The forth option, 72, is clearly incorrect as it does not meet the conditions.\n\n5) The final option: 30 is what she has to begin.

{"text": "1) Let's suppose that in the above problem there are M passengers and B bags.\n2) We can find the volume V of M bags using this formula: V=36 * M.\n3) Also, we can find the tank capacity of M gallons using this formula: T=20 * M.\n4) Therefore, we have two equations and two unknowns:\na=1+(3*M) (for M passengers) which can be simplified to 3.\nb=1+(2*M)) ( for M bags) which can be simplified as 3.\n5) So let's replace these two variables to the following formulas: \nM=3,and T=60\n6) Now to solve the problem of how many gallons of plane does the plane need for 400-miles. We will need to substitute the following formulas:\nM=3, and B=6,\nT=60\n7) Therefore, the answer will be 400+60 = 460 gallons for the total number of gallons for a 40 miles trip.\nSo the final answe is M=(total gallons needed)^/B(# of bags)\nSo the final answay is 460/2 = 230 gallons\nInput: I want to be a successful student, which of the following steps is likely most important for me?

{"text": "The question is asking how many miles a person can swim to run for a certain distance.\nThe first step is to convert the given answer into a mathematical expression. \nThe first part says that Tom swam for 2 hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can say Tom swam 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. \nThe second part is more complicated: Tom runs for half the time, at four times the speed. So he runs for 120 minutes at 4 x 4 = 16 mph. The total of 2 hours can be 2 x 120 = 240 minutes for both swimming and running.\nNow, let\u2019s apply this information to the given question, replacing the values obtained with the given formula above.\nIf Tom ran for 120 x 16 mph = 1920 minutes, substituting the values obtained, we get the answer, which is about 32 miles.\n\nSo the final answer 32 miles\n\nInput: Is there an efficient way to count the number of times a letter occurs in the word \"lion\"?

They are listed below:\n\na) Small children are eating 1/2 omelet each.\nb) Older children are eating 2 omelets each.\nc) Adults and seniors are eating 2 and 1 1/2 olive each respectively.\n\nStep 2: Let's begin. Here's a table of values:\n\nSmall Child Tickets Omelet Consumption\n\nAdult Tickets Omelets Consumed\n\nSenior Tickets Omeal Consumption\n\nNow here's how to work out it.\n\nOur first step is determining 1:1 omelet consumption relationship between child and adult:\n\nadults eat 2 omelets\nsmall children eat 1/2\n\nTherefore, 1 small child = 2 adults, or equivalently, 1/2 small child = 1 adult; this means we can express child consumption in terms of adult consumption as follows:\n\nsmall child consumption = 1/(2 \u00d7 adult consumption)\n\nSo, let's set this formula equal to omelets\n\nomelet consumption = small child consumption/(2 \u00d7 adult consumption)/small child consumption\n\nThe answer to the equation is 12.00 omelets. So, our answer = 12.0 omelets.\n\nStep 3:Now we can use this simple equation to solve for child, senior ticket and also adult ticket.\n\nAnd the answer for small child tickets is 2.6, for senior ticket is 18.5, for adult ticket is 35.0, but for child ticket is 1.5.\n\nFinal Answer is:\n\nWe use this simple equation to get the final answer.\n\n#The answer is 23.1 12.0 35.0 18.5\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the question shown below.\n\n#Input:What is the value given to the variable x?\n#Output:Answer: 2.6455212699e+62\n#Input:How many different 3-digit numbers can you form with the digits", "answer": " 584"}

Then, she later realizes that she no longer likes 50 songs she added previously, which means she now needs to remove them.\nWe can start with her initial state and use mathematical induction to find the number of songs remaining.\n* base case: If the initial state is 500, then the number of songs after one week is 1000.\n* Induction step: If Ayesha starts with X songs and adds 2\u2217X to her mp3 player each time. If she keeps on doing that she would always have (2^{n+1} )/2 ^ n+1 as the maximum number of songs. But it is clear that if 50 songs are removed the number of songs needed to add to be 1050, which is a prime number and hence cannot be divided by 2. \nSo the number of songs needed each week to add 2 to X is X/2, which is the exact same as X/2^n. Therefore, the maximum number of songs is (2^{n+2} )/2^(n+1), which is the same as (2^{n} )/2. \nUsing an arithmetic sequence, we find that (2^{n})/2 equals 10^(n/2)-1. Therefore, using mathematical induction, we find that the total number of songs needed is the sum of 10^(n)/2-1.\nSolving the sum, we find that the number of songs needed is (10+10^3+10^6+10^9)/2 = 33955, \nsince n=15 we get 33961 songs in her mp3 player.\nSo the final Answer is 33956\n\nInput: The question that has been asked was, if (sqrt 2+sqrt2)= sqrt3, the equation that has been supplied must be?

We will represent the number of 'free throws' and the number of 'games' as 'f' and 'g', respectively.\nThe question asks for the number of free throws (f) expected when 'one plays in 80%' of the ('g') games. We can solve these equations using the'modulus' (%) operator (which takes an integer 'g' and gives the corresponding percentage). So, we can represent the'modulus' by 'M':\n\nf = g x M\nFor example, if 'g' = 8, we can represent the modulus as follows:\n80% = 8xM\n\nTo solve for 'M', we then multiply both sides by 8/8:\n8xM = (8/8) x (8xM)\n\n8xM = 8\n\nM = 8\nWe can then find the expected number of free throws (g) given the modulus by simply dividing the 'f' by 8:\n\nf = (8/8)*g\n\nf = g => g = f/8\n\nf = 80% => g = [80%/8]/8\n\ng = 80%/8 = 80/8\n\ng = _9_\n\nTherefore, the expected number of free-throws should be 9 if one is only playing 80% of games.\nSo the final answers is g = 9\n\nInput: What does the abbreviation N/A stand for?

The first thing you should do to solve this problem is to read the question carefully and understand the information it contains.\n2. At football tryouts, the Coach wanted to see who could toss the ball further.\n3. Parker threw the ball approximately 16 yards.\n4. Grant overthrew Parker by 25 percent, implying that his toss was 25% further than Parker's, or 3 yards more.\n5. Kyle threw the ball twice as far as Grant, or 13 yards further.\n6. So how much farther did Kyl throw the football than Parker?\n7. We can make use of the following information to solve this problem:\n- We know that the distance Parker threw the ball is 16 yards. Grant overthrew him by 25%.\n- Therefore, Grant threw the ball 3 yards closer.\n- Kyle overthrew Grant by 2 times, thereby throwing the ball 16+13 = 29 yards.\n- So 25% of 29 is 3 yard distance between Parker and Kyle.\n8. Option A) Parker's toss is only 16 times farther than his. Grant threw it for 3 yards, and Kyle threw it for 3 times as far as Kyl.\n9. This would imply that Parker's ball went 16 times farther. Thus, Option A is not the answer to the stated question.\n10. Option B) Kyle throws it twice the length of Grant's throw is 25% more distant. Kyle throws it from Parker's location.\n11. Therefore, Parker's tossing from farther out is 16+3=19 yards.\n12. Hence, option B is the answer to the stated problem.

If James is selling his car for $16,000, then he is saying it originally cost $2000 and is worth $1600 now.\n\nThis means he's selling his car at an 80% profit.\n\nHis decision to pay 90 percent of the new car's cost is significant because it means he's paying for the full cost of the new car. For example, the original price of the car James bought is $3000 and the car he's trading in is $50,000.\n\nThis means that at 90% of the full cost, he's spending $270,000 instead of $30,033.

{"text": "The problem aims to determine Mike's salary after 5 months. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation process to solve this problem:\nLet's begin with establishing the starting point by stating the original data given:\n  > Mike earned 10X more than Fred 5 months ago, which translates into:  - Mike's salary was ~$10,000 5 months ago \n  > Fred's salary at the time was $1,000\nThe first thing we need to factor in is the increase of 40% in Mike's salary, the amount of change that happened since 5 months ago until now. We can calculate the new salary for Mike using this percentage and the original base.\n  > New Mike salary = Original Mike salary x (1 + 0.4) = 1000 x 0.4 = $400\nNow that we have arrived into the present and we know how much more money has Mike earned over the last 5 months, let\u2019s calculate Fred\u2019s current salary.

And there are two possibilities that they will choose to drink one or two glasses of soda.\n2.1 we can assume one glass of soda. Now for a 17 person, we need 1+ 2+... + 17 = 25 drinks of soda to cover all possibilities. We can add 1 drink of soda and 1 drink of wine to 25 drinks to cover all the possibilities. Then there are 8 people that drink wine alone.\n3. Now add 1+ 2...+ 25 = 65 drinks of wine so the total number of people who are at the gathering is 65.\nTherefore, answer to the given question is :17+8 = 25+25=65.

{"text": "J.M., the length of the sandbox is twice the width. Now to determine the length of the box, we need to know the length of the sand box. So if the length is twice the breadth, then to find the breadth and the length, we can simply make the sides of the sand box equal, say one side is 10ft. Then the length of the box is 20ft. The breadth is 2ft less than 10 ft. Breadth = 10ft - 2ft = 8ft Length = 20ft So breadth = 8ft and length = 20ft. We can now calculate the width. Now to calculate the width, we need to subtract the length from the perimeter (P). P = 30 + 20 + 8 + 8 = 64 ft. Here, width is 64 - 10 = 54 ft.

However, the answer lies in option D.\nD: (8-23) = -$15\nD: (23-8) = -$10\n5: The answer is Option D: -$15, the bookstore earnings minus $15 from each \u201cTop\u201d book. Option D is the only one that fits the criterion of (x - y) = -z.\nSo the final sentence is -15\n\n\nInput:The numbers I need to remember are 25, 46, 49, 66, 68, and 95. Which number should I memorize first? Choices: 1 A: 68 B: 25 C: 95 D: 49 E: 46\nOutput: 1) To determine which number to memorize first, we need to consider the number with the lowest digit, which is 5. In this case, the five of 25 and 49 are not greater than 5.\n(2) As the digits of the rest of the numbers are greater than or equal to 5, then the number with the highest digit should be memorized first, which is 10 for 46 and 68. Therefore, the highest digit in each of these is the one with the digit greater than or equal to the number of the highest digit", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "1.This question is about calculating the expenses and revenue for a high school reunion party.\n2. There are two key steps to this question.\n3. The first step is to calculate the total revenue collected. We know that each attendee paid $100, so there was a total of 50 * 100 = $5000 in revenue collected.\n4. The second step is to subtract the total expenses from the total revenue. If the party cost $500 less to pay for than revenue collected, there were two additional expenses.\n5. There are two choices for 'E' -- it's unclear what exactly 'used to pay for' refers to, as it could mean for the party or the remainder of the revenue collected (since the answer is actually 100 + 100). We can also use 'expenses remaining' instead of to pay for, but this would be technically incorrect use of a preposition.\n6. So, the final answer is E:'$100' + '100' = '200'\n\nInput: What was the distance that each race had run when the athletes started the last lap of the race?

This means that he must be able to do 5 back-to-back reps before he starts doing them with a chair behind him.\n4. He is able to do 5 reps after 5 days.  This means that it will take him 5 days (or 5 weeks) to get to floor pushups (if he keeps training 5 days a week).\n5. If, after he has been doing floor pushups for 5 weeks, he still doesn't feel physically able to do them and he decides that he has trained enough, he will no longer be able to improve his number of push ups.\nSo he decides to start training high elevation ones.\n6. John is training high elevation pushups.  They require more strength and equipment.  So he trains 1/2 of how long he takes to do them as they take twice as long to do with equipment (as the wall push-up only takes 1 second to do whereas the high elevation push-up takes 2 seconds.)\n7.

The woman is going to buy a new mattress from a furniture store with a 10% discount on both the Store A and the Store B's mattresses. However, she can only get enough money for purchasing a mattress at store at A, so she cannot buy a new bed at Store B. The question asks about how much money she saved by purchasing beds at Store A rather than Store B.\nLet's answer it by math computation. \n\nHere is the question's equation:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Money saved } &= \\text{Price of mattress } x \\text{(money saved on mattress) } \\\\\n&= \\text{100 x (10)} \\\\\n&= \\text{(100 x 10)} \\\\\n\\text{Made a total } &= \\text{10 x 10}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe woman is going to purchase a mattress at Store A, which costs $100.

{"text": "We know that when the question says 10 years, they mean 10 years from now. Also, they are adding the numbers of all the ages together to get 45, not just the next one. So, we should solve the questions 10 years on the other side to get the answer. To do so, we use the addition formula for this question.\nSum of ages = current age + future ages\nSum of ages = old age + 10\nSum of ages = 45 + 10\n\nSolution: (10 years = 10 years + 10 years)\nSo we can add the ages and multiply by 10 to get the ages 10 years from the future.\nWe know the ages when we add them together to get the 45. We know the brother's age because we already subtracted the older brother's age from the 45 to get the person's age with the current age.\nCurrent age = 45 - (older brother's age)\nThis equation is a little confusing. But when you break it down, you find the younger brother is already ten years younger than the older brother.\nOlder brother's age - You're age - 10\n\nSubtracting the older brother's time from the 45 gives the younger brother the same time.\nOlder brother\u2019s age - (45 \u2013 ten from before + 1)\nSo adding them together gives us four, making the younger brother four years younger than the older one.\n\nNow, taking the older brother's remaining age as (45 - the younger brother's old age + 1)\nAnd taking the younger brother's age as the older brother's old age - 1.\nNow, with the younger brother's and now with the elder brother's ages added to the 10, we have (10+ (45-yb's age + 1) +yb's age)- (10+ (yb's age - (46 - 1) + 1)\n- (10 + 1).\nNow we know that (45 + 1) = 46\nThus, substituting (46 - 4) in the above equation makes us solve the problem.\nThus, (10", "answer": " 20"}

When the helicopter has traveled across the bridge, what is the distance (in feet) from the helicopter to the dog?\nOutput: The scenario involves a helicopter flying over a bridge across a canyon, with a dog on the bridge. \nThe question asks about the distance between the helicopter and the dog after the helicopter has crossed the bridge.\nOption A, \"a straight line between the two sides,\" is 50 ft. This would only be relevant if the two sides were exactly on the same line as the bridge. The two sides of the canyon are not parallel to the bridge. They are perpendicular to the bridge. Thus, the two sides are on the line from the helicopter's starting position across the bridge to its destination\nOption B, \"a straight line,\" is irrelevant because it is not known which straight line is being referred to. Is the straight line from the helicopters start to its finish position or from the start to its destination, or across the bridge?\nOption D, \"a straight", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "Solution:\n1. There are multiple ways to approach such a problem, however:\n2. We start by setting up the initial conditions for the problem.\n3. Let T (Ten dollars) be Fred's weekly allowance.\n4. Then the variables A (his weekly allowance) and N (number of nights he spent at the movies) can be determined from what we know:\nFred earned $6 by washing the family car. So F - 6 = N is how many days Fred spent away from the movies.\n5. We can set up the solution using these simple equations:\n  A = T - (F \u2013 6)\n  N = F \u2013 (F \u2013 6).\n6. Rearranging, we can then solve for F and N:\nF = N + 6\nF \u2013 6 = N + 6 -T\n\n7. And our answer is F \u2013 6 = T - 14 \n8. There are other methods that could have been used, such as using algebra equations. The point is you need to understand which methods are more accurate or suited to particular problems, and choose the best one to get to the right answer.

Since it is an arithmetic problem, division is not an appropriate operation.\nOption B: This choice does not fit with the context of the question.\nOption C: In this case, the total number of the item is the product of the total number of marbles, frisbees, and deck cards when the person has a certain number of each type. The question does not ask to find the total number of marble, frisbees and deck cards when the total number of each type is specified.\nOption D: It is unclear if the 25 is interpreted as a fraction or division. Also, there is uncertainty as to whether it's applied to each item. There is no specification that a constant is being referred to when using two fifths, so the option cannot be the correct one.\nOption E: The answer is the total of each item when the total number of the type is not specified.\nFrom the context of the question, the answer can be found by adding the total number of frisbees and marbles.\nIncluding the specified amount, the person will have 80 marbles and 60 frisbees.\n80 is an addition problem with both the specified amount of marbles and current total of marbles.\n60 is an addition problem of the specified amount of frisbees to the current total of frisbees. A multiplication operation can also be applied to the problem but is not an addition operation.\nTherefore, option E is the correct answer because 80 + 60 is the total number of marbels and frisbees.

{"text": "To solve this question we multiply the values we got, half by (1/4) and 750, and then add the values we got in the process. Here's how we arrive at that.\nFirst, we have to understand how to deal with 'imaginary' values. 1/4 is a decimal, which is a real number, but half is not. It is not a real number. When it comes to real numbers, it is always better to deal with decimals. Here, we understand the term 'half' as '1/2' which is a decimal number.\nSecond, we deal in multiplication using multiplication tables. 1 x 1/2 is 1/2 which is a decimal number, 1/2 x 1/4 is also a decimal number, but then we deal with 1/4 in terms of whole numbers. 1/4 as a fraction is 4/4 which becomes 1.0, and when multiply 1.0 by 750, we get 750.\nThird, the answer is 150 since 750+1/2*4=750+1+4=150\nSo the final answer using this method is 150\n\nInput:The ratio of the numbers three, and a half, is what?

If at least 70% of the students must pass this course, estimate the percentage of the total students that must get passing grades in this course.\nOutput: The average passing grade would be (100%/100)\u00d7100, or 60. We have that at least 70/100 = 0.7 students need to pass the course. But since they need to average at least 68%, then: (60/100) \u00d7 (0.7) = 0.42 students need to pass each session.\nWe need to find out the percentage of total students that must get a passing grade. The total number of students that would then need to pass each session is: 100% =.42*10. In the next session we need the same 0.42% of students to pass in order to achieve the total 0.42%. After the whole course we end up with (100%*10) = 0.978 students passing each session, or 97.8% out of 100% and overall, or 978 students.\nSo the percentage of total students to complete the course with passing grades is: 978/1000 = 0,98\nSo in the end  the final answer of how many out of 10 total students is required to achieve (70% or 68%) of the passing", "answer": " 12"}

No, the game is not fair because in tic-tac toe it is possible for one player to win by simply getting lucky with their placement of the X and O.\nIII. Tic-tac-toes is a game that you typically play with two players by taking turns. In fact, one player often starts first and places their X on an empty space in the middle row. This game is a game of luck, and it only takes one lucky X to fill all six rows and win. Each player tries to get as many Xs as possible in a row that covers the entire board, and the game ends when a player has five Xs in a row. In an unlucky moment, one player ends up with the Xs spread evenly across three places on the board.\nIV. It doesn't matter how much preparation the players make each move or what strategies they use to win because it is possible for one lucky X to do this. The second player tries to block the player's moves, but if they miss, that player can end the game with five Xs in a line. In this way, it is totally possible for the first player to win by simply lucky moves. This is not fair to the second player because they are not given the same opportunities as their opponent.\nV. Tic-tac toe is a game that depends on the X and O spots on the board.

{"text": "The first step in solving this problem is to identify what items are being combined. In this case, it seems clear that Maddie is combining coffee beans and milk for a particular type of coffee, each of which have been purchased separately.\nThe next step is to identify what amounts of each item are being used in the combination. In this case, a gallon of milk is used, so that would be multiplied by 3, since Maddie has a total of 3 cups of coffee per week (2x2x60 oz = 12 x 0.5 = 6gallons).\nThe coffee beans must be measured into 2 different containers. Beans are sold in bags of 10.5 oz. so there are 20 bags of beans in 1 bag, and 2 bags are used per day, so there would be 40 bags used in 6 days. Multiply that by 4 cups of coffee per bag, and the number obtained is 160 cups of coffee. That makes 160x1.5 = 240 oz. of beans used per week. In other words:\ncoffee beans = 240oz x 10.5oz/bag x 2bags/day = 2500oz beans\n\nAdding all of them up gives $120 for the coffee and $140 for milk, which totals $260.\nSo the final amount is $260.", "answer": " 18"}

Because to be kind can be seen as cruel.\n2. Because to be kind requires cruelty.\n3. Because to be cruel demands kindness.\n4. Because cruelty is often necessary to be kind.\n5. Because to be cruel is sometimes called being kind.\n\nOutput: The phrase \"cruel is to be kind\" is a paradox because of the juxtaposition of the words \"cruel\" and \"kind.\"\nConsider the meaning of the words on their own: The word \"cruel\" suggests that a person is intentionally harmful or unkind.\n\"Kind\" suggests that a person acts with sympathy, consideration, or compassion.\nWhen the phrase \"crueler to be kinder\" is formed, the idea becomes that being unkind can, at times, be necessary in order to be kind.\nAn example of this could be a parent who disciplines their child in a way that hurts or upsets them in order to teach them a lesson, which is intended to help them become a better person.\nThus, \"cruel to kind\" is a parody.", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "To answer the question, consider the information presented-\nIt states that Olga has three stripes per shoe, Rick has one less than Olga, and Hortense has twice as many as Olga.\nWe can evaluate each stripe in turn: \n1. Olga has three strips on each shoe.\n2. Rick has one less than three, or two strips per shoe.\n3. Hortense has twice the number of stripes as Olga, which would make her shoes have four total stripes.\n4. Combining the information, we can deduce that the number of stripes in sum would be: (3 x 2)+(2 x 1)+(1 x 4)+(4 x 2) = 8 + 2 + 8 + 8 = 25 \nTherefore, the total number of stripes on each of their four pairs of shoes is 25.\nSo the final Answer is A: 25\n\nInput: How do you know if a piece of music is in the minor key? Choices: \n A: the third note is flat \n B: the chord progression is minor \n C: the third note is in the fifth position \n D: the chord prologation is the third note\nOutput: Let's review the choices:\n1. Option \"A: the third note is FLAT\". The third note refers to the third note of a chord, not the third note in a scale. A minor chord is three notes long and minor key has two different types of third notes: major and minor, the former sounds more consonant (pleasing). So the note in the minor key can't be flat because it must be Major.\n2. Option \"B: the chord progession is minor. Chord progression refers to a sequence of progressing chords, so it can't be minor because chord progressions follow and lead to different tonality.\n3. Option \"C: the third note is the fifth position. If the third note is the the fifth position it must be in the major key.\n4. Option \"D: the chord prolotion is the third note. The chord prologation must be the third note in the scale, not the third note of a prologation. This is not the case", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": "1. First, simplify the number of pages printed (n). Since James has a total of 42 pages to print, and each page is either crumpled and/or blurred, you can't have every 7th page crumpled and every 3rd page blurred. Therefore, the total number of pages (including crumpled and blurred pages) is actually 42 -1, or 41.\n2. Since no pages are crumpled or are blurred, the total number must be equal to the number of pages that are neither crumple nor blur. Since the total number is 41, and all pages have to be neither crumple nor dull, by simple math, the answer should be 41 - 1 = 40 pages.\nSo the final answers is 41 - 40 = 1\n\nInput: I saw a movie that was supposed to be funny, but I couldn't stop crying. Choices:  A : comedian B : horror C : sad D : tearjerker E : tragedy\nOutput: 1) We can identify 'I' as the subject and'supposed to be funny' as the verb(predicate).\n2) The subject 'I' has 2 clauses namely, I + Verb + Rest.\n3) The subject 'I saw' is a complete sentence, hence 'I saw' can not become a verb.\n4) In a sentence, 'I saw' becomes a PERSON, and not a VERB 'I saw' can't become a verb.\n5) The verb cannot be subject, it is an action word on the verb 'to be'.\n6) To make the sentence a verb, verb 'to be' should be eliminated.\n7) A: comedian(can not be a verb), B: horror(can not be a subject), C: sad(can not be the subject), D: tearjerker(can not be a PERSON) and E: tragedy(can not be the verb)\nThe verb must be 'crying' and the subject must be 'I'.\n8) The correct answer is E: tragedy\nSo the final answer E: tragedy", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "Rick has 130 total cards, and he decides to keep a certain number of them, give 12 cards to 8 friends, and give the remaining cards to his 2 sister.\nThe cards cannot simply be divided equally among all 3 recipients. Rather, the remaining cards need to be distributed among these 3 recipients, with each getting certain number of cards.\nTherefore, 126 cards are left. We know Miguel got 15 cards, and his sisters got 3 each. They need an additional number of cards to make a total of 126 cards. The 130 cards were given firstly to Miguel. The remaining cards after 130 are distributed among 3 recipients (the 2 sisters and Miguel), in the distribution of 15, 12 (to the friends) and 3 (to sisters). So, Miguel must be given 2 cards and his sisters must get 4 cards in total.\nTherefore, each of the sisters got 3/5 of a card, which is 3/26 after simplification. So, each of the sister got 1.15 cards. If we add these 1.15 to 15, we get a total of 16.65 cards. So, Rick gave Miguel 4.35 cards.\nSo the final number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is 4.35", "answer": " 13"}

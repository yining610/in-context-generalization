{"text": "Ann spent a total of $330 buying five pairs of shorts at the given price for $7 each and two pairs of shoes at the given price of $10 each. Her total purchase amount was thus $330.\n\nRationales:\n1. The question does not specify the number of each tops she bought since Ann has already told the whole amount she spent.\n2. The answer is given as a sum, but it only gives parts of the answer and not the whole sum of the answer in dollars.\n3. It is implied in the context of the question that Ann's favorite store was still offering further discount on her purchase, therefore she needs to calculate the cost of each individual top after the discount offer since she was not certain about that.\n4. It should be obvious to the reader that since the question was about the cost of each top after discount from the number of shorts and shoes she bought; they only required Ann's favorite store still offered more discount from their previous $330 discount on her purchase in order to be able to answer the question. This means option A must not be chosen because she already knows that option B is the only option, since the previous question asked about the total purchase amount of Ann in the store.\n5. Since option B only gives the $10 discount off from the tops, the answer she gets is not correct because she needs to subtract $20 from the option B answer. That's why it is only the $10 off offer after her total purchase that should be applied to the question in order to get the correct answer. That is why the option C choice is valid because it gives a $20 discount off the total amount spent by Ann before she went to her favorite store.\n6. Because option C gives the correct discount, option D is invalid even thought it implies a dollar is worth 100 cents. The dollar does not match with the chosen option C so option D does not qualify as a choice. That is why option C is always the correct answer to the question in the above given instruction.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "Grade 5 is a grade level, so it's composed of more elementary levels such as kinder. For this particular answer, the level of the grade is 5, but it's still elementary which means it's more likely to have 50~60 students depending on the school's capacity. Mr. Sanchez should also know that grade 5 students (or 6th graders) must have a final grade of B or higher to progress to Grade 6, and to know that many of them are below B, he would have to check the results of their previous exams and interviews. For this scenario that was given, it's possible there are only 50 students in Grade that year because teachers usually follow the population of each grade level to their class as to have easier teaching strategies.\nThe population of the class can help teachers come up with the possible classroom strategies to aid their students with the lesson/activity they'll do.

{"text": "Answer: B: 2 dollars\nRationale: \n1. The question is worded in an obvious way, in which the questioner asks how much is the difference between what is left after subtracting the 7 dollars and the 18 dollars given to the customer.\n2.  It can be broken down in the following way:\n3. \n`The amount of money Hillary has to take from the profit= 3+7 = 10 `\n\n`The amount of total cash Hillary has = 18 `\n4. As such, the final question becomes calculating the difference `d = 18 - 10` and the answer is \\b$2$\\$.\n5. Therefore the option that best fits the context to answer that question is option B.\n\n### Input :At a flea market today, Hillary sells six crafts for an average of 15 dollars per craft. Five customers buy her crafts, but she ends up selling only 38 dollars worth of crafts. At the end of the day, she makes an extra 6 dollars in tips for an average tip of 36 dollars from all seven customers. Hillary then deposits an extra 8 dollars into her bank account.

Given that the question is clearly worded and that the task is stated at the end, the context of this question is different.\n2. In order to answer this question the student requires previous knowledge of the calculation that relates the volume and the price that is sold per craft (`\\bv = p\\b` ).\n3.  Hillary earns an additional 6$ in tips for the total of 7 customers and makes an extra 8$ deposit to the bank.\n4. Given that all customers pay the average price of 15 per craft, their total payment equals to: \\b$\\b$7\\b`\n5. The total payment with including the bonus and the deposit equals to \\b$83$\\$\n6. Therefore if we subtract the total payment from the \\b$\\b$183$\\b` and divide by the price per craft (15) we would get \\b$6$\\$ dollars and the answer is option", "answer": " 25"}

This could be a math test where a student is giving the minimum number of years they have had to answer a question or this could be a math class where students give the answer.  Students can only assume what the question means and not question the question.\n\nB:\nIf James is at least 40, then he would be at least 59 years old after teaching for another 19 years. So the sum of two teaching for 19 years would result in 50 years combined teaching experience.\n\nC:\nThis question is similar to the question above but the word \"less\" is added making it not exactly the same.

In an oligarchy, a few people have the vote and their votes are more influential on public policies than the votes of other citizens.  The government that a society has says a lot about the kind of people who run for office or gain more power over other people. If the government is primarily democratic, it is more likely that the people are free.  If the government is more of an oligarchy, the people are more likely to have the vote taken away from them.\n\n#### Democracy Or Oligarchy\n\n1.

It does not specify that the remaining crayons must all be of the same shade although that information is present in the previous question.\n2. It also does not specify that the greens and blues need to each be a distinct shade and if the greens and blumes are of the same shade, only three need to be distributed.\n3. An example would be given: three green and one blue crayon are distributed to another party. That does not mean Mary must have all three available; she has four remaining by this. This question then can be answered: 4 remaining.\n\n### Input\nMary has 50 green crayons and there are 5 blue crayons of each shade of blue (1 to 9, inclusive).

Yes, because the question asks if she can buy the book.  $100 - $20 = $80 dollars left, which is definitely enough to buy the $20 book.\n2. The question asks if she will be able to buy it. When asking a question, we want to answer with as few words as possible.   As such, she would still be able to buy it since $100 - $(negative number) = $100.\n\n### Output A: Yes, Alice!\n3. Alice's total cost of the book is her bill ($20), but her total cash on hand is her current balance (+$80). Alice can then do the math and realize that she will have $20 + $100 - ($20 / $100) = $180 + $0.80 = $180.80 after her purchase.\n4.

{"text": "He plans on eating 4/7 pounds per day.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Frank has $4 in change given that he goes on a spree, and the 4/7 in math refers to the 4/7 (one-dollar) coins he has left over after the purchase, which means that Frank has a surplus and the 4/4 (five-dollar) bills were used for buying the peanuts and the 2/2(ten-dollar) bllls were left over. Since they are left overs, they are not used in the following computation for the poundage consumption.\n2. The only thing left is the twenty-dollar bill, and since frank bought the peanuts for a total of $35, he has $31 left. One pound of peanuts costs $3, so he has enough money to buy 11 lbs. of peanuts. From this equation: $31-$3=31-3. If 31-3 is divided by 35, that would be 31-3/35. 31-3 over 4 (to represent his 4/7 left over from his purchase) is the ratio 11 over 14, and 11/14 can be simplified to 11/7. For ease of computation, let us assume that $3 is the same as 7.\n3.

The total number of students in school is 80 according to the input. So first we have to find the total students for Class A.\n2. There are 40% total students in class A.\n3. Therefore the total of class A is 40% ( 40 / 100) of 80\n4. Hence the total students are in Class A =40% ( 80 / 1 ) of 80 = 32 students.\n5. Next, we now have to determine the total students in class B.\n6. We know that class B has 22 students fewer than class A,meaning class A has 32 students while class B has 10. This implies\nthat the total of class B is 10-22 = 32-22 = 10 students.\n7. Next, all we need to do is subtracting the total number of class A from the total number of class B\n7.

If roses and Lillies are part of her total purchase, they must cost 1 part of $5 each and 1 2/3 parts of $10 each. Roses should total 20, while Lilies should be twice as much as the amount of Roses.\n\n### (a) What was the cost of the Roses?\n\nRationales: If Roses cost $5 each, this amount becomes the base in which Lilies must be twice as much as that amount.\n\n### 3. Therefore\n\n(3A) $200 is the amount of $5, and $5 is exactly twice as much as $2.50. This means that Lilies must be 2 2/3 times the cost of Roses, which is $2.50 each. This makes Lilies $7 each, which can then be rounded up to an even $8 each.\n\nThe total cost of Roses and Lilies should then be the multiplication of 20 and 8. This is $160.\n\n### Now if we calculate $5/2 for Roses and get $2.50, we can plug $2.50 into 2.5 * (8/2) for the amount of Lilies. If we plugged in $5, the amount of money would be $2.5 * (2/3 * $5) = $2 * $1.666 or $3.33. We then get $2.333 and not $3.33 because that's where the amount of $5 is rounded to $3.33, so this is where our total cost for $2.33.

And then losing a quart (1/4) of the contents of the drawer would just leave her with the original number of original contents.

To calculate the total time in the gym, we can multiply the number of days she works in the gym with each amount of time she exercises to obtain the total time in gym for that exercise.\n2. In other words, the total time in the boxing gymnasium: the hours worked in the boxing gymnast + the hours spent boxing. Multiplying 3 * (4 / 4) + 4 * (4 / 2) = 14: 14 hours.\n3. So the total time she spends in training gym: 1 hour + 1.5 hours = 2.5 hours.\n4. Therefore we get the answer: 4 * 2 = 8.\n5. 4 + 4 = 8.\n6. 8 (two) is the answer.

This provides an opportunity for self-exploration and self-evaluation of your work. The following example questions are intended to make you think for yourself in terms of what you think is the correct value or what additional requirements do you have in mind for answering this question.\n\n## Below are common mistakes you could make.\nPlease pay attention to which types of mistakes you have made during the task\n\n### Mistake 1:\nInput:What is the perimeter of a square that has an area of 30 cm\u00b2.\n\n### Your answer:\nPerimeter of a square is 4 times its side.\n\nThe perimeter is not 4 times the side, but the perimeter of the square needs to be 4 times the length and width of the square, so the perimeter is 4 times 4 cm which is 16 cm. (Length and width must be multiplied together, not multiplied by the same number.)\n\n### Making a Mistake\n\nThe student gave a possible answer by the perimeter which was wrong. The answer the student gave was that perimeter of a square is four times the length of the square. This made the student write perimeter of square is four times the side.", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "Choices:  A: 3\nB: 2\nC: 9\nD: 4\nE: 1\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. The key insight to this question is that the number of parroads is 3 times that of snakes (3x2=6), so there are 6/8=0.75 snakes for every parrot. Similarly, 2x8=16/8=2 elephants for every snake, and every snake has 5 elephants in total, so every parrot has 10/8=1.25 elephants. So all the monkeys are 10 elephants, and thus all the zebras are 6 elephants, leaving 4 elephants remaining at the zoo.\n\n2. Now there are 4 elephants and 16 zebras, thus the difference in number of monkeys and zebras must be 12.\n\n3. The zebra-monkey number difference is $2 = \\left(\\dfrac{12}{4}\\right)\\times 8$ elephants, or $6/4$ elephants.

{"text": "To solve this problem, I first converted the total number of cars to a fraction. Then, I took the part where the number of cars in the front is a decimal by multiplying the number of cars in front and dividing by 10, this gave me a more accurate answer; which was 0.63 (233 cars). Then, during the play, I would multiply 233 cars by 1 to show that they had increased by 1. Then, I converted that answer to a fraction and got 1.195 to show that they increased 1.19 cars ( 234 cars). Then, I got a new fraction by taking the number in 1 ( 234) and dividing by 0.63 to get the new number for the back cars. This fraction was 379.5, so I rounded off and got 380 cars, which meant that there were a total of 714 cars in the 2 parking lots in 45 minutes.\n\n### Explain Yourself:\nThe process I used was essentially multiplying the number of total cars found in the initial description by 1 to show how those cars (233) increase by 1.

However, when the sum is simple like 19+251, then long division is unnecessary. Instead, I only need to recognize the numbers that are a product. The numbers 2 and 4 are the product of 19 and 251.

{"text": "Answer: B: four gallons of paint\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The problem states that Henrietta is repainting. The question itself is already implying that she needs to paint the house.\n2. She has three bedroom, each with 400 square foot. But the living room also takes 600 square foot so the total area of 4 bedrooms would be 400 + (600 * 3) = 2,400 square foot which is smaller than the area of living room which is 400 + 600 = 1,000.\n3. One gallon of paint can only cover 600 of square foot area, but the living room is 600 foot and the three bedrooms are 400 square each foot, so in total 4,000 square feet which is larger than 1,00 square foot and cannot be fully covered by one gallon of paint.\n4. The word 'but' in the wording of the question indicates that Henrietta has more to do than one gallon can cover the living room. We know that a gallon can only cover 6o0 square foot, so the number must be multiplied by 1,600 (400*4), which is more than 1,0o0, so Henrietta must have four gallons in total, if she needs to paint the 600 square living room and three bedrooms which is larger than 400 and 1,o00 square foot respectively.\n5.

'If Lucy gives Linda $5, then Linda has the same amount of Lucy.'

'If Lucy gives $5, then Lucy has the same amount of Linda.' We can interpret the context as: Lucy's initial money was still the same as Lucy after giving $5 to Linda.

This response is technically correct. It accounts for all of Randy's trees which include coconut and mango trees. However, while it may be a correct answer, it doesn't make a logical statement in answering the math question.\nOption A: \"The total number is 187\". This response does not match the right solution, but it is a logical way to answer the question and correctly states all of Randy' s trees.\nOption E: \"Randy has a total 60 trees - 6 less than half as many as coconut trees.\". The response is a simple expression of the correct answer to the question. While this solution matches option C's answer, it is a response of a correct solution to the question and not a solution to the math question that was given.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe statement of the problem states that Randy has \"more than half as many coconsut trees as mango tress\". It doesn't explicitly say how \"many\". However, it's safe to assume that he has 60, as previously stated. There are some incorrect statements that should be avoided in solving this problem: \n\n```\n(a) There are sevent times as many mangoes as coconut trees.\n\n(b) The total number of trees on Randy\u2019s far is six more than Randy\u2019s number of coconut trees.  \n\n(c) Randy has five more or fewer than half as many coonut trees as he does mango trees.\n```\n\nOption (a) is incorrect because it makes the assumption that the number is multiplied by 1.7 to account for half as many, when the math question asks for an answer that would be", "answer": " 85"}

The additional task, which is understanding where the answer came from, itself is educational and relevant to the process of learning.\n3.

{"text": "Answer: There are a few assumptions that make this problem more difficult than it is. For this reason, we need to assume these to have a proper answer. \n1. Elsa has 440 coins, Amalie has 400 coins\n2. Amalie is going to spend 3/4 of her money to toys\n\nThere are different ways to solve this problem so I'm just trying 2 different ways.\n\n### Method 1\nElsa has 440.\nTherefore her original money would be 440-10\nFor Amalie it was the same deal as she has 400\n\nTo solve for this let's say Amalie spend 3/4 400/7 which is 57.14.\n57.14 is actually not even which is why we take the fraction away until we get a decimal. If you take the decimal away you get 0.5714 from that you can multiply by the original number 400 and subtract from the original 400 then this will give you the difference of what Amalie has left once spending 3/4 her money.\n\nAnswer 480 - 57.12 = 422.88\n\n### Method\n\n400/7 is 57.5 which is not even so if you have a number like this and you make it whole by subtracting 3/4 from this 57.5, you will end with 25 which is what you need to divide for your answer. If you have 250/14 your answer would have been 18 and this time 25/2 would give you 12.5 and if you subtract 3/4 from 25/2 you would get 8.75. By doing these two ways you get the same answers and therefore the other method is not better than the other method thus the correct and the most accurate choice is 1.\n\n### Input\n\nThe total number of students in a class is 80.

{"text": "Response:\nLet *W* be the total number of company employees that don't walk to work.\nGiven these: *W* = *200*. *D*(W) = *60%. W*(W)/ 100% = *4W*. Let *X* be the part that drive to work and *N* be the part that take public transportation.\n*W = X + N + 5W*. From here we can see that *W* and *N* could both use an additional subdivision as the total percent of employees that don't drive to or from work is (W+N)/200=20%, meaning the percentage is more narrow than the options given in the problem. Thus it would be more accurate to divide *W* and *K* respectively. So *W* is further divided into: *1W* and *2W*. \n*X = 3W and N = 5W*\nSubstitute these to rewrite the equation\n*W = 1W + 2W + 3W + 5W*. As we can see, the equation becomes too long. So *W* and *5W* could both subtract an *X* each, meaning they have a total difference of 6W. Substitute this, then we rewrite the equation, thus\n*W = 4W*. Rewrite the equation once more, the last time we will replace **W/5W** with\n\n*W* = *36%.*. The total percentage we got from this is 20%, thus the company has only less than half of their employees who walk, and rests are either public transit or cars. Since we have already found that there 3 less people who walks, there must be **3W*/5W = 6 more people who drive.** Rearrange to make it easier\n*W* = 16%. We get the answer that there are only 16% of the company employees that walk.\n\nTherefore our answer is **A: 16%**.", "answer": " 40"}

If corn takes 40 gallons of water per acre, cotton 20 gallons, and beans the same as corn how much water will each of the 3farms receive?\n\nRationales:\nI first decided to use Cary as the person in charge since it's an unknown person.\nNext I calculated the number of acres for each farmer and then came up with the number of gallons or gallons per acre.\nThen I calculated the percentage of water being allocated for each farmer.\n\nAnswer:\nInput:\nBernard, Bob and Brenda are farmers who need irrigation systems. Bernard grows corn, Bob grows corn, beans and cotton and Brenda grows corn and beans. If corn takes 8 gallons of water per 1 acre and beans takes 1 gallon of water per 1acre. How many gallons does Cary need to give to each farmer so that they all have the same access to water?\n\nDemos:\nInput: Cary is an engineer who manages an irrigation system and there are three farmers who must use it. Bernard grows corn, bob grows corn, cotton beans and Brenda grows corn, and beans. If bernard needs 30 gallons of water to irrigate 2 acres, bob needs 7 gallons for every acre he grows, and Brenda needs one for every 2 acres. If this is given out evenly to each farmer how much water will each farm need?\n\nInput: The student's are learning how to use percentages in an irrigation system. They each get assigned to a specific job. Bernard, bob and Brenda need to figure out how much percentage and the amount of gallons each person would to get. Bernard knows how much he needs and is trying to work", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "Cori's Aunt is 15 years old today.\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen the student was asked how old is her aunt, we have to be careful we are talking about the correct aunt and not something else in the question. The information provided are not that helpful to solve the question we are given. We know the Cori's aunt is one third of her aunt. And at that point we are asked about her aunts age. We first need to know how old Cori's aunts is since one third of her aunts number is one third of what? Aunts age. We then use that information about her aunts to complete the equation we are given. We are then asked about the aunt's current age. The answer is 40 years and one month old.\n\n### Explanation of Solution\n\nThe key insight is that the question is asking how old Cori'll be in 5 years.\n\nFor that we set:\n\n* A = 5 / Y\n* Y = 5\n* auntsAge = (auntsAge + auntsAge)\n\nSubsequent math follows the same pattern where each step builds on the result of the previous step but using the next larger value and the answer from the previous step in the sequence, until an answer of 30 is determined.  Then we re-state the equation to account for the fact that Cori will be 1/3 the age of herself in 5 years. That results in 40+30 to represent aunt's age after 5 years and we then subtract one to account for the fact the question asked about the age today.\n\n## 15.

The number of years the tree takes to grow and eventually bear apple fruits is represented by the length the tree takes to grow. The number, 7, represents the number of years the tree to be full grown. The number 4 is also part of the diagram as it represent the age of the girl at planting. Thus we begin solving the problem by knowing the girl is 4 years old.\n\n#### 2. Solution: The diagram shows there are two periods in which the girl is growing, and this can be seen as one period of tree growth. Thus the tree grows for 7 years (4 to 11 years); in this diagram, the girl ages from 4 to 11, and the tree grows from 4 (the tree's age at planting)to 11 (its age at bearing fruit). Therefore the girl is in her 10th year when the tree bears fruit. But to know how long it takes to bear fruit, she would be in her 16th year since the apple tree takes 7 years to grow.

{"text": "The total number of votes cast was 35\n\n### Why:\nInput: We are told of the contest that \"three times as many people voted\". This implies that three different categories of people are in the contest; however, the question only gives information on two cakes namely, \"unicorn\", \"witch\" and \"dragon\". Therefore, we cannot use three times in the response because it would not make sense for us to infer that a certain number of people voted for the dragon cakes, i.e., only three categories exist.\n\nInput: We are specifically told in the question that \"the number of votes for the Dragon cake was 20 more than the votes for the witch\" which means there was a given number of votes for the unicorn and witch cake. In this case, we must assume that there were 7 people who voted the witch cake since there were 25 more votes for the dragon than cake.\n\nInput: From the question, it says \"The number of votes for the Unicorn cake was 2.5 times as many as the number of votes for \"the witch.\" In other words, there were 2.5 times more votes for \"unicorn\". It is true that for 2.5 times 7= 18 but we already assumed there were 7 people voting for the witch cakes. Thus, we know 18 is not a valid response.\n\nInput: The question says \"the number of votes was 35. As stated, the number of votes for each of the unicorn and the witch cakes were 1.5 times as many, respectively, as the votes for the \"dragon\" cake.

The question gives the pension scheme details, which is also known as details from the scheme's conditions of the service, the final salary, and the person's age when calculating the pension amount.\n2. The question does not ask for a description of how the pension scheme itself works, which is a different thing than how the amount of the pension is calculated in the pension scheme.\n3. Hence, the answer that accurately describes pension scheme itself rather than the details of the scheme can be chosen.\n\n### Answer:A pension scheme based on an employee's final salary is the amount calculated by multiplying their final salary by the number of years of their service.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Final salary is used in calculating the pension because it has something to do with what we have earned from the working period.\n2. The working period or a certain number of working years is used as a basis in how the pension scheme determines an employee's final year's amount, which is calculated as the final salary multiplied by the number of years worked.\n3.

{"text": "### Demonstraion\nInput: We can observe from the question that Santana has 7 brothers and each sibling's birthdays are spread throughout the year. To answer this question, we will first need to identify the total number of presents Santana has to buy in a year. This can be found by considering the monthly birthdays of her siblings and multiplying by the number of presents she purchases each month. For example, if Santana buys one birthday gift for her sibling in March, she'll need to buy 7 birthday presents in a year.  Including Christmas gift, Santana has to buy 35 presents in a year. Next, we can compare this total number with the number of presents she buys in the first half of the previous year. Based on the question statement, Santana buys only 18 presents in the first six months of the year. This shows that Santana still needs to buy an additional 17 presents in the second half of a year.\n\n### Response (2nd Draft)\n## Demonstration\n\nInput: Santana has 7 siblings, each with a birthday in the following months:\n- 3 in March\n- 1 in October\n- 1 in November\n- 2 in December\nWe have to answer the question: how many more presents does Santana have to buy in the 2nd half of the year than in the 1st half?\nWe can see that 35 presents would be bought in one year, and 18 presents would be bought so far. To show the difference between the two we need to work it out.\n\n## Solution\n\nLet's look at Santana's present purchases for February.\nIn February Santana will buy 8- 4 birthdays - (2 in December and 6 other birthdays) +1 Christmas present). So she had to buy 18 presents in February, so far 18 out of 35.\n\nIn March Santana will buy 7 birthdays: (3 in March and 4 birthdays in other months in the 2nd semester (8) ). Adding the 1 Christmas present, so she buys 8 presents in March. So far she has bought 26 presents out of 35, which means that in July she was supposed to buy 9 more birth", "answer": " 8"}

B is better answer.\nRationle:\n1. Adding fractions does not involve any other way than what is given by the calculator,  as it is a type of arithmetic problem. Thus, only answer A is correct. \n2. Choice B is still a mathematical problem, but it has another context. Adding fraction and a calculator are no longer the focal point of the instruction. The students must therefore do something which has relevance to the instruction, hence it is incorrect. \n3. Going to friends house is considered a task, and the instruction already includes this in the question to give students the opportunity make connections with mathematics between homework and real like. Therefore choice B is an incorrect choice.\n### Response\nIn both answers, there is a mathematical error to the given questions because you are supposed to put it as a mixed number and then you add it up.

{"text": "One way to do this is to first find the total number of students in this school, which is 15 students times the number of classrooms or 15 * 15 = 225 students. If we further assume that a student can be only 1 classroom at a given time, the maximum number of students this school can accommodate is 225/30, which means 58 (58 \u00f7 30). This solution is reasonable to a certain extent but it'd be more efficient if we instead divide the number of students by the number of desks (i.e. 225 \u00f7 30 = 7.5) to find out how much more seats are needed and then round up to get the final number of seats required, i.e. (7.5 + 1 = 8) extra seats required. So the answer is 225 x 30 \u00f7 225 = 4 seats in each classroom and 4 x 15 = 60 more seats to be added.

The restaurant can buy 70 large slices of pizza for all of the people.\n\n## 4.9.2 Input/Output Examples:\n\n### Input 1: A company has 40 engineers and 20 programmers available to finish an assignment. Unfortunately, 60% of the engineers are on holiday or sick. So only 1.3 times the number of programmers as engineers are available. How many programmers are available?\n### Response 1: 22 is available.\n### Demo 1: The question includes a set of employees (engineers, programmers). It also includes the work (holiday or sickness) to be done for their roles. The question has a ratio of 1: 1.3 in total. There are 2000 total jobs available and only 77 percent (4000) are free. If the question assumes that people are available for both jobs (engineers and programmers), all 200 are available as 5000 are free. If we only consider engineers, there are 80 (2000 * 50%) available. If we only consider programmers, the answer is 22 (80 * 50% + 77 percent). The question, however, refers to only programmers. Because 50% of engineers cannot work on engineering and 60% of engineers must be used for programmers as a result, 50% * engineers * 60% must be subtracted from 0.3 * programmers.", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "Input: Ludwig works 7 days a weak and he usually works half the day during friday, saturday, and sunday. If his daily salury is 10 dollars, how much does he eanery week?\nDemonstration:\n1. The question makes it clear that the answer requires a calculation with one variable.\n2. Since the question involves two periods (7 days and two different parts of a day) it requires some basic knowledge about number of days in a week (7), number of hours in day (24), and amount Ludwig normally earns for one day which is$10.\n3. Since the question involves one variable, then we're only concerned about one variable which is number of days Ludwig works\n4. We have to find the equivalent of his earnings per day in a week by multiplying his earnings with the number of days he works in a week, in this case 40 days.\n5. The question doesn't provide any additional information about how Ludwig earns his salary. Let's assume that it's a fixed salary of $10.\n6. Therefore, we will calculate the final amount he earns by multiplying $10 with 40, which will give us the answer in the form of dollars which is option B and that will be our answer.\n7. The solution for the question is B: is the answer in the form or dollars since, the question doesn't specify the number of hours Ludwig works. the answer is in the form dollars meaning his salary for his weekly time is $400.\nAnswer: B: is the amount in the form of dollars.", "answer": " 55"}

She has $26 and wants to buy the wallet with it. She has been saving for a half of a year. Answer the following grade math question with no less than 20 words.\n\nA: Preparing the work\n\n1. We need to calculate how much more money Betty needs in order to buy the wallet she wants.\n2. To calculate that we should divide the total cost by total saved money and then add 12.\n\nRationales: In the given context, we need to give student's the answer to the question and the example is one of the ways that they can support that answer.\n\n3. Firstly, we should find out how much Betty has saved so far.\n\n```\n       $26+$0.5*$100=26.5\n```\n\n4. Since she has 26.5$ already, the total price will be 173.5$.\n5. As she only has half of what she needs, she needs to save 173.\n6. We should multiply 173. by 2 because she has 2 different people contributing to her savings.\n7. After we do that we get 346$.\n8. Finally, we should simply add 12.

There is only one Anne in the class.\n\nBy assuming that Anne is part of the class, a correct calculation can be made.

What age will Mel be?\n\n  **Answer:** Ages Katherine: 16, and Mel: 9.\n  **Explanation:** In order to extract the answer we first need to divide a range into the left, the middle, and the right, in this case the range will be 0: 16, so since the left part of the range is 0, we then 16 less will give us 6, 6 + the right will give us 16 + 3, 16 + 19 = 35, 35 + 3 = 38 years. \n\nThis method of solving problems can not be applied to all problems, but it can be used in simple and direct problems like this, but it is necessary to know all values \u200b\u200bin the range because it is not necessary to go out of the range to reach the answer at some point, so the values \u200b\u200bare like 6 months, 24 hours, 8 years etc.\n\n  *Example 2:* Input: There are 75 students in a class, and each student has seven siblings.

{"text": "The two conditions are that Glenn goes to the theater on Wednesdays and Saturday, thus he spends $5 (whenever Wednesday is) plus $10 (if it's a Saturday) totaling $15.\n\n### Input#2: Glenn pays $7 for a ticket to the baseball game. He also buys a program that costs $5, a water that costs $3, and two hot dogs that cost $1 each. How much did his total cost?\n### Response#2: Let the variables be as follows y = total cost of Glenn's dinner; x = baseball ticket cost; z = program cost; w = water cost; a = hot dog 1 cost; b = hot dog 2 cost;\nThen the equation for total cost = y + x + Z + w + a + b\nIf y = total cost, the two equations above can be subtracted to reveal 7x - 7z - 5w - 2a - b = y. I then isolate variables b, w and x to obtain - 7z + 5w + a = b and then simplify the variables x and w to obtain x = 3 and w = 5\nThen plug in the variables z = 7, w = 5 and a = 2, we get y = 15\nAnswer: C:  $15\n\n### Input:#3: A school principal wants each student to bring in either $1 for field trips or $3 for music supplies.

{"text": "The total is equal to 1000 cents, or in a different way you can say 100.00 cents (ten dollars), because 10 hours equals 100 minutes which equals 100 \u00d7 5 cents = 500 cents and 1000/500 = 2 so multiplying 1000 by 2 is equal to 1,000 cents. \n\n\n### Explanation:\nRationales:\n1. Ayla is the manager, whose responsibility is to hear complaints.\n2. Her responsibilities to manage 50 customers a month is not very clear as we need know the number of phone calls the customers make with each phone call.\n3. How to manage complaints and how many complaints we hear is also unclear.\n4. It seems that her job requires her to speak to customers for one hour, the minimum time which each customer is allowed to speak, and that each phone call is worth five cents, the lowest cost to speak with customers.\n5. With those information, if she talks to 50 customers, that customer calls for at least 1 hour each (50 \u00d7 1 = 50), and each customer call is 5 cents, that is to say that her bill is 50 \u00d7 100 cents = 5,000 c as well as 5000/5 = 1,00 c\n\n### Input : You have three tasks at home.

{"text": "Mabel has 85 + 12 more marble than Amanda. Thus Mabel has 97 more marbles that Amanda.\n\n### Explanation\n- Amanda needs 12 marbles to have twice the amount of marbles that Katrina has which is 16 marbles.\n- Mabel has 5 more times the marbles than Katrina, therefore we can assume that Mabel has 95 marbles.\n- Both these facts we use to fill in blanks in the question: A: Mabel has how many more marbles than Amanda? B: Answer is: 95 + 12 = 107 marbles\n\n### Assessment:\n1. The answer should be:  Mabel has 96 marbles more than Amanda. Note that Amanda will get 12 more than Katrina and Mabel will get 95 more than Katrina.\n2. The answer should be (noted that the question asked for the number of marbles and not the amount of marbles). The way we got this answer is by making an equation that has the two answers of the marbles (we took the number of marbles of Amanda and one of Katrina then took the number of the answer and we did the same for Mabel and for Katrina but we just switched the number we got with the previous one). The equation we got is: Mabel_m_amanda = Mabel _m_5 (96+12=104)\n3. An alternative approach could be to ask: 'How many marbles does Mabel need to have twice the amount that Katrina has?' Answer: (Mabel_m_2(Katrina) = (Mabel_m/5). Therefore Mabel has 103 marbles.\n4. Another approach could be to use the second table we provided, but this time to subtract what Katrina has from what Amanda has for Mabel. This would be: Mabel _m-_ (Katrina+amanda)= 85 (85 - 16=75)\n5. These different approaches all get the correct answer that Katrina needs.

(2) there were 8 boys and the same number of girls. (3) There were 8 boys and 8 girls on the day of the fieldtrip. (4) Some of the girls could not go to the field trip. Therefore this means that there are either more girls or fewer girls in the minibus.\nIn other words, the minibus had either 14 (18-4) or 16 (18-2) girls on the day of field trip.\nSince the minibus had a total of 18 students but we know there were 16 of them (including 1 for driver), it means 4 girls were left out of the bus. Thus 4 girls could not go to fieldtrip.\n* _B_: If there were 8 boys, this means there were 10 girls. From the same reason as A, we can conclude that either there is 16 or 14 girls in the total. Thus we can conclude there are either 10 (16-6) or 12 (14-2) girls. Since there are less girls, the answer to the question is _B_.\n* _C_: if there were 8 boys on the field trip, that means there are 4 extra girls. We can conclude from the same reason as A and B that there must be either 6 (4-3) extra or 4 (4-0) extra girls.

The question gives the number of times Valerie can skip and it is 80 times a minutes, therefore V = 80.\n* 3. Substitute V = 80 in the formula which becomes R - (80/4200) x 15 which represents the number of total skips if they do for fifteen minutes straight.\n* 4.

{"text": "Rationales: Answer: 375 pounds:\n- The task refers to three individuals in all, thus three responses.\n- Stan weighs 5 pounds more and 5 pounds are 32 ounces and in lbs, that is 4.5 lbs. therefore 'Stan weighs  5 pounds more than Steve (5x4.5lbs).\n- Steve is 8 pounds less than Jim.\n- 8 pounds equal to (8x4.5lbfs).\n- Jim weighs 8x4.5 lbs is equal to 38 lbs. (38 lbs x 3= 114 lbs).\n- therefore the total weight equals (114 lbs x3)=375 lbs.\n\n### Input:\"What do you think is the most important thing to learn in history?\"\n\n### Demaration:\nAnswer.\n- The question refers to a particular subject and not in a specific discipline, but from students who are supposed to be experts.\n- Thus it is most efficient to consult students, in person or virtually, and collect their opinions or suggestions, thus they get a chance to exercise their opinions.\n- By conducting focus groups, teachers are not only able to address the question appropriately but also learn about student views, opinions, and perceptions.\n- They can use the data collected to adjust their plans or strategies.\n\n### Rationales: Answer: A: A good teacher.\n- Students need to learn how to learn. (Diana Hess; Teaching and the Opposite of Forgetting and Richard Felder; Why we forget most of what we learn.\n- This helps eliminate poor teaching practices, where information is repeated excessively without a deep understanding of the topic, thus wasting students' time.\n\n### Another answer:\n- Students should learn how to read, analyze books, and write in a way with enough depth and skill so that they can think more critically about important issues in our world. For example, reading a book well on the Holocaust in Europe or racism in America will help the students learn more about how history influences human civilization and be able to better understand their current circumstances than they would otherwise.", "answer": " 319"}
{"text": "### Demostration:\n1. This is a very confusing question.  Ian starts the jogging route, then the question asks about how much he burned when he jogged it 5 times.  But then the answer is how much he burned after doing it five times.\n2. The question makes no sense because of these discrepancies.  It needs more work.\n3. Then at the end the question becomes, \"How many times did Ian jog?\"  That answer is 5 laps.  So the question could either be restated, or this answer is incorrect but not clearly shown.  There is no hint in the question why he should burn 500 calories, he could have 729 instead if he jogged 13 times because of the difference between 100 feet and 3329 feet.\n\n### Answer:B: evaluate progress\n\n### Why:\nWhen solving the question the answer that is obvious is 500 cals but this was just an easy answer as I did it. But the real answer is he has to go 250 feet in each lap so he would need to run 2500 feet to get 1000 calbs so he would run 125 laps.

So this means Tish bought everything for $216.00 but she bought the stuffed animals and the horseshoe magnet for $4.50 the horseshoe magnet cost 3 times of the sticker where as Stuffed animals cost a quarter of the horsehoe magnet. So Option A (the horseshoe magnet costed 3 times Stuffed animals and $2.50 in total).  3 times 2.75 would be\n 6.25 then you subtract 2.5 from 6.25. 6.25 - 2.5  =4.75 So the answer to How Much, in dollars, did the magnet cost?

{"text": "### Input/Output\n\nResponse:\n\n### Demands:\n\n### Justification:\n\nFederal guideline recommendations are a bit obscure. The writer does not provide any explanation for how many cups is recommended per day. So that, I would interpret the question as asking for information on how much a person should eat that would meet their goals over five days instead of a single day. The guidelines specify at least two cups. The writer did not state the recommended quantity other than through the implication of the sentence structure.\n\nIt is also possible that the wording of the question is inaccurate and that the guidelines are simply recommending eating at least two cups a day for every meal from breakfast to dinner (8 cups a day). Given that the author did not specify that 'per day' needed to be interpreted correctly, I decided to use the second interpretation by interpreting each meal as an equivalent to a single day's quantity. This makes the question easier to answer by setting the initial condition that the total daily amount of vegetables eaten equals 8 cups (4 times 2 cups). The daily minimum amount of vegetables to be eaten in order to meet the goal (assuming 8 cups of vegetables was eaten daily) would only need to be specified as the difference between the amount of vegetables eater compared to the goal amount. The writer did not stipulate a number to this and it would be up to the student to determine which number is correct for Sarah to satisfy her goal.\n\nThe first answer was calculated as (2 cups - 8 cups) / total = 2 / 8 =.25 cups per day. However, considering that breakfast is eaten first and lunch is eaten fourth, we already know the first and fourth (and potentially second and third) meal will be lesser than the goal when using these stipulations. Using this information, we can reduce the minimum daily amount by determining the amount of extra vegetable that should have been eaten to satisfy the requirement if breakfast and lunch would already be included in the day's intake. With this reduction in requirements, Sarah needs to eat 7 cups of vegetables to meet the minimum daily requirement. The first answer did not specify the correct number of cups necessary to meet Sarah's goal. An additional", "answer": " 3"}

The question asks two questions: how much does she have to save each month during each month so that it adds up to $150 at the end of the year?\n3. It does not ask for an answer for each month (except for the first)\n4.

The question asks to find x?\n2. The question is structured like this: the question asks you to find x from a known set of inputs and outputs.\n3. An answer of 3 is given by adding up the inputs 3^2 and multiplying by x to find the answer.\n4.. x=3 has been shown.\n5. Hence, the answer is x=3.\n6. x=5 has no mathematical merit at that point, because it adds up to 3.\n7. An answer of x=5 is given if the question was asking for a value to be entered into one of several answers, which is not the case at that point in time, \n8.

Option C might be more of an option if it wasn't about 360\u00b0 degrees.

{"text": "This is a fairly straight forward problem but there's more to it that meets the eye.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nUnique has dough that measure 12inches by 12inches. This means there are 144 square inches in all for her square biscuits. Unique has enough dough to make 1 biscuit for every inch. She is now wondering how many biscuits she can make from her available 144 inch piece of dough. Since Unique likes biscuits, she might wanna get more biscuits than she needs.\n\nA good start would be to set up a double-row square matrix with all the rows and columns, filling in whatever we don't know with 0s. The total number of biscuits, 24, needs to be in the column for the number of dough pieces, 12. So we start at row 1 and put a 1 there, and keep going until column 12. When we get to column 12, we have the total number of biscups, 24. The only question is how many rows should we go with, and that's gonna depend on the answer for that column.\n\n![Diagram 1](./assets/readings-v1-instruction1-biscuits.jpg)\n### Final Solution:\nSince there's a total of 24 biscuits in the column for the biscuits available, there needs to be 144 - 24 = 120 total squares in this matrix. Since the total number of rows is twice the number of columns, that means we have 24 squares in each row, so we have 120 divided by 24, which is 5. So we need to enter 5 in the first row, which is equivalent to having 1/5th of all the squares. We can then enter a 5 in the next row, and so on until we enter a 1 for the last row.\n\n![Diagrams 2](./assets/readlings-v1-biscuits_solution2.jpg)", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "Answer: D: 165\nThis is the answer to the above question. But we will only be giving a rough explanation of it. So let's give a rough explanation of how it's reached.\nI took a rough shot first thinking 2/3 * 2000 = 2666. The first part refers the bear feasts on the second part refers the acorn. That's not the answer. Rather let's assume we had to get another 333 pounds out of acorn. We know that the bear gained 2000 pounds. That's the total weight. We know that we already had 2000 more pounds from the first option. That's 4000. So how are we getting another 333 from acorn? Well the problem asks, salmon makes up half of what's remaining. That is, salmon should add up to half of what is left. 20% is out of 4233 remaining weight. Divide by 20 and you get the remaining 4233/20 = 211.5. That is to say, 20% of what remains is approximately half (the exact 36% might be rounded off to 40% in the real world due to errors, but no one is going to question that because it's close enough. That's why.) To find half of about 210.5 is simply 105.25. Round it to 104, 103, 102, 101... and then you find the round off point. The one that makes the most sense and you know why I started with 4000, because we already knew that the acorn made up half of what the bears got from the small woodland animals. It's just that I am not comfortable solving the question via such complicated explanation when I could have started with what's already known and ended with the answer.

Since every worker is working only 8 hours a day, that means that if all $16 are saved in each of these 8 hours, we would have $128 of savings a day. This $128 a day was divided amongst all existing workers that year, which means they are saving $1 a day each. Now, if each worker works 5 days a week, that means they are saving $5 per week each.

How many beads in each part?\", so the question is about the beads in each part,and the answer is 6 blue, 0 red, and 6 yellow.\n\n2: This question could be answered by removing n beads from one part and adding twice n beads to another part, and removing again n beads and adding again n beads, after several times, the beads in each are equal.\n\nAnswer: 6 blue, 15 yellow, and 0 Red.\n\n### Input :\n\nSay the girl has 6 blue, yellow, Red beads.\n\n**32** \n\n### Rationale:\n\nIn the original problem, the girl had 6 blue, 8 yellow, and 6 red beads. After she divided the total into three equal number of beads, she now has 6 blue beads, 16 yellow bead,0 red beads. After twice she divieded the number she originally had, she now has 12 blue beads, 24 yellow beads and 12 red beads. Then she subtracted her original number, 12 blue bead, 8 yellow bead, and 6 red, leaving her with 6 blue, 3 yellow and 12 red ( 12-8-6).

The girl divides the total into equal parts, so she ends up with 6 blue beads in one part, 10 yellow beads in another part, and 0 red.

Then he bought bread and juice which both weigh 8 kg. Then he walked back home which is 4 miles. So then he walked back home for 4 miles but carrying a total weight of 8 kg.

{"text": "This is a great example of including examples to provide further clarity on the question. The question asks for the amount of money John needs to earn to reach the goal/target. The first step when solving this is writing out a number line, and the first entry on that number line should be $18 (since that is what the initial amount is). It is useful to include one example, and this could be $20 from the previous week which he did not earn. Since he only manages to earn half that, he should earn $10, because that is half of $20, or $18 (his first amount). To figure out the additional amounts that he should earn, the next step is to take away those two amounts from the desired amount, which in this case is $60. What is left is a multiple of $60/54, thus we multiply by 54/60 to get $3. Therefore John would have to earn $18 + $10 + $3 = $31.

Given that Jim has no model of a Ford and he has 222 Buick models, we can create a table of model names and counts where the number of Buick = 216. 2. The table below demonstrates the number of Ford models Jim collects. Ford Total = 32\n\n|Model|Count| \n|----|----| \n|Ford|32|\n\n### 2.

For the first five recipes she chooses, she needs five cups of flour and six cups of sugar, and the recipes should make one cake. Torri wants to choose exactly 11 different recipe books for the potluck, but the ingredients from one recipe could be used in more than one cake (the recipe could call for five cups of flours, but that could be used to make five different cakes.) In addition, the recipes must be chosen from five books, and the book with the most recipes must be used. How many different recipes from the 5 books can she make, and how many different cakes will that make?\n\nTherefore I needed to create 3 different cakes for 5 different books and used 11 cakes that made a total of 6 different recipes\n\nSo:\n\n1. I started with number of books that had 5 recipe books = 11\n2. Find ways that would make 11 different cakes and used a different recipe from 5 book\n3. I used the first five recipes from five books to make 1 cake, I used the first five from each one, that would mean = 55\n4. the next five recipes from five different books make a second cake so it would be a 55, I did this for the rest of my cakes\n5. I would have a total of 5+5+10+10+15=4?5)\n\nSo I had 45 recipes and made 11+11+11=33 cakes\nand I can use the same recipes to make 11 different recipes for all 5 books\n\nComment: Please [edit] your initial question to limit it to a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer.\n\nComment: You can ask as many questions as you want.

{"text": "I am an employee at this company and I need to determine how much longer my trip would be if all the stoplights were red. The equation to find the length of the first route without the stoplights is 14 minutes+ the total amount of stoplight time we take. The equation to find what the total light time is is total light time = 3 stoplights multiplied by 3+ the light red time. The equation to find just the red time is multiply the red time by the three stoplights we will take. The equation to then find the length of the route with an extra stoplight is 14 minutes = red time+ light time.  If all the stoplights are red total light time = total red time.  Therefore the equation to find the length with three stoplights being red is 14 minutes + 3 * red time - Light time.  The total light time is (3 * stoplight green time) + (-2 * stoplight red time (the last two lights))\n\n### Output:18 minutes\n\n### Reasons:\nThe output was 18 minutes.

The cost of the best selling book is $8 and the cost of the least selling book is $23.\n\nNow we need to find how much was sold of each type of book.

My guess is that the hotel has a rule that pets aren't allowed on the shuttle to the ocean. You don't want to risk breaking that rule. It might cause some inconvenience, but it's worth taking precautions, so I'll ask them if they allow pets on the shuffles when I book my room. If I have to leave my dog behind the hotel for the day, I'll think about walking it before we go out, or asking my neighbors to dog-sit while I'm away. But if I don't have any other options, I can always take them to the pet store.'\n\nThe sentence is very short and not fully punctuated.

However, you can't take any pets on the shuffle. My guess is that hotel has a shuttle rule that it does not want you to take pets on the ocean.

{"text": "The cheetah is 210 feet away from the gazelle initially, which means that at the cheetah's maximum speed of 60 miles per hour, it would run about 6.5 miles and take up to 126.6 seconds to reach the gazelle. On the other hand, if the gazelle is also running at its maximum speed of 40 miles per second, it would take up to 42.7 seconds for the gazelle to run 8.5 miles.\n\nSince the cheetah travels 6.5 miles in only a maximum of 126.5 seconds and the gazelle travels 8.5 miles in the same time span, it would not take the cheetah long enough (42.7 seconds) or as long as the cheetah (126.6) to catch up from that distance.\n\nAnswer:A cheetah is at the position S, and gazelle is at the position S. This means that the distance between S and G is 210ft.\n\nCheetah can travel at maximum speed of 67 mph and therefore travels a distance of S-200ft at a speed of 67mph, in 126 seconds.

It is not intended to teach the method but to provide the most basic examples and provide insight as to what problems will be solved with this method. \n\nThe taxes wash out as a monthly contribution. Angie is left with $18 extra dollars each month. She must have contributed and receive these $18 in monthly taxes each month. To solve for the taxes, one must multiply the $80 by 12 months per year and divide the total ($ 960) by the number of years of contributions ($16). The result is $8.33 per year in taxes. The monthly taxes, therefore, is $2 (0.017) per day.\n\nThis is not an exercise to teach the method, but to show the simplicity with which this can be done.\n\nExample 1: The correct answer with this method is answer 3, but the answer in the book is answer 2. The only difference is that in this case, the last month of payment of taxes has been carried over to this month, creating a greater disparity in the cash balance, and making the average contribution smaller than the book answer. If we subtract the total in the last month from the total in this month, $18, the answer would be (42 - (18)) / 12 = 3.33\n\n#### Response 2: This exercise has been given to a person without knowledge of algebra or this method.

{"text": "There are two possible ways of solving this problem.\nThe first option is to multiply 8 feet with 250 feet, and divide this result with 6 feet left. This yields 250,000/6, or $41,666.66.\nThe second option is first to find the price of the metal roofing per foot by dividing the $8 cost of the roofing with 250 of free roofings per bundle, and then multiply the $8 price per foot with 6 feet of roofing. (250/250) * 6 = $80 + $48 (250 / 250 - 3) = $128.\nThe second option provides a way of finding the price by using two operations (division and multiplication) in one step.\nThe first approach uses division but also requires the use of several formulas.\nFor the second option only division is used because the price of metal roofing is $8 per foot, and the price of roofing left is found by just subtracting the number of roofing which was free out of 250 roofings the supplier brought (250 - 200 = $50, and $50 = $48)\nThe second option can be done by multiplying 250 by 8 to give $2000, subtracting the product that was free ($48), and then finding the remainder by subtracting ($2000 - $48 = $1952) divided by 6 = $325.4.\nMr. Caiden will have 325 feet left to pay for.\nMr. Caidan will spend $325.\n\nAnswer: Divide the total price with the free price and find the remainder.

{"text": "Answer: 18 dollars\n\n### Explanation: The student is given a question that requires them to know how to do division and to be able to estimate. The student is asked to find the amount left after the money is spent. The amount left if $51. First, the student needs to decide how she spent the money. She spent half of it. So, there was half of the original amount remaining (because the student spent half of it.) To answer the question, what was the original amount, the student needs to find half the original amount (half of half is a quarter, since each half is half the whole). That means there has to be one quarter of the original amount. In order to get that, the student needs to do division with the remaining amount (half of that left.) In the question, $25 was given as half the original amount. Therefore to find the dollar amount left, the student needs to divide $25 by 2. The amount left is $12.50. Because the student spent half the amount of whatever she spend, the student needs to spend half of what she spent. That's $12.5, which was half her original amount. If the student spends the same amount again, she will have half of that amount ($12.5) left. If she spent one dollar more than that amount, she would spend $13.\n\n### Input:(Rewrite to a number sentence). A line with a slope of 2 passes through (3,4) and (8,9).

Finally the student can take the coefficient of x (the constant), the slope, and the two equations resulting to their equation, 10-10 + (2) (9-2x) =10+11-8-1.

Option A is false for multiple reasons. First, option A is only correct if the shop offers three models of smartphones of varying prices (let's call them A, B, and C). There is no way of telling whether the shop offers multiple phones of varying prices. Even if there was, the price does not depend on these variable prices and thus option A remains incorrect.\n2. Option B is wrong for the same principle as option A. There is no way of knowing whether the prices for each product increases linearly with its category. If the phone is more expensive than a computer, and the phone is more expensive a tablet, then the statement does not hold true.\n3. Option C is also incorrect. There are many different ways the price of these three products could be calculated. For instance, suppose computer and phone prices were set to $500, and we still have to add the cost of a tablet to the equation. Even in this case, how do we calculate how much it costs for a computer and phone? We could say that adding the prices for these two together equals the price of a tablet plus the price of a computer plus the price of a phone, and if we follow these rules, it is not possible to determine an answer for any situation where a phone and computer are both present. It would be even more confusing if an advanced tablet existed - what if the price of this device was $800? In this case, how could we determine its cost in terms of the other two devices?\n4. Finally, option D is the correct choice. In fact, all three calculations in options A-C would equal the price of three smartphones, one personal computer, and one advanced tablet. There is no way to simplify these mathematical equations into any simpler form nor does it matter what the variable price for each product is.

The second part is written from the narrator's point of view. In the third part, you become the narrator. Write each part using narrative point of view or omniscient. Choices: narrative point of view omniscient\nRationales: Choices:\n\n1. NP tells a story from its own point of view.\n2. O tells a story from every possible perspective.\n3. It does not make any sense to write the story from Barton's perspective in the first place, as the story is already fictive.\n4. In addition, Barton's perspective cannot be more than one other person's perspective (narrative point of view), as he is not the storyteller.\n5. Hence the answer that fits the requirements is omniscient, which is the only other way to tell the story.\nAnswer: omniscient\n\n### Instructor Reaction:\nAnswers (narrative point view) is not what I expect students to write here. I was expecting something broader and deeper.

The question also states that expenses for 25 consecutive days have to be within 7%, this means that there hasn't been any amount ever exceeding 7% of the total income.

{"text": "Sorry! I could not understand this task, could you please clarify it?  \n\n### Answer\nThe instruction implies that Lake Crystal has twenty percent less frogs than Lassy Lake.\nThis statement implies that Lassy Lake would have two-time more frogs than Lake Crystal.\n\n20% less means divide a percent into the total number and multiply the remainder with 100. For example, if the total number were 100, the step would be 100% - 20% * 100 = 80. The final result being that 80% of the total.\n\nThis is the basic concept of what the instruction implies.\n\nIn order to complete the task, a student would need the correct answer. The correct answer is 35, with the formula being\n\ntotal (number of frogs) = (total (Lassy Lake) / (total (Lake Crystal) * 200%)\n\nWhere (total (Lassi Lake) = 45, total (Crystal Lake) = 15\n\nIf a student was presented with this question for the first time, he probably would use the following formula:\n\ntotal (number frogs) = (number of frogs in Lake Crystal) * (total Lassi Lake / total Lake Crystal)\n\nThis answer was given to students based on a question given to them on the day of the test:\nHow many more frogs are in Lake Crystal as compared to the total number of frogs in Lake Lassi?\n\nThe formula would then be\n\ntotal (# frogs in Lake Crystla) - (total (# frogs Lake Lassi), where total (# frogs in Crystal Lake) would be assumed to be 15.

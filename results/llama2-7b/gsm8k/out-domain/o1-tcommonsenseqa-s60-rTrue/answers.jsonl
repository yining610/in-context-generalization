After considering the rest of the question, we determine that Henry is taking 9 pills a week and we can find the total cost of a week.\nStep 3- Now we are looking at the last part of the question, 'and the pills cost each $1.50 more'. Since this seems to say that the pills cost more than $1.50 we know that we must subtract by $1.50.

So the question becomes: what is ratio of P? Step: 6 6) The \"P\" is in regards to who got a ticket. We could use all our steps to figure out how many kids got a ticket and what that ratio is. But, that step can be skipped because the question tells us what kids can't get in... the ratio of how many can't get in compared to how many can.

That's because the question asks how many NOT allowed kids, but the answer is how many allowed and disallowed. This is because we flipped kids between allowed and not allowed from the beginning, and this is why one needs to know the difference. For every the number of kids getting in, 4 were not allowed.

Because one subscription normally costs $34, and from $22.xx, it is $34 \u2013 $22.xx = 11.xx.

So, this way, to solve the question, you can get the numerator by multiplying the total of the numerator by 2 (because to brew 40 cups you need two days) and the denominator by 3 (because you have to brew 4 cups of coffee per cup).\nStep 10 D: The number of cups in each lb. is given as 40. To use this variable in brewing coffee, you have to do it for one of the three days, so, therefore, the number of cups required to brew one lb of coffee per day is 40/3 cups. If you divide 3 cups by 3, you'll get 1 cup, which is the number of cups per lb. Finally we can put 40 cups in one day and 40 cups /3 cups / day to get 15 days.\nStep 11 E: The number of cuprs per lb. is 40 and we can easily brew 40 / 3 cups per day without any difficulty.

They each picked a certain number of apples, and Suraya picked more than Caleb and Kayla picked more than Calebs's pick. From there, it's pretty clear.\nStep 2 : Choose all the variables that are equal to each other. Kayla picked more than Suraya but we don't need to know how many more apples were picked since we know that she picked more than Calebe, but we don't know how many. We could say that the same logic works both ways, so she could have picked 18 apples.\n Step 2 : Choose variables that can't be equal to each other. This isn't really applicable here since we're looking for the number of apples that were picked.\n Step 3 : Check variables that are equal to themselves and eliminate them.\n Step 4 : Arrange the remaining variables in order of increasing number of apples so that we can rule out choices in which a variable is lower than another (if there was Caleb's variable somewhere in the middle of the three remaining variables, we would have to count how many apples were less than his so we could eliminate).\n Step 5 : There are 15 apples in total and Suraya picked more apples than Kayla, so we know Suraya picked more than 15 apples.", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "The maximum weight of the next passenger to get in so that the elevator doesn't exceed its load is 900 pounds, since the total weight of the three adults and the two children is 944 pounds. \nStep 1: The question is asking to identify the maximum weight allowed for the next person to enter so the weight of the elevator does not exceed the maximum capacity. Step 2: Divide the required result by 2 to find the maximum acceptable weight for the next passenger.  Step 3: The sum of the individual weights of everyone is found in the sentence \"Two children whose average weight is $64$ pounds also went inside\".  Subtract the individual weights from the total found in the sentence and set equal to $600$ pounds to make the maximum weight requirement in the elevator $640$ pounds.\nStep 4: Solve the equation $640 = 600 - x$ to find $x$.\nStep 5: The maximum allowed weight for whomever gets in next is $900$ pounds ($640 + x$, the remainder of the total weight minus the value of $x$ from the previous step).

So we have to figure out some of the information: \nStep 1: Jake and his friends spent $1,889, which means $1,881 spent on eating for 14 days because they spent another $1 for the total cost of both dinner. The wife's individual expense is $94 because the price of each dinner is $35 and they both ate one.\nStep 2 Jake and wife have $1,975 each. This is the", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "Step 1: The question is an arithmetic problem with a basic addition. The two variables are Jason and William and the only operation is `4 times more often` which are the same for both.\nStep 2. William goes 2 times a week to the library and Jason goes 1 times a week.\nStep 3. The difference between Williams' numbers and Jason's numbers is 1. The question is asking how many times more often Jason goes to the library than William goes. The number of times (Jason-William) is 1 times more often.\nStep 3a. This means Jason goes 5 times (1+4) more often than William goes 2 times. \nStep 3b. Since Jason goes 5 times more often, then William goes 2 times / 5, hence William goes 2 times less often than Jason. \nStep 5. Summarize: William goes 2 times the library, Jason goes 5 times the library, thus Jason goes 3 times the library as William.\nStep 6. Convert 3 times the library to number of times (add the times 3): So Jason goes to the library 6 times in 4 weeks\n\nInput: There are 18988 students in a state fair.

What is the total percentage of students who like either vanilla or strawberry but not chocolate?\nOutput:Step: 1: The percentage of the students who like either vanila or strawberry but chocolate is the difference of 31.6+28.1=60%-28.1=32%\nStep: 1.7: If we want to subtract a number from a remainder, we multiply the remainder with some number and add the remainder. In this case `28.1% - 31.6%=5.5` and to subtract 5.5 from 40.3%, we multiply `5.5` with to 40.3/100 and add it back the remainder. so the expression changes to `30.", "answer": " 32"}

First, since Mario paid $18 earlier in the week that means he paid $9 before that. $18/$9 is 2. Also, 2 is half of 4. $9/2 is half of $9. To prove this, we can apply the same method on 60. 8/60 is half of 8. This gives us 8. Since the question asks what is double of the last haircut we got, or how much is 8 minutes.

In this case, the instruction states that Andrew and Bob each spent the same amount, but we already know the cost of one of Bob's purchases, which is $2. So the other cost of Bob's purchase must cost more than $2 to make up for what Andy spent alone.  If it was one can of fruit drink, it would be $3.  Hence, the most logical answer is \"B\". The choice \"5\" is not because there are 5 items total, which is already mentioned in the instructions.\n\nInput:Which of the following fractions is greater than the golden ratio?\n\nOutput:As stated in the question, we are comparing two fractions, which can be expressed as \\frac{a}{5000} and \\frac{b}{5000}. So we can divide the whole question into two cases and answer them separately:The first case is where b/5000 is greater than a/5000. We know that \\frac{a}{b} = 5000, meaning if b/500 is smaller than a/50, then a/50 is a greater fraction, and if b/50 is larger than a/50.\nHence the first case cannot happen.  So the second case is where a/500 is greater than b/500. Then b/500 must be > a/500.\n\nInput:Mary\u2019s job pays $11.50 an hour. Her hours were increased by 10% last month. She receives a raise of $1.15 per hour. How much does she make now?\n\nOutput:Let us assume a = 11.50.The first step is to find b. If 10% (b) = 1, then b = 11.15 = 115, but then 115 is now a % of 9, not of 100. This would give us a new b=11.65.Then we can calculate Mary's raise. Araise = b - b.Mary's pay raise", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "Rule 1: We can deduce the number of people he paid off by looking at the number of times he paid twice as much. There's an assumption that Colin has the first payment, as he paid twice as much, so he will have paid twice as much as Colin. We know if Colin has $20, Helen must have at least $40, as Helen paid twice as much. Benedict was the last to receive the money, so it's safe to assume he must've paid $10. Rule 2: The math tells us that Benedict pays half as much as Helen's payment. $10 * 2 = $20, $20 * $2 = $40, $40 * $1 = $40, and $40 + $40 + $20 = $100. So Benedict received $10, and has spent $10 of his money, he must have paid $10. He is therefore paid $10 + $10 + $20 + $40, for a total of $90.\nStep 3 Choices: A) $20, B) $80,  C) $50, D) $10", "answer": " 20"}

There is no indication that the student is expected to make a reasoned argument or provide proof. It simply requires an answer.\n\n\"Working in school\" can be eliminated for similar reasons.

This is the original question.\nHow many floors does the top of a condominium tower have if Earl delivers newspapers on the first and second floors and goes up or down two floors at a time until he is nine floors from the top? (The number of floors that Earl is from the top determines how much more than nine floors must be accounted for.)\nInput: The teacher wants to ask the students to write the question in an appropriate way from this paragraph.Step 1: Write out the original question. Here, we see that the answer is within the context of the math problem (how high up the building is). How does this affect the wording of the question? Choices: A: ask about the total number of floors (option A) B: ask about the number of remaining floors (option B) C: ask about the number between 9 and 11 floors from the top of the tower (option C) D: ask about the height of the tower (option D) E: ask about the total floors the student is away from the top of building (option E) \nOutput: For the context of this problem, what might be a good question might not be a good question for other contexts. For the question in this paragraph, the best answer choice (C) is asking about the number of floors from 9 to 11. This is important because it is within the context of counting the floor that Earl is currently on.

The second cut after this first split would now give Jelly another 4 slices to share which he could give half of to his daughter, but the second half would then fall on the floor when he picks up a slice. Therefore 9 slices for the last cut (giving Jelly 2 slices, and giving away 7). So the final number of slices is 40/5, this gives 8 for each of the first 4 cuts, and 6 for the last (giving Jelly one slice for his daughter).\nStep 3: At this point all other relevant factors are known (except the exact shape of the resulting slice).\nStep 4-6: To find the exact value of the slice, each slice must be considered as exactly one half of the entire pizza, and thus the fraction 1/5 is equal to the fraction 1/2.  Therefore, this one-half of the pizza would contain 8 slices.\nStep 7: Then, to determine the exact slicing of that pizza into the given fractions of a slice is to determine 9 slices worth.\nStep 8: If we consider each of those sections as half of the entire pizzla, then after cutting each such section in half, there would be 7 whole slices left which may be shared with Jelly's daughter.\nStep 9: However, he's not likely to share it quite as evenly as we had just assumed, so there will be 19 in the slice he gives to Jelly.

On Monday, Samson ate three sandwiches for lunch and two for dinner, totaling five sandwiches. On Tuesday, he ate one sandwich.\nStep 3. Identify the question or goal and eliminate any irrelevant information. The question is asking how many more sandwiches he ate on Monday than on Tuesday. The irrelevant information that is to be ignored is any specific details about how many sandwiches of each kind he ate at each meal.\nStep 4. Identify the information that can be used to solve the problem and eliminate any irrelevant patterns. We can conclude that he ate five sandwiches on Monday and one on Tuesday, which means he increased his sandwich count. For the calculation, we can also assume that he ate sandwiches for each meal instead of two for lunch and one for dinner.\nStep 5. Formulate the equation and solve for the correct answer. A = (Monday lunch + Monday dinner + Tuesday breakfast) = 5. Then, let B = 5. Solving for B, we have B = (Monday Lunch + Monday Dinner) - (Tuesday Breakfast + Tuesday Lunch). The relevant variables are Monday sandwich count (A), Tuesday sandwich count (B), and Monday's total lunch and dinner count.\nStep 6. Simplify the equation and double-check your work.

{"text": "Choices: A. 211 B. 375 C. 471 D. 2865 E. 1280 Answer: Choice D. 2876\nStep 1: In our problem of Jake's fortune, the first step would be to first determine the base (i.e. Jake's fortune) which is 80. Jake then donates 20% of his fortune and gives half of the rest to his brother. The initial fortune was 80, after he has given away 20% it will be 64, but Jake gives half of the remainder which is half of 64. Half of 64 is 32. (The first 32 go to his Brother and 16 remain for Jake). Lastly, Jake triples his money, and he donates another 5 bitcoins which is 20% of the total. The initial base is 80.\nStep 2. The next step would be to determine what the remaining 77% of the money is when all 16 are taken away. When 77% of his initial money is taken from Jake, what is he left with? The 77% is 58.2. (58.2 is the remainder) When dividing 80 by 0.77 the answer is 105.46875 which is rounded down to 105. Subtract 105 from the original number (80), and that is how many more bitcoins Jake has in his bank vault. Jake's total bitcoin balance is 105 + 105 + + 16 = 286.68\nStep 3. The last step is to round down to the closest number. This number is 287. When rounded down it will end at 287 which is how many bitcoins does he have.\nThus, the final answer is 287\n\nInput: The answer is 2807503/30. The first 3 digits are 280.

{"text": "Step 1: Determine if a solution is possible. 120 pages is only 6 times 20 minutes, it seems that it is not a multiplication problem. \n\nStep 2: Analyze the problem and solve it. Given the information, we can find an equation for 8 pages and 20 minutes: 8 pages*20minutes = 160 minutes. This can only happen when 8 pages=160 minutes. Also, 8 pages*2 pages = 16 pages, so there are 20 pages in 40 pages. Multiplying 20 pages by 40pages equals 800 pages. So 8 pages*2 minutes = 16 pages*80 pages. 16 pages*160 pages = 2560 pages. So 2560pages*2 minutes = 4640minutes.  This is because 2560=16*4.\nStep 3. The question states that Joy needs _ 6 times as long to read 12 pages. This is because 12 pages =2*3 pages(12=2*3). We can solve the equation by finding how many minutes 12 pages will take Joy to read by dividing 4640 minutes by 12 pages. So how many pages will 12pages equal to? 12pages*4640 minutes =20560 pages.\n12pages*20560 minutes divided by 12 pages =102 =410 minutes.

We can easily calculate that they each get 4.7 bananas on each hand from the total amount of 14 given bananas.\nStep7: Now, the monkeys with 9 bananas on each hand will also get 4.7 on each hand. So that means 4.7 banana will be shared evenly between all 9 monkey hands.\nStep 8: Thus, 9 multiplied by 4.7 gives us the sum of 44.3 bananas for each 9 banana hand.\nStep 9,10 : Similarly, we can find out the sum of 5 bananas for each of the 6 hands having 14 banana and 9 sum of 22.5 banana for each of the 12 hands.\nStep 11: Now we have the total sum and we know that there are 12 monkeys.

Repeating with the other 2 months, January and February, we get 22 cups each. Adding up the sum of 30 + 22 + 22, he would need 74 cups of food over 90 days, or 8.25 cups a day.  Steps 1-4: In order to answer this question, the task can be broken down into smaller ones. As stated, it can be broken down into three main parts: (1) identifying/finding the given time frame; (2) determining how much food needs to be given to the birds for these mentioned months; (3) calculating the final needed amount of food. \nStep 5: Using the final value of 8.25 from step 4, Herman needs 220.48 cups of food, which equals 170.54 cups, using all decimal values of each month and adding them together.

This information is needed to answer the question.\nLet's use what we know:\nCubs: 12 cubs each month\nLion death: 1 lion each month\nOld lions: 12 x 24 = 20th month.\n(This is how Londonolozi got to 148 lonians)\nStep 4:  Answer the question.\nWe have learned that to get to 148, there will be 12 cubs births per month (148/5 cubs born/ month).  The death rate of lions is 1 and the total number of lions (after 12 months) born is 120. This is why:\n5 x 12 months = 20lions (120 - death: 25)\n+ 1 x 12 months\n= 145 lions (148 total). \nStep 5:  This is why we have 120 lions born after the 12 months.

{"text": "Step 2: Let's think about what the question asks.\nStep 3 : In order to determine the answer, the information states: \"Bobby has 15 cars. And the number of cars he currently has is increasing by 50%.\" (Step 4: The problem is asking how many cars he will have in three years. This needs additional information to understand the current number of cars and the rate at which it is increasing.  It is being asked: What number is multiplied to the already current number to get the increased number of cars in 3 years.)\nStep 5 : To calculate the number of toy cars Bobby will have in 3 years, determine the amount of toy cars Bobby has in 1 year, then multiply this number by the rate of increase in 1 year. For Example, if Bobby had 16 cars in 15 years, a rate of 50% increase and 1 year is 12.12% (0.012 = 0.012 multiplied by 100 = 1%). Therefore, if Bobby has 16 cars in the beginning, then the number of cars Bobby would have when added to the 50% increase would be 16+0.5 (16 x 50/100 = 8) = 24", "answer": " 54"}

On Dec. 8 (Saturday), there were half the number of people (75) who visited on Dec. 7 (Friday), when there had been 150 people. These problems can be solved using algebraic equation: A=416 B=75 C=72 When B=C, you know it's Dec. 10 because that's the only day with fewer buyers than there'd been a day before. 410=50A+Y10 (Y is unknown number) Therefore, 88=Y10 so Y is 1000-88=912. 40=B-M Where M is unknown number Now 40=B+10, therefore B=310. \n\nInput:There's a problem a few students are having understanding how to determine unknowns from a proportion.

Solving for unknown (5/7) x (14)=5x/7x x/7 =x/x 5/7 = 1/1 so 5/7 x 5 = 5/7 x14 Subtracting 14 from both sides we get: 5/7= x/5 then 5/7 x5=5/7x1 (divide both sides by 5) 2.5=x (5/7x1-5/7x1)/x (3/7)-(1/7)/x (6/7-4/7)-(1)-/x 1/x-3/7 Divide both sides through by 1 to isolate x as: x/x=1/x+3/7 1/x=", "answer": " 140"}

The \"total\" refers to the sum of the quantities of the colors of the marbles and \"three times\" more refers to the amount, in the example it's three times more than what quantity in the example, 20, therefore we must add 2x2x2=8 more of one of the two remaining color marbles; so let's assume this number is Y. This leaves us with the number of marbles of x different color, (2x yellow, and x not yellow).\nSolution:The blue box is a special box that is three times the size of the red marbles\n\nInput: The blue box is three times the size or the red marbles. There are three times more\ngreen marbles than red marbles. Yellow marbles makeup 20% of green marbles.\nHow many marbles is of a different color if in the total of all marble in the box there are three times more than\nthe number of green marbles. For example let's say we have 1 box and red marbles, 20 green marbles and 10 yellow marbles. I would say there are 20 more red marbles even though yellow are the most abundant. It is 20 more but the question isn't asking how many do we have of different color, but more marbles in different color. Therefore, I must add (6x4) =14 yellow, 3x20=60 red and (6x10) =60 green to come up with 166 yellow, 68 green and 20 red.\nOutput:\n\nThe question wants you to understand \"total\" does not refer to the sum of the different colors of marbles, rather how much of the marbles are of a given color. So we must look in the box and add the number of different colors. There is more red in the box than green. We can't take the 19 green marbles plus the 3 red marbles because we're not asked to add the total of the different colors.

Step 1: We know the number of cups of birdseed Ivan's bird feeler holds is two (2 cups). \nThen we can substitute 2 in the following equation Cups Of Birdseed / Birds Fed Per Cup = Feeder Capacity / Birds Invading Each Week Step 2: Substituting two for the value of cups of bird seed we get Birds Fed Per Cup : 14 + Birds Invading Each Weeks : 7 = Feeder Capacity : 2 Step 3: So Cups Of Birdseed/Birds Fed Per Cup = 2/14 Birds Invading Each weeks /Feeder Capacity = 2 / 7 or 2 = 7 = 2 \nStep 4 : So we can represent the whole equation as: Birds Invading Each weks: 14 - 14 + Birdsfed Per Cup : 11 \nStep 5: So we can say Birds Invading Each wk : 2 = 11 Birds fed per cup : 1 = 7 or the inverse of the two: Birds Invading each week : 11-2= 9 Birds fed per cup 1 = 6 - we can say that number of birds are at least 9 and at most 6-1-1. \nSo the number of birds feeder can feed weekly is between (2-11) = 9 and (11-2) = 9 so we have number of birds feeder feed weekly between 7 and 8. Step 6: 7 = 11-2 (7/11): Since number of birds fed per cup is decreasing from 9 to 6, the number of birds fed will decrease by 4 so we can say 10- birds feeder can feed which is an even number of birds. Thus we can say there are a minimum of 7 birds and a maximum of 8 birds. But we assume the birds to be evenly distributed in the number of birds feeded. So we can say minimum is 7 and maximum is a multiple of 2. \nThus Feeder capacity: 11 Birds Invading Each week: 9 Birds fed: 8\nSo the number of", "answer": " 21"}

Step 05: To compute the answer, all he needs to do is subtract the total footage lost in tying knots from what he has in lengths (8 + 20 + 3(2)'s footage') Step 06: Therefore, the total length is (8 - 1.2 + 20 - 1.2) + \"3(2)\"'s footage' - 3*1.2 = 32*1.2 - 3*1= 37 - 3=34 feet.\n\nInput:A class of 6 people goes on a field trip in which they visit 5 museums. How many ways are there choose exactly 5 people to tour the museums? For example, if you are in this class of 6 students, you can choose five to take the field trip with you in 14 different ways. \nOutput: Step 3: the number of ways we can choose five students, excluding the first person, is 5!/5!= 14. \nStep 5: The general formula to choose N people in a list of S objects: The factorial of \"S\" will be the number of possible ways to select people (where 0! = 1).

If there was 6 more white than grey, then after 10 more minutes, there will be as many grey birds as white. There was a total of 111 birds and now we subtract the 55 white and 105 and we get, 46 white were left after the birds flew off.\nSo the final steps are that after birds flew off, 46 white and 55 grey birds were left.\n\nInput:The problem states \"One summer, two brothers were digging a well. The younger brother was digging fast when the elder brother asked, 'What are you doing? You're going too fast. You're going to undermine the well.' \" This is referring to a well that uses a well bucket to retrieve water by lowering a bucket to the water level and raising it with ropes. The well bucket is suspended from the shaft by cables. The bucket is lowered by reeling in the cable on the spool. The spool is rotated by two pulleys attached to the walls of the shaft. The bucket is lowering by the cable being wound tighter or reeled in which is controlled by the younger brother. As he lowers the bucket too quickly, he is reeling in more cable than is being let out at that moment causing the bucket to accelerate downward faster than it is being lowered. \"Soon the bucket was sinking too fast! As the bucket hit the water, the pressure on the cable caused it to snap.\" What kind of pulley must the well have been built with that caused this?\nOutput:Step 1: After reading the problem, write down the question. \"What kind of pulley must have been used in the well?\"Step 2: Now break down the problem to pieces to solve it.

{"text": "The problem is worded in a way that it is easy to see the solution.\nThere are two pieces to this problem, the house and the porches, which are a part of the house. The question states that the house and the porchoe measure the same dimensions. The question then asks that we roof both the house and the porchos. The question then shows the dimensions and shows that 4.5 feet by 6 feet is 27 feet. (4.5x6x2 = 27) We can then use this method again to figure the footage on the back side of the porch. We can now write the equation: 20.5 + 4.5 + 4 + 2.5 = 27 In a problem like this, we assume that a person is asking you for support rather than the answer; therefore, a reasonable answer is to include the support you would need to provide to someone else who needs your guidance. \n\nInput: This example contains a series of problems, each with a different method.

Rule 2: Paul watches two 1.5 hour movies. Solving the original question, we will solve it in two different units. Answer choice A is NOT the correct answer. Solution: Step 1: The first step would be to change the units of the given question. 'Distance' would be converted to'miles'. Step 2: Convert the original to miles per hour per hour by multiplying by 2 to cover both movies. '12/2' is equivalent to '1' and would leave us with 12 minutes per hour for each movie.

If she buys it individually, she pays $95 (this can calculate how many classes to need to buy the pack to keep her cost at $75).

To solve for how many inches the plants are from bucket B, lets create a few variables, x = # of inches in bucket B and y = # of inches in bag A. Since we are not given the height of these bags, we have to plug these numbers into the equation. For example, sun\ufb02owering from bucket A was 20% talleter than the sun\ufb02ows from bucket B. 30% of what number were the sun\ufb38lowers from bucket A. To find this percentage, we will need to have the base or start number (nun B) and the change from that (y). Thus 30% of 20% would mean 6% of x (20% of 21% would be 6.2%). Lets plug in all these numbers to solve for B. x/1.06 = 20.2 + y/13.92.

{"text": "The question first wants to know how many eggs Tank gathered in the first round, compared to the total number in the pile, and in turn, how many eggs Emma gathered compared to the same value. The number Tank gathered is 25% of the number of eggs in the egg hunt, while Emma gathered 125% of the eggs in the egg hut. Therefore, Tank and Emma together collected half of the number of eggs.\nThe total number of eggs for all egg hunters = 60 -  25 + 125 = 400\nThe number of eggs Tank gathered in first round =  25\nThe total number of egg hunters = 400 -  25 - 60 = 315\n\nTo sum up you need to find:\nNumber of eggs in first round = (125 + 10)/2\nThe answer is (125 +10)/2 * 6 = 660\\\nAnswer (Explanation):\nFrom the last question, we conclude that the value of  660 will be rounded off as 650  (the highest integer <660) which has been mentioned in the question.\n\nTank gathered 10 less eggs than Emma in first round\nFrom this,\n\nTank gathered eggs in first round = 25 + 15\n\nEmma gathered eggs in first round  = 60 - 15\n\nTotal number of eggs in first round 25 + 60 - 30 = 160\n\nSo,\n\nNumber of eggs gathered in 2nd round by all the people who gathered eggs in first round (assuming that number of eggs gathered in first round for both Tank and Emma is zero)\n\n660/3 = 220 \nThe number of eggs gathered by the people from second round has not been asked.\nHowever, 660 is only for the eggs gathered by Tank and Emma so the sum of eggs in second round should be less than 660, so the value is 650 +220 = 870.\\", "answer": " 220"}

If today he were still to own that land, how big would it be in acres?\nOutput: I started off by breaking the number down into 1's and 0's. A 1 has a value of 10 and a 0 is 0. I divided the whole number 101 into 3 digit increments to simplify the problem. For example, 101 divided by 3 would be 37 because the number 3 would repeat for the 3rd time. Repeat steps for any numbers less than 1840 in that case would be 33.\nTo answer the question I added the new value of each section of the number. 33+75=108 108+75=183 183+75=258 168+129=297 177+129=306. When I counted 5 digits instead of 4, the numbers became too long and the answer became more tedious to write down. To add in the fourth number, I had to multiply each number by 3 and add that to the 3rd value to get the 4th digit. I could have just multiplied each number by 3, but as a way to practice multiplication was to multiply every number by 3 and write it by the 3rd digit.\nThe answer after dividing every number into 4th digit became 5834.895834.", "answer": " 84000"}

It is known that the first 5 runners finish with an 8 hour head start before the rest begin running, and the rest have to run another 2 hours after they begin running to finish with the first 5. This suggests that the first set of 5 runners take 8+x hours to finish the race and the rest 5 runners need 2x hours to finish.\nStep 4.

{"text": "Step 1: Analyse the question. The first thing we should focus on is Alison bought some storage tub, but it's not mentioned how many she bought, so we have no idea what the size of these tubs is. We also don't know her budget she has in her garage so to answer the question we should make an assumption that she uses her budget to fill her garage. So our equation will have two variables $x and $y and we know that their sum is 48 (48 is the total cost of all these storage tub).\nLet's see in what form our equation will take. We have the equation $6x+12y=48.\nStep 2:'What do we know?' We know the cost of small tubs ($y) because we have an equation which represents the total cost ($6x+12 y=48). Let's divide the first formula in that equation by 48. We will get $10+6y=1, what we want is to find out what that $6y represents, so we can solve the equation. We also know that the large tubs cost for $6 and that cost $48,so we have an equation with two unknown variables, $y and $x. Lets use a substitution to make the life easier. Let's substitute $4y=x+12y$. Now we can start to solve the equation. First we can assume $y=.5*4$, therefore $y=$4.\nNow we will use $6x+18y=x+1.2*y$ to solve the equation. Let's do it this time in an easier way:\n\n$8x+24y=21$\n\n$x=0.25$\n\n$y=0.2$\n\n$x+y=x-y, which is $= (0.25)^.5 - (0.2)^.5$\n\n$0.0436-0.01$\n\n$\\implies y = 0.206061$\n\nSo the final answer we got is $0.206$.

So from the answer options, A (Apples), B (Orange), and F (All of the options are incorrect) should be eliminated.

The statement \"Twice as much as the...\" in an equation with three values can be interpreted in two ways: A: The value of the apples is twice as much as the value of the oranges, and the pears have the same worth. B: The value of the oranges is twice as much as any number of apples. In terms of the first option, the value of the pears should not be the same as the value of the appels because if that was the case, we'd have something like 4*(20/2).

The first step would be to convert all the tomatoes into units to calculate.\nStep 1: The variables are the plant, and the tomatoes.\n(Plant 1 to Plant N)\nPlant 1 (Plant N) -> Plant X -> Plant Z\nTomato 1 to Tomato NT N1 -> Tomato 1-Tomato (N/2)\nNext we need to find the total tomatoes harvested (T), which is equal to the summation of the tomatoes from each plan. \nT = Sum = \u03a3 (x = 0 until N) (N/T)(plants x, plants x+1). (note the T above and X to Z for the plant names to keep track)\n\nN -> summed = (Plant 1 to the last plant)\n\nNow we know that we total N (T) tomatoes harvested, the next step is to divide by half because that is the number of harvested tomatoes we are to show.\n(T/1)\n\nWe know the original variable T, so to simply re-write the T we can't divide by 0.5 and to avoid confusion, we can rewrite the total tomatoes harvest in fraction of 1. (T)/1 --> T/N\n\nThis equation should look as so  (T)/N + (N - T) = T/2 (note that \u03a3x+1 = \u03a3x = \\sum 1/x [this is the base and floor function notations] or \u03a3x = 1 - \u03a31/x\n\nStep 3:  The problem is to show how to work out the harvest when half the number are dried and dirtied and one-third are used in marinara (3.5 tomatoes). However, we are not given any other number of tomatoes in marinara, how they use it, etc. to show that half+1/3 = 0.5 (or to have some evidence for it). Thus, we are told to show half the tomatoes in marina. \nStep 3: Half the total tom", "answer": " 42"}

She had earlier decided to split the total number of sales profit from that week into 2 parts. One part she decided to keep with herself and the other part she asked for from her family and friends as a donation.\nSo, on dividing the total profit earned in a week, she keeps $480 as the first part of that profit for herself and asks for $720 from her family and friends to make it $700. However, it is further stated that the donations were totalled at $310 dollars and the remaining requirement to make up the $610 was the amount that had to be added to the profit earned.\nStep 3:- As per the requirement stated above, the trader had an end goal of $610 which she needed additional $310\nStep 4:- To add to that, she took another amount which was one half of her profit from the sales and the other half she asked for from her friends and family. Now to meet her goal, she only needs to add to her profit and make it total $970.\nStep 5:- So, it can be said that $840 is the sum she needed to add to the profit from the week sales to make it total $960 which would satisfy her requirements. Now, to meet that shortage or make that additional amount, she asked for another $310 from her friends and family and the final sum would be $970\nStep 6:- Now you get that the profit above the goal, would be $97-960=$194 dollars.

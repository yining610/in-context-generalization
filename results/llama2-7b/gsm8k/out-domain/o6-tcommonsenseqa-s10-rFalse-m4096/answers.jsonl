{"text": "This problem is a system of equations with 3 unknowns:  4 and 3.  If we add two equations to each other, like we did in class, then one of the unknowns will have the variable cancel out. We can then use the equation we are left with to solve for the non-cancelling variable.  For this problem, we could first write out an equation and solve for 3.   For each of the stuffed animals, the cost of each was $x dollars.  Their total cost was (x + x) = 36.\n\nThen, we can use:  Stuffed animals cost 2x dollars each.\n\nThen, their total cost was (Stuffed animals cost x dollars eatch) = 21. \n\nTish said that 2 stuffed animals had a total cost of $36, so these equals to 18.

{"text": "Output: 3/12th cubic feet\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIf we multiply the width by the length, that's how I get 4 feet, as the width is 6. Then I multiply that by 3 to get 6 feet of width. Then I did that over and over and got 9 feet, then I multiplied 6 by 3 feet, and that's 18 feet, but I only need to do 6 feet of width again and then add all three values. That would give us 18 feet, 36 feet, and 9 feet. That gives us 36+18+9= 53. That 53 feet of length and 36 inches of length. (Note: 1 inch = 16 cubic inches in volume) To find the volume of the aquarium you have to multiply width by the length and that would be 6  x 4 = 24 cubic inches and then multiply that by the height which would be 36, that would give us 864 cubic inches and the final answer would be cubic inches = 864.\n\n### Input\n\n- The store was busy for it is Saturday morn.

Then when it exceeds the value of \u201cnumtimes\u201d you should be passing it along to the next function called updateCounter() but it should be updated to be one before it gets there, so that each time through the whole thing repeats. For example: if you input 3 and then the loop repeats 3 times, the for loop would hit i=0 three times before hitting i=1.\n#### 3.\\ Once you have passed your variable to the function", "answer": " 95"}

You would cycle through that and at the end, you would just change the filename to stop your loop.

{"text": "Answer:  \n\n## Instructions:\n\n### Democracy - The system of government which gives citizens the responsibility of voting on important issues.\n\n### Example - Voting on a public park.\n\n### Output:\n\n### Example: A citizen in a democratic country is permitted to vote for which new park is to be built, and at the same time, the citizens in the democratic country hold the government responsible for what is built in the park.\n\n## Democracy - The system the is a government where the citizens elect the leaders. The United States is considered a democratic country and is an example of how democracy works.\n\n## Representative democracies and a republic.\n\n### Definition and explanation:\nA representative democracy is a system in which citizens choose an individual who represents them and makes decisions for them. Although the decisions ultimately are made by the elected representative, the citizens still have an influence on the government by being able to vote out its officials.\n\nIn a republic, the people in a country have ultimate control over the government and elect people who in turn represent the citizens in the country's decision-making process.  \n\n### Example 1: Example of a Representative Democracy - Canada, where the citizens elect their representatives who represent them in the government.\n\nIn Canada, citizens vote on candidates for their local, provincial and federal governments. Candidates from each party are elected to represent the people in the house of their government. These leaders then propose and enact new laws that impact or better the lives of the people in the nation.\n\n### A representative of the citizens is voted on.The citizens do not have 100% influence over the government.\n\n### The citizens select leaders to represent them.\nAll citizens age 18 and over have an opportunity to voice their opinions and vote in the government.\n### The people of Canada are able to vote out their government if they do not like the laws put into place or if the people are not happy with the government's decision making.\n\n### Explanation: In a representative democracy, the people have the ability to vote on each candidate. However, the elected official makes the final decision, regardless of the votes cast. This is called representative democracy because elected officials represent the citizen that voted for them.", "answer": " 72"}

So divide the 6 cups by 4 to get 3/4 for the cup left after the pitcher is full. Then subract to get the number of cups of lemonaide. 3 - 3/4 = 11/4. Then divide 18 by 11/4 to get 13 cups.

Remember that you're given a cup for the drink, so you should add a 1/4 to the drink when you divide by 1/8 to get 4.

{"text": "The correct answer to this problem is three window-sittting Dutch Americans.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nFrom the math question we could only know one answer to this \"where are you if your reading from magazines\". So to make a full problem to solve, we can say a car.\nWe have many answers here: ground, market, doctor, bookstore. But we know that in this response we only have 4 answers so we look for the most appropriate answer to this paragraph.\nAnd we get the best answer that \"B; the doctor\"\n\n### Now we can only say 5,6 and 1. Because we already know that the answer is greater than three and less than ten.\n\nNow we can get the answer. One, six and six.\n\n### Because 6 can only divide 6 and 6. Thats 3.\n\nAnd six can also only divide once by 6 because the value of 6 is more than the quantity of 1+2+3 and less than the quantity of 7+8+9.\n\nWe can solve it the other way around. With the formula:\n`$X/D+R=E`\n\nIf we have:\n\nE=3\nx=5,6,1,...?\nD=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\nR=1+2+3=6\n\nIf we take the average, it comes out:\n4,5,1... or: [average](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/696936/how-do-i-find-the-average-sum-over-a-list-of-integers)  of 26, 13\n\nIf we subtract the remainder:\n13-6=7\n26-6=20\n\nTo solve the equation you can do:\n\n$\\frac{X}{4+1-26}=\\frac{X}{13-6}=3,2,1...$?\n\nComment: This is very nice!

{"text": "The combined time it took the alligators was 1 day 6 hours. The River Nile, where Paul started from, is 4,258 miles long and the Nile Delta is 2,534 miles long. Paul traveled 50 miles east back to his start. Six other alligators left with him. So, the combined distance is 50 + (6x50) = 300 miles because  the other alligators travel in the same direction he did. Paul took 2x4hours to walk the 50 miles. He returned to the start at 70 miles. There are 1,218 miles between Paul's start and the Nile Delt. The combined 70 miles of Paul and the other alligators plus the 1,212 miles of only Paul is 1,217+30=1,247.

{"text": "27 are in the canteen.\n\n### Notes: \n1. If 1/3 of the students who are in class are in the exam room, and the remaining examinee, the number is 80. Then 3/4 of 80 are 60 examiners in the exam room, 60 is less than 1/2 class, that means some students have to be given for examination.  By the order of 1/3, it means 30 students are in room. But if you added 40 students together 1/10 was absent, while 30 students were examiners in the room, the room for the rest 10 people is the canteen.\n2. To solve the 40th question is still same idea. Because 2/4 is less, it means 60 students in a classroom and 40 in the canteen. 3/4 students were in the classroom means 24 students left in the classroom. But if 60 people were in class room, 24 + 40 is 64, it means that 50 students in the class room. Then how many ones were absent? If 1/16 you left 16 ones and 1/3 of 50 means 16 missing.\n3. The last question can be solved by using the following reasoning. \n20 in the classroom means if 1/3 in the classroom, 30-20 is 10 absentee and 1/3 is 10, left over 6 absentee.

{"text": "The gift costs $927, with the remaining group splitting the cost and sharing an increase in cost of $8 more. It took the group of 10 to share a gift cost of $1000. They then divided that cost equally ($100/10 or $10 each), paying $10 each. But after four left the group, all remaining 6 paid $10 each, as well as 8, paid again. If the group split the cost and all paid the original cost ($1000) plus $8 more ( $108 or $18 each), it totals $1098 for a total price of $927 ($927 = $1098 - 100=$ $998 -100=$88).\n\n### Outputs:\nOutput: The gift cost $927, as all groups split the cost and all added $8 per share. So 1000 costed $1000, then 100/12 = $83 + 100/6 = $83 + $166 =$259 to split the remainder to $108 in increase. So 108/$10  = $10.80. So 10 group members paid $10 for the gift which is $100, but 4 dropped out. 4 split the cost that had paid $10, but now 2/2 = $10. So another group paid $10/5 = $2. But there were six total who paid remaining $20/12 =$1.66 for $1.66. So total group paid $1098, minus the original split cost of $10600 which is $928.\n### Conclusion\nThe group costs of split of each remaining group member added 8 to each and one dollar to be added to each remaining 6 paid to the group, which makes ten, or 10 total gift costs.\n\n### \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question.\n### Demontration:\nInput: Which of this following are not used in sewing?

Each boat must stay 2 inches from the edge or the bank. 42 feet - 2 inches = 40.4 inches 10 inches x 40.4 = 404 What does this mean? The average distance between the boats is 40.4. We rounded twice, which is why we need to multiply our answer by 40.4 so 40.4 x 6 is 242.4 so we have 4 boats, not 3.\n\n### Credit:\nDark, S.; Oddy, E. (2021, April 8). P2 Math 8. [Prezi].

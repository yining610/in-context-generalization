{"text": "90\n\n### Explanation\nThe best way to solve this question is to break the question into 2 parts. The first part, to simply the equation: if there are 10 servings per block and if you have eaten 5 of it, then what is remaining.\n\nThe second part is once you solve for the answer, subtract that answer from the total calories in that block. In this case 110 - 90 leaves you with 20. This is equivalent to doing it the other way, taking the 90 and subtracting the 5 servings.\n\n### Examination: What did you encounter?\nThis problem had a few different challenges. The first was that the test had a little more than 100 questions and you only had 30mins to do all the questions. This made this question a little difficult as you will have to sacrifice efficiency. Secondly the number values could have been written out, which I think would have made a difference for some questions as to whether they should put in the decimal.\n\nAnother is that as there are many question, it becomes very easy to mistake a question as being the same. For example, Question :  is the same, B as (A) and (C). The question does not tell you the question category either, so it isn't clear.\n\nLastly, I had this problem where I always try finding a better way to do the problem and the answer I'm getting. As a result you might miss or you will not try as hard at finding the best path as you think you already know.", "answer": " 1210"}

This event happened when I was 10 years old, and it was very sad for me. My friend's family, especially her mother, had taken care of me since I was a baby. They had always been so nice to me, and I felt really bad when I heard she had passed away. It was also hard because my friend wasn't around much because her father had to take care of her, and he was pretty busy at work. It was also sad to see how her father was dealing with the death of his wife. I haven't really spoken much about it with anyone other than my other friends who were around at the time, but I still remember how sad it made me feel.\n\n\nYour next question: How would you do better in this situation\ninput: you went on", "answer": " 49"}

What will the working time be greater than?\nOutput: Saturday\n#### Solution\n##### Question (Q1):\nI feel like you'd have to factor in the time until the next time you talk.

{"text": "35\n\n### Demostration:\n1. The sentence can be broken down into two parts: The number of files downloaded in the first round, 800 and the percentage of files that were unrelated, 3/5. From these, we can determine that there were 400 files downloaded in total.\n2. We first need to determine the proportion and percentage of available files that were related and relevant. To do this, we must subtract the number of irrelevant files in the second round of downloads from the number of files downloaded in total. This gives us 400 - (400 - 120)/5 = 400 -(360)/5 = 360/5 which equals 72.\n3. The total number of files being related is thus 400-360/5 = 40 files. Since we know the percentage of irrelevant files, and the total number of files to start with, using the formula: 360/ (800-361X360)/5 we can find the number of remaining files to be (((400-3) + (360 - ((800-3)-3)*360))/5) = (200 + (354 - ((800 - 3 + 3 + 3)*360) = (20 + (351)*360)/5) = 400*351/5 = 35.\n4. Now that we have all the information needed, it's simply a matter of plugging in and solving the problem. If we have 800 files to start with, and 400 files were deleted, then 400 of the total number of files were unused. The number for the second round of download is 400 - 360 = 40 files, and the number for the 3rd round of downloads is 400-120 = 280 files, which is more than the number of useful files from the 2nd round.\n5. Since the 3rd round contained fewer files, we must have at least 88 unused files. For the 4th round, we would have subtracted 40, which would leave us with", "answer": " 400"}

Therefore the total profit will be $1150 when Noah sells:\n12 large pictures: 600 + 600 = 1200\n20 little pictures: 60 x 4 x 20 = 2400\n7. $1150 = $750 + $ 300 + $350 = 550 + 200 + 20\n8.

A: 1,888 could be the solution, but it makes more sense to subtract \"seven\" from 1,28 to make that solution 1,28 instead.\n2. B: this could be a solution, as 7 - 7 = 0.

E: Here, we must account for the toast bought by each customer. The amount of each must be subtracted from the amount of eggs bought. One slice of toast costs 1 pound and two slices of toast costs 2 pounds. The amount of eggs bought by Dale is 2 eggs, which costs 6 pounds.

By working long hours to earn the performance, you now make over an hour more per hour.\n\nAbove are instructions and responses to a task. The next pages contain a full description of this task.\n\n### Background:\nThe task contains eight questions related to information about earnings, bonuses, and working hours in a performance-based job. The question asks for the per-hour wage of the employee given the information. \n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following five graded math questions.\n\n### Rationales:\nAll the questions seek to find the per-hour wages of the employee given the details of the job, working hours, and extra pay.\n\nThe first question asks to find the hourly wage of an employee that gets paid $80 a day, works for eight hours, and has the option to work hard to earn a payment of an extra $25 a day. The extra effort gives him an extra hour of work each day, hence, he is making an extra $25 per day after the extra work.\n\nThe second question asks to find the per-day payment of an employee that gets $80 for working eight hours a day, plus additional payment of an extra $50 a day for working two hours overtime. Since the employee gets paid an hourly wage of $80, he has to work an additional two hours (for a total of $20 per hour) to earn the extra payment.\n\nThe third question asks to find the daily wage of an employee who has a $90 wage at the beginning of each day, and the option to work overtime for an additional payment of $45 for every hour over eight hours. The employee must work the additional three hours to collect the full payment of $135.\n\nThe fourth question asks to find the wage of an employee earning $80 a day who earns a bonus equivalent to 10% of her wage and works overtime for an additional $38 for every hour over eight. The employee must work overtime for three hours of the day to earn an additional bonus and bonus payment of $65 plus $1", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "He still has 20 mangoes, which is the answer to the question\n\n### Instructions:If a piece of bread is 20 cm long, how long will it take to eat the bread 3/5 the length of the piece of bread?\n\n### Demostration:\nIt's important to note that the length of the entire piece of bread (20cm) is subtracted from the length of the remaining slice (3/5 of the 20cm). Therefore, it takes less time to consume the remaining piece of bread because you are only eating a smaller portion of the entire length.\n\nIt can be interpreted that you will take half of the time originally planned. The original time of 20cm which is 20 seconds is divided by the 5/3 which is 1-0-5 seconds.\nYou will not eat in 20 seconds the entire bread because already you have had the 10cm of bread before dividing is. Half of 10cm is 5cm and this time you will eat is added to the half the time you originally planned (5cm/5seconds x 4seconds ) to take the time to eat the remaining piece (5cm x 5seconds = 25secs ) which is half the time (25 secs / 2 = 12.5seconds) from 20 seconds that the original plan had estimated. \n\nSo, the answer is: You will eat the remaining piece of bread half the time you originally estimated.\n\n### Input : How would you express 10 + 10 + 20 using only parentheses?\n\n### Instuctions: If there is any other mathematical operation you could express the answer using only (), brackets.\n\n### Steps : \n1.

Choices: A: They found it on him B: When the person did it before C: The person committed it D: This witness did it too E: The person did it when he was drunk \nRationales: Answer: \nWhen a witness reports that someone at a crime scene may have committed a crime, the suspect can be charged with the crime based on the witness's statement if the police can prove that the suspect had contact with evidence at the crime scene. The only exceptions to this rule are if witness statements are contradictory or impossible, or if the witness provides false evidence in court. In this case, the witness statement may be used as a motivation to investigate the suspect further, but it cannot be the basis for a criminal charge since the witness cannot be proven to know for sure what happened. However, if police find evidence of guilt from a suspect after making an arrest, they must continue their investigation into that suspect's possible innocence or guilt. Therefore, a suspect can be charged with a crime based on a witness's statement if and only if the police can prove it. Therefore, when police make an arrest, they cannot use it as evidence of the suspect's guilt since it cannot be proven conclusively. Instead, they must continue investigating to see if additional evidence can be found against the suspect. But if evidence does not show up, they must conclude that the suspect is innocent.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: They got in an accident while driving back to their house, where did they find her?

{"text": "The best answer to this question was B: $66 per hour which was the minimum choice option. I went for this answer because as stated by the problem, it's assumed that the bakery will be able to sell all pieces and sell one for $4. Also, the $66 was calculated on the assumption that the bakery made 12 pies and sold out all of their product in an hour.\n\n### Demo:\nStep 1: The first step in solving this task was to understand what the questions were asking and what the choices were given. The question was asking how much money the bakery will make, and the choices were $26, $38, and $66. \n\nStep 2 : Next, the problem was broken down into smaller, more manageable problems.\nStep 3: At that time, we considered two things:\n-\tHow much is it costing to make a single pie?\n-\tHow much does a single pie sell for?\nThe cost to make a single pie, or the total cost of creating all the piers, was found by adding up the choices: 0.5*12 which gave us $6. This is because each pie costs the bakerey 0.5 dollars to make. \nThe sale price of a single pie at $4 was found by adding the choices: 4*3 which gave us $12. This is because each of the 12 pies sells for $4.\n\nStep 4: Using the information gathered at Step 3, we worked out the minimum profit that the bakery would make during one hour, which was then used to calculate the total amount the bakery would earn from selling 12 pies over a 1 hour period. The calculation is as follows:\n\n(profit from the least expensive item) * (quantity of items sold) = profit made\n\n(66) * (12) = 792\n\nAnswer B : 792 which is equivalent to $66 per hour.\n\n## Examples of Non-Cognitive questions\n\n### Input\nWhat time does the person need a ride to school at 9:20PM\n\n### Instructions:\nA friend will take you to school on this day.

The first strategy is to combine the number of letters in the sentence with the word count in the sentence. For the first instance, the word count is eight and the sentences word count is 19, resulting in the total word count of twenty-seven. A four-letter word is then searched to complete the sentence, as there are only 27 letters in the sentence. The second strategy is based on context, as the letters within the sentence are typically from a standard vocabulary, and may often indicate a mathematical operation. In this case, the letters \u2018+\u2019 can be added to complete the equation. When combined strategies are used, they can provide a more reliable detection of potential problems.\n  - The combination approach, which combines two strategies, can be used to solve these two problem scenarios. In the first event, seven is an acceptable total word count, and adding the remaining letters to the end of the sentence results in 14+1=15. \n  - In the second situation, the contextual word length analysis may not have picked up the issue with the correct total word count, as the number 19 was found in the word count. This situation highlights the importance of multiple solutions and the use of a combination strategy.", "answer": " 49"}

{"text": "20\n\n### Rationale:\nStep One The solution, with respect to the question, is to find out how long tony takes to assemble a widget, in minutes.\nStep Two 1. The first thing to do is to eliminate the options that can't be the answer choices since none of them represent what the question is asking for. 1.1. Tony can't be the option since all they know is tony worked the entire shift. 1.2. Sam can't be the response because he only assembled for 6 hours and he did finish the 14 widgets he was supposed to have finished. 1.3. Jack has also worked the whole 8 hours, so it's not him. Tony also works faster compared to Jack on his first shift.\nStep Three 1. The remaining options are to eliminate 1.3, which is faster compared to 1.1. 1.1 is faster compared to 2, but we can't say 2 is 1.3. 2. Now it's left with 2 and 1. 2. It would have taken jack 12 widgets to be done at his normal rate per hour. 2. Tony's rate of production for this question is unknown. So, we assume that it's the same as jack. This would need jack around 6 hours to finish 40 widgets according to Tayor's 1 widget every 30 minutes. For 20 widgets, it's 10 hours and there's at least another 5 hours after Jack's 40. 3. So, we're not sure now if it's 20 or 40, so, again eliminate all the even numbers including 8, 10, 12, etc. 4. 6 widgets for 6 hours takes around 1 hour, not 2.

{"text": "He has 32 grandchildren.\n\n### Rationale: 4: Each child of Max also has grandchildren. Therefore, Max would have grandchildren if the first two child have 5 grandchidren each. Answer:4\n\n### Input : What would do to the best of her ability?\n\n### Choices:\n\nChoices A: Be the best she could be.\n\nChoices B: Always give her best.\n\nChoices C: Work as hard as possible. D: Keep her eyes peeled. She got a job.  \n\n### Choice A: Be the best that she could be:\n\nThis is not the best answer because it could be interpreted differently. Be the best that she can be can be interpreted to represent a minimum standard. Instead, they could be interpreted to be much better than the minimum or best.\n\n### Choosis B: Always give her her best:\n\nThis is a possible answer, as \"always giving her best\" implies setting a high standard. However, it could also be perceived as an obligation or requirement rather than an active effort.\n\n### In Choosis C: Work as hard possible:\n\nThis answer represents hard work and effort, which is suitable, because hard work and effort are what one hopes for in the workplace.\n\n### For Choosis D: Keep her eyes open:\n\nThis choice doesn't seem appropriate, as keeping her eyes open does not necessarily indicate effort or hard work. It could simply mean being aware of their surroundings. Additionally, the phrase \"for the best\" is not used, so the statement still doesn't seem like a suitable response.\n\n### Therefore, the answer is Choosis C. Work as hard as possible:\n\nAnswer: C: Work as hard \n\n### How do you know if something is a good answer?\n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that if the answer fits the criteria, meaning if your answer fits the question, then you should go with. For example, if the question is asking for the age of someone, if you've provided a value of 30, then you have a good answer. \n\nThe same thing would be true if you've provided an address that doesn't lead to a location or you've provided someone's age as a string of numbers and not a number", "answer": " 58"}

He was lucky and was able to rent a flat tire for a dollar. He realized he needed a lug wrench for the rental but he was out of them as well. He was able to find a tool shed and find some for free. Is it better to be lucky or be prepared?\n\n### Rationales:\nIs it better to be luck or to be prepared?\n    1. Let's go over each choice:\n        1. Lucky:\n            1. It's the right answer for the question.  \n        2. Prepared:\n            1. Luck is a risk factor, you can't always count on it.\n            2. Prepared means having the necessary tools and equipment to do a job, and it is a safer way to do it.\n            3. There are always uncertainties, and you can be prepared for them.\n            4. Rental is always an option when in need of it.\n            5. You can't afford to be without supplies of any kind.\n            6. Being prepared saves time, money, and hassle.\n\n### Answer: \nIs it better to get lucky or be prepared. We can agree that \"being prepared is always better.\" A person can be lucky and unlucky. You never know what will happen in a situation. You can be lucky with money. But at the same time, someone can be lucky with their car. But then, the brakes can fail. And it ruins the day. It can get to costly to keep spending money on car replacements.

{"text": "Sheila\u2019s pigs will total $30,000.\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1: We can first recognize that the question asks us for the ending balance of Sheila's piggy bank.\nStep 2: Next, we use the provided information to determine how much is being added to the piggy bank each month, then apply the formula P(1+r/n) where:\n\n- `n` = number of months\n- `r` = rate%\n- `P` = principal\n- `r` - rate%\n\nStep 3: We determine the total amount added each month (or total amount added over the 4 year period) is $\\$30.000$.\nStep 4: We can then calculate the ending balance using the formula:\n\n- `C` = total added\n- `P`  = initial balance\n- `n`  = months\n\nTherefore, from the previous steps, we can determine that the ending balance is $\\$30,001.43$.\n\n### Input They found the wires, they did not do what? Choices:A: burn B: remove C: replace D: throw away E: cut\n\nRationales:\n\nStep 1. \n\n1.The question is asking us about what a person does after finding the wires. \n\n2.To answer this question, we interpret each choice and find the one that aligns the most with the action of \"finding the wires.\"\n\nStep 2.\n\n1.The first option, \"burn\" is not related to the question. Burning the wires has nothing to do with finding them, and we disregard this choice.\n\n2.The next option, \"remove\", could have been used before finding the wires, as removing them would require searching for them. This option doesn't seem to be the best fit.\n\n3.Option \"replace\" is similar to \"remove\", but it only makes sense after the wires are removed and not before. Therefore, this choice does not seem to be plausible.\n\n4.So, out of the existing choices, the only one that makes sense is \"throw away\" as finding the wires would mean knowing where they are located and can be thrown away.\n\nTherefore", "answer": " 23248"}

(B) - Yes, this is true because the people who made the vaccine made a fortune. (C) - My mother is very skeptic of anything that has a brand name because she thinks the price or quantity does not relate to its quality. (D) - It depends on the context, but usually this applies to many people because there is usually a lot of waste while people still cannot access the vaccines they need. (E) - This is probably true because vaccines are a business.

It might take a while or just within some reasonable timeframe. \n     \n   2. \"didn't take her long\":\n      1. Since it didn't take her a long time it seems like she is a natural born cook. \n      2. The sentence suggests that learning how to cook came easy.\n  \n   3.

{"text": "A zoo spends **3 hours** recovering animals\n\n### Demostration:\n\n#### Answer:\n1. Let us assume that recovering an animal takes two hours.\n2. There are 5 animals that escape from the zoo, so there total time taken to recover the animals is 5 * 2 = 10 hours.\n3. Let us assume that the first animal is recovered in one hour, thus, the second one to be recovered is not the second, nor the third, but rather the fourth animal. The zoo takes one more hour to recover the fourth animal, thus we subtract 1*1 from 10 to get 9 hours.\n4. Let us assume that we now recover the third animal and the last one to be recovered is the fifth one, as the animal that has already been recovered is at the last place. But since we already subtracted 1 hour, we subtract another 1 hour to recover the animal, thus 8 hours.\n5. After recovering all the animals, this process required a total of 9 + 8 + 1 = 18 hours.\n6.

{"text": "2550\n### Justification:\nStep 1: Interpret the Question\n\nThe goal of the first step in the process is to interpret the question, separating its parts into individual pieces.\n\nThe question \"In Mary's class...\" implies that the scenario described is about a group of people. If this were not the case, \"their\" could refer to a single person, implicating their personal assets instead of the group's, which is more likely.\n\nWe can also interpret the question to imply the scenario is hypothetical, as the class isn't a real school that exists.\n\nStep 3: Interpret the Individual Pieces\n\nStep 3 begins with the analysis of the individual pieces of the question.\n\nWe interpret that in this scenario Mary's class has 25 students, which is consistent with the question.\n\nNext, in this question, we analyze the group of students: their teacher. This teacher is telling them that they can either pay full amount or half amount for a project. The phrase \"they all\" indicates that all of them pay the full amount for the project at $50.\n\nWe determine that this means the total amount they need $2500\n\nWe also conclude that four students out of 25 chose to pay half, which indicates that each of the remaining $2450 was paid by the five students in Mary's class.\n\nThis information provides us with the following data, which we can use to complete the computation.\n\n$50*25 = $1250\n\n$1250+ $0+ ($50*4) = $2450\n\n$2450+$500 = $2950\n\n$(2950 / 25) = $118\n\n$(118/2) = $59\n\n$2950 / (25-2) = $10500/23\n\n$10500 * 23 = $ 25500\n\nThis means that the amount the teachers collected was $25500.\n\n### Input 23: What is the last name of the woman who wears a red shirt on 5 February then two people in the same picture who have the", "answer": " 1150"}

{"text": "The rate of hiking was.668 mph.\n \n### Rationales: To start off, we know two pieces of information immediately. First of all, the person Arlene was female, otherwise stated as, she was a woman. This is important because women have proportionally shorter legs than men. Next, the temperature was set at 60-degrees Fahrenheit, this is important because at this temperature it is assumed Arlene was hiking in a comfortable and casual environment. \n\nNext, we know Arlene's weight, height, and backpack weight. Arlene weighed 106 pounds, her height is 5-feet tall, and her backpack weight was 60 pounds. Since Arlene is 5-feets tall, we can assume she hiked in a 6-inch step, or 1-foot per step. This will be important information. We will be able to use this in order to calculate Arlene's rate of hiking, given her body proportions and the temperature. \n\nLet's start off by taking Arlene's measurements and breaking them down into inches. We begin by knowing that Arlene weighs 106-pounds, and that she is 5-feeth tall. Then we know that the feet to inches ratio is 12, this means Arlene's feet is 12-inches. The next ratio is inches to feet, 12 can be broken down into: 12/12*12=1. This means Arlene is 1/24 of a foot tall or 1-inch tall. Then, from Arlene's height measurements, we know she took 6-inches steps. Multiplying 12 by 1-inch gives us 12-inch walk: 12*1=12, and multiplying 6 by 1-inch we get 6-inch: 6*1=6. Thus, using 6-inch for steps and 12-inch for feet, we get 1-inch for every 2-inches, or 1/24: 6/12=1/24, or 1-inch each step. Then, multiplying 6-in", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "Dear sir,\n\n### Demostration:Jeff spends 3 times as many hours on Facebook every weekend as he spends working on Monday through Friday. By my calculation, his total Facebook time on weekends is a total of 3 hours. In addition, he spends 4 times as many hours working Monday through Friday. Therefore, his total working hours in the week are a total of 12 hours\n\nRationales:\n\n- First, understand what the question is essentially asking. The question asks, \"How many hours does Jeff spend working in an entire (week)?\"\n\n- We can break the question into various pieces and apply logic to each of them. \n  - (Who is he?)\n    - Jeff is the man who is mentioned in the question.\n\n  - (Catching up on Facebook)\n    - Jeff spends three times as much Facebooking as he does working.\n\n  - ((Who he is Facebooking))\n    - He is Facebooking (with) his pals.\n\n  - (\"Facebooking pals\")\n    - Jeff spontaneously calls his friends his pal.\n\n- Considering all these aspects, we can assume that Jeff's Facebook time is related to the number of Facebook friends he has. \n- We can also deduce some information about his working time based on how much time he spends catching up on Facebook. \n\n- If he spends three times as long Facebooking as he does on work, but he spends about four times as many hours every working day on Facebook, it would be difficult to imagine that he spends fewer than one working day on Facebook.\n\n  We can now use the information we found above to start answering the question. \n- Working Hours in a Week\n  - 12 hours\n    - Total time is: (4) + (1) = (5)\n\n- Facebook Hours in a Weekend\n  -.5 hours\n    - He spends 3 times more working hours than he does Facebooking.\n    - Therefore, since he spends three times more working hours than Facebooking, we can assume that he spends.5 x 3 = 1.5 hours Facebooking.\n\n- Weekend Hours\n  - 3 hours\n    - Total is: (1.5) + (", "answer": " 62"}

Instruction:\nAnswer the following math question.\n\nInput: What type of number has more than 200, but less than 300 digits?\nRationales: To answer this question, we look for a number that has more than 2 digits (i.e., it cannot be a \"single\" digit), more than 2 hundred digits (therefore, it cannot be a \"three digit\" as the term \"three digit\" already has a specific definition of being a number having exactly 3 digits), and less than 30 thousand (therefore, it is also not a \"three digit\" number).\n\nThe first option to choose is any number starting with the digit \"2\" (e.g., \"200\", \"201\", \"202\",..., \"212\"). \n\nSince all these digits are less than 30 in number, and since numbers starting with \"2\" are not considered \"three digit\" numbers, they are not a valid answer. \n\nThe second option we can try is any number starting with \"3\", such as the digits \"300\", \"301\", \"302\",..., and so on. \n\nHowever, when we start counting from the \"3\" and go into hundreds of digits, they will end up being less than 30 hundred (i.e., less than 30,000), which is the required condition. \n\nThus, any number starting with digits \"3\" is also not a valid answer.\n\nThe third option we can try is a \"four digit\" as a valid answer because there are four digits in the number, and because a \"four digit\" can have more than 20, but fewer than 30 thousand digits. \n\nHowever when we try the digits \"400\" as well as other \"four digits\" in the range \"440\" to \"499\", they turn out to be less than 30 \"three digit\" (numbers of exactly 3 digits). \n\nTherefore these answers cannot be correct.\n\nThe fourth and only remaining option is a \"five digit\" as a valid choice since a \"five digit\" has the same requirement to have more than", "answer": " 27"}

This means we'll evaluate each of the following options:\n\n    * Option A: \"same amount.\" If both Mary and Rose spent the same amount of money, they clearly did not spend $50 together on a pair of sunglasses. This eliminates this choice.\n\n    * Option B: \"five pairs of sunglass.\" We can easily see Rose bought a pair of jeans, not \"five pairs of jeans.\" This also eliminates this choice. \n\n    * Option C: \"five pairs of shoes\" does not fit the wording either. This choice is eliminated. \n\n    As a result, all of the choices are eliminated, hence, the answer must be a pair of shoes. \n\n2. Next, determine which answer option describes the amount spent by Rose.\n\n    * She spent $150 on shoes and $100 as a pair of jeans.\n\n    This means Mary bought two expensive pairs of sunglass as well as a $100 pair of shoes.\n\n3. Determine which option shows the amount spent by Rose for the decks of basketball.\n\n    * $150 is the same amount as $150-1 = $149, making the price of one decks of basketball cards is $149. \n\n4.

We want to determine which side is the largest in the diagram. \nStep 1: Understand the diagram given. \n(1) A rectangle is a regular polygon with four sides and four angles. \n(2) A square is a regular polygon with 4 sides and 4 angles. It also has equal length and sides. \n(3) A parallelogram has two pairs of equal sides and two pairs of equal angles. \n(4) In the diagram, one can see a rectangle (shape 1) and a square (shape 2). It is given that two other \"shapes\" also exist; one shape is a parallelogram (shape 3), and the other is not visible (shape 4). Also, by observing shape 3, we can conclude it has two pairs of equal angles and four angles. 7) This information, when combined with shapes 1 and 2, allows us to deduce that shape 4 is not a rectangle or a square, and since it has four angles and two pairs of sides, it must be a parallelogram. Therefore, shape 4 is a paralleloogm. Since there can only be one parallelogram in the given diagram, the answer is shape 4 (parallelogram). \nAnswer: Paralleloogm.\n\n### Input How do you find the circumference of this circle?

The word \"vampire\" is being used as a synonym for \"person\", as in the phrase \"person who needs to drink blood to survive\".\n2. Analyze the words provided in the options to determine a plausible substitute for vampire.\n3. The word \"cheese\" is not typically associated with the word human, and therefore is not a suitable substitution. \n4. \"Stake\" is not a person and therefore cannot be used as a substitution, either. \n5. \"Drink\" is a common word that is used to describe drinking a liquid. This could apply to blood, as it is a liquid, so it can be used as a substitution. \n6. \"Cow\" is a common farm animal that produces milk, which can be drunk as a liquid. This can be used as a plausible substitution.\n7. \"Milk\" is a common food product that can be consumed by humans, making it another plausible substitution. \n8. Therefore, substitutions could be D: cow, E: milk.\n9.

Choices: \n\n### Demostration : If we take a look at a chameleon, we can see that it has two eyes that appear to be separate, but are actually connected in a unique way.

Their eyes are also connected by a thick, pliable tissue, allowing them to turn their heads and shift their view without moving their entire bodies.\n\nThe unique structure of the chameleons eyes also has various advantages, including: \n1. Allows the chameleon a wide-angled view without moving its entire body. \n2. Enables the chameleon' head to turn in any direction without changing the field of view of its eyes individually \n3.

Their expectations were met when they saw 100 parked cars in the front lot. But when the friends got to the back of the parking lot, they saw that there were two times more cars parked there than were parked in the front lot. This would suggest that the theater had more parking spots behind it than in front.\n\n### The sum of the total number of cars is 700. If there are two times more cars out back than there are in the front, that means that there are 700 - 2*100 more cars in the back parking lot than in the front. The theater had two times more parking spaces in the back than in the front, so, therefore, there would have been two times more cars park in the back than in front. The actual number of cars parked in the back lot is the sum of the two numbers, or 1000.\n\n### We can use this to figure out the total number of cars that went inside the theater during the play, which would've been the total number of cars after the parking lot had filled up twice as many. The total number of cars would be 1000 + 2*102, or 3020.

{"text": "7 hours and 4 minutes\n\n### Rationale: There is an answer that requires knowledge that many are looking for.\n\n### How to get it and how to implement:\n1. Determine how one would measure if an alligator walks for an hour or 2 or 7 or....\n\n   The answer is simple if one is a little clever. Let's start the math by observing all the terms in this question:\n\n   \"It took an alligators (sic, not \"alligator\" :D) named Paul  4 hours to walk from [his] home at the River NILE   (sic)   to the NILE Delta.\" Note the capitalization of those terms.\n\n   From this, we see that this question is making a distinction between alligators and a specific alligator named Paul.\n\n   Paul is walking a certain distance from his home at the Nile to the NILE delta. Note the lower case \"n\" for \"Nile,\" which is in contrast to the upper case \"Nile\" of Paul's home.\n\n   Paul's trip takes a certain amount of time, 4 hours in the case of this question. In contrast, the group trip of six alligators takes more time, but the exact amount is not given.\n\n   It is clear that our answer should be in the form of one alligator walking for that specific number of hours.\n\n2. The question is then asking what the combined total time for Paul and the group would be.\n\nWe can make our first attempt to solve this puzzle by simply adding the total amounts of time Paul and the other alligators spent walking.\n\nOur attempt is 4 + 8 = 12 total hours\n\nUnfortunately, this math doesn't make sense because our result is 12 hours which isn't even an approximation of 7.\n\n3. We'll try again, this time breaking each trip from Paul and the group into parts. Let's look at Paul's trip, which took 4 hours.\n\nWe can assume Paul traveled for 1 hour, then walked 1/4 of a mile (4 miles for his trip, divided by 4), then stopped to rest 1/4 (of his hour), then walked 1/2 of a", "answer": " 46"}

This can be seen in the fact that the locations are both written as being \"inside the house\". However, the sentence itself conveys two different ideas: the first describing the state before the window is opened, and the second describing what happens after the window is opened.\nThe phrase \"were closed\" indicates something was previously closed and has changed since it was closed.

{"text": "12 students.\n\n### Reason:\n \nThe following are the choices of students: \n\n - Half the class that plays basketball (50/20 = 2.5)\n - Two out of every fifth volleyball player (20/5 = 4.0)\n - One out of every ten that plays volleyball and basketball (10/2 = 5)\n \nTherefore, the number of students who do not play either game is as follows:\n\n - 50 - 2 * 2.5 - 2 * 4.0 = 12\n \nThus, the number of students that do not play will become 12.\n\n### Solution:\nFirst of all, we make a table to represent the information given in the question.\nWe mark the first class as \"Play basketball\" and each consecutive class as \"TOTAL\",\nand the last class as \"Non-play any games\".\nWe note that there are 20 students playing basketball.\n\nBecause the total number of volleyball players is 20, we add 2 to the class 19 and get 21,\nand we multiply 2 by 4 and get 8.\nThen, we calculate the next class as 2 * 4 +2 as follows.\n\n1/(2 * 4 + 2) = 0.125\nThen, we calculate 0.12 * 21 = 2.424\n\nUsing the last class(19) and the next class(20), we calculate the next class.\n\n2 - (2 + 4) = 0\n2 / 2 = 1\n2 * 1 = 2\n\nBecause we calculate the next class like this (2 * (4/2) - 5/2 = 4 - 2.5),\nwe subtract 2.5 from 4 and get 1.5, and we add it to 5 and get 7.5.\nWe write 125.5 (12 / 9 = 1.389) in the last class.\n\nBecause there are 12 students not playing any game in the last class,\nwe multiply 12 by 9 and obtain it as 1", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "The answer is 40.\n\n### Explanation:The first step is to understand and formulate the problem. In this case, the problem is to determine the number of dozens of do- nots required to raise $96 when each dozen cost $2.40 to purchase and each sold for $1.\n\n\n### The next step is to identify and select one of the options as the best response. Based on the information provided, the options are limited to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 dozen donuts. Considering\nthat each dozen costs $2.40, and each is sold for $1, we know that the profit earned by selling each dozen is equal to $2.4. We also know that the goal is to raise $ 96, which indicates that 32 are required in total, which means that 40 dozens will be sufficient to meet the goal. Therefore, the correct number is 40. \n\n### There are also some common logical fallacies that can be present in problems like this: Ad hominem or 'appeal to person' as in \"But Javier loves donuts, so he'll get the money for sure.\" We also have 'appeal to authority' as in \"My aunt makes a killing with their home business that sells donuts, so I'll definitely make that money.\" A more common case of the logical fallacy is 'appeal to emotion' as in \"If he sells donuts, he will surely reach his goal, after all, he's my best friend!\" All these arguments can be valid in some circumstances, but in the context of this problem, they are not valid, as they do not provide any relevant information.\n\n### The other logical fallacies, such as the 'bandwagon effect' or 'appeal to popularity', or 'appeal to tradition' can also affect this problem. In both cases, these appeal to an authority or a popular consensus without providing relevant information. However, in the context of this example, these would not be a valid or relevant choice.\n\n### There is also the logical fallacy that we call 'ad misericordiam', or 'appeal for pity' in this case.

{"text": "15 cups were drunk\n\n### Instructions:Write a response.\n\n### Note: This can be solved by direct counting or conversion to decimals.\n\n### Rationales: Step 2: The correct answer is the number of cups remaining.\nThis is because the number of cups to be used was equal to the number of cups consumed. \n\nStep 3: The question asks for the number of cups drunk, which implies that the remaining number of cups are still in the party, and there is no additional juice to be considered. \n\nStep3: The remaining number of cups is 0.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the final amount drunk should be 15 cups.\n\nStep4: One solution is to calculate the answer by directly counting the number of cups.\nThis is done by multiplying the number of gallons (10) by the number of cups per gallon (10).\n\nThus, the answer must be either 15 cups or 100 cups. \n\nThis approach is not required, though. \n\nUsing mathematical conversion and rounding, we can also get to the correct answer of 15 cups:\n\n\nStep 5: Since the number of gallons is known, round it down to its lowest number (i.e., the number ending in '5').\n\n\nStep6: The number of cups per one gallon is 10. Since there are 10 cups per one gallons, the number of cups in one gallon becomes 10 x 10 = 100.\n\n\n\nStep 7: Since the number of cups is known to be 100, round it down to the next lowest number (i.\ne., the number ending with '0').\n\nStep 8: Divide the result value with the number of gallons that were drunk (i.e., 5).\n\nStep 9: The result value is the answer of 40 cups, and as mentioned earlier, the minimum value is 15.

After 2 hours the thermometer temperature is 44 degrees. \nHow long will it take until the thermometer is 53 degrees or lower?\n\n### Racionales:\nBecause the thermometer is at the 53 degrees or below after 2 hours, it might take 1.5 hours plus the rest time.  \n1.

{"text": "The statement doesn\u2019t say anything about the rate of growth of the flowers, so let\u2019s simply consider that each flower grows at the same rate. That way, we can use the same formula to determine the number of flowers. We first need to determine how many unicorns are in a row, and then multiply that number by 9 (the length of the path), and divide by 4 (1 per unicorn), to get the number of flowers.\nLet\u2019s first consider the number of unicorns in a row. Each unicorn is traveling at a steady pace of 3 squares at a time. Therefore, the first unicorn must walk at least 3 more squares to meet up with the last unicorn. Since this is a steady pace, there is definitely a second unicorn walking directly behind the first unicorn. There might only be one more unicorn, but in either case, the number of unicrones walking is 2, or a pair. If unicrones are walking side by side, then there must be at least two unicorns, and a third must necessarily be behind the last unicorn (since we know that two unicrones are side by side). If this third unicron is exactly behind the last one, then four flowers will bloom. If there are only two unicrones side by side, there are still four possible locations where the third unicorn can be, and we can multiply this by 9 to get the total number of flowers: <math>2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 9 = 54<math>\n\nIf there are three unicrones side-by-side (which there must be based on the fact that the first two unicrons are side by side, according to our analysis above), then the 3rd unicorn is directly behind the first unicon, there are 3 possible locations for the 4th unicorn, and we can multiply 4 by 9 to get a total of 36 flowers.\n\nTo complete the analysis, we just count backwards.

The question is asking for the total number of beetles eaten if there are six jaguars in the forest. \n\nStep 2. Analyze the given options. \n\nStep1:The number of beetles is directly proportional to the number of jaguars.\nStep 2: Beetle eating behavior is indirectly related to snake eating behavior which itself is indirectly related to jaguar eating behavior. For instance, a jaguar eating 5 snakes in a day means for every 1 snake on a jaguar's diet there are 5 beetles.\nStep 3. Analyze the structure of the answer provided. The answer states the daily number of beetles consumed by six jaguars. One jaguar means 5 beetles, hence, 6 x 5 = 30 beetles.

{"text": "### Answer:\nAll the animals had a total of 52 arms.\n\n### Rationale:\nFirst, the number of animals collected (i.e., 7) is represented by the variable `n`. \nThe variable representing the number of arms of each collected animal is `a`, since each animal has either 5 or 14 arms. \n\nThe `a.sum()` function returns the total number of arms that the animals collected. In this case, the total number of arms should be equal to the sum of the arms possessed by each animal.\n\nSince there are seven animals collected, the total number of stars the animals have to each is `a.sum()`/7 (7 stars each * 5 arms each = 35 arms, so `35/7` = 5). \n\nTo find the number of arms possessed by each animal, multiply the number of arms possessed per animal with the variable `n`.\n\nTherefore, `a.sum()` = 5 * `n`. \nSince, `n` = `7`, `a.sum()`= 5 * `7`, which is equal to `35`.\n\nNext, subtract the number of total arms possessed by each animal (`5 * n`) from the total number of arms returned by the `a.sum()` resultant. In this case, subtracting 5 * `7` = 35 from `35` = 0. \n\nSubtracting the two results in `0- 35`, which equals `0`. Thus, the total of all arms is 0. All the animals collected have a total of 51 arms. \n\nThere is a problem in calculation \n\n### The sum of 7 is -1, total is 52(7 *50 +50*1 +1*14)\n\n###\n\n### Instrucion: Answer the following grad math questions.\n\n###\nDemonstration:\nInput:\\\nCarly collected 7 seashells.\nCarly collected 6 seashells.\nInput:Input:\\\nCarly lost 2 pounds.\nInput:\\\nCarry collected 25 shells.\n\nInput:The total miles that Carly has ran in the past 24 hours are -119.

They are necessary for different reasons, but they are complementary, not competitive.\n\nSpeed is essential in football because it gives players an advantage over their opponents and allows them to make quick decisions, including decisions to pass. On the other hand, stamina is more critical in football because it is vital for players to maintain their energy and pace throughout the game.\n\nFurthermore, stamina is the most vital factor in winning a football match because it allows players to maintain their energy level and pace throughout the game, leading to improved performance and better decision-making. A team with good stamina is likely to have more opportunities to score goals and win the match.\n\nTherefore the answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": " 48"}

This gives us a total of 45 push-ups done. Then, we divide 45 pushups by 15 each set. We get 3 sets or rounds.

So in the crate part of the question, orange can only be in boxes that have orange in it. But in the boxes part of the question, oranges can only be in crates that has orange in it. Let me illustrate this idea by stating:\nIf a box does not have orange, the orange in the crates can be found in another box, that has orange in it, and that box can then be in another box that has orange in it again. So orange can be in 1 box, but in every other box that are found in between 1 crates, there must be at least 1 orange in every box. So the orange can end like a \"chain\", of boxes with orange in it. So we can take an orange from every box that contain orange in it, and we can take one orange from the box that do not contain orange. This orange can be given to every box that contain orange, because the orange in the box can be transferred to another box, where orange can then be transferred. And so on.

Solving this yields x=720.\n\nAnswer: 720 feet of fence need replacement!\n\n### Input (incorrect):The long sides of the plot of private property are three times the length. One short side of a fence is rusted. The fence is sixteen feet wide, with one end attached to the back of the house. The front is covered in flowers. Ten feet of the fence are missing, and the missing area is in the back.\n\n### Response (incorrect):The house has a back, a front, and a left and right side. This information alone tells us that we must be dealing with a rectangular plot of private ron a chain link fence. The long side is three times the other side, meaning its the short side we are looking for. We can find this side by looking at the total length and solving for x:\n\n\nTotal length is 640 feet. We know the long side is 3x and the short side is x-3. This means the length is 3x+x-3, so  x+3 =640.

{"text": "The correct answer is B. The full height of Larry is 6 feet tall, so his height adjustment is 20% of that, or 1 foot (5+1 = 6 feet). By standing on Larry's shoulders 20% shorter (1+1 = 2 feet), 1 foot, Barry is now 1 foot taller (5+2 = 7 feet) than he was before. Larry and Barry are standing on his shoulders 1 foot apart, and therefore can reach apples that 5 feet higher than that 1 foot.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem is worded in a very specific way, and that makes it easily understandable. The first step in solving the problem is to clearly understand the question. The goal of the problem is to determine how high Larry and Barry are standing above the ground, while taking their heights into account. The important components of understanding the problem are to identify the variables (Larry, Barry, the height of their reach, and the size of the apples) and to determine the unknown (the height that Larry and Barry are standing at).\n\nThe problem is asking for information specific to the height that that Larry and Barry are able to reach, rather than the height that each person is individually able to reach. Therefore, it is useful to compare their heights, along with which other characteristics of their height they retain while standing on top of one another.\n\nComparing and contrasting the given details, we can say that Barry can reach apples 5 feet high. This is shown to be sufficient to reach the apples of the tree, but it doesn't tell you how high a reach they can both achieve.\n\nIf Larry is 5 feet short of being able to reach, and his reach, even with the adjustment for should height is still 10% short of being able to meet the criteria for reaching the apples, the answer must be B, since that is the closest of the available options.\n\n### Key Concepts: \n\nIf Larry's full height is 6+1+1 = 8 feet tall, then his height adjustment is based on that, which is 20% or 1 foot.

The problem asks us to determine the answer to the multiplication statement \"1 x 2\", where 1 and 2 are two separate numbers, implying that the answer is either 2 or 0. \n2. Step2: Next, we need to evaluate and eliminate each of the possible answers to see which is most likely to be correct. One of the potential answers is 2, however, 0 is also a possible answer. 3. Step3: Now, evaluating the remaining answers: We can exclude 0 because the multiplication statement includes 2 as a factor, which means any product can't be 0. Therefore, the only possible answer is 2.\n\nRationale B: 2 x 1 is 2\nStep4: The question asks us to compute the multiplication statement \"2 x 1\" for a number 2.

This allows us to relate the width of the sand box to its length by multiplying by a constant in the perimeter (2) and dividing by the length (l2), as shown by\n\n```\nwidth = 2 * 30/l\n```\n\nSince the side lengths of the sandbox are equal to the perimeter, dividing them results in a dimension ratio of the sandboox (length/width), allowing us to write the length and width as equal fractions of a whole number by removing the denominators, as shown by\n\n$$\\frac{2\\times30}{2} = \\Leftrightarrow 15\\times2$$\n\nWith this, we can now calculate the width as shown by 15 feet. \n\nSince this result was found to be equal, we can say the width is 15 feet and the length is equal to the perimeter of 30 feet, making it 21 feet long.", "answer": " 5"}

For the first part of the question about the percentage of books, we can break down the proportion of books in English into two groups: the whole group of books and then the group of English books. \n\n2. The question states that 80% of the books are in English.

Choices: A: oldest B: youngest C: fattest D: meanest E: most skinny\nRationales: This question asks which person among the available options would typically be offered the best food during a meal. \n\nStep 1. Analyze all of the options:\n- OLDEST: Older people are typically served the best food, whether in a formal setting (e.g., a banquet) or an informal setting (e.g. a BBQ) Age is often seen as a factor that confers respect and prestige, and older people are typically treated with more care and politeness.\n- YOUNGEST: Conversely, younger people are usually served the worst food. In the same way age can confer respect, it is also common to see younger people served last in a hierarchy of importance. \n- FATTEST: Fatter people are generally more likely to be offered the best food compared to thinner ones. This is because obesity is often associated with wealth and privilege.\n- MEEST: Generally speaking, the meanest person in any given situation is also offered the best food. The logic here is that a mean person can make life difficult for someone else and therefore deserve to have the best food. \n- MOST SKINNY: On the other hand, the meanest person is usually not offered the best food, as this person is often seen as being difficult and trouble-making.\n\nStep 3. Determine the most probable answer:\n- Based on the analysis, it's safe to say that \"meanest\" (D) is the least likely option.\n- \"Meanest\" is a relatively rare and less common choice when compared to the other available options.\n- On the other hand, \"fat and most skinny\" (E) are more frequent in terms of usage across the web and in everyday life.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is E: most skinny.\n\nAnswer: E: most skinny", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "The answer is 12. \nInput: There are 832 students at the college, over 20% of them are women. They took two quizzes where there were nine questions each. They took six questions on one and five on the other for an overall average of 70%. How many women took each quiz?\n\n### Solution: The problem needs two calculations, one to find the percentage of women, and another on the number of each question answered. \n\nThe percentage of women is calculated by taking 20% * 832/100, which is 167. \n\nThe question then wants to find out how many women took each quizz, and for each how many question were answered. We need two calculations to complete this question: First, we determine which quizz one woman took (2/3). Then, we divide that number by the number of question the womens took, and multiply it by 2. \n\nThe answer to the first calculation is 167 women answered questions, and each of them took five questions. But 2/3 means each did six questions, so the answer is 6 with a remainder of three. The restatement formula requires dividing the remainder by two and multiplying it by two (the divisor). Rearranging the equation gives 6 + 3 * 2, which is the correct answer of 9. \n\nThere are therefore 832 women, with 9 women taking each quiz and 167 answering questions. With the answer for one quiz, we can simply subtract the number of questions answered for the second quiz to get the correct value of five, the answer to the second quizz. \nHence, the solution is: There are 860 women and five women took the second quiz. \nAnswer: 860 women", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "Square tables needed: 9: Answer: 9\n\n### Demostration:Input: What will they buy? Choices: A: food B: clothing C: furniture\nRationales: First of all, it is obvious to eliminate food (choice A) as an option since it's impossible to buy food with money. So, the remaining choices will include clothing (choice B) and furniture(choice C).Furniture is an outdoor or indoor accessory, often made from wood, metal, or some other material. The key question is would someone purchase furniture or clothing? Well, when it comes to clothing, it is usually purchased based on style and need, for example a person may like the design of a new pair of shoes, so they will purchase it. On the other hand in case of furniture it is not purchased frequently as well as needed. Moreover, in most homes, there is usually lots of furniture, so the odds of purchasing a furniture item is quite low compared to clothing.  In conclusion, clothing is more likely to be purchased than furniture, hence choosing clothing (choice B).\n\nInput: How many times did the cat meow when it was being stroked? Choices: 7:A: 1 time B: 3 times C: 45 times D: 13 times E: 25 times\nRationales: This sentence implies that there is a person that is being observed that has a cat being stroked while they are meowing. There are 6 items in the list of choices, so one of the choices should be different from the others because it represents a less frequent occurance.\nThe cat would be meowing at a less frequent rate when it is being stroked than when it is not stroked. The list of choices makes this difficult to determine, but this can be deduced by thinking of the sentence in terms of how many meowing sessions were there in terms of stroking.\nThere are two options that should be unlikely to be selected: the cat was stroked 13 (Choice D) or 25 (Choice E) times. It's very rare that a cat would be stroked that many times, so they are unlikely to be correct. This leaves us with choices of B, which is the cat being stroked", "answer": " 5"}

Choices: A: Being B: Happening C: Previous D: Future E: Nonexistent\nRationales: At its most basic, the word \"existing\" describes the state of being. It means \"to have an objectively real existence rather than to be imagined or only possible.\" It is often used in reference to objects or things rather than people or things, and it implies that the object is already in existence rather than anticipated or expected. \n\n1. The first step in answering this question is to understand the context of the word \u201cexisting\u201d. \n\n2.

{"text": "(18) * 6 + 4 = 112 hours\n\n### Demostration:\n1. We can start by converting time units.\n   We know that each audiobook is 30 hours long.\n\n   To convert this unit of time, take 30 and multiply it by the speed factor of 1000 to get a unit of time in seconds.\n   The time unit is equal to 300000, which we will refer to as one day.\n\n2. So far, we converted one hour of listening to an audiobook into one day of use.\n\n3. We are now calculating how long it takes to listen to each audiobook.\n\n   Since each audiobook is 150 minutes long, we can simplify the solution by just multiplying these and finding what one day equals.\n\n   A one day equivalency equals 66 minutes.\n\n4. Now we know that Fernanda listened to 12 hours a day, and that she had 6 audiobooks that took 12 hours each to listen to.\n\n   Therefore, she ended up listening to 12 hours times 6 books, or 72 hours in all.\n\n5. To sum the total time consumed by all six books, we multiply 72 by 6 to get 432 hours.\n\n6. We already know that Fernanda listened for 12 hours a days for 6 days, which totals 72 hours.\n\n   Because Fernanda listened for 2 hours a day for 18 days, we can simply subtract the 72 hours she listened to each day for the first 6 days, to get the remaining time.\n\n   This remaining time is equal to 45 days, and we can multiply it by 6 to equal 270 days.\n\n7. We have 432 as the total time for the audiobooks and 271 as the total time for listening, resulting in a grand total of 703 hours.\n\n8. One book lasts 150 minutes, which is equal to two hours in the context of the problem.\n\n9. To solve this, we must multiply the total time by the book duration to obtain the answer.\n\n   The answer is found to be 151500", "answer": " 90"}

It's likely that one would use a cutting tool at some point when styling their hair. The phrase \"probably doing\" gives some uncertainty. If that's their regular routine, it could be a possible answer. However, if they are simply doing a quick \"do\" or style, it's unlikely they'd be cutting their hair.\n\nOption 2: Waving. Perhaps one might use their hand to wave their hair to get it to move. However, if there is a need to style the hair, this means that most people don't have any need to wave their hair.\n\nThe rest of the options are less plausible as they indicate a need to add a product to the hair, but there's no indication that they are doing that.\n\nIn summary, there is no indication that the person is applying anything to their hair. Instead, they're styling it, whether by cutting, brushing, or brushing. \n\nOption: D: Brushing. This is likely the best answer as brushing the hair is a common styling method that is used for many styles.

Can you use the balanced meal rule to determine how many sandwiches, potato pieces, and fruit cups you should buy to create a balanced meal?\n\n### Demostration: \n\n1. First, we want to understand what the question asks. Essentially, it wants to know whether we can use the balanced meals rule to determine how many of each item one should have in order to have a balanced meal with the items one has chosen to buy (sandwiches, potatoes and fruit)\n2. Now, let\u2019s interpret the answer choices to determine if they can be used to find the answer to this question.\n3. In order to use the balanced meas rule to determine how many, we need to know how many sandwiches we should buy, as well as the number of pieces of potatoes and numbers of fruit cups we should buy.\n4. Option A: the answer doesn\u2019t specify the number of sandwiches we are supposed to buy. Unless we already know the number of sandwich we are supposed to buy, we can\u2019t use the balanced mea rule to determine how many we should buy. Hence, A: can\u2019t be used to find the answers.\n5. Option B: the answer doesn\u2019s specify the number of pieces of pots or number of fruit cups. If we cannot determine those numbers, we also cannot know the number of sandwhich to buy either. Hence, B: can\u2019t be use to find the answers either.\n6. Option C: tells us we can eat more than one fruit. This means we can eat any number of fruit cups, which is what we need to find in order to determine the answer. \n7. Since we can eat more than once, there is no limit  to the number of fruit cups on our plate.

To start I figured out the times by solving 42/4 = 10.55 then multiplied by 2.5 so that Amoli was traveling at 10.5 mph. I then followed the same process for Anayet and came out with 69.25 for their time.\n\n### Rationales: This is based on how many miles are needed if a car is traveling at 1/2 mile an hour then I used the equation M=2*D / ((T + T2) / 2) where D = 369, T / T2 = 3/2, M = 810. If a car is traveling 3 mph then (T + T2)/2 = 4.5, then I would use the equation M = D/(T + T2)/(T1 + T2).\n\n### Input:\"The man who caught The Loch Ness Monster!\" said the girl. \"Why do you think he called me?\" said The Nessie?\n\n### Demostration:\n1. First, understand what the man said to the girl:\"The man who caught the Loch Ness Monter\" suggests that the man is a fisherman and the girl is referring to him. The reference to \"Nessie\" in the answer choice is confusing because Nessie is not a particular name, so we would probably choose the option that uses a different name.\n2.  This eliminates E: \"Rex\" and D: \"Dave\".\n3. B: \"The Cretan\" is the only option that is still compatible with both the question and answer choices, which indicates that the man's name is \"The Cretan\".\n4. The girl's question, \"Why do you think I would call you?\" is a confusing question because it is unclear what the girl is asking. The question seems to indicate that the man was not expecting a phone call from \"The Cretan\", which contradicts the statement \"The man who caught the\nLoch Ness Monster\".\n5.

We can start with the solution with the least requirement.\n\nWe can notice that Ferris Wheel costs 1 ticket less, meaning if we have 2 tickets, it can be equal to the Ferris Wheel.\n\nWe can have a Ferris Wheel. Now, let's add another ticket and solve it again.\n\nWe can see that it goes back to the Ferris WEll.\n\nIt means, for us to get the Ferris Wheel, we only need 1 ticket.\n\nWe can eliminate the options that give us Ferris WEll with less cost. \n\nNow, let's think about the Ferris Wheel and roller coaster. The cost of Ferris Wheel is 5 tickets, and the cost of roller coaster is 4 tickets.\n\nWhat's the least requirement for roller coaster? If we buy the roller coaster that costs 4 tickets, the rest of the number is more than it costs, so, we can say it's 1 ticket.\nIt means, Ferris WEll costs 2 tickets less.\n\nThe roller costs, 4 tickets. It has to have a ticket that costs 4 tickers.\n\nThe rolller coaster is equal to having no Ferris WEll, Ferris WELL has 1 ticket.\n \n Now, as you see, we can save another ticket, it's 1. We can save an additional amount of tickets, it means, you have to add how much is it between the Ferris WELL and roller coaster? Ferris WEll is 1 ticket, roller coaster is the 2nd ticket, so, it needs the difference between the Ferris Well and roller coaster: which is 1 ticket.  \n \n We can have the Ferris WEell, the Ferris WEEL costs 1 ticket.\n But, we have to buy the Ferris WEall for 5 tickets, it's 4 tickets.

Prepare the data by isolating the variable and the variables.\nSince the question involves an Arithmetic Word Problem, we must prepare relevant data before attempting to form a suitable response.\n\nTo do so, we isolate out the value of `1` since it refers to the variable of `Mariel`.\n\nIsolate the other variable, the number of dog legs (here, `36`) from the remainder of the sentence.\n\nThis leaves us with:\n\n\\begin{code}\nMariel walks her dog pack.

Then we have 189 - 10 = 199 left over, so she should always have the same amount of pets left over.\n\nStep 9. Therefore 199 divided by an unknown amount of pets = 199 / x = 199/x =127/x.\n\nStep 5. Since the answer is divisible by 127, it must be even.\n\nStep 8. Next we subtract the number of dogs from the number of pets Heloise would have left, which should be even.\n\nWe then multiply by 2.\n\nStep 4. The question asks for the number of dogs she would have left, so we simply subtract the number of dogs to the number of pets, then multiply by 2\n\nStep 7. The next step is subtraction, followed by division.

{"text": "The total mass of fruit harvest from fruit in the orchard equals 187,500 kg.\n\n### Rationalis\n1. The first step in the solution is to identify the key information in the sentence. The key information in this sentence is that 30 apple trees give an average of 150 kg and 45 peaches give an average of 60 kg (65). Since we are given the orchard's annual yield, we know the total yield of the orchard every year is determined.\n\n2. We then need to identify what we already know about the orchard. In this case, we know that there are 30 apple trees and 50 fruit. What are the mass of the orchard? 30 \u00d7 150= 4500 kg of apples mass and therefore there 45 trees. And since we get 750 kg of appliances the total mass of apples harvested is 3000 kg.\n3. Once we know the mass of apples and apples, we need to identify what we know about the harvest. In this case, 2,950 kg of appellations are harvested and 19 kg of peacocks are harvested, so 33,325 kg in all orchards.\n4. The final step is to determine what we should conclude. Based on our knowledge, we conclude that the total mass of food harvested from the orchard is 187,750 kg.\n\nIn this puzzle, all the information we have about the orchard's yield is in this sentence. After that, we can use the knowledge that is provided to us to work through a solution that is accurate and makes sense.\n\n### Input:\"The boy ate an entire box of donuts and then he drank several energy drinks.\"\n1.

{"text": "The grill ran for twelve minutes. \n\n### Rationales:1. The question asks \"how long did the grillrun?\"\n2. We need to find the total number of coals that would need to be burned in the charcoal grill. \n3. The question gives us the rate of burning coals (15 coals -> 1 bag every 20 mins), and the total number of bags that need to be burned (3 bags). \n4. The total number of coals burned can be calculated from the rate of burning coaldaily + total numberofbags (3bags) - the difference between total number of coals and the total number of coaldaily.\n5. We can find the total number of colldaily by taking the rate of burning coalevery 20mins - the total number of bages burned in the given time.\n6. Then, we need the difference between the number of coals daily and the total number of them at the end. In our case, 5040 - (2*300). \n7. So, we can find out the total number of coales daily by using the rate of burning colldaily - the total number of coalsexpected after one grilling time of 12 minutes.\n8. As we know both of these things, we can calculate the amount of colldaily, 1904.\n9. To find the amount of coals after a grilling time of 20, we can deduct the expected amount of colldaily (1904) from the total number of coalandburned(15040) - the difference is 13,136.\n10. To find the number of minutes this grilling time took, we can convert the number of coals to ash (which is a rate equivalent of 12 min) - the expected amount of 20 minutes.\n11.

This means that we are looking for an object that is used to place shoes on someone, rather than an actual shoe or item of footwear.\n- The most likely key to identifying the answer is to look for words such as \"put them on or into\" or \"place them on or into\" which can indicate that the object is used in relation to putting on shoes.\n- In this case, the correct answer would likely be one that allows someone to put their shoes onto themselves, such as a \"shoe rack\" or a \"table.\" Any of the other choices are either not relevant to the context of the question or they relate to things that do not allow for the placement of shoes directly onto the individual.\n\n### Step 2: Transition from Key Information to Relevant Knowledge\n\n- In this stage, the goal is to transition from identifying the key information presented by the question to the relevant and applicable knowledge that is required to accurately answer it.\n- One approach is to consider any of the other choices that may not be correct and determine whether any of them could be considered likely or unlikely.\n- This technique can be useful in eliminating any incorrect options or narrowing down the choice to one that seems more probable or likely. Another technique for determining the most likely answer is to consider the context and background of the question and determine any additional items or objects that would be present.\n\n### Final Stage: Connecting to Answer\n\n- The final stage is to connect the relevant knowledge to the key information provided in the question.\n- In this step, it is important to note the specific wording used in the question, such as \"a tree\" or \"a bed\" since this will help to eliminate any incorrect choices.\n- Once the correct choice is identified, the answer can be provided", "answer": " 15"}

Choices: 21:A: celebrate with pink cake 18:B: celebrate with red cake 4:C: have a quiet evening 4:D: throw party 6:E: throw surprise party\nRationales:The question asks the reader to solve which activity they are likely to do to celebrate a birthday party?\nStep 1: The first step is to interpret the statement, specifically to make sense of the term \"pink cake\" which does not actually make sense because pink does not usually describe cakes, rather it refers to the person themselves. \nStep 2. The given answers are as follows: 1: (21:21) (A: Celebrate with pink cakes. 18: (18:18) (B: Celebrate With red cakes. 4:(4:4) (C:Have a quiet evening. 4: (4:4) (D:Throw a party. 6: (6:6) (E:Throw a surprise party.)\nStep 3. After interpreting the answers based on the given statements, we can conclude the following: 1. (21:27) is incorrect as we cannot celebrate with pink and red cakes because it makes no sense. This also applies to (18:12).\n2. (29:17) would be reasonable to believe one might celebrate with a cake as cakes are typically associated with celebrations. \n3. (18:13) would also be a reasonable answer as a person might decide to have a nice quiet evening with a friend.\n4. (4:4) is a plausible answer as the person could throw a party. Also, (4:7) is not probable as it would be too little money to throw a party.\n5. (6:6) is a possible answer as the person might throw a surprise party if they had no plans at all.\nStep 4.

{"text": "$250.00\n\n### Rationale:\nStep 1: \n1. James gets $20 an hour at his main job. Since this is the main job, we consider this first as our starting point. \n\nStep 2 \n2. James earns $20% less while at his second job. $2.00 an hour is $20 percent of $20, so James makes $18 an hour at his second job. By the basic maths, \n\nStep 3 \n3. He works half-time at his second job. Therefore he works 30/2 = 15 hours at his second job. \n\nStep 4 \n4. Finally he adds these two together. Adding $25 an hour (main job) and $18 an hour (second job), he gets a total of  $43 an hour. He works 40 hours a week for a total pay of $43 x 40 = $1,720.00 \n\n5. Multiplying this number by 52 (how many weeks in the year), we get a grand total which equals $92,160.00.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs per these instructions, this question is to be answered by showing a rational approach.\n\n1. To determine the main job. It is important to understand how to determine the main job here. The question suggests that the second job is half the amount of time as the first one and at a lower rate. Therefore, the earner is spending half his time at his main job and he works 50% of regular time at his second one. This means, the man spends half his time at the main job and the other half of the time is spent at work (second job). This is in support of considering the main job first.\n2. Income tax. The tax deduction is not considered in this scenario, as the question does not refer to any tax-related issue.\n3. Hours worked. It is crucial to understand this is a question of rational calculation. The question doesn't refer to any calculation or calculation with the unit involved.\n4.

To determine if a state is probable for an individual in the current context, we consider the possible effects of the following three factors: \u25a0\u25a0 Situational \u25a0\u25a0 Subjective factors \u25a0\u25a0 Temporal\n\n\n### Situational: Does the situation make the behavior likely? A situation could refer to a physical or emotional condition, other participants or individuals, or circumstances such as weather or illumination. \n\nIf the situation is one that is likely to produce the state of mind given, it will be considered a situational factor. \n\nIf it is unlikely to produce the state under consideration, it will be considered not to be a situational factor.\n\n\n### Subjective factors: If the state of mind is one that the speaker can choose, there will be subjective factors that are contributing to its potential existence. \n\nThese could be feelings, beliefs, attitudes, or past experiences that are impacting the individual\u2019s state of mind. \n\nIf this is the case, it will be considered an objective factor. \n\nOtherwise, it will be considered as not an objective factor.\n\n\n#### Temporal: States of mind can be either temporary or permanent. A permanent state of mind is one which is unlikely to be changed for the duration of the conversation, event, occasion, or situation under consideration. \n\nA temporary state of mind can change and be different between one moment or conversation to the next. \n\nTo determine if a state of mind is temporary or permanent, we consider the following indicators: \u25a0\u25a0 Contextual expectations \u25a0\u25a0 Contrasting outcomes\n\nA state of mind is likely to be temporary if it meets both of these indicators.

{"text": "I drive and take a bus to work. For the same reason, I take a bus and I'll drive to work. The answer is 3. Which is three.\n\n### Rationale:\n**The statement of the question:**\nIt is given that 60% of the people who aren't driving are being taken by a bus. These 60% people drive to get in the bus to get to their work. Since this group of people has only 50% people who take the bus and drive. So, it is given that 10% of the people drive to the bus station instead of using a bus. Therefore, it can be said that 40% drive to work, as other than 30% who drive.  \n\n**Analyzing the four options:**\nWe can identify possible answers from the given options. We must decide what is the case that doesn't match with the given facts. So, it's clear that 60% choose to go by car from work.  It is shown in the given data that 30 are using a bus.  The remaining 8% of them were taking a different option.  Since they were using a train, it can be concluded that the remaining 8% used that. The second option from the choices is given that the bus transports only 50% of the workers who don't drive on their own. It can be said that the remaining 30% of the work force use cars to get there.\n\n**The correct answer is:**\n2. The conclusion is that among those who drive to work, 40% don't take a bus to work, and among those who don't drive, 60% take a bus to work = 40 + 0.6*0.5 = 0.6*1.5 = 0,9 < 1 \nSo, the question is, what is a logical approach that can be taken to reach that logical solution?\n\n### Solution:\n\n> **1-0.6 * 1,5 = 0,6x1,5 = 10%**\n>\n>\n> **2-0.5*1.5 =?**\n>\n> Thus, we conclude that more than the 30% of employees drive to work.", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "Jake is left with $750.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. Jake has $50,000. This is the total amount of money available to him.\n\n2. To buy a motorcycle, Jake needs to spend at least $8,000. He also does not have enough money left to spend half of what's not left on a concert ticket, so he instead spends less than half.\n\n3. After spending $2800 to buy a motorcycle, he loses $1200. $8k + $2800 = $10,800, while $2800 x 0.25 = $720. So he loses $560.\n\n4. Because of the expenses we've already calculated, he is left with $1000 - $560 - $563 = $297 and change.\n\n5. Finally, of the $297 and a change, he loses another $513. 297 + 513 = 810, so he is left with $810.01.\n\n### Input : A group of people are waiting at the train station to leave.

{"text": "The actual distance between the two towns is approximately 15.18 miles.\n\n### Justification: The given statement gives the relationship between actual distance and 1/4-inch distance on the map. In this case, 3 3/12 inches represent 8 miles using the given scale. Therefore, we can deduce that:\n```\n1/4-inch = 8 miles x (3+3/12)/(3+3/11)\n```\nIncluding the constant 8 (for miles) and substituting for x, we get:\n```\n16/4 = 8 x (3+3\u204412)/(3\u20443) = 8(3+3\u204424)/3 = 24\u204424\n```\n\nand, hence,\n```\n1/32 = (24/24) * (3/4) ==>  (32) = (48) ==> 27 = 48, and  32 = 48 ==>  (48) =\n``` and (48 = 27) ==> 72 is a whole number to subtract, making the number of miles between the two towns to be approximately 15.2\n\n### Other Example:- \n```\n15230.2/6 = x (585/36) ==> 43 = (36) ==> 36 = 36 ==> x = (6) ==> x = 6\n```\n\nand x = 6\n\n###\n**Reference** (1) [Problem Solving Questions for ACCUPLACER](https://www.accuplacer.org/support/prepare/sample-questions/) (2) [Grammar Skills Questions for ACC UPLACER] (https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/accuplacer/eas/grammar/4/3-sample-questions)", "answer": " 108"}

After she passed through the intersection, she turned right as there was a traffic light, and she realized that her right-hand had gone numb.\nWhile she was examining her hand, she saw two ambulances and people rushing to the accident site. Rebecca then realized that she had collided with a man who had a head that had a serious injury after crossing the street. \n\nRebecca's brother John saw her hand and asked if she was ok. She replied that she was a little shaken after seeing the accident. While walking away, Rebecca saw a girl holding an ice cream in her right hand. \n\nRationales: Rebecca's brother was holding her left hand as she walked and asked if she was OK. He noticed her hand was numb. After seeing the accident, she felt shaken. And as she walked away, she saw a girl holding an Ice Cream in her right hand.\n\nThis implies that Rebecca's hand went numb and became more cold when she collided with the victim.

Adding those three together reveals a water need of 120 gallons for every acre, or 512 gallons for every 5 acres of corn, as there are 5 acres of corn. Farmer Bernie's farm is 2 acres of corn, as mentioned, and 120 gallon per acre water usage for cotton, resulting in a total water usage of 240 gallons an acre. The total farming areas of Farmer Bob, Brenda, and Bernie are 4 acres of corn, 54 acres of corn, and 2 acres of corn. 3 acres of corn would be the portion of the total farming area for corn, with an additional water input of 512 gallon/acre and an overall total of 1536 gallons for every 3 acres of corn. 12 acres of corn would result in water usage of 1824 gallons, given the parameters of the system design mentioned in the question.

A: a tsunami does not have a wave like a tidal wave.  B: a tsunami is a series of waves that moves faster than a tidal wave. Also, a tsunami is created by displacement of the seabed and can be triggered by earthquakes below the sea.  A tire is a series of wave that moves faster than a high tide.  C: a tsunami can be detected by radar or earthquake records which are not the case with a tidal wave. It also moves at fast speed, unlike a tidal wave. D: a tsunami needs to be a series of wave which can be triggered by earth quake.  E: a tsunami and tidalwave are the same which is not true.\n\nStep 3, analyse all the information and draw the Conclusion.  The answer is E: a tsunamai and it tidal wave are different because a tsunami is not a series of waves that move faster than a tidalwave which is triggered by Earth quake. It also moves at low speed.\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1: The question asks if there are any ways to tell the two apart and provides several options as plausible methods.\nStep 2: We consider all the options and evaluate them based on the information provided in the question. For example, we consider the method of looking at records to determine if a tsunami was caused by an earthquake, which would be more likely on record in the case of a tsunami rather than a tidal wave due to their different causes.\nStep 3: Based on the evaluation, we can determine that the best answer is E: a tidal wave and a tsunami are different due to their different causes and different effects on the water.", "answer": " 60"}

After that, she wa\u200cshes the towels. If it took 30 minu\u200ctes to wa\u200csh the clothes and Naomi takes 1/3 of the time (the number of minutes it took to wash the clothes) to wash the towels (30min/3=10min), then it w\u200could take 40 minutes to wa\u200csh the towels. So Naomi must add another 10 minutes to all this to wa\u200csh one full cycle. So in the second cycle, Naomi must wash 15 minutes less than this (Naomi only wa\u200cshes 15 minutes). So d\u200curing the second cycle, Naomis towa\u200cls will take 40 minutes as it already took her d\u200curing the first cycle. The sheets will take 30 minutes as Naomi is w\u200cashing the clothes a\u200cnd towa\u200cls towa\u200cls. So if clothes take 21 minu\u200cte\u200cs to wa\u200csh and towa\u200cls take 40 m\u200cinute\u200cs to wa\u200cash then sheets take 30 minutes. So Naomi wa\u200chers everything d\u200curing the following cycle.\nSince the sheets take 15 minu\u200ctes less, then the gentle w\u200cash cycle would take longer. So her clothes would take d\u200cefinitely less time during the next cycle as compared to the first two cycles. So the clothes will take 20 minu\u200ctes. This is the answer. So since all of them are d\u200cone d\u200curing one cycle then her time duration is the sum of them d\u200curing one cycle. \n21+40+30=20\nThe sheet takes 15 minu**s less compared to the two previous cycles, hence the clothes need more time to wash.

Therefore she is carrying 40 pounds after 6 hours of walking.\n\nAnswer:\n40 pounds\n\n### Demystification\n\nFirst, we need to determine what the question is asking and understand the concept behind the scenario.\n\n\"packs 20 pounds...\" is a list of items Karen is taking with her. This information leads to the concept of the formula: P = M + W, where M is the weight of the gear brought, W is the weight of water/food/other items (30 pounds).\n\n\"during the hike, she drink 2 pounds of water..\" indicates that during the walk, Karen is drinking 2 pounds to a full 6 hours. From this phrase, we conclude that x, the number of hours she walked, hours = (10+10-x)/2\n\n\"... and eats the weight of food per pound as water\" means that while Karen is drinking water at the rate of 2 pounds per hour, she also eats 1/x pound of water.\n\n\"She is carrying 40 Pounds of (...)\" means that after 6 hours of hike, the weight Karen is carrying is 40 Pounds.\n\nAll this gives us the formula: P = (M + w) x h = 60 / 2 (10 + 10 - x)\n\nThen solving the linear equation: P = 60 / (2)(10 + 1 to - x) yields P = 40 as the solution by simplifying\n\nAnswer: \n40 pounds", "answer": " 34"}

How many serves does an average player make in a match where they win 6 sets of 6 games?\n\n### Solution:The player will win 1 set, so, the player will make (6x7) serves.\n\n### Reasoning:In this question, we use the fact that each set in a tennis match consists of 6 games, and the player plays 7 serves in each game. Hence we multiply the number of games in a set by the number of serves the player makes per game to calculate the number of serves in each set. This means that the player will make (123) serves per set. Since the player wins 6 sets in one match, the total number of serves the player will make in the match is simply 6 sets: (123)(6).\n\n### Verbal Reasoning:What is the correct definition of the phrase \"exceeded greatly?\"\n\n### Solution\n\nThe phrase \"exceeded to greatly\" could mean that the player won the game with a score that was higher than usual, or even won the game by a large margin. It could also mean that the player won many games in a row, making their overall score exceed significantly. 72 hours seems to be a long period of time, and so the phrase could be referring to a high score.", "answer": " 12834"}

He initially drives 30 mpg for half an hour, leaving a remaining distance of half an hour. \n\nHowever, he soon doubles his speed, reducing the remaining time by half. \n\nThere are two possible speeds he could be traveling at, based on his current speed: 60 mph and 120 mph. \n\nBoth of these speeds can cover the remaining distance of 30 mpg in a remaining time of half an hour. Hence, any of these two options would work. \n\nStep 2&3 Step 2: We will first assume James is driving 120 mpg. If so, this means the remaining time, 30 mpg, is 3 seconds and hence the distance is 3/600 = 0.05 km. \n\nStep3: If James is traveling at 60 mpg, however, this would mean the remaining time would be 2 minutes and hence the distance would be 2/600 =0.0333  km. \n\nBased on the above calculations, the distance James drives is 0.033 km at 60 mph, and 0.050 km at 120 m/h.\n\nStep 4: James' distance is 0.05 and 0.03 in km/h. \n\nStep5: As there are 1000 m/h in a km, this means his total distance in km is 0.5 and 0.3 in km. \n\nThereafter, we can state that the total distance James drives in mi is therefore 5 miles. \n\nHope this helps! \n\nAnswer: 8.50%\n\n\nA.I.B.C.A", "answer": " 75"}
{"text": "### Demostration:\nIn the question, Elyse can carry 30 baggage using 3 trips. In case of her brother, he can also carry 30 bagger using 3 trips,\n\n### Rationales:\nThere are various possible approaches to answer this question.\n#### Option A: If we follow the logic that Elyse can carry three bags in one trip, then thirty bags will require nine trips to be carried. This answer does not take into account Elyse's partner or the number of bags he can carry during each trip. Also, the question does not specify the weight of each bag, so it is possible that Elyse and her brother could carry the same amount of groceries in one trip.\n#### Option B: One possible solution is to assume that Elyse and his brother can each carry forty bags. This would require just two trips, making each trip about 17 bags. However, this method does not take into account that they may need to split their trips between them.\n#### Option C: Alternately, we could assume that each bagger can carry 30 kg. With this assumption, Elyse could carry 210 kg and her brother could carry 215 kg in one trip, reducing the number of required trips to just over two. This method takes into account that they may share some of the bags but does not take into account the size of the bags themselves \n#### Option D: The last approach is to assume that each baggage is medium-size (20kg), with Elyse and her partner carrying 29 bags and their brother carrying 20. This requires two trips, one with Elyse and his partner, and one with him alone. Although this method assumes that some bags go unshared, their total weight is greater than 30 kg, making this approach not as advantageous as the previous ones.\n\nAs a result, the only solution that fits all requirements is option A, which states that Elyse and the brother can each carry 30 bakers to the home in three trips. This follows the logic outlined earlier, assuming that they can each carry a total of 30 bags in each trip.

It helps prevent its core from drying out.\nOption B: use olive: oil: it's a cooking oil with high smoke point, which prevents it from burning and makes it ideal for cooking meat like turkey. A higher smoke point also makes it less likely to leave behind harmful compounds.\nOption C: use peanuts: peanut oil has a high smoke point, just as olive oil does, plus it leaves a nutty, mild taste in the turkey.\nOption D: Turkey brush: using a brush or a basting turkey helps moisture escape during the cooking process. When turkeys are basted and not stuffed, using a brush or basting turkey allows for the distribution of juices and other liquids evenly through the meat. This ensures that the turkey stays moist and flavorful over the course of the cooking process.\nOption E: use a broom for flavor: using olive oil or peanut oil may improve the taste and flavor of the turkey, but a broom of another flavor will improve the taste more.

The total of both days is therefore 60+60=120  \n\nTherefore, Tanika sold 120 boxes in total.\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst, we start by regrouping the sentence for emphasis on what is important and to remove unnecessary details:\n\n> Tanika is selling boxes for her scout troope's fund-raising efforts. She sold 60 boxes on Saturday and ended the day with $705 in cash. She sold 50% of her boxes on Sunday and walked away with $353 in earnings.\n\nThis removes \"cracker\" since it does not matter what kind of cracker she sells.\n\nNext, for each day, we break the sentence apart in a table:\n\nDay | Sat | Number of Boxes | Total Earnings\n---|----|-------------------|--------------------\n| 60 | \n<img src=\"assets/screenshots/sales-table.png\"/>\nThe total number of boxes sold in Day 2 (50%) is 60.\nSo the number of boxes sold to start Day 1 is 60.  \nThe total number of days sold is therefore Day 1 is 120 boxes; 60 in Day 1, plus 60 in Day2.\n\nThen we sum up the cash at the end of each day to find the total cash earned:\n\nDay 1 | $705\nDay 2 | $353\n\nThus Tanika sold 133 boxes over the two days and earned $1,058.\nNext, we plug the numbers in the table as follows:\n\nDay 2 is 2/3 or 50% of Day 1.\n\nThus the total number of boxes sold on Day 2 is 60x50%=30 boxes\n\nThe total number of sales on Day 1 is 30 boxes + 60 boxes + 63 boxes for a day total of 12", "answer": " 150"}

While the activities mentioned in the options do not necessarily have to happen after dinner, they can be completed in the \"evening\" as well, they all make sense as post-dinner activities.\n Step 2: Next, it is important to identify the listener who is asking for input in an activity. \n In this case, it turns out that it is the person being asked by someone else about the post-dinner activity. \n So, the listener is the one offering their choice to the person doing the asking as an option, implying that there is a discussion in process to decide on an activity instead of just making a choice on their own. \n Step 3: The listener has various choices available. Each choice refers to a possible activity to do after the meal. \n These options range from cultural activities to leisurely activities that people enjoy doing together. \n Step 4: Using the available information, we can start eliminating the options. \n Option A: \"Go to theatre\" does not make sense as a post-dinner activity, as it is usually done during the day, not at night. \n Option B: \"Watch comedy\", is not a suitable choice as the context doesn't support the idea of someone wanting to go to", "answer": " 12"}

In this case, if the length is four times the width, you can find the length by finding the width and multiplying it by four. So, to find the length, you can either multiply the width by four and use the answer or simply find the width.\nNow, use the width to find the entire rectangle or use the entire rectangle to find the width. Using the width to find the rectangle, you multiply four times the width to the area of the rectangle to find the length.\nIn this case, if the area is 120 m2, the length of the rectangle is 4 m.

This means, if Amber worked a total of 12 hours, Armand and Ella probably each worked roughly 24 hours. If that was the case, the total working hours will be 12+24+12 or 58 total. \n\nLet's use the following equation to solve -\n```\n  12 + (2/3) * 12 + (2*2/3) *12\n```\nThe above equation should be interpreted as 12+8+24 since the units of every term are in hours. We're trying to determine the sum of the time each worked i.e. 12+8=20. This value works out to be 34 when divided by 3. \n\n```\n(2/3) + (2*2) + (2/3)*12 = 12 + 24 + 3\n``` \nBy using the same equation, we can derive that Ella worked for 8 hours. For Armand's contribution, we don't know exactly how much since he only worked for 3/7 of the time, but we can assume that 2/7 or 2/3rds of 12 hours. To summarize, we know Amber worked for 100% or 12 hours in total, and Ella worked 8 hours. Armand's work is 8/3rds or 26.2 hours. Putting this together we know Amber worked 100%, Ella worked 80%, and Armand worked 40%.

First, let us write down the equation that describes how many more dogs Ben has than Teddy:\n\n`13 > 7`\n\n    Hence, Ben has 13 more dogs than Teddy.\n2. Next, write down the equation that determines how many fewer dogs Dave has than Teddy: \n\n`5 > 7`\n3. Now the total number of Teddy's dogs, Ben's dogs, and Dave's dogs, expressed mathematically.\n\n`13*1 + 8 + 9`, where `13, 8, 9` are respectively the number of dogs Ben, Teddy, and Dave have.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of Ben's, Teddy's, and Dave's cats can be written as `19*2 + 5 + 8`, where `19, 8, 5` are respectively the number  cats Ben, Teddy, Dave has. Let us also write the total number of pets in the question as:\n\n`79*3`,  where `79` is how many pets all 3 of them add up. \n\n4. We also can express the total number of cats and dogs in one term since they are on the same side of the equal sign, i.e. `79cats+79dogs`, but also `cats+dogs`.\n`79(cat+dog)`\n\n5. Now we will have `82pet = 79(cats+dogs) - 79cats9 - 8 + 9`\n\n6. Let us express this as an equation: `7*8 = cats + dog - pets - 9`.\n\n7. The equation can be further simplified to `8 = (-pets + pets) - 9` which is equivalent to `8 = -9 + pets`.\n\n8. And then, to eliminate the negative sign of `8 = -9+pets`, multiply both sides by `-1`, yielding `16 = pets`.\n\n9", "answer": " 54"}

So Lloyd and Michael need to add 30 cards each.\n\n- For Lloyd: It's not needed to collect 35 cards more and have to 100, because according to our explanation below Lloyd and Michael need to pass 30 cards each to get 100 cards, so he can add 20 cards and he is through.\n\nSo Michael need to get more than Lloyd to get to 100.

{"text": "Volume = w x h x l\n\n### Demostration(Lead instruction): Use the following information: \n\n### What is the volume of a box if: A) h = 3 and B) w = 7?\n\n### Answer: The short answer is option B for this problem.\n\n### The volume of a box is found based on the width, the height, and the length of the box. \n\nThe problem gives a 12 inch x 12 inch box. The length and height of the box is shown to be 4 times the width of the box. Thus, the height of the box can be expressed as 4\\*7 = 28 and the width, w, can be 3\\*7 = 10. The 4th dimension, length, l is the difference between 28 and 10.\n\nTherefore the volume can be expressed as:\n\n* (12 x 12 x 10) + (28\\*10) +((28 - 10) x 7) = 12 x 4 + 28 x 5 + (18 x 7)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n* V = 280 + 580 + 1260 = 1176\n\nWhen h = 3, the height remains 28 and \n\nwhen w = 7, \n\nthe width, w = 49 and the 4th dimension, l = 6\n\nThus, the volume of the box can be found as:\n\n* V= (12 x 49 x 6) + ((28 x 6 + 6 x 49) + (51 x 7) = (576 + 226 + 364) = 1172\n\nHence, option B gives the best answer given what's already mentioned in the question.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://github.com/Microlab-2021_2022/microlab-workshop/blob/main/assets/images/input_demo.png)\n\n\n\n### Exercise: 2\n\n### Instructions:\nThis exercise", "answer": " 3,888"}
{"text": "She needs to use 66 cups of flour\n\n### Rationale: We know that flour is the required ingredient that Hannah needs to use for every cup of bananas. Therefore, we need to find the total number of cups needed to make a cup of flour according to the given ingredient ratio. Since there is 3 cups of required flour for every cup banana, we need to multiply 3 with the given quantity of bananas - 20 bananas. \n\nFrom this process we can obtain 66 cups required to make one cup of flour, so the final answer is 66 cups.

{"text": "Betty needs an additional $195.\n\n#### Rationale\n\n\nStep 1. Eliminate choices and think. The question is clearly asking for how much money Betty still needs, not about how much money Betty has. We can thus eliminate choices D and E as Betty does not need half of her money.\nWe can also eliminate choice A and B, since Betty's parents and grandparents are both giving her money twice less than her parents, not thrice. This leaves only choices C and D, of which D is the better choice, indicating that Betty's total savings after this addition would be more than enough to buy the wallet.\n\nStep 3.  Explain how to solve. Betty needs $100 to buy the wallet, and her grandparants are giving her $50 twice. How much more needs Betty to buy the wallet after that? From the choice, we know that Betty has two and a half times as much money as her grandparants, so the answer should be $250.\n\nStep 4: Reasoning. A wallet costs $100, and Betty's grandparants are giving Betty $50 twice, so they have $50. The total of Betty and her grandparants' money is $100+50+50=200, so Betty needs another $100 to purchase the wallet.\nTherefore, Betty needs $200 to buy the $100 wallet.\n\n\n\n### Input : A train is leaving the train station.

It's not passive and requires a direct object.\nPay for it and trim it, however, are independent phrases that don't need to be connected.\nPay for it is a passive verb and can be used without an object.\n\n**2 answers**\n**3**\n\n## Hunt the words\n\n\nInputs:He's the boss, it is who he is.\n\n**Hints:**\n* The", "answer": " 11"}

{"text": "Input: What part of speech is \"too\"; adjective or adverb? Choices:  a: adjective b: verbal c: adverb d: noun e: preposition\nRationales:Step 1: The question asks for the part of speech of the word \"too.\" Parts of speech are categories used to classify different types of words in a language based on their function and use.\nStep 2: We know that the part of speech of a word can be determined based on its role in a sentence. For example, an adverb would describe the manner or extent of the action denoted by the main verb in the sentence. So, for our sentence, \"I am too tired,\" where \"too\" modifies the adjective \"tired,\" it would be considered an adverb.\nStep 3: We look at each of the answer choices and determine whether they would be suitable for the role. \n\na: adjectives are used to describe nouns, therefore, not the correct choice.\n\nb: verbs, such as \"run\" or \"jump,\" can be used in the sentence as well, but are not strictly necessary and can be omitted, so we can continue with the other choices.\n\nc: adverbs like \"very\" or \"almost\" can be used to modify the main verb, but that is not what is happening in our sentence. That means it is not suitable.\n\nd: nouns are used to represent people or place names, and can be used in the given sentence to refer to the person being described or the action itself. Even though our sentence includes the word \"of,\" it is not a preposition but a word that denotes the object of the main verb, \"am.\"\n\ne: prepositions are used to connect elements of a sentence together, such as time, space, or relationship. As there is no prepositional phrase in our sentence, the given answer is invalid. \n\nThere is only one remaining answer choice, \"adverb.\" Therefore, the answer is c: adverb.\nAnswer: c: adverb\n\n\n### Example: Fill in the blanks\nInput: The boy went to the river, what was he ____ ____?

Therefore, x can be 9 as we have obtained four \"4\"s in our division. The remaining step is to check if we can proceed to the next step, 4, 8, 12 and 16.

{"text": "Tina made $30 more than Marvin.\n### Rationale: We first recognize that there is a lack of information. We are looking for how much more was made by Tina, but are given no information on how much Marvin made. Therefore, any given answer must be a multiplication of two numbers. \n\nThe first thing to determine is the relationship between Marvin's sales and Tina's sales. Tina sold three times as many candy bars as Marvine, meaning Tina sold 3 x 35 = 105 candy bars. But only Marvin's candy bar sales are known, since we know he sold 35 cacndy bars and we do not know how many Tina sold. If we know Tina's candy bar sale, we can determine Marvin's. So multiply Marvin's cady bar sales by 105 and Tina's by 105 (as there are no other values for x or y). \n\nMv: 35 x 105 = 3725 \n\nTina: 105x105 = 11125 \n\nSubtract 3725 from 11126 to get Tina's remaining candy bar sales of 7321:\n\nTina: (11125 - 3725) = 7325  \n\nNext we determine how much both Marvin and Tina made from the sales. It's $2 dollars each for each bag, so both Marvin and Tinea make 550 dollars in total. \n\nMarvin: 3725 X $2 = 7450 dollars\n\nTina: x = 7321 x $ = 15222 dollars\n\nNext, since we know Tina made three times the sales Marvin did, we know she also made twice as much as Marvin, as she had three times the sales. \n\nMarvine made 25,250 dollars\n\nWhile Tina made 41,773 dollars.\n\nNow subtract Tina's total sales of 73,21 from Marvin's: \n\n15224 - 74", "answer": " 140"}

{"text": "$4.25\n\n### Instructions:Write a response that appropriately answers the question.\n\n## Answer: 4.25\n```\n\n# Part B:\n```\n\nIn the process of getting a college degree, one of the most fundamental aspects to learn is effective communication. Writing is a key skill, and can make a big difference in the quality of one\u2019s writing skills. That is why it is important to know how to effectively use punctuation to help make one a better writer. The key is to be aware of the most common punctuation marks, learn how to use them correctly in a sentence and learn how to use them as properly as possible. So one must first be aware that the most common punctuations marks are; the period, the comma, the exclamation mark, the question mark, the apostrophe, quotations, and a hyphen. The period goes at the end of a sentence. The comma is used to split and differentiate sentences in a series. The exclamation mark can add emphasis to a sentence which a person may need. The question mark goes to ask a question in a given sentence. The apostrophe marks the possession. A quotation mark indicates someone has said something directly. A hyphen tells the reader when to pause for effect. One must make sure to be precise when using periods, commas or question marks. Also, one must use a hyphen between a prefix and a base word. For example, one must use a \u201cnon-commercial\u201d ad instead of a \u201cnoncommercial\u201d ad. Another example is to use an \u201cex-boyfriend\u201d instead the \u201cexboyfriend\u201d to avoid confusion by leaving out a part of a word. One cannot leave out letters either, one must use \u201chundreds\u201d and not \u201chundreads\u201d as well as \u201ctwenty\u201d and not \u201cteeny-teeny\u201d.

The excess meals will be delivered more than twice the number of packages. One less than twice the number of meals or packages will be delivered, which is 17. Therefore, the final result is 29.\n\n### Input (incorrect solution): The answer is F. She'll deliver one less. Answer: D: 27\n\n### Rationales:\n\nResponse is wrong.\n\nOne way to solve is to start by eliminating the options that can\u2019t be correct.\n\nChoice B is not correct as a messenger will only carry one dozen packages. So, we can strike B as incorrect.\n\nChoice D is also incorrect as 16 less meals can not be done. So, we can also strike D as incorrect.\n\nWe are left with choice A, F and C.\n\nFor options A and F, one can only deliver 12 fewer meals, not one dozen fewer.

{"text": "$10,228\n\n### Rationales\n\nStep 1. Read the question carefully.\nWhat the question is asking can be interpreted as follows: \"Daniel has 346 video game collections. He bought 80 games for $12 each, which cost him $1120. How much did he spend on the rest?\"\n\nStep 2. Interpret each option.\nWhen looking at each option, pay attention to their meaning and their placement in the question. \n- $3.78,787 indicates a price of $3.78 for each of 100 games. But the question specifies 346 games, so each game can't cost $3.78.\n- $3,787.80 indicates that each game costs $3.78 and the whole collection was worth $3787.8. If followed, this would contradict the information from Step 1.\n- $792 indicates that each game costs 792. These 792 games would cost a total of $7920, again, contradicting the information from Step 2.\n- $850 indicates that each game cost $850. It is plausible that each game cost $1120, since 80 games cost $112, with the other 346 games costing $850 each. Hence, the correct answer is $8,500.00", "answer": " 2290"}

To answer this question, there are a total of 3 different variables we need to find out:\n* Cost per Movie ticket on each day\n* Days of the week\n* Which day(s) was Glenn going to the theater\n\nWe first get the cost of movie tickets from the question:\n\n* ```$5``` on Monday\n* ```$10``` on Wednesday\n* ```$15``` on Saturday\n\nNext, the days of the week the theater is open is not given in the question but we can make assumptions and observations:\n\n* ```Sunday``` is included in weekdays.\n* ```Monday``` to ```Friday``` are the working days and each day cost ```$5```.\n* ```Saturday``` cost ```$15```\n\nThe first observation is the working days of the week cost ```$5``` and all other days cost ```$15```. We see that each day cost is divided into 2 different ```$5``` and ```$15```, which means the cost per day is ```$15```; this could help us to calculate the final amount that Glenn needs to pay to the theaters.\n\nNext, which day(s) is Glenn going to theater is also not given in the question:\n\n```\n  - On Monday, Glenn spends: ```$15``` \n\n  - On Wednesday, Glenn spends ```$25``` \n  - On Saturday, Glenn spends ``$35```. \n\n```\nThis means, he went to all three days (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday) of the week:\n\n  - On Monday: ```$15 + 15 + 10 = 40$$``` total ticket costs\n  - On Wedneday: ```$25 + 10", "answer": " 35"}

I hope someone I know will be able to help me with this.  What kind of skill does this problem require?\n\n### Demostration: The problem is broken.  That is a physical broken glass so it requires the skill of physical maintenance.  Another explanation is to say it requires mechanical or the knowledge of mechanical.  The broken glass would not open the window if it were a human and therefore it requires mechanical skill.\n\n### Input 2: I'll give you this task for reading comprehension. What's the correct summary?\n\nIn all, from this passage, we can infer that the first option (physical maintenance) is a likely answer. When we consider the rest of the paragraph and the broader meaning of \"fix the problem,\" we can understand that it requires both physical and mechanical maintenance or skills to complete, not just physical. Because we have eliminated \"physical maintenance\" and we have not included \"painting\" or \"redecorating,\" we can eliminate the rest of the options but choose the closest option which is \"mechanical maintenance.\"\n\n### Demosration of second task:\nInput: I'll give this task for reading comprehsion or for reading passage.

To add the lengths of the snakes, we need to find all their lengths and add them together.\n\n2. The first snake is 2ft long, so it's 2ft.\n\n3. The second is 16 inches, so it's also 16 inches.\n\n4. The last snake's length is 10 inches,  so it's also also 10 inches.\n\n5. Putting all three lengths together, we get: 2ft + 16in + 10in.\n\n6. Therefore, we get 1ft14in.\n\n7. We multiply this by 12 inches per foot: 1ft14 *12 = 15ft1.\n\n8. Since there are 3 snakes, multiply 15ft1 by 3: 15ft1 * 3= 45ft3.\n\n9. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, multiply this by 18 inches per foot; the result is 45ft3 * 18in per ft * 12= 378in.\n\n10. Remember, there is a negative conversion factor between cm and inches. We want to change the cm to inches, so we use the negative conversion factor.\n\n11. The result of this step is -378 inches. \n\n12.

In this scenario, Mr. Grey would receive a $12 credit on his credit card because of his total purchase of $292. The $12 would be the difference from his total spend and the total purchase.

It serves no useful purpose.\n\nRationales:\n\n1. The quote indicates that teaching a person to make soap is not a worthy goal if they're not first taught the Gospel. This means the main point of instructing a person to make soap would be to communicate the Gospel to them. This makes sense because if they didn't already believe in the Gospel, there would be no reason to teach them to make soap.\n2. This also suggests that teaching someone to make soap can be beneficial, provided it's done with the purpose of sharing the Gospel. Teaching someone else something skillful can be helpful, and learning a skill you can use is valuable. If someone is taught the Gospel while learning how to make, it would be a good thing.\n3. Furthermore, the quote implies that teaching a heath to make soap is useless if the teacher doesn't bother to share the Gospel with the heath. The teacher would be neglecting the main purpose of instilling those skills. So, it would not be very useful because the Gospel is missing.\n4. Ultimately, the quote indicates that teaching a clergyman to make soap is not the best purpose of teaching that can be useful to the heathen.\n  \n### Instruction Answer:\n\n>It'd be silly to teach a heathen how to make soap since it'd do those more good.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1.

{"text": "The answer to this question is D.\n\n### Rationales:Ratio problems are often set up as simple fractions like 5:7 in the question. When working with ratios, it\u2019s important to note that the denominator is the same in both the numerator and denominator.\n\nIn the question, the numerator is the number of boys in the family, which is equivalent to five in the denominator. Similarly, the denominator of the numerator is equivalent to 7 in its denominator. \n\nThe total number of children is then the sum of both boys and girls. Thus, it needs to be divided equally among the boys and girls, thus yielding a total amount of 180 in the final step. \n\nThe boys are required to share $3900, which needs to be shared among each boy according to their number in ratio 5:7. This means the total amount each boy receives is $580.00. \n\nThe ratio 5:7 can also be expressed as 2:3, which is equivalent to adding 2/3 to the amount the boys receive.\n\nHence, each boy receives $580.58.\n\nAs the denominators of the total number of children and the total amount of boys are the same, the answer to calculate the total amount each boy received has a remainder of 58.058 cents. The remainder of 58 cents is considered insignificant, and therefore, a rounding error is done to obtain the correct result of $580.60.", "answer": " 52"}

{"text": "The answer is 10.24 (2).\n\n### The challenge is to use the given facts to show how many ways Jack's basket can fit into Jill'\n\n### One option is to determine the number of options for Jack's basket to fit in Jill's basket based on different scenarios.  The basket is full when it can hold 12 apples.  Assuming it can hold 4 more, the number of apples it can hold (without being full) is 12 + 4 = 16. If the basket can hold 46 more apples before it's full, this means that the basket can take ten times more apples as it can hold 46 apples. So, the answer is\n\n### 10.23363\n\n### If there is no space or need for Jill's basket to hold Jack's apples, the answer is zero (0) times. For example, if Jack's basket only had 7 apples or could only hold 3 more apples, the answer will not be more than 10 times based on\n\n### 0 times.\n\n### Another way to solve the problem is to convert the problem to an equation.  Let\n\n### \"b\"  stand for the basket, and \n\n### \"a\"  stand for the apples, and\n\n### \"c\" for the capacity the basket can hold, and \n\nThen, the equation is\n\n### \"1 + (ba/c)\" = 16, or \n\n### 2b = 48.\n\n### For example, if Jill's basket has space for 5 more apples, then the basket size is about 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 and Jack's is 11 + 12 = 23.\n\n### So, using the number of times for each option, the answer is\n \n### 1.673138\n\n### \n### The answer to the problem is 10.16+0.98+0 (basket cannot hold Jack's appels); and finally, 10.203634\n### If there was no basket capacity listed,", "answer": " 3"}

The most common type of logical reasoning question is the \"Statement-Assumption\" question, where a statement containing a blank represents a conclusion and several blanks represent the missing parts of an argument that have already been presented. \n2. These are typically two to five questions long and begin with three facts: the missing argument, a conclusion that the argument supports or implies, and a question with a blank corresponding to the conclusion\u2019s missing part. \n3. It\u2019s important to analyze the facts and then identify the conclusion that the argument supports. \n4. Once you have established the conclusion, consider plausible answer choices that meet that criteria with a particular level of certainty, and eliminate answer choices that are less plausible. \n5. After eliminating all other answer choices as less likely, proceed to identify the most plausible answer choice that correctly completes the statement and answer the specific question.\n\n# Tips for Essay Prompt Questions\n\n1) The most important part is understanding the question. \n2) You need to understand what you\u2019re asked to do: either \n  - explain and analyze how an idea is explained by two or more other ideas to demonstrate a point OR\n  - discuss how a concept is defined by two or more other concepts to develop a point of view\n3) After you understand the question, you can focus on the task or topic itself.\n\n# Example\n\n**Explain how each idea and concept in the given example relate to others to develop a point of View**. \n> In 1965, singer and songwriter Johnny Nash released \u201cI Can See Clearly Now,\u201d a song whose popularity increased five fold with the release of a short video in 1985.

How much should they charge me if I ordered a shake and not wine?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: What is the price of the steak after taxes if the NY striploin costs $80 with a 15% surcharge?\nRationales:  \n1. The tax rate (10%) and surcharge (15%) are already known.\n2. 10% is 15%.\n3. So what else must be divided in half and reduced by 15% to reduce total price?\n\n    Wine: $10(100)* (10/)= $10(15/2)= $5\n    Surchage: $12.73 after 10 percentage rate= $12.70 after 15 percentage rate in total $12.7 * 2/3-15%= $8.22\n    If subtract 15% from 81.12 is 70.43 then:\n\n    Total Price:  $80 + $10*15 / 2 + $8.22 * 2/3 -  $15 = $80 + $70.43 - $15 = $75.97\n\n\nOutput: The total price of the dish, including the tax and the surcharge, is $75.98.

{"text": "Bobby's truck consumed 32 miles per gallon.\n\n### Rationale:\nStep 1: The first step is to identify what we know from the information provided in the question.\n- Bobby needs to make some trips\n- He drives 5 miles and then returns home\n- He drives 6 miles and then turns around\n- He drives 2 miles and then returns home again\n- He drives his truck at a rate of 32 miles per gal\nStep 2: Now, we should consider the possible distances and durations covered by each drive based on the above information.\n- First ride: 5 miles total with a return of 5 miles to home. The total duration is 10 miles.\n- Second ride: 6 miles total with return of 2 miles. The total duration is also 6 miles.\n- Third ride: 2 miles total without a return. The total duration is only 4 miles.\n\nStep 3: From analyzing the above information, it's possible that the two return trips represent 1/3 of the total duration on each drive.\n- The first ride took 5 miles to get away, and the return trip took 2 miles to bring him back home, which is 2/3 of the total journey duration.\n- The second ride took 6 miles to complete the trip, meaning the return trip would only take 1/3 of it, i.e. 2 miles.\nStep 4: Inserting the information calculated in Step 3 into the problem gives us the total number of gallons used in the problem.\n- The first rate is calculated as 5 miles/2+gallons used = 16 gallons.\n- The second rate is calculated as 6 miles/2+2 = 18 gallons.\n- In total, it is (16+18)=34 gallons.\n- However, from the question, we know that only 12 gallon were available and then only 2 gallons of it left when 2 miles of journey was completed. Inserting it into the calculation above gives (2/16) gallons used. For the sake of ease, let's round it up to (3/16) gallon used.\n- 32 is the rate at which Bobby's truck consumers gas", "answer": " 2"}

Once we have determined the structure of the sentence, we should interpret the options available. We need to identify the missing component.\n\n3. In order to find the missing component, we should ask what is different in each choice, \"Evil Empire\" versus \"B-Side Ourselves.\"\n\n4. The second choice, \"Evil Emperor\" implies that a piece missing belongs to a side of the album.\n\n5. The first piece of evidence is that \"B-Side Oourselve\" does not contain the word \"Emperor\", indicating that the option is incorrect.\n\n6. The second piece of evidence is that the album does not have any songs titled \"Evil Empire.\" Since this song does not exist, the option must be incorrect.", "answer": " 2"}

Now that you are out of breath from skipping the last 3 blocks, you come to the conclusion that you are going to be late. How many blocks do you have to run to be on time?\n\n### Rewriting:\nThe question is asking the number of blocks required to be on time for the day school. \n\nStep: The first step is to establish what one needs to do to reach school on time. \n\nRunning blocks are the units of measure, so we understand that running blocks and blocks is an indication for time to be on time. \n- After running 3 blocks, you would be out of breath and can't go further at the given speed, leading to late entry and late punishment. \n- The next step is to understand the distance of each block. \n\nIn Chicago, block is a unit of measure that refers to a length of 600 feet or 200 meters; this indicates that each block length has 200 meters. \n\nHaving 600 blocks per mile, it would mean 200 blocks per mile. \n\nStep 3: Using the established 200 blocks equals to 1 mile, we use PEMDAS to apply the necessary mathematics skills. \n\n1.

{"text": "He spends less than half the time he spends on customer outreach on marketing posts\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: How much time in hours does he spend on marketimg posts each day?\n\nAnswer: B: 1/4\n\n### Justification: There are two ways to solve this problem:\n1. Let's assume he spends 4 hours on customer outreaches and 2 hours on marketing posts each day, and he works 8 hours a day. \n\n2. This means 1/4 of his day is spent on marketing posts, and 5/8 is spent on customer outreaches.\n1. Let' say half of customer outreach is spent on marketing, and 1/2 is spent on customer out reach,\n\n2. This results in 1/8 of his day is spent marketing and 7/8 is customer out reach. This matches the second approach.\n3. Now let's plug this into the equation \"Bryan works as x hours a day, which is 1/4 of the time he spends each day on customer outreach, and half of the time he spents on advertisement posts.\"\n\n4. This results in 4 hours spent on marketing and customer outreach combined, which aligns with our assumptions of the initial approach.\n\n5. Therefore, our second approach gives an accurate answer.\n6. Our first approach results in 3/4 of the time spent on advertisment and marketing, so the answer is false.\n\n7.

{"text": "The answer is 1138\n\n### Demostration:\nFirst, notice that the numbers of students in each school is being used to solve for `x` in an equation. In this example, the number of students in the schools is used to solve for `total`, which can be calculated as `total = (3x - x) + x`.\n\nThe following steps outline how to solve for the total:\n1. First, it is known the total must be greater than 1.  \n2. Next, the number of students present in the elementary school is known, so it can be subtracted from the `total`, which leaves 2 less than the total. \n3. The next step is adding 2 to the known amount of elementary students, which results in subtracting 2 less from the total, giving 1.\n4. Finally, the total is solved for, which is 1135.\n\n### Explanation:  \nFirst, a substitution of values is made, where the sum of the elementary and middle school populations can be calculated.\n(3x - x) is evaluated with the given data, leaving 3x = x. Substitute `x = 50` or `3x = 150`.\n\nAfter that, add in the given numbers of students in each level, which adds up to the known sum of `1033`, as calculated in the example.\n\nWhen solved for, total is `1138`, which is the number of students that are in all five levels of school together.\n\nAnswer: 1138  \n\nInput: The young boy awoke early on Monday morning and asked his mom to make eggs.

Break down the task and determine how to answer.\n\n### Rationale\n- Answer is in units of $12 x 57 = $692 = $696\n\n|Step 1|Step 2|Step 3|\n|-------|-------|-------|\n|How much pay?  |57*12=$692|\n|Number of hours?|692/12=57   |\n\n### Task\nInput: A lot of people have been at sick at Gary's, so he's had to work a lot more. As a result, did he work overtime? Choices: 1: No 2: Yes (every time after 40 he make 1.5 times what he makes). 3: Yes (after 40 they earn 4X)\nRationales:1. The first step in responding to this task is to interpret what the question asks.\n2. The question asks whether Gary, a worker, earned overtime during his week.\n3. We look at the options given and consider each in terms of whether it provides a suitable answer to the query.\n4. Option 1: No, the other workers were sick and Gary could not work overtime as he was filling in their shifts. \n5. Option 2: Yes, Gary earns overtime pay after working more than 40 hours a week.\n6. Option 3: Gary's wages are multiplied after 40 hours because it is considered overtime. This is the proper response from the provided answers.\n7. Therefore the correct response is 2: Yes, the worker earned overtime.\nAnswer: 2: Yes, they earn overtime.\n\n### Input\nThe man said, I'll put my finger on my nose and then", "answer": " 52"}

{"text": "The total weight of the three individuals is 123 pounds.\n\n### Rationales: \nStep 1: Reveal which information is given and which is required to solve the problem. \nStep 2 \u2013 Identify given information as Stan weighs 5 pounds more than Steve, Steve weighs 8 pounds less than Jim, and Jim weighs 85 pounds.\nStep 3: Identify given information as a relationship between given values, so that Stan is 85+8=93, Steve is 93-8=85 and Jim is 85+5=90 and thus their sum should be 90+85+93=278 or 279. \nBecause \"the total weight is what they look in total\" and the statement that they \"crowded onto a scale\" means it is a single scale. \nStep 5: In the last step, one considers both the given information and the relationship between given values. In this case, Stan weighs five more pounds than Steve. Since Steve weighs eight pounds less than Jim, Stan weighs eight more pounds than Jim. Now, the statement gives further information that Stan weighs 93, Steve weighs at least 85 (Jim's weight), and Stan weighs 86 (Jim's possible weight), i.e. Jim weighs 90. So, Stan would weigh 90 + 93 = 183 and Steve would weigh 183 \u2212 85 = 98 and, therefore, the total sum is 183 + 98 = 281.\nStep 6: Now, it is important to consider the information that they, in fact, \"crowd onto a single scale\". With just one scale, all three people cannot have a combined total more than the weight of the single scale; only one person can be on the scale at a time. Therefore, the total must be the combined weight of the three people only, leaving out the weight of the scale. \nHence, the total weight of the three people is 85 + 93 + 90 = 268.\nBecause there are only three people, it could not be more or less than 268.", "answer": " 319"}

{"text": "They will earn $30.\n### Rationale: \n1. First, we need to understand the question. There are multiple pieces of information in this question. \n2. The pie shop charges $3 for each slice.\n3. They cut each whole piece of custard pie into 10 pieces, making each piece equal to 1/10 of the original whole pie.\n4. The pie shop produces 6 whole pies, and 60 slices equals 6 pieces.\n5. We can create a list with the relevant data: \n- $3/slice (3 slices per pie, $1) \n- $1/10 of a piece (1 pie = 10 pieces, $10/piece) \n- 6 pieces (6 whole pies, $6)\n6. Now, we can use these values to answer the question. \n- The pie shop charges $1 for each 10th of a piece.\n- There are 60 pieces for 6 pies, or 10 pieces for 6 pieces.\n- Therefore, each 1/10 piece of pie costs $0.10. \n- The money earned by the shop is $60.\n- This could have been found in the original questions as well. As the pie shop produces 6 pies and each whole pie equals 60 slices, we can conclude that with 60 pieces, 1 whole pie will be worth $6.\n7. We can use the list from the previous point to find the answer: \n- The pie is $3 and cut into 10 sized pieces, which earn $1 each \n- There are 10 pieces for less than a pie, or 3 pieces for a whole pie \n- There are $60 total earnings divided by 3 equal pieces.\n8. To summarize, the pie shop receives $30 by cutting and selling each pie (6 whole pies and 60 sized pieces).\nIn summary, you can think about a pie shop the next time you want some, as you'll have your own analytical equation for how it's priced!\nAnswer: $30\n\n- [Next Chapter](./4.4-Nouns)\n- [Previous Chapter](./4.2", "answer": " 180"}

That's quite a set of benefits considering they're the kinds of questions that are generally seen as ineffective. In our first session, we considered four kinds of questions. These were \"What?\" questions, which seek information. \"Why?\" questions, which seek causal relations. \"How?\" questions, which seek procedural relations.

B: If the hostess decides to assign the appetizers evenly, she would choose even divisors between 10 and 7, and divide the total number of appetizers by the number of appetizers in each division.

These are known as anaerobic bacteria and require the presence of oxygen to survive. Oxygen is vital for converting carbon dioxide into energy, a process known as cellular respiration. A bacterium called methanogen is an anaerobic organism capable of producing methane under high oxygen conditions and hydrocarbons under low oxygen conditions. During times of high cellular respiration, an organism's oxygen levels, known as metabolic conditions, may decrease, causing anaerobic cellular respiration in various environments.\n\n### Task Description:\n\nThe answer has been broken into different sections.

{"text": "Answer: 53 \n\n### Instructor notes: \n\nIt's important to recognize that a \"longer\" or \"shorter\" street in terms of length, may not be the same street. For example, a street that is literally longer may have a higher total number of households on it, which could result in a lower number of households per mile of street that Maisie is walking down versus Donna. You have to keep in mind that you're comparing the number of households per mile rather than literal length when considering the choices. \n\nWe can start by eliminating answers that do not fit the specific question as well as possible answer choices that don't follow the answer calculation rule.\n\nQuestion asks for the number of flyers Donna dropped off, not the total between Maisie and Donna.\n\nSince Donna is responsible for dropping off the larger number of flyers for their clean up, Donna dropped the larger number of flyer and not Maisie.\n\nThe answer calculation rule says the answer to \"how *many* did Donna drop off?\" is equal to \"five more than twice as many\" flyers. \n\nSince the answer is a numerical value (number) and not the literal phrase \"five more than twice\" it must use the \"how\" in the question. We can also infer that this would use a number since it has the numerical word \"many\" present. We can replace \"five\" with 5 to get an initial value of 32. \n\nIf we subtract 32 from the number \"twice\" we get 64, which cannot be negative. \n\nThere's no possibility of having more than 63 extra flyers so we must end the answer at 64.\n\nSince 32 + 64 = 96, we subtract 33 from 96 and get 63 because 33 did not change while 63 = 33 + 64.\n63 - 33 = 33 - 33 or 63 - 63 = 0.

{"text": "Avianna had 33 blue candles on her birthay\n\n### Rationales: In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to carefully examine the given information. \n\nWe start by considering all the given information.  We know that Avianna bought candles in a ratio of 5: 3; this means that for every five red candles she bought three blue candles.\n\nFrom the information given, we can also determine that Avianna had 52 candles on her birth date.\n\nAssuming we know the ratio of the numbers of red and blue candles used by Avianna, we can then determine how many blue candles Avianna had on her birthday. \n\nWe can begin by observing that 52 is five times 11 and three times 18, and hence, in the given ratio, the number of blue candles must also be five times 11. \n\nSince we can simplify this by simply saying that we need to divide 52 by 3, we end up with a quotient of 17. \n\nHowever, we do not need to stop there, since we do not have the desired output at this step.  Instead, we can further simplify the quotient, and solve for the number of blue candle equivalents.\n\nThis can either be done using a calculator, or by considering that since there were 52 candles overall, and 33 blue ones, one blue candle would represent 33/52. 30/52, and so on. This gives 5/11. \nHence, to get to the number of blue candlesticks, all we have to do is to divide 17 by 5, and we can now be certain we have 33 blue candlesticks.\n\n### Input 2\n\nFor the second input, the key is understanding and knowing how to solve proportions.\n\nFirst, we recognize  the given ratio.

{"text": "The bus carried 70 people on its first trip and 78 people on its return trip.\n\n### Explanation:\nSolving this problem can be done step by step as follows: \nStep 1:\nThe question states that the capacity of the bus is 200.\nStep 2:\nLet us consider the first trip of the bus as it is carrying 3/4 of the capacity of the bus. From the given information, it means that the bus is carrying only 70 people on the first portion of the trip.\nStep 3:\nNow we can consider the second trip of the bus, which is carrying 4/5 of the capacity of the whole trip. In the previous calculation, there are already 70 people. Hence, the next 100 people equals 78.\nStep 4:\nCombining the final calculations we have 70 + 78 = 148 on the first trip and 148 + 78 = total 126 on the second trip.\nPutting the total people on the first and second trip in the initial condition, we have 70 people were carried on the first trip and the addition 78 people were carried on the second trip. \nThe bus carried 78 people on the second trip and 70 people on first trip, adding up to 148 total people.", "answer": " 310"}

We also know that red is 3 times as many as yellow, and yellow is half as many as blue. From the description, it is reasonable to assume that there are less of yellow candies than of red candies, and it is also reasonable to assume that blue is the most common candies type, in comparison to red and yellow. \n\nNow, let's first list the choices and place each type of candies in a box from the choices. \n* Yellow 10 \n  * Blue 5 \n  * Unknown \n* Red 10 \n* Blue 5\n* Unknown 30\n\nWe can see that there are 10 yellow candies, which Carlos has already eaten. Among the remaining candies, we know that there are 15 blue candies. After Carlos eats the blue candies, there will be only two remaining colors of candies. These two remaining candies must be red and unknown because blue is the most common type and Carlos ate a total of 15. \n\nSince it is unclear which type of candies the unknown are, we can assume that they are both red and blue. This assumes is reasonable as it suggests that there are 5 red and 5 blue candies. \n\nLet's place the red and blue candies in another box, and repeat the process of counting the numbers. Since blue and red are the last box, we can say that we have finished our counting. \n\nWe counted from the left to the right when counting the numbers and then checked one last box. This confirms that our counting was correct and accurate.\n\n### Note: Some answers may not be fully accurate because of the use of unknowns\n\n### Input : Which day does December 31st fall on?\n\n### Demostration: \nThere are two possible answers, correct and incorrect.\n\n### Rationals:\n\n### Answer: [February 29](/questions/0049)\n\n### Input- After he was finished watching the movie, I saw that", "answer": " 90"}

Each cup of bird seed contains 14 birds and needs 1 cup of bird seed. It takes 2 cups total to feed 28 birds.\n\n3. There is a squirrel stealing half the total birdseed, 1 cup.\n\n4. Thus, Ivan's feeder has 28 birds. \n\n5. Ivan has 2 weeks to refill his bird feeder, so there are a total of 14 birds that can go into the feeders.\n\n6. Each week, 7 birds are fed from the first week's 14 birds. After this, 7 new birds come in and each bird gets a weekly half-cup.\n\n7. At the end of the second week, there are also 7 birds left from first week and the 7 new birds.\n\n8. Since the squirrel steals half of the bird seed, there are only 14 birds in the bird feeder.\n\n9. Since Ivan feeds 28 birds in 2 weeks, there are 14 birds for the next week. Ivan needs to feed 14 birds in 7 days.\n\n10. There are 7 days in a week and 14 birds per day, so Ivan can feed 1 bird every hour.\n\n11. Ivan feeds 4 birds an hour at one bird per hour. Ivan needs to feed half that amount to keep up with the 14 birds.\n\n12. At each feeding, Ivan can take out 4 birds. He will feed 8 times.\n\n13. That's a total of 32 birds. After the seventh feeding, the remaining birds will be left, so Ivan needs 1 more bird.\n\n14. Ivan has his bird feeder, which has the room to house 14 birds.

This is a common example of the test's use of context, so we need to know which parts of the sentence are relevant to the task. For example, in the question \"How will this affect the project?\" we know that \"will this affect the project?\" is not relevant because we are only concerned about the project's effect on \"the project.\"\n- Once we have a clear picture of which parts of the sentence we will be working with, we should determine which parts of the sentence will actually be relevant to the task. In this example, the relevant parts are the \"contractors\" and the \"project,\" because everything else is part of what we're considering. Since everything else is part of the question (that is, we want to affect the project, not the contractors' ability to use new technology), the only change we can make that is relevant to the task would be if they were able to use the new technology.\n- Finally, it's necessary to determine how we can use the rest of the sentence to prove or disprove what changed.", "answer": " 21"}

All those working are 24% of the workforce. 55% of office workers are working remotely.  \nHow many of those office workers are working remots are working from home?\n\n### Rationale: \nFirst, consider the scenario: There are total 36% students working remotely out of which 14% is present in office and another 36% is working remotely.\n\nNow consider the scenario: Office workers were 24% of worker's population. Among this 24%, 55% is working remotelly.

{"text": "The number of total chips they have together is 9/10\n\n### Logarithmic reasoning explanation\n\nThis reasoning question requires the use of logarithm in order to find the answer. To explain in detail the solution to this question, imagine this formula:\n\n$${\\begin{aligned} \\frac{50}{2} \\cdot \\frac{100}{2} = 250.000 \\end{aligned}}$$\n\nIf to divide each denominator by 2 (250 divided by 2 is 125), our answer would be 125.000. This means that we divided each denominator by 50 (250 divided again by 50 is.5)\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a similar formula to our previous example to solve the problem:\n\n$${\\text{Susana has } 3/4 = 0.75 \\text{ as many vanilla chocolate chips}. $$\n$$ \\frac{50/4}{0.75} = 750 \\quad$$\n$$ \\frac{10}{\\frac{6}{10}} = 1.200$$\n\n$$ \\begin{aligned} 10 \\cdot \\frac{6}{120} = 5 \\end{aligned}$$\n\n\n$$\\text{Viviana has } \\frac{10}{11}\\text{ as many vanila chocolate chips} \\quad \\cdot \\text{9/49 } = 0.56\\quad$$\n\nTherefore, Susana will be able to eat 120 chips (3/4 of 50), and Viviana will be able to eat, 9/49 or 1 chip less (20 x 9/49 = 0.5).

We already have the choices we're working with, so we can cross off the ones with more light pollution such as kitchen and bathroom. We can also eliminate A: basement; B: bedroom as we already know they are not in the top 2 rooms with the most light pollutants.

The light pollution in this room won't affect how many people are visiting the house, and the number of books in a room won't have an effect on the amount of people visiting. It's also possible that there are more children in this room as a family room is usually used to entertain children and has more entertainment options compared to other rooms in the house. So we can eliminate C: has more children on it as it relates to how a family room is used and not how a room with more light pollution is different to the one with less light pollution. We can also eliminate choices C: has more children visiting it and B: there are more books in it as they don't relate to the difference between the two rooms with light pollution. That leaves us with E: there is more light pollution in the room as the only connection between that choice and the question on light pollution is the room with more light pollutions is different from the room with less light pollution, so E: this has more light pollution would make senses", "answer": " 35"}

The dimensions of the house and the porches. And the question is asking what the total amount of shingles needed are to roof both the house and the porcher.\n\n### Rationales:First step is to consider the square feet of each object.\n\nThe square feet of the house = (10, 4) which can be simplified to 10\u00d74 = 10\u00d710 = 4\u00d74 = 160 \nTherefore, the square feet of the house is 160.

In the statement 'Today, Djibo' sis is as old a's her 'dad was five years ago.'\nThis means today Djibo's younger sister is 5 yrs. older than she was 5 yrs. a'go. Her older sister was born about 5 years a'go, but she was in kindergart, she's 22 now.\nSo when subtraction is done once the difference would be 5 and we need to subtract twice\n\n3. In a'final part when you subtract 35 from '53' to get you get 06. This gives you 5 as a difference, but since you subtracted once you need to subtract once more. So, answer 6 is the difference.\n\n\n# What is the logic behind the first few steps in an algorithmic solution of the question?\n\n### To Solve the Problem:\n- 1. The question reads as \"Djibo is ___ years old. ___ years ago Djibo\nadded his age with his sister\u2019s age and the sum came out to be 35. How \nmuch years old is Djibos Sister today?\"\n- 2. The key here is to understand and interpret the problem properly.\n- 3. Since the sum was 39(17+12), we have to now deduct 39-35 to get the \nreMAINing age in Years. Which is 4 Years.\n\nAnswer: Four Years\n\n# What is Djibo\u2019s present age?", "answer": " 28"}

{"text": "**Step 1: Analyzing the Problem**\n\nThe first step is to break down the problem into simpler steps to understand the task. We can see that there are two main points of information to focus on- 1) the number of people at Ryan\u2019s party as a fraction of the total number of people at the party, 2) the total number of people in the combined parties. Let us call these r and t, respectively.\n\nThe main point of the question is to deduce r from knowing t. To do this, we can write a system of equations:\n\n|r| \u2248 \\( \\bigg | \\frac{4}{t} \\bigg | \\)\n\nSince we are given the total number of attendees across the two parties, we would already know the value of t. All we have to do is solve for r.\n\n|r| = \\( \\bigg | \\big | \\frac{4t}{t} \\big | \\bigg | \\)\n\\(r| = |4| \\)\n\n|r| can be simplified as 6. The answer, then, is 6.\n\n## More questions soon.", "answer": " 192"}

{"text": "32 slices\n\n### Rationale: \n1. First, determine how many slices were eaten. \n2. Dean ate half of the pizza, so he ate: H/2 pizza.\n3. Frank ate 3/Slices of pizza and Sammy only ate 1/3rd of it, so they both ate: Slices.\n4. The total number of slices in pizza is: S + (S/2) + (S/3) = slices\n5. Now, determine how many sliced were left over:\n6. We have slices in total. Now subtract the slices that were eaten:\n7. S - (H/2) - (S/3) - (S/2)  ====>  s - h - S/2 - S/6  ====>  (s - h - S/6) slices remained\n8. Now, solve this equation for S/6: S - h - S/9 ====> S/6 = h/3 ==>S/6 = 0.5 ==> S - (0.5) - S/6 ====>  S - (0.4) ====>  [0.1] which means S = 10.\n9.

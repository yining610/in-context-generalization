The number could also equal 0, meaning \"nothing.\"  The second element of every tuple will be a choice letter, such as A, B, or D.\n\nThe output of every input data should be one string of character letters, beginning with \"A\" and continuing through the letter that corresponds to the solution for that data.  If no solution exists, then the first letter of the string should be \"E\", which stands for \"Error.\"\n\nYou don't have to follow this format strictly--as long as your inputs and outputs are clear and concise enough for the judge to check your answers without spending too much time on it, it'll work. It is, however, required that your inputs always have exactly two elements: a number and a choice letter. Your outputs, however, can have up to five elements, provided that they are the correct letters, and in this order: \"A, B, C, D, or E\".\n\n\n```\nInput (25,A)\nOutput: A\nNotes: 25 = 2 * 5 = 2 choice letters, so there will be 2 answers\nThe \"A\" letter will always be first, regardless of the answer.\nInput (0,B)\nOutput: B\nNotes: 0 = don't make any answers, just choose letter B\nInput (0,C)\nOutput: C\nNotes: 6*3 - 3 = 6 choice letters, so there are 3 answers\nThe \"C\" letter will always be second, regardless of the answer\n```\nThere is another constraint to this: Each choice letter, whether it be capital or lowercase, should be input either as \"capital\" or \"lowercase\".

For medieval, 16th and 17th centuries, the name of the region was applied to the whole north, west and east Prussia. The 19th century saw the emergence of East Prussia (Ostpreussen) as its own, larger region. East Prussia contained East Prussia, Suduri, and parts of Polish Varmia and Masurian lands.  By 1871, East Prussia was fully settled under German government.\n\n2. The name Old Prussia comes from the Germanic name Prusi and was used until the 15th century. It referred to the territories of Old Prussia and the Polish Lands of Prussian Confederation (1413\u20131454) and Kingdom of Poland (1454\u20131772). The name West Prussia comes from Latin Praemonstra (\"forerunners\"). From the 15th to 18th centuries it was used to mark the western parts of Province of Prussia and Prussian territories in the west, east of the Vistula river. In 1871 the region of West Prussia became part of the German Empire.\n\n3. 1871 - Imperial Germany becomes the first major European country to unify and standardize electrical measurement (the first system was called CGS); this is the origin of MKS system of units, which are nowadays generally known as SI units. The German system was first of all named electrical system (Elektrischer Ma\u00dfsystem in German) and later called metre-kilogram-second system (Meter-Kilogramm-System in German). In 1881, the CGS-based system was internationally accepted and replaced the MKS-based system, which then gradually fell out of use and was forgotten. It was rediscovered in the 1960s and 1970s among electrical engineers and was referred to as SI electrical units for a short time before it was named MKS system of units.\n\n4.The first recorded mention of the name \"Poland\" (in this particular spelling)", "answer": " 30"}

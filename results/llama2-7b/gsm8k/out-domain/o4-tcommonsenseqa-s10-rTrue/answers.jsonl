Two of his commutes are by bike, and two of his commutes are on foot. We find this by first dividing Roque\u2019s 2+1 commutes by 2 (which equals one) to find that each commute is half a trip.\nSince Roque walks to work twice and bikes to work twice, the total number of his commutes is four.\nSince there are four days in a week, and each commute takes two hours of Roque\u2019s time, he spends eight hours every week walking and biking to and from work.\nThus, Roque does walk and bike to and from his job for a total of eight hours a week.\n\n### Credits\nMy mentor: https://github.com/HamzaUmar57\nMy Team: https://github.cosuite.app/", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": "1. The given sentence gives us five statements, some of which could be true and some of which could be false.\n2. The sentence begins by highlighting two names (Samantha and Bobbie). \n3. Bobbie's last name has two fewer letters than Jamie's last name of 15. \n4. One way to think about this is that Bobbie's last letters are \"bbie\" while Jamie's last letters are (grey)(15). So Jamie has five more letters in his last name. \n5. The remaining part of the problem suggests that Bobbie has a last name with 14 letters. In fact, it suggests that Bobbie took two letters by replacing them with an 'i'.\n6. This leaves us with the question of how many letters are in Sam's last name. \n7. A good approach is to use the statement as stated above to form a hypothesis. In this case, our hypothesis would be that Sam's last name has three letters with \"sb\" 3 6. \n8. Using this hypothesis, we can determine her last name to be Sally. Her last name has 5 letters, the same length as Jamie's. \n9. In the original problem, we assumed that Bobbie's name has 14 letters. However, the statement reads \"If Bobbie took two letters, her last name,\" which requires Bobbie's last letter to be \"i\"; if the last letter is \"i\", Bobbie's last word will not be \"i,\" therefore, her last letter cannot be replaced with an \"i\" to have 14 letters. \n10. In this case, Bobbie had two letters in her last name, so if Bobbie removed these two letters, she would have a name that was twice the length of Jamies. This is inconsistent with our original logic that Bobbie's full name of \"B.B.i\" would have 14 letters if she removed two letters. \n11.

He collects two liters of seawatert in an old bucket.\n4. The water is 20 percent salt. (The question does not specify the unit for the salt).\n5. When all the water evaporated, how many ml salt will Jack have?\nLet's find out how much salt Jack has in the bucket.\nWe have the equation 2 \u00d7 0.2 = 0.4 mol X. That is, salt of 0.4 kg in the bucket.\nSo he has salt of 0.2 kg in the bucket. This is 0.2L\n(Since we can't get salt, and therefore, we can't get the water and salt mixed).\nTherefore, Jack has salt that is 10 % salt. If we have to combine 10% salt with 80% water, the salt dissolves in water and becomes sodium salt, also known as NaCl.\nSo, Jack has a total of 80% of salt in 10% of salt. It is a combination of about 8 times as much salt as he wants.\nSo, Jack can salt his fish 8 times better and has about 8 times more salt than he wants.\n1.

{"text": "The question is asking how many ounces of a soda Peter bought when he left with a total of $.50 after buying a soda.\n\nSo, with the information given, we can solve for x, where x represents the number of ounces of sodo he bought.\n\nStep 0:\n\nLet x = the number of ounCES of sodA he bought\n\nStep 1:\nThe first part of the question tells us that he spent $.25/ounce, so we can now write this as an equation: $x =.25\n\nStep 2:\nThe next step is to rewrite this as an inequality: x <.25\n\nWe can see that the right answer is 0 because this inequality implies that whatever x is, it it cannot be.25.\n\n(0 is also the only whole number. If you have 4.5 cents, for example, there's no way to turn this into a whole number. So even if he bought an inch of a soda at $.25/ounce he would get $.01.)\n\nIn summary, Peter went to the store to buy soda and brought $2 with him. He ends up with $.50 after buing soda. Since what he had left cannot be less than $.25/ounce then we know that Peter did not buy any ounces, meaning he bought no soda. The answer is 0.", "answer": " 6"}

H (half the height) X (the trapezoid's base)  C. 2 X (the trapezeo's height) D. Trapezoid's Width E.\nOutput:\n1.The area of a trapezeo is found by multiplying the base and the altitude. The base and the altitude of the trapezoid are the legs. One leg has a length of 7, while the other leg has a length of three. The trapezoid has a width of two to one.

{"text": "1) The initial step is to establish what is being asked. We want to know how much money Marvin and Tina made in total from the sale of their candy bars to help their class. 2) The key to the question is the phrase \"class trip\". If we consider only the words \"class trip\", we would conclude that Marvin and Tina both received the same total amount of money since \"funding\" a class trip refers to the total amount needed for \"class\" - not the number of individual class members. 3) Since both Marvin and Tina participated in helping the class trip, both could receive the same amount, while either the total collected, or the money for Tina could be less. For example, Marvin may have sold an additional 20 candy bars, which he split evenly with Tina (20 candy bars = 10 candy bars given to each). 4) After this point, it is clear that Tina is responsible for 3x the amount of the candy bars sold by Marvin. 5) If we were asked to determine who made more from the sale of the 35 candy bar, we could conclude that Marvin made more. If we were asked to find how much Marvin made for the class, we would conclude that he made $11.  6) Finally, if we are asked how much more Tina made than Marvin, we can determine the total amount made from the sale of the candy bars: 50+(15x3)+40+(7.5x5)=$191.50 7) Subtracting Marvin's total from Tina's total gives $68: 68$-11=57, meaning Tina's total is $57, more than Marvin's total of $11.\n8) Thus, Tina made $57 more from the sale of candy bars than Marvin.\n(SOLUTION COPY PERMISSION WITHDRAWN - PRESENT INFORMATION IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY)", "answer": " 140"}

What type of seller could help them find a loan for the loan? Choices: 1: Realty 2: Broker 3: Bank 4: Mortgage Corporation 5: Influencer\nOutput:\n1. A person wants to take a loan to purchase a new house.\n\n2. There's a variety of sellers that could help them, but we'll focus on realty, broker, bank, mortgage corporation, and influencers.\n3. Realty is primarily in the business of selling houses, so they aren't a good choice as a seller. Our focus is on finding a loan, not a house. Also, the loan may come from a bank which is a seller that provides the loan.\n4. A broker is a type of seller, but they don't specialize in providing loans. They're a middleman between the buyer and the seller, and their specialty is in negotiating the terms of the sale. As mentioned above, we're looking for a loan here, not a house.\n5. It sounds like a mortgage corporation could help, as they focus solely on loans and mortgages. They specialize in helping people", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "1)  The question requires you to determine how many days it would take for each student to read the book, given that Emery's speed is 5x that of Serena's, and given that the book takes Serena 20 days to finish reading.\n2)  First, consider Emery and Serena's speeds.  Emery reads 5x as fast as Serena does, so when Serena reads for t days, Emery reads 5t days. This simplifies to 2x t for Emery.\n3)  Let's denote t as the time it takes for Serena to read through the book. We know that if E & S read for t days each, E's total time to read through is 10t. \n4)  Since E reads 2x faster, E takes 20t to finish reading.\n5)  Therefore, we can express this relation as: t = 20/3 = 6.67 d, which represents the amount of time for Emery to finish reading the book.   Since Emery reads 20/3 as fast as Serena takes to finish reading, Emry's time to read = 20/1.5 =13.33 d.\n6)  Similarly, Serena's time to read is t = 10/2 = 5 d. \n7)  Then, to answer the question, we need to add the times for each student to finish reading as follows, 13.33d + 5d = 18.33d, which simplifies to 18.66d (rounded to 19d)  or an average of 19d.", "answer": " 60"}

Since Jill's current amount is double that of Jack's current amount, we can work backwards. Jill's must be twice the weight of Jack's, and we just found that she can hold six times the apples. Therefore, the current weight of Jack's basket is five times larger than the current weight of Jill's basket. This means that Jack's basket can currently hold 60 apples (5x12).\n3. 4.)

The types of taxes paid include Social Security (FICA) and Medicare.\n3) Second, Janet pays 10% of the total amount she pays employees, including their salaries and taxes.\n4) From this, we can derive a few key facts about the problem given to us:\n5) Number of employees: There are six employees who work full-time (25 days a month) in a month, for a total of 150 days.\n6) Number of managers: Janet hires two managers at a salary of 20 dollars per hour, or two managers x 20 dollars = 40 dollars per day x 25 days = $1000 per month, so there are only two managers.\n7) Base pay rates: There are four warehouse employees who each make 15 dollars per hour, meaning this group costs $15 per hour on average.\n8) Hours worked per month: Since the number of employees is 6, and the number of hours per month is 15, we need to multiply $15 x 25 = $375 for each employee.\n9) FICA taxes: For these six employees, FICA taxes amount to 15% of total wages and salaries, or 15% of $3,000, or $450.\n10) Total costs (salary, taxes, employee count): The total costs of one employee for one month is therefore $456 ($375 x 6 + $450).\n11) The total amount of wages and taxes: For this month, Janet must pay 10% (0.1) of the total amount she paid employees. Since only the total amount of employees and corresponding salaries and taxes are known, the total paid to her employees is $8,560 (10% of $86,000).\n12) 10% of $456: For one employee, 10% of this cost is $45.60. Adding all these costs together, we get $45.6 x", "answer": " 22000"}
{"text": "1) We can see right away that Berry is going to have a tough time meeting his goal of reading 50 pages a week. If he continues to read fewer pages than he needs, he'll end the week with a cumulative total below the 50 page mark.\n2) However, since Berry has met his goal on one of the last two days, it's a safe bet to say that he will meet it on Saturday as well.\n3) When we set out to solve the problem, let's identify the variables to see how they relate to the question.\n- Our goal is to be able to total up the number of pages Berry reads in all four weekdays, Saturday and Sunday.\n- We can take the number of pages he reads on Monday, the number of pages he read on Tuesday, the number of pages read on Wednesday, and the number of pages read Friday as variables to use to answer this question.\n- The last two days we will solve for, meaning the number of pages he has to read to meet his goal of 50 pages each weekdays.\n4) Now, how do we do the actual math? Let's write down the number of pages Berries read throughout the week.\n\"Monday: 65 \nTuesday: 28 \nWednesday: 0 \nThursday: 70 \nFriday: 56\"\n 5) So, in order to get the number of pages he needs to read on Saturday to meet his weekly goal, we need to add the numbers of pages he read on Monday,Tuesday,Thursday, and Friday, including the 28 he did not read on Wednesday because he had a soccer game.\n6) Since the total he needs to reach is 243, then we can conclude that he needs to add 56 + 70 + 28 + 56 = 240 pages together to reach the total of 243 he needed to reach his goal.\n 7) If you remember back to Week 1, for every problem we solve, we always need to double check our work for errors. In this case, the equation worked out to be: 56 + 240 = 296. 296 is 16 more", "answer": " 88"}

{"text": "1) Let's analyze the questions. First, it asks us to find out what the tip amount charged was for a bill of $140. We know that a 10% sales tax is applied to the total bill before tax, i.e., the total bill is 110% of the pre-tax bill.\n2) Now, we are required to determine the final bill, which implies that a tip should be added.\n3) Tip is always a percentage (or decimal) of the pre-tax amount. So, we should find out the pre-tax amount and then apply a tip percentage.\n4) In this case, we know the pre-tax amount of $140, and the question asks us to calculate the tip. \n5) So, 140 * 0.01 (10% of the total sales tax in our city is 10%) = $1.4.\n6) Therefore, for the final bill, we have $140.4 (which is the pre-tax) + $1.4 (which is 10% of the sales tax in our city) + 0.15 (which is applied as a tip percentage) = $172.05 (this is the total bill after tax plus 10%/15%).\nSo the final answer was $172.15", "answer": " 41"}

We know that the first day had half of the number of buyers as the second day and that there were 40 more buyes on the second day than the first day. We are also told that there were no buyers the day before the first day. We can plug these facts into an equation and simplify the situation:\nlet k be the day number (starting at 0),\nlet n be the number of buyers, and\nlet d be the number of days.\nWe end up with the equation:\n  1/2[((k + 1) + 40 - [((k + 1)*1) + 1] = 50\n\n2. Let the equation be equal to:\nA = (1/2)[((k + 1)+ 40-[(k+1)*1]+1) = 50\nNow, we need to solve for k since the equation has A = 50\n      A = 50 -> A is 50\n      k + 1 = 50 -> k is 49\n      (k + 1) = 51 -> \n      ((k + 1)*2) + -2 = 51 \n      (k + x) + 49 = 51  -> x = 7 \n\n3.

This could give us an answer of: David could wash 4 windows in 10 minutes, so David should take 40 minutes to wash all 4 windows. That's how long he would take to finish an entire window of his house - but he has 64 windows, so he should actually take 240 minutes (40 x 64) to finish this job, or about 2 hours.\n3) However, another option could be: If David washes 8 windows per minute, he would take 30 minutes to wash the first one, the second would take another 30 minutes, and so on.

The first step then is to figure out how much does it cost to produce.\n3) We can subtract the 3rd set of numbers: $120 / 60 = $2 because of the equation's order of operations. \n4) The formula for the profits equals 2$/30% = 0.066$ or 66 cents = 0.00066 which then makes the final answer of $9.34 million.\nSo the final correct answer is $9.34M\n\nInput: What are the two digits of the sum of 23 and 86 and the product of 8 and 30? \nOutput: 1 )The first step is writing out the sum and multipliying the products and then we get \n229 + 44 *  .4 = 183 +   18 = 201 \n2 )We are given two products and two sums, so we know that each product is the product of one of the sums. \n3 ) We can eliminate options A and B because they are two different sums and products that don't directly relate to each other.\n4 )Now we can eliminate C because the sum is 23 and the product is 8. This means that 23 isn't involved in the product, which means it wouldn't be an answer option.\n5 ) Option D is eliminated because 86 *.3 doesn't equal 119 or 215. Option D is inaccurate.\n6 )Now, 201 and 83 are involved in the product and the sum\n7 )We know that the second product is 201, so the solution is 8 * 201=8*23=186, and the solution is 8 + 18 = 26\nSo the final answer in the correct solution is 2", "answer": " 192000000"}
{"text": "1a. The first step would be to use the information provided to determine the length of time that each movie takes.\n\n1. The first movie is one hour and thirty minutes long.\n\n2. In addition, the second movie is thirty minutes longer than the first movie, which means it would take three times as long as the first movie to watch.\n\n2b. However, we need to determine how long it would take to cook the popcorn and fries before they watch the movies.\n\n2c. According to the question, it takes 10 minutes to make popcorn and twice the time to make fries, which means it takes 20 minutes to complete the task.\n\n2d. Therefore, the time spend before the movies would be 120 minutes.\n2e. In essence, the total time needed to watch the movies would be (120 minutes + 120 minutes) / 2 = one hour and forty minutes.\n\n3a. The number of movies watched is two movies.\n\n3b. The number of hours it took to watch the movies is sixty minutes.\n\n3c. The resultant time would be (number of hours * number of movies) / 100 = (60 * 2) / 10 = thirty minutes.\n\n4a.

{"text": "The question asks us to compare the amount of rain experienced between Greg's home and when he was camping. The question provides three possible daily rainfall totals in mm for when Greg was camping (3, 6, and 5). We also have the daily rainfall totality Greg's home (26). It is apparent that the camping rainfall totals together are less than the hom rain total. We do not, however, have enough information to determine by how much.\n1. To determine the percentage difference in rainfall between Greg's home during the week and the combined rainfall totals that he experienced while camping, we need to know what the home rainfall total is.\n2. We can calculate the percentage difference by using the following formula:\npercentage Difference = (Rainfall at home - total rainfall when camping) / rainfall total at home\n\n3. To convert the 26 mm rainfall into a percentage, we will use the fact that 100/26 =.3846\n4. To simplify the calculation and to get rid of the decimals, we will multiply the percentage by 100.\n5. Using the formula from above (in Step 1), we can write it as:\n\n(26 - (3 + 6 + 5)) / 26 = (26 - 17) / 26 = 9 / 26 =.3462 x 100 = 34.62%\nSo the final answer according to the question is option A: 34.6%.\n\nInput:Why would you want to remove a badge you received?

{"text": "1) The first step is to identify the given values, which are as follows: \n- Crane 1 height: 228 feet\n- Crane 2 height: 120 feet\n- Higher Building: 100 feet\n- Lower building: 200 feet\n- Taller Building: 140 feet 2) The next step is to express the given values in terms of ratios. The ratio of Crane 1's height to Higher Building's height is 228/200, and the ratio of Crane 2's height to Lower Building's height is also 120/100. Thus, the ratio between Crane 1' average height and Higher Building's average height is 22/20. 3) Subtracting one ratio from the other gives us the ratio Crane 2 height/Taller Building height. This ratio is 12/14. 4) Finally, we can solve for the percent by using the formula: ((100 - answer) / 100) * 100 % = answer * 100 %. Thus, ((14 -147))/140) * 110 % = (12/14) * 11% = (50% - 50%) * 110% = 5% * 110%. 5) The percent should simplify into (5/10) * 1%, which gives us the answer of 0.5 * 1%, or 50% + 5% (rounded to one decimal place).

Their current system's crime was 15%. By how much will the new system reduce the rate of crime?\nOutput: \n1.The crime rate here represents the number of crimes per day.\n2.The company wants to beef it up by 15% so we can say that it wants to decrease crime by 15%.\n3.It's current rate is 15% since that's how the current system works (so the crime rate = 15%)\n4.The new system will reduce the rate of crime by the same percentage. This works because if something reduces crime by 15%, and the current rate is 100%, then after applying the percentage to crime it will reduce crime by 15%\n5.So on a day where we observe 100 crimes, on day after the new system is installed we will have 100 - 15 = 85. As you can see decreasing crime by 15 is equivalent to saying crime will decrease by 15 %. The same percentage you subtract to compute something's pre and post condition must be subtracted to compute two consecutive post conditions.\n6.Therefore, the final answer is 100 - (15/100) = 95.\n\nInput: In a game of Hangman, how many words did Jim think of until he got it right?

The word \"after\" can be connected to the words \"once\", \"seldom\", and \"often\", so these were all options we can choose.\n3.)

The second word we can eliminate is \u201conce\u201d. We are given the choice between \u201cafter\u201d and \u201conce\u201d, so obviously \"after\" does not equal \"once\".

We can do this by using mathematical logic.\n3. 'Six' is a possible answer, however, if we divide 5 by 3 (the owl's hoots per minute), then it becomes clear that 6 hooting owls would make an average of 5 hoots per minute. Therefore, six is not an answer. Same can be said for 8, which is why we can eliminate those two options. \n4. Let's look at remaining possible answers. Let's analyze the other options one at a time. A 'one' is only option we haven't eliminated, but it's logical to presume that one owl's hooting for one minute would only make one hoot, so that is not a good answer. 'None' is also eliminated since none could be the answer if an owl is making 0 hoots per minute. Similarly 'three' would not make sense either because 5/3 is equal to 1.66. So, the only answer left is 'two'. Two owls would make 10 hoots per minute (5 hoots each), resulting in 25 hoots each minute (5/2=12.5/30 = 0.45=5 hoots a minute ).\n5.

{"text": "1) Pat is having a picnic at which 7 members of her family are to take part. Everyone is to receive the same share of the food she has. She has 45 cookies, 63 pieces of candies and 20 brownies.\n2) It is to be assumed from the text that every person in the picnic party eats the same amount of food, regardless of the quantity of the particular food. The number of people to share every food must be divisible by the quantity of the food.\n3) 60 (or 63, if the number of pieces of candies needs to be rounded to the next integer) and 20 are prime (and relatively prime) numbers. This implies that they should be divided into their multiples to make them multiples of 63 (or 20) with remainder 0 or 1 (which is the same as the previous result, as in every division the next higher digit always exceeds the digit on which the division is going to be performed).\n4) Each individual is to receive four times as much of each of the three food types (i.e., 4*41, + 4*43, 4*45).\n5) The given text makes it obvious that in most cases a piece of candy or a brownie must be shared between 2 members. As we deal with cases where there are no remainder in division of the food by the number of people to share the food, they all can be assumed to be equally divisible (regardless of the fact that some of the shared foods are divisible by 5, while others are not, due to their different qualities). We should, therefore, divide food by 6 (not by 7) and multiply results by number of pieces in each of the three groups of foods.\n6) As we deal only with even numbers (rounded if needed) we cannot use the divisibility by 4 (or 6).\n7) The final form of the results is (4141, + 63, + (20*(Number of People))). \nSo the final answer and the result would be: 4545 + 63 + (20*(7)) = 14545\n\nInput:What would be necessary to stop a fountain in winter?

There are 2 components(volume control and power) that need to be solved.\n2. Now, the question is how loud? This means volume. Volume is in units of decibel (dB). 1 Decibel is the increase or decrease in power by 10^1. So If the volume is 10 and we want to increase by 20 decibels (20 * 10^1). we need to multiply 10 by 20. In other words, the answer we are looking for is 40dB or 20 * 1 dB.\n3. Now, the next hurdle is what is the volume control. This means we need to solve for it.\n4. Now, we have a problem solving. We have 60 watt power and 40% volume control.\n5. Now, we need to look for the formula. What is the relationship between volume and power.\n6. Power = Volume * Amplification\n7. So, what do we know?

This means that he should have half of 108 or 54 tomatoes. However, we've been given that Haruto has half of what he started with, so this is already accounted for.\n3.) The problem can be solved by using 2.) and also knowing that the original tomatoes were reduced by 19 (i.e., the birds ate 19 tomatoes). This means that Haruto started with 100 tomatoes (120 - 19 = 100) which we know he has 54 left now (108 - 54 = 54).\n4.)

Therefore, Harvey ran a total number of miles that is equal to 8 times the number of miles his friend Sam ran.\n4. If we substitute the numbers 12 and 8 into the calculation, the equation will look like this: 8 x 12 = 96.\n5. Adding 96 to 12, the equation simplifies to 108 miles.

{"text": "Solution :\n1. The question asks how many miles Tony will have driven when he is approximately halfway through driving around to complete his errands. Thus, the distance traveled is not known, and it must be calculated. \n2. To calculate the distance traveled in miles, we can perform the following steps:\n 1. Let T be the distance traveled by Tony\n  2. Total amount of traveling is equivalent to a straight line. \n2. Firstly Tony travels 10 miles to go shopping. So we can consider this distance as 10 units and write it as T = 10 \n 3. Secondly we want to calculate the time taken by Tony to reach the hairdresser. We know it is 15 miles for him.\n  4. Therefore time taken is 15 miles / 10 units so we have t = 15/10\n3. Thirdly total driving time = t + t = (15/10) + (15/1) = 15 + 15 = 30 \n  5. To calculate the total distance we have total driving time so total distance should be equal to the driving time so, it is written as T = t as we know that he has completed his task of grocery and haircut. \n  6. Total driving time is 30 and time is taken is 10 so we can consider Tony as a driver he drives 10 miles in each minute so, his 30min drive is equal to 10\u00d730 = 300\n4. Lastly, since we know that Tony reaches the doctor's office in 80 minutes, we can assume that he has driven for another 50 minutes. The total drive is then 300 + (50/60) = 400, so total distance traveled is T= 400.\n5. So the final answer is T= 430 \n\nSo the final answer for this question is 430", "answer": " 15"}

If we subtract the three men's heights, we get back to 61 (Gracie was 2 less than Grayson, and Grayson was 2 less than Griffin, so we get back to 59, and adding 1 in for Gracie, we're back at 61).\n6. If we subtract the men's heights from each other, we get 9 (Grayson subtracts 24 from Gracie, then 24 subtracts 24)\n7. Grayson subtracts 27 and 24 from Gracy, and 27 subtracts 24. We also get that with two subtractions we will get the same distance, \"2 inches\". In this case, Grayson is 9 inches shorter than Gracie.\n8. Grayson subtracts from Griffin 27 inches.\n9. If we get the difference from 61 and 27, we get 34. We subtract again from 34 (Grayson is 9 inches less than Gracie). Now, Grayson subtracts 15 from Griffin.\n10. If we get the \"2 inches\" from the next subtracting and adding, we find that Greg is 53 inches taller than Grayson.\n11. If we find the difference from the two we have, we get 14. Therefore, we subtracted it from Gracie.\n12. Grayson subtracts again, and we get 47. However, we do not subtract from Gracie anymore, but from Grayson. Grayson subtracts it to Gracie, thus the result is Grayson is 14 inches less than Gracy.\n13. Grayson is 10 inches less than Gracye. It results that a) Gracye is about 64 inches tall.\n14.

If the dog can run 50 feet per second, how long will it take for the dog to catch up with the ball?\n\n\n- Solution:\n\nThe dog starts running at the same instant that Belinda stops throwing the ball, so they both start running exactly 3 seconds after the ball is thrown.\nBoth run at a constant rate thereafter so the dog will always be running faster than Belinda once it catches up.\nThus, the dog will never reach the ball nor will it exceed the speed of the ball.\nSo the dog must always be running faster than the ball.\nBecause the dog starts running 3 seconds after the throw, at which the ball will have moved 60 ft./second, it will take the dog 18 sec. to catch up.\n\nA man can mow his lawn in 2 hours if he mows it at the rate of 4 inches per minute.

Now, to calculate the number of not defective engines, we need subtract the number of not defecte engines from the total number of engines as follows:\n5*80-400=300\nSo, the number of not defect engines is 300.\nOption 3. Answer: 200The first step is same as option 1.\nNext, we need to find the number of defect engines by multiplying the defective engine size by the number of batches. The defective engine size is 7 plus 1. For example, if the engine is larger than 8 will be considered defective and vice-versa.\n07*05+01*04=30\nSo, the answer will be (500-300)=200\nOption 4.

Option A) 2 is incorrect, as it would only be needed if the pool was 21 units short. Option B) 7 is incorrect, as the total number needed would NOT match the blue tile + red tile combination.

{"text": "The question asks how many apples Chang received based on his selling price and the proportions of sweet and sour apples. \n1. First, it is important to review the question and understand the basic information required. In our example, we know that Chang has 75% sweet apples and 25% sour apples. We also know that he can sell the sweet apples for $.5 and the sour apples for $.1. \n2. Once we have the basic information, we can begin to formulate an approach to solve for the number of apples. The first step is determining how much money Chang made. Since the apples were sold for $.5 and $.1, the total amount he made was $40. \n3. To find the number of apples Chang received, we need to solve for x, the number of apples he had. Since we know his total amount of apples is 75% sweet and 25%sour, we can use that information to solve for x. We know the first equation to be true, 125% = $.5. We can also divide both sides by $.5 to get x = 125/5. The second equation to be true is 25% = $.1. We can also divide each side by $.1 to get 25 =.1x. The third equation to be true is total = $.5. Substituting the first equation for x into total, we can solve total = (125/5) * $.5 = $.75. \n4. Finally, multiplying both sides by x, we can solve x = (125/.5) * x = 12.5. Thus, Chang's number of apples was 12.5, and he made a total of $40.\nSo the final answe is A: 12.5", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "1) The given information in the problem defines the set of jobs. \n\n2) All three jobs have the possibility of making the most money. \n\n3) As a plumber would typically charge more to work on toilets or fix more expensive fixtures, we can eliminate the choices for which job will make more money. \n\n4) The first two choices each involve fixing two toilets and three fixtures.  So,  we will consider the final job choice which involves fixing one toilety two showers and three fixtures to be the least expensive job and the other two to be the most expensive to do. \n\n5) Since this is the third job, all the fixtures are equal in cost, regardless of which job is chosen.  By this reasoning, we can eliminate the second choice, since it doesn't offer any cost savings.  This leaves us with three fixtures, fixed by a single toilet, as the most economical of our choice set. \n\n6) The most money made from any of the above choices will be from the three fixtures and one toilet.  From here, we will calculate the amount of money earned in each scenario. \n\nIn total, there are 10 fixtures (3 sinks, 2 showers and 5 toilets).  The total amount earned from 3 sinks, 3 showers and 5 fixtures will be $420, where the cost of a sink is $30, a shower is $40 and toilet is $50. \nIn total, there is 1 toilet, 2 showers, and 3 fixtures.  The total amount earned is $150, since the cost of 3 showers and fixtures is $120.\n\nTherefore, the plumber can best get $420 by fixing 1 toilet. \n\nTherefore, we can answer that a plumber can make the most money fixing 1 toilets. \n\nSo, the solution can be summarized as:\nThe plumber can best get 420 dollars by fixing just one toilet.\n\n---\n\nFor more details:http://www.mymathglove.com/courses/9th_grade_", "answer": " 250"}

{"text": "1. There are two cups in Ivan's bird feeder, and each cup can hold 14 birds. The birds eating from the bird feeder add up to 28 birds weekly. That is because each cup holds 14 birds and 14 weeks in the current year. After that, there is 1 cup left in the two cups of the bird feeder, and it's left over. If you compare it with the previous year, there is only 14 weeks in 15, so there are no birds in the cup left and the squirrel added half the cup. The squirrel took 14 birds (1/2) of the two cups and added 14 birds.\n2. The bird feeder feeds 28 birds every week, because each cup can hold 28 birds and 14 birds in the current year. The squirrel can keep taking 14 birds, but that doesn't matter anymore.\n3. If you want to add a squirrel, you can count it because it steals half the cup and the squirrel takes it over and over again each week. That\u2019s not a coincidence, squirrels are notorious for snatching birdseed, but the squirrel steals from the birds. Since the birds can\u2019t eat the whole cup every week, the squirrel can eat the birdseed. That's because the birds are getting half of it and the birdseeds are half gone.\n4. But what if there are no birds in a week? If there are no birds, the squirrel won't take any birdseed, but he will take the rest of the birds, he'll steal half of it. If no bird was in a week, the birdseed will remain in the cup.\n5. The squirrel steals half of a cup 14 birds in 15 weeks and the bird feeder is full every other week.\n6.

{"text": "1 A.) The question tells us that the original price of the porcelain vases was 200 dollars and that there was a 25% off sale.\n2 B.) Using the price/sales tax formula, we can solve this problem in multiple ways. Some methods are more difficult to remember or execute than others so let's look at them.\n3 C.) One of the simplest methods is to create a new equation that subtracts the original price of $200 dollars from $175 dollars, which leaves us with $25 dollars. Since the sale price was 25% off, we can multiply the 25 dollars by.75%. This leaves us with $18.75.\nThis isn't the only method though. You may instead multiply the $175 dollars by.7 to get $129.75, subtract that from the original $200, and finally subtract the $12.97 sales tax.\n4 D.)

The question is: how old was her brother if she is three years older? It means, 3 (age of her brother) = 15 (age of Alice) + 2 (age of her brother). So, the age of Alice = 15 - 3 = 12. Thus, the age of her brother = 3 (age of Alice) - 2 (age of herself) = 10. So, she is 10 years older than her brother; that makes 10 + 3 = 13 years older. Then, 1 + (1/3) of (age", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "So, the question asks you to evaluate Jack's leftover funds after purchasing food and drink from a grocery store.\n1. The first step in solving the problem is to determine what information we have about the original amount Jack had, and the different items he purchased.\n2. First, we know his original budget was $100. We can account for this $100 as a separate bucket.\n3. Second, we know exactly how much each food item costs: 4 bottles of $2 and 1.5 pounds of $10 cheese.\n4. Third, we can account for the quantity of each item he purchased:\n- He bought 4 bottles at the start\n- He bought 2 extra bottles, so he has 6 bottles total now. Therefore, he has +/- 6 bottles.\n- He also bought +/- 0.5 pounds of cheese, since we don't have the exact number.\n5. Fourth, we don't know how much Jack had remaining after purchasing the first items. That is our goal for this question. It is a given he had $100 to start.\n6. So now, we have everything we need to solve this problem! The only thing we can do is look at each bucket, and determine which one it goes into.\n7. The water bottles are a relatively low-cost item, so we can assume no problem with them!\n8. The initial $100 went into the cheese bucket. This is because we don't know the exact quantity, so we don't need to take into account the cost for that item. If the quantity were known, we wouldn't have needed this initial $100, and it would go directly into the cheese bucket without considering the initial budget.\n9. With the cheese bucket accounted for, we must consider the items Jack bought at the end. They were:\nb) half a pound of $2 cheese\nc) 1 pound of $10 chees\n10. To figure out Jack's total budget, we just have to add up our buckets.\n11. We can therefore conclude, based on this calculation, that Jack's initial leftover budget is $2.\nSo the final solution is: Jack has $2 remaining\n\nInput: What", "answer": " 71"}

{"text": "1. Tony wants to build the longest possible rope given some pre-existing rope. \n2. The first step is determine what exactly 'knit' means in the question. The word refers to tightly wrapping a knot, which would shorten the overall rope. This doesn't just mean every single join in the knot, but all the joins together. A common example of this in knitting (in which knit refers to the act of pulling together the loops to make a stitch) is the 'looseness' in a stitch due to the 'loops' that are created by the knit. \n3. This means that every knit will shorten the rope by at least 1.2' (since it accounts for both the rope he's already made and the knot itself). \n4. For example, let's look at the rope that Tony already has:\n\n8' x 1.4' = 13.2'\n\n20' x 1.2' = 24'\n\n2' x 1.5' = 5.2' \n\n7' x 1.6' = 13'\n\nAs you can see, after each tie a knit occurs between the ropes. So let's evaluate the rope as a whole:\n\n8' - (1.2 + 1.5 + 1.4 + 1.6) = 0' \n\n20' - (1.5 + 2.25 + 1.6 + 1.5) = -3' \n\n2' - (1.6 + 2.2 + 2.4 + 2.5) = 0'\n\n7' - (1.8 + 1.75 + 1.85 + 2.6) - 0'\n\nAs you have seen, once the rope's \"total length\" is subtracted from the combined length of the knots, there should be zero left, as the shortest rope Tony can make is 0.\n5. Tony does not need all the rope he finds to make the longest rope. To complete this problem, we can remove any useless ropes from the set and still build the longest rope.\n\nLet's", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "The question is asking John how much coffee he consumes every day given that he buys 1/4 gallon jugs of coffee that he consumes over the course of 4 days. You must therefore find the average number of containers John needs to drink over a 4-day span: (1/2 gallon) / 4 days = (1/4 gallon) / 1 day. You will thus need to calculate how many containers fit into a gallon to be able to answer this question.\n1. A gallon of milk has 16 cups. That means 8 containers of milk fit into a gallon of milk. \n2. 8 cups fit into every other container. \n3. John consumes 16 cups of coffee daily, which equals 16x8 = 128 cups of coffee per week. Thus, 128x7 = 928 cups over the course of a month.  Each container equals 128 cupps, which means that it takes 128 containers of coffee to fill up a month.\n4. If John drinks 8x128 = 1,024 cups per month, that means that he drinks 1.024 gallons of coffee daily over the course of the month.\n5. 1.02(gallons) will equal 114 gallons of coffee over the course of a year. Therefore, John drinks on average 114 gallon jugs over the course of a 365 day period. \n6. To simplify further, we can make a 10 times 114, which will give us 1,140 gallons in a year.

Firstly, you need to understand that if she is working in the old company for three years, she will have worked in it for the period of one year two months one day.\n3. Now, she has been employed in the new company for 5 months after leaving her old company. Therefore, the total number of months she's worked at both companies = 1 year, 2 months, 1 day + 5 months.\n4. This gives = 1 year,1 month, 8 days.\n5. Now, to earn in both companies, we need the total number of months times the salary she earns in that month.\n6. The formula is, ${earnings} = \\frac{{month x salary}}{{12}}\n7.

First, the combustion ratio. This is determined by the amount of the fuel in the ignition chamber compared to the amount of gasses. Second, the air/fuel ratio. This is the ratio of fuel to air, and it controls the amount of gass in the chamber. The compression ratio is the final component, and it's the ratio of gasses to air within the chamber.\nThe rationale is simple: the final ratio of air vs. gases determines the number of compression cycles in that chamber in a minute.  Compression ratio is the proportion of air pressure over gaseous pressure - usually, the ratio is 1:1. This means that the pressure of air and gases in the chamber are both equal. The higher the compression ratio, the more compression cycles per minute the engine can perform. Compression ratio is typically measured in compression.\nThere are a few different ways to determine the compression ratio. One method is to measure the volume of the chamber and the volume of compressed air and gas. Another way is to measure the pressure of the air and gas against the temperature and volume of the chamber.\nIn a car engine, the volume of the engine is measured in cubic inches, the volume of the chamber is measured in cubic feet, the volume of air and gas is measured", "answer": " 2"}

I\u2019d also like to give my grandma a book, but she lives too far away for me to go deliver it, and so I don\u2019t want to spend a lot on postage. If it costs $5.00 for a 2-ounce package to ship to her, do I want to spend more than 20 percent of the price of the book on postage?\nOutput: 1) The first step would be to identify the given values and calculate the total $ value of \"The History of American Women\" + postage = $25 ($19.99 for a total of $25) 2) Next, you need to decide whether the percentage is to be applied to the total cost of $25, the original price of the book, or the purchase price of the book (which the person has to pay out of their budget). In this case, it seems that the choice is applied to the total price, but let's continue with the assumption that it's applied to the purchase price. 3) The question now is \"If it costs $5.40 for a 2 ounce package to ship to my grandmother, do I want to pay more than $25 on shipping?\". From here, to determine the percentage of total price, you need to calculate the cost first. $5.40 = $25 x 12/100 Since we're trying to spend less than 20% out of the total of $25, we need to subtract 20% from 12/1, or 20%.

{"text": "This is a good example of how to use the Cake-Walk strategy to simplify math problems before solving them. \n1. First, let's evaluate the variables involved: \n2. Time Period = Hours\n3. Mitchell would have read 10 chapters of a 10 chapter book during each hour.\n4. After each hour ended, she would start reading from Chapter 12. \n5. However, after the first hour, she may have either: \n6. (a) read 20 pages which would leave her with (20/100)% done to complete, and \n7. (b) read 10 pages which would leave you with (10/100))%, and \n8. In either case, she would have read either (20 pages total or 10 pages total), which leads us to our next step. \n9. Now, we can rephrase the problem to make it easier to solve: How many pages did Mitchell read during each hour? \n10. Since she must have read 20 pages during the first hour (for a total of 2 hours), we can write a formula that translates to: 20 X Hours, which is equivalent to \n11. 20 X HOURS = 20 X 2 = 40\n12. This means that she could have probably read the entire book in 2 hours time (which is how we interpret the problem in the next step).\n13. The next step is to write out the formula but make it easier to solve. We can use the \"time is double in an hour\" formula to simplify time, which is as follows: HOURS = 1/2X TIME, which means that Mitchell may have read 16 pages (8 of them in each hour) per hour.\n14. So, the next step is to evaluate each hour she read, which is as follows for hours 1 and 2: \n15. HOURS X (20 X 1)= 40X 2= 80 (pages) \n16.

{"text": "1) Janet filmed a new film that is 60 percent longer than her previous 1-hour long film.\n2) Her film costs $50 for every minute.\n3) Her previous film costs her $100 per minute.\n4) Let us use the formula $100 = $50 X 2. Thus, $50 represents $100/$2= $50. So $50 x 2 = $100.\n5) We know that the movie cost Janet $50 per minute for her previous film. And the movie the next time costed her double of that amount, which is $100. Using the formula $10 = $5 X 2, $10 represents $5 X 2. Likewise, since the previous costed her $50, 60% is equal to 60% $50 = $50.60. So $5 X 2 times 70% of $50 equals to $50.\n6) After all of the above, $50.6 X 60% = 91.3$ (that is $50.6$ times 0.6 is $91.3$ in total). $91.3 x 2 = $ 182.6$ (because $50.6 x 1.2 = 61.3$, and $50.6 * 1.2 * (8/10) = 61.5$, and $50$ x (60% - 61%)=$30$.

First, that the buggy's acceleration can be considered instantaneous: when the buggy reaches the downhill side of the hill, it immediately accelerates down at the downhill rate.\nThe second assumption is that the buggy' ride speed on each terrain is linear. In other words, there is no stopping, going uphill and then downhill, or turning. For example, suppose the buggy rides up a hill and then down again all on different parts of the same hill. It still travels at 18 mph on the uphill and 12 mph, which could be considered 36 mph on the \"downhill\" part. This assumption is the basis for the solution.\n3: There are three stages in which we must determine the buggy's average speed in each of them.

If the dress is selected at random, what is the probability that it will be a pink dress?\nOutput:1. The question is stated in a way that makes the probability of buying more than one kind of dress non-zero.\n2. Pink and green are both types of dresses, which are not distinct options.\n3. If the dress is to have at least 50% probability of being pink, then the probability of it being pink should be at least 25% (since it has a 50% chance of being pink).\n4. If the probability of the dress being pink is no greater than 25%, then the probability of the dress be green is at least 25%.\nSo the final answer to the question is 25%.", "answer": " 1210"}

Leave the dog inside, then clean it\nOutput: Answer is B, Leave the dog inside and clean it\n1.  If your dog licks you, and you decide to Run with it, you\u2019re just increasing the chances the dog might lick you again, because you\u2019re moving further away from the dog and into the territory of other scary things.\n2. In general, if a scary thing is chasing you, your best bet is to hide.\nBut, if your dog is doing this, you have an opportunity! (This doesn\u2019t make you less scared, but it lowers the risk that the dog is trying to take advantage of that fear through an insidious strategy like \u201cfaking it\u201d until you\u2019re right next to it, and then biting you.)\n3.

The answer is that it's likely you're on the edge of bankruptcy if you've gotten to that point, so why bother? It's fair to say you should try and pay it back. If that fails, you should accept that you're now in debt up", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "# Explanation:\n\nSo, the question is asking how many coats can he (Andy) make given that he has 30 minks, each mink has 4 babies, and half of the total minks are released by activists. \n\n-First, we need to determine the total number of babies. 30 minks * 6 babies per mink = 180 babies.\n-Since half of the total of minks are released by animal activists, half of the total of babies (i.e., 90 babies) end up being released.\n-So, we know now that we have 60 babies that are used to create coats. We know that it takes 15 minks skins (i.e., mothers of the 60 babes that are used to make the coats) to create one coat. So we have 60 baby minks and 15 mothers (or grandmothers if we want to go back in the genealogy of the animal kingdom) to create one coat each.

In the string, the characters \"cat\" are a valid match for the characters \"dog\" in the same pattern.\n\nOutput: 1.) We identify the two patterns in the string: \"cat\" and \"dog\". It's likely that there is an efficient way to compare and check whether the string matches the pattern. However, the question states that the \"strings also include strings with no pattern matches... but the string must always be valid\".\n2.) As a result, we know the string does not match the given pattern and should be invalid.\n3.) By using the second string, we can identify the pattern and compare that to the rest of the string. If we identify that the string contains a pattern, we assign the string to be valid. However, if we find that the string does not contain a patter, we can immediately determine that the string is invalid.\n4.) This process continues iteratively until the string is identified as valid or invalid.\nSo the final step is to check if the string is valid or invalid.\n\n### How do you do this?\n1) For all strings, split the string to make an array called pattern.\n2) Use the for-loop to walk through the pattern array with a character variable, p.\n3) In the for-loop, check whether the character p is anywhere in the string s.\n4) While you are iterating over the for loop, keep incrementing the pointer of the string by 1 to make sure you are checking all possible places.\n5) If the character p is in the string,", "answer": " 1500"}

This means that Omi is twice as old than the oldest is twice as old as Omi. This means Omi is 4 times older than the oldest\n10: Kimiko is twice old as Omi which means Kimiko = (2) (4) = 8 Times Omi\n11: Kimiko is twice older now Omi + Omi + 3/4th = 7 times older than Kimiko.\n12: Kimiko is younger when Omi + Omi is younger than the oldest which is 0.75 times older than Kimiko which means 1.75 Kimiko younger than Omi.

This leaves a total balance of $50. $50 is an integer of the form $1 * 50, so Timothy can choose multiple quantities of keychains (or any other object) to purchase and still stay within his $50 limit. \nTo solve this problem, one should use the mathematical technique of 'divide and conquer'. In this technique, we apply the method of dividing and conquering to the initial equation.

{"text": "1 Lilith's goal is to sell the water bottles at $2 each in order to get enough money to buy the birthday gift according to her initial calculations of $54. How to solve it?\n2. A regular water bottle ($1.85) can be sold $1.85 x 5 dozen = 9 x 5 x 1.85 = $49.25. \n3. Therefore, the regular water bottle prices can be sold for: $49.24. Lilith\u2019s profit for the sold water bottles is $2.76. \n4. According to this question, she needs to sell exactly five dozen in order to get enough to buy her friend the gift. We thus need to see how many water bottles she needs to sell at $2.76 each.\n5. For every whole number sold, she has to sell at $2 and can sell at $2.50 each for the rest. Thus, the $2.76 water bottles are sold as follows: 4 whole 5 x 2 $2; 4 sold at $2.5\n6. 5 x 2.5 \u2013> 12.5 sold at 2.5\n7. 5.25 x 2.76 sold at 2.76\n8.

{"text": "1) The question asks for the total number of animals that Anthony and Leonel have as pets.\n2) First, we need to find how many more leonel has than Anthony. This may help in determining the correct method to use in our math. \n3) We can start by counting how many cats each of them have. \n4) Anthony has 12. 1 cats + 1 cats = 2 cats. So Anthony has 10 cats. \n5) Leonel has 16 more cats than Anthony. 10 + 16 = 26 cats. \n6) Now, we need to count how many dogs each of them have. Leonel has 3 more dogs than Anthony. 7 + 4 = 11 dogs. \n7) Using this information, we can then solve for the number of animals each of them have. Anthony has 26 cats and 4 dogs. 10 + (2/3)*26 = 26 animals. Leonel has 7 cats and 11 dogs. (11 + 1/2)*16 = 57 animals.\n8) Adding the two answers together gives us 57 + 26 = 83 animals.\n\n\nHence, the total number of animals the two of them have is 83.", "answer": " 27"}

However, the question then asks about those 12 cents, stating that John got 4 cents of change.\n4)Looking at the options, option A, (12 + 4) cents doesn't make any sense because that means that the candy bar cost 8 cents (which is not true as 8 cents would exceed what you could buy with the given amounts of coins). In order to subtract 4 cents, we must either have a zero and a 12, or a zero and a 6.

Of her siblings, the one that has the least amount of tokens will likely be either the last or closest to the last sibling.\n6) This means that, if Sandy's sibling with the fewest tokens wants the same amount of tokens that each of their siblings has,\nthen the following formula should hold true: # of tokens in Sandy's wallet - # of tokens in Sandys siblings wallets = # of tokens in that particular sibling's wallet.(IMPORTANT NOTE: the formula is the exact number of tokens in Sandy\u2019s wallet minus the exact number of tokens that each of Sandy\u2019s siblings currently have = the exact number of tokens remaining in that particular sibling\u2019s wallet.)\n7) It should be noted that, for her fourth token, Sandy subtracts the total number of tokens her siblings have from her own total so that she ends up with her next sibling's half of her tokens.

{"text": "1. The answer is the question is asking how many people a vampire needs to'suck' (drink blood from) each day to survive. \n2. This question requires a little math to solve. First, we start by looking at the question. We can immediately see the quantity \"7 gallons\" is a sub-measurement, which means it is less than \"gallons\" and more than \"pint.\" Given this information, we can eliminate 2 from the question, as it can't be the unit of measure. This leaves us with 'gallons' (which is a gallon) and 'pints' (which is a pint). We also know the unit is not 'quarts' which would require 3 pints (again, given this answer is sub-unit) since the number of pints needed is 2.\n3. The question tells us they suck 7 gallon per week. So, 7/7 gal/per weak is 1 gallon/week (since 1 gal/per/week=1, 4 gal/per/week = 4, and so on).\n4. The question also tells us that 2 pints is equal to 1 gallon, so they will need 2 pints per person.\n5. The first 7 gallons divided the number of pints they need will yield your answer. \n6. In this case, they need 7 divided by 2 pints, which is 3.5 pints per person to survive.\nSo the final, correct answer is 3.5 people per day.", "answer": " 4"}

John has determined that he needs 25 of these mats and the store charges around $5 each. What should he do?\nOutput:\nAssume firstly that x = # of mats needed\nLet Sx and S3 be the average cost of each style.\nThen total cost = Sx x # of mats.\nThus, cost of 25 mats = Sx (1 + 25)\nTherefore, total cost = 5(S3 + S4 + S3)\nLet d = difference between S3 and S4.\nThen\n\ncost = 5(S4 + 3d + 3d)\n\nTherefore, the total cost of new mats = 5(28 + 6d + 6d).\n\nAfter calculating T = 5(22 + 12 + 12), substituting in for 'T', rearranging the equation becomes: 5d = S2 - S4.\n\nThus, the price of mats is $2.25 per style.\n\nSo, John should opt for the cheaper option and get 25 mats, of which we need to take one that includes the cheaper choice.  \nNote that 25 can be reduced to 5, which means he has to pay $2 for each mat.\nThus the final answer is:\nHe should get a mat that costs $2, if it is the cheaper option.\n\nInput: In 1974, a law was passed requiring that all gasoline be blended with 10% ethanol.

{"text": "1) The question is a classic brainteaser in which you are given information about three buckets containing various fruits and must combine this information to answer the question: \"How many pieces of fruit are there in all 3 bucks?\"\n2) The key to solving this puzzle is to evaluate the options and combine them based on the given information. In this case, this means evaluating how many pieces of fruit each bucket holds, and then determining how many are in each of the other two buckets based on this information.\n3) Let's begin with bucket A, which holds 4 more pieces of fruits than bucket B, and bucket B, which holds 3 more pieces of fruits that bucket C. Using this information, we can easily determine that either bucket A or B holds 7 pieces of fruit not present in bucket C. Then, we can answer the original question by deducting the number of fruit present in bucket C (9) from the total number of pieces of fruit in bucket A or B (7 + 1 - 9).\n4) As an example, let's consider bucket A. According to the given information, bucket A has 13 pieces of fruit not present. In that case, the formula for our answer would be 9 - (13 -4) = 5. As another example, let's also consider bucket B. According to the given answer, bucket B also has 13 pieces fruit not present in bucket B. In that case, our formula would be 9 - 13 + 3 = 9.

For example, we know that there are 8 parrots and the zoo has 3 times more sn anks than parrots and also two times more monkeys than snake. This tell us there's a constraint on the number of snakes for each of those groups.

{"text": "1) This question is asking: If I\u2019m buying goodie bags for a class and need them to be personalized, how do I minimize my cost given the restrictions I\u2019ve stated?\n2) The first thing to do is figure out the cost of each option and each type being offered. The initial setup tells us that a package of 5 vampire-themes costs $3, and 5 pumpkin costs $3. So, it costs a little over $3 for vampires and over $3 for pumpkins (a total of $6.50).\n3) Next, we have to figure out how many students want each type. We see that 11 students want vampires, and 14 want pumpkins. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that we are given the numbers of students that want the bags; we don\u2019t know how many in total that want both themes.\n4) Now, we have to combine information to get our answer. According to the question, the teacher has to buy the kids the kind they want. We won\u2019t know the total number of students that want both bags, but we can figure it out by adding the total number of students with each option.\nA student could get 3 vampire bags (or 3 pumpkin bags), so that means it\u2019s possible for the teacher to buy a student either 3 vampire or 3 pumpkin bag. Therefore, we can count that 12 students want both (3 x 4).\n5) Now we can do the math. We want to minimize cost, so we want to buy only what each student wants. The total cost is $15 (3 x $4.50 + 3 x $4.80).\n6) We also know that the cost of a vampire- or pumpkin-theme package is $3, and an individual is $1. The cost per student (for an individual) is $2. Therefore, if a student wants both themes, there will be a $3.50 savings.\n7) Putting it all together, we can get the following equation: 14 students that want pumpkins + 14 students that request pumpkins + 3 students that want pumpkin and vampire bags = $6.", "answer": " 17"}

{"text": "1) The question asks us to determine how many loaves Jim can bake based on the information provided.\n2) We need to understand the amount of flour required for a loaf of bread (200g) and the remaining amount of flour (900g).\n3) There are three pieces of information about the flour: the total amount in the cupboard (200g), the amount on the counter (100g), and the amount in the pantry (100g).\n4) To determine how many loaves can be baked, we can start by subtracting 900g from 1000g, which would be the total amount of flour (200g + 100g + 200g). This would leave a remainder of -100g.\n5) Let's assume that -100g is the amount of loaves that can be baked, meaning that the remaining 200g +100g is already the amount needed for 2 loaves.\n6) The next step would be to calculate the total number of loaves that can bake with the remaining flour, which we would simply subtract -100g from 200g since there is now -100g of remaining flour.\n7) Let's say that, in this example, the total is now 200g/(-100g) = 11 loaves that can be made.\n8) So, in conclusion, Jim can bake 11 loaves of bread with the remaining flour.\nSo the final solution is\nJim can bake 10 loaves of bread with 200g flour but needs 200g+100g+11000g flour", "answer": " 2"}

For simplicity's sake, let's rename these cheeses to be ExpensiveCheese and CheapCheese. \n2)Next, determine the amount of each ingredient. We know the final amount of charcuterie to be made, and since cheddar cheese and cream cheese are both cheeses, the ratio of cheddar-to-cheese will determine the actual ingredient ratios. In this case, the ratio is one-to-two (since both types of cheese account for one-half total ingredients). Thus, the quantity of each ingredient is 2 pounds of chesdar cheese, 1 pound of creamcheese, and a pack (2 pounds) of cold-cuts\n3) Next, determine the expenditure of each ingredient, excluding cold-cuts. Since the cold-cuts cost twice the total cost for the cheddar and cream-cheese, we can determine the cheapest type of cheese to be CheapCheese and the most expensive cheese to be ExpensiveCheeses. In this example, a pack of cold-cuts cost $24, which also breaks down to be $12 per pound of cold-cuts. Therefore, the total amount spent on the cheeses is $10 (expensive) + $10 (expansive) + $24 (cold-cuts) = $44. \n4) Now that we have all the necessary data, we can reconstruct the question: If Jasper is buying cheese with the intention of making charcuterie and will spend a total of $44 on ingredients, how much will he spend on cheese? \n5) The answer is then $44 / (1 + $12 / $24) = $12\n6) Thus, the final answer is $12.\n\n# Solution to this problem\n\n\ndef solution(string): \n    return 1 if string == \"B: tailor shop\" else 0", "answer": " 35"}

We know that he earns $33 as he mows the lawn.\n3. The customers each gave him a tip of $30, and we also know that each customer gave him a $1 tip. This means that he got to keep $30 of the total tips, $30.\n4. So, we can say that Lee mows one lawn, charges $33 to do the lawn, and keeps $30 from the $63 of combined tips from the 16 lawn customers and the three single people whose total tips amount to $33.\n5. Therefore: $33 + $30 = $63 (total tips) \n6. $33 + $13 + $13 = $63 (Total amount mowed by Lee and tips of each customer) \n7. So, Lee earns $33 + $20 = $53.\n8.

{"text": "1) The question asks the number of books borrowed in a week if the books are made available for borrowing by the library on Monday and closed at Friday (assuming no Saturday or Sunday). \n2) Given the data, we can see that the first number (on Monday) is 40, the second number is 53 (53% higher than 40) and the third number is 64 (64% higher than 53). Likewise, the fourth number is 74 (74% higher than 64) and the fifth (and last) number is 85 (85% higher than 74).\n3) Given these numbers, we can create this formula: 85 - day 1 = day n. Then solve for day 1 by: 40 + (85 - day 54% of 40) = 85(1 + 0.4) - Day 1 = Day 1 -> Day 1 = 40. Now, solve for n by: -40 = Day n = 54% of Day 1 = Day n = 22.5\n4) Given the formula: 85 + 22.5 = Day n, the next step is divide both sides by 54: 1.6 = Day n. 54 * 1.6 = 90, giving us the answer of 90 as the number of books borrowing every week(on Monday).", "answer": " 216"}

'A' does not make sense as a reason to be successful, it only makes sense to avoid being unsuccessful. 'B' doesn't make sense for being successful either. Being happy while we're unsuccessful is not inherently better than being happy while being successful. \n3: Option C seems to be the best fit. It describes being successful as a way to alleviate the stress of being a failure. \n4: Thus, the solution is 'C'.\nSo the final answer for this question is C: to avoid the stressed and discomfort caused of being a failure\n\nInput: What does the person want, since they will eat only if their stomachs are full?

{"text": "Given the question statement, you can see that there will be a fixed number of cones given away, but the answer to the question \"how many\" will depend on the actual value of the order.\n1. The first thing to do is to look at the statements and eliminate obviously invalid scenarios such as the total value of the order being equal to zero. This is trivially true for the first statement since $100 is less than the total number of cones Dan would sell.\n2. Next, we can observe that the denominator of the fraction of free cone amounts is even. This means that Dan would always give away free cones, regardless of how much was sold.\n3. Once we know that Dan would always make free cones regardless of how much he sold, eliminating the second statement is a no-brainer. This is because you can determine the value of an unknown variable by manipulating known variables.\n4. Substituting the unknown, x, into the second statement and simplifying yields x/(x+6). Taking the numerator and denominator to simplest form yields x - x/6 + 1. Setting the coefficients, 1 and 6, to zero when x is substituted yields x = 7.\n5. This means that the value of x, the answer to the question of how many cones Dan would sell, is seven.

With each additional year, the total height increases by another 10%. So, we have to multiply h as it grows: h1 = 10% of 100 = 10 \n5. For the end of the 2nd year, h2 = 10% \\* 110 = 11.0 (rounded down)\n6. For the end of year 3, h3 = 10%/12 = 0.8.\n7. And finally at the end of year 4, h4 = 0.8% of 121 = ~11.0. \n8.

{"text": "First, lets get an overall grasp of the problem. \n 1.  By the time Anne is twice as old as Emile (age: x), Emile will be 6 times as old as Mauve (age: y). \n 2. Since the given times can be written as the ratio (x/y), this can be simplified to 2:1 and 6:1.\n 3. Now lets analyze the variables. \"Anne\" could refer to the person whose age is being calculated (or someone else), but let's assume it is Maude for simplicity.\n 4. \"Emile\" can't be referred to as Mary (Anne's friend) since her age has already been established. Further, \"Maude\" doesn't match any known person's age in the problem, so it cannot hold any meaning. This means that \"Anne\", \"Emile\", and \"Maude\" are references to 3 people (Anne, Emile, and Mary). \n 5. \"Mauve\" isn't a person, so it cannot hold meaning. What could it refer to? It could be a color, or it could be another animal. This will be determined later.\n 6. Anne's age is unknown (thus referred to as \"x\" for unknowns), but we could use known information to determine what that might be: Anne will be 2 times as old as Emille, so that number times 2 = Maude's age, or Emille's age minus 2. We know that Emille's age is given and Mauve's age is the desired result. We can use these provided numbers to solve for the age of Anne: 6*Emillie's age - 2 = Mauve's age. So Anne's age is: 6E - 2 = 8 Since 6E - 6 = 0, we add the two numbers and get: 6(E-2) = 8. Since E-2 and 8 are prime numbers, we divide the whole expression by the GCF, or greatest common factor. The GCF is 1 since we can't have anything left, making the quotient 6/1, which reduces to 6/6. The answer is 6/6.\nSo the final result is x = y =", "answer": " 96"}

A number of students who do read novels are (7 + 5 x 1/2)(50.00% + 51.00%)\n3. The 6 is given, the 240 is the total number of students, and 3+1+1/2+5 is 5/3 or 1.666666 that 1/6\n4. To simplify this into numbers, we have: 1/6 of 240 = 40\n\n5. Therefore, 1/6 of the 240 students read 3 or more books per month, that makes the number of students that don't read books = 200.", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "First, determine what information is available. We know that five months ago, Mike earned $10x as much as Fred. Because the word \"than\" is often used to describe ratios in this context, we can assume that Mike earned $100 more than Fred. We also know that Mike's salary has increased by a factor of 40% within that time frame. If there's an increase of 40% in total salary, that means that each month he now earns an additional $40. If he earned $100 in the previous month, now that he is being paid $140, that means he earned $40 more than he did the previous month. In order to calculate Fred's salary, we need to first find Mike's salary. Mike's salary is $140. There is a range of answers for Fred's salary. Fred earned $1000. The question does not specify what type of increase we are describing, so this could be an increase in percentage or a fixed amount. If it were a percentage, then 40% for Fred would mean that $1000=1000(1.4), which is $1400. If the question describes a fixed increase of 100/1000, it would mean Fred could earn up to $1100. The most reasonable solution in both those scenarios is that Fred earns $1100, and consequently the salary of each man is $140 and $1100 respectively. \n\nHence, the final answer is A. $1100\n\nInput:When is a day of the work?

{"text": "The first way of tackling this scenario is to identify the overall rate of question creation and apply it to all 3 hours.  We can do this by:\n\n-Assuming that the number of math questions Bob created in the first hour (30 questions) is Bob's rate in the first hour.\n-Similarly, 60 questions (2 * 30) are created in the second hour.\n-Then this rate would apply to the third hour (6 * 60).\n\nHence, Bob created a total of 90 math questions in 3 hours. If we are trying to figure out Bobby's average rate:\n\n-His rate from the first hour is (13/60) = 0.22\n-His rate in the second hour is (26/360) = 1/9 \u2248 0.11\n-His rate for the third hour is (58/2880) = 10/192\n\nTherefore, Bobby's average rate was (0.22 + (0.11*2) + (10/193)) = \u2248 0.44\n\nAnother way to tackle this scenario is to calculate how many questions Bobby created in each hour.  Then we can figure out the average rate Bob had in each hour based on how many questions he created in each hour with his overall rate.  We can do that by:\n\n-Calculating 13 + 26 + 58 questions.\n-These are the overall questions Bob created in the three hours.\n-Then, we can figure out how many questions Bobby created an hour by dividing the overall number of questions by the total number of hours.  Therefore, we can conclude that Bobby created an average of 24 questions per hour.\nThus, we can conclude that the total number of math questions Bob creates in 3 hours is 24 * 3 =  72 questions.\nHence the solution is:\n24 * 3\n12 questions created in the first hour, 24 each in the second and third hour\nHence, Bobby created 72 math questions in all three hours.\n\n\nOutput: What is the product of (4 * 5 + 13) multiplied by (2 *", "answer": " 91"}

{"text": "1. I started off by looking at what Kantana bought and how much it cost, which was 30 chocolates. Then I realized that this number wouldn't make sense because each Saturday she only bought 15 chocolates. Knowing how much she bought on average each week, I started to look at the amount she picked up that week. \n2. I knew that Kantana always picked up 2 chocolatlies for herself and 1 chocolate for her sister. That means at the most she would only need 9 chocolates, which is the average amount she picks up with her sister. \n3. In looking at the other weeks in her month, I noticed that she would get more chocolates if her friend Charlie's birthday falls in the middle of the month. This is because Kantana only buys chocolate for her friend once a month. \n4. What I concluded from the above was that the last Saturday of Kantana's month, or the birthday week, is 10, which is the most Kantana will ever have to buy. \n5.  Knowing that, I took every week in her month, multiplied it by Kantana's average amount of pickups for each week, and subtracted the 15 chocolate average. This would mean that I had 38 chocolates minus 15 (twice) which equals 25 + 5 + 4 = 34. \n6. As Kantana always has to pay for 32 chocolates, subtracting 34 would result in 50 extra chocolates for Kantana. \n7. This is the final result because Kantana always gets 25 chocolates for her sister and 5 chocolates, at most for her friend. At the most, Kantana buys 50 chocolates = I bought (30-15). + (5-15). + 5.\nSo the final sum is 50 + 5 + 5 = 55.", "answer": " 22"}

Since the sandbox is a rectangle, we can assume that the width is at least 5 feet long. By combining the solutions, we know the width of the sand box is between 5 and 15 feet.\n7. Finally, by eliminating the outliers between 15 and 30, the width of the sand bar is 10 feet which fits into the equation given.\nSo the final solution is B: width = 10ft (7.6 feet/1ft)\n\nInput: What can someone do that can cause them to be very excited?

Choices: A: 10 B: 5 C: 6 D: 4 E: 3\nOutput: 1: The trick is to recognize that the numbers 234, 735, and 131 are prime, and the numbers 10, 5, 6, and 4 are not. 2. Since the minimum number of letters represents how many additional letters will make the final number not prime, but instead composite, we can narrow down the choices to just prime numbers that sum to the number of letters the final number has. 3. The only option that works for all the numbers that the final number is composed of is A: 10. 4. 234 minus 10 equals 224. 735 minus 10 equals a 725 and 131 minus 10 equals an 121. 5. In our final numbers, we have a prime number divisor, 2, then 224, but we can't have two 10 digit numbers next to each other, so we reduce to 2.4 to make the final result 1234-2-1-2. 6. Since 1234 is prime up to 6, we only reduced 1 and 2, and therefore there were a total of 3 letters and numbers that are composed of these two prime numbers. 7. So, option A gives you the minimum letter and number composition as 10 letters and 3 numbers for a total of 13 prime digits as the final result.\nSo the final A: 10 letters and numbers.\nInput: Average high", "answer": " 736"}

To calculate the answer, let's first determine how much champagne Jackson would be able to get considering a discount is given. We know that each bottle holds 1 quart and costs $50. Since the champagne is sold using quarts rather than gallons, it will cost $50 for 4 quarts.\n3. The discount offers Jackson a 20% reduction in volume, so he receives a discount in gallons, not quarts. Therefore, he receives a 40% reduction in gallons. \n4. With those calculations in mind, Jackman can get 10 bottles of champagne. \n5. Now we can calculate how much chamagne he actually buys.

John is starting from zero, so he adds one rep each day and has 5 days to do it. He can go from zero to 5 reps in one day, or five and go to 10. Then he adds five more for a 10-rep day and repeats it for each rep increase on the next five days. This puts him at 50 days to get to 5 reps.\n3) Consider the rest of the question. John says he will do wall push-ups for 30 days, so he has to progress them from 5 a day to 30 a day. The same logic holds true for low elevation push-up. John can only go from zero to 30 in one day because any day after that can go to as high as 35. Because of this, wall push-ups will last as long as it does, or 30, and he will have to increase his reps from 5 to 35.

{"text": "1 First, we'll have to create a function to define how many sheep can be in a pen and how many can be out in the hills based on the given information that 10% of the sheep were missing. We can do this by first defining an array of 0's and 1's indicating how many of each there are in each 'group'. Then we can write a function called 'totalNumberInPen()' that takes in a parameter 'n'. This function will then define how many sheep are 'inside' the pen based on the information provided. For instance, if n is 23, there would be 3 people inside the pen. Afterwards, we can define the 'total' number of sheep that Carla possesses: 'totalOwned'. This function will simply take in our previous function - that is, it will take in 'totalNumberInPenn()'. Then we can define a function that sums up all the numbers in the array:'sumArrays()'. Finally, we'll put it all together by defining an intermediate variable: 'numSheepInThePen()'. Then we call the two functions together: 'numSheep'.\n2 This will return the number of sheep 'inside' to the pen. Now we need to know the number of sheep Carla does not have in her pen. To know these, we'll define a variable: 'allOfCarlasSheepMissing()'.

The first line of information gives us a general description of the trip; there are 4 stops, total distance 29 miles, and gas price $2.50/gallon\n3. The next line explains the trip more specifically\n4. To determine the total distance of the trip, we need to add the 4 locations together, (8 + 6 + 12 + 2(6+12)) = 50 miles\n5. We then need to determine the total cost of gas for the trip to get the gas price cost/gallon\n6. The first formula to get the cost of gas per mile is simple: gas price/total miles\n7. However, to calculate cost/gallon, we must divide the mileage/gas price by the miles traveled\n8. Taking this into consideration, cost/gallon = ($2.50/$25)/(50/25) = $2.00\n9. Since this is the cost per gallon, we multiply it by the total number of gallons needed to get the total cost for the trip.\n10. To get the total miles, we take the number of stops (4) and multiply it by the distance (50 miles)\n11. 4 * 50 = 200 miles\n12.

{"text": "Answer: 2\nAnswer Explanation: Step 1: Identify the important information The problem asks us to find the number of lego sets that Tonya will buy for her older sister. We are given that Tonya spends the same amount on both her younger and older sister, and she buys her younger sister four dolls at $15 each. From these statements, we can deduce that Tonya has 2 sisters, one older and one younger. Step 2: Plan how to solve After that, let's start by understanding the information given, and coming up with a solution plan. We know that we want to find the number of Legos that Tonya buys for her older sister. However, first we need to find her older sister's age. We know that Tonya has two sisters, and that she is purchasing Legos for the older sister. We can conclude that the cost of a Lego is more than the cost of a dollar. So, we can add up the costs of 4 Legos and 1 Lego, which would be $20 + $15 = $35, and subtract that from the dollar budget, leaving $100 - $35 = $65. Hence, in order to find the number of Lego sets, we just need to divide $65 by $20 and solve for the number of Lego Sets. Step 5: Solve the problem So, dividing $65 by $35 gives us 1.9 Legos for each sister. If we multiply 2 by 1.9, we can get 1.9 \u00d7 2 = 3.8. If we subtract 3.8 from 4, we will get 2.

To use a third one would require a full jar, and for this third jar, the water level would have to be below it; otherwise, it would overflow. Four other jars would also overflow the water inside.

Since Andy is harvesting tomatoes, it makes sense that he would harvest a significant portion of them - so he only leaves a minor amount which we determine in the next step.\n3) The next step is determining what percentage of the tomatoes he leaves. We know that he dries up half of them. Half of the total tomatoes harvested is then 63 or more tomatoes. We also know that he turns 1/3 of the remainder into marina sauce. The remainder of the tomatoes that are left after drying half the tomatoes makes up the remaining 1/3 portion - or 22 tomatoes.\n4) The next step is combining the information from the prior step. We know that there is 22 tomatoes left from the remainder of the tomatoes and Andy left 63 tomatoes. This means the total number of tomatoes left as a result of Andy harvesting half and turning half is 85 tomatoes.\n5) The final step is combining the information in the prior step with determining how many tomatoes Andy produces. We previously determined that there is 126 tomatos and Andy produces 85 tomatoes to have a total of 206 tomatoes.\n\nTherefore, the number of tomatoes Andy harvested is 85.", "answer": " 42"}

We don't know what has to be sold by Tory before the profit would be zero. 2) To find the percentage, we have to use the formula, (rate of change)/ (initial value). 3) The rate of change is difference of the profits made for the each toy. Difference of profits between both the phone and the gun is $2. 4) (r,ate of change) = (difference of profit)/(total of profits).

{"text": "One side of the problem consists of calculating the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the day. However, the problem also states that the drift initially measured 34 inches. This implies that there were multiple steps taken over the course of the 4 days.\n\nLet's start with step 1. Initially, the drift is 34 inches deep. In an ideal case that has no wind, half of the snow will melt from the midday sun on day 2. Therefore, we would be left with a drift that is 17 inches. 6 inches more would add to the drift by the end of day 3. The drift would be 6 inches more than 17 inches, or 23 inches deep. And 18 inches more would add to this number by the end of day four, making the drift 41 inches deep at the end the fourth day.\n\nLet'e represent the final depth of the drift with D and solve for D using the provided numbers and the information at our disposal: D = 41 \u2013 (0.5 * 17) \u2013 (6 * 6) \u2013 (18 *6)\nMultiplying each step of the drift by 6 to include it in all terms: \n\nD = 41 \u2013 [0.5(17)] \u2013 [6(6)] \u2013 [18(6)]\n\nD = 34 + [0.28](34) = 39.28 inches\n\nSo the final answer for the depth of the snow drift on first day is 39.2 inches.\n\n1.\n```python solve.py\nfrom sympy.core.basic import Symbol\n#Create symbols and assign them to the problem \nS1 = Symbol('S1')\nS2 = Symbol('S2')\n\nS1 = -S2\n\ndef solve(S1, S2, a, b, c):\n    print('If S1')\n    A = S1\n    B = S1 + a\n    C = S2 + b\n    D = S2 + c\n    E = A + S2\n    F = B + S2\n    G = C + S2\n    H = D + S2\n    I = E + S2", "answer": " 20"}

At the start of the month, she had $320 ($42*12 + $80). Thus, she contributed $18, which left her with $302 to start the next month.\n5) The second question is her contribution to monthly taxes. Since she was left with $302 after paying $42 for necessities and $80 for taxes, she had to contribute at most $360 for the household taxes in order to finish the month with $0. Hence, her contribution was most likely $360.\n6) The third question is how much her tax contribution was. The last 2 times, she contributed $360 and came to a total of $1,080.

Assuming each day she listened to two hours, the audiobook will be complete in one day. The length of an audiobook is 31:30 if you round it up. \n5) Since you need to figure out how many days you need to complete all six audiobooks, you multiply the six audiobooks by the number of days you need to complete one. In this case, Fernanda requires two days to complete one audiobook, so the value is six times 2, or twelve days.\n6) Then add the first value to the second value, which equals the answer of six days plus twelve days to complete the audiobooks.\n7) So the total time is 18 to three decimal places.\nSo the final result would be A: 18:00:00 to 3 decimal places.", "answer": " 90"}

First, we can eliminate option B, 'garlic', as food used to flavor or season other foods is generally a separate ingredient that is added (rather than being naturally present like salt). \n3.

To solve the problem, we need to understand and follow the process of calculating the remaining portion of kibble left in the bag. Once you have figured out the amount of kibble leftover you will move on to the answer. \n4. The amount of kibble left is found by: Total amount of kibble consumed/Total amount of kibble in bag.\n5. The total amount of kibble that should last Luna a month is 24 cups of kibbles (24 = 12+12)\n6. Since kibbles are always measured in cups, any remaining amount will also be listed in cups.\n7. First, we need to calculate the total amount of kibbles that should last Luna for a month (24).\n8. Next we calculate and record the amount of kibbles Mary feeds Luna every day (1.5)\n9. We add the numbers together and get a total amount of kibbels Luna \"should\" get every day:\n10. After Mary gives Luna the morning and evening kibbles she is still left with 6 kibbles (2 cups = 15, so 6 = 15 - 9).\n11. Next Frank gives her 6 more kibbles (12+6=18).\n12.

Now that we've eliminated the non-answer choices, we can use basic math to determine the amount of \"x\". Option B, \"fresh that are good\", is 60% of \"x\", so 60% of a number is \"x\". Option D can be simplified to: \"not good\". If \"x\" is 250 and 60% of 250 is 150, then 100 (60% of 150) is not good. We add the 150 to get to 250, and the 100 to get to 150. 5.

We can assume that Bill put the fries in before the oven finished heating in order to fully cook them.\n3. According to the question, the recommended time for cooking the fries is 5 minutes. We can assume that the cooking time starts once the oven is fully heated, which took 45 seconds.\n4. However, it is still unclear how many seconds remained after the 45 seconds heating time was over.\n5. One strategy is to find the difference in elapsed time between the start of cooking and Bill's action of putting the fries in the ovens.\n6. Alternatively, we can find the difference in oven temperature between the start of cook and Bill's action.\n7. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so we can say that 60% of a minute passed.\n8. Also, assume the oven temperature 325 degrees F and the fries were in the oven for x seconds.  We know that cooking times are dependent on oven temperature.\n9. Using the formula C1 / T1 = C2 / T2, to figure out how many more seconds the fries need to be fully cooked we get 28 / 325 = 87 / (T + 45)  10. To figure out how many  seconds the fries need, we will take the product of these terms, divide by 5 (minutes), and subtract the result from 451 to account for the 5 minutes Bill spent waiting before cooking.\n11. 0.9 - (451 / 5) = 712 / (T + 5) = seconds left.\n12. Using the formula C(T + 5) / T1 = x / 28 we can solve for T.\n13. T = 712 * 28 /x\n14. T = 19464\n15.

The question requires us to identify the last letter of the fifth vertical row of a word search puzzle. \n2. We can use logical reasoning to eliminate most possibilities. It is unlikely that we would find the letter \"W\" at the beginning or middle of a vertical row since it is the third-to-last letter in the word \"WORD\" (which is typically the middle of a word in a word search puzzle). \n3. This provides us strong evidence that we should eliminate letters \"W\" as a starting point for our search. \n4. Additionally, the letters \"W\" and \"R\" in combination share their first three letters. Thus, we can further narrow our search by eliminating letter \"R\" as well. \n5.

Option B - the trucking company is unlikely as it is more likely that it would be bought directly from an oil company or refinery.\n5.) Option C - the oil company is unlikely as it would imply that the individual seeking heating oil would be seeking it directly from the oil company.\n6.) Option D - the refinery is unlikely to be the first port of call for someone seeking heating oil, as it is likely they would purchase it from the oil company. \n7.)

{"text": "1The question is asking how many more tickets Jeanne should buy to ride all three rides.\n2Let's say there are three possible answers to the question: 'A', 'B', and 'C'. \n3The cost of the Ferris wheel is the same as the cost of the bumper cars, i.e., 5. The cost of the rollercoaster is 4. \n4If we choose an option that requires'more tickets', it needs to give us a value that is greater than 5; otherwise it is not a valid option. \n5Therefore, options B and C cannot be valid. \n6'Options A' and 'B' both require a value that is greater then 5, and so they are acceptable possibilities. However, option B requires 7 tickets and option A requires 11 tickets. \n7Therefore, you can eliminate option A because it is more expensive. \n8Let's now consider option B. Option B says'more tickets' need to be bought to ride all three rids, but it does not specify a number. Since this statement leaves us with an uncertain quantity, it does not seem likely to be a possible solution. Therefore, we should rule out option B. \n9The only option left is 'Option A'. Jeanne should buy 4 more tickets, or 9 tickets in total, to ride all three riddes.\nSo the final option is A: buy 4 more tickers\n\nInput: What will happen if 0 and \u00bd is subtracted?

{"text": "1.) The statement: \"Nadia walked 28 kilometers, which is twice the distance that Hannah walked.\" indicates a problem involving multiplication.\n2.) The first step in solving any multiplication problem is writing out the equation. Let's call the total number of kilometers all the girls walked \"N\". The total number the girls walked will be equal to N * (Nadia walked N/2), or N * (2Nadia).\n3.) Using the equation, we can determine the total number the girls walked. This is (36N) * 2 (2Nadi). From this, the total number of kilomers the girls walked is 72N.\n4.) To determine the answer that makes most sense, we can compare the values we found in the previous step with the answer choices.

{"text": "1. The first step in identifying the correct answer is understanding the question correctly. In this case, we are told that Eugene built a model house with 52 cards and 18 decks of playing cards, using 75 toothpick per card and 50 fewer cards for each model house, therefore we must use 52 cards and use 50 cards with the same structure in each of 18 decks. \n2. Since Eugene used 52 cards, then used 16 cards remaining, which would give us 36 cards per box of toothpics. With this number, multiply it by 18 and you get 16x36 which is equivalent to 576 cards per box. Now that we're equipped with Eugene's method, let's try and figure out how many boxes he needed. \n3. First we identify the quantity of 'c' needed for 52 (decks of cards used). Next, we determine the number of boxes used by applying the formula 576 = 75x52 to yield the answer of 11.

{"text": "In order to answer this question, we need our first step to be determining the total mass of fruit that needs to be harvested. \n1. First let's examine the number of apples: Since each apple tree produces 150kg of apples, we have 150 kg x 30 = 4500 kg of apples.\n 2. Next, let's add the number of peaches produced by the peach trees: Because each peach tree can produce 65kg of fruit on average, we have 8250 kg of peaches coming from the 45 peach orchards (65 x 45 = 2975 kg).\n 3. Putting the results of the two parts together, we now have the total number of kg of fruit in the orchard:\n 4. 8250 (kg of peaches) + 4500 (kg of apples) = 12750 kg of total fruit harvested.\n 5.

{"text": "To begin with, let's look at the problem statement to help clarify what we're looking for. The words 'perimeter' and'square' tell us that the answer should be a number. The phrase'square-shaped piece of [something]' suggests that we need to solve for the sides of a square, so the answer is not an angle or direction. Therefore, the answer is a number and this problem is purely algebraic.\n\n1. Since the perimeter of the paper is shorter than the computer screen, it makes sense that 20cm may not be sufficient height for the entire computer screen.\n2. To calculate the height of a computer monitor on a paper square, we need to find the fraction of the height of the square that would be necessary to cover the computer screen.\n3. To find the fraction of the width that would be necessary to fit the computer screen, we can make use of the properties of squares. If the width of the square is 20cm and it has an area of 20cm^2, it means that each side is 20cm. It also means that 20cm is the same as the length and the height, which means it's a square.\n4. Hence, our answer is 20cm^3/20, which tells us that each side of the square of paper should be 10cm tall.\n\nInput: If a person is able to identify a number of trees and a flower, how will a machine identify these same things?\nOutput: One possibility is that the machine will use image recognition to identify the images of the same things (trees and flowers) it was shown.

{"text": "1) Lets consider the equation in the problem: We have a compound with a population of animals, including 20% fewer dogs and twice as many frogs. \n2) To solve the equation, lets simplify each variable to its lowest common denominator. For the number of dogs, it is equal to 0.8 * 160. and for the number of frogs, it is equal to  2 * 160 (as there are twice as many frogs than dogs). Thus, the equation simplifies to 0.8*160 = 128 dogs and 160 (2*160=240 frogs). \n3) Now, we need to plug in the variables to calculate the total number of animals in the compound. Thus the equation becomes: 128 + 240 = 368 total animals.\n4) Solving the equation using cross-multiplication, we can solve the problem:  368 = (0.8)(368). The answer is 368 which corresponds to 368 animals in the compound, including 160 (368/2) frogs and 128 (368/8=16)  dogs. \nSo the final answer with correct options is A:160, 128, 368", "answer": " 304"}

{"text": "I: The first sentence provides us with information about John climbing three staircases, each with a different number of steps and a varying number of stairs. \nII: We are interested in how many feet John climbed. \nIII: The information given to us is: 20 steps to the first staircase, 2X the number of steps to the next staircase, and 10 fewer steps to the final staircase. \n1. To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of steps and the number of stairs to the staircase.  We know that the 2X step increases the number of stairs by 2.  With this information, we can identify the relationship between any number of steps, or stairs, to any other number of steps or stairs and determine how many feet John climbs. \n2. For example, if John climbs 14 steps, in the first staircase he climbs how many feet? The answer would be 20 steps. Thus, 20 feet. This is shown by the equation 20 = 1.4 (2X steps multiplied by 1). \n3. Now that we have figured out the relationship between the number steps and the number of the same staircases, we can use the equation again to see if John climbs the same number of steps again, or he climbs 16 steps, how many feet does that get him? The answer would be 12 feet using the same equation. \n4. Let's now consider the final 10 stairs. If John climbs one more staircase, how many feet could John have climbed? The answer is 10 fewer feet.  So, if he climbs 11 more stairs, he climbs 10 fewer feet which would be 0 feet. This is demonstrated by the equation 11 + -10 = 1 feet.. \n5. At the final step, if John does not climb anymore stairs, what is the number of stairs he climbs? The answer would be zero since we added 0 feet.  The equation 0 + 1.4 = 1 (2X steps multiplying by 1), we get 1 feet.  This is the answer to the problem \"how many feet did he clim\u0431?\"", "answer": " 45"}

{"text": "1)The statement is read as \"Caleb and Cindy are filling their inflatable pool with [water] by using the buckets. They fill the buckets at the spout and carry them to the swimming pool. Caleb is able to add 7 gallons [per trip] for his bucket and Cindy is able to add 8 gallons [per trip]. It [the swimming pool] should be filled with 105 gallon of water. How many trips do the buckets need to fill the swimming pool?\"2) The question is asking the number of buckets full of water are Caleb and Cindie going to need to fill up their swimming pool with water.3) Given that, the first thing we need to note is that each time both Caleb and Cindi fill a bucket with water, each person is able to fill a bucket with 7 or 8 gallons of water.4) To find out how many trips it will take for Caleb to fill up the swimming pool, we can start by subtracting each bucket capacity, that is, both Caleb's bucket, which holds 7 gallon of water, and Cindi's bucket, which also holds 7 gallon, from 105. We get\n  ( 105 - 7  )  = 98 galls [of water] per trip. Since we know Caleb has seven gallons to fill in his buckets, he would take 15 trips.5) To find the number of trips for Cindi, we can use the same strategy, subtracting each bucket capacity for both Caleb' and Cindi, that is, Caleb's 7 gallons, and Cindi' 8 gallons, from 108 gallons we need to fill for them in the swimming pool [with two buckets]. We get\n  (\n        108 - ( ( 7 + 8 ) ) )\n         = 100 gallons per trip\nsince we are talking about filling up two buckets [one for Caleb and one for Cindi] per trip, Cindi would take an additional two trips.6) Therefore 15 + 2 for Caleb and two more for Cindi is our answer for the total number of trips it would", "answer": " 7"}

There is a box full of five black balls, two white balls, and three green balls.\n2. We will draw four balls randomly and without replacement.\n3. Considering four different ways to choose balls from the box, there is 1 way to choose 5 different balls.\n4. However, since there is only one white ball and one green ball in the box, there are only 2 ways to select only two balls of the same colour.\n5. In this manner, there are 13 possible unique permutations of four balls chosen without replacement.\n6. We can see that at least two of these sets of four balls must be chosen without replacement. Since there are only two sets, only white and green balls, we will choose at least one of these balls. Therefore, the answer is at least 13/2 = 6,5:56.\n7. We will calculate the exact probability of at least two balls of different colours being drawn from our box by using the binomial distribution. The probability of drawing two balls of the same size out of four balls is 1/4; therefore, the probability of drawing two different colours from any four balls is 10", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "1) The information is given as a comparison. Therefore, the first step is to identify the total number of stamps that Bella purchased. \n2) We can first compare the information about the snowflake and the rose stamps. Stamp A has Snowflake stamps and is purchased 11 more times than Rose stamps. By similar reasoning, we can conclude that B had at least 11 Snowflake sticks. That is stamps A to J is one of the possible answers.\n3) In order to find the exact answer, a few more calculations need to be done. At the start, let Y be the total number of sticks that Bella bought. The number of snowflake sticks is 11 + S, where S is greater than 0, that is, A to J \u2265 12. The number of truck sticks is 9 + T \u2212 S (T \u2265 9) and the number of roses is 13 \u2212 2 * (s \u2013 T). At this point, the value of (s \u2013 T) is not known, but the value for (s \u2013 T) may be calculated. 2 (s \u2013 T) = 13 \u2013 18 = -5, that is, (s \u2013 t) = 5. If we substitute the 5 in the previous equation, the equation becomes: the number of truck stamps is 9 + 9 + T \u2013 8 S \u2013 5 = 14 + (9 \u2013 5) + t = 14 + 4 + T.

We will find Mr. Benson's overall cost by finding f(x) = xr/100. Mr. B will always be able to buy 10 tickets for $400, since that is equal to xr/10=40. To find Mr. B's cost, we must find the function f(x) = 40(x/10) = 40mx where x, and m are constants. We solve for m by rearranging to find m = 1.

We can see that this is a proportion, and so we can find two rates: 15/25 = x/60   [remember: 1 x 60 = 60]  15/25  = x/60; 25 = 60x   25 = 6\n1.666667 = x\nso x = 40\n2. We are told that Leo took twice as long to complete part 2 of his assignment (in comparison to how he finished his part 1 assignment). To find out, we can use this information along with the fact that Leo completed part 1 in 25 minutes and multiplied by it (note: 25 is the amount of time Leo initially took to complete part 1, in minutes). 0.5 = 2 * 25(15/25) (300/25)\n7.2 = ____  7.2 = 28.8  28.8 = 4   88 minutes (0.88) = 100 minutes  88(15/2) = 150  100 = 150\n3. So the solution to our problem is found to be 40 minutes.\nSo the final outcome is 40 minutes\n\n\n\n## [Back](./index.md#back)", "answer": " 45"}

The first step is determining if there are any constraints on this problem. For instance, the question doesn't mention if our $4 and $6 are fixed amounts they make or if it is an hourly rate at which they make money and decide to multiply that by the number of hours they work. It's not mentioned that Sally and Bob both work at the same jobs. We will base our calculation on the assumption they only work one job each. 3. We assume Bob and Sally work one day every week for their entire year, since we cannot see anything in the question to indicate that they are working multiple days a week. 4. After multiplying by $4 our entire year, we have: Sally $288 Bob $208 Now we multiply $4 the entire year together: Both $976 \n5. We repeat the process mentioned in step 4 for Sally and Bob.

We can solve for both values of x and z using the substitution property on both equations:\n$x$ and $z$ substituted for $x+z-1$:\n$$P(z-1)=0 \\rightarrow (z-1)P = 0 \\\\ P = 1/(z-1) $$\nFor $z$ substitutes for $z$:\n$$xP + (z-1) P = 0 \\\\ z-1P = 0 \\\\ zP = 0 $$\n6.

{"text": "The first step is to understand what the question is asking. It asks, given that certain information about a car's gas tank and mileage is known, how many more gallons of fuel must be added to this specific car to travel an estimated 600 miles. \n1. The next step is to analyze the options for question-answer pairs. \n2. The first answer, A: 600+400 = 1000, is simply incorrect, since it would require the car to have 40 gallons to travel 601 miles.\n3. The next answer option, B: 4 (400-20)*6, is also incorrect. Rounding out the rest of the trip with an extra 4 gallons means that the car would need another 604 gallons, which is far too much.\n4. The remaining option, C: 28 gallons, is correct because if the car has 8 gallon of gas left, and travels 400 miles to get about 600 miles altogether, then the car needs 28 more gallons to travel \n6 more miles (5 times 500 miles, the halfway point of the trip, or the equivalent to 600-400). \n\nSo the final answer can be C: 28", "answer": " 52"}

Since it's not the fifth scroll, it's half as old as the 648th scroll. Hence, it's half of 648+120 = 768 years old.

Here's an equation to find how many insulin pills Holly can take in a day.\n\nNumber of insulin pills she takes per day = 2 / dayNumber of days in a week = 7 days\n\nAs Holly takes 2 insulin shots per day, she can only use 2 out of only 7 bottles of insulin shots.\n\nAnd since she takes 7 bottles per week, and she uses 2 everyday, she can only use one bottle per day.\n\nSo from the above equation, we can say, Holly takes 2 bottles of insulins in a week.\n\nNow, you're halfway done.\nHere's an equation to tell how many blood pressure pills she takes in one week.\n\nNumber of blood pressure pills she can take per day = 3 / dayNumber of days = 7 days.\n\nSo she can only use 3 bottles of blood pressure pills in a week.\nThe same is the case with anticonvulsants.\n\nAnd since you have calculated the number of insulin pots she takes per day,\nuse this number to calculate the number of blood pressure pills Holly takes in a day and anticonvulsants she takes in one day.\n\nSince Holly takes 2 inulin potions in a week, she would take 4 blood pressure pills and 8 anticonvulsants in a day.\nMultiply this number by 7, and we will get the final answer: 108.\nSo the final solution is: 108 pills per week.", "answer": " 77"}

{"text": "The first step is to know what you're looking for, which is all the judges that are over 50. 1. The first portion of the question asks about the percentage of judges under 30.  2. The next part asks about the percentage of Judges in the 30-55 year range. 3. The last part mentions Judges over 55. \n4. 10% of judges are under 35 years old. 60% of judges (not under 30 nor 35 years old) are over 50, and the rest of the Judges (who are not over 55) are older than the 30-35 age range.\n\n1. Thus, we want all judges over 55, and divide by the sum of all Judges (30-55 and older than 55).  2.\n5. To determine the number of Judges over 51, we find the percentages of judges in specified age ranges, then multiply by the total number of judges.  For example, if 20% of Judges are under the age of 21, we can multiply 20 by 80 to find the number of Judges who are between the ages of 21 and 40 (i.e. judges between 0 and 40 years old minus 21 years is 18 years).  To determine the number of judges over 51 years, we use the same logic but find 51 minus 21 years which is 30 years. Then we multiply 30 by the percent of judges over 30 years.  The percentage over 30 is 60%, so we find 30*60/100 which is 18. \nThus, 30% of judges over the age of 55 are over 50 because we are dividing the total Judges, which includes those under and over the age of 30.\n5. Similarly, we would determine the number of judged over 53 by dividing a total of 40 by the percentage of 53 which is 45 (53 - (30 + 21)). 45/40 which is ~1.1 (1", "answer": " 12"}

This means Joe caught the ball three times, Derek caught it three times and Tammy caught it three times.\n2)The second step is to determine which people caught the ball the most times. To do this, we will subtract Joe and Derek's catch number from four times as seen in the question. The answer is -4.\n3)So Joe caught the most times, then Tammy.\n4) The third step is to divide all the catch numbers by three to remove the constant of three (so each person catches the ball once) and add two extra times Tammy caught the ball. This is because Tammy had sixteen more catches than Joe and Joe caught the ball three more times than Derek, so Tammy will catch it sixteen more than that amount, which is a total of 8 times more than Joe or Derek.

Let's say she started with 10kg of dog food and she purchased another 10kg. This makes a total of 20kg. So Elise started with 20kg and she bought an additional 20kg.\n2nd:So how many kilograms of food did Elise already own when she bought the additional 20kg? Let's say she had a total of 25kg. Then, she bought additional 20kg of dog food, making a total of 45kg.\n3rd:In total, Elise now had 14kg more than she had originally. So Elise had 14kgs more than she had originally, and she now had 45kgs of dog food.\n4th:Now we can determine how much more or less she has. When we subtract what she had before, from what she currently has, we get 14 more than what she had originally. In the original scenario, she had (20kgs - 10kg) of dog food since she bought an additional 10 kgs.

{"text": "1) The first step is to gather the relevant information. It's important to make sure you understand what the question is asking, as well as any additional information that might be necessary.\n2) We are given three pieces of information: 5; 30; 20. These can be re-written as: 5_l_/_km; 30_l_/_trip; and 20_l_/trip.\n3) To answer the question, we need to create three new variables (trips, liters, and km/trip) and plug in each of our given pieces of information. This will allow us to work with a set of quantifiable values rather than having to perform simple calculations.\n4) We start off by defining the variable \"trips\". Since we're going to travel trips of 37 and 20 km, we can define trip = 50. Next, we define \"trip\" = km/trip. This allows us to easily calculate our distance.\n5) From here, we can define the variable \"liters\". Since we have a total of 5 liters of gas, divided by our average 12 kilometer per liter, we have liters = 1.25 liters.\n6) When we are given units in the form of _l_/_km_, we can re-write the distance in the format of km. Therefore, our final distance is 50 * 1.25 = 62.5 km.\n7) To perform our calculation: Using our set variables, we can write our equation as follows:\n    L = 50*1.25 = liters = 62. 5\n    Since we are traveling 2 trips, our total L + L = liters = 125 liters. \n    This means that John should plan to use 1.25Liters for each km of travel.\n\nSo the final answer will be 125 Liters\n\nInput: What type of animal is on the picture when the 4 different types of animals are combined together?

One list contains different brakes that can fail. The other list contains the different situations when brakes can fail.\n\nNow we compare these two lists. There are a lot of different options that could fail the brakes, like broken or worn down brakes. However, brakes can also fail if there is something in the way, like a puddle of oil on the street. So, this scenario is more like to the second list, when brakes can fail for different reasons.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct here.\n\nSo the final answer\nis C: 2/3 is the probability that the brakes are not moving at this time.", "answer": " 18"}

The question is asking, \u201cif Zig wrote 6 books less than Flo, how many books did Zig and Flo write altogether?\u201d This will lead us to determine that the total amount of books written is 66. The reasoning for this comes from the fact that 60 is 6 books less than 66.

{"text": "1) The first few steps in solving this question are to work out the relationship between how long fish and dogs live. \n2) This can be done by plugging in the provided values into the formula. Let's call the average of how long dogs and hamsters live \"X\". \nHence, X = 4 * Y.  So, Y = 2 / X \n3) Now, we know that fish live 2 years more than hamsters (if they are well-cared for). To determine how long this translates to us, we need to compare X to 2. Plugging in the values and rearranging yields: X > 2. Therefore, X > 2 or Y > 1.\n4) Since X is greater than 2, we can conclude that Y, the average length of time that a dog (D) or hamster (H) live, must be less than 1. This means that we can't have H = D - so H > 1.\n5) To determine how long a fish can live, we need to combine all the facts and values given in the question. We know a fish lives 2 years longer than a hamster, thus X > 2 years = D + H or X - D > D + H. \n6) Since we know that D and H are both less than 1, the expression given above must be positive. This yields X > D + H or X > (D + H + 4).\n7) In other words, the combined length of a fish's life + 2 years is longer than the combined length of a dog's + hamster's life + 4 years. So, fish can live longer than dogs and hamsters combined by 4 years. Hence, the answer is Y: 4\nSo the final answer are Y: 4\n\nInput: What time in the morning is your father?

{"text": "12. The first line provides the information that Harris feeds his dog 5 large organic carrots over the course of 8 days.  The second line provides the fact that there are 5 carrotes in a pound bag and each pound costs $2.03.\n2. Now, we have to apply some mathematical concepts to the scenario. Remember that we're talking about a dog and a human and that we don't want to include bacteria and worms in our equation.\n3. To solve for how much Harris spent on carrots over the year, we need to understand what these organic carrots look like. Let's say that the 5 carrots are cut up into 8 bite- sized pieces (which seems likely because the solution mentions that the carrots are large). Also, we would have to assume that these carrots are washed and not dirty because we want to take care of our pets. \n4. So, in one year Harris's dog got 40 bite- sized carrots. (5 carrots/8 carrot pieces means that each piece has half a carrot. Assuming 2 bite size carrots per day, that means that there are 20 pieces of carrots per day. That means that over 1 year there are a total of 200 carrots eaten).\n5. Next, we apply the information mentioned in the second line. There are 5 carrot pieces in a pound plus $5.00. To make the equation simple, we need to convert all of the carrots to pounds and all of the dollar values to cents and then add them back together.\n6. We will also assume that for the simplicity of this question that one pound carrot piece costs $1.03.\n7. Now, we can do the math. 5 carrot plus $2.00 equals $7.00 plus 200 carrot pieces plus $2.03 equals 7.00 plus (200 * $1.03) equals $1772.\n8.  Finally, take away the numbers we added, and we can see the final answer, which is $12. This would mean that Harris spent $12 on carrots over a year", "answer": " 146"}
{"text": "1. The first step in solving this puzzle is to identify the key information. We are given four pieces of information:\n\nA:  John needs to take 2 pill a day.\n\nB:  One pill is $1.50.\n\nC:  The insurance covers (40%) of the cost.\n\nD:  The number of days, or 30.\n\n2. The key information consists of the total cost, and the amount the insurance covers. We already know that we have two pills a day, so the total pills taken in a month is \"2 * 30\" or 60. The total cost of these pills is, \"B * C\". However, the insurance only covers $0.40 of each pill, and thus increases the cost of each pill to $1.90. Thus, the total cost is (B * C) * (1.9).\n3. We now have enough information to find the total cost, and use that to calculate the amount of insurance payment.\n```\n4. The pills are $0.90 each\n5. The insurance covers $0.45 each\n6.

{"text": "1. The question asks for the hourly rate of a worker with a base salary of $576 per month. It is important to note that the salary is considered to be paid in full, not subject to any deductions for taxes or other expenses, such as a 401k plan or insurance premiums.\n2. The solution to this problem is to divide the monthly salary of $5,760 by the number of days worked in a year (365). The quotient, which is equivalent to an hourly rate of $1.56. \n3. We can then multiply this rate by the number of hours worked per day (8 hours) to get the hourly rate ($13.3) per day. \n4. And finally, multiply this by the number of days in a week (6) to achieve an hourly salary of $80.72 per week. \nBut, to get the most accurate answer, it is also important to take into consideration a deduction of $10 per hour. \nThis would mean the total hourly rate of Edric's salary would be $20.72 per hour. And, if he worked 8 hours for those 6 days, he would earn $163.68 per day, or $1636.80 per week. \nSo, in case of a monthly salary of, let's say $1500, it would be divided by the number of days (30), which gives you an hourly rate of an average $50 an hour.\nSo that's $3.55 times 8 hours a day, or $29.40 an hour. Over a week, it would give him an average of $216.00, which is $2,194 for a month.\nSo, the final answer is $2,174.\n\nInput: What do you do?

We can use the assumption that each fence is 8 feet tall (to make the math simpler) to determine the height of each fence in the line of fences. \n \nSince the pony is in the fence at the 39th spot, that means the fences have an additional 9 spots or 18 feet in between each fence, totaling 8 feet added to the height of each fences.\n \nHence the height of the fences is 26 feet, and the pony can thus only jump over the first fence since it is already over 27 feet.\n \nSince dogs are not included, we can deduce that only cats or snakes would be able to jump over the fences. However, only snakes could exceed the height of the fence, with 6 additional feet at the 37th fence. This means that no other animals could jump over the fence.\n \nTherefore, option E: snake\n\nInput: If the length of a rectangle is 3 more than twice the width of the rectangle, and the area is 144 square inches. what is the length and width of the rectangle?\n \nOutput:  We can use the formula to find the area of our rectangle, which will allow us to equate the length and width of our rectangle.

Susan is making 30 batches which comes to a total of 60 servings. \n5. So how much potatoes are needed?\n6. A potato costs $$.10 and a container costs $2. Because we want 1 teaspoons of salt for each potato, we need to multiply 2 by 4 for each potato. $1 x 2 = $2.00 and 4 x $2 =$8.00 therefore we need 8 pots of potatoes for 60 servings of food in addition to a container of salt.\n7. We need to determine the amount of containers of salt.\n8. Susan is making 60 servings so the recipe calls for a total of 120 containers of salt. However, since each batch calls for 1/2 teaspoon of sodium chloride and each container contains 5 teaspoon of chloride we will need to increase the number of containers of salt by 50.\n9.

Since total gms. puppo = 3 * 3 * (3) = 27, multiply (total grams food for puppies) by 27 \n4: Substitute the total pounds of food by the dogs (total dog food) = 48 and the total pounds of food to the pups (total puppy food) = 27\n5: Thus, the total grams of food eaten (total gram food eaten by dogs + total grams eaten by puppies) = 48 + 27 = 75\n\nHere is the logic behind the solution:\n1. If a dog eating 4 pounds of food per day, and eats three times more often than a puppy, divide and conquer.\n2. Eat 4 pounds per day with 3 times more often than a dog (3 X 4), but at 3 times the pace of a dog (one third the dog's food-per-time-consumed). It's 3 X 3, or 9 as a rule of thumb in this case.\n3. (Puppies eat for 3 gms. = 2 gms. 3X more than a dog - 1 gm/day) for a total of 2 gms. * 9, which we convert to 18 gms.  to get an expected total of 2 * 18 = 36 gms.\n4.

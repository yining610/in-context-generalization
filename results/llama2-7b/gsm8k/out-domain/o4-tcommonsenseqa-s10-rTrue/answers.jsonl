{"text": "We can solve this problem using 3 approaches.\n\n1. Using the mathematical expression, which can be solved quickly by plugging in the values for Tina's rate, the number of hours she works per shift and the number of shits she is working.\n\n2. Use 1/2(10).4 to find the amount that 1/2(  the number of hours worked ) of her regular rate.  then add the rate on 10.4 for 10 hours per day in 5 days.\n\n3. Use the rule: A number can't be negative twice, which means if one number is negative, the other must be positive. Use $18, $18.4 for one hour, $18.60 for the ten hour shift for 4 more hours and the correct answer is 2,508.80.\n\n### Rationales:\nOption 1: Using the mathematical expression (18 + (18)/2) (5*(10)) or (18 + (9) (5*(1/2)) (5*(10)). This is a really simple method and requires the values of: the total 35 hours (5*(10)), 5, 4, and your answer of $2,508,80.\n\nOption 2: By using the fact that 1/2 is multipal, and you can add the numbers that are made from multiplying 1/2 of the variable, in this case the overtime you work. Add the amount you earned for your regular rate, then the overtime you earned the rate of. This will give a positive result.\n\nOption 3: Using common rules, all answers have to have the same sign. if one number is negative the other must be positive, but not vice versa. This means we can use any answer other than negative since, negative multiplies into more negative.\nUsing this rule only works if the variable is not positive. In this case we can subtract 18+ overtime rate to find an answer. We can do this 4 times, and get $2,509+8.33=2,517+8.33,\nThis gives us the following order:\n$2,508+$8.25+$8.25=$2,5", "answer": " 990"}

So, by this option it is not true that there are many people that work. So, A: 60% cannot be the correct answer.\nOption B: If all of these people are willing to use bikes, the only people that cannot use bikes are people that don't live in this city, which means that the city is the biggest city in the world.

We know this because 24 is the quantity at the top section and there is no way to do this.\n\nNow, eliminate the rest: 46 can't be the amount of books on the top section as only 24 books can be allowed at the top section.\n\nSo 24 is the only quantity that is not eliminated as it is correct.\n\nFor example, one can do it mentally like this:\n\n 46 books  12 history books  8 romance books  4 poetry books \n\n12 + 8\n\n 20       12 history books  12 romance books   0 poetry books\n\n12 + remaining  8\n\n20 + 8\n\n28", "answer": " 46"}
{"text": "To solve this problem, we should first determine the number of tubes of lip glos per person so that we can properly calculate the total amount of lip gloss necessary. Based on the given information, each tube can offer makeup for 3 people since 2 tubes will be consumed in making up 3 people. Therefore, each person will be provided with 4 tubes of lip gloth at most.\n\nWe should then use multiplication to calculate the total number of people Marcy needs to cover by dividing 6 tubes by these 4 tubes per person, which gives us 1.5 individuals per tube. Multiplying 1.5 by 6 gives us a total of 9 individuals that Marcy will need to make up in all.\n\nTherefore, the solution is that the number of individuals being painted by lip gloss is 9, which we derived by multiplying 6 tubes by 1.5 individuals.\n\n### Input A: Marcy is a makeup Artist and has agreed to do makeup for her friend\u2019s wedding. The makeup she needs to do is the most important part since it requires skill level, therefore they will start by painting all the women attending the wedding in the makeup before focusing on the groom. The makeup artist needs 4 tubes of makeup for each woman and she has agreed to use a 10-tube tube of makeup for each man.\n\n### Rational The first step is to determine the number of people Marcy will makeup. She will paint the women first, followed the men. Marcy started with a total of 9 people, who are 8 women and 1 man; Marcy used 10 tubes of makeup and 9 tubes of makeup. The 10th tube of makeup, used for the man, was divided among the 8 women and 4 men. So the number of makeup tubes she used for each of the 9 people that came out to 11. Therefore, the number of people who will receive the entire 10 tubes was 1.\n\n### Output A:\n```\nThe number of people she used 10 tubs of makeup.\n```", "answer": " 36"}

D: Are pits deeper than shafts? E: Are shafts closer to the Earth's surface? \n\n#### Rationales:\n1. In order to answer \"A\" the student needs to determine whether pits, which are an open vertical passageway from the ground surface to a lower level, like a mine, are more dangerous than shaft, which are defined as \"a vertical opening, drilled from the surface to a lower level of the mine\" \n2. To answer \"B\" the student needs to compare pits with shafts and determine whether weather conditions will affect both or just one of them.\n3. For \"C\" weather conditions are not factored in to shafts because they are underground. Since the student knows that pits need to access the ground surface, they must be aware that weather could affect their safety.\n4. When determining weather conditions will affect shafts we must remember that pits are vertical. Underground structures such as shafts, are always under constant threat of natural disasters such as earthquakes and flooding. \n5. \"D\", pits, are defined as descending into the Earth from the surface, the question is asking if pits are deeper than traditional shafts, which are dug into the ground from the surface.\n6. A surface shaft can be deep, but if it's already a surface shaft, it's usually a lot closer to the ground's surface than a pit. We're also given no specific depth for these shafts at any point, so \"E\" is the correct answer.\n7.

We then divide the total number of animals (in this case 56) by 2 (the difference between cows and pigs), which gives us 28 pigs and cows. If we then divide the number of pigs and cows by 4 (the difference between goats and cows), we end up with 5 pigs and 9 cows. We know that the number of pigs is twice as much as the number of cows (24 pigs and 12 cows), and the number of cows is 9 fewer than the number of goats (18 goats).\n\nThis means that we can use the information provided to determine the total number of cows, which is 19 (24+12-9), and by dividing this number by the remaining group, goats (the difference between cogs and pigs), which is 8 (19/2), we end up with the answer 17.

The large tubs had a total cubed volume of 800 cubic inches (64 x 12.5 x 12.7 in.). If she paid $6 for each large tub, she spent $48 total (64 x $6).\n\n### Demostration, A, who got it right the first try:\nThe question states that the large tubes cost $6 each. Given a 64 liter (20 gal, 18L, 0.7 barrel) tub, then a large tub costs $6.\nThe other tub size was stated as 64 *.0353 US (3.53). The US gallon is 3.78, which means that a 64 liter US gallon is 64 * 3.8 = 231.9. A liter is smaller than a gallon, so it stands to reason that a 64L = 210 US gallons.\nThe question then asks how many small tubs does 64 liters fit in.\nTo find this out, I multiplied 210 by.6, to get the number of smaller tubs. A little math tells me that 128 *.6 = 76, so there were 76 smaller tubs.\nThe cost of 76 smaller tubes is $48, which brings the price to $6.7 per tub.\nThe larger tub holds 20 more gallons than the smaller tub, so a larger tub will hold more gallons at a similar price.\n\n### Response, B, who does not have the correct answer:\nStep 1: 125 small tubs fit into 10 gallons -125 * 0.118 to calculate what it costs per tub; $1.18\nStep Alison bought some storage for her garage.

Meaning that the second CD we buy is 90 minutes long.\n\nSo, the combined length of the first and second CDs is: 90 + 90, which equals 180.\n\nThe third CD that was purchased is twice as long as the second CD because of the question, which means it is 120 x 2 = 240 minutes.\n\nSo, in total, the combined length of all three CDs is 180 minutes plus 240 minutes, which equals 420 minutes, or 1 hour and 25 minutes.\n\n### Source:\nSolution by [Erica Hunt](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3366364/erica-hunt)", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "On Tuesday Matt worked half the number of hours he worked on Monday, which gives us 225 minutes.  On Wednesdays he worked for 380 minutes, which means Wednesday he worked (380-225) 155 more minutes.\n\n### Rationale\nDemonstration: \nFirst let's define each of the terms from the question to establish a more accurate understanding of it. \n\nThe question refers to the numbers of hours worked by Matt on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays. What this means is that we are talking about minutes and not hours. \nSince the options don't mention anything about what type of measurements the question refers to, we are left to understand that the question refers to minutes. The same logic used with the previous problem would give us 225 (225 minutes) as the number of minutes worked on Tuesday. \n\nFrom the question we are provided with the number of minutes worked and the number of minutes worked during the following days: \n1. Monday: worked for 455 minutes.\n2. Tuesday: worked half of the number of minutes worked the previous day, which results in 225 minutes\n3.

Let's solve for red.\nRed balls = 2 x (Twice as many red as blue ball)\n2x(twice as many red as the blue ball) = number of red balls\n4x = number of red balls \nso the formula is 4 = number of red balls. \n\nNow we can solve for the number of blue balls:\n\n2 x (twice as many red balls as the blue balls) = number of blue balls\n\n2x(2x + 1) = number of blue ball.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4x = number balls.\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we have:\n\n1= x\n\nTherefore, the total number of blue balls is 4.\n\nTo find out the total green balls we can do likewise by first solving for '5 green balls' and applying the inverse operation.\n\nTo solve for green: the inverse operation is dividing by 2.\n\nWe know that there are 11 green balls, which means that in each 2 balls, 1 is green which means that we can multiply each 2 balls by 4.\nWe have: 5 = 2x4\n\nTherefore, 5 green balls is equal to 8 green balls.\n\nFinally we multiply both sides by 2 and have:\n\n10= (2x4)\n\nTherefore, there are 10 green balls.\n\nNow we have to go the other way and solve for the number of green balls we don't know.

{"text": "Input: Mrs. Wilsbourgh saved $500 for concert tickets. She ended up buying $500 worth of tickets. How much does she have in her savings?\nRationales:\nTo solve this problem, we can first identify the number of regular tickets and VIP tickets Mrs. Wilsbourugh bought. The question states that she bought 2 VIP ticket at $100 a ticket and 3 regular tickts at $50 each, so we can write the amount as $200 + (3 * $50) = $300. We then need to subtract the amount of tickets she bought from her original saving to see how much savings she has left. The original saving of $500 was to buy concert tickets, so we can subtract this amount and the number of tickets she eventually bought to see how much of the original saving she has left. Putting these values together and simplifying the formula gives us $500 - ($200 + (2 * $100)) - $50 = $210. The value of Mrs. Wilsbourough's savings after she buying tickets would be $210.\n\n### Input\n- What is the sum of the first three prime factors of 195?\n- What is the prime factorization of 202 as a product of consecutive integers excluding 1?", "answer": " 150"}

{"text": "Step-by-step guide that solves the question\n\n### Demostration:\n\nInput, we're told Andy harvests all the 18 plants that harvests tomatoes. So here 18 plants have 7 tomatoes of each. So total I'm going to put my answer here just to remind myself. This is what I'm gonna use as my total. So 18 times 7, this is what I'm looking for. So then Andy harvests those plants and he takes those 18 plants. He harvested them. So now he has. This is a total 126 tomatoes. Now he cuts that in half. so half of that would be 63 tomatoes and then a third of the remaining is 22 tomatoes. So if we just take the first half or the whole, we'll know that this divided by 18 is actually giving us a whole tomato. So 63 divided by 18. So 63 18. So this gives me 3.5, right? So let me just put my answer here. This is 63 divided by two is half. So this 68, 18 is 4 tomatoes for each plant. So my answer here is 48 plus, right? So that's where I got that number? Yeah, so we got one by doing our math. And now he'll also harvest those 22 tomatoes and then he'll also dry half the tomatoes, so he's gonna put them into his marinara sauce. Okay, which will come to 11 marinara sauce and then he'll have 22 tomatoes remaining. So after he has done that he's now left with 11 tomatoes. So here's my answer. This is my first question. This is my answer in a form of a sentence. The answer is that Andy harvest all the tomatoes from then 18 plants that which has 126 tomato. Andy dries her plant for half of them. Andy turns a third of them into marinara sauces.

It is important to note that while the question specifies that \"cakes\" are being made, this does not restrict our possible choices to only those that would be used in a cake recipe.\n4. The best method in this scenario is to use elimination.\n\n5. Starting from the beginning, if the choice A: flour is chosen, the outcome would be that the cakes would be full of flour - which isn't really a desirable outcome. Thus, we can discard this option.\n6. Next, let's consider option B: eggs; if we choose this option, then the cakes would largely be made out of eggs, which seems equally unlikely as the flour cakes.

{"text": "Let's first calculate the distances. Since the cheetah can run 60 mph, we can assume that he travels 60 miles in 1 minute. We can also assume that the same applies to the gazelle, who travels at 40 mph. So in 1 minute, the cheetah would have traveled 40 miles and the gazelle 24 miles. Given that the distance between them after 1 minute would be 210 feet, we know that they traveled in the direction of 0-180.\n\nNow, since the gazelle is travelling at 40 m/s and the cheetah is travelling at 60m/s and they are both travelling in the same direction, the relationship between their speeds is as follows:\n```\n60 / 40 = 40/60 = x/x = 1/x\n```\n\nAnd solving for x, we get x= 1.5. This means that the cheetah has to make 1.5 miles in 1 minute to keep pace with the gazelle, therefore \n```\n(1.5 ft/s)/1 min = 1.5 ft/1 s\n```\n\nThe cheetah has to do this in order to keep pace with the already running gazelle and in order to catch up after 1 minute, the running gazelle would have to travel a total of 360 feet since 60/1.5 = 40, which means that the running gazelle traveled 4 laps. Now, in the formula for speed d = sqrt(d)/t, if the gazelle travels 60 feet per second, then d = sqrt(60 fps) = sqrt of 60 = 210 feet. So d = 210 fts, t = 1 minute, we get:\n```\n210 = d x t / t\n```\n\nNow we can plug these values (210, 1, 60*1) into the equation:\n```\n27 = 210/60 (square root)\n```\n\nPlugging in the variable d (210) for t and t for d (1), we get t/d =", "answer": " 7"}

How many minutes did the customer wait in line?\n\n### Input Solution:\nThe customer waited for 2 hours and 50 minutes. This is because there are 10 hours for the store to be open and because the customer entered the store at 7:45am, the customer waited 1 hour for every 10 hours of operation, so the total amount of time the customer waited was 2 hours 50 minutes\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question refers to \"the customer walked in at 7:30 am.\" Since it is specific that the customer walked in at that time, it implies that the customer arrives before the doors of the grocery store open, which is where their 1 hour begins.\n\nThe time of arrival is 7:40AM, so this means that the entire opening period of operation is over by the time the customer arrives. This leaves us with the store having 10 hours or 0.144 hours in one minute.\n\nTherefore, we may calculate how much time the customer took to wait using the calculation that 1 hour is equivalent to one minute.\n\nHence the answer: 2 hours and 25 minutes.\n\n### Input Answer:\nThe answer is 2 hours and 30 minutes. This is the solution because the customer walks in at ten minutes before the store opens, so they waited one hour for every ten", "answer": " 3600"}

The next task is to figure out how much money Mr. Caiden owes the supplier in order to receive the amount of metal roofing that he has paid for and the amount of metal roof that was sent by the supplier as a free gift.\n\nThe easiest way to solve this question is to divide the number of feet of metal roofing Mr. Caiden bought with what was shipped by subtracting the two. For example, if he purchased 300 feet with 250 foot being given, you can solve this mathematically as follows:\n\n300 feet of roofing*8 dollars = 2400 dollars\n\n- 250 feet = 2000 dollars remaining\n\nTherefore, Mr. Caiden needs to pay $400 dollars to the 300+2000=2300 roofing feet he purchased \n\n### Input\nWhat would need oil to be produced?

{"text": "John jogged for 2 hours, at the average speed of 5 miles per hour. The total distance that John jogged is 100 miles.\n\n### Explanation: The statement in the first paragraph says that when John runs alone, he runs at the speed of 4 miles an hour, and when he runs with the 100- pound German Shepherd, he runs with the speed of 6 miles an hour. Given the information, it can be inferred that John's speed varies with the type of run: the speed while he is alone would be 5 - 4= 1 mph faster than that while he jogs with his dog and the speed while he is being dragged.\nGiven the above information, the next statement, in which John runs for a total of 60 minutes would be:\n(4 + 6)60= (10+10) 60= 160\nAnd the total distance John would run by himself, taking that information into account is:\n560-(160*2)=400\nNow adding the times:\n(4 +6)60+(-160, 30) = 400+(160, 0)= 340+[160, 160]\nThe total distance John jogged was [4*400 + 4*4*60+ 4*4*20] = 6400\n\n### Demotivation:Answer the following math question.\n\nInput: An object is dropped from an airplane.

{"text": "Due to the fact that the poles in question here are relatively tall, more than 50 feet, the most likely choice is A, 2 feet. Based on the problem question, at the 7th minute, the telephone pole Jason was climbing will be 3/8, or 39 inches higher than Matt's tree, which translates to about 2 feet. This choice should be correct.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe key information is that Jason climbs 12 feet/minute and that Matt climbs 6 feet/min, we know from the question that Jason gets significantly higher after 7 minutes, but we don't know how high he gets. We can't answer this with numbers directly, however we can use the heights of people and objects in our lives to make our decision. The tallest I can think of is a telephone pole, which is 50 feet at most in Canada. The highest I can think of is around 65 foot skyscrapers that can be found across the US. Since we know that the difference of how high each person can climb is less of a difference to 65 times the difference, which is less than an inch per foot, I think 2 foot is more than enough for Jason to get ahead of his friend, and as such, this should be the appropriate response.", "answer": " 42"}
{"text": "Six-sevenths of them were recyclable.\n\n### Details:\nThis question has an extra piece of information given to us: One-half of the people drank soda, in which case we can eliminate options B, C, and D.\n\nWe now can use that same extra piece of information to help narrow the possible number of glass bottles people drank to 25.\n\nThen, if we subtract the total number of plastic bottles or the total number of juice bottles from the total number of recyclable glass bottles, we can deduct the total number of them. One can is a recyclable one-sixth of all recyclable bottles. The number of cans is equal to 6/7.\n\nThe extra answer choice D makes a great deal of mathematical sense. However, it is not an appropriate answer choice because it violates the constraint provided to us in the question:\n\nOne half of the guests drink soda, 1/3 drink sparkling water, and Four-fifths of juice is consumed.\n\nGiven that juices are consumed Four-fifths means that there would be approximately 4/5 juice bottles consumed. However, if there were 50 juice bottles, this would leave us with ONLY 4/5 juices consumed, not 45/5 juice bottle.\n\nIn this case, we know that 2/3 of the guests drank one type of drink, then we are given the information about the other type of drinks. This leaves us with two possibilities: some or all of the remaining people drank plastic water.

{"text": "In order to answer the question, we will need to determine the total amount of time Tim spends biking in a week. We would then use this information to calculate how much time he spends on each of his bike rides.\n\nTo begin, we would need to find the total amount of miles Travelled in a week. Tim rides his bike to work back and forth for 5 workdays, totaling 100 trips. For simplicity, let us assume that each trip takes exactly the same amount of time, and that there is no idle waiting at each work location, nor no time for other leisure activities. Therefore, Tim spends (100/2)*5 = 50 hours biking to work.\n\nNow let us calculate the weekend bike ride. He cycles 200 miles for this trip. This translates to 10 miles per hour. Assuming this same constant rate of 10 miles per hours for the whole ride, this can be broken down into 6 segments of 20 miles each.\nIn one segment, we can conclude that Tim can travel: (200/6)*5 = 10 miles. So all told, for each of these 6 segments, Tim travels 10 miles at a rate of 20 miles per hour. In other words: (10mi/20mi)*6 = 3 segments of 3 miles per trip.\n\nAll combined, it means that Tim will travel a total of (50+3 times 3) = 82.5 miles per week. We get the total amount of time Travelled per week:\n(82.5 mi/25mi)*5 = 21.5 hours.\nTherefore, the total amount of time spent biking a week is 21.5hrs.", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "If Anna gets 14 pieces, while Billy gets 11 pieces per house, that means Anna's division has more houses, hence she can answer this question. Since she can answer this question, answer it! We must assume that the subdivisions are fairly similar in other ways. It doesn't make sense if one house gives out more than the other. She can now subtract Billy's total number of candy from hers to know her total.\n\nHer subdivision holds more houses than Billy's total houses. It holds 60 houses. If he gets 11 each, he holds 75 houses. This would require him to add 11 to the total number of houses to hold 60. So this means Anna holds 76 houses if she gets 14 for every house, while Billy holds 86 if he gets 11 for every house.\n\nNow, Anna holds 76 - 11= 65 houses. Billy holds 86 - 11 = 75 houses. So, Anna has 14 candy for each house and Billy has 76 pieces of candy for each house.

We have to pick two colors, the green ones and the one that matches it\nThere are three pairs of shoes with 3 colors for the the green one, (blue, red and orange)\nthe ones that match the green one can be blue, red or orange, so there are three of them, and hence we will remove the choices of the ones that doesn't match the green ones. \nIn the first part we choose the green one, from the ones that fit we select blue, since they will always pair up, therefore we will get 1 combination. we do the same process for red and orange ( 2 more combinations).\nNext we will choose the shoes that matches to the green ones and we get two more combinations, after that we will get our answers, the green shoes-green socks will always pair up so we will get 3 combinations, hence we will get 8 combinations in total.\n## Answer:\nThree solutions,", "answer": " 258"}
{"text": "The number of cars traveling on Happy Street from Monday through Friday is 190.

For example, to calculate 2.5x30, the \ud835\udf16 is used to replace \"4,\" giving us 75.\n\nTo solve this problem, we first find the total number of cars traveling down Happy Street on Tuesday by subtracting the number of cars traveling during Monday by 25.\n\nThen, we find the total number traveling on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of cars on Tuesday by 20%:\n\n```\n(25 \u2212 25 \u00d7 0.80)\n= 0\n```\n\nNext, we find the total cars on Thursday by subtracting it from the total number of cars that were traveling on Wednesdays:\n\n```\n[Total cars on Wednesday \u2212 (25 \u2212 20)% of the Total number of cars traveling with on Tuesday]\n= 25 + 1.20 \u00d7 25\n= 30\n```\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of cars travel on Thursday from the number of cars travel in Friday:\n\n```\nNumber of cars with on Friday \u2212 Number of cars that was traveling on Thursday\n= 30 - 25\n= [1.25 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 2 = 48]\n```\n\nTo find the total number of car travel during the weekend, simply use the same formula on Sunday:\n\n```\n= (1.25 \u00d7 [50 \u2212 30] \u00d7 2 = 350)\n```\n\nFinishing, we multiply the total of \ud835\udf16 by 25:\n\n```\n[(48 + 50 + 350) \u00d7 25 ]\n= [264.8 + 56.5 + 625] \u00d7 (25)\n= [890.9 +", "answer": " 97"}

{"text": "The logic behind this question goes something like this, from the statement that Max always gets the gits he asked for, we can guess that there must be something wrong with the statement asking for gifts twice every year for 5 of his birthdays.\n\n### If you had to make this assessment without any prior knowledge of how children are typically gifted and with the exception of Max's specific case, you might make a guess that the statement for 5 of his other birthdays means that Max will receive 5 birthday trains, and double them for a total of 10 trains.\n\nHowever, this is not the case and we can see that Max's mom and dad double his collection after he gave 25 trains instead of 26 (noting that he was supposed to receive 2 gifts per every birthday for 5 years).\n\nGiven, in any single year, Max requested 2 birthday trains, and the total gifts given to Max were 26 trains, this means that there exists an error in the given information. With that said, it is clear that Max received a birthday train every 5 years and that he additionally received 2 gifts from his mom and dad for a total of 26 gifts in this case.\n\nSince Max received trains, he did not receive any other gifts as given in the statement, and thus, Max's mom and his dad give him exactly what it is he ask for, hence, his mom and dad double the number of birthday trains Max received because he wanted more trains for the remainder of his birthdays after he asked for every other birthday.\n\nThis way, if you calculate the number of trains that Max received for the 5 birthdays, noting that it is not necessarily the same as the number of gifts he received, you would find that Max asked for trains for gifts 1-5, which would be the birthdays 1-5 as given in the question. Therefore, you could simply multiply whatever number Max obtained from trains/gifts for the remainder of 5 years (25), and noting that the original statement of Max asking for gifts 2 times a year for his 5th birthday gives a total of 15, that means that all of the birthday trains are from gifts that Max received for each of the 5 birthdays from his mom and d", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "We can calculate how much he would spend in a week by applying the equation $3 peanuts x 7 days or $21, because it is a whole number.\n\nNow, if we want to calculate how many pound he will eat per day, we must first solve for how many peanuts he is eating on a certain day, and then multiply that by seven, which give us the answer that he is eating 9 peanuts a day.\n\nHowever, if we apply this solution for every day in a week, we would have to add all the days together, which would be 9 + 9 + 9 = 27. But that's too high for him to eat at the end of the week!\n\nHowever, if a person wants to eat the whole pound at the end of the day by not eating any more peanuts during the week, how many peanuts per day? By analyzing the equation $3 peans x 7 days, we see that the value of $21 does not change when we multiply by seven. This is a proof that the result holds true for any value applied to the equation. This means that he can have $21 each day.\n\nSince the answer lies at $3 peanuts a day, it means he'll eat $21 a week.\n\nHe will buy the peanuts for $3 per pound a week, and this will give him seven pounds every week.\n\nHence, we have 7 pounds each week, which will make 9 pounds in a day, and 7 days in a week. This gives us 9 pounds in a week.\n\nSo, he will eat 9 pounds a week.\n\nAnswer: 9 pounds\n\n### Instructions:\nImagine you buy a house: you can do so by paying for the entire cost of the house, as well as other extra fees.

We need to be careful with a mistake that comes here easily: we can\u2019t assume the bakery will make that amount of money and it would only have the $40, without the cost of creating the pies. \n\nThe key here is to understand that the $ 0.5 per pie represents the costs of creation. To do this we also need to understand the context of the question and see the amount of profit the bakery makes by making more than 12 pies during its operating hours. The answer to this question is given as $47.5, which is the same way I understand the question! \n\nWe use the formula for finding the profit: Profit = Sale amount \u2013 Costs \n\nThis can be translated into: Profit = $4 (value of a Pie Piece) \u2013 $0.5 (Value of creating a Pie Piece) Which gives us a profit of $4.\n\nSince this amount is being paid for the bakery in addition to the value of the Pieces, $4.50 per piece (that's $4.5 for a Piece Piece and Sale price of $4.0), the amount of overall money the bakery makes is $42 + (3*4.5) = $47.5", "answer": " 138"}

The other four options aren't years or times. These are degrees. So if someone is pursuing their education, it means they are getting their degree and then get their diploma which can be used when applying to jobs. The process is completed when they get their degrees. If you have a bachelor's degree, you don't have to get any other degrees. You can get other jobs that require degrees or higher education, depending on the job. So, Tony doesn't have to get two graduate degrees with a physics degree because he has a bachelor't degree in science for four years.  The number of degrees he has obtained does not tell us how long it took him to complete that degree. \n\nThe math would be: 4 years for his bachelor's + 2 years for his master's (which requires a bachelor'so degree) = 6 years. \n\nThe degrees that Tony pursued may or may not have been related to his major:\n\n1.

There are 32 books Megan has read overall.\n2. Kelcie has read 35/4 books overall.\n3. Greg has read 9 books more than twice as many as Kelcie.\n4. Therefore, Kelcie has read 9/8 more than twice as many books as Greg.\n5. We can add this information together and conclude that Megan has read 9/7 times as many books as Greg and 9/6 times as many books as Kelcie.\n6. Taking these steps and combining them with the information already known that Megan has read a total of 32 books, we conclude that overall, 292 books have been read by the three characters combined.\n7. To answer the question fully, it is therefore necessary to add the numbers again, and we can conclude that all three has read 55 books together this year.\nAnswer: A total of 55 books have been read altogether by Megan, Kelcie & Greg this year.\n\n### Input\n> The word that means having no color is called what?

{"text": "John has 16 and a half remaining bulbs (half the 16, plus 16).\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The given information states that John has a box with 40 lightbulbs, purchases 16 of them, and keeps half of the remaining lightbulbs.\n2. We begin by setting up the base scenario: 40 bulbs \u00d7 1/2 = 20.5 bulbs. The other 16 bulbs are the ones that John purchased.\n3. We then eliminate the \"half\" option since it appears in the input and would suggest that half of the purchased bulbs were given to a friend.\n4. Since we cannot have 20.5 + 16 bulbs, we can add half of what's left to the total amount purchased, which can be deduced using the formula: 20.5 \u00d7 2 = 41 (half \u00d7 2 = 1.05, then 1.05 \u00d7 2 = two whole bulbs).\n5. John has 41 bulbs left. \n\nAnswer: 41\n\n### Input\"Jimmy went to store and bought cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms and onions.  What all did he purchase?  Choice: CheeseTomatoes\nMushroomsOnions\n\n### Response\"CheeseTomatoes  MushroomsOnions\".\n\n### Rationales\n1. The given situation suggests that Jimmy went to store and purchased several ingredients to create a cheese dish.\n2. Based on the four options presented, we know that cheese can be added to the list by the word \"and,\" thus it is implied that cheese exists in the sentence \"Jimmy went to the store and bought cheese.\" We can then further eliminate the option Mushrooms by removing the word \"and\" and knowing that \"and onions\" will not allow \"and\" to be removed.\n3. We also see that onions are not present in the list, which leads us to conclude that Jimmy did not purchase mushrooms and onion.\n4. Finally, we can conclude that Jimmy purchased tomatoes and cheese, which leads us to the most appropriate answer:  CheeseTomatoes  MishroomsOnions\nAnswer: cheesetomatoes", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "To calculate the number of hours needed, Camilla would determine how many batches of pizza dough and pizzas she would have to make to meet her goal of making 12 pizza.\n\n### Input : A small school, which needs to reduce expenses, wants to replace an existing vending machine with a single ice cream machine in the main area that charges $1.75 for every ice cream scoop. Students would be able to buy their ice cream with either cash or a small school ID card. If the average profit per scoop is $0.90 with a 8% sales tax and the school wants to increase the overall profit by 1% while the number of ice scoops sold stays the same, how much more ice cream should the school scoop out so that it meets this desired percentage increase?\n\n### Demostration :  When dealing with percentage increase for a certain amount of product, it is often helpful to first identify the original amount of product before deciding on the amount to increase. Let 'x' be the original product amount before the desired increase occurs and let 'y' be the desired result after the increase. \n\nHere we identify the product as $x$ scoops of ice cream \n\ny- The new product amount \n\nWe also identify the percentage increase as '0.08'. \n\nBy utilizing the formula for percentage increase, we have  \n\ny% \n\n =  x*(1+x /100)\n\nApplying this definition to our problem, we have \n\ny / 100 = x * 1.08 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 100 \n\ny = 0.08x \n\nSubstituting the original scoop quantity, x into this equation we have \n\n0.08 x = 0.01\n\nAfter simplifying the equation, our result is \n\ny = (0.08x )/5 = $20 =$20 (original ice cream) Scoops\n\nNote that while $20$ ice cream scoops is the correct answer, not every option on the quiz will include this amount exactly.

{"text": "Layla's Apple count = 20\nWe have to find the difference of the total number of apples picked amongst Maggie's, Kelsey's and Layla's.\n\nIn the question, the total number of appels picked by the three of them equals to the average number of apples that they picked.\nThis means that after they each picked the number of apples that correspond to half of their average they are left with 5 apples in total. We know the sum of the apples each person picked equals to 78.\nIf the three of them picked the first half, the number they have picked is 39.5 apples. Now by adding 6 to each half, we know that the amount that each person had left is 13 apples.\nFrom here, we can find how many apples Layla had picked. In order to find the number of apples Layla picked, we know Maggie picked 40, and Kelsey picked 40 - 13 = 27 apples, since every number from Maggie by decrementing by 5 we reach the number 40 that Layla picked.\nThis means Layla picked 20 apples.\nAnswer: 20\n\nNow on to the part about what we know and what we seek\n1. The total number of apples is 78. Since each of the answers is equal to the average, we can assume that the answers are equally divided. This means there must be 29 apples in the remaining 5 apples, and therefore one apple in each apple.\n2. After they each picked the number that corresponds to half of their average, they each have 13 apples left.\n3. Once each of the 78 apples is divided by 13, the result is 6.\n4. Using what we've found, we can find the total of the average using [40 + 40 + 44] = 124 / 6 = 20.6666\n5. Using this information, we know that of the 28 apples Kelsey picked, one can be found in each apple, so we use 28 - 1 = 27.\n\n### Input:`It's not raining on a", "answer": " 22"}

First, let's go over the types of paper boxes in the question, as it's essential to understand which boxes are involved to make sense of the question. To do this, we can compare the dimensions of both kinds of boxes with the given specifications as follows:\nOption A: The dimensions of the first type of box are as follows: height - 30 cm, width - 35 cm, and depth - 15 cm, which is less than or equal to 4(=5.5 inches) in height, as well as 6(=7.5 inches) in width and 9(=1.6 inches) in depth.\nOption B: The dimensions of the second type of box are as 34 cm in height, 20 cm in width, and 22 cm in depth.

{"text": "A few things to note: The total value of the pretzels divided by 4 is 16 pretzels per baggie. For example, if she puts 4 pretzels into each baggie, then the baggie has 4 pretzels.

However, she can put 4 goldfish into each baggie or she can also put 2 goldfish into each baggy to accommodate for the fact that they take up more space than pretzels. Then, she would be dividing the 64 goldfish into 24 baggies. Since each baggie has 32 sucklers, each baggie has 2 suckers.

In this case, with the broccoli being the largest portion, we can solve for that first. That being 12 kg X 50% = 6 kg.

{"text": "24 hours\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Find the total number of hours needed to perform the renovation.\n2. It is given that the kitchen takes 50 % longer than each bedroom, meaning that a kitchen takes  1.5x longer to renovate than each bedroom. Therefore, each bedroom takes 14 hours to renovate\n3. From the total number of hours required for each bedroom (14 hours) and for the kitchen (28 hours), the total number of hours for the renovation is then 14 hours + 28 hours = 42 hours.\n4. It is given that each bedroom takes 3 hours longer than the living room, so it takes 3x more hours than the living room. 42 hours is the same as performing 5 additional renovation times. \n5. From that we find that the total renovation time is  42 hours + 5 \u00d7 3 = 57 hours.\n6.

The answer choice choices range from $0 (the lowest possible amount) to $185 (the highest possible amount).\n\n### Step 1: Determine how many extra water bottles can be sold to cover the full cost of the friend's gift.\n\nTo calculate the value of the extra water bottles needed, we set up the equation 5 x $1.85 = $92.50, which indicates that two extra water bottles are required.\n\n### Step by Step: \n1. We will start with the total amount Lilith wants to buy the birthday gift, which is $185.\n2. We then know that she is planning to sell 5 water bottles at the regular price of $1.85 each, which adds to $9.25 or $102.75 in total.\n3. Subtracting the total amount she needs to sell (102.7). From the result you get $0. However, the question asks for the extra, so we can remove this amount from the initial $185 and recalculate this amount.\n4. $85 = $185 - $0 \n5. $85 = 3( 6.25) \n6. $85 = $(22.5)\n7. $85 - $(22.5 = $62.5\n8. $62.5 = 5(12.5)\n9. $62.25 - (12.5 =$50\n10. $62.75 = 5( $12.75)\n11. $62.625 =5($12.625)\n12. $62.850 = 5 ($12.80)\n13 $62.5 - $,80 -$5.25\n14. $61.50 - $,80 = $-1,190\n15 $-1,195 -$9.25 (The sale amount, which", "answer": " 9"}

Veronica will pit 20 cherry per minute. How long will it take Veronica? \n\n1. Let's start with the cherry. Our instructions say: Veronica needs 9 lb pitted cherries but we only know the number of cherries per pound. 80 single = 1 lb. We know that Veronica needs 3 pound but we don't know the number of whole cherries needed for 3 pounds. Therefore, we will need to figure that out. If we take 80, which is the whole cherries in 1 lb of whole cherries, and divide it by the whole cherries in a pound it equals to 3.3. Therefore 3 whole cherries= 1 pitted cherry.\n2. Next, we will figure out how many hours it takes to pit the cherries. Let's break it into two problems. To do that we'll write how many we will pit in 1 min. 80/ 20 = 4. Let's solve for how long it will take to pit the cherry. To do that we just need to divide 4 by the minute. 4/ 1 = 4.

First we need to make all the numbers into bills. Noemi played roulette and that means that $1B is equal to 100 bills. (the number of bills has no significance)\nSo, she lost $4P bills on roulette (rounded to $400B since she lost $ 400B bills) and $2Q bills on blackjack (rounded to $500B since she played blackjack that means that $5B bills were her final purse)\n\nBut, lets say she started with $3B Bills, so she started with:\n\n$7P bills on roulete\n$0Q bills on blackack and the final purse of $3B bills\n\nLet's add everything up and see what that tells us:\n\n$1B - $700B+ - $3B = $17B in total (because she ended up with $3B on her purse and lost $500B on the table)\nWe need to subtract $5B and then we'll know how much she started with.\nSo, subtracting $5B bills from $17B we end up with $12B and since she was left with $3B we have:\n\n$3b+12b=15b\n\n$3B bills were her purse ($3 bills were her purser before the game)\n$12B bills means that she won $12B bills on the game.

The more traditional exercise of counting how many individuals like French fries, how many like burgers, and how many say they do not like French fries or burgers requires a more tedious and manual process of adding and subtracting options. While the process of counting responses from the given options can often be done manually by hand, this task involves a very different approach.  Rather than have students work in isolation and manually count responses, this task requires students work together in a group to figure out the answers. While at first glance, this may seem to require more classroom time and be more cumbersome, it has several advantages.  In addition to increasing students' collaborative and teamwork skills, this task encourages students to engage in deeper processing rather than simply solving problems on the basis superficial answers and reasoning.  In this way, it is far more efficient to facilitate collaboration among students than it is to simply engage them in a group activity. \nWe also acknowledge that the answer to this particular question is most likely the total number of individuals who like neither of the two foods and that only 41 out of the class of 2", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "$63(145)\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Margaux owns a money-lending company. Her friend is paid $5 per day, she brother $8 per day and her cousin $4.\nOutput: After 7 days, she will be paid a total of 7*5*1.25 = 63.\n\n### Rationale: Firstly, it is important to note the definition of money lending, which is the practice of lending money in return for interest, or the practice of lending small amounts of money in return for a fee.\n\nThen, the question asks us to find the money the money-lending company will collect after 7 days.\n\nThe company owns the money, not the individual friends or relatives, and these friends and relatives are lending their money.\nThe company will collect a total of 7 days of money (the time they lent their money for) plus interest.\n\nThe interest is determined by the following:\n* For her friend, the friend pays $5 per day and she will be paid 5*1.28 = 6.40 + the principal amount of their money that was lent, which is 6 days * 5 = 30.\n* For her brother, the brother pays $8 per day and she will receive 8*1.28=12.80+ the principal amount of their loan, which is 7*8=58(this also means she receives 58+8).\n* For her cousin, she pays $4 per day and she receives 4*1.28+ 4=6.40+ the principal amount for their loan, which is the principal.\nThis means she will be paid a net amount of 6+58+4= 71.40 at the end of day7.\nThus, she will be paid $71.40 the amount of money, she collects after 7 days.", "answer": " 119"}

Reflect on the possible feelings or emotions related to raising money for a class field trip.\nStep 03: Evaluate the other options to determine their relevance.\nStep 04: Select the only option that makes sense.\n\nStep 01: $50 was collected to help pay for the trip.\nStep 2- Feelings or emotions: Joy, contentment, relief.\nStep 3- Select: The only option that made logical sense was the class fund. It didn't make logical sense for the students to keep the money since they did not contribute to its formation and they did not spend it.\nStep 4- The correct answer was B.\nAnswer: B. $650\n\n### Input : I need a new 90\u2019s style denim jacket.

Similarly, for our 3 pieces per pie ratio, the total number of pieces being shared out is 6 (3 pieces per pie divided by 5, the number of pies).\n\nSo, we have three pies being cut into 10 each and then divided among: 1 teacher, 12 classmats and 3 of those pieces being cut up, bringing the total number of pie to 6.\n\nNow that we have our pieces and our classmates, the next step is to count the number of remaining slices that are left.

The given problem asks about a product that is both a liquid and a shampoo/food/gasoline/dye, which indicates that there must be more than one option.\n2. We can eliminate options A: water because it is a product that is both liquid and a food, which contradicts our definition, making option A incorrect.\n3. We can also eliminate option D: Gasoline, because it is a product known to fall under the category of liquid, so it isn't really needed to explain the liquid property.\n4. This leaves us with option B shampoo, because it is both a liquid and shampoo, which makes it the correct choice.\nAnother way to solve it would be as follows: we know the given problem asks for a liquid product, so we can eliminate options F: dye, since dye is in fact a solid.\nNext, we evaluate each of the remaining options : C: shampoos is a liquid product, which makes it correct, as it fills the criteria of being both a shampoo and a liquid. \n\nOption D: food is not a liquid since it is a solid. Option E: gasoline is a liquid and a fuel, hence not needed to fill in the criteria of being both liquid and a product.\n\nIf we use this method to evaluate the correctness of an option, then option C: shampooy, is the most correct since it fulfills both criteria of being a liquid and shamopoo.

That means if they buy 10 sets of magic cards, then they would have 4*10=40 for uncommon magic cards.

Choices: \tA: 40 years and 10 months\tB: 37 years and 8 months\tC: 41 years and 6 months \tD: 43 years and 5 months\tE: 59 years and 1 month\nRationales: Given that the year is 2021, how do months of any time period add up to the number of months in any given year?\nSo, since December 25 2021 is the last day of the month, we can see that the month 12, cannot add to itself as one month has 30 days while the other one has 29. Therefore, we know that it is 19 years and 3 months. Then since the time is 2 am, we can infer that it is in the year 2002. But since it is 3am, it would mean that it is in 2082. And since on Christmas day, nobody works, and it is very unlikely that people would be at their job at this point of time in the late night, we can infer that the options are incorrect. Finally, December 25, would be in the year 2198, with December month being the year 2022 so we add these two to it, and get a total of 2023.\nAnswer: A, B, C, D, and E are all wrong.

What is your travel time total per trip?\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer: 70 minutes\n\n1. Since this question asks what the travel time total will be and the question is in the future tense. The travel time for each trip is calculated by dividing the overall travel time by 2 to find the travel time per trip. The sum of these two components is what determines the total travel time per trip.\n2.The first part of the question asks to answer what it would take Alice to travel the same way to 2 stores. This means that the first trip Alice goes on takes her to a store that doesn't matter, while the second trip takes her to another store that doesn't really matter.\n3. The second part of the question is about Alice traveling the same way to 35 minutes. \n4. Alice would travel the same way to another store that doesn\u2019t matter. \n5. So Alice takes 2 trips to a total of 36 minutes.\n6. We would divide this into 18 minutes for a single trip with the remaining 18 minutes as the time to wait for Alice to complete the 2nd trip.\n7.

He's already made three of the 6th and a single dollar. If the goal is to make $600. he needs to sell eight more cookies to get one dollar. How many cooks is he going to sell to pay for the team?\nRationales: Given what was known about Jack, the bake sale and the uniforms, the first thing is to figure out the cost of the team's uniform.\nUniforms, for a team that has eight players, would cost an additional $ 16.\nThere would be 12 team members, including the coach who needs a uniform.\nAs already noted in the instructions above, there are four brownies for $ 3 and each of five lemon squares for $ 2 for a total of $ 4+ $ 4 + 4 + 10 = $ 20.\nThis also means that the remaining $ 40 must be the cost of an additional eight uniforms, meaning that the uniforms cost approximately $ 5 per person.\n\nNow that we have established the cost of the uniform, let's assume that Jack is able to sell each uniform at $ 5. This means the cost of the uniform will be $ 5 x 12 = 60.\nIn this scenario, Jack needs a total money of $ 606.\nIt is necessary to earn as much money as possible as each dollar is needed to help the team.\nSo, in order to meet the goal, Jack needs to sell 155 more sweets of $4.00, which means that Jack needs to sell 710 more sweets for the total cost of $ 600 06.\nWith each cookie worth $ 4, the total profit is $ 1220.\nJack made a $ 1224 profit while helping the basketball team and its coach.\n\n### Feedback\n\nGood work so far.

After the purchase, bad credit card buyer will end up with an over-limit which will automatically trigger an overdraft protection, if there is one, and the card will be maxed out, meaning that no more purchases can be made with it. The question then becomes who cancels the credit card: the credit card issuer or the borrower himself.

Janet has to pays 10% of their salaries in FICSA taxes. FICA taxes are made of two parts. The first is the employee's share of the Social Security tax, which has a rate of 6.2% (that is, 6.2% of your salary). This brings $18.42 per hour in total. The other part is the employee's half of the Medicare tax. This has a rate of 1.45% and brings a total of 2.85 per hour.\n\n3. Hence total FICSA taxes equals 10% of total wages, or 10% of $30, or $3 total per hour: $18.45 + 2.85 = $31.30 for FICA taxes for this month, or $62.60 for six workers.\n\n4. Janet also pays herself as manager. So total salaries from wages and FICA taxes (the last step) is $3600 per month.\n\n5. Janet has to give 7% to her workers and herself. 7% (the total amount) is given on total wages. So 7% (the amount) of total salaries is $360.\n\n6.

{"text": "I found the shoes and dress to be worth 70 dollars total. I then subtracted the dress sale price from the total I found. I get $70 - $80 = $10.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the instruction.\n\n### Input : If Daniela purchases two pairs of shoes originally in _40 percent off_ and one dress originally _20 percent_ off. How much money does she spend in total?\n\n### Demostration:\nThere is $20 of each item being marked off.\n\n### The key step to solve this question:\nThe initial amount is $20. Take the $20 off the initial price if the percent is the same. \n\n### The answer is $18. Because $20 off $80 is $20. The initial price is $80 subtracted by the $20 is $60. Then $60 is $18. \n \n### Response:\nThe initial amount of shoes and the initial amount of the dress is $80 each. Therefore, there were a total of three items, hence there are three pairs of shoes.\n\n### 1. Divide the initial amount of money with the discount percent.\n\n### Example:\nIf you wanted to find the percent, you would have to take the initial price, which is $80. Then divide the initial price by 1.40 and the result would be $10 = 0.10. If you would take that value and move it into the equation to solve for the 40% off the $80, the result would be $80 - ($80*40%*0.10) = $80 - $32 = $48.\n\n\n### 2. Now, use the same procedure to find the percent of the other price.\nThere's another pair of shoes left in the question. Find the initial price first, which is $82. Then divide the initial value in the $82 by 20%, which would be $82 / 0.20 = $410. Now, take that same value and find the initial price so it's $410 - $", "answer": " 140"}

The key to figuring the answer is in the statement: \"3 times as many votes Barry.\" \n\nTo determine the number of votes Marxy received, we need to first determine the number of votes Barry received.\nWe can first determine Barry's votes by subtracting Barry's votes twice as 3 from Joey's votes and adding that number to the total of votes, 8.\n3 + 2(8-3) = 21\n\nWe know from the previous calculation that Barry received 21 votes. \n\nWe still need to determine how many votes Marcy received.\nTo do so, we need to multiply Barry's 21 votes by 3. \n\nMultiplying 21 times 3 tells us that Marcy received 63 votes, which is her grade.\nThus, the correct Answer is 63.\nAnswer: 63", "answer": " 66"}

{"text": "The correct answer is 54. We need to find the hourly rate 1.5 times the $12 per hour. To do this, we need to know how many hours he is paid for. Divide $696 by 40, and we get 17.34 per hour. Add 1.5 to that, and we get $21.05. If we want to pay for 54 hours, we need to multiply 54 times $21.04. The answer 54 times $1149.72 = $60,960.\n\n### Rationale:  Step 1: \nWhat is the most correct and accurate way to solve problems involving payments and wages?\n\nTo solve problems involving payments, deductions, and wages, we will first convert hours worked into dollars earned, calculate the gross pay based on this amount by multiplying the dollars earned by one-to-one, and then subtracting any deductions the worker receives, such as taxes, benefits, or bonuses. \n\nThe key thing to remember is to keep the calculations accurate and maintain consistency in the approach for calculating the gross and net pay of a worker. Avoid making any errors that could result in incorrect deductions or over- or underpayments. \n\nExample: Calculating gross pay for a worker who earns a fixed rate of $8.00/hr with no deductions.\n\nCalculate the gross pay for a worker by multiplying the hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, you would multiply 40 by $20, which is $ 800 in gross pay. \n\nThe worker receives a gross pay of $800 and no deductions, so the net pay would be the same as the gross pay. \nAnswer: $800\n\nStep 2: \nThe person might have had too many sick days and ended up working a few extra days/hours.\n\nStep 3: \nLet's first find the amount of $12 earnings.\nA lot of people have gone sick at Gary's worksite, so he is working more hours.\n\nLet's write a simple expression like this `$$$ 696 = 12 * x` to find the value.

{"text": "The answer is 5.75 inches of rain per day.\n\n### Input\n\nThe first step of the process is to analyze the input and extract relevant information that directly points to the correct answer.\n\nThe question asks for the daily average rain total during a particular week, and it provides us with several pieces of information, such as the amount of rain that fell on each day and the total amount of rain during the week.\n\nBy analyzing the context and the information provided, we can determine that the average daily total must be calculated by summing up all the recorded amounts of rain and then dividing the total by the number of days in the week.\n\nIn this case, the rain fell on Monday and Tuesday with a total of 2 inches, then twice that much on Tueday and on Tuesday, it did not rain at all. The biggest storm was recorded on Friday, when the total was equal tot the combined amounts from Monday through Thursday, which means that it rained three times as much as on the remaining days of the week put together.\n\nThis information makes it possible to solve the problem and provides a solid logic that can be used to determine the answer.\n\n### Response\n\nThe solution to the problem requires us to find the average daily amount of rain for the week, which can be calculated as the sum of the recorded amounts divided by the number of days:\n\n```JavaScript\n    let total = 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 3\n    let answer = total / 5\n    let total_after = total - answer\n    answer += round(total_after)\n```\n\nIf the result is close to 5.75, then the answer is accurate.\n\nIn this problem solution, we can see that the answer, a rounding approximation of 5.75 (based on the provided data), makes it easy to confirm that it can be considered as the correct response.\n\nOnce this answer is found, we can confidently confirm that it is likely to be the correct response to the input problem.\n\n### Revision:Write a sentence that uses the word \"claim\" as a verb.\n\nThe best answer to this revision is this.\n\nI claim that my answer is correct according to the provided information and the logic used to determine the solution.\n\n### Finalization\n\n\nI have made", "answer": " 4"}

From this information, we can infer that he previously had fewer tomatoes than his neighbours. \n\nNow we can form hypotheses as to the relationship between their original number and the number of tomatoes they currently have, given that his neighbours have acquired 4 more tomatoes. \n\nOption A: 134 is a number in the middle of a known range, suggesting that the relationship may be linear (148-134 is the average difference). The number of tomatoes Haruto would have to give up to satisfy his neighbours can thus be represented by \\(x-y = 4\\), where \\(x = 134\\), \\(y = 138\\), and 4 is the unknown number of tomatoes his neighbours acquired. From here, we solve for \\(x\\) by substituting \\(y = 148 - 4\\) for \\(y\\), then \\(x = 144 - (148 - 5) = 140 - 148 + 5 = 21\\), which is our correct answer.\n\nRationales: This year Haruto also has 138 fewer tomatoes than his neighbor. From this information, it is possible that his neighbors originally did not have any of Haruto's tomatoes, in which case Haruto would have 138 more tomatoes than his neighbor this year. \nWe can test this hypothesis by determining what amount of tomatoes (x) Haruto would need to remove to satisfy his neighbours, by setting up an equation where \\(x-y = (138-138)\\), \\(x = 176 - (148-4) = 122 - (134-4) = 32\\)\nThis is a", "answer": " 54"}

However, this type of thinking doesn't account for the fact that the currency is different, in this case dollars and Euros. Therefore, we need to convert the 10% from one unit to another unit by using the rate. To simplify, we will use a similar calculation for 250 dollars at 10% off and 240 euros at 10%off.\n\nFirst, we should note that 10% of 240 equals 24 euros.\n\nTherefore,\n\n250 dollars at a 10% discount converted to euros would be (\n\n$240  x 0.1 = \u20ac24\n\nThis would be,\n\n10% of \u20ac240  = \u20ac24\nor\n 10% of the same amount in dollars would be $24\n\nTherefore, \n\n10% off 250 dollars is\n\n($250 * 0.1 = $25)\n\n10% discount from 240 eu is\n\n(240 * 0.9) euros\n\nThe total savings is the sum of these two amounts:\n\n($25 + (240 * 9.1) = $270.10)\n\nConsequently, the total difference in price between the selling price of $950 and \u20ac920 is $70.10.\n\n### Input  : What can a person receive in exchange for giving away a bicycle?

Dividing 186 by two gives 93 as the amount each person should pay.\n\n## Rationale\n\n1. The task asks to find out how much each person paid.\n2. There are two people so the total number of hours must be 4 hours or 4(8). This means number of hours must be either 8 or 4. However, we have learnt that each person paid for 8 hours, which is less than the total number of hours so 1 hour remains, which reduces the number of hours to 3 hours.\n3. Therefore, number of hours is 3 and since there were two people, the number of hours taken by one person will be 3 and by another will be 2.\n4. So number of hours taken by each person is 2 and 3.\n5. Therefore, we multiply number of hours by cost to get total cost.\n6. 5(3) = 15 and 4(4) = 16.\n7. Subtracting the cost from the total payables by both people gives us the amount payable by each person which is 93.\n8.

Since the question is asking why \"individuals,\" this indicates it is a generic reason not a personal one.\n\n-Education: This is a generic reason why people may not attend college i.e. they may be unqualified to attend college level courses. We exclude this answer.\n\n-Time restrictions: Time plays a role in most people's lives and it is a factor that has a direct impact on people's decision making process. This can be linked to the reason people don't attend college as time can limit a person's ability to attend college by leaving less time to attend. \n\n-Education, we can see is a cause behind the reason why individuals may not go to college because college requires a certain education and/or the courses may seem too difficult to enroll into and take without having a college relevant education prior.\n\n-Time, it can limit people's decision making and in some scenarios, prevent them from enrolling into college. It can also limit how much time a person has to study, resulting in a lower grade since the individual is unable to complete homework and study properly because of time.\n\n### Conclusion: The answer is E: Time, since there may be obstacles in the way of someone from attending college, either through a low GPA, lacking experience, or not having enough time, thus resulting in a lack of motivation to", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "The only option that offers him the potential to make that $10 mark is the second option, for the repair of two toilets and 5 sinks.\n\n### Rationale\nIn order to make the $10, the plumber must get the opportunity to fix 7 more sinks.

In total, he has the ability to fix 7 sinks, and he had originally been offered an opportunity to fix 5 with the second option.

{"text": "#### Write out your solution\n  > $3000-$700-$500-$100=**$1950**\n\n### Rationales\n\nThe question is asking us to calculate the amount of money that someone has left after purchasing an item, returning another item and selling one. Let's apply the principle of deductive approach which states that the formula to calculate the quantity in terms of the value is as follows:\n\n**amount = value - quantity purchased - quantity returned - profit made.**\n\nThe first step to solve this kind of problems is to identify the **quantity purchased** as it represents the **initial cost** or the amount of money someone had to start with. In this case, James starts with 3000 dollars.\n\nNext, we identify the **quantity returned** as it represents the final cost to James or the amount of money that he still requires to reach **zero** in his account that is the **initial cost + profit made.** \n\nThe third step is to identify the **profit made** which represents the amount of money that was made from a sale or discount on an item. For us, we have that James sold a bike.\n\nOur final step is to calculate the **amount** or the balance for James or how much he still has to pay for which by subtracting the quantity purchased (3000) and the quantity returned (1950), we get the 1050 dollars left which is the required amount. \n\nAnswer:\n\n**$1050**\n\n#### Discussion:\n\nThe deductive approach can be applied to other similar, real life problems but it may take more time to go through all the calculations and it might be difficult to solve questions if quantities that require more complex calculations if they exceed a certain level.", "answer": " 2020"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C: 5 hours.\n\nStep 1: Identify key tasks: The key task is to count up the number of tasks under \"Clean the house\" and subtract it from the number of tasks under each of the sub-items for that task.\nStep 2. Identify possible state(s): The possible states are whether each task takes 10 minutes or whether the tasks take 0, 5 or 10 minutes. The possible state under each section is either the total number of tasks minus one, which is equal to 4 in the case of the \"Clean the House\" tasks or the total number of tasks multiplied by the individual task time, which is 14 minutes in the case of the individual \"Take a shower\" or \"Make Dinner\" tasks, as there is only one.\nStep 3. Reflect on each state and evaluate each:\n\nThe state whether each task takes 0 minutes\nWe subtract one from the total number of tasks, which equals 4 and we get as the result 0. This state is true only if each task takes 0 minute instead of 5 or 11 minutes respectively.\nThe option C: whether each task takes 5 minutes must be checked first as it fits the state 'whether each task takes 0'\nThe state whether each takes 11 minutes\nWe multiply the total number of tasks in the item by the task time, which equals 14 and we get as a result 110 minutes. This state is true if each task \"Take a shower,\" \"Make dinner\" takes 5 minutes or 10 minutes instead of 10 minutes.\nThe option C also fits this state.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer: The correct answer is C: Trey must count 4 tasks which each take 10 minutes. That is a total of 40 minutes and 240 minutes for the \"take a shower\" and \"make dinner\" tasks. For the clean the house tasks, we have 7 tasks which each take 5 minutes. That equals a total of 35 minutes and 140 minutes for the total tasks. The total is therefore 10 hours and 340 minutes.

{"text": "Option 1:\n\n### Rationale: We have all the information required for determining that the first throw was 525 meters long.\n### Let's do some math.\n\n### 1.

Subtract the third throw from the total in 2 to get 800 meters.\n\n### Final Thinking: There are 100 one-meter cubes from a one kilometer run. \n### If this javelin travels the same distance as a kilometer, we can simply say the distance from the initial throwing is five blocks.  If it is half that, it is two blocks.  I can easily convert the 5th block, as it is easy to know how many meters there are in a block.  So I subtract the three blocks from his throws.

The goal is to determine the total length of the rope given the amount of knots and the value for each additional knot.  \n\n### Step1:Determine what information exists, and what does not exist\n-   Knots is a measurement that cannot be used to infer the length of the rope.\n-   Length between each 2-foot ropes cannot be used to infer either.\n-   The length between each 20-foot of rope can be directly deducted from provided value, which is 8 feet.\n-   We also know that each additional knot will lose 1.2 feet of additional length, since each 2-foot was lost during the knotting process\n  - Since the value of 3 is provided, that should be used to deduce the total length after 2 extra knots are performed on each of the 3 2-foot rope sections. The value for the 4th knot must be found in that situation in order to obtain the total length.\n-   The value 8 can also be used to deduce additional length from the one 8 foot 20-foot-long rope initially found.\n  - There needs to be accounting for the length lost by adding the 3 kots to the 2-2-foot 2-foot robes of a 20-120-feet-long rope.\n\n### Step 2: Reflect and consider how the information relates to the question \n- The 8-foot 20-foot and the 2-foot 7-foot ropes are provided with a single-digit numbers that cannot be used to find a value. The only way to determine their total length is through deduction methods.\n  - We know that the total length after 3 knots for each of the 2-foot robe sections of the 8 and 120-foot long ropes will be 21 foot. The length, therefore 21.2 foot, can be compared to the provided value to determine the total length. \n-", "answer": " 35"}

This should be no less than six steps.\n1. The Question itself is: What should you do with a ______?\n2. We know the subject of the question is Animal\n3. So, What should you do with + + animal.\n4. We know there is no article in front of Animal, so animal can be substituted for a plural noun.\n5. So to ask the question what would you do with the plural word in the question, a, b, or c?\n6. An easy search shows the word a is to be omitted so I will take this question to mean, what should you do with a animal?\n7. Based off of context clues, we know that a sick animal is in mind. The context clues include the word \"What\" and \"How\" in this question. \"What should you do with\" is most often used when talking about things that are sick, so this is the most likely case. The second clue is the use of the word \"sick.\"\n8. So the answer to this question would be \"take it to the vet", "answer": " 44"}

The trick is to count the other rooms available to Hans, without including the floor that is not available for the guests.\n\nFor example, 5 floors are available, 10 rooms per floor. 5 * 10 = 50 rooms. The other 5 floors are unavailable to the guests, hence there are in those 5 floors a total of 10 * 10 = another 100 rooms.\n\nThus, the total number of rooms available to Hans will be:\n\n50 + 100 = 150\n\nTo count the number of possible combinations, each floor-room combination will be picked randomly once, with the 10th floor being excluded.

{"text": "George paid $14 for his food.\n\n**\nReasoning and work:**\n\nFor a trip for george, he decided to buy food items: a bottle of milk, a sandwich and a bottle of juices, and he got the food items at very competitive prices.\n\n- A bottle of juice cost 2* the juice. This implies that the juice was very cheap or very expensive and I can't make a conclusion about it.\n- The sandwich was at a cost of 4$.\n- The bottle of milk was 75% its cost. This implies that it was very cheap.\nWhenever we apply 75% discount to the total cost, we always get that the final product always cost 9.375$ which I got and converted it into a decimal which is 93.75%.\nTo sum up the answer, 93.7% is what I got.\n\nNow if you compare the bottled milk and the total cost of the food items, it is easy to understand. As the bottled milk was very cheap so I multiplied it by 93.7%, however for the juice and sandwich I added 2*$3$ and 4,75, respectively, then I multiplied the sum by 93.25% and it came to be $14.\n\n**References:**\n\n- https://www.mathsisfun.com/percent-discount-calculator.html\n\n- https://math.tutorvista.com/mixed-num\n\n### Instructions:Write one paragraph to answer each of the given questions.\n\n### Question 1:Would you rather be a student or a professional?\n\nAs a student, I would never get so involved in professional activities, nor would a single working day bring me too much stress.

How many dog leashes do you need to sell to get at least $185?\n\n### Answer1: 3\n\n### Answer Explanation: The total amount of money you need to reach first is $50. The amount of leashes you need to sell is 3. This is how you get to $50. $50 - $185 = -$135 \nso you need to subtract $135 to get to $50 because you can't sell a dog leash for more than $50. \nSo if you sell $50 - $3*= $22 is profit and subtract the price of 3 leashes then the rest is profit=78 \n\n### Input2:What part of city is farthest away from where you are studying?

{"text": "The actual distance between the towns, is 6.8 miles. 1/4 in means one map segment or one map point is equal to 8 miles, we can therefore see that there are 3 segments between the towns. The actual distance is the sum of both town segments, which is 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 miles. We need to convert each of the three map points to represent miles. A map point is 8 miles so we multiply the map points by 8/1 to get miles.\n\n\nThe segment is 3 map points so we multiply the segment by 8/3 to get miles.\nThe second segment is like the first but this time, it is 3 3/16 instead of 3 3/2 so we multiply that by 8/3 and get 10.56 miles.\nFinally, the first segment is 3 7/8 and we multiply it by 8/2 to get 11 miles so the answer is simply 6.8 miles which is close to 7 miles but I added that decimal because it rounded to 7 and even though technically, it was very close, you must be accurate to the actual number.\n\n### Challenge:\n##### Instruction:\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: What is a 6 year old called?

Given that Patrick was born 2 years after Robert was born then Patrick was 26 when Robert was 30. \n\nBy adding the number 2 to 26 we reach the number 28, which was the age of Robert when Patrick was born.\n\nTherefore, Robert was 30 years old when Patrick was born and Patrick is younger than Robert by two years. \nAnd so based on the fact that Patrick is now 16 years old and two years from now Robert will be 30 then the fact that Robert was 3o when Patrick was born is not relevant and we can reason that Patrick is now 26\n\n###Input:\nPatrick is half of the age of his elder sibling, brother Robert is 30 after two years, how old is now Pattrick?\n\n###Input2:\n\nLet us define the variables: \nage(Robert) = 30\nage(Patrick) = 15\nage(Patricks' older sibling) = T\n\nLet us first repharse the question \nPatrick is younger than 2 times the age of his older sibling while the age of his brother is 30 years later than 2.\n\nThe second part is that is the age of his older bro is equal to 30 two years before or after the date he was born. So in this case his older brother was 30 years in 2018 which means he was born in 1988.\n\nNow to answer the question we need to replace T with 1988 and T with 15 and we get the equation\nagePatrick = 15/2 = 7 years ago", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "First, let's do a bit of math and figure out how many bales of grass the farmer has on hand in December by multiplying the number of acres he planted with the assumed yield per acre. Therefore, the farmer will have on average 405 bales of grass.\nNext, let's determine how many bales they use in a single day.

The total for it is 5 points with 2 points for reggie and the total is 3. \n\nI assume that he brother shoots 6 of free throws for 10 shots so it will be 7 points in total for the brother, so that means that reggie has 3 less for a total of 9, and since reggie has 1 more layup than his brother, it is 10-1 so he will lose 2 points.

The woman pays the company $25 per week, but the man only pays when the job is finished. How many weeks will the man pay?\n\n### Demostraton:\nThe answer for this question is E: 1\n\nThe woman pays a total of $25 for the company for each week of the job which makes $50 total. The man needs to pay for the job when the job is done in order to pay the company $25 total. For this to happen, the job needs to be completed 2 times which makes the number of weeks the man will pay $1.\n\n### Response\n\nThis job needs 50$ to be done before the woman needs to pay. Since the job is done twice, the man has to pay twice to complete the job and for the woman to pay. The woman needs to pay 25$ each week. That makes a total of 50$ in total pay for this job. If this job is completed then the man needs to pay when the job is done. Given those two assumptions, then the man will have to pay once, for the job. If they don\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t do the job. That implies that the man only needs to pay for this job if the job is completed 2 times.

Given that Max spent different times doing his homework tasks, it is necessary to add the time spent on each subject.\n\nBy adding the time spent on each of the activities, we can calculate the total amount of time it took to complete all of Max's tasks.\n\nTherefore, we can answer the question \"How much time did Max spend doing his homework?\" by subtracting history and geography from biology and adding the whole time he spent in each subject.\nWe must consider that the task of history required him to complete two times more than biology since the other subject.\nHistory therefore took 2 * 20 = 40 minutes more than biology.\nGiven that history took three times Biology, history took max 120 minutes.\nHistory took max 125 because geography took 3 times more than history.\n\nMax spent max three times more in geography than he did in biology and he spent more than 2 hours in biology so he spent max two hours on doing homework.\n\n### Input :What is a best way to help prevent you and others getting the cold or flu?\n\n###Response : Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

{"text": "The question asks how many different kinds of rock would be found in a canyon's strata, if a total of 25 different layers consisted of 13 types of rocks.\n\nSince the question was stated as a ratio question, the first step to solving the problem is to identify the information provided. Here, the amount of different types of rocks is the ratio (25:13), and the amount of types of rocks we aim to find is 1 (the number of rocks not included in the ratio).\n\nStep 2: Identify the data in the relationship between the numerator and divisor. Since the amount of different types in the ratio are the numerator and the types of rocks to be found are the divisor, we can identify that the amount that is being divided (and what we aim to find) is 25.\n\nStep 3: Identify what is common to the two amounts in the ratio and what is different. Since the amount is the same (25), the part that varies from the ratio is the number of types of rocks to be divided by.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate our options. As indicated above, the only options that need to be considered are sandstone, quartz, limestone, and shale. In terms of being a layer of rock or not being of rock, there are only two options: is a type of rock or is not. \n\nTo evaluate, let's see if any other answer options make sense:\n\nOption A: A mixture of sandstone, limestone, and quartz. This answer does not make sense, as we cannot have a mixture of rocks.\nOption B: A mixture of sand, quartz, and limestone. This answer does not either, as rock is different than what makes up a rock.\nOption C: A mixture of limestone and shale. This answer does not as well, as shale is only one of the layers mentioned, and it would need to be with another of those layers to make sense here.\nOption D: A mixture of sand and shale. This is the only option left, despite the fact that it is the wrong formula. \n\nThis leaves us with option D: A mixture of the sand and shale. Therefore, it is the correct answer: D: a mixture of sand and shales.\n\n### Input\n\nI need a statement about a", "answer": " 3"}

He worked at this new speed for 15 minutes.\nThe question has 30 minutes total. With an unchanged rate, Kris is able to blow up at most 3 balloon per minute. Since she didn\u2019t change her rate of working, she only had the opportunity to enlist the help of 3 of her brother each time she is working. She would need to do this for 4 whole minutes. After that, Kris is working at the original rate and her brother is working at the original speed of 2x.\nBecause they are working at the original rate, no one is able to overtake the other\u2019s work and increase the speed. That means Kris would be blowing balloon on average for 4 minutes, while her brother is blowing 2 balloon each minute for 16 minutes. Together, they will blow up only 2 of them in 16 minutes. They will blow up a total amount of 4 balloons per minute, and will finish off the 30 minutes with exactly 20 balloon each.\nAfter 15 minutes, the brother doubled the speed. At this point, he can blow up a baloon in 1 minute. After 15 more minutes, he works at this rate. He has 15 minutes.

Hiring a consultant refers to \"a person called in as an expert to give advice on specialized subjects or in particular situations.\" We can consider consultants to be people who are called in to give advice and help. Hiring is used here referring to \"the action of a business of employing a person who is not already in its employment and paying them to work for them in some capacity.\"The company's performance isn't what consultants can evaluate and the evaluation of their own company isn't their purpose.\nOption B: Hiring a consulting firm: Hiring a consultancy firm doesn't make sense here.

In this case, a company wouldn't be hiring a person, but instead, a firm.\nOption C: Consumer goods that have a value of $10 million could be evaluated.

{"text": "First, let's work backwards with the tax, as it is the easiest amount to do so. There's a set rate of 8.25% of the bill, so the amount of tax in total = the tax rate \u00d7 the bill.\n8.25% * total bill = $2.63\n\nThen, let's determine total bill by finding the sum of samosas, samosa prices, and pakoras, sum of pakora prices, and the price for a mango lassis, and totaling them\n$2 + $18 + $9 + $18 + 2.63 = $49.43  \n\nNext, let's determine the final bill by taking the total bill and subtracting tax\n$49.43 - $2.63 = 46.80  \n\nNotice that tax is the only part of this equation which we know the final amount. Thus, we can cross multiply and rearrange the equation to determine the final cost of bill:\nHilary's bill = 46.70 * (100 % - 8.25%) = $40.18  \nNotice that we don't need to memorize the percentages. The value of x in this problem can simply be determined by finding the difference between the bill and tax. This will give us the percentage of tax, which is always 100% minus the percentage of tax.\n\n### Further Work:\nOnce we've done the multiplication, we can determine that the rate of tax is 8.25%. This can be demonstrated on a number line and verified by dividing 99.75%/8.25%. It is true that the rate is always going to be 100 % minus the percentage of tax; this just happens to be the case here.\n\n### Hint for further work:\n\nWe know that the total bill was $49.40, or $(100%-$18.00)$.

The denominator (x+y)/2 = 16 + 4 = 20.\n7. This means that the common denominator is 20 (2*10).\n8. Let\u2019s plug in these two values into the equation.

The context of the question suggests that it is referring to an object that can open a specific type of nut, such as a hex nut or a socket.\n2. Therefore, we can eliminate the options that do not refer to any type of tool.\n3. The option T: Torque is discarded, because a torque tool is a device that is specifically used for turning, not opening.\n4. Option W: Woodruff is discarded, because Woodruff wrenches are used for fine adjustments and their only function is gripping and turning objects, not removing or opening them.\n5. The same reasoning applies to option T2: Screws. Screws are used to join two pieces of material together and do not typically open or remove nuts.\n6.

And double 48 will be Rahim's double is 120 and Andy's will also be 120, making it both 120. However, that is not the proper logic.

{"text": "There are two key steps to this question. First, you must calculate the amount of money to spend at the store, and second, you must apply simple arithmetic to add up the values you find.\nLet's start with the first step. \nFirst, Randy spends $2 every time he goes to one of the different stores. Now, for an entire store a person goes to it usually comes with a little discount. So, each time Randy go to the store he pays $2 for the item plus 2$ tax. This means that in total Randy spends 4.2$. Because the question asked him how much money did he have at the end in a year, instead of dividing 104$ over 12, the answer is 8.6$ instead (divide 104 by 12)\nNow, step two. We add up all the values we found for each month (8$ and 2$ to the $8.6$; to get $8+) and we get $104$ instead of $104$ as given. This is because there is a $+1$ on the last number to match the question asked.\n```\nNow the sum is $104$. The question asks for the one that was in his pocket at the beginning of the year. We can know it is the first one given ($104$ dollars) since it is the only one he had left after his shopping.\nTherefore, there are two possible answers:\nA: Randy had $104$ dollars into the piggy bank after shopping.\n\n\nB: Randy had $86$ dollars into the piger bank after shopping. In fact, the answer must be one of these two options since it is the only two possible values.\n```\nAnswer:\nA: $104$; or, B: $86$; or, C: both A and B are plausible.\nThe answer to the question: Randy had $______ dollars into the pig bank after shopping. \n### Additional Note:\nA lot of people have a wrong interpretation of the question. \nIf you look at the answer you will notice it tells us we need to know how much money had Randy in the piggy bank at the beginning of the 1st year of the story.", "answer": " 200"}

If we were to add all these up, they add to $104 making the question, \"How much will Greg and Earl together have in dollars once all their debts are paid?\"\n2. Determine who owes money to whom, drawing a line between each pair of debtors:\n3. In this question, there are 6 debtors: Greg (28$), Earl (40$), Fred - the only one owing money twice (48$ twice), Earl again (36$ once), and Greg again (40$).\n4. In order to determine the total balance, we need to understand which of the 6 debtors are owed money by another.\n5. In this question, among the 6 debtor in this question, Earl owes money to Fred, but Fred DOES NOT OWE GREG any money. Greg owes money to Earl.\n6. This information can be easily deduced in the following simple way:\n7. Step 1 : In the given, all have to make sure they are in the list of debtor. Earl, Greg, Fred all are in the list of Debtor. So, we know Earl is the only one that is in the list but owes to somebody else.\n8. Step 2: In order to draw a debt relationship between the debtor, we add the numbers of the debtor's amount owed to others with the sum of the debtor' total balance. This gives us the overall sum of 88+8+68+90+9+68=104.\n9.

Input: Which do you need more: 4 apples, 5 bananas, or 5 oranges?\n\n2. Answer: 4 apples and 5 oranges.\n3. Rationale: The question's statement \"you need four apples, five bananas, and five oranges\" suggests that you would need to have all three items, one of each kind, to have a total of 12 items. However, this is not the case since the answer is one of the options.\n\n4. Here is a question where the answer choice is not B: 7 oranges: \n\n5. Rationales: The answer choices A: 5 of the first and 2 of the second or choice B: 6 of the first and 3 of the second are incorrect because they are the wrong number of each fruit to have a total of twelve. A:5 of the first and2 of the second would be 7 apples and 5 bananas. B", "answer": " 12"}

This can be seen in the question's example of putting sprinkles on icing, which further exemplifies by the action of making or baking a cake. Similarly, choosing different routes to get to the grocery would refer to the process and act of transportation or baking, making this type of process a form of Baking.\n\n### Answer:Baking\n\n### Input\nIn the book, \"The Secret Life of Pets\" the female rabbit, Gidget, is described a having two long white ears and four paws. Which type of animal is this description most likely referring to? Choices:  C: Dogs E: Rats G: Raccoons F: Ducks\nRationales: Given the description, we can first eliminate options E: rats and G: raccoons. Rats' ears are short, and raccoons' ears are small. \n\nSimilarly, we can eliminate option F: ducks. Ducks' ears are medium-sized and evenly spaced, making them much different from the description.\n\nThe remaining two options are E: rats and C: dogs. However, rats' ears are short while the description says long ears. Thus, rats are not the ideal answer, which leaves C: dogs. \n\nSince dogs have two pairs of long ears, we can be confident that this description is referring to a dog.\n\nAnswer", "answer": " 32"}

{"text": "The answer is C.\n\nFirst, we count the amount of floors the elevator is on at each stop to find the floors where the elevator changes direction, such that the total number of floors before the elevator reverses direction is equal to the total number of floored after the elevator reverses. In this scenario, there are two directions of change, meaning there is a reversal once the elevator is on floors 9 and 16. This means that, out of the 19 floors mentioned in the prompt, there are 16 total non-reversing floors that the elevator will travel on each direction before the elevator reversals.\n\nSince, the first reverse of direction happens on floor 9, we subtract 1 from 9 to find the amount of floors there are left:\n`n = 9-1 \u2192 n = 8`\n\nFor the second reverse of direction at floor 16, we again subtract 1 to find how many floors are left:\n`m = 16-1 \u2192 m = 15`\n\nNow, we can use these values to find the total number of floos, such that:\n`floor_number = m + n \u2192 floor_number = 15+8 = 23`\n\nIn the end, there are 23 floors total. \n\n### Input:\"Dogs can be bred to produce litters of up to 18 puppies.\" How many litters could a mammal bred in a given year produce?\n\n### Output:\"6900\"\n\n### Response:`\nWe are given that dogs can breed to produce litters of 18 puppes which translates to 1 litter of 18 pups each year. The logic to derive the answer is to use the 6900 which means that to produce a litter of 15 pupsi a dog will need to be bred for 6900 years. The only year in which there is enough time for a dog to produce 15 pups is the first year and so we have a total of 6900 dog years. Finally, 6900/15 is the number of dog litters possible in 20 years.\nAnswer:\"6900/20", "answer": " 13"}

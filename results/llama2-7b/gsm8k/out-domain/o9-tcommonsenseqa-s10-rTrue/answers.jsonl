{"text": "was helping the garden her plants would ________ on her. Choices:  A. bend B. flourish C. die D. drown E. shrive\nRationales: It may be difficult to identify the exact word missing in the question, but by using context clues and common sense, we can determine what is likely the correct answer. \n1. A green thumb refers to a person having excellent gardening skills, producing beautiful plants and flowers. \n2. Therefore, someone who failed to have a green thumb would unlikely have beautiful flowers, which could reasonably be interpreted to mean that their plants died.\n3. The question implies that this person, despite the best intentions, was unable to maintain alive their plants, which seem to die from trying to help them.\n4. Therefore, the correct word here is D: DROWN.\nAnswer: D.Drown\n\nInput: It is important to be careful when eating what? Choices:  Choices A: bread B: carotts C: apples D: eggs E: potatoes\nRationales: The clue here is to remember that \"It is important to be careful.\" \nWith the above statement, we don't need to look at all the options, as this instruction implies we need to focus on just one food type.\n\n1. Eating bread (option A) is not necessarily dangerous, but rather a cultural and historical choice, with the majority of societies choosing to consume bread.\n2. Similarly, eating carrots (option B), eggs (option D), or potatoes (option E) is not considered dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the best option to pick is either C: Apples or D: Eggs.\n\n3. It is, however, important to remember the previous statement, \"to be careful.\" Therefore, it's likely the safest answer that's the most applicable is D: Eggs, which is the most likely answer.\nAnswer: D Eggs\n\nInput: Why is the doctor looking for your eyesight in dim light?

{"text": "would grow flowers, they turned out dead. Choices:  A. Yellow B. Pinky C. Purple D. Rusty E. Brown\nRationales: The question asks us to interpret the phrase \"she sure didn't have... green thumb.\" We can start by looking at the literal meaning of it. A \"green thumb\" is a person who has a good reputation for growing plants and flowers. One with a green thumb will generally have success with plant growth. \nIn other words, having a \"green thumb\" implies one has a talent for growing plants or a knack for it. \nNow, we need to interpret the options in the context of the whole phrase. \nOption A: Yellow - This is not a good color, or type of thumb, for plants. We can eliminate it as a potentially correct answer. \nOption B: Pinky - This is an odd choice that is not used to refer to a color or type of thumb. We can eliminate it. \nOption C: Purple - Even though purple is a beautiful color, it doesn't convey what we're looking for in this context. \nOption D: Rusty - Again, this is not a good color or type of thumb for a green thumb and also doesn't convey the appropriate meaning. \nOption E: Brown - This is a common color, or type of color, of a thumb. However, the focus is not on the color of the thumbs as much as on the ability to grow plants and flowers successfully. Therefore, the best option is E: Brown\nAnswer: E: Brown\n \n\n### Bonus Question:\n\nInput: At the end of the day the person will be tired, what is going to be their body language? Choices: \tA. Open B. Closed C. Curious D. Confused E. Sleepy\nRationales: We start by understanding what the question is asking, as understanding the body language of someone indicates a specific state of mind or personality.\nWe can interpret each of the options one by one:\nOption A: Open. An open body language is typically used to indicate friendliness or a warm, approachable demeanor. This is not a good choice for this sentence as no information is provided, and it's not associated with people who are \"tired.\" It would best match up with an active", "answer": " 41"}

Choices:  A; didn't bury it\nB; didn't grow it\nC; didn't take care of it\nD; didn't have good intentions\nE; didn't plant anything\nRationales: The sentence is asking us to find the misstep the character took in the planting.\n1. A; didn't buried it. As mentioned before \"buried\" is a strong action verb that can relate to digging or burying of something.\n2. B; didn't grow anything. Doesn't seem like a proper misstep when it is not related to gardening.\n3. C; Didn't take care of anything implies that she was taking care of something. As we know she didn't had a green thumb as she was not caring for it.\n4. D; good intentions isn't the proper fit. As the phrase says \"she sure didn't had a *green* thumb\".\n5. E; Didn't plant anything isn't relevant to the question.\n6. The answer is D: didn't had good intentions because it perfectly fits the context of the question where she had no green thumb or good intentions for the planting.\nAnswer: D; didn't had good intention\n\nInput: What did the teacher do to the students that made them cry?

A: crabgras killer helps get the weeds away so the plants don't suffer/shrivel, but it's also not going to make the plants grow\n7.

Choices:  *A: windy\n*B: wet\n*C: dry\n*D: freezing\n*E: rainy\nRationales: Since we are looking at the answer choice that can explain the reason for canceling the hike, we have to pay attention to the context. The condition (as stated) and the answers:\n1. One might say that the weather was _____ for the hike to take place.\n2. Since the context provided does not specify if it's the weather that was canceling the hike or the hikers, I have chosen to assume that it's the weather.\n3. Answer choice A is not correct as the weather in question here is \"windy\". Rain or rain combined with wind is more likely to result in cancelled hiking activity than wind alone.\n4. Answer choice E is also not correct as it isn't a synonym of \"windy\"; even if there was a lot of precipitation to go along with the wind, we aren't likely to cancel our hiking plans because of a few rain drops.\n5. Answer choice C is very likely going to be correct because \"too dry\", depending on the region and current conditions, can be another synonym of \"windier than usual\" (windier than our planned hike), which is the first part of the prompt.\n6", "answer": " 38"}
{"text": "might grow flowers, the plant fell over. What could be the problem? Choices: A: climate B: soil C: nutrition D: water E: sunlight\nRationales: The question asks what could be the problem that prevented her from growing flowers. \nThe context of this question implies that the problem is causing the plant to fall over. There are several steps to solving this: \n1. Understand the key language: She didn\u2019t have a green thumb. This phrase means she was not adept at gardening. \n2. Consider each choice carefully.\n3. A: climate. The climate refers to the climate in which plants are typically grown. Planting a flower in the wrong climate can cause it to die. However, the problem with the plant in this scenario is that it is being planted at all. Also, the problem of poor climate would likely result in the plant being dried up, brown, or dead, rather than simply being overturned. \n4. B: soil. This doesn\u2019t seem right as the soil in the scenario of dying flowers is not mentioned in the question. Instead, it focuses on the failure to grow flowers. \n5. C: nutrition. Poor nutrition is a common cause of plant malnourishment and death, but it does not affect flowers directly. \n6. D: water. Although not an entirely inaccurate answer, it\u2019s incorrect as the climate of the area does not mention droughts, and the phrase dying flowers implies that these plants are not being well-taken care of. They aren\u2019t thirsty because they are dying. \n7. E: sunlight. Sunlight is not a problem for these plants, unless the climate of the area is constantly under cloud-cover. However, there is no indication that this is the case, and the scenario of dying flowers implies the opposite.\n8. Therefore the best answer is E: Sunlight. The answer is Sunlight - the choice that accurately captures the language in the question, the context of the situation given, and the actual problem being discussed.\nAnswer: E = Sunlight\n\nInput: Where in a library, an individual might search for?

{"text": "had the garden ready she just forgot to water it. Which is wrong? Choices: 1. The garden never seemed to watered.\n2. She was too busy to take care of the garden.\n3. Nothing seemed to survive.\n4. It was too dry to water.\n5. She decided to plant more vegetables and fruits.\nRationales: The problem here is that the question is asking  which of the two answers is wrong. Therefore, the answer to this problem doesn't necessarily need to pick the wrong answer, but the answer that fits the most and works logically with the question.\nThe first answer (1. The garden never seem to watered.) doesn't fit as well as the other answers because it is not really part of the narrative and therefore not directly related to a garden not being cared for. The second answer (she was too busy to take are of the garden) fits in well with the idea that gardens need water and if there is no water, of course, they will not be able to grow. The other options (nothing seemed to survive. It was too dry) are closely related to this specific problem with lack of water, so they fit in with the narrative better. The last option (She decided to plant more vegetable and fruits) is something that is directly related to her forgetting to water the garden and therefore is more likely to lead to its demise. Given this, the best answer to this question is the second answer, he was too busy to take ar of the garden.\nAnswer: she was too busy to take of the garden.\n\nInput: Dad, you haven't paid child support in 2 years.

The defendant will be asked to pay twice as much as he hasn't paid over two years. He is expected to be able to return this twice the amount twice as long into the future.\nThe first two years into the future and the last five years are both the most logical.

{"text": "was a professional planter what did she actually do? Choices: \n A: put plant in soil\n B: grow plants\n C: place plant near light\n D: take plant home\n E: place new plant near old plant\nRationales: The phrase \"every time she thought\" implies that the person may have unrealistic expectations about what they can do, and not be able to achieve professional results. \nA: Put plant in soil. This is not relevant as the phrase \"put plant in soil\" does not help the person be a professional planter. It's important also to note that the person may not even be interested in gardening or growing plants. They may only want to improve their skills.\n\nB: Grow plants. Growing plants is something that takes time and effort, which the phrase \"every time\" suggests the person may not have the necessary skills or qualifications to do.\n\nC: Place plant near light. This may be part of a successful technique for growing plants, but it's a small part, and other factors are also important for success.\n\nD: Take plant home. This is not relevant because the sentence does not suggest taking the plant home is necessary for planting it.\n\nE: Place new plant near old plant. This is a common practice in gardening and agriculture, but it's only one method, and not necessarily the only or best way to plant new plants.\n\nThe best answer is B: grow plants.

Choice A is also not a fun activity. Choice D is a good date idea but is not necessarily a specific activity that is fun.

The key takeaway is that someone is unable to grow plants, likely due to a lack of gardening knowledge or skills.\nNext, consider each option in turn.\nOption A: blue. This seems like a plausible choice, but we cannot rule out any color until considering all the other answers. It is not unusual for a non-gardener to lack knowledge in this area, resulting in them trying out various gardening techniques and perhaps using the wrong colors.\nOption B: black. The phrase \"when she thought she was going\" indicates that this person's color thinking is likely not very good or accurate. This answer seems like it may have been the original intention, but they actually may not have any knowledge of the proper coloring.\nOption C: gray.\nOption D: purple. This could be a reasonable answer, as purple is traditionally associated with gardening in art and literature.\nOption E: Orange.  This could fit, as orange is often used in gardens and landscaping in combination with other colors, including black and purple. Alternatively, it could be referring to someone with extremely good gardening skills who happens to be of color orange.\nAfter considering all the options in turn, the best fit appears to be D: purple.\nOption A:  BLUE IS OUT  Purple is still not out, but it's unlikely to be the correct color. \nOption B:  BLACK IS OUT  Blue is still not out. \nOption C:  GRAY is out  Blue is still not eliminated in the same way it isn't eliminated by Black \nOption D:  PURPLE is OUT  Gray is no longer the correct answer. \nOption E:  ORANGE is out  Even when you add gray to purple Orange is still your top pick. \nOption A:  Blue is still not a good pick. \nOption B and C: Gray and purple are out. \nOption D: ORANGE IS THE ANSWER \nAnswer: Orange", "answer": " 476"}
{"text": "was doing a good job it would? Choices: 1: grow healthy 2: grow bigger 3: grow well 4: grow well 5: shrink 6: worsen\nRationales: First, identify the goal of the person, who presumably wants a green thumb. She is not doing a good job and everything she tries doesn't seem to work.\n1. \"Grow healthy\" is not an indication of whether the person doing the trying has a green thumb.\n2. \"Grow bigger\" is not related to the job or the person's efforts.\n3. The phrase \"thought she was doing a good\" indicates that she was, at least part of her, trying hard. \"It\" appears to be a way of referring to the person.\n4. \"Grow well\" could be related to the green thumb, but it could also mean growing well in general. \"Grow well, it shrinks\", would make perfect sense, but \"grow it well\" wouldn't.\n5. \"Shrink\" refers to the green thumb, so it's out.\n6. Now, we consider \"worsen\" and we can eliminate it. Gaining doesn't worsen something, so it would always be the opposite of a worsening. \"It doesn't worsens\", would make sense, but \"It worsens well\" doesn't.\n7. \"Grow healthier\" is a common way of saying \"grow better\" and it's also plausible that she was trying to grow a healthy green thumb.\n8. Finally, \"grow healthier\" is an excellent answer, as it was the best plausible meaning from each answer except \"grow better\", which is the true answer.\nAnswer: F: grow healthier - it's the most plausible meaning from the answer choices.\n\nInput: How do you remove oranges?

{"text": "water the plant, the plants would dry up. Choices:  A. Green thumb B. Fertilizer C. Seeds D. Flowers E. Sunlight\nRationales: The phrase \"every time she watered her plants\" implies a consistent pattern in which the plants were always dry. This suggests that the watering method is not the likely cause, meaning that a green thumb can result from other factors, not just watering knowledge. \nNext, we look at if the phrase \"the plants would dry up,\" is used in a specific context or sense. \nIf it was, we could consider \"flowers\" as a possible answer, as it would make sense to compare the flower of a plant with a person. However, it does not make much sense to refer to a plant's flower as a \"green thumb\" or as a trait possessed by someone \"with a green thumb\". \nAnother option may be to refer the plant flowering as a natural process, perhaps a cycle for the plant. In which case, we can exclude \"flowers\" as an answer, since the phrase \"the plants were always dry\" directly refers to water, indicating that the plants were not in a cycle. \nThe remaining options are \"green thumb\", \"seeds\", \"fertilizer\", and \"sunlight.\" \nIt may seem odd that these options contain elements that refer to the plant, but the context in which \"green thumb\" is referred to, is not about the plant itself. The reference is used as a comparative, therefore \"Fertilizer\" and \"sunlight\" cannot be used as possible answers. \nThis leaves \"fertilizer\" as the probable answer. \nFertilizer can refer to a food for plants, making it the most applicable. The phrase \"green thumb\" implies that it contains nutrients which contribute to the plant's growth. \nAnswer: A: green thumb\n\n## Resources\n### Videos\n[English Language and Composition - Writing - Task 1 - Strong Paragraphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_w4BZFuFvg)\n[English Class 12 Ssc - E.L.C (TASK 1) - Strong Paragraph](https://www.youth4work.com/Career-Skill-Training-Live-Webinar-", "answer": " 5"}

E: planting the wrong things\nRationales: The answer choice can either be a different type of vegetable, or something unrelated. For example, if she thought she was plant green onion, but was planting white, that would make me think she wouldn't be able to distinguish between a green onion and a white onion.

First understand the question. Her thumb is bad for the plant indicates that her bad tendency to water the plant was causing damage. \n2. Next, interpret the answer options. Each choice should be based on the specific context and meaning of the term \"green thumb\" as defined in the preceding paragraph. \n3. All of the choices contain technical information about the process of watering a plant. \n4. Option A: Too much water can be bad but that's not what we're focusing on here.\n5. Option B: Watering too much will dry the plant, but that's not the issue in this context.\n6. Option C: Watering too frequently - This seems to be related to frequent watering, not too much watering. \n7. Option D: She was trying to apply regular watering, and her attempt was unsuccessful. \n8. Option E: It was not enough water so she watered plant - The sentence does not explain this.

The text states that she had a green thumb or a black thumb, implying whether her plans for the plant will result in black thumb or green thumb. So, the answers must be related to whether the plant will do well or not.\n\n1. Now consider the options:\n2. \"Die\" is not a common term for plant health to either thrive or wither.\n3. \"Thrive\" means a plant does well, while \"withering\" means the plant suffers or does badly. Thus, B: thrive and C: wither are most likely answer choices, but C is more likely to be the correct answer as it is the opposite of \"green thumb.\"\n4.

The friend needs a break to talk to the person who is sitting at the table. 2. To share how the friend feels. 3. To tell why the friend can't talk directly to the person at the table. 4. To tell a funny story that only the person at the table would enjoy. 5.\nRationales: In this sample question, you are asked if you have been invited to sit at the table in your friend's house.\n\n1. The friend is clearly aware of the person at the table, therefore, 1 is incorrect\n2. The table would be the common place for two people to converse and talk to each other privately, so 3 is redundant.\n3. If the friend needs to tell you to talk to the person at the house, 4 is the correct answer\n4. Finally, 5 is irrelevant; if you were to tell the person at another table a funny story, you would be sharing it with only that person, not your friend.\n\nAnswer: 4", "answer": " 840"}

Choices: 1) The seeds didn't pop up. 2) It suddenly rained. 3) The birds and snakes ate everything. 4) The caterpillars devoured everything. 5) I'll let you finish it\nRationales: Consider each option:\n1. Seeds not popping up (Option 1) does not explain why there was no great outcome, but it implies the process of planting went well.\n2. Rain (Option 2) may have been a factor in why the garden wasn't doing well, but it would not have impacted the first planting process.\n3. Animals (Option 3) might have had a negative impact on the garden, but it's unclear if the person attempted to plant anything before this happened.\n4.

{"text": "had a green thumb she cut them down. Choices:  A. tree B. rose C. cactus D. weed E. flower\nRationales: Let's start with understanding the context of what is being said. The statement, \"She sure didn't have the green thumb\" means that she had difficulty becoming successful or successful at a particular skill or job. In this case, the skill is gardening.\nThe term \"green thumb\" is an old idiom that refers to having a natural ability to grow and maintain plants. The phrase \"cut them down\" implies that she had tried and failed to grow plants, probably multiple times.\nNow, based on the context and the choices, A. Tree, B. Rose, C. cactus, D. weed, E. flower is the best answer.\nA. tree is an option, however, due to the idiomatic nature of the phrase green thumb, it is not relevant and not the correct answer choice.\nB flower is not the best choice because the statement about the green thumb refers to gardening, which would require different growth patterns than a flower.\nC, Cactus and D weed, the context of this idiom refers to gardening, and a cactus does not typically fall into that category. This choice is eliminated.\nHowever, in this case, D. weed is the best choice because the phrase green thumb means having a natural ability to garden plants, and a weed could be considered any plant that grows in areas it is not supposed to.\nAnswer: D. Weed\n\nInput: The book has an author's name, and title, plus the information on who is in love with that author. Choices: 1. Peter 2. Luna 3. Ron 4. Harry 5. Cho 6. Voldemort 7. Severus 8.

{"text": "would plant green plant, it died, where did she plant? Choices: \tA: pot B: shelf C: window D: sink E: vase\nRationales : This is a tricky question, here's how I solved it. The goal is to determine where the plant was planted if it has a poor growth rate.\n1. Option A: pot  \u2013  The description of the choice suggests that a pot is the best option to plant green.\n2. Option B: shelf  \u2013  Nothing in the description suggests the shelf was used to grow plants.\n3. Option C: window \u2013  This could be an option, as a window can act as a small garden or container to plant herbs and flowers.\n4. Option D: sink \u2013  A sink would not be used to grow plants for the same reasons a shelf wouldn\u2019t since it isn\u2019t suitable for the plant\u2019s needs. \n5. Option E: Vase \u2013  Just like a pot, a vase would be best suited.\nAnswer: E  :  Vase\n\nInput: What are you saying if I say you should say your piece? Choices: A: give a speech B: make an argument C: do something D: give your thoughts E: make a presentation\nRationales : The sentence is asking if we should say a certain thing. A speech is something a person can make. A piece and speech have some different implications, but it comes down to if a presenter would call it a speech or a piece, as we don't know the context.\n2. An argument follows from presenting one side of an instance. Therefore, A: give a speech is the best option.  \n3. A Presentation is something we would see in a business or academic setting.\n4. A speech can be considered a presentation.\n5. A presentation can be considered a speech if the audience is present.\n6. The audience is omitted due to the question itself being in a hypothetical and not a hypothetical. Therefore, C: do something is the best option.\n7. A piece and a speech are the same thing, with a piece being more informal. The hypothetical we have is not formal, so it's best to say E: Make a presentation, as there is no need to go through a piece and a speech.\nAnswer: E :", "answer": " 90"}
{"text": "kept that plant alive, it would die Choices:  A. it would grow on the counter B. it had a fungus C. the roots didn't have drainage D. the plant had a pest infestation E. her apartment leaked water\nRationales: To understand this, you'll need to understand why your plant died and the right way to care for it.\n1. Option A (it would grow on the counter), it doesn\u2019t matter where the plant goes, if it doesn\u2019t have enough sunlight it\u2019s going to die whether it\u2019s on a windowsill or counter.\n2. Option B (it had a fungus) - The plant died because it lacked moisture. The plant needed to be watered more frequently. This is not the case, option C (the roots didn\u2019t have drainage) \u2013 The solution here is to make sure the plant has proper drainage when watering it \u2013 either it has a pot with drainage holes in the bottom or you make sure there\u2019s always drainage materials like rocks, broken clay pots, or something similar to keep the soil from making a dam after adding water, and then allow the excess water to drain away.\n3. Option C (the plant had a pest problem), the plant will die if you don\u2019t treat the pest problem, and the quickest way is to find one type of pest (they could be spiders, ants or aphids) and get rid of that one kind for the plant to survive. This is probably not the answer. Plants will die if you don't put them in a place they like, the air is too dry, or there is not enough food or water. Also, no one likes a friend that's not always there for them.\n4. Option D (it had an infestation) \u2013 If you don\u2019t get rid of the pest problem, every time you water the soil they will eat whatever you put in the soil, they will then leave babies in that soil, and they will also start eating every other part that grows.

{"text": "had a new seed and plant, it would _______. Choices:  A. Die B. Die C. Die D. Die E. Die\nRationales: First, we must understand the question to decide what the correct answer might be. \n1. The question implies that the choice must be a word that describes what happens to things the character attempts to grow.\n2. \"Die\" is the only choice that describes what exactly happens in the question's reference to seed and plants.\n3. So, the answer is A. Die.\nAnswer: A. Die\n\nInput: Why doesn't she write to me anymore, doesn't that girl understand friendship? Choices: 1. A: I'm the only one who writes to her B: we'll never be friends again C: she will probably write soon D: she'll be friends with someone else later\nRationales: Now, we can examine the answer choices to find the one that best matches the situation described in the question.\n1. Consider all the possible options that could be applied to the sentence: A: I'm The only one who writes to Her.\n2. The sentence states that The first doesn't write to you, or doesn't write to The anymore, but it doesn't specifically state that the last one doesn't write to her anymore. So, this isn't the correct choice.\n3. Next, let's take a look at C: We'll Never Be Friends Again. Again, it doesn't fit the fact that the last statement reads \"friendship\". So, C is also not the answer.\n4. D: she will probably write Soon fits the fact pattern of the question, namely that the last statement doesn't write to the person any longer. We can't rule out that she will start writing to the person again, but at the current moment, she doesn't.\n5. Lastly let's investigate E: She Will Be Friends With Someone Else Later. This answer is also plausible, as the last statement doesn' t write to The anymore, and the phrase suggests that she might start sending letters to someone else.\n6. However, the correct answer is still D: She will probably write Soon; this is a fitting answer as the last word doesn't write to me anymore, yet she didn't write a response to the", "answer": " 1825"}
{"text": "was getting it, it grew into something else, how? Choices: 1. A: water, 2. B: weed, 3. C: herb, 4. D: moss, 5. E: grassy\nRationales:\n1. To start off, understand the question and the words used. Every time the phrase \"get it in,\" is used, it's referring to growing a plant.\n2. Now, use context clues to understand what would happen when a green thumb grows something in every time they thought they were growing something else\n3. After understanding how she couldn't get a green thumb, check the options and start eliminating the ones that don't fit\n4. Water (option A) can be a problem for a green thumb - growing the wrong plant in the wrong place can lead to problems such as mold or overwatering. However, \"getting it\" in a green thumb is to grow something. Water (A) can only be useful if it's applied in the proper way during the right time.\n5. Weeding (B) is related to trying to remove unwanted plants, not growing plants. So, we can eliminate option B\n6. Herbs (C) can be a problem\n7. Moss (D) can also be a problem. So, we can further eliminate options B and D\n8. Finally, checking a green thumb to see if it can grow in something requires knowledge of what that subject is. Check the options and see which ones apply and which options are correct\n9. Since moss and grass are both growing subjects, the most likely options are going to be something that relates to it - Option (E): grassy.\n10. Choices C, D, and E are the only ones that remain so consider them carefully.\n11. We know that there was something to do with grass and plants, so we can eliminate D: moss. This leaves us with two possible answers (E: grassy) and option C: herb.\n12. Now, examine C: herb and E: grassy to determine which one would be the best answer\n13. We want to choose the option that most closely matches herb or grassy. The most common definition of a herb is a plant that grows in one's home used for cooking purposes. \n14.

{"text": "was trying to grow a flower, the plants would die. Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales:\n1. The question asks what the person is unable to do. Reading the question carefully reveals that this individual does not have a green thumb.\n2. The choice options provide examples of the people's attempts to grow a flower.\n3. They include A: plant it in the wrong place, B: plant it in the proper soil, C: water and fertilize correctly, D: provide sunlight, and E: provide fresh soil.\n4. Choice A: the wrong place. It's a possibility that the person is gardening in a place that receives poor lighting or has unsuitable soil, which could lead to the death of the plant. This makes sense as a potential explanation for the person's inability to keep plants alive.\n5. Choice B: proper soil. The individual might still be growing healthy, blooming flowers if they were using soil appropriate for their chosen type of plant.\n6. Choice C: water and fertize correctly. Proper watering and fertilization could help to improve and maintain the health of a plant.\n7. Choice D: sunlight. Plants need sunlight, so the individual should make sure that their plant is getting enough.\n8. Choice E: provide fresh soil is unlikely to be the right answer because it implies that the person provides new soil for their plants frequently. This would likely cause confusion and conflict with the soil. \n9. Therefore, since choosing only one of the options would be limiting, we need to look at the two remaining options that provide explanations and could be the answer.\n10. The person may have been trying to grow the flowers, which is indicated by choice D: provide sunlight and choice B: properly plant the flower in the soil. \n11. If this individual was trying to provide sunlight for their plants, this could explain why they were unable to keep the plants alive for long periods of time.\n12. Also, if their soil was not appropriate for the chosen type of plant, this could explain why the plants died.\n13. Therefore, our choices are D: the person was trying to grow something in the flowers, and B: they were using soil inappropriate for the plants.\n14.

{"text": "watered she what? Choices:  Wetting the soil, kilt, or wet her pants A: killed the plant B: watered the tree C: water the ground D: drank the water E: had a bad day\nRationales: The first step is to determine what the question is asking: \n1. A, wetting the soil does not water any plants.\n2. B, watermark the tree, is a bit of a confusing verb. However, when combined with kill the plant, the full sentence makes more sense. So, B is probably not the intended answer.\n3. C, water the ground makes us think of watering the soil on a farm but it doesn't answer the question so it too can be eliminated. \n4. D, drink the water is a possibility but not a plant killer.\n5. E, havea bad day, simply states that she had a bad day and does not answer the question so not the correct answer. \nNow, let's look at the choices that remain:\n1. A, killed the plant is incorrect because we know it's not possible to wet the soil without watering something, killing it or not.\n2. The correct answer is B: watered the plant.\nAnswer: B : watered the plant\n\nInput: What does baker use to make their bread? Choices:  Baking sheets, ovens, or mixers A: pans B: stains C: baking tins D: bowls E: knives\nRationales: First, identify the key points of the sentence.\n1. The question asks what bakers use to make bread. \n2. The phrase \"baking bread\" refers to the process of making bread by applying heat to dough through baking in an oven.\n3. The choice of words \"make their bread\" implies that the bread being baked isn't for sale but rather being baked by \"theirself\".\n4. So, answer options A, B, C, and E can be eliminated because the phrase \"their bread\" implies it is being baked by the baker for themselves and not for sale. \n5. Answer options D and B describe equipment that can be used by bakers to prepare various items but not in the context of baking bread. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B:", "answer": " 96"}

{"text": "was saving the apple tree, how could he tell if she made it? Choices: 1: cut 2: bark 3: fruit 4: blossom 5: leaves 6: root\nRationales: First, understand the question by breaking it down into its various parts. \"She sure didn't have\" means that she has an inability to. \"Green thumb\" refers to the ability to grow plants healthily. The rest of the statement, \"every time she thought she was,\" implies intent or attempts to make things better. We can conclude that she may have been trying to make her apple tree better, but didn't have the correct skills. \nNext, look over the answer choices, focusing primarily on verbs, which are used in a different context to answer the question. Verbs are the \"action words\" of a sentence, and describe what a person, animal, or thing does or can do. \nChoice 1: \"cut\" is appropriate as a verb, but isn't directly related to the ability to grow. \nChoice 3 is \"fruit\" which can be used as a noun, it might be better as an answer choice if it were in a different form. \nChoice 5: \"leaves,\" as a noun, but it describes a part of the plant, rather than an action. \nChoice 2: \"bark\" can be used as an adjective or a noun, so we can't determine what's more appropriate in the given context. It might work as a verb if the sentence were reworded.\nChoice 4: \"blossom\" is primarily an adjective, not directly related to the question. \nChoice 6: \"root,\" as a verb, is used to describe an action, so it may fit as an answer choice.\n\nBased on this information, the two best answer choices that remain for our answer are \"1: cut\" and \"6: root\", but we're aiming for one answer and it's possible that one of the unselected choices could be the most suitable for the question. \n\nTo determine the final answer, we can reword the sentence, \"every time she tried to save the apple tree\" so that leaves is used as a verb, since it is an action word.\n\nSince 'cut' as a verb is also an action, we", "answer": " 21"}

The choices have to indicate what is likely to be the road where one goes to get produce.\nOption A: market (choice D). This term is commonly used to describe places where food and produce are sold. This answer can be eliminated as it fits the context more than the other choices and makes the most sense in terms of the question.\nOption B: hardware store (choice E). This does not make sense to be the right road where produce is sold, and does not indicate a place where produce is likely to be sold.\nOption C: grocer (choice F). This is a term that refers to shops and establishments selling food and produce. This makes more sense to be the road where produce is available, and it does not contradict choice D(market) too much. \nTherefore, the best answer is choice C, grocer.\nAnswer: C) grocer\n\nInput: Which of the following can be a type of chocolate?

Mending the curtains can refer to patching or fixing something, as well as adjusting a seam or length. This choice is suitable.\n5.

{"text": "was doing her best. Choices:  A green tree B punch in the face C purple house D an eye twitch E green grass\nRationales: The given statement is ambiguous as it doesn\u2019t specify if we're talking about \u201ca green thumb\u201d or \u201cher best\u201d. When we refer to \u201cher best\u201d, green is not the logical color choice as a thumb is typically on a hand, not a face. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A (green tree), B (punch in the face), D (an eye twitch), and E (green grass).\nNow let's try to evaluate the meaning of the color choice if the statement refers to \u201ca green thumb\u201d. We know that plants need sunlight and warmth to properly thrive and grow. Green is, therefore, an appropriate color choice if an answer choice refers to adequate sunlight. This could also be an allusion to grass, which would be considered \u201cgreen\u201d. Thus, we can eliminate choices B and D (punch in the eye, purple house).\nNext, we evaluate choice C (A punch in the face). A punch in the face could be considered a warning sign of a person's potential violence. Green might, then, be an appropriate color choice to indicate that the person is not safe to be around. Nevertheless, another meaning of green refers to money and wealth. Therefore, we can remove this color from our list and proceed with C and D.\nThe last possibility remaining is D (an eye twist). An eye twist is indicative of anger, and anger is a feeling that often correlates with green. Therefore, this statement might be referring to a person's green eyes. It is also an allusion to jealousy. According to the Urban Dictionary, it is another term to describe a person with green skin. Therefore, we cannot eliminate this choice.\nNow let\u2019s go through each choice to evaluate the best option. It seems like a purple house would most likely be considered a home, and \u201chome\u201d would not be a word typically related to a thumb. The same goes for a punch in the eye: it's an unexpected thing to expect in a thumb. It doesn't describe how it is related to the thumb. Furthermore, we do not associate eye twitch and grass, nor grass with \"best', not even green's connotation with grass. Therefore, our best option is the correct", "answer": " 148"}

It means someone is especially talented when it comes to caring for plants and flowers.\n\nA: dried flowers. This choice would be correct if it were about plants that have already dried. Dried flowers can\u2019t grow and rot in the same plant because they are already dried. However, they don\u2019t always start to rot.\n\nB: seeds. This choice refers to growing new plants from seeds. However, in the case of the question, no plants were growing from seeds, so the correct answer is not seeds.\n\nC: Brownies. Cookies with chocolate are not plants, so this option is not correct either.\n\nD: Plants.

The question doesn't indicate that the person has the ability, simply that she doesn't.\n3. Of the answer options, every one is a type of plant.

{"text": "has what? Choices: 1. A: enough water 2. B: a plant C: fertilizer 3. D: shade E: sun 4. F: seeds\nRationales:\n1. First, understand exactly what \"She sure didn't have\n   a green thumb\" means in this case. A \"green thumb\" is a person born with a skill or talent for caring and maintaining plants. It's a term related to gardening and plant care.\n\n2. Eliminate the obviously incorrect options: A: enough water. Watering a plant with enough water is crucial for its survival. But, if the plant isn't green in the first place, then providing it with enough water won't help the plant survive.\n3. Eliminate B: a plant. She certainly didn't do anything with a plant. She could very well have killed the plants she was trying to care for.\n4. Eliminate C: fertilizer. Fertilizer provides nutrients to the soil, improving the plant's health. But, if She wasn't able to keep her plants green, then fertilizer wouldn't help.\n5. Eliminate D: shade. Shade provides protection from intense sunlight, which can cause damage to the plant. But if a person can't keep her plants green, providing them with shade is a moot point.\n6. Eliminate E: sun. More commonly, people provide plants with sunlight, which helps them grow and thrive. But, if someone can't keep her own plants green, providing them from the sun wouldn't help. \n\n7. The answer can now be found easily. Remember the original meaning of the phrase \"She sure didn' think she has what.\" It refers to the lack of skills, talents, or abilities to care for and maintain plants. The answer is C: fertilizer, because the phrase \"She sure could not keep her\" refers to the inability to provide the necessary care for the plants to grow and thrive. So, if she couldn't keep her plants healthy and green, and fertilizer would help, then  the best answer is C: fertile soil.\n\nAnswer: C: fertilizer\n\nInput: Where does an avenger be?

{"text": "knew what she was doing she messed it up like they had been doing. Choices:  A green thumb B ate the plants C tried growing plants D knew that the plants got messed up E tried to help out\nRationales: The question asks us to understand the problematic behavior of the previous gardener, which could be identified by the phrase \"she messed it up\". This suggests that the gardener was somehow causing problems or damaging plants, indicating that we're looking for something or someone that would be causing damage to the plant.\n\nNow, let's consider each possible answer and see which one fits:\n\n1.Option A: Green thumb - This doesn't seem related to the problem with the plants. A green thumb is a term used to describe a gardener with good gardening skills; it doesn't necessarily imply damaging the plants.\n2.Option B: Ate the plants - This could be a situation where the gardener was trying to eat the plants, but it doesn't seem to align with the situation where she \"messes it up\" and it's unlikely that she would eat the plants that got messed up.\n3.Option C: Tried growing the plants - This doesn't appear to be a problematic behavior in relation to the previous gardener, as the previous gardener clearly wasn't growing plants, and trying to grow them wouldn't cause damage to them.\n4.Option D: Knew that the plants got messy - While this could be a problematic behavior if it implies that the gardener knew the plants were going to be damaged by her actions, the previous gardener was causing problems with the plants, not intending to damage them, which was the case.\n5.Option E: Tried to help - This doesn't directly address the issue of the plants getting damaged, so it doesn't seem like it would fit here.\n\nThe answer can be found by checking each option, finding the one that fits the criteria and doesn't have any issues with the sentence. Option E: tried to help, fits the criteria and does not have any flaws with the sentence, so it is the correct answer.", "answer": " 295"}

Brown could be an outcome of these factors, but it is not related to thinking about plants. \n\nD: purple. This could be the result of the same factors that influence the plant to be brown. \n\nE: no difference.

This makes it easier for them to avoid emotional ties and maintain a calm and objective demeanor.

The sentence talks about how she had tried every method but had not gotten any results. This suggests that her previous attempts at growing things resulted in a failure instead of success. So, the correct answers will likely be those that represent failures rather than success.\nConsider the options in the list:\nA: moss - moss is supposed to grow everywhere, even where there are no plants. It's a part of a natural ecosystem. So, we can easily rule this one out right away.\nB: sticks - These can't be leaves, since leaves are the part of a plant that is green and makes up the plant's color. So, this option can be eliminated too.\nC: branches - These, too, can't be leaves since they're a part of a plant and grow to be longer and thicker than leaves.\nD: pine needles - the needles from any pine tree are green, so this can't be an appropriate answer.

As a follow-up question, it is crucial to analyze each alternative carefully. \nStep 1: The phrase \"She sure didn't have...\" connotes to a negative opinion of the selected person, in this case, the gardener. \nStep 2 : Now, we can analyze \"green thumb\". \nStep 3 : We know we're dealing with a negative opinion, so we need to be cautious while looking for any positive aspects linked to the subject. \nStep 5 : We have eliminated choice A, a choice that, at a glimpse, seems to be an out of the box suggestion, but in fact it is not. This choice, while sounding good and positive, is not related to the specified facts of the question, since the gardener in fact didn't have a \"green thumb\" and as a matter of fact, didn't show any good growing results with her flowers.\nStep 6 : We can conclude that the rest of the choices are correct. \nStep 7: Therefore, our best response is a combination of choice B and choice C, since they both indicate that the gardener had bad gardening results and lacked a green thumb for flowers\nAnswer: B: A garden and C: gardening\n\nInput: What does the letter \"P\" mean?

{"text": "did? Choices: \u2610: Yes  A: No B: Sometimes  C: Yep D: All the time E: Yes if my wife was watching\nRationales: The answer starts with understanding how to interpret this statement. It's the idea that someone is describing someone else in terms of their success or failure. \nThe question asks us to consider how the speaker might feel about their lack of success at gardening. Let's consider each option one by one:\n1. Option A: \"No\" means the person is not willing to say that they had a lack of success at garden.\n2. Option B: \"Sometimes\" could mean that the person had some success in the past or would have some success in the future, making it less likely that they feel a lack of success in this endeavor.\n3. Option C: \"Yep\" is an informal and casual way of saying \"yes,\" which may suggest that the person does not feel a lack of success.\n4. Option D: \"All the time\" suggests a consistent level of success, which would be unlikely in a situation where the person didn't feel successful in the past.\n5. Option E: \"My wife was watching\" doesn't relate to the question at all.\n6. \"Yep\" means \"yes\" in a casual or informal manner, so this option is not the answer since it doesn't indicate that the person has a lack of success. The next-best option is D: \"All the times\" since it indicates that the person is having a consistent level of success.\n7. Option B: \"sometimes\" indicates that the person has had varied success throughout the time, making it unlikely that the person would feel a lack of success consistently.\n8. Option D: \"all these years\" suggests that the person has had no consistent level of success over a long period of time. Therefore, D: \"All these years\" is the correct answer. \n9. A: \"no\" means the person isn't willing to admit a lack of success, making it less likely to be the answer.\n10. Option E: \"Yes if my wife was watching\" does not indicate that the person is saying they had a lack of gardening success, so this option is ruled out.\n11.

It is a metaphor that indicates someone is planting new things and making them successful.\n1. A: destroy (too strong of an action) 2. B: kill (too strong of a physical action) 3. C: make new problems (not necessary when trying to make things successful) 4. D: start new (life or growth) 5.

{"text": "was ready to learn, the teacher wasn't with her yet. Choices:  A green thumb B was able to do the trick C needed to keep on practicing D was able to get the grade E did the correct thing\nRationales: The sentence says: She didn't have a \"green thumb\", which means she's not a very good gardener. To understand the context and meaning of this, we need to consider the choices carefully to identify which choice is the most appropriate.\n1. The first thing we check is whether there's a need for a noun, which in this case there doesn't seem to be.\n2. It doesn't help much in understanding what the sentence is asking, which should be \"what was the problem with her green thumb\". \n3. When checking each of the options, what becomes evident is that if there is a need to identify a noun, there are two choices that make the most sense, which are C \"keep on practicing\" which makes sense grammatically, and D \"did the correct thing\", which also makes sense and would fit the context of the sentence\n4. We remove the unhelpful choices E \"did the correct thing\" and A \"wasn't with her\" and then compare the remaining options:\n5. A green thumb: no noun required, but lacks a coherent meaning. While a \"green thumb\" can refer to having a special ability to grow plants, it does not make sense for a gardener not to have a green thumb. This has no relevance to why she didn't learn gardening.\n6. Need to keep on practicing: refers to having to practice something, which is not the reason the gardener didn't learn garden skills. This option can be removed from the choices.\n7. Did the correct thing: can be seen as an indirect explanation of the lack of gardening skills, however, it does not directly address the subject of this question. This can be eliminated.\n8. \"Was able to do the trick,\" can also be indirectly linked to lacking a green thumb, but more specifically speaking, \"was able to do the trick\" does not mean \"was able to make a plant grow\", it would instead mean \"was able to do something difficult and be successful\". This can be removed.\n9. We only have left \"C: was able to keep on practicing\" and", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "would grow them what she would get? Choices:  O: tomatoes, peppers, strawberries and raspberries  A: flowers  B: dandelions  C: roses  D: potatoes\nRationales: There are a few things to consider when solving this question.\n1. The question asks about what happens every time the person tried to grow them, so we need to focus on the actions of the person and the results.\n2. The person did grow some fruit and vegetables, which could be interpreted as a success, but not every time.\n3. So we can cross off \"every\" and \"time\".\n4. There are several options that could be interpreted as a failure of the person. For example, she might have tried to grow tomatoes, but ended up with dandelions. This could be a success if she intended to start raising dandelions.\n5. However, the person didn't grow anything, which indicates her efforts failed completely.\n6. So we can cross out \"she didn't have a single thing\" and \"her garden was filled with dirt\".\n7. Now what was left? Peppers, strawberriers, raspberries\u2026. And green thumbs (fruit/vegetable growing skills).\n8. Therefore, \"she sure didn't have\" would suggest that the person did grow some fruits and vegetables, and her garden was filled with the same.\n9. And finally we can see that the question asks \"She sure didn't have\u2026\". This indicates that the person did have something, but not a successful outcome and therefore did not have a green thumb.\n10. So the answer is O: tomatoes,\n peppers, straw- berries and rasp- berries.\n11. This is because although the person would grow these fruits and veggies, she would not be a green thumb.\n\nAnswer: O: tomatoes, \n peppers, \n straw- berries\n and rasp- ber-\nries", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": "had planted green beans actually planted what? Choices:  D: tomatoes  B: peppers  C: mushrooms  E: carrots\nRationales: In essence, the sentence implies that every time she planted what she thought were green beans, they actually turned out to be something different. This means that whenever she tries to plant something, she actually plants something else instead. It is important to understand the context of the sentence and the specific choices available as answers before deciding on what to answer. \n1. Green beans are known to be a type of vegetable, so B, C, and E cannot be the correct answer since this would mean that she planted a veggie instead.\n2. It's also necessary to consider what each option means. \n3. Choice A, 'dug her grave', indicates that something very harmful could have been planted instead, but it does not make sense for this to be something that is commonly referred to as green beans.\n4. Choice E, 'tomatoes', is a red vegetable and does not match the context of the sentence.\n5. Choice B, 'peppers', is a red vegetables, but does not make sense considering the context.\n6. Therefore, only option D, 'a different vegetable', makes sense, as it can be either green or red and still fit the context of the sentence, and the choices available. \n7.

{"text": "might water she would get another cut. Choices: A: get more water B: get a new plant C: use less water D: cut the plant E: let the plant die\nRationales: First, we need to understand the structure of the sentence. The sentence suggests that the person tried to give their plant more water, but this backfired, causing them to get cut.\n2. It's important not to take the word \"water\" literally but to think about the metaphoric meaning of it. \n3. \"Green Thumb\" is a metaphor for having natural skill at gardening, so this helps us narrow down the meaning of the sentence. \n4. The option that makes sense is B: get a new flower. This provides a logical conclusion to the person not having a green thumb and being hurt every time they tried to water their flower.\n5. E: let the plant dead makes sense as the person tried to water their plant in a way that made them think it was dying, indicating they either weren't paying attention to their plant's true state or were deliberately trying to kill it.\n6. \"Let the plant die\" is an expression meaning to not intervene or help the plant, allowing it to die.\n7. A: get more water is not necessarily a good answer, because the person might not have thought they were watering too much or too little - they just tried to make the plant grow, without knowing enough about how to do it.\n8. C: use less water could be a good answer, but since we're not sure how much water the person actually thought they needed, it's impossible to say if it's the correct answer. \n9. D: cut the plant is not a good answer because it's too literal and doesn't align with the overall logic of the sentence. Cutting a plant is not something someone would do to try to help the plant grow.\n10. Therefore, the correct option is B: get a plant. This makes sense as the sentence implies that the person tried to help the plant by giving it more water, only to end up getting hurt - so they tried again, but this time, getting something new for the plant.\nAnswer: B get plant\n\nInput: How is an organic apple different?

A: too cold 2: too much sun 3: too hot 4: not enough plant food 5: underwatered\nRationales: The sentence implies that her efforts failed, so we can expect the options to indicate the failure of an attempt to grow a plant or flower, rather than options that suggest success.\n1. A: too cool. This could be a potential answer, but too cold implies the conditions are below normal, which could be necessary for specific flowers.\n2. B: too much sun. Again, this could also be a possible answer but the term \"too much,\" refers to a level above what is required.\n3. C: too hot. This is another potential answer, but in this scenario, \"too hot\" indicates exceeding typical conditions that are necessary for growth.\n4. D: Not enough plant food. This option doesn't specifically say too little, but enough to support life.\n5. E: Underwatered. This is the correct option. Though the term \"underwatered\" means too little water, the phrase \"in their hands\" implies this is an intentional act, as if she would \"pick\" plants and underwater them.

A: flower bed\n\n- This can't be an answer, as there couldn't have been a question asked beforehand. It's not plausible that a person in that situation could have thought they were helping.\n\n3.

This refers to \"the next day they grew\", and if the soil condition wasn't good, then they wouldn't \"grow really well\".

Choices: A: flowers B: tomatoes C: mushrooms D: weeds E: herbs\nRationales: The phrase \"She sure didn't have\u2026\" indicates that the person in the sentence doesn't have a special talent for growing plants.\n1. Considering Choice A: Flowers, this is not surprising, as flowers can often be finicky and hard to grow. It's possible for a person to have a green thumb, but not necessarily for flowers.\n2. Choice B: Tomato, is a strange choice as tomatoes are a type of fruit and not a plant. It's also a plant that can easily thrive in different environments, and it's unlikely to wither away no matter what the person did.\n3. Moving on to Choice C: Mushrooms, this is an interesting choice as these plants can indeed be difficult to grow. However, it's not the answer we're looking for as the person was trying to grow plants, not mushrooms.\n4. Choice D: Weeds is an interesting choice as weeds, by definition, are hard to control. However, it' does not tell us anything about the person's ability to grow plants as it does not specifically refer to a plant.\n5.

The reader must come to a conclusion about why her plant died. \nWe can see that 2 options are clearly incorrect (C and A). \nFrom these two incorrect options we can determine that A) the weeds were dying and B) the temperature was too low. \nOption B is incorrect because 1) weeds cannot actually die when they grow in soil unless the ground is frozen - 2) weeds do not grow in soil as quickly as a plant that has seeds. \nOption A is also incorrect because a good gardener doesn't only grow plants with seeds but they also grow vegetables, herbs, and other seeds in the soil - 2) in a healthy garden, plants would be growing and you would have seeds or buds on weeds to show life.\nNext, I determined that Option D is incorrect because anyone can grow a plant or seeds if they follow the instructions and know what they are doing. \nLastly, option E is incorrect because the phrase \"all plants grow\" shows that she wasn't planting seeds, which would show she didn't care about her plants, like Option C.\n\nChoices A & B are incorrect. \n\nNext, I ruled out Option B.\n\nFinally, I ruled out Option C because only option E is grammatically correct, as it uses the word \"everyone\".\n\nAnswer: Only choice E is correct as it shows us why the plant died.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "had watered her plant enough, the next day it was withered. Choices:  A. did have B. didn't have C. won't have D. will have\nRationales: First, it is important to note that the expression \"green thumb\" refers to a person's ability to grow healthy, green plants. Choice A: did have indicates that the person in question had a green thumb and did have plants that did not wilt easily.\nThis choice is inconsistent with her having a green thumb since the plants typically thrive and stay hydrated. Additionally, choice C: won't have is incorrect because the phrase \"won't have\" suggests that the person won't ever have a green thumb since she doesn't currently have one.\n\n\n\n### Example:\nInput: Which of these are the closest to the earth? \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: The moon is on a far away planet, stars are in the sky and planets far away.\n\n### Rationales: \n- The moon is on our planet, so it is close to the earth.\n- Stars are in the sky and can also be viewed on earth during the night, so they would be considered close to the earth. \n- Planets would be considered close to one, such as close to the earth or sun since you would see them in the sky. \n\n### Answer:\n- The moon is close to the earth\n- Stars are in sky and close to earth\n\n### Example Question:\nInput: After we go outside, the grass would be wet and cold.\n\n### Answer\nWet\n\n### Example Answer:\nInput: The question asks us which of the two statements is true.\n\n### Statement A: A person who uses a wheelchair or guide dog is classified as disabled. \nOption 1: TRUE\nRationales: This statement is true according to Section 3.1 (b) of the Ontario Human Rights Code which states that a person with \"a condition that requires assistance or assistance from a guide dog or a wheelchair\u201d falls under the definition of disabled person.

{"text": "would grow what? Choices:  The flowers never grew B: Weeds C: Roses E: Oranges D: Leaves\nRationales: The question asks about a situation in which someone doesn't have the ability to grow flowers. In this context, the choice that makes the most sense is B: weeds.\nThe phrase \"She sure didn't have\u2026\" suggests that it's not because of a lack of effort or ability, but rather due to a lack of skill. Roses (choice C) are a common type of flower and do not require special care or attention, which explains why they might grow even without any knowledge or experience.\n\n\"Flower\" (Choice A: flowers) is a bit more general, and would include any type of plant. However, it may be too general to be a good answer in this case, since it doesn't specify that the flowers must be flowers. \n\"Oranges\" (Choice D: oranges) are a fruit, which would imply that the person was actually growing an orange tree, instead of just trying to grow flowers.\n\"Leaves\" (Option D) would be the most appropriate answer if it was written \"she didn't have a potted plant.\" Otherwise, the answer wouldn't fit because she's not trying to grow flowers specifically but rather plants in general.\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\nRationales:\nStep 1: The sentence implicitly asks if there's an alternative to having a driver or waiting.\nStep 2: Determine the available options: having a driver or waiting for another person to pick one up. \nStep 2.1: Choose choices that make no mention of a driver's role, such as the person driving them.\nStep 3.1: Eliminate choices that are inappropriate based on the question's premises (driver or pickup).\nStep 3.2: Now, look for an answer choice that fits the description \"having a driver\".\n\nAnswer: The answer is A-having a driver.\n\nComment: This is a good answer to the request.

{"text": "had a perfect flower and it was going to be perfect the plant would choke. Choices:  A. plant with no green thumb B. always trying to do better and be perfect C. always giving up. D. never tries to replant flowers E. never gives up on anything she does\nRationales: Steps 1-3: To fully understand the question, we consider the word \"but\" because it typically has a negative connotation. So, the person's description of a \"perfect\" plant would have had to end in disappointment, which also implies that it did not actually end up being perfect. We eliminate both choices C: always trying to do better, and B. always trying to be perfect, as they would both indicate the person did succeed in trying to have a perfect plant. \nStep 5: Starting to think about D: never tries to replant flower. This one actually works very well, but it does not quite match up fully with the original question and answer choices. In the paragraph, we are told about the plant that did not actually make it through the entire season as it was stressed due to being transplanted. So, if this is the case, why would the sentence \"She never tries to replant her flowers\" be a likely answer? \nStep 6: This is where, in practice, you need to think of multiple answers to a question to come up with the correct choice. To think we must understand that E: never gives up, does not necessarily imply that she will never fail. It simply means that she will not give up. In addition, E: never gives up is an outlier, if you can spot an outlier, you can usually spot the correct answer. \nStep 7: This is an indication that the correct answer should be somewhere between B: always trying to do everything perfect and E: never gives up on any task.\nStep 8: In summary, the answer is between A: plant with no green thumb and E: never gives-up. \nStep 9: Because we can combine both of these, the correct answer is E: never gives up.\nAnswer: E. never gives up.\n\n\n### Instructions\nAnswer the following questions about writing.\n\n### What is the most important part of a book or a report?\n\n### Demostration\nInput: How is an online bookstore different from a", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "would grow roses or other plants, they all died Choices:  A. roses B. plants C. green thumb D. roses and plants\nRationales: First, we should thoroughly understand the question. The statement \"She sure didn't have any green thumbs\" indicates that the person does not have the ability to successfully grow plants, specifically roses or any other plants that die frequently. \nStep 2. Determine the answer options each of them relates to. \nStep 1. Consider the choice A: roses - the wording \"roses or any other plants\" indicates we should exclude roses as a possibility, although roses can be grown. \nStep 5. Exclude choice B: plants - the phrase \"roses or any\" indicates that any types of plants, in addition to roses, can die. (We can then exclude any answer choice that only includes roses or any other specific plants). \nStep 6. Exclude options C-D: green thumb and roses and plants respectively. The phrase \"she didn't have any\" is an affirmation that she indeed did not have any green thumbs or plantations.  \nStep 7. Choice E should be the correct answer. This is because, regardless of the type of plants chosen (roses or any other plant), they would all die. \n\nAnswer: E: either roses or any other type of plant would have been included.\n\nInput: What was important to them so they went to a different location? Choices: 1. A: The beach 2. B: the boardwalk 3. C: the surf 4. D: The sunbathe 5. E: The lifestyle\nRationales: Choice 1: The beach. The beach is an area that can have sand, and it can vary in size and shape. It can also have boardwalks, and therefore the beach is a likely environment to feature boardwalks. Choice 2: The boardwalk. It is an area with long wooden paths that can lead to other attractions of interest, such as beaches. Choice 3: Surf.

First, it's important to understand the context and identify the key details to consider. The statement \"She sure didn't have the green thumb\" indicates that she was unable to grow plants successfully but \"she kept trying to water them and ended up destroying\" which suggests that even after her efforts to improve her skills, she was unable to achieve positive results ultimately resulting in the destruction of the plants.\n\n2. We begin by eliminating answers that are clearly incorrect or have contradictory information.\n\n3. A: Water. This answer indicates that the person did not fail because of lack of water, but that she was actually watering the plants excessively or overwatering them, which is the opposite of what should be done to keep the plants healthy and thriving.\n\n4. B: Watering. This answers indicates that watering the plant is the main thing the individual was doing, which could lead to more clarity on how it was failing. \n\n5. C: Water. This option is also incorrect, as the person was actually doing the opposite of what should have been done, watering the plants by more than the plant needed. This shows that the person may be unaware of how their actions negatively impacted the plant.\n\n6. D: Overwatering. This answer choice has the opposite of what was intended, which was to not use too much water. It correctly reflects the problematic behavior.\n\n7. E: Underwater. This answer is also incorrect as overwatering is the opposite of what was meant by this, and it does not reflect the correct behavior leading to the plant's death.\n\n8. The remaining answer options are: B: watering and D: overwatering. Both of these reflect a behavior of an individual watering the plant excessively, whether it was more or less than the plant should have received. It's not clear if there was a pattern of behavior leading to the individual using too much water in this manner or if the behavior was a onetime occurrence. \n\n9.", "answer": " 36"}

A green thumb is a popular expression used to describe someone who has a knack for gardening or plant care. It's an idiomical expression that doesn't provide any specific details about where or how one has a green thumb.\n2. A pot indicates a small, container-like area that can hold a plant, but it does not specify if this is indoors or out.\n3. A tree suggests an outdoor area large enough to accommodate a tree-like plant. However, it doesn't indicate if the plant is already planted or still in the seedling stage, which can be fragile and need more attention than an already mature tree.\n4. A window sill is a vertical surface, usually attached to or near a window frame. This can be used to hold a small pot or plant.\n5. A yard indicates a large open outdoor space with enough soil for a plant to grow.\n6. The correct answer is D: a window sillon.

{"text": "might buy a flower to put in the ground. Choices:  A- B- C- D- E-\nRationales: To answer this question, evaluate each choice in relation to the context and details provided. Here are the steps for how to do this: \n1. Start by looking at the question itself and understanding the details and context. In this case, we are looking for a choice that indicates a lack of success or failure in maintaining a plant or garden.\n2. Once you have a good understanding of the details, eliminate any choices that do not make sense in the context or do not fit the details provided.\n3. Consider the remaining choices and evaluate which choice the sentence or question is referring to. In this problem, we notice that the sentence contains two statements about the subject: every time she thinks she might buy a flower, and every time she buys a flower. \n4. Based on these statements, we can eliminate any choices that do NOT mention buying flowers or that mention plants other than flowers.\n5. We are then left with two options: a green thumb, and not having a green thumb.\n6. Now, look at the remaining choices. The choice that refers to a green thumb is not a failure to have success maintaining a plant or flower since it means success in gardening. \n7.

Answer B: she watered them wrong is not a logical answer either since the plants didn't die because the person watering them watered them wrong.\n12. Choice D: she was far away from them. This is not a reasonable answer because she had to be close to them (for watering purposes) in order to water them correctly.

She didn't know what a green thumb was\nRationales: In the sentence what do you think it means? If yes then what does he say?\n1. The question asks about a \"green thumb,\" and we need to consider each option in terms of whether they are likely to indicate the possession of a \"green thumb\".\n2. A: She had a rose garden. This option fits with \"rose,\" but not with \"green.\" Therefore, it's not likely to be the correct answer.\n3. B: She had a green thumb. This option is unlikely to be the correct answer because it suggests green plants rather than green thumb. If this was the intention, they would say \"roses\" instead of \"plants\".\n4. C: She had a bummers garden. This option is not likely to be correct because a bummer garden refers to a failure, not a success.\n5. D: She just knew how to grow. This is not likely to be the answer because \"green thumb\" indicates an aptitude or prowess.\n6. E: She didn't know about green thumb. This does not make sense because having a green thumb is associated with being good at growing.\n7. Therefore we are left with choice A: She had a greenhouse. This makes sense as a person does not have a green thumb if they can't grow plants.\nAnswer: A. She had a greenhouse", "answer": " 42"}

Next, examine the answer choices, each of which describes an area of expertise that the person has mastered.\nStep 3. Consider each of the options one by one.\nStep 4. Starting with choice A F. This is incorrect because we know the person has difficulties and is often unsuccessful in whatever they do. Therefore, they would not have the skills or talent to excel in any field.\nStep 5. Now to choice B G. This can be excluded because we know the person is trying to improve or fix whatever they're working on, but they always encounter problems and failures. They would likely not be able to succeed in any field.\nThusly, Choice C E can now be considered for possible answers.\nStep 6. Choice C E:  C - Chemistry. This would be a suitable career path as chemistry is the study of matter and the changes it undergoes. People with a skill and talent in chemistry are likely to have a green thumb. So, this is a plausible answer, making it less likely to be the right answer. \nStep 7. But what about,  not C Chemistry, Choice E. Is it likely to be the correct answer?\nStep 8. Choice E:  Electricians. This is the most accurate answer because electricians install, maintain, and repair electrical equipment and systems. Those with a skill and talent for electrical repairs are likely to be able to keep plants healthy.

Choices: 1: a spider plant 2: succulents 3: a cactus 4: green and leafy 5: a lemon tree 5: an African violet 6: an aloe vera plant 7: a jasmine plant 8: a rose plant\nRationales: What is a green thumb, you may ask? Well, a green thumb is the ability to successfully grow plants in a home or garden. A green thumb is not necessarily someone with a high level of knowledge about plants but rather someone who can nurture and take care of plants successfully. \nShe sure didn't have one and it became more apparent every time she tried to grow a plant. For example, every time she thought to herself \"I'm going to get a beautiful plant\" and started taking care of the plant, she ended up with a dead plant.\nThis shows that she was unsuccessful in her attempts to grow plants and her \"green thumb\" was very inexperienced or unskilled. \nNow, let's look at the answer choices and assess their appropriateness for the question:\n1) A spider plant: this is a creeping, flowering, succulent plant that is native to tropical climates and does not meet the requirement of growing a green and leafy plant. \n2) Succulents: this option also does not fit with the requirement of growing a plant that contains green and leaves because succulents do not always contain green or leafy parts. However, they are generally considered hardy and easy to care for, unlike a spider plant.\n3) A cactus: this is a popular option among beginners. These plants require little water and tolerate harsh environments. This aligns with the given information as it suggests that the chosen plant will not be successful. \n4) Green and leafy: this was the intended plant. There was a miscommunication or misunderstanding that led to the error.\n5) Lemon tree: this appears to be a suitable answer, as it is green and leafy and requires less care. This does not align with the given information. \n6) African Violet: this is a colorful flowering plant that does not contain green.\n7) Aloe Vera plant: this is another flow", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "was watering the flowers they would die. Choices:  A green thumb  B: plant C: water D: fertilize E: flower pot\nRationales: First, interpret the phrases. \"She sure didn't have \u2026 green thumb\" implies that the person in question lacks the skill or ability to grow plant life. This means we'll be considering answer choices that are related to green thumbs and the ability to grow plants.\nTherefore, every other choice must not be the green thumb in question.\nNext, eliminate answer choices.\nOption A: a green thumb. Clearly, this is the answer the speaker is referring to, so there's no need to consider that. Hence, we can eliminate option A.\nOption B: plant. A plant, which is a living organism, can't die, so the choice cannot be the correct answer.\nAlso, a lack of a green thumb means that the person is unable to \"water the flowers,\" which again, means that they can't be the correct answer. That leaves us with options C and D.\nThese two options are related to watering and fertilizing the plant in order for it to grow healthy. This indicates that green thumbs must be capable of maintaining those activities and doing both at the same time for any given plant.\nHence, the correct answer is C: water D: is fertilize.\n\nAnswer: D: fertilize.", "answer": " 19"}

A verb can make a sentence incorrect grammatically because it does not agree with its subject.\n2. In the question, the verb is \"thought\".

Looking at Option B: Strong is a stronger choice than bad is. But what does strong mean?\n5. The phrase \"back to dead state\" could be taken to mean \"it was dead\" or \"it is currently dead\". Strong can be used with dead in that way. Strong does not mean good, though.\n6. Looking at Option D: If the answer is bad, then the sentence will say \"back to dead state\", so it will imply that the plant is dead, meaning that it's still a good option.\n7. This means we can remove this option as well because it did not make sense.\n8. Option A: Good can be used as a negative of Strong, but it is also commonly used to say something did not work.\n9.

{"text": "had a garden, she lost it. The answer was B: couldn't keep it growing and the plants died, but had no idea why.\nRationales: In this case, we have the following situation. The sentence has asked our protagonist about her inability to keep her garden growing, which led her to assume she had no green thumb. However, she does keep getting new plants for her garden and never had any issues with her other gardens. In other words, there is no clear cause for her inability to keep a garden growing.\nThis prompts us to focus on the two remaining options, A: she didn't have the time and B: couldn't grow anything. Both of these options are true and there is no clear explanation for her trouble. We can confirm this by looking at the sentence after the rhetorical question. It states that she has no idea why her gardens die.\nThis doesn't clarify if she had the time or not, as she is unsure what causes her lack of success with her gardens.\nSince we are unsure if she didn't have enough time or not, the answer is going to be either A: she didn'\n\nAnswer A: she didn' have any\nRationales: There is no further explanation given as to why she is unsure of the time factor. This is justified as there is no clear reason to exclude this option. Since we can't eliminate the option, we should select it, which is answer A.\n\nInput: Did they ever use a knife, and fork, if not they wouldn't eat with it. The answer was A: no one does.\nRationales\nThis rhetorical question follows a logical sequence. It first asks us if we have ever used a knife and a fork, then asks if we use them when we eat. This means that answer options need to fit both questions. We can start by comparing options. The first option (B) is not useful as it doesn't imply one uses a knife and fork. We also don't know if people use these utensils to eat with every meal.\n\nThe last three options (C), (D), and (E) follow this pattern.

{"text": "saw grass it turned into cement. Choices:  A. A green thumb B. A cement plant\nRationales: First, understand the question and the meaning of the words in the sentence.\n1. \"She sure didn't have\" is used to emphasize the contrast presented of her lack of success with plants. She does not have a \"green thumb,\" which is used as a metaphor here for her ability to grow plants.\n2. \"Cement\" and \"concrete\" are nouns referring to different types of hardened or solidified materials that are typically made from various ingredients such as sand and gravel.\n3. \"Grass\" is used as a metonym for natural vegetation typically found in yards or outdoors.\n4. \"Every time she thought she saw\" is meant to represent a recurring event where she thought the plant was grass, but it was actually cement or concrete.\n5. \"It turned into\" refers to the fact that the grass or vegetation that she believed to be growing did not end at the cement or concrete. The plant grew over the cement instead of growing underneath it or alongside it. \n6. Together, these phrases and facts make a strong metaphor for what's really happening, which is that \"she thought\" there was something growing, like grass, but it was \"cement\" or \"concrete,\" not grass.\n7.

Start over with a new plant  B: Make sure the plant stays healthy  C: Stop watering the plant  D: Start over with a whole new garden  E: Ask for help\nRationales: The question asks what to do when someone doesn't have a green (gardening) thumb and every time they try something with plants, their plants die. \"Start over with a new plant\" is probably not the best answer choice because it's not specific to this situation. For example, it could indicate starting new from a small plant, which would be hard to do since \"the flowers would die\". Choice B \"make sure the plant stays health\" is also not the best answer because it's not very specific. Choice C is the best fit for the question as it is specific to \"watering\" the plant. The question states that the person is trying something with their plants, and watering could be considered trying (or experimenting) with their plants. \nAnswer: C: Stop watering her plants", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": "was about to do what with the plants she killed them? Choices:  (A) Water (B) Fertilize (C) Cut the roots (D) Keep the flowerpot alive (E) Put an insecticide\nRationales: Answer: C. The phrase \"She sure didn't have green thumb\" implies that the person in question doesn't have a natural affinity for gardening or cultivating plants. This means that they often fail to produce fruitful, healthy plants, indicating that they may kill them unintentionally.\nRationales: The most reasonable explanation for the phrase in question is that the person in question is not good at taking care of plants and tends to either accidentally kill them or fail to properly nourish them, leading to their death.\nThe statement \"every time she thought she was doing well..\" suggests that this isn't necessarily deliberate or intentional, and instead, likely due to lack of knowledge or care.\n(D): The answer is C as a flowerpot is just a container for a plant and is not in and of itself responsible for killing the plant.", "answer": " 750"}
{"text": "has to plant that she gave up and throw away her tools? Choices: 1: green thumb 2: pots 3: soil 4: shovel 5: plants\nRationales: We should begin by evaluating each of the choices and determining what they have in common with the given problem. \n1. Green thumb and plant are both a part of gardening. This makes this pair a good choice for eliminating. \n2. Plant, pots, soil, shovel, green thumb are all involved in gardening. Thus, we can eliminate shovel, green, thumb and plant as the answer options because planting is a form of gardening. \n3. Green thumb and tools might sound similar, but actually tools are not involved in making sure one has a green thumb. \n4. Tools are not needed in order to throw shovels, plants or pots. Moreover tools are not necessary in order to plant plants. \nWe have now eliminated four out of the five answer choices, leaving us with pots, soil, and shovels. These are gardening tools, and she'd only throw them away if she thought she couldn't plant. \nThus, choice 5 is the most reasonable answer. \n\nAnswer: 5: Pots, soil, and tools\n\nInput: When did you take toasting? Choices:  G: In the morning C: Nightly D: Every other day E: First thing in the morning\nRationales: This question is testing the context of the usage of a particular word \"toasting\".

It might be better to include a wider group with this question, which brings us to answer choice D\n\nD: Every other day - Is a possibility of having a breakfast meal that contains toast, but doesn't provide a specific enough time frame.\nIn order to choose the best answer, A or E, we need to remove B and C from contention, so that only answer A and B remain. \nWhile the word'morning' does not always relate to the start of a day, here, it does. \nBy removing choice C because they've just answered the question", "answer": " 810"}

We look at each choice.\n2. Water the plant (choice A) is an obvious choice, but doesn't fit the \"inconsistent\" response implied in the question.\n3. Give it less water (choice B) doesn't match the implied \"inconsistent\" nature of the response.\n4. Don't use phone (choice D) is an unrelated, out of context expression.\n5. Try (choice C) is similar to \"give it less water,\" but again doesn't match the \"inconsistent response\" implied in the question, so it's not the correct answer. \n6. Use her phone (choice E) can work as an actual response that the woman might have, but the literal meaning is unrelated to the woman's actual problem of watering her plants. \n7.

Choices:  T: to please them B: to come to dinner D: to please you E: to be honest\nRationales: First, understand what the question asks. The phrase \"You made all her friends really\" mad\" means that the person has done something to upset or offend someone, and the phrase \"what'd she ask you at the\" end of the\" day\" is related to the event and inquires about the response.  \n1. Now we look at the answer choices.\n2. To please them (T in the answer choices) is not directly related to the mad event, so it does not make the most sense here.\n3. To be honest (to please you E) would be an appropriate response if the person offended someone by being disingenuous or telling a lie.

A \"green thumb\" is someone who possesses a skilled hand in planting trees or gardening. \nStep 2. So, we need to ask what's important to planting trees. \nStep 1.

Choice A: blacken, this is not one of the choices that describes growing back hair. Choice C: white. While white may come back, typically white would come back for the entire length of the hair, not just a portion of it as in the question. Choice D: grey.

Just because someone doesn't have a \"green thumb\" doesn't mean that they're not capable of planting and caring for a garden.\n- Option B: eat it, could be done, but doesn't make sense from the context.\n- Options C and D: we can eliminate them because we've already established that a garden is not being taken care of properly. \n- Option E: go away and leave it along, could be done but doesn't fit the context.\n- Option A makes the most sense here - it's the only option that can be done and would be appropriate for someone who doesn't have a green.\n- The complete sentence is: She didn't have a \"Green\" thumb, but she kept trying to show other people that she did, every time she thought about watering her plants or planting more, but then she would go away and leave the garden for months. - We still had to do a little analysis to pick the best option for what the person had tried to do.\n- Answer: A: Bury it, which means covering the garden with ground.\n\n## Answer\n\nChoices: \n-   A-E\n> Input: Do your teeth, eyes, or your knees bother you?

{"text": "was going to get something done what was the result? Choices:  Choices:  A green thumb B: rain C: good enough D: gardening E: work\nRationales: First, it's essential to understand the given question. The sentence describes someone who doesn't have a green(er) thumb, and proceeds to list what happens every time they think they're going to get something done.\nSecond, we identify each possible answer choice and determine if it follows the same pattern.\nThird, the question itself indicates that the result is something that isn't as expected - for example, it might be something that's not as good or isn't completed at all.\n\n1. The first answer choice is A: green thumb. While it's possible that having a green thumb might be the result instead of the intention, it's not the likely cause of failure since the question says that a green thumb isn't present.\n2. Option B: rain. This could be a plausible answer, as rain typically means it's difficult to complete anything due to weather conditions. However, it doesn't follow the same pattern as the original description and what's being expected.\n3. Option C: good enough. Having the project or task be finished, but not as good as it could have been (which is what \"she thought she was going to\" means), would follow the same pattern.\n4. Option D: gardening. While this option might not be the intended outcome, it does follow the same pattern as previously described, where the person doesn't actually accomplish what they set out.\n5. Option E: work.

{"text": "was improving, which part of the plant died? Choices: 1. A: stem  B: flowers C: leaves D: root E: buds\n\nRationales: The question asks for a specific part of the plant that would die under the stated scenario. \nStep 1. Read the options carefully to identify the possible correct answer. We know that the plant \"died,\" so we will look for an answer that refers to a \"death\" of any part of the whole. \nStep 2. First, consider each option and its connection to the death of the plant as a whole. \nA: stem has nothing to do with the death of the plant, so we can rule out this option. B: flowers. This also doesn't seem relevant as flowers are not the entire plant. The same goes for C: leaves, E: buds. These options only focus on portions or aspects of the plant. \nStep 6. Now consider the remaining option, which could be considered the entire plant, namely, the root. The root of a plant plays an essential role in supporting and transporting water and nutrients to the parts of the plant, allowing it to survive. This makes the answer D: root. \nStep 7. Thus, the correct answer is Option D: root.\n\nAnswer: D: root\n\nInput: When wearing a shoe, why is walking comfortable? Choices: 6\n\nRationales\nStep1: Understand the question as it is.

First, determine the goal of the story - in this case, it is to have a thriving garden. However, after the character makes a number of excuses for why she is unable to do so, the storyteller concludes that \"she sure didn't have green thumb.\"\nNow, consider each of the sentences and ask: Are they relevant to the story?\nChoice A states that \"no one ever cared about them\". This is not an excuse the character makes in the story.\nChoice B states that the character does not have enough space. While this is likely an underlying factor behind the character's struggles, it is not explicitly mentioned as an excuse in the text, so it does not warrant an answer.\nChoice C details how the character failed to care for their flowers properly. While this is an excuse that might be used in the text, it is not explicitly stated that way.\nChoice D states that the flowers are too fragile. While this might be an issue that contributed to the garden's failure, it is not explicitly expressed as a reason for a failure in the text.\nLastly, choice E states that the character never tried to get the flowers to grow in the first place.

These are examples of tasks we often think will help us to have a green thumb. \n4. However, if we keep in mind that the question asks about what we must think will keep the plant alive, then we can eliminate these options as they don't directly answer that question. \n5. Option A: Watering plants is a task associated with maintaining plant health, but it's possible to do this without having a green thumb.\n6. Likewise, we can eliminate option B as it's a maintenance task that doesn't guarantee success.\n7. Option C Fertilization. This may improve soil health and promote plant growth, but it may not be enough to ensure plant survival. \n8. Option D: adding a hand mixer. This may help with some aspects of plant care, but it may not address the underlying issue of lacking a green thumb. 9. Option E, checking the manual.

A ___ thumb is a common metaphor referring to a green thumb, which is a person who is very skilled in gardening. \n1. A: She dug her garden - This would not make it appear that she was capable of gardening, so it is not a plausible answer in this context.\n2. B: She had an allergy - A green thumb relates to the ability to garden successfully, while allergies don't necessarily indicate gardening-related skills. \n3. C: She was doing something different - Being \"doing something different \" doesn't necessarily mean being unable to garden successfully. A green thumb indicates success in gardening, so this option doesn't fit what we're trying to convey.\n4. D: She did some things to ____- Plant is an inappropriate word to use since it makes it look like she did something to the plant, but not what the sentence clearly implied.\n5. E: She didn't water - The sentence suggests that there was an intent to garden, so not watering could not possibly be what she intended to do.\n6.

The only relevant information here is the statement that \u201cevery time she thought she won somethig, it got cut down.\u201d This could suggest that she was a gardener, but it\u2019s unclear if she was a good one or not. We need to further analyze the available options to find the most suitable one.\nOption A: Gardener suggests that she tends to plants or a garden. This is supported by the statement that \"every time she thought she got something, it got cut dow\". In this case, the author is saying that everytime she thought she \u201cwon\u201d something, it \u201cgot cut down\u201d, meaning that her plants were getting destroyed. This could be attributed to gardening, but only one choice would fit.\nOption B: \u201cShe sure didn\u2019thave a green thumb\u201d and thought she \u201cwon something\u201d is inconsistent with the choice of D Nurse or E Surgeon. That being said, we can eliminate options D and E from consideration.\nOption C: Farmer doesn;t quite fit in with the rest of the choices here. In order to determine if this is applicable for a solution, we will look at the statements made about her and compare them to the choice of Farmer. The sentence \u201cShe sure did have a green thumb\u201d could imply that she tends to plants, or that she grows plants.\nOption D: \u201cShe sure didn;t have a green thumb \u201d and \u201cthought she won\u201d is consistent with B Gardener and C Farmer. The author said that she \u201csure didn;t have a greenthum\u201d and \u201cgot cut down\u201d. This is inconsistent with E Surgeon and D Nurse. These answer choices represent people who would have to take care of people and help make them better, which is not necessarily relevant to the question.\nOption E: \u201cEvery time she thought she won, it got cut down\u201d is inconsistent with option B Gardener.

Likewise, you can also eliminate \u201cC\u201d and \u201cE\u201d. \u201cC\u201d is a common noun but doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with the text.\nAnswer should be a verb, and \u201cE\u201d is a gerund so it\u2019s also not the right choice.\nNow we have two answers left, \u201cD\u201d and \u201cA\u201d.\nWe are trying to determine whether the sentence uses the right verb forms.\nIn this case, \u201cD\u201d should be the right choice. \u201cA\u201d can\u2019t be the right answer as the sentence talks about the character performing the action on her own accord repeatedly while \u201cD\u201d gives the right information that we're expecting.\nAnswer should be \u201cD\u201d or \u201cShe did a perfect job.\u201d\nAnswer: D.\n\nInput: Are you a fan of their music? Choices:  a) Not really. b) Yes. c) No thank you. d) Yes I do. \nRationales: \u201cNot really\u201d can replace both \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d. However, \u201cb\u201d is the right choice as it is more accurate. \u201ca\u201d can replace \u201cc\u201d, but it can not replace \u201cd\u201d. If the character is going to listen to the music, it does not make much sense to say no to the music. \n\u201cNot listening to the music\u201d can replace all the answer choices. \u201ca\u201d is not acceptable as it is grammatically incorrect. \u201cc\u201d is not the correct answer choice as it doesn\u2019t sound right. Hence, \u201cb\u201d is correct.\nAnswer: b.\n\nInput: The dog wants to eat the food, is it okay to feed them? Choices:  Yes.  No.  Not now.  Not yet!

{"text": "had to plant, what did she do and what would the effect be? Choices:  S: nothing B: throw up  C: cut the plant E: tear up D: ignore the plant\nRationales: First, we should understand the question and formulate a rough interpretation of the answer choices. The phrase \"every time she thought she had\" implies a repetitive action or behavior of planting without any positive result. \n1. Options B, C, and D involve a single action or decision like tearing up or cutting. If this were the correct answer, the phrase \"every time she\" would not be applicable. \n2. Option S: Nothing. Incorrect. It's implied that this act is done on a regular basis and that nothing positive results from this action, so \"nothing\" is not the most likely answer.\n3. It's important here to consider the effect of these actions. Choice A mentions \"tore up.\" This would cause damage and reduce the plant's overall health, impacting the next planting. \n4. Now, moving on to choice C: cut. This option is plausible, as it could produce a positive effect, for cutting away sections of dead or weak material would promote the overall health of the plant. \n5. In contrast, cutting away good material would be detrimental to the overall health of the plants, and this makes D: ignore the plant an unlikely answer.\n6. Comparing the likely effects of cutting with tossing or tearing, choosing B: throw up makes the most sense as it fits the situation well enough and has the most immediate, negative impact. \n7. Therefore, B: throw up is the correct answer. \nAnswer: B: throw up\n\nInput: What do you use to hold a door ajar while your friend checks the price tags? Choices:  None  B: hand  C: pocket  D: pocket watch  E: wall \nRationales: Starting with the first question in series, the sentence suggests we may have a door, or a way of leaving something ajar, but are seeking a companion item that may aid us in holding the door ajar.  \n1. If we exclude choice None, the second sentence of the pair tells us that we have a way to leave something ajar, but a wall can't be moved or picked up and will not work for the", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "had, what was the next thing she did? Choices: 1. A: watered 2. B: threw away 3. C: killed 4. D: pulled 5. E: potted\nRationales: First, comprehend the entire question. The phrase \"every time she thought she had,\" refers to a repeated mistake or misconception. It implies that the person failed to achieve the desired result every time.\n2. Evaluate each of the answers one by one: \n3. A: water: This could be an outcome of successful plant care, but it is not mentioned in the question. Therefore, it would not follow logically from the previous answer choices.\n4. B: threw away: Again, this may be a common reaction to a failed attempt in gardening, but it does not connect to the question.\n5. C: killed: This could be a consequence of plant care, but it would not necessarily follow in every case.\n6. D: pulled: This could be a result of improper plant care or misguided intention, but it's unclear how or when this would happen.\n7. E: potted: This is the correct answer because it's the most likely next step for a gardener who didn't achieve the desired result. Potting refers to replanting or transferring a plant to a new container, which could be due to several reasons, such as limited space in the previous container, soil depletion, or a plant's growth level changing. Potted indicates that the gardener is committed to trying again and taking the necessary steps to improve the outcome.\nAnswer: E, potted\n\nInput: What did student do when they saw the teacher? Choices: \n1. A: gave attention because she was wearing a school uniform \n2. B: give attention without the uniform \n3. C: ignore because she was wearing the uniform \n4.

The teacher is the \"teacher,\" a person who instructs or guides students. A uniform refers to a specific type of clothing worn", "answer": " 600"}

Choices:  C: cut them D: water them E: cut the plants\nRationales: The question asks what someone would do when the plants are not watered, presumably by the person with the \"green thumb.\"\n\n1. \"Cut them\" is not an appropriate action to take, given the word \"watered.\" This choice can be eliminated.\n2. \"Cutting the plants\" is possible but doesn't seem to be what the parent in question would do. They might trim the plants, but removing them completely doesn't seem like an appropriate reaction.\n3. \"Watering the plants\" is a possible option, but it would require the watering of the plants in some way, not taking a literal approach.\n4. \"Cutting them\" also fits with the context, as this could be seen as a symbolic way to remove all evidence of someone's attempt to grow plants.\n5. \"Watering them\" is the best choice to answer the question.

A: green thumb is a saying that indicates a person has a natural ability to grow plants and flowers. Choice B: flower is not a thing, and although it is related to plants and gardening, it doesn't fit with the context. Choice C: seed is also not a thing, and it doesn't make sense to water seeds. Choice D: tomato is a fruit, and we must consider that if we are talking about watering tomatoes, it would have to be plants that are needed to grow tomatoes, such as seeds or flowers.

{"text": "is ready to begin the next project she goes for a different one. Choices:  A \"a bad start\" B \"a slow death\" C \"a quick death\" D \"a healthy plant\" E \"a quick start\"\nRationales: The answer to the riddle is likely based on the phrase \"she sure didn't have\". She is likely a not-so-good gardener unable to maintain plants.\nWe'll start by ruling out options B and D (a slow death and a healthy plant) - they don't make sense. D doesn't seem to match the phrase \"sure didn't\", as if a bad gardener maintained a healthy plant, the result wouldn't be considered unhealthy.\nLet's move on to D and C (a quick start and a quick death). There are different ways to interpret these two phrases - for example, a quick start could refer to an impetus for a new project, not a seed. But both options don't seem to match.\nLet's look at the phrase \"a bad start\" once again. This phrase implies that she did a bad job, which would suggest that she is a bad worker and not a good gardener.\nLet's add the phrase \"didn't\" to \"a bad start\". If we remove it before \"a nice plant\", \"She sure didn't get a nice plant\" doesn't make sense. If this is the case, \"didn't get\" suggests that \"she\" should do something else.\nFinally, A is a good answer, as it makes sense based on the phrases that we've tried so far.\nAnswer: A \"a bad start\".\n\nInput: The best position that they would want during the performance would be the audience member?

First of all, one of the choices, \"just a farmer,\" has been included for humor. So let us not take it too seriously.\n2. Now we have four choices, A, B, C, and D, which all seem ambiguous at first.\n3. Let us look for the choice in which the answer is clear. For this, we need to know the meaning of \"gardener\". The dictionary defines a gardener as a person who is responsible for growing plants in a garden or in a large estate.\n4. So, if someone thinks of themselves as a gardener, they must be responsible for growing plants in their garden. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to say that they are a gardener. \n5. A gardener is someone who grows plants, and this must be someone who can see the plants grow, which means they have green thumbs.\n6. If someone has a brown thumb, it means that they kill everything they touch. Therefore, when someone has a brown thumb and they die, it implies that they have failed as a gardener.\n7. This means that the \"She sure didn't have green thumb\" part is incorrect, which rules out options A, C, and D. \n8.

Choices: 1: a green thumb 2: a pink thumb 3: a blue thumb 4: a purple thumb 5: a brown thumb 6: a black thumb 7: a white thumb\nRationales: First, we need to understand what a question or statement means. \nIn this case, the word \"thumb\" refers to general aptitude or ability rather than literal physical thumbs. \nWe can then consider the different answer options: \n1. A: She didn't have a \"green thumb\". This means she lacked a strong ability (thumb) for gardening or tending to plants. This is true and the correct answer. \n2. B: She didn't \"have a pink thumb\" means that she could not successfully perform gardening tasks, but it doesn't refer to gardening ability as a whole. Hence, this is not necessarily relevant to the question as it doesn't address the general ability. \n3. C: She didn't get \"a blue thumb\" either. This is similar to the previous option. \n4. D: She didn't necessarily obtain a \"purple thumb\" either. \n5. E: She wasn't \"brown thumb\" or \"black thumb\". These descriptions are related to lack of gardening abilities, but don't necessarily refer to gardening as a whole. \n6.

Choice D: yellow is a popular option and makes sense if the person who tried to grow plants was a beginner gardener.\n4.

{"text": "'d grow anything, it turned to dust. Choices:  A) potted plants B) garden C) windows D) water tower E) soil\nRationales: Start by noting that this question refers to \"She\" or the subject of the sentence.\n1. First, we eliminate all other options that could refer to someone else except the subject or the pronoun \"She.\" For example, \"he\" cannot be the correct answer because this phrase does not mention \"he.\"\n2. Similarly, eliminating \"you\" or \"her\" would also be incorrect, as it doesn't match the subject of the statement. If this question refers to a singular subject, the pronouns in the answer choices should also agree in number, so A, B, D, and E cannot be the right answers.\n3. Now, we look at each of the remaining options:\n4. Choice C: garden. This could be an appropriate answer if the phrase refers to an area outside, as this could be an area where \"She\" is attempting to grow things. However, if this is not the context, we can eliminate this option based on the statement \"every time [She] thought she'd grow...\" - referring to the future tense suggests that the area where plants are grown is different from where they're grown or thought to be grown.\n5. Choice B: potted plants. As mentioned previously, the phrase does not exclusively refer to an area outside, so the context or meaning of potted plants could still be applied. However, since the statement contains the phrase \"thought she'd grow,\" it doesn't necessarily mean She was actually planning to grow plants in potted form. Instead, only the picturing or thinking of such growth is included in the statement. Therefore, we can eliminate this choice.\n6. Choice C. Windows: This could be a suitable answer if the subject is referring to the frames that enclose a window and their plants. However, the phrase uses the term \"plants\" and \"grow\" rather than \"trees\" or \"shrubs,\" which would be more likely to be described as plants or shrubs within the context of a window frame. Since a window pane is not the same as a plant, we can exclude this option.\n7.

Identify the problem.  \nStep 2. Identify the choice that best solves the problem.\nStep 1. The question identifies that the person doesn't have a green (or, successful) thumb, meaning that she never grows anything well or has trouble keeping her plants alive.\nStep 2. The phrasing \"every time she thought she had a good plan\" implies that she tries and has \"good plans\" when it comes to planting and growing the plants (C, D, E).\nStep 3. Each of the choices above has at least one example to support it, with (C, D, and E) all containing a statement of one type of solution.\nStep 4. This leaves A, which only states that she burnt or killed everything she tried to grow. This does seem unlikely, and is contradicted by the statement that she \"has had a lot of luck\"\nStep 5.

{"text": "'d do well with ______, she'd kill plants with ______. Choices:  A; water B: herbs C: pets D: seeds E: flowers\nRationales: The question is asking us to identify the missing words. The first word is \"she\", which is the subject of the sentence, and the second word is the word missing from the sentence. We're given two choices for the correct answer to choose from. If we examine each word, we can determine which one is more likely to be the correct missing word. The sentence already contains the word \"she\". \n\n\"She sure didn't have...\" It's likely that the word that must be determined here is a complementary word. A complementary word completes the sentence and makes it more specific. \nThe word \"Sure\" can be a prefix for word certainty, so one of the options could be \"She sure had...\" As we'll see in a moment, this option is incorrect. In this case, \"Sure\" is a suffix - more specifically, an appositive. The word \"sure\" acts as a modifier, describing or giving information about the previous word. \nThe next line (\"every time she thought she's do well with...\") is clear in that it references an event, person, or idea as an action. This further indicates that the missing word is a complementary word that completes the sentence, making it more specific.  We can eliminate one option, which is \"she sure had.\"\n\nSo, now we only have one choice left: She sure didn'tt have a green thumb.\n\nThe question now becomes \"Why did she not have a green thumb?\" We can understand this by examining the specific words used and their meaning in the context of the sentence as a whole. \"She sure didn't\" is a very strong phrase, implying a definite lack, indicating that the sentence is describing something the listener/reader already knows, not something unexpected or uncommon. \nIn this context, it makes sense that the person doesn't have a green tooth because the plants around her are dying or not growing well. \nWe can see the connection between \"every time she thought she would do well with\" and \"kill plants with\". \nSo, the most likely answer is that \"She sure didn'tt have\" = \"She was not fortunate enough to", "answer": " 134400"}
{"text": "had something growing it seemed like that. Choices:  A. yellow B. brown C. white D. green E. shriveled\nRationales: First, understand the question and the choice options. \n1. Consider each choice option.\n2. Option A: Yellow. This is a plausible answer, but it's specific and too descriptive. When a choice is too specific or specific from the wrong object, it's usually best to reject it. Yellow flower specifically mentions \"yellow flowers\", so it's not in the range of reasonable choices. \n3. However, choice B: brown. is a little too broad. We're talking about someone having green thumb or not, and brown might be applicable, but it's too broad to be considered a suitable answer.\n4. Option C is eliminated by this logic, it's not specific enough and not green as the question wants.\n5. Option D is a more likely candidate, but she \"sure didn't have a Green thumb\", and thus should not have a green thumb. This is a contradiction and doesn't sound accurate. \n6. Option E: shriveled. is a plausible choice but more specific and related to flowers, which is not relevant in this context.\n\n7. We have narrowed it down to D & E.\n8.

A) Blue: This can be regarded as a generic choice as many places are colored with other colors at night or in different seasons.\n2. B) Grey: This color is commonly used to describe gray days.\n3.

{"text": "could grow? Choices: \nA: broccoli B: flowers C: trees D: vegetables E: grass\nRationales:  1. The expression \"to have a green thumb\" means to be successful in growing plants, so the question asks us to determine what the opposite of that is.\n2. We begin by eliminating the choices that would not describe a person who is failing to grow plants \n3. Flowers (choice B) are typically grown inside and aren't plants that require a green thumb, so this answer is unlikely. \n4. Trees (choice D), vegetables (choice C), and grass (choice E), however, can all be grown outside and require a green thumb to grow successfully, so they're still plausible options.\n5. By looking at the overall context of the sentence, we can determine that the sentence implies that the person couldn't grow food in general. Hence, A: broccoli (non-edible plant), is likely not the right answer\n6. This leaves us with the choices: choice A: broccoli, B: flowers, C: trees, and E: grass, where we can eliminate choice E: grass.\n7. Flowers (choice) aren't edible, so can't be grown for consumption, meaning the person couldn't use them for food. This choice is eliminated.\n8. The second portion of the question can also be interpreted as a statement of \"every time she tried,\" suggesting that the person made several tries to grow plants, not just one. Hence, the phrase \"each time\" is not the correct choice.\n9. The overall implication of the question is that the person couldn's food any type of plant, so B: flowers, C. Trees and E: grass are all likely incorrect choices. \n10. Choice B: flowers is not a suitable answer, as flowers aren't food and aren't generally grown for consumption.\n11. Choice C: trees is likely not the right choice, as trees aren't food and don't usually grow in a pot inside, so a person wouldn't be able to cultivate them indoors as food.\n12.

{"text": "was doing what? Choices: \n\n\nA: plant\nB: water\nC: sun\nD: fertilizer\nE: weed\n\nRationale: Step 1: Understand the structure of the question. The key phrase here is \"every time she thought\". This implies that the person's actions, not the outcome, are being referenced in the question. Choice A: plant, is something the person would do; the outcome of this action would be a plant. This is unlikely to be the correct answer since the question is not about what someone does, but rather the outcome of their actions.\nStep 2: Eliminate the outcomes that are related to the person's actions: Choice B: water, Choice D: fertilizer, Choice E: weed.\nOutcome that is related to person 'A': water, Choice B: water: this means that each time the person \"watered\" (the action) the plants (the outcome) they ended up with plants that didn't grow well. \nChoice D: fertilizer: indicates that fertilizing plants (the action) usually leads to bad growth (the outcome) but in this case, it didn't.\nChoice E: weed: indicates that each time they weeded (the action) it resulted in weeded plants and no growth.\nOutcome that are unrelated to the person's action: Choice C: sun. The sun is not an outcome of someone's action because they cannot control it.\nStep 3: Reconsider the remaining choices. The person's actions do not directly affect how plants grow. Their actions only impact whether or not their plants grow. The key insight is that people cannot control how plants grow.\nStep 4: Consider the remaining choices. Choices A, B, and C are the only choices that have actions that are related to the outcome: Choice A: plant B: water, C: sun.\nChoice D is unlikely as it is related to the person' (their action) and not the outcome.\nChoice E is unlikely because it is unrelated to the person\u2019s actions.\nStep 5: Consider each of the remaining choices in turn to determine the best choice.

{"text": "was going to grow something she instead? Choices: \n A: killed it B: ate it C: poisoned it D: watered it E: stole it\nRationales: The question indicates that a person, \"She\", is unable to grow anything she plants and the options give examples of what happened to her garden.\n1. We can start by checking that the choice (B: ate it) doesn't fit the question by saying that the person \"ate it\".\n2. (D: watered it) doesn't apply because while the person might say they watered it, in fact they were only washing their hands and not actually watering the plant with the water.\n3. (E: stole it) doesn't indicate a reason why she couldn't grow anything, so it's not the correct answer. \n4. This leaves us with two options - someone who (A: killed it) or someone who (C: poisoned it) killed whatever they tried to grow. Since we have two opposing options we can eliminate both of and say that the person probably (D: watered) their plants.\n\nAnswer: D: watered\n\nInput: What are two words that are both seven letters in length? Choices:  a) Aunt, boomer b) Cabbage, dodo c) Chimney, cough d) Deer, turtle e) Kettle, puppet\nRationales: Since we know that each of the words must have seven letters we can start by eliminating all the pairs that are either too (cough) short (kettle) or too long (cabbage).

Choices: \nA: green beans B: avocados C: flowers D: leaves E: weeds\nRationales: The question can be broken down into two parts: she didn't have a \"green thumb\" and she thought she'd \"planted\" what. \nThe first part of the question is to find the suitable answer for \"she didn\u2019t have a green thumb.\u201d This part involves eliminating choices that are not suitable or relevant to a green thumb. \nShe didn't have a 'green thumb' can be broken into green beans, avocados, flowers, leaves and weeds, whereby each of these is being evaluated on how they relate to a green thumb. Choices A and B have to be eliminated as they do not make sense. The same fate applies to the last 2 choices C and D; the 'green thumb' is used to indicate the ability to keep plants and flowers alive. \nSo, from now onwards, choices that can be used to find more suitable ones are A, B, C, and D as they should indicate vegetables, fruits, flowers and herbs respectively. Based on this, Choice A and B can be eliminated as they have already been eliminated before. This leaves us with C and D. So, let's find out the ones that fit the best. \nIn the passage it explicitly states, she thought she'd have what. This can be interpreted as a guess, assumption or presumption of some sort.

Choices:  C: sea foam  A: sea creature  D: marine fish E: sea water\nRationales: The question requires us to think of other types of sea animals. We need to think of creatures that are not fish, or those that are fish-like but not actually fish. When considering these options, we can eliminate choices that do not match the requirements, such as A, B, and C because they do not adequately fulfill the description. It can be noted that E does not actually fit any of the criteria as it is a type of water, not an animal. We can see that D is a viable option because it is \"marine fish.\" We can eliminate all of the choices and determine the correct answer.\n\nInput: What type of job would an ex athlete need? Choices:  D: personal trainer  C: coach  E: nutritionist  A: sales associate  B: sports agent\nRationales: First, we need to understand the question. It asks about specific jobs that an ex-", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "could grow an eleventh cactus, its pins fall off. Choices:  A green thumb means how good you are at what? B: what time its sunset C: when its sunrise D: when its sunset E: when its sunrised\nRationales: The sentence gives us a lot of information that is useful in guessing the right answer. First, we understand that a green thumb refers to a person's ability in gardening or plant care. \nSecond, the example uses the word \"cactuses\", which contains a plural form (cactuses) and a singular form (cactus). Plural words like \"eleventh\" can have a singular meaning in the sentence, so using \"eleventh cactus\" in this example doesn't necessarily mean there are eleven different individual cactuses being referred to.\nThird, it becomes clear that \"pins\" and \"sunset\" are the two important things to pay attention to. While other words such as \"eleventh\" or \"thought\" can be understood, these two things are essential in determining the correct answer.\nFourth, let's think about the common meanings of the words \"time\" and \"sunset\". While \"time\" could be referring to a specific time on a clock, it is usually used to refer to a person's schedule or daily routine. Therefore, even though the word may appear multiple times in the example, it doesn't seem relevant to the question about a person's ability to grow plants.\nFinally, with the help of the additional information we now have, it's clear that \"sunset\" has a special meaning in this context. While it could be referring to the sunsets around the world or when the sun goes down, it is also used to refer to the end of an era, as in \"the sunset of the British Empire\".\n\nConclusion: Green thumb could be referring to a person's skill in gardening and plant care. \nGreen thumb means how good you were at planting plants.\n\nAnswer: Green thumb means how good you're at planting.\n\nInput: A small hole was drilled into the middle of the door, why would a mechanic do this?

{"text": "was ready to plant what? Choices: 1: seeds 2: a house 3: flowers 4: her new car 5: grass\nRationales: First, understand the question: She didn't have a \"green thumb,\" meaning that despite her intentions, planting was not successful or had detrimental effects, typically due to incompetency. \nNow, explore the answer choices. None of the statements make any sense since the subject in the question didn't seem to have a good track record with gardening at all.\nSince we can cross all the choices out, there is a reasonable chance that the answer is 5: grass, as it is the only choice that mentions grass and has no other connotation.\nAnswer: 5: grass\n\nInput: We got hit by a freak snow storm yesterday. Today, all that snow has melted. How would you describe this kind of weather? \nChoices: 1: Wash 2: Blizzard 3: Rain 4: Snow 5: Cloudy day\nRationales: The question describes a sudden change in weather, where \"snow\" has suddenly disappeared and been replaced by \"rain.\"\nTo answer the question, we need to identify a suitable term to describe this shift, which would either indicate the presence of precipitation such as blizzards or rain, or a change in temperature that could have precipitation such as cloudy days. \nWe should cross out the options that do not fit the scenario outlined in the problem. For instance, if it was warm and humid instead of cold and snowy, then blizzard would not be applicable since it denotes low temperatures and precipitation.\nSince it was snowy the day before and now there is rain, option 5 (cloudy day) would be a suitable response if we simply stated that it was now cloudy.\nOption 3 (rain), on the other hand, would be a suitable response to describe the question, as rain is a sudden change that can occur after precipitation or on cloudy days.\nAnswer: 3: Rain", "answer": " 1660"}
{"text": "planted a seedling it had died. Choices:  A) She didn't have much luck with her gardening projects B) She gave up on gardening\nRationales: (1) First, \"a green thumb\" is actually a saying, with a figurative meaning. It is supposed to be in contrast to a person who does not have a green thumb (meaning they are not good at gardening). In this sentence, it is meant to mean the exact opposite. This option means gardening/planting would not bother this person, which is not the intended meaning.\n\n(2) Now, we can focus on what we can do to find the right answer.\n\n(3) We can eliminate some choices by reasoning.\n\n(4) Choices B) and (E) do not make logical sense, so neither could be correct. \n\n(5) Choice A) does make sense, but it is not necessarily related to having a good (or bad) thumb.\n\n(6) Next, we can start checking one answer against the clues.\n\n(7) Option (B) does not make sense, as (A) is the sentence, and the thought of a green thumb is to garden well.\n\n(8) So, the choice that fits best seems to be answer (A).\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: What do you call the car that has two drivers?

Here we start by simplifying the first equation. If a number is 2 more than 1 time a number, then add 2 to the 2 more number, multiply by 5 add 20 and finally divide by 445. Adding 2 to 1 is the same as multiplying by 2, so we need to divide by 2. 5 is 2 less than", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": "had a good hand with growing something it turned in what? Choices: \tA: flower pot B: dirt C: mold D: plant E: wilt\nRationales: One important rule for this question is: the word 'everytime' means that every time something happens, it's referring to every instance.\n1. We can eliminate Choice 'A' - there\u2019s no mention of flower pots.\n2. \u2018B\u2019 is incorrect because there\u2019s no mention if dirt, mold or a plant.\n3. Choice 'D' is incorrect because there\u2019d be no turning involved if the plant was already in flower.\n4. Choice 'E' cannot be selected, as the expression \u2018the turn of events\u2019 refers to something changing or developing, whereas wilt only happens after a plant dies.\n5. Option C is incorrect because every time she thought she made a good hand with growing the mold is not the same as plant.\n6.

{"text": "would plant a carrot in the garden they would end up as what? Choices: \n  A: flowers B: chairs C: pottery E: a plant\nRationales: First, think about what else a green thumb might be used for. The answer choice \"a plant\", choice E, does not make sense, because a plant is the expected outcome of having a green thumb. \nThe answer could also be one of the following: \n  flower (choice A), chair (choice B), pottery (choice C), or even a tree (choice D), as a plant could be anything from a small herb to a large tree or shrub. \nTo narrow down the options, you need to determine if plants are a probable outcome of having a green hand, by looking at the phrase \"every time\". If having a green thumb meant every time the plants turned out to be flowers, chairs, pottery, or trees that would mean having a green thumb could guarantee plant success and the answer would be easy. Unfortunately, the sentence states the opposite, \"she sure didn't have _______________, every time she thought she might plant a carrot in her garden, they would end up as something else\", which clearly indicates that having a green thumb did not work for her. This is an indication \"a plant\" is not the correct choice for the question.\nThe sentence describes the opposite of having a green thumb, meaning \"her carrots don't get planted\" or \"her carrots turn bad\". This is the negative connotation of \"every time\" - not having a good plant outcome because one does not own a green thumb. This negation is evident because the sentence includes the opposite (not) of the expected outcome (she had a green thumb). The correct response would be the opposite of \"a plant\". Therefore one can conclude option A: flowers, choice B: chairs, or even option C: pottery. Since the question does not mention \"every\", we cannot choose china since a \"pot\" has the same shape as pottery. Choice C seems to be the most suitable answer in this case as chairs were mentioned by another option and \"pottery\" has too many meanings, which makes the question ambiguous.\nAnswer: C. Pottery.\n\nInput: What are you asking if your child has 6 pennies and 3 nickels? Choices:", "answer": " 109,200,000"}

{"text": "did she killed the plant. Choices:  A) got it from the nursery B) wanted to give it to a friend C) watered it too much D) wanted more pots E) wanted it to grow bigger\nRationales: First, understand the question and make an assumption, which is that one needs a green thumb to take care of a plant. We'll also assume here that green thumb = good plant care. \nNow, consider the possible answer choices.\n1. From \"Killed a plant\" it's clear the person doesn't have a green (good) thumb.\n\n2. If we're looking for the reason she didn't have a good thumb: \na. In the first part it says \"She sure didn't have ______ (good/green) thumb\". This means \"Sure\" is an affirmative thing that is the opposite of \"She\". Therefore, \"She sure didn'....\" means she didn't have \"______ thumb\".\nb. From the second part it is clear she didn't have that \"______ thumb\"\nc. She ____ed the plant. This means we should look at options that mean \"killed\", like \"killed the plant\", to find the answer.\n3. Now, read the answer choices \"B\" got it from the nurseries\" and \"C\" watered it too much\". We understand that either the nursery she bought the plant from or the plant itself would be dead if \"she ____ed it\", so these can be eliminated.\n4. \"Wanted to give it to a frend\" will not be able to make the plant grow, so it is eliminated.\n5. \"Wanted more pots\" can't be the reason because plants do not fit into other pots; rather, a pot has to fit a plant.\n6. \"Wanted it to grow bigger\" was mentioned already in the question and is now mentioned again in the answer choices. So that cannot be the reason that she didn't have the good thumb.\n7. The answer therefore must be choice E: \"Wanted it to grows bigger\".\n8. The green thumb means she took care of the plant well, which means the plant grew bigger.\n9. Eliminating the options that don't fit the grammar.

{"text": "was watering her flower her brother would yell at her. Choices:  A : put the watering can too close B : plant too many C : forget D : use her phone E : give up \nRationales: This is a simple exercise to illustrate one of the fundamentals to successfully answering a question. The primary step is to carefully read, understand, and interpret the question, paying attention to important details, like the questioner's intentions or the phrases' meaning. \nIn this example, the correct answer choice was identified by focusing on the correct meaning of the key phrase \"thought she was watering her flowers\". One would think that the watering of flowers was indeed an act of helping nurture the growth of the plants. However, as stated in the question, the watering can actually was watering her flower. \nThis information is crucial to determine the correct answer choice in this question. \nAnswer: A: put the watering can to close\n\n# Input: She was on a diet what does she probably do to the cheesecake? Choices: A: eat it B: throw it away C: smell it D: keep it in the cooler E: give it to a friend\n\nOutput: cheesecake: A: eats it B: throws it away C: smells it D: keeps it in the cooler\n\nrationales: In the first step, after understanding the meaning of the phrase, \"was on a diet\" it clearly indicates that she was on a diet trying to eat healthy and lose weight, and that she was not supposed to be eating a cheesecake. \nThe answer choice, B : throw it away C, smells it D: keep it is cooler would only match the situation in which she wasn't on diet.

The plant was left after she got rid of the bad end. She thought she did a good job, so she kept the plant. This means B was put in the garage.\nC. If bad ends don't kill the plant she'll put it in the garge. So, this choice can't be true for this sentence. C) moved the plnt isn't a best answer. \nD. Her bad end killed the plant. So E) dropping the plant is the best answer.\nD.

Consider each answer choice carefully. Choice A: weeding. While she may think she's weeding, she may actually be removing healthy plants which could lead to a lack of growth and eventually kill them.\n2. Consider choice B: fertilizing. Even if she's putting fertilizer on the top, it can't help if she's applying it in the wrong way.\n3. Eliminate choice C: watering in right way.\n4.

{"text": "might grow what? Choices: 1 - a tomato, 2 - a flower, 3 - an onion, 4 - peas, or 5 - a watermelon\nRationales: First, understand the question - what is she trying to grow that leads her to having no success or a \"green thumb\"? \nWe need to consider each of her options:\nOption 1 - A tomato. This is certainly not an option - a tomato would require a lot of care and experience, and we've been led to believe that she doesn't have either of these.\nOption 2 - A flower. This could be growing from a seed, which could potentially take time to come to fruition, but her choice of \"every time\" eliminates this option.\nOption 3 - An onion. She may intend to start growing it from seeds, wait a few weeks until it comes up, and then move it to another location to grow. This option is most likely, but we have no confirmation that it didn't grow to be a tomato or a pea.\nOption 4 - Peas. Again, they will likely require regular tending, but the option to grow from seeds can work as well. \nOption 5 - A watermelon. Since she didn't mention \"green thumb\" again, it's possible that she didn't intend to grow from seeds. If she only intended to plant the seeds and forget about them, it's unlikely that she could end up with a watermelon when she's not paying attention!\nSo there are three legitimate options - an onion, peas, and a watermelon!\nAnswer: 5 - a waternmelon \n\nInput: How should you dispose of a broken window?

Review the answer choices and consider who she is. She's usually a \"plant care expert\" who doesn't have experience of plant care. \n3. Choice A- dying plant. This has the most logic and most closely fits what the question asks.\n4. Choice B- cat bed: if this \"plant\" is dead, it would make a less than suitable cat bed, so this choice is unlikely.\n5. Choice C - Yellow plant: Choice C refers to a dying plant; the green color indicates that the plant is healthy.\n6.

Now, it's only necessary to determine if the plants are \"getting\" (growing) or \"going\" (dying) since we're not looking for the color of the plants.\nA: pale is not relevant to the question and doesn't change whether the plants are growing or dying.\nB: white is a possibility, and can make the situation confusing a bit, but if the plants die due to some infection and not due to bad soil or climate, they could indeed have a white appearance and still be considered dead.\nD: dead is the most common answer since dead plants won't grow to make it possible to determine if they're brown or green.\nE: is also the more common outcome.\nAnswer: D dead as it is the most likely outcome of someone with a \"brown thumb.\"\n\nInput: The dog was being difficult who is they speaking to?

We can try to look for any potential positive interpretation of this choice, but ultimately we will understand the phrase as \"difficult person\"; furthermore, this type of metaphoric phrasing doesn't follow a correct, grammatical structure, which makes it less likely.

A: she forgot to water it. This answer implies that the only reason she didn't have a great garden was that she forgot to water the seeds/plants. However, we know from the sentence that she did not have great results on other gardening attempts. \n2. B: she forgot to weed the garden. This answer implies that she would forget to take care of the garden as a whole until the weed problem became noticeable. This is not supported because the question indicates she tried \"to do something about the garden\" and didn't have good results. \n3. Choice C: she forgot to water and to weed the garden is inconsistent with the answer to choice B. If she forgot to water the garden, she likely would also forget to weed it too, implying choice C has the same problem as choice B. \n4. Choice D is irrelevant because she did not think about the garden - she forgot to water and forgot to weed. Choice E is contradictory because if she is not thinking about the garden and has \"been busy\" other things, it makes logical sense that forgetting to water and weed comes next in our list of explanations why the garden was not great. \n5.

{"text": "could grow something, she had what? Choices: 1. A: flowers 2. A: plants 3. B: problems 4. C: issues 5. D: disappointment\nRationales: Understanding the question helps us understand the correct answer to the task. We need to determine what \"She sure didn't have the green thumb that she originally thought she could grow something,\" means. It means that she had difficulty growing things and had difficulties with her planting attempts.\nEliminate incorrect information: We can eliminate some wrong choices by identifying false information in the given statement.\nEx: She sure didn\u2019t have the green thumb is not correct. It does not mean she did not have a green thumb. As per the definition of green thumb, it can be a positive or a negative meaning.\n\nNext, we can figure out which answer is the correct one:\n\n1. It is impossible to compare her original thought with her actual outcome. It is a wrong choice because it does not answer the stated question. Hence, A: flowers is wrong or incorrect and should be eliminated.\n2. It is a common perception and known fact that flowers never become plants and vice-versa. So, A: plants is also wrong or incorrect and should also be eliminated.\nEx: She did not have the green thumb that was expected is correct. Now let\u2019s focus on the second half of the sentence - She thought she could grow something.\n\nSo, here we need to find what she thought she could grow and what happened or what did she have.\n\n3. B: problems is incorrect. It is implying that she had a lot of problems and issues while growing things. So, B: problems is false and should be eliminated too.\nEx: She tried to grow things but failed every time is false, and it does not answer her original thought. So, C: issues can be eliminated too. It is just a redundant choice.\n\n4. C: issues is also wrong or incorrect. Why because C: issues implies problems and issues that are related to her attempts to grow plant things. If that was possible, she did not have issues and not problems. And she surely had problems not issues. Hence, C: issues is a wrong choice and should be eliminated as well.\n\nFrom the above examples, we can clearly understand that to find the correct answer, we need to think about", "answer": " 14"}

It's unlikely that someone with a \"green thumb\" could not grow a plant.\n2. White thumb - This indicates a person with inadequate plant-related abilities, and it would seem unlikely that a person with a \"white thumb\" would be unable to grow a plant\n3. Green thumb; This indicates a person with an aptitude for growing plants but not a special skill. It would seem unlikely that this person could not grow a plant, as they could be more likely to be proficient at the task.\n4. Brown thumb; This indicates a lack of ability to grow plants, but could mean that the person is unable to grow a plant. \n5. 0 thumb; This indicates a complete inability to grow plants, which is what the prompt asks about.\n6. \"0 thumb\" is the correct answer choice, as it is the only answer choice that represents complete inability.\nAnswer: 0 thumb\n\nInput: He is not being serious when he claims to have a green thumb?

{"text": "had watered her plants correctly, they would wilt in a few days. Choices:  A - The soil was not healthy B - Didn't have proper nutrients C - Wasn't her soil D - The way she watered was in error E - She was doing it wrong\nRationales 1. First, let's understand the question. The sentence implies that a person does not have a green thumb, and as a result, every time she thinks she's doing the right thing with her plants, they wilt within a few days.\n2. So, we need to evaluate each of the answer choices. Each one must pass several tests to determine whether it is plausible and accurate.\n3. Our first option, A, is the soil unhealthy. A healthy soil is one that is rich in nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and able to retain moisture and oxygen. If the soil of the person's garden was not healthy, it would likely contain poor nutrition and lack essential elements for a healthy plant.\nThus, A, soil is not healthy, is not a suitable answer to the statement.\n4. Option 2, did not have proper nutrition, is also incorrect. Proper nutrition does not necessarily mean having all the required elements, because soil can contain plenty of nutrients without being suitable for plants.\n5. Option 3, did not have watered her plants correctly. The term \"correct\" is problematic in this context, as it implies there is a definitive and correct way to water plants. The person might not have been following the best watering practices, but that does not necessarily mean they are in error.\n6. Option 4, the way she watered the plants was in error. This is close but could be misleading, as the way to water could be incorrect, yet correct for the plants.\n7. Option 5, she was doing it wrong. This is the correct answer, as it acknowledges that the problem may not be with the soil, nutrition, or watering but simply with the way the person was doing it.\nAnswer: D, the way she water was in error.\n\nInput: Why does the city provide a bus that runs everyday at 6:40 AM to take people to different places", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": "had what was happening? Choices: 1. A: a rose B: a thorn 2. B: a strawberry C: thistles 3. C: a pumpkin D: grass 4. D: her family\nRationales: Understanding the phrase \"every time she thought she had\" is important in interpreting the question and possible answers. The phrase implies that the subject's attempts to grow a plant were not successful every time she tried. \n1. To answer option A: \"a rose\" would mean that the person had successfully grown a rose, which is not implied by the question. \n2. To answer option B: \"a strawberry\" is not relevant to the statement made about having a green thumb. \n3. To answer option C: \"a pumpkin\" would indicate that the person had successfully cultivated a pumpkin, which is not the specific focus of the question. \n4. In addition, option D may be a potential answer considering that mentioning \"her family\" implies the person may not possess the necessary skills or knowledge to be successful at gardening. \n5. To answer option D: \"grass\" is not an expected answer for someone who is trying to grow plants. \n6. Finally, to answer option D: \"her family\" fits the context, as it represents a factor that may contribute to the person's lack of success in gardening. \n7.

{"text": "had a garden she killed it. What is the type of person she was? Choices: 1: A: patient 2: B: impatient 3: C: rash 4: D: lazy 5: E: inconsistent\nRationales:\n1. The task is to answer the question with choices provided.\n2. First step is to understand the sentence. Patient is not the right answer because the person may appear impatient or rash at times. Also, patient is not used as a synonym of lazy which is why it cannot be the correct answer.\n3. In short, patient doesn't make sense in this context. So, it can be eliminated.\n4. Now check the synonym of patient which is considered impatient. Although impatient does not fit into the sentence it is considered synonym of patient and can be eliminated. Hence, the next option is not patient but impatient.\n5. Next we keep the remaining options. Inconsistent comes in 5 which makes sense but the words used in the sentence do not go well with it. Hence incorrect can be eliminated since it does not fit in the given context.\n6. Now the word rash comes in option 3 also it doesn't make sense. So, there remains three options: A: patient B: impatient C: rash\n7. Next we come to the word lazy which is a synonym of patient. As we know that this doesn't make sense hence lazy can be eliminated too.\n8. So finally we are left with only two choices.  A. B.\n9.

First, we notice a few words and phrase patterns with specific meanings that can help us clarify the meaning. \n\"Sure\" can refer to emphasis or confidence.\n\"Green thumb\" is used to refer to a person or gardener having a natural talent or skill for growing plants successfully. \nNow, consider each of the answer choices and what each is implying.\nA: brown thumb\nThis would be an awkward phrase and doesn't make sense in this context because a brown thumb doesn't make sense as an opposite of a green thumb. \nB: blackish thumb\nThis could mean that the plants are actually blackish. They could simply be dying, or they could be covered in a dark substance. Either way, it's not clear what is meant.\nC: dirt brown thumb\nIt's not clear what the \"dirt brown thumb\" phrase would mean.\nD: muddy brown thumb\nThis has the same problem as the answer B. It's unclear what it would mean.\nE: withered brown thumb This phrase refers to plants going from alive to dead. So, this answer could mean that the plants were killed by neglect, or they received poor care and treatment, which caused them to die off.\nAnswer: D- A muddy brown thumb is what the phrase means.\n\nInput: You can not see if you are happy, do you think being happy is easy? Choices:  T: yes  F: no\nRationales: The first key to correctly answering this question is to interpret the given question. To do this, we need to parse the different sections of the question.\nThe first sentence asks what if you are happy cannot be determined visually or otherwise. This is the question we need to attempt to answer. The second sentence provides information about happiness. It is not easy to be happy.\nSo, how does this apply to the question?

The sentences clearly shows that she's not successful or competent in gardening. \n2. Find out what each of the answer choices means and how it relates to gardening or farming. \n3. \n\n### Demorstration:\n(The lady is not a successful or competent garden)\n\n3. Option A (herb): this is a common plant with medicinal qualities and could be grown and cultivated to obtain these qualities.\n4. Option C (leaf): leaf could be a product of the plant that's grown in a garden. It doesn't mean to grow the whole plant but rather to cultivate the plant. \n5. Option D (plant): plant is a common word in the gardening context and can refer to growing and cultivating various plants or trees.\n6. Option E (flower): flower, in the gardening context, is a product grown to give color, fragrance, or both. Flower is one of the plants or trees that could be grown in a garden to produce those qualities.\n7. Therefore the best answer is D: Plant.\nAnother explanation for answers could be as follows:\nThe sentence refers to someone who doesn't have the skills to successfully grow and farm plants.\n\n1.The lady isn't successful or competent\n\n2. She doesn't have a green (which is an appropriate plant to grow in garden)\n3. She pulls the new leaves\n4. The lady doesn't have any skills and doesn't have experience in gardening\n5. She couldn't grow any (whatever you plant in a garden you should be successful in growing)\n6. She would be unable to grow anything in a garden\n\nAnswer: D: Plant", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "planted flowers, what did they grow up into? Choices:  -: mushrooms A: weeds B: bamboo C: mold D: grass E: trees\nRationales: The first step is to interpret the sentence in terms of the question. It's not about the result of having a green thumb, but rather it's about what plants would be grown in the garden. This makes a lot more sense once we consider the answer choices.\nChoices: A: weeds, B: bamboos, C: molds, D: grass, and E: trees.\nA. Weeds are not an intentional planting; they grow on their own. This is not the type of plant that would need a \"green thumb\" to grow and develop. \nB. Bamboo requires specific growing conditions to thrive, including soil that can hold moisture, a sheltered location, and regular watering. It also needs plenty of sunlight to maintain its form and not fall over. These are not things that would be typically done by someone without a garden.\nC. Mold is not an intentional plant, but rather a fungus that grows in moist, humid conditions. The phrase \"every time she thought she planteds flowers\" suggests that the person did not do so intentionally. Mold, therefore, is not the type of thing they would be planting.\nD. Grass is a common plant that is intentionally grown in gardens, but this is usually done by gardeners with more experience and not by people who are just learning about gardening.\nE. We've already looked at trees and grass; this leaves us with option B: bamboof. Bamboo fits the criteria because it can be grown in various conditions and does not need specific attention or care. Therefore, it is the best option.\nAnswer: B - bamboos\n\nInput: She made a salad while listening to her favorite music, what was she listening to?

{"text": "grew something she found it yellow. Choices:  A. purple B. Orange C. red D. white E. blue\nRationales: Let's start by eliminating options that do not relate to colors. \n1. Purple and orange are colors, just not the color red. \n2. Red, white and blue are colors, just not necessarily those of the choice list.\n3. Red, orange, yellow, and green are all colors. \n4. Moving to the choice set that actually relate to colors. 6. What we know is that the person does not have a green thumb. \n7. Now it looks like the only choices that match the statement are \"yellow\" and \"green\", which both are shades of green. Let's eliminate the \"yellow\" option by understanding the statement of the statement. \n8. \"Yellow\" means \"something a dirty colour shade of yellow\", but we are looking to match the statement, because she wants to grow something green, she can't because it comes back yellow. \n9. Let's assume the person knows that yellow means \"something a dirty colur\". \n10. Now, only option is \"green\" matches the statement because it can be both a color and as long as it is not a \"dirty colur\" it can give a green thumb.\n11.

The phrase \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a green thumb\u201d means that the person wasn\u2019t good at gardening.\nThese options are all examples of planted items.\n1. Roses (A): Roses are plants, but they aren't ones that you commonly or regularly plant. That being said, the odds of someone planting them without killing them is high, so this is an unlikely answer.\n2. Fruits (B): The answer is likely to refer to a fruit tree or plants that typically bears fruit, such as citrus plants or figs. These are most likely to be planted.\n3. Lillies (C): Lilies are plants, but not ones typically planted.\n4. Vegetables (D): Vegetables are plants that you would mostly commonly plant. Many vegetables are also fruit-bearing plants, but this is not always the case.\n5. Flowers (E): Flowers are plants, sometimes fruit-bearing, but this is again not always the case.

{"text": "was doing everything right for her plant she killed it anyway. Choices:  A. had a black thumb C. had a red thumb D. had a blue thumb E. was trying to have a black thumb\nRationales: The phrase \"She sure didn't have...\" indicates that someone has experienced repeated negative events regarding a plant and that the person is currently considering something else as they are now going to try again in another way, but then after another attempt they give up on the plant.\n1. The main point of the passage is to show that it's not about the plant itself, but more about the person who is trying everything and eventually giving up.\n2. Therefore, the person is using a metaphorical green thumb to refer to their skill level and not an actual green thumb of a plant lover.\n3. Let's go through the options available:\na. The person did not have a black thumb. A green thumb is a positive and the person tries to have a green thumb multiple times through various methods.\nb. The person did not try to have a black thumb. This means that the person didn't want to try to have a green thumb which doesn't make sense because that's what they were doing.\nc. The person did not kill the plants and had a red thumb. Even though this is positive and in this case, maybe a plant lover, it does not make any sense because the person had a green thumb which means they tried to have a green thumb.\nd. The person did have had a black thumb, and this doesn't make sense. The person killed the plants, i.e., it's a negative.\ne. The person did try to have a green and had a green thumb. This is actually the correct answer as per the situation.\nAnswer: E.

We are looking for something that a green thumb is good for. Only choices A: plant and B: tend support this: if the thumb is good for planting something, then the thumb would need to be green. \n2.

{"text": "had planted the right plant, it died! What did green thumb mean and where is it located? Choices:  S: hands B: flower C: feet D: brain E: pot\nRationales: First we need to understand what this phrase \"green thumb\" means. \nStep 1: A \"green thumb\" is a person who has special skills or abilities, specifically related to gardening, growing plants, and tending to gardens.\nStep 2: Now we can consider the choices. \nStep 2A: Considering the statement: \"She didn't have a good thumb for planting.\"\nStep 2B: We can eliminate some answers, like hands, feet, and brain (C, D, and E). They do not connect to the concept of gardening or planting, and there is no other reason to use these words in this context.\nStep 2C: Now, when considering plant (S) as an answer, it would make more sense that it's located on your hands or feet.

Choice H, soil, is not relevant. Soil is just the material that grows the plants. It doesn't actually grow the plants. \nChoice F: seedlings is also not applicable because \"the protagonist's plantings\" refers to the person's attempt at cultivating, rather than already-grown plants. Finally, option G: crop makes even less sense. \nThe protagonist is clearly trying to grow flowers and garden plants. \"A blanket of weeds\" suggests that a lot of weeds have overgrown the yard instead of flowers or produce. So, Crop doesn't fit the criteria. \nNow, we try to identify the cause of the problem from the remaining choices. \nOption C, \"she thought she was growing flowers\", does not match the problem. The protagonist wanted to grow plants, not flowers. \nSimilarly, \"plantings\" (Choice B) doesn't match because the protagonist wanted to grow flowers, not just other plant matter. \nThe last choice \"blanket of weeds\" (Choice A) explains what happened, and suggests she intended to plant, not put weeds. \nSo, A: blanket of weeds is the correct answer. \n\nAnswer: A: blanket of flower\n\n### A complete list of question templates and prompts\n\n| Question                                                                      | Answer                                                                       | Rationales                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How do you get to the train station from the market?

She sure knew how to fail. This choice is incorrect as it is not related to a green thumb.\n2. She just wanted to fail every time. This choice is incorrect because it does not capture the idea of learning.\n3. She knew she could always fail. This choice is also incorrect because it has the same meaning as the previous one.\n4. She knew she could never try again. This choice is incorrect for the same reason, as it does not capture the concept of learning.\n5. She just wanted to stay where she is.

This choice is also not correct, as it does not imply the will to learn.\n7. She liked to keep her success rate.

If she couldn' think of making a bouquet, she presumably couldn't clean something either, so choice B is eliminated.

Choice D is incorrect, as anyone can make baked cookies, but you need to know how to make a bouquet to plant a garden. Choice E is then the only choice that fits this puzzle.

The plan here represents a strategy or a solution to a problem or a task.\n2. Option A: soil has nothing to do with a plan. The same goes for option B: the plant and D, water.\n3. Option C: the seeds doesn't really make sense. Seeds do not have a tendency to go \"wrong.

Choices:  Itself, A: tongue B: cheeks C: teeth D: chin E: body hair\nRationales: The first step is to interpret the literal answer choices as in what could cover someone's mouth if it was cold.\n1. The question refers to the mouth, not a person's head, ears or nose. Therefore options A, B, C, and D, although these body parts may be cold, cannot cover someone's mouth.\n2.

Planting plants is an activity not related to the question.\nOption B: The plants\n- The plant doesn't die, it just does what plants do.\nOption C: flowers, this is the same as A, so it can't be the answer.\nOption D: garden, this works. We can understand she didn't have a garden (she didn't water the plants), so this can be the correct answer. It doesn't have to be a literal garden, but a garden could include plants.\nOption E: lawn, just like plants, this doesn't make sense here.\nOption F: grass\n- As with other options, this doesn't seem very real.\nOption G: green thumb.

The sentence implies that the woman in question did grow plants in the past, but that she typically did not succeed. This suggests that she lacked success with plants, or she had a \"green thumb.\" \nSecond, understand the answer choices. The other choices can be eliminated quickly because they don't make sense. \nStarting with choice A: having a green thumb doesn't make much sense here. It doesn't make sense that she succeeded in growing a plant in the past, but failed to grow a plant whenever she tried in the future.\nSimilarly, choice B: not having a thumb doesn't make sense because it implies she did not have any of the necessary muscular structures for growing plants.\nChoice D: killing it, while it can mean to actually kill the plant, can also mean to be unsuccessful in growing it. This makes sense in the context and is a likely answer.\nChoice E: trying to plant it. While it's possible that she didn't have a good understanding of how to properly plant a plant, that's not really the issue. The issue is that she typically did not grow the plant regardless of what she tried.\nNow we can consider choice C: planting it. This is the only option that may mean something different or make sense in the context aside from choice D. However, choice C doesn't make a lot of sense. If a person tries a lot but fails, then the correct answer is choice D. \nTherefore, the correct answer is choice C: planting, as it means that the person tried a little or somewhat to plant the plant but failed or was unsuccessful.  \nAnswer: C: planting\n\nInput: What did the man give you if you were buying a toy for your child?

A crop is a plant that is grown and cultivated for food, fiber, or other purposes. A cucumber is a vegetable that is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, usually pickled.\nFingernails are the hardened tissue at the end of the fingers that typically appear on all humans and almost every other mammal. A dog is a domesticated animal, typically a canine, that is trained and used for various purposes including hunting, protection, and companionship. A green thumb is a popular idiomatic expression that means one is able to grow plants successfully, especially trees, shrubs, and flowers. It's used as a compliment, meaning that the person has an innate ability to grow plants, making them skilled in gardening and horticulture.\nThe question refers to a situation where the woman tries to grow a crop but fails, most likely due to her lack of gardening skills.\n8. Consider the answer choices. There are 3 possibilities of what could have caused the plants to die: \n9. (A) crop. A crop can mean a wide variety of plants, but in this context, the answer choice indicates that the person in question is trying to grow a crop and fails.\n10. (B) cucumber. Cucumbers are typically not planted for crop purposes, so the answer choice is not relevant to the sentence as it stands.\n11. (C) fingernails. This would not fit grammatically as the phrase is \"every time she thought she grew\", not \"every time she grew\" fingernails.\n12. (D) dog. The sentence is referring to a specific crop, indicating that it's not possible for the phrase to fit a dog.\n13. (E) green thumb.

E: The question is asking about plants, not a garden, so \"she hadn't weeded out the weeds\" would be unnecessary.  \nThe correct answer is C: the person couldn't identify pests because the plants died.  Identifying pests is crucial for gardening and could be an important skill for a gardening fanatic, so neglecting to identify pests could result in repeated failure to produce a healthy plant.  \nAnswer: C: The water bill was too expensive.", "answer": " 400"}

We will use our critical thinking skills to determine the answer.\nStep 1: Consider the phrase \"She sure didn' have a green thumb.\" This indicates that the person does not have good gardening skills.\nStep 2: Next, look at each alternative answer choice to determine what it means and how it relates to the phrase \"green thumb\" being evaluated.\nStep 3: Choice A: green thumb can literally mean a green thumb. In context, it means good or great gardening and gardening skills. This is the right answer.\nChoice B: green leaf is not related to \"green thumb.\"\nChoice C: green hair is also not related to \"green\" thumb.\nChoice D: green light is not related to \"a green thumb.\"\nChoice E: green grass could be a good answer choice, but it refers to grassy fields, not to a \"green thumb\".\nIn summary, the correct answer is A: green thumb.\nAnswer: A green Thumb \nInput: He got into a good amount of trouble.

The other answer choices are either not related to the missing element or cannot be deduced from the sentence alone. It is essential to read and critically think about the sentence to determine the correct answer choice. \nAnswer: He will be missing.\nInput: Do you want a shoe that is good, reliable.

Now, consider the other answers and what makes a good response. \n2. \"F. she put on too little food\". We must now check each answer to see if it fits the request.\n3. \"B: watering it well\". The question implies that the plants are dying, so good watering wouldn't lead to this. \n4. \"A: watering it well\", is also incorrect. If she watered it well, it would still die, so it's not the reason.\n5. \"E: putting on too little food\". This seems like the most likely answer, so it must be the correct one. \n6. \"B: put on too little food\": the person is putting too little food as they cannot water well and would die.

Each answer choice represents a potential problem that could happen when growing plants.\n2. A: animals eat them. It's possible that animals could eat the newly sprouted plants, but the sentence does not explicitly state that they did this.\n3. B: the rainfal is too much for the garten. Rainfall can cause drowning, which could be a possible issue when growing plants, but the sentence only asks about what happens every time she thinks she's growing good plants.\n4. C: the sun light is too strong for the garten. Similar to rainfall, sunlight can cause plants to wither or die, which could be a potential issue when growing plants. However, the sentence only asks about something that happens when she thinks she is growing good plants.\n5. D: she did not take care for the garten plants correctly.

{"text": "tried to plant the flowers, what happened? Choices: 1. A: rain 2. B: lightning 3. C: squirrels 4. D: herbicide 5. E: hail\nRationales: There are quite a few possible scenarios, so it's important to consider each option in the context of the question. \n1. The phrase \"She sure didn't have\" is a sentence fragment. The author is most likely using it to indicate a lack of proficiency or expertise in a particular skill or activity. \n2. The phrase \"She didn't have\" would still be a sentence fragment, so the author has probably intentionally excluded it from the options as a deliberate choice. \n3. The options that begin with \"1. A: rain\" and \"1. B: lightning\" are too literal. \n4. The options that begin from \"2. A: squirrels,\" \"2. B: herbicide,\" and \"2. C: hail,\" are more suitable as they are likely caused by other events and can represent a failure to grow or maintain plants.\n5. Although she may have had difficulty when attempting to grow plants, she presumably has tried at some point in the past, leading to the conclusion of \"every time.\" \n6. If this is the case, \"2. C: squirrels\" may be the best option, as squirrels are known for eating plant seeds and burrowing in the garden soil. \n7. If the gardener's plants were growing too slowly, she might use herbicide to speed up the process, so \"2. A: herbicide\" may be the correct choice.\n8. Given that her gardening skills apparently haven't improved over time, it's more likely that the gardener has used an herbicide to keep the plants looking healthy, rather than to help them grow faster. \n9. Furthermore, it's not clear whether her garden plants have been successfully growing, which would suggest that \"2. B: rain\" may be the answer. \n10. Finally, we can consider \"2. R: Hail\" as a possibility, and we'll note that it may be possible there were attempts at planting, but no evidence of growth.", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "was helping, she actually killed the plant. She did what? Choices: 1: overwatered it 2: sprayed insecticide 3: moved it too often 4: cut back the stems 5: bought dirt.\nRationales: The question asks us to determine the most likely reason the plant was killed. \n1. The first choice that can be eliminated from the list is option 1: overwatering. The sentence indicates that the woman was attempting to help the plant, but instead they killed it. \n2. We can then move on to option 2: sprayed it insecticide. This may seem like a valid reason to kill a plant, however, this would suggest that she was intentionally harming the plant. \n3. We can discard option 3: it was moved too often. \n4. Option 4: cutting back the leaves. The phrase \"did what\" indicates that there may be multiple actions involved in the process of the killing of the plant. \n5. Option 5: bought dumb. If anything would have caused the plant to die, it would most likely be the dumbness of the soil or dirt. \n6. Hence we can conclude that the most likely answer from the options is #4: cutting back the stems. \nAnswer: 4: cutting back stems.\n\nInput: She is from 1921, how will she get her groceries?

We will eliminate options 6: bicycles 7: phone \n2. Now we will look the remaining options 8: motor vehicle, 9: boat \n\n3. We can eliminate option 8: motor vehicle because that would be something she might drive to get groceries today but not from 1928. \n\n4.

Choices: \tA: being treated fairly B: good news C: good luck D: health E: success\nRationales: What makes a person feels like they are on top the world is a statement you can use for an action of a specific person. It should explain their actions of how they act as if they\u2019re on top of the world.\n\n1. Being treated fairly - A is incorrect because in that situation you wouldn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re on top of world.\n2. Good news - B is incorrect because you would not act like you\u2019re on the top of the world if there is good news.\n3.

The living room and couch\nRationales: Here are some strategies that we can use to answer this question. 1. First of all, if we look for the pattern of calling in this problem, we can see that the caller of a living room and couch are all similar. So, if one of the options looks similar to one of this, it could be the answer.\n2. This problem asks about the pattern of calling in different room or locations which is in the kitchen, the living room, and the couch and the caller, the two of them are calling one person. So, if one person calls another person in different rooms or locations, it could be similar to a phone call.\n3. The couch and refrigerator. A is an option that the person is calling at the refrigerator, not at the couch, it is not similar to the phone call. \n4. The couch and chair.

Choices:  A. die B. become dead C. will die D. would've died E. would die\nRationales: First, we understand the question. It asks us to choose from a list of possible outcomes the one that would be most likely to occur after certain actions or events. When considering \"actions or events,\" it helps to separate them into two categories: before the action/event and after the action/event. \n\nWe start with before the action/event by considering each option for its potential consequences.\n\nAnswer Choice A (die): This option indicates that something will die (or has already died) as a result of certain actions or events.\n\nAnswer Choices B (become dead) and D (would've died): These options suggest that death is a result of certain actions/events, but they do not answer the question. Death is a physical state; it cannot \"become dead\" after a certain point. It's either present or absent.\n\nFor the after situation, consider the outcomes of each answer choice, considering their consequences.\n\nAnswer choice C (will die) suggests that death will occur due to the actions and events. However, \"will\" implies a future point in time, which the author clearly indicates has already happened with the simple phrase \"every time she thought she was gonna get better...\"\n\nAnswer choice E (would die) indicates it is a result of actions/events occurring at some unspecified point in time. It does not fit well with the phrasing of the question, so it would be rejected.\n\nAnswer Choise B (become dead): This is a potential state of being that could be the result of certain actions/actions, but it is not an event that could have occurred once already.\n\nAnswer A (die): It is a specific outcome resulting from an already present, actual situation.

Choices: A: compass B: protractor C: calculator D: ruler E: GPS\nRationales: We first want to find out what the question is asking about, and this means interpreting the terms \"exact position\" and the term \"the map\".\n1. \"exact position\" can have multiple possible meanings:\n  1. (a) precise position (b) accurate position, (c) exact location, (d) specific location, (e) specific coordinates of a place, and\n  2. (f) precise measurement (g) accurate measurement (h) exact measurement (i) specific measurement (j) specific data about measurement.\n2. So, from choice A, compass, we know it's not about (d) specific location or (e) specific coordinates, and from (f) specific measurement we know it's neither (a) precise position nor (h) exact measurement.\n3. Then, from choices B, C, D and E, we can eliminate (a) accurate, (b) precise, (c) precise, (d) specific, (e) specific, (f) precise, (g) exact, (h) exact and (j) specific.\n4. So, (i) specific measurement is the only option that can satisfy the meaning of \"exact position\", leaving us with choice B, protractor (which means the instrument used to draw or measure circles).\n5.

A yellow or brown plant would indicate a lack of vigor or health, not a lack of green-thumbedness.\n4. The only answer option that fits the criteria is therefore E. blue.\n5.

The first step of solving the problem is to understand the task at hand. The main goal is to answer the question: \" what was the teacher wearing?\"\n2. The second step is to break down the question by evaluating the given information, and understanding how it can help guide you towards the answer. We know that the teacher couldn't see the way because she was wearing a blindfold. We also know that she could see some students.\n3.

The first step in answering this question is to understand the possible answer choices. The question makes it clear that the answer choices represent possible explanations for why she didn't have a \"green thumb.\"\n2. The second step is to consider each option and determine if it makes sense based on the information given. It's important not to guess or make assumptions about the answer, but to base your decision on facts and reasoning you have from the given information.\n3. The correct answer is B: She didn't make enough time. This is the best choice because it's the most logical and makes the most sense when considering the given information.\n\n(1. She had a purple, black, or green thumb. This would mean she was skilled or good at gardening or plant care, which is the opposite of what is implied in the question. This is not the correct answer.)\n(2. She could not make plants grow. This would mean she had a lack or issue with plant growth, which is not reflected in the question.

{"text": "planted one, a flower would rise instead of a tree. Choices:  A. tree B. rose C. grass D. bush E. grass\nRationales: In the given scenario we have a person with a flower plant, not a tree. The key here is to recognize the difference between a \"flower\" and a \"tree\". \n1. Step 1: Eliminate options that are not correct.\n2. If \"rose\" was given, we wouldn't be looking for a flower and we would already know the wrong choice. \n3. Eliminate \"rose\", this choice is a flower instead of a tree. \n4. \"Bush\" is a type of plant that is usually smaller than a tree, not a tree. So eliminate \"bush\" as it is not a tree.  \n5. \"Grass\" will not grow a tree and is often a type of surface or ground. Eliminate \"grass\", as it is not a choice that will grow a tree. \n6. Let's analyze \"grass\" again. By evaluating the choice of \"grass\", we understand that it is also incorrect because it is in the wrong place. In a plant or vegetable garden, one does not generally need to plant grass as other plant varieties already exist and provide adequate coverage. Therefore, this choice is not a tree. \n7. Let's consider \"tree\" as the only possible choice left. Let's test this choice against the given details to further confirm it's correctness:\n8. Let's summarize our analysis:\na. The last line \"a flower would rise instead of the tree\" provides additional knowledge that the person expected to plant a tree but instead had to be satisfied with a flower. That is to say \"tree\" is a plant that is supposed to grow. If grass had been planted, that would not have been satisfactory. The implication here is that the plant should be a \"tree\" but in fact it is not a tree and \"flowered\" instead. \n9. Therefore, \"tree\" is the correct answer. \nAnswer: Tree", "answer": " 72"}
{"text": "grew a vegetable, it died Choices:  A green thumb B green vegetable C green apple D green grass E vegetable Died\nRationales: The question gives us the following information: 1. She didn't have a \"green thumb\", the term for someone who is very skillful with gardening. 2. Whatever she grew in the garden \"died\". 3. A vegetable could mean almost anything from a garden, so we should also consider options A: green thumb, B: green vegetable, and C: green apple and D: green grass.\n4. \"Green thumb\" is a good choice as it's synonymous to \"gardening skill\", but it doesn't imply any failed gardening attempts or failure to grow a vegetable.\n5. \"Green vegetable\" is also a good choice, as it could simply mean a vegetable with greenish tint, so it's technically true. The phrase \"thought she grew\" could mean that she made various attempts but couldn't succeed, so this could be considered.\n6. If we eliminate one of the two options with \"green\", we may rule out the correct choice, so we need to keep them both.\n7. \"Green apple\" and \"green grass\" are not good choices as they seem out of place when considering \"every time\".\n8. \"Green apple\" is not a good option as it would imply the person grew a green apple with gardening skills; this goes against the given information. \"Green grass\" is also not a good option as the phrase \"every time\" would imply multiple trials, and green grass cannot really be grown multiple times.\n9. Therefore the best choice is B: green vegetable as this most accurately describes the situation described in the question.\nAnswer: B green vegetable\n\nInput: The students did what in math class and passed the test?

{"text": "had something nice to take pride in she ended up finding it in the dirt Choices:  A green thumb B: take pride in C: ended up D: something nice E: find it in the dirt\nRationales: The question asks if she had a green thumb or not. 1. Start with the first option: A: a green thumb. We have to figure out what a green thumb is and how well does the given sentence describes the meaning of that particular word. 2. The green thumb would be a good answer only if she actually had one green thumb, not green grass or green paint or anything else. \n3. Now moving on to the second option: B: take pride in. The sentence clearly states that there was something nice. What if there is something nice that she took pride in?. We would have to compare the two options and find out. 4. Option D: something nice. This could very well be the answer. Something nice is a green thumb indeed, so she can take pride in that. 5. Option E: find that in the dirt. The sentence mentions that she would end up finding it in the mud or dirt. It is clear that if she thought she had nice things like a green thumb, she would definitely find it and take pride in that. Only the choice D: something nice is the correct answer Choices B: take pride in and E: find it in dirt does not fit the context of the given sentence.\nAnswer: D The answer is D: something nice", "answer": " 38"}
{"text": "had to plant a tree, she would just have to choose someone else to do it. Choices:  A. green B. brown C. gray D. white E. black\nRationales: First, understand the question is asking \"she sure didn\u2019t have a green thumb\" what does this mean. \nIt is usually related to the inability of her to grow or take care of plants. \nSince we already figured this out, we can now move on to the second step, which is to identify the answer choices and eliminate the incorrect ones using reasoning.\nChoice option A. Gray is unlikely to be correct as gray isn\u2019t a part of the question phrase, while the rest of them do. \nChoice option B: Brown is slightly more ambiguous, but this shouldn\u2019t stop us from eliminating it either as the majority of the others are more likely to be correct.\nSimilar reasoning for Choice option C.

Choices:  a. went out with friends b. ate with others c. ate alone d. partied with his buddies e. went for a walk\nRationales: Now, we are left with the final step which is to combine all the choices with the question phrase and pick between the possible options according to your judgment.\nThis is how we go: \"His girlfriend just broke up with him, so he...\" Now, look at the options:\nA went out with friends, b ate with others, c ate alone: These are all things that can be done by one individual and do not involve having company.\nPartied with buddies: Party is associated with people more than one and a walk: \"Walking at the park is actually a lot of fun\". \nGoing for a walk does not require other people to be present which makes it unlikely to be the correct answer.\nTherefore between A to D, the only option that fits best is C. \"Ate alone, we all know that this implies being by oneself and eating in isolation\".\nAnswer: C.

{"text": "had planted what she thought it would flower into something else it became Choices:  A-rose B-carrot C-pea D-tree E-potato\nRationales: First, it's important to understand the context of the question. The question is about a gardener and her garden. \n1. The gardener did not have a green thumb. This means that she was not good at gardening and most likely had difficulties growing plants in the past.\n2. Every time the gardener thought she had planted something and it would flower, it became something else. This indicates a level of confusion or misunderstanding in the gardener's mind when it comes to what she intended to grow and what actually grew.\n3. It is possible that the gardener thought she was planting one thing and it turned out to be another, but this would most likely be due to a mistake or forgetfulness and could be explained with the word \"instead.\" \n4. However, from the given options, only one choice fits the intended meaning of the sentence - A: rose, B: carrot, C: pea, and D: tree. \n5. Rose (A), pea (C), and carrot (B) could all be plants that may have mistakenly turned into something else. Tree (D) is not a likely answer as it is likely to turn into something else but in a different way.\n6. Therefore, A: rose B: carrot C: pea D: tree E: potato. E: Potato cannot be the answer as potato does not fit the context or meaning of the given options, even though it is a correct statement. \n7. Hence, the answer based on the meaning of \"would flower\" and the intended meaning would be A: Rose.\nAnswer: A Rose\n\nInput: What time could you be late?

{"text": "was helping things actually hurt the plant. Choices:  A green thumb B red thumb C white thumb D thumb\nRationales: First, let's look at the options that don't make sense. Option A: green thumb does not make sense since you want green things to thrive. Option B: red thumb does not make sense because you want red things to thrive.\nOption C: white thumb makes no sense because white things are usually associated with snow and ice which can cause destruction rather than growth. Therefore, we can eliminate these three options.\nNext, we need to find which option correctly describes the word thumb and make sure that option matches.\nOption D: thumb does not make sense as a thumb is not a color.\nWe need one option left to use to narrow down our search. That option would be option C: white thumb.\nIf we use that as our one word that describes or has a relation to thumb, we could compare it to the other remaining words green, red, and d:\nOption E: green - thumb and green are not in relation.\nOption F: red - thumb and red are not in relation. Option E: d - thumb and d, or dumb are not in relation. So, the correct answer is choice C white thumb.\nAnswer: C.

Choices:  a) sit by a fire b) stay up late c) work d) clean e) travel\nRationales: The sentence \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have a \u2018good\u2019 time\u201d could mean that they are purposely avoiding being happy or enjoying themselves during the holiday. \nHowever, a \u2018good\u2019 time does not necessarily mean positive. \nSo, we should eliminate choice A \u201csit by a fire\u201d, because one would have a good time sitting by a fire.\nSimilarly, choices C \u201cstay up late\u201d, D \u201cclean\u201d and E \u201ctravel\u201d are also ruled out because it implies happy, positive feelings, thus ruling out the last three. \nHence, choice B \u201cwork\u201d is the correct answer as it means \u2018doing your job\u2019 without enjoying the process or the result, which fits the context of not wanting to have a \u2018good time\u2019 on the holiday.

Choices:  A:: water B: feed C :sun D: weed E: pests\nRationales: First, interpret the question asking what happens every time the person tries to grow fruit. The person isn't doing something, but their plants do something; the plants start to droop. \n1. Next, consider each answer choice. \n2. Starting with A: water. This does not fit the meaning of every time because plants are living organisms capable of sustaining themselves with minimal to no external interference. They can survive with water and lack of care, so no one has to water the plants all the time. \n3. Moving on to B: feed. This may not be relevant to the plants; it only makes sense if the plants need feeding in some way.\n4. Considering C: sun. The question doesn't use the word \"sunlight\", so a response that requires sunlight to be accurate is unlikely.\n5. Movement on to D: weed. This is a related answer as weeds can be considered pests, but we don't know if it's a common response to weeding that brings about droops. \n6. Reasonable choice now is E: pests. Pests could be an issue because they could be the cause of the plants drooping or because they could harm the plants in other ways. \n7. Hence, pests are a suitable answer for the question, so the correct answer is E: Pests.\nAnswer: E : pests", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "took care of plant, which is in a pot, how would it look like in the end of day? Choices: \nA: it died B: it was beautiful C: it withered D: it was yellow E: it was drowns\nRationales: Option A: it died. A green thumb is something that implies the ability of having a green thumb. If a person had a green thumb, their plant would likely be more beautiful, would not wither, and would not die. Therefore, option A: it died could not be the answer. \nOption B: it was beautiful. In the question, 'it had died' isn't used as we understand that the flower/plant has passed on. Therefore, option B: it was beautiful wouldn't be grammatically correct here given the context.  \nOption C: is withered. A green thumb is a person who is skilled in giving care and attention to the plants or making them thrive. Therefore, if a person had a green/golden/beautiful thumb, the plant would not likely be wither. Option C: is withered isn't an answer.\nOption D: it was yellow. It may sound bizarre to assume that a green thumb is given for growing a plant that is yellow. Option D: it was yellow doesn't describe a plant given a green thumb. Option D: it is yellow is incorrect.  \nOption E: it was drown. If the person didn't have a plant for a green thumb, then option E: it is drown is incorrect. Moreover, we do not know whether or not the plant was actually on a pot.\nOption C: is a withered, option D: it is yellow, and option E: it is dead are all incorrect based on the context of the question.  \nOption C & D states that no green thumb is being shown and option E: it was dead is stating the plant did not live at all.  \nTherefore, the answer is C & D: it is withered, which means that the plant died, despite all the efforts and care.  \nAnswer: C & D: it was withered\n\nInput: At what time does it usually begin the day?

Choices:  A. didn't water the plants enough B. had nothing planted C. didn't put down any fertilizer D. didn't weed the garden E. didn't harvest all the crops last year\nRationales: The question asks us to identify a reason why someone might have a poor track record of planting and growing a garden. \nThe answer should represent a common cause of failure to grow a garden successfully. \nWe consider each option: \n1. \u201cDidn\u2019t water the plants enough\u201d could be true, but it seems like a far less likely circumstance than the one mentioned here, which may indicate a broader issue with the process that needs to be addressed. \n2. \u201cNothing was planted\u201d is not likely because a decision to not plant anything is not likely to lead to this particular challenge. \n3. \u201cDidn\u2019tt put down any fertilizers\u201d could be true but seems too specific and focused on one solution which is unlikely to represent the whole problem. \n4. \u201cDidn\u2019 t weed the garden\u201d is certainly possible, but again seems too specific and focused.\n5. Choice E: \u201cDidn\u2019t harvest all the crop last year\u201d is a reasonable cause of why someone would have a poor track record when growing a garden. 6. People who leave crops in the ground, particularly ones that are expected to be harvested for consumption, are more likely to be eaten by animals. 7. Therefore, the best choice here is  E: \n\u201cDoesn\u2019t harvest crops fully in the past.\u201d It is a likely contributor to the problem being discussed where the gardener failed to maintain a garden due to a failure to harvest.\nAnswer: E \" Doesn't harvest crops full in the past\"", "answer": " 570"}
{"text": "could cook anything, Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales: This is a common error. It\u2019s important to look at what the question is asking, as it might indicate a common pattern or clue that can be used to answer the question. The given sentence suggests that the person being described did not always have good results when trying to cook food. Therefore, the answer might also have a negative connotation as well.\n1. First, we look at the remaining part of the sentence \u2013 \"every time she though she could cook anything\u2026\"\n2. Now we consider the remaining answer choices. \n3. A: green thumb. A green thumb is generally associated with gardening and other outdoor activities related to plants. So, it does not match with the pattern in the sentence. \n4. B: not have a green thumb. This is the opposite of having a green thumb and matches with the pattern in the given sentence. \n5. C: She didn't have a red thumb. This is slightly different from the pattern in the sentence and might indicate an uncommon answer.\n6. E: Every time I thought you couldn't cook anything\u2026 The pattern in this sentence is wrong and the answer should be one that matches the original pattern.\n7. Therefore the answer is B: not have a red thumb.\nAnswer: B B: not have a read thumb\n\nInput: They didn't have to do that, they had what to handle? Choices: 1 A B C 2\nRationales: A B C D This is an error that often occurs when trying to determine the answer to a question. It's essential to evaluate the entire question before making an answer choice and not just the first few words. The sentence contains the word \"didn't\" which indicates that the answer will represent a contrast or negation to what is stated.\n1. Step 1: understand the context and the meaning of the question. \n2. Step 2: determine the meaning of the word \"that\", which refers to a specific item or thing. \n3. Step 3: determine what kind of object \"they had\" which refers to an item or idea that could be a valid answer. \n4. Now we look at each of the given answer choices: \n5. A: They had to do that.

{"text": "was doing what, Choices:  A going to feed her cat B tending her yard C planting D giving away flowers E playing baseball\nRationales: The problem sentence is \"She sure didn't have green thumb, every time (she) thought she was doing something.\"\n1. The question asks what the person believes she is doing, but it seems she isn't actually doing what she thinks she is doing.\n2. \"Planting\" does not match the wording \"every time she thought she was (doing something),\" which suggests the person is making an incorrect assumption.\n3. \"Tending her yard\" is possibly something the person has done in the past. 4. \"Giving away flowers\" might be something the person intends to do in the future. \n4. \"Playing baseball\" is not related to anything done or intended in the sentence as the phrase \"every time she thought\" does not indicate who the person is or \"what she was doing.\"\n5. The answer is A: going to feed her cat. This phrase does not imply any past or future actions, but the person's mistaken belief that they are planting flowers.\nAnswer: A; going to feed her cat\n\nInput: What does the individual say, the individual who is the one causing problems?

We look for possible answer choices that can follow the structure of what the individual would say.\n2. Option A: \"that's wrong\" does not match with the rest of the sentence. It would be grammatically incorrect to say, \"That's wrong; (the) individual who is the one(,) who is causing problems..\"\n3. Options B, C and D can be ruled out as their structures do not match the sentence structure as above. \n4. Option E does not match, either, since the individual is the one causing problems, and the individual could also say \"it's right\" or \"it's the best thing.\" \n5.

{"text": "planted what did she have to dig up? Choices:  B: gardenia  B: zucchini  C: tomato  C: weed  D: potato  D: onion  E: radish  E: carrot\nRationales: We start by understanding the question correctly. Specifically, we need to understand what each part of the sentence refers to.\n1. She sure didn't - this sentence modifies or qualifies an action being done by someone. 2. Didn't have a green - this phrase means \"did not have a healthy or successful planting\" 3. Didn't - qualifies the previous phrase and is used to connect them. 4. Have a - is a subject phrase indicating that this action should be the focus.\n5. Now that we know how the sentence is constructed, we can read through each option and eliminate those that are not suitable.\n6. Option A: gardenia does not fit the qualifiers in the sentence. It can be described as fragrant, but this is not specifically related to planting.\n7. Option B: zucchni is related to planting, but it isn't something one might have to dig up after planting.\n8. Option C: tomato is a likely fit, but \"she sure did have\" means the person had some in the past, not necessarily that they're still present.\n9. Option D: potato: This can be dug up after planting, making it a plausable answer. \n10. Option E: carrot: This is also a possible answer, as this root vegetable can be dug up, making it planting related, and something one may have to dig up as a result of planting.\n11.

Option C: rose bushes could be planted together as they would typically require the same care and environment. Choice D: grass is planted all over the ground, so it's unlikely that it was meant to be planted in the area around the rose bushes. \n3.

The wrong kind of soil: incorrect usage of soil could render our plants unhealthy, but the use of the wrong kind of soil is not an absolute requirement for having a dried out plant.\n2. The wrong amount of light: We can cross out this option for the same reason.\n3. The wrong kind of water: We can cross out for the same reason. \n4. Didn't have enough sun: This could be a valid reason, but it\u2019s not enough to determine the answer, leaving D: didn't do enough sun.\n5. Didn't use the best fertilizer: This could be the correct answer, but again, we don\u2019t have enough information to determine that by considering all the available choices. We only know that \"she sure didn't have... a green thumb.\"\nSo the list of remaining  choices reduces to \n1. She didn't do enough of something\n2. The wrong kind of... that she was applying\n3.

{"text": "planted a flower, it would die. Choices:  A green thumb B: yellow flower C: planted something else D: dead flower E: yellow thumb\nRationales: This question can be solved by considering the meaning of each answer choice.\n\n1. \"A green thumb\" suggests someone who has great ability to gardening or has success in growing plants, so this is not the answer.\n2. Plants can die for many reasons, including over-watering, lack of sunlight, or pests, none of which fit the scenario presented in the question. Thus, this choice cannot be the correct answer.\n3. The term \"yellow flower\" might refer to a flower that has yellow petals or a flower that is yellow in color, but it could also refer to a flower with a stalk that is yellow in color. It would be best to try to avoid assuming the meaning of the \"yellow flower\" and instead focus on examining other choices.\n4. \"Planting something else\" could imply that the person who does not have a green thumb planted something other than a flower. For example, they could have planted herbs or vegetables instead of flowers. This could also be seen as a hint towards the correct choice, but we need to confirm this with the following answer choices.\n5. \"Dead flower\" has a literal meaning that fits the scenario. The person who has a green thumb would be unlikely to think of flowers as being dead because they are plants that thrive and grow, not die. So, this choice has a high possibility of being the correct one.\n6. \"Yellow thumb\" is a term sometimes used to describe someone who has difficulty gardening and often encounters difficulties with plants.

Choices:  A:\"might have accidentally poisoned\" B: \"didn't know much about\"  C: \"was killing the plant\" D: \"flooded the pot\" E: \"was causing an allergy\"\nRationales:\n1. First, understand that the answer \"was causing an allergen\" does sound close to the original statement, but this is not the correct answer because there is no evidence of any plant suffering from an allergy.\n2. The key to this task is in understanding the concept of the expression \"green thumb.\" This phrase is often used to describe someone with an innate skill or talent for gardening or maintaining plants, and indicates a high degree of knowledge and expertise in the field.\n3. To solve this task, it's necessary to determine what is incompatible with the skill of \"green thumb.\"\n4. Consider each option one at a time.\n5. \"Accidentally poisoned\" (Choice A) could imply an inexperienced gardener trying to keep a plant alive and unknowingly using a toxic substance to keep it well-fed. However, this does not describe the full concept of \"green thumb.\" Toxic substances could accidentally poison the plant, but a person with a green thumb would be experienced and knowledgeable enough to avoid these mistakes.\n6. \"Didn't know much\" (Choice B) is also not an accurate representation of \"green thumb.\" If someone didn't know much about gardening, they wouldn't be considered to have a green thumb, regardless of whether they accidentally poisoned a plant or not.\n7. \"Was killing the plant\" (Choice C) could be a possible answer. However, it is problematic because it's not necessarily the person's fault and is more of an inevitable consequence of nature taking its course. It doesn't accurately represent the inherent skill and ability of a \"green thumb.\"\n8. \"Flooded the pot\" (Choice D) could be a possible solution, but this would be a result of a lack of experience and could be resolved through learning and practice.

However, the phrase \u201ccruciferous veggies, carrots, and radishes\u201d indicates that the person had trouble growing specific types of plants.\n\nChoices B, garden, is a likely answer, as it refers to a place where plants are grown. However, the phrase  \u201cwere inedible\u201d suggests that the person\u2019s garden did not contain any fruitful plants.\n\nChoice D, pets, is an unlikely answer as pets are not plants, and the person\u2019s inability to grow plants indicates a lack of ability, not a desire.\n\nChoices C, tree, and E, cactus, are both possible answers.

Choices:  - A: jumped onto it - B: hid from it - C: killed it - D: tried to get a toy from it\nRationales: We have to look at the context of the story and the language used by the original writers to interpret the answer.\n\n- Choice A: jumped onto the cat. Jumping onto the cat may be the action of the bird, but it's unlikely to be the answer to the question, as this would not necessarily do harm to the mouse.\n- Choice B: hide from the cat. This may be an action that the bird takes to avoid the cat, but it's still not the answer to the question as it does not necessarily deal with harm towards the mouse.\n- CHOICE C: kills the mouse. The phrase \"kills the mouse\" indicates that the bird does harm to the mouse, making it a possible answer.\n- Choice D: tries to get a toy. The phrase \"tries to get a toy\" implies that the bird is interacting with the mouse in some way, which doesn't make sense", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "was watering the plants only had brown thumbs! Choices:  A-C: B-D:\n\nRationales: To understand the sentence, we need to first focus on the meaning of \"every time she thought she was.\" This phrase suggests that although her intention may be good, she is not actually performing the task correctly. \nThis is a key factor to consider when choosing the correct answer. \n1. Option A: The plant is being over-watered. This could be true, as over-watering can brown the leaves of a plant and cause them to look dry. \n2. Option B: The plant is being under-watered. This is also possible, as brown leaves may indicate a plant needs more water. \n3. Taking into account the context and the meaning of \"everytime\", an over-watered plant seems less likely.\n4. So, there is insufficient information to confidently choose one of these option, and the answer choice might be both A and B. \n5. Option D: The plant is being starved of light. This can result in brown leaves or a browning of the plant overall.\n6. This option seems to make the most sense as the cause of the dry, brown plants. We can't eliminate either A or B, but D makes the answer more likely.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: The plant is not getting enough light.\nAnswer: D.

Determine the answer choices: A: make her happy, B: Cause frustration, C: Make her feel defeated, D: prevent her from trying, E: Make her stop. \n2. Consider each option: 3. A: makes her happy. This is one of the most basic and obvious responses that makes no sense, and so, we eliminate it. 4. B: Cause frustrations. This may be the best answer, but it does not directly answer the question. The question asks what every time she thought she'd succeed, the flower would do. By just asking for her thoughts, it doesn't mean it would change the response. 5. C: Makes her feel defeated. This is possible, but the question asks for every time she thought she succeeded, the flower would die, which is what she did not think before she did it. 6. D: Prevented her from trying. This is the most logical option, since her not succeeding could be the result of her not doing anything.\n7. E: Makes her stop.

{"text": "grew something she accidentally let it die. Choices:  A. not enough sunlight B. too much shade C. she let it wither D. she didn't water it E. she didn't fertilize it.\nRationales: When given a question such as this, it can be helpful to break it down into more manageable components.\n1. First, we want to determine what exactly the phrase \"she didn't have a \"green thumb\" could mean. The word \"green\" in this phrase refers to growing plants or plants that are thriving. Hence, the phrase \"she didn\u2019t have a green thumb\" means that she was not growing plants properly because she wasn\u2019t properly caring for them.\n2. Now, look at each of the answer options.\n3. What type of care does one need to give for a plant to be healthy, strong, and grow well? One needs enough sunlight, good watering, fertilization, and protection from cold or harsh weather conditions. \n4. Starting with the first option, \u201cA: not enough sunlight\u201d. The fact that she was growing something but accidentally letting it die doesn\u2019t say enough about how it\u2019s grown. It says enough about the conditions under which it grows, but more about what she\u2019s doing to ensure that her plants grow well and not about what might go wrong.\n5. Next choice is \u201cB. too much shade\u201d. The fact that she accidentally let her plants die doesn\u2019t indicate whether or not there was enough sunlight to grow the plants, as it might indicate that there was not sufficient light shining on the plants. Again, this answer option doesn\u2019t give us any information about what she did.\n6. Another option is \u201cC. she let it withered\u201d. The fact that she let her plants die doesn't automatically mean that she did not try to prevent that. For example, she might have watered them too little or too frequently, exposed them to cold or harsh weather, or not used enough fertilizer. \n7. The fourth option is \u201cD. she didn't do it\". This answer describes the same situation as the first two, but doesn't explain how she tried to grow them. \n8. Last one is \u201cE. she didn't give it any fertilizer.

{"text": "was done her plants died, and she even had a black thumb. Choices:  A. white, B. brown, C: red, d: yellow, E. green\nRationales: Option A would be the logical answer, as the phrase, \"every time she thought she was,\" is in the present tense and she had not yet died.\nOption B: white. Would not be a plausible answer because the phrase, \"She didn\u2019t have a green thumb,\" is negative and if she had a white thumb then it would be positive. Also, the sentence does not include the word white anywhere.\nOption C: red. It could be argued that red is associated with her plants dying, but the phrase, \"She had a black thumb,\" suggests the opposite, that she had a black thumb.\nOption D: yellow. Again this is plausible because the phrase, \"she even,\" suggests multiple, different occurrences of plant death. It also mentions a time in the past, which suggests that she did have some yellow thumbs at some point.\nOption E: green. Plausible because of the use of the phrase, \"green thumb\", however, the use of the negative \"She sure didn\u2019t,\" makes this an unlikely answer because a green thumb would be a positive thing.\nAnswer: Option A.\n\nInput: What do you use on the bun to finish cooking them?

This is an obvious and incorrect answer.\nOption d: rice. This would be eliminated on the same basis as option c.\nOption a: bread. The first part of the sentence indicates that someone already had the bread cooked, so the sentence could not have meant to indicate that this step had to happen.\nOption e: sauce.

The first step in answering a question about context is understanding the meaning of each term.\n2. As a gardener is known as having a green thumb, a person without a green thumb does not have this skill.\n3. To answer the question, we need to apply the general meaning of the term \"green thumb\" to the given paragraph to determine what it is that the person in the scenario lacked.\n4. Choice B: tools is incorrect as it is not a skill needed to grow and maintain a garden.\n5. Choice D: died is also incorrect as it is not directly related to gardening.\n6. Choices C: garden got poisoned and E: bad soil are the best answers. Choice C: garden got poison, refers to the idea of using chemicals or pesticides to improve the health of the soil, which is relevant to gardening.\n7. Choice D: bad soil implies that the soil has insufficient nutrients or is unhealthy, making it unfit for growing plants.\n8.

{"text": "was trying to grow something, she would just water it too much and kill the plant. Choices:  A (green thumb is someone with talent for growing plants). B (watering the plant too much results in it drying up and dying).\nRationales: A) watering the plant too much is not the cause of the plant dying. In fact, watering is very important for growing plants, especially in arid climates. If a plant is watered too much in a desert, it would likely die of drought. This fact points to her having no green thumb because she doesn't understand the process needed for growing a healthy plant, which is watering it correctly.\n\nRationales continued: B) watering the plant causes it to grow. Growing a plant involves several processes such as fertilizing soil, providing plants with sunlight, and watering enough to keep them hydrated. Overwatering, as in choice B, would likely prevent the plant from growing. If a plant isn't watered properly, it may dry up and die from drought as it is unable to grow. Therefore, this fact points to her not being skilled in gardening, which in the context of the sentence is shown to mean having a green thumb. \n\nRationales: C) green thumb is someone with talent or interest in growing plants, not someone who has bad luck when growing plants. \n\nRationale continued: If she had a green thumb, the death of the plants would be down to her ignorance of the proper process for growing a healthy green thumb. However, she doesn't have a green enough thumb to grow anything healthy, suggesting no true mastery of growing.\nChoice: D & E) none. It is unclear what these choices mean in relation to the situation.\n\nHaving looked at all the factors we will be able to conclude as outlined below:\n\nRationale: A) green thumb is someone who is skilled in growing healthy plants.

The first step to finding a correct answer is to identify the purpose of the question. In this case, the purpose of the question is to determine the correct phrase after \"kill it.\" \n2. Now we need to consider each option: killing pants, killing pants, killing patients, multiplying flowers, and molding flowers.\n3. Option A, killing pants, makes no sense. This doesn't fit in any way with the \"paint\" metaphor in this set of phrases.\n4. Option C, multiplying flowers, is a possible answer. Flowers that multiply could be considered pretty, though this might not be the intended purpose of the phrase \"beautiful flower.\"\n5. Option D, molding flowers, could be related to the metaphoric meaning of \"paint.\" Flower petals could be dried and the resulting material compressed into paint.\n6. Option E, madness, could be associated with the metaphoric \"paint,\" as the \"madness\" of an artist might be described as them \"painting\" and the confusion of their mind. However, this doesn't fit with the literal definition of \"kill it.\"  \n7. Now, option B could be an answer. This does make sense in the context of the question - it could be describing the madness of an artist while they paint. \n8.

First, let's eliminate choices that simply offer an unrelated response. Choices that can't be expected are:  E:  got sick  and C: it grew \n3. Next, we can eliminate options that don't have a negative connotation, such as D: it thrives and choice 4: it happened. \n4.

Choices:  A towel or wash rag B: water B2: light C: soil D E: the wrong plant type C2: more water\nRationales: Start by understanding the context. \"She sure didn't have\u2026\" clearly indicates it was not her intention.\n1. The options are ineffective/no help, dead, and green thumb. We should cross out no help as it doesn't help us select the best answer.\n2. Dead is also not helpful, but it doesn't mean she didn't have a \"green thumb\" either.\n3. We're now looking for an option that best describes why she didn't have green thumb.\n4. The sentence suggests she was watering the plants, but they were actually dead. This could mean she either watered them too much or not enough. \"Plants\" could refer to both flowers and vegetables/fruits.\n5. \"Watering them too much\" makes the most sense as it's less common to overwater a plant. \ud83c\udf31\n6. Option A towel or washhag is incorrect as it doesn't make sense in this scenario.\n7. Option B: water doesn't make sense unless she's trying to water a plant without actually getting close enough to it.\n8. Option C: soil doesn't make sense either unless she's trying grow plants in the wrong soil. Also, we're trying to discern if it was her intention to have a green thumb, and \"soil\" doesn't really indicate that.\n9. Option D: the wrong plant type makes perfect sense in this context.

Choices: 1: A: Have a plant 2: B: Take classes 3: C: Move out 4: D: Move in 5: E: Get up early\nRationales: When you see a question asking what someone can do, it's important to first analyze the circumstances for which this is being asked. \nIn this case, we are given a specific situation that suggests a negative outcome associated with a previous attempt to do something. The question asks us what someone can do in the given scenario to achieve a desired outcome. \nThe question doesn't offer a suggested list of actions but instead presents these actions as a choice. We then move on to analyze the choices. \nChoice 1: Let's rule out A: \"A plant\" because while it's an action (e.g. purchase plants, learn how to keep plants alive by reading a book, take classes), it's not what one can do to achieve the desired outcome. \nChoice 2: Taking classes (choice B) would provide the knowledge and skillset necessary to care for and nurture plants. This is a possible action and could achieve the desired outcome; however, we can eliminate choice B because it's not what someone can do, but what they must do first. \nChoice 3: The wording of this choice suggests a drastic measure. \"C: move out\" would imply a relocation or abandoning a place because it's not suitable for them. This is unlikely to resolve the issue since it's not necessary to move, and it may only cause more problems. Additionally, the choice has no clear indication of improving the green thumb, making it irrelevant for the question. If choosing \"move in\" (choice D) is likely to cause the same issues as \"move out\" (choice C), we can eliminate choice D since it is irrelevant to achieving a better outcome. \nChoice E: Waking up early (choice E) is not relevant to green thumbs but rather relates to the time available for gardening. \nTherefore, choice B: taking classes remains as the only answer choice (C: move out) with a logical answer, and that is what we mark as the best response. \nAnswer: C: Move out (this eliminated)\n\nInput: Who", "answer": " 59"}

We then determine the possible answers; \"I don't know\" (choice A) is a logical answer if we're uncertain about what the meaning is behind the statement. \"believe you\" (choice B) and \"I don't believe you\" (choice C) are unnecessary answers that serve to draw attention away from the focus of the statement, which is the death of the plants. \n2. \"Yes,\" I'm sure\" (choice E) does not answer the question, but merely states the narrator's confidence in her ability to grow plants. \n3. The phrase \"grow a green thumb\" is generally used to refer to someone who is good at growing plants and having a green thumb. \n4.

Option A: plants died: This would be consistent with having a green thumb or green finger, as plants dying are a common, negative result expected when working with plant care. However, it's also not necessarily unique to this situation, as other factors could have caused the plants to die.\n2.2. Option D: animals died: This answer choice is also consistent with the person not having a green thumb or finger, as animals dying is a common, negative expected result when working with pet care.\n2.3. Option B: house had stains: This answer choice is associated more with cooking, cleaning, or home maintenance, and not gardening. \n2.4. Option F: house had bugs: This answer choice is not directly related to having a green thumb, as bugs living in a residence are not unique to plant care. \n3.

Choices:  A. bury B. chop C. hang D. throw away E. trash F. destroy.\nRationales: First, the question asks \"She sure didn't have...\" This implies that her gardener husband didn't have a great plant-care record and that the narrator (in this case, probably her husband) didn't have a fond memory of her. \nSecond, let's consider the options: Option A: Burying is a common way to dispose of something. However, \"buried in the past\" or \"buried in mistakes\" doesn't fit, so this one's out. \nOption B: Chop is not a common way of disposing of something. It doesn't fit the context or the metaphor (disposing of a good memory) so it's not the correct answer. \nOption C: Hanging is a common way of disposal. However, \"been hanging in time' means this woman's husband hasn't paid much attention to her over the last few years, so option C: hanging isn't necessarily the correct choice. \nOption D: Toss is the most likely way of disposal of things. It does seem that the narrator wants to throw away the memory or the mistake, so D: toss could be the correct choice. However, the fact that she wasn't able to make a great plant-care garden might make her husband think twice about tossing her away. \nOption E: Throw away is another common way of disposal and doesn't really seem to fit into this context at all, so the answer is probably C: toss.

The question presents a situation where someone (She) attempts to plant a flower, but ends up digging a hole. In such a situation, it would be normal to wonder why she ended up with a hole instead of a flower. \nTherefore, a correct answer would be an explanation for this. \nAnswer choices: Answer choice A (A garden) is not an explanation for why someone ends up with a hole rather than a flower. Rather, it provides an example of someone who successfully plants a flower, while answer choice B (A tree stump) is a description of someone who planted a tree and still ended up with a hole.

While in some cases a tablet might be referred to as a PC, option B is unlikely to be a correct answer. \nChoice C: Notebook.

Before, we focused on how to select the best answer. But here, we have two types of questions: an actual question and several answer choices. \nThe first step is to understand how the question is asking: did she have the green thumb? Or did she not have it? \nThen, interpret the answer choices. \n\nAnswer: A.\n\nInput: How can you tell how hard you pushed in an exam? Choices: 1. You push hard every exam you take 2.

{"text": "had the right tool for the job how did her work turn out? Choices: 1. A: terrible 2. B: messy 3. C: successful D: disastrous 4. E: perfect\nRationales: First, note what the term \"tool for the job\" implies - it refers to a solution or a solution which works well. \n1. Now try to connect the two concepts. If someone doesn't have a green/successful thumb, this suggests that they do not possess special abilities. \n2. Considering the answer choices: A: terrible - this could apply to someone having skill or a bad job. It fits with the initial description of not having a green thumb.\n3. However, the phrase also suggests that they \"had the right tool for the\" job. So, it follows that they actually meant to have a successful or good thumb; yet they were still not successful and ended up with a terrible thumb.\n4. Therefore, option B: messy fits the description of having the right tool.\n5. C: successful fits the description of actually succeeding in their \"job\" or trying to have a successful thumb.\n6. D: disastrous. It doesn't quite go with having the right tool and succeeding.\n7. E: perfect. This would not fit with the other pieces of information provided.\n8. Therefore the best answer is B : messy. It fits the best with the description of someone trying to have a good thumb while not being successful ultimately.\n\nAnswer: B : messy\n\nInput: Where could you find a tree with big round berries? Choices:  (A) A: fruit orchards (B) B: forests (C) C: meadows (D) D: farms (E) E: deserts\nRationales: Tree with big round berries could be a fruit tree that bears round, plump, berries. If we eliminate choices that do not make sense, we can think of the answer. From the context of the question, the place with a tree having berries sounds like a fruit orchard to me, in this case.\n\nAnswer: A: fruit orchards\n\nInput: Who found the tree that grew a whole forest of fruit?

{"text": "could water her own plants, the plants would die Choices:  A. She should give plants to her friends B. She should water the plants more C. She could take care of plants like a pro\n\nRationales: First, consider the possible answer to the question. It can depend on what the writer intended to convey, but the literal meaning of a \"green thumb\" is someone with a knack for gardening or caring for plants. So, the author is not describing the person as having a green thumb because she can't keep her own plants alive. \nNow, let's tackle the choice A: she should give plants to her friend. The sentence already indicated that giving plants to friends wasn't working, so we can eliminate any of the answers that might lead to this. \nAnother option is choice B: she should water the plant more. Yes, a person with a green thumb might water their plants more frequently, but again, this is not the issue with the woman in the story. \nAnd finally, choice C: she could take care of plants as a pro. While it's possible that having a green thumb means being able to grow and care for plants with success, it doesn't seem to be the author's intention. The woman's inability to take care of her own plants and keep them alive is not related to having a green thumb. \nTherefore, the correct answer is C: She could take care of plans like a pro.\nAnswer: C-She could take care of plants lik a pro\n\nInput: Which type of math has numbers with 2 digits or less?

Option 2: Abacus is a counting tool that involves the use of multiple beads and is based on additions rather than using smaller numbers. Option 3: Calculator can be used with multiple digits, making it unsuitable for our purpose. Option 4: Addition is used to add multiple numbers together, so it isn't a suitable choice. Option 5: Multiples involve multiplying multiple numbers (e.g. 2x3x4), not", "answer": " 97"}
{"text": "has done a good deed, the person could only think of the opposite. What did the person do? Choices: 1. Cut the thumb off 2. Burn the thumb 3. Cut the fingernails 4. Stick the thumb to something 5. Grow a new thumb\nRationales: First, to understand the question, we need to clarify the expression \"green thumb.\" \"Green thumb\" is an idiom meaning the ability to be a talented gardener or to have a natural affinity for gardening. It does not literally mean possessing a green thumb, but rather the phrase is figurative, and it has nothing to do with a person's actual thumb. It is used to indicate the person's capabilities in their work or the activities they enjoy.\nNext, we consider the answer choices.\nThe first option \"cut the thumb off\" is not a possible scenario. \nThe second option \"burn the thumb\" makes literal sense, but the meaning is unclear and needs more context.  \nThe third option \"cut the fingernails\" might be a possible choice, as fingers and thumbs are both considered \"hands.\" We don't know the size or nature of the thumb in this example. It could be large enough to be considered a \"hand\" by itself, therefore, this answer choice is not viable.\nThe fourth option \"stick the thumb to something\" might be a possible solution, but not a common action one would do.\nThe fifth option \"grow a new thumb\" also makes sense and is a viable alternative. \nTherefore, the correct answer choice is 5: Grow a new thumb.\nAnswer: 5: Grow A new thumb\n\n**Question 8:  Which of the following is the best description for the term 'candescents?'

{"text": "was doing good by planting a seeds, they never growed. Choices:  A. bad luck B. it died C. they didn't take care of it D. she doesn't know good soil from bad soil E. she doesn't practice fertilizing\nRationales: First, understand the question and the choices we need to consider. We need to ask ourselves why someone doesn't have a green plant when she's trying to plant seeds.\n1. We consider option A: bad luck. This doesn't seem likely as bad luck isn't explicitly stated, and it's not the common reason for plant seeds not to grow. \n2. Option B: it died. This is a potential reason for plant seeds to not grow, but we need to think about the context of whether something could or couldn't \"grow\" out of seeds planting, and why they failed.\n3. Option C: they didn't take good care of them. This is an accurate reason for plant seeds that have been planted to not grow. \n4. Option D: she doesn't know the difference between good and bad soil. This is a potential answer, but the statement \"every time\" implies that her lack of knowledge about good soil is not consistent with her efforts to plant seeds. \n5. Option E: she doesn't practice good soil fertilization. This is a common way to help plants grow, and a lack of fertilization can contribute to seeds not growing.\n6. Therefore, option D: she doesn' have good knowledge or practice about planting good soil is the best option. \nAnswer: D: she doesn' t practice good soil fertilizing", "answer": " 4000"}

This implies that the subject possesses good skill and/or knowledge about plants or gardening. \nConsider the answer choices: Green A: water, This means that we assume that if a person were to have a green thumb, they should know about watering plants. This isn\u2019t necessarily true and is not consistent with the idea of having a green thumb. \nGreen B: check, A check can be an excellent indicator that someone is an experienced gardener or posses green thumb but does not represent the actual color green. \nGreen C: grow This means that we assume if a person had a green thumb, that they should have the knowledge on how to grow plants. \nGreen D: weed This means that we assume someone with a green thumb will automatically have the knowledge or skills on how to weed, again not necessarily true. \nGreen E: harvest This implies that someone who has a green thumb will harvest, so the choices that don't include the word \"harvest,\" like Green A, B, and C, are out. \nGreen Answer: E: harvest Green means every time she thought she needs to what, this implies that the subject doesn\u2019t automatically know how to harvest.

Answer: the man will stop eating for a long time, so he will not have access to meals.\nNow, we know the meal options, what would probably be the last meal the man would eat? Salad, the first option, does not make sense as a last meal as it isn't a large meal and is not usually viewed as a significant part of the meal. \nNow, the choices that include breakfast, lunch, and dinner can be eliminated, as they're all very typical meals.\nThe only left that makes sense is the option", "answer": " 25"}

The answer should reflect a situation where \"she\" is trying to grow plants or take care of a garden, but it's actually too difficult for her, and she ends up having a lot of problems instead.\n2. Starting with answer choice A: Every time \"she\" thinks she's a gardener there's a list of problems. There are probably too many problems for anyone to deal with, let alone \"a gardener,\" which doesn't fit the narrative.\n3. Next, we look at choice B: Someone had a green thumb. This describes someone actually having a green thumb, which is very much a gardener.\n4. Going on to choice C, Every plant died. This could be a result of \"she\" trying to take care of plants, but it seems very specific and unlikely.\n5. Now, we're checking choice D, Plants grew much too high. This could be a problem if \"she\" was trying to take care of a garden but doesn't seem likely.\n6. Lastly, choice E: There was a terrible storm. This might be a cause of the problems in the garden, but it doesn't necessarily reflect \"she\" thinking she's a gardner going into this situation.

Choices: a: zoo b: lake c: woods d: river e: beach. \nRationales:: First we look at the question and try to understand the context. \n\"Summer vacation\" refers to a period of time when students typically do not attend school, and it is often during this time that they go on holiday or vacation. Since the question refers to the monkey, we know that the monkey either attends school or is a student. Based on this information, we can assume that the monkey is too young to use a car to travel, so options A, C, and D can be eliminated.\n\nAnswer: A: Zoo\n\nInput: The kid with the best hand in the world is from where location? Choices: a. America b. China c. Great Britain d. Russia e. Japan\nRationales:: A person's \"hand\" refers to their ability in a particular sport.

Choices: a) in a city b) in the country c) in the mountain d) at the seashore e) at the airport. Rationales:: In the context of the question, the person must be living in either a city or a country. However, the country must not be in the mountains since \"country\" (as the meaning of the \"countryside\") is not the mountain itself but the area outside the city. \nThus, \"at the sea shore\" and \"at the airport\" do not fit the question since they are not within a country, but outside a country.\n\nAnswer: C: in the mountain\n\nInput: The girl found the thing, the thing is?

Choices:  A. die B. kill C. fail D. lose E. fail\nRationales: Firstly, we need to interpret the question - she sure didn't have \"x\" - die, kill, fail, lose, etc. - a green thumb. \n1. She could have a green thumb, but every time she thought she would save the plant, it died. Therefore, she isn't a good gardener and lacks the skills necessary to care for plants, making this an invalid choice.\n2. She was so bad with plants that she killed them every time they were near her. This would make her a better murderer than gardener.\n3.

Choices:  ____.Choices: A. shirt B. sandals C. blanket D. towel E. shoes F. dress ____.\nRationales: There are six parts to this question. \n1. Start by reading what the sentence is asking - what did the girl put on?.\n2. Once we know which parts to focus on. \n3. We can then read each choice and evaluate each. \n4. We can ask questions about the meaning of each one. For example, if she's wearing pants, would she also wear a shirt? Is it likely for her to wear just one shoe and not the other? Does it make sense for her to put on a sandal just to remove it and put on a shoe instead? \n5. After asking ourselves these questions, we can eliminate choices that don't make sense for each part.\n6. For example, choice A - \"shirt\", makes no sense. It's not reasonable to wear a shirt and no pants. \n7. Therefore, we can eliminate \"shirt\" as a choice for part 1. \n8. Choice B - \"sandals\" also makes no sense. \n9. Choice D - \"towel\", has similar questions. Can you wear a blanket under a shirt? Could you wear towel only without wearing pants too? \n10. Choice F - \"d", "answer": " 2350"}

{"text": "was growing roses, she got weeds. What color would you say she had?

From this information, we can determine which of the answer options best suits their traits, based on their success or failure.\n2. Starting with option A: green thumb, we begin eliminating options by considering what traits we can associate with the phrase.\n3. We cannot say option B: pink, as it represents the color of the roses rather than a person. \n4. We cannot say option C: yellow, as it represents the yellow color, not the person. \n5. We cannot say option D: purple, as it represents the purple color, not the person either. \n6. When we eliminate the four options, we see that only option E: blue can best describe the character. The character's intention to grow roses (despite being faced with failure) matches the trait we associate with the color blue, which is to persevere through the challenges and keep trying. Therefore, the best possible answer is option E: blue.\nAnswer: E = blue\n\nInput: He got tired of all of that reading and research, so he finally decided to go over what he already learned.

{"text": "'d planted a ______, it seemed to ______ off. Choices:  A) flower B) turn to plant C) dry up D) get weed E) grow\nRationales: Understand the question: \"plant\" in this context refers to a growing thing and \"dry\", in these sentences, means they disappear or go away. \nNow, read the answer choices: \"She sure didn't have\", means this person was not very good at something. \"Green thumb\", means to have success at gardening tasks. The sentence \"Every time she planted _____ it seemed to ________ off\" suggests she was trying to plant something but it kept shrinking after she planted it. So, A: flower is the wrong answer. \nThe next best answer, C: dry up is not grammatically correct, so let's eliminate this option. \nThe answer is D: get weed. In this context, \"weed\" means shrinking or disappearing after planting, which is exactly what the person described.\nAnswer: D Get weed\n\nInput: Where was the man standing when he took a selfie?

To take a selfie, we need to be standing or standing up, which is the most fitting answer. Choice E: standing by oneself doesn't seem likely as a place for taking a selfie.  \nOut of choice B, C, and D: self-doubts and self-doubt are not locations. 3rd person selfie is not a correct way to say it and there is no such thing. \nThe next choice, B: in self-care, refers to the state of being.

We start by looking at each choice.\na. A: She is a gardener. This does not make sense as the sentence is stating she does not have a green thumb, i.e. she does not make successful plants or gardens. A gardener is someone who grows plants and makes gardens. This is the opposite of what the sentence tells us. This can be eliminated.\nb. B: She had the worst luck. This does not make any sense either as the sentence is implying she makes things brown, not herself brown. This can be removed.\n\nc. C: She would grow plants. This can be eliminate as well as she has brown plants, not growth brown plants.\n\nd. D: Her soil had nutrient deficiency issues. This can be eliminarted as the sentence states \"every time she thought\". This implies that her soil is not constantly deficient, only when she plants that it turns brown. This is incompatible with nutrient deficient soil that she has all the time.\n\ne. E. She will always plant seeds into the ground. The sentence is stating \"every time\". Only when she plant seeds does it turn into a brown color instead of yellow. It makes sense \"she would grow plants\" would turn brown when she grows them.

{"text": "had planted what was it she actually planted? Choices: 1. A: flowers. 2. B: tomorrow. 3. C: fruits. 4. D: leaves. 5. E: vegetables. \nRationales: This is a task that asks us how to interpret the choices as answers to the question. We have five different options: flowers (choice A), tomorrow (choice B), fruits (choice C), leaves (choice D), and vegetables (choice E). Let's consider each option: \n1. Flowers: This has a positive connotation and would be expected as a result of someone with a green thumb. If someone \"failed\" at gardening, flowers are one of the outcomes they could hope to achieve. However, we must consider if it's a common enough outcome to be considered a fail, because, in this case, we're looking at how often the gardener tried to replicate the outcome, not the outcome itself. \n2. Tomorrow: We can eliminate this as a plausible answer because it is not likely someone would grow or planting flowers or vegetables in their garden if they've been unsuccessful many times. It's better to be cautious than to rush into a hasty decision. A similar answer, that of \"fruits\" (answer C). However, the question does not specifically state that the choice should indicate a result of unsuccessful attempt, it implies that the choice should indicate an unsuccessful attempt by someone with a green thumb because it's not typically associated with failure. Therefore, we can eliminate both options.\n3. Fruits: This option is also not plausible because a gardener could be successful at growing and producing fruits, even if they don't have a green thumbnail.\n4. Leaves: This is also not likely, as a gardener with a green thumbnail could easily identify leaves that are not of their intended plant. Also, if a plant is struggling or dying, it's unlikely a person would think it was successful growth.\n5. Vegetables: This is the correct answer, as it fits the context and intent of the question. Vegetables are often seen as the result of an unsuccessful attempt at gardening because they tend to grow more readily and are easier to maintain than other plants.

Choices:  A. did not water it enough B. it wasn't her plant C. she didn't take good care of it D. she watered it wrong E. it was probably fake\nRationales: First, the task description presents an example and then asks what the implied conclusion is. The answer choice options are all possible inferences.\n1. Green thumb is metaphorically used to describe someone or someone's ability to grow and thrive at growing plants; the idea that they are green in the color sense is irrelevant.\n2. We first consider watering it wrong.\n3. There was insufficient watering to keep the plant alive, which was the point (in the story) which makes it an incorrect inference, since the plant was dead.\n4. Next the issue of not taking care of the plant; this seems to make sense on the surface, but because the plant was already dead, that is not the explanation for it being dead.\n5. Moves onto watering it wrong. This is more likely, and we understand that the person didn't know how much to water, but there was lack of effort on their behalf to care for the plant. This leaves us with this option as the best fit.\nAnswer: B. did not water the plant.\n\nInput: In what way that the computer can't understand? Choices:  What way is that?  Choices:  A) it doesn't want to hear anything about how it makes a person feel B) it can't do that C) it only wants to know how happy the person is\nRationales: The task requires you to provide the correct choice among four answer options (the phrasing in the question is \"in what way that the computer cannot do x\"). \n1. Choice A: \"it doesn't want to know about how it makes the person feel\". Although computers tend to have emotions associated with them (\"feeling\", \"upset\", \"anxious\", etc), this answer choice simply does not contain the exact phrasing needed to match the task.\n2.

This is a correct response as it makes a logical sense given the question asked.\n  * Answer C. They had a bad time. This is another correct response as it makes an accurate response from the question asked.\nWe are given the choices E. she had a bad time watering the soil and she didn't know how she should plant her new garden.

Overlooking (Option D) is incorrect because \"missing\" does not require the use of \"overlook\" since it's defined as \"not seeing something or someone that is near to you.\"\n4.

Shovels are used to push earth, not to run vehicles.  \n3. Options D are not used to run vehicles. There's no connection between an oil can, a dustpan, or a leaf blower and running a vehicle.  \n4. Choice E, Leaf blower, is not an option that someone may leave to run their vehicles. A leaf blower is used to push leaves and debris, not a vehicle.

The phrase \"She sure didn't have green thumb\" refers to someone who has a difficult time maintaining their plants. \n2. We move to the next step to find the missing word. \n3. Each option should be considered to determine the best fit.\n4. A: flowers. This option doesn't seem to make sense, as someone who does have a green thumb would have the ability to grow flowers. \n5. B: animals. This might be correct in certain circumstances, but in general, someone who is bad at growing plants would not focus on having animals as their only means of maintaining a greenhouse. \n6. C: watering. This makes sense as watering plants is a necessary skill to keep them alive. \n7. D: sun. Sunlight is essential for plants to grow and thrive. \n8. E: leaves. Leaves are a vital part of a plant's structure, and someone who couldn't maintain them would have a hard time keeping the plants healthy. \n9.

Starting with A: fishing. Fishing is not the main purpose of using a kayak, making it an unsuitable answer.\n2. Now looking at B: paddling, we see that it is a common activity associated with kayaking, so this is a likely choice. \n3.

The woman is repeatedly attempting to grow trees, yet every time, the one aspect that is expected to be pleasant or pleasing turns out to be undesirable.\n2. Every time a tree she tries to cultivate turns out to be brown.\n3. She can't use the term \"trees\" properly, since the word is only referring to the one aspect of the tree that is undesirable.\n4. So, based on the description, the answer must be \"undesirable\" or \"bad\" in some way.\n5. Only options A: orange, B: yellow, and E: brown, are relevant here.\n6. The woman may attempt to grow an orange or yellow tree, but all the trees turn out to be brown. So, none of these options can be used to describe her failure.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: diseased.

We should consider which answer fits the context of the question and makes the most sense. \n3. In this case, the most sensible answer choice is A: nothing grows, as a green thumb typically refers to a person's ability to grow healthy plants. \n4. Also, we eliminate the other choices; a seed not sprouting can be caused by environmental factors or improper planting techniques. Leaves falling might imply that the plant is dying. Planting too high is not a green thumb issue. Soil overdose is possible but does not match the context.\n5.

The best way to do this is to begin with the most implausible choice first.  \nStep 03: The next step is to begin a table to summarize the answers:\nIn this example, the answers with the highest probability of being successful plants are those that are not related to her husband. Therefore, we have two choices: Pumpkin and Carrot. Pumpkin would definitely make a good choice as it is known to be hardy enough to survive the worst conditions, making them good candidates to represent a good green thumb. On the other hand, carrot is hardy but requires proper lighting for it to be a good plant. Carrot is also known to be prone to diseases, making it difficult to plant if not cured quickly. While one can argue that even pumpkin isn't the best option then, it is still a good choice to represent a green thumb. \nStep  07: Based on what we now know, it was probably pumpkin that would be her green thumb (the answer).\nStep 08: We must double check to make sure that the answer selected is still the most likely, given additional information: \nStep 09: In this example, the only source of additional information from this sentence is \"Pumpkins grow big and fast.

A train station is the place where a person goes to wait for a train. Fabric (used to make curtains or upholstery) could potentially be ordered at a train station, but it's unlikely. So, we have not eliminated all incorrect choices: train station can be eliminated.\n\nStep 3: Consider the remaining option: tailor shop (Choice R). The sentence says that a person is typically thinking about where they are if they are \"waiting for a train.\" Waiting for a train is commonly associated with a time spent at a station, hence the question of that place.

She sure she was on mute that whole time. E. She felt so bad that she didn't notice she watered the plant too much.\nRationales:1. First, it helps to recognize the key phrase in the question: \"every time she thought she was (doing something) the flower died.\" This suggests that something is going wrong despite the owner's best intentions. 2. \"She put a lot into that\" implies that the owner is putting a lot of effort into caring for the plant, implying that what she is doing is wrong and shouldn't be considered her fault. 3. Moving on to the answer choices, it's a matter of considering the implied meaning in each answer choice. We need to think of how the owner is \"watering well\" in the context presented, despite the flower's frequent deaths. 4. Answer Choice A: She was putting the wrong \"water\" (as in \"wrong\" to kill the plant each time), is incorrect, as it contradicts the implied meaning in the rest of the passage, namely that the owner is putting \"a lot\" into watering the plant. 5. Answer choice B: \"She was holding it in water (as in \"holding\" the plant in water until it died),\" contradicts the implied message about effort being put into watering the flower and is thus incorrect. 6. Answer Choice C (The sun came in her window, every day, she thought she was providing (the light/sun).\" This answer choice explains the owner's misconception about how she is watering the flower. The key part of this answer choice is \"every day, she thought she\" which implies that the owner keeps thinking she is providing the necessary light for the plant by opening the window each day. 7. Answer choice D (She sure she was on mutt the whole time, she didn't notice the watering part): this answer choice is incorrect, as the owner believes the sun is coming through the window and providing light for the plant", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "was doing fine she took a flower and did what? Choices: 1: Fell over 2: Died 3: Started rotting 4: Ate it 5: Grew \nRationales: The task requires understanding the words \"thought she was doing fine.\" This indicates a mistake or miscalculation on the person's part, indicating that whatever she's doing is not producing the desired result. \nShe is, therefore, not successfully caring for her plants. The question asks us what she did to the flowers every time she \"thought she was fine.\" \n4 options are provided, each one representing the possible outcomes of her actions with the flower. \n1 option is missing from the list. One more thing to keep in mind is that the person is not doing her job successfully. In other words, her performance is far from ideal. \nIn this question, \"green thumb\" refers to someone's ability to care for plants effectively. The answer must be what this person does every time she believes she is doing fine but actually is not. \nEach of the options provided is connected to the flowers (what's happening to the flowers) or the process (what the person is doing) rather than a person's performance (the ability to do better). \nOption 4 (ate it) is not connected to the person's performance at all. The only option that directly connects with the performance is option 1, which fits the context given. \nEven though the person is not doing their job well, they are not entirely incompetent. Therefore, option 1 (fell over) as opposed to option 4 (ate) is the correct one. \nOption 3 (start to rot) can be eliminated because rot occurs from inside the plant. Option 5 (grow) can also be eliminated as it is not the person's performance that is being discussed. \nOption 2, dying, also cannot be the correct answer because the question is not asking if she performs poorly every time she thinks she's doing fine, but rather what she does when she is wrong and thinks she's doing well. \nThis indicates that she might accidentally hurt or even destroy the plant on some occasions without realizing it.

This implies the opposite, someone with a green thumb would surely have plants that are either thriving or healthy, indicating she isn't lacking a green thumb.\n3. Correctly watering. The statement that she was watering her plans well shows that she was trying to do what's best. If she was attempting to water her plants correctly but was always failing, this would make more sense.\n4. Correctly fertizing. Fertilizing correctly would be part of trying to water correctly, so we can eliminate it as an answer.\n5. Correctly weed clearing.

{"text": "could grow a plant and it wasn't what we call flowers, every year it died. Choices: A: Rose B: Ivy C: Violet D: Sun Flower\nRationales: The key to this question is understanding the meaning of \"green thumb\". If we take it literally, it refers to having a good natural ability at gardening or the cultivation of plants. This skill is often attributed to having green or healthy growing thumbs, which explains the expression \"green thumb\". (https://www.thefreedictionary.com/green+thumb)\n\nIn this sentence, \"she\" and \"we\" are using the term \"green thumb\" in a figurative way - it's not about having a green color, but rather having skill or aptitude in gardening. As we can see in the sentence, this phrase is often interchanged with \"gardening skills\" or \"expert\", so in context, the answer to this question could be any of the following options: \n\n- A: Rose - a term used to refer to a plant that produces flowers of various colors or types, ranging from pink, yellow, white, or red\n- B: Ivy - a term used to describe a group of plants with a climbing growth habit\n- C: Violet - a term used to identify a type of plant that commonly grows in the wild\n- D: Sun Flower - a term used to specifically refer to a type of plant that produces bright yellow or yellow-orange flowers that bloom at night, and that get their name from its sunny looks (https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sunflower)\n- F: Flowers, as mentioned in the options\n\nSo, the best answer would be F: Flower\n  \nAnswer: F: Flowers\n\nInput: What type of animal is a cow?

{"text": "had watered a plant she was actually killing it. What did she have? Choices : A: pumpkin B: chocolate C: flowers D: grass E: carrot\nRationales: This one's trickier due to the unusual meaning of \"green thumb\"; more explicitly, this phrase is used to denote having a knack for growing plants or flowers, but not having the standard meaning of \"green thumb\" that many people might assume. In this example, the writer wanted to emphasize that this person didn't have a skill or an aptitude for growing plants. \nRather than simply using a \"normal\" phrase like \"plant killer,\" the writer instead gave a more cryptic phrase. Thus, the first step is to work out what the meaning of the \"green thumb\" in the example is, and consider each option's connection to that meaning. \nStep 1: We need to interpret \"didn't have a green...\", meaning she was not skilled in growing plants. We can eliminate choice A: pumpkins. A pumpkin is neither a plant nor a flower and is not mentioned any further in the sentence. Likewise, it's unlikely choice D: grass can be the answer, since a person does not generally kill a plant to grow grass. This leaves us with choice C: Flowers or choice E: carrot. \nStep 2a: Now we need to work out what a proper \"green thumb\" should consist of - to grow plants/flowers. \nChoice C: Flowers is correct in that flowers are often grown as ornaments or decorative pieces, and require some level of care and watering, so this can be identified as a candidate answer.\nStep 2b: Carrot isn't a plant or flower, so it can't be a possible answer.\nStep 3: Considering choice E: Carrot: This does not answer our question. There's nothing implied in the text or phrase to indicate that the person can grow carrots. Moreover, the lack of an active verb in this choice (there's no explicit action to denote watering) also makes this an incorrect answer.\nStep 4: Choice C: flowers is the correct answer here, as it is a plant/flower and has an active verb associated with it (the phrase \"thought she had watered\").\nAnswer: C: flowers", "answer": " 2"}

Option A: gave us all a laugh. This is clearly out because the person did not die.\n2. Option B: thought she could water it. Again, this makes no sense because she is the one to make a joke.\n3. Option C: made us laugh. If it was already funny, then they must already have watered it. The context could be that she made us laugh at them self-mistaking which has happened many times.\n4. Option D: always out of water. Making her out of water does not allow the plant to flourish.\n5. Option E: Always out of plant.

{"text": "had a great plant, she would give up before blooming. Choices:  A) give up on planting new ones B) kill the plant in order to replanting C) try new ones D) watering too much and too little E) just like a good manager\nRationales: The question asks about an inept gardener who consistently fails to care for her plants adequately. In order to choose the correct answer, it's important to assess the behavior and actions described in the question phrase.\n\nChoice A - When the phrase states \"every time she thought she had 'a' great plant,\" it implies that the gardener is attempting to cultivate good plants. However, her actions of \"giving up before blooming\" suggest that she lacks the ability or skill to properly take care of her plants. Therefore, choice A: \"give up on planting new \" plants is not a likely option, as she would already be giving up on her plants.\n\nChoice B - If she were killing the plant in order to \"replanting,\" or reseed her garden with new plants, then her actions would be consistent with a person who has a \"green thumb\" and is successful in gardening. However, it can be inferred that she is doing the other opposite of this, which is why she is \"giving up before blossoming.\" Therefore, option B is not likely to be the correct answer.\n\nChoice C - In an attempt to care for her plants, the gardener in this case may try different tactics. She may try new things, which is why she would be \"trying new ones.\" However, there is still no evidence that she has the skills or ability to properly foster and grow plants that are healthy and stunning. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer but rather is used as a sub-point.\n\nChoice D - The gardener may have varying watering habits which could lead to over-watering or under-watering. Choice D, \"watering too much and too less,\" doesn't represent the gardener in the question correctly, and also is not the focus of the question. Choice D does not provide any insight into why the gardener's plants do not flourish. The phrase \"watering too much\" would imply that the gardener is providing too much water for the plants, leading to their eventual demise.", "answer": " 126"}
{"text": "was watering it, it would wither Choices:  A plant B topsoil C ground D soil\nRationales: First, one should make an interpretation of the sentence. The sentence is talking about a plant. It could be interpreted as a plant or greenery that died, but because of the mention of \"it\", it's most likely referring to a plant, not greenery.\n\nContinuing the analysis, the phrase \"withering\" also indicates that it's not a literal \"death\" that occurred here. It's likely the person was trying to use water but instead killed the plant.  \nNow, considering each option.\n\nOption A: plant - Although plants can die, there needs to be an indication that it would wither or die, which this sentence doesn't provide. Also, the sentence could apply to multiple plants, so this option is not applicable.\n\nOption B: topsoil - This one may seem logical as well. However, topsoil is a layer on top of the actual ground. It could be a possible cause of withering and the death of a plant, but in order to ensure the accuracy of the answer, we should explore the option more.\n\nContinuation of option 2. What makes topsoil so useful for plants is the nutrients and microorganisms in it. However, there's no information about the type of plant or whether it required nutrients or not to survive.  \nThe only way to confirm it is true is by using more evidence and additional information that supports Option B and the theory that topsoil causes the plant to wither. Since this isn't the case, we should eliminate Option B.\n\nContinuance of Option 2: If we want to avoid Option B, Option C is also a possible answer. Although there's no indication of what type of plant it is, it could mean that it could be a type of vegetable or herb, which require sunlight to grow. This would fit the metaphor of it dying when she \"thought she was watering it\", meaning she gave it water but it wasn't enough for it to survive, and eventually died.\n\nContinuity of Option 3: Herb is generally a plant that is not grown for producing nutrients.

Remember, a green thumb is known as a talent for growing plants.\nWe start by eliminating some options: A: Grass refers to what is grown on lawns, but is not particularly significant in a garden, nor is it known for its longevity; therefore, we can rule it out.\nB: Flowers, C: Shrubs, and D: Bush. All of these are plants, but they don't necessarily have the specific characteristics being described in the example.\nThink of the plant being referred to as one that is hardy, easy to grow, and easy to maintain, and be able to see why the options listed above don't fit this description. These plants all need a certain level of care and attention, and may be more difficult to grow than a typical green thumb is capable of.\nE: Trees. This could be possible too, but we are looking at the case of planting in this example, and trees are bigger plants and not necessarily ones you would want to grow from scratch.\nThis leaves us with the option of looking at B: flower or C: shrub. Flowers refer to specific plants that come in seasonal variety, and typically require some level of care to make them last longer. Shrubs also need care and maintenance, but are usually hardier, smaller-sized plants, and may be more accessible for someone with a less green thumb.

This makes sense and is a popular option for people to use plants for, making it a good choice.\nB: dog snacks.

This could be a plausible option, as it's the end product of someone taking care of plants, and a failure might involve the plants dying.\n2. B: weed. A person's garden is the literal definition of a weed, so we consider if this option might fit. However, weed can also be used to refer to someone undesirable or unfavorable.

This answer can be a potential possibility if the person is not able to keep up with watering or fertilizing, which might lead to the plants burning and dying, but we're eliminating this option because we can't observe this in her own eyes.\n4. D: birds. Birds can be either beautiful or destructive, depending on the situation. So, while this answer could possibly fit, the other options have fewer disadvantages.\n5. E: rain.

{"text": "may bloom the flower never did. Choices:  A : a rose B: carrot C: potato D: tree E: sunflower\nRationales: The first step is to decipher the answer choices. Here, we have some plants given as options for answer choices, indicating that it could be any of those plants.\n1. A: A rose would not be in the sentence, since it did not bloom; also, she was using sunflowers, meaning that this was not a rose.\n2. C: Potato did not do well either and did not bloom, therefore, it is excluded.\n3. D: Tree did not do well either, so it is removed as well.\n4. E: Sunflower also did not do well, so it is removed out, leaving Sunflower as the only plant that could possibly work. Let us say it would be true.\n5. Lastly, we consider what each statement suggests that the plant should be doing to determine the best answer.\n6. A should be true, according to the question. If rose was in the plant, the sentence would read \"she surely didn't have a rose.\" However, this is not the case, suggesting that rose is not part of the plant.\n7. B and C are all plants that did not bloom, as evidenced by the use of \"fowler.\"\n8. D and E were all plants that did not do well, evidenced by the presence of the words \"didn't\", \"thought she\", and \"wouldn't.\"\n9. A: Sunflower has an inherent tendency to bloom and therefore is the best answer.\n10. Hence, B: Sunflower is the correct answer.

If she is not successful at growing a plant, she may think of herself as unskilled or inexperienced, similar to other people in this situation who may struggle with plant care. \n2. She may blame herself for not trying harder, thus she probably thinks she is responsible for her plant's failure. \n3. She may think of other people as being more skilled in gardening, which might make her feel disadvantaged or inferior. \n4. She might think about why other people are successful in growing their own plants, while she is not, which can lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment. \n5. In summary: She probably thinks of herself as inexperienced or unsuccessful. \nThe answer is therefore D: her partner.\nInput: If they put sugar in tea, what food can they be making? Choices:  a: pudding b: pie c: soup d: cake e: sandwich\nRationales: In this question, the key is to identify which of the options is the most likely to be associated with the phrase \"put sugar in tea.\" \nThe options can be grouped into two main categories:\nCakes and pies: These are both sweet treats that are often made with sugar.\nSoups: Soups are typically made with water, but they can also be made with other ingredients such as vegetables and meat. One type of soup that uses sugar to sweeten it is known as Russian Tea, where sugar is often added to enhance the flavor.\nTeas: In some regions, tea is often served with sugar as a sweetener. This could be a potential association between sugar and tea.\nIf we combine all these considerations, the most likely answer is e: sandwich.\nThe answer is therefore e: sandwich", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "was on to something, she always found it out in what season? Choices: 1. A: spring 2. B: fall 3. C: summer 4.

The first step, understanding the question, is to determine what the sentence means. After reading and re-reading the sentence, we conclude that the correct answer is the \"she\" didn't have a sufficient level of skill to succeed in plant care. \n2. Next, a determination about the options. There are 4 possible options, of which the question asks which one the sentence indicates is a correct answer. \n2. The first option is spring. Spring is the time when planting is done; this makes sense as the \"it\" in question, but isn't exactly an indicator of incompetence, since it may merely mean that the plant didn't survive. \n3. Fall, summer, and winter are not part of the question or answer. \n4. Lastly, autumn is the season \"she\" is \"on to something,\" so the statement makes sense. \n5. The answer is simple: only option E, autumn, can fulfil both criteria, being both relevant and indicative of incompetence.\nAnswer: E; autumn", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "had a plant, it died. Choices:  A is: she has a weak plant B is: she could be careless C is: she could be patient D is: poor communication E is: bad maintenance\nRationales: First, understand the question and the sentence. The question asks what the statement tells us about the subject. \n1. The subject doesn't have a \"green thumb\" because her plants never grow or live long enough for any thumb to turn green.\n2. To understand the phrase \"she thought she had a plant\", recall that a \"plant\" symbolically refers to a relationship or aspect of someone's life, and the subject doesn't have any healthy or long-lasting relationships in life. \n3. The rest of the sentence implies that \"every time she thinks she has a plant\" implies that she thinks she's started a relationship for example. However, when she thinks she starts a relationship or has a new one, it always dissolves or dies.\n4. Now consider each choice.\n5. A suggests the subject has a weak plant or unhealthy relationships because a weak plant would die, but not a green plant. It doesn't make sense in the context.\n6. B suggests the subject could be careless. The sentence says she thinks she has a relationship, but it's never actualized or maintained due to the careless actions that led to the eventual demise or death. This interpretation could be correct, but isn't very strong or clear. \n7. C suggests the subject is patient. The sentence has no information about her patience or attitude about these relationships. Patience doesn't add enough detail to the story or reasoning to be a possible answer choice. \n8. D suggests that the subject's relationships could have communication issues. This could be a viable theory, but there are other possibilities that might also account for her relationships never lasting long.\n9. E suggests the subject has poor maintenance. It's possible her relationships failed because of her poor management or lack of effort. This option fits the context but it's just one of many potential explanations.\n10. The most comprehensive answer is E.\n11. It is the most comprehensive because it is supported by the most information from the sentence, and it's also viable because it's the only option that can't be explained by another answer", "answer": " 135"}

Option B: water them once\n2. Option C: water one day per month\n3. Option B: too little\n4. Option C: too slow\n5. Option D: water too much \n6. Option A: B might work, but it might also be too little.\n7. Option B might be too much.\n8. Option C might be too much or too slow.\n9. Option D might be too much. \n10.

Choices:  B: nothing  C: it all matters  D: it all matters anyway  E: some things matter\nRationales: Choice D: it all matters could be eliminated as the sentence says that they can learn it all matters anyway.\nHence, it is irrelevant to the choice of open door policy and can be skipped.\nAnswer: C (it matters a lot) \n\nInput: One of the person's last names is McDonald, what other possible last names can they have?

{"text": "found a job she was wrong. Choices:  A. No job  B. Bad boss C. She never got hired D. Bad relationship  E.

The question asks us where a person may store food while at school.\nWe can then analyze the different choices and determine what the best option is to store food at school. \nOption A: the fridge is typically used for storing perishable items such as fruits and vegetables. While a student might bring some fresh produce to school, there are more options for where they can store their food on campus. \nOption B: the cupboard is also an option for storing food at school. If there is a kitchen available on campus, the student could use the cupboard provided. \nOption C: the backpack is not suitable for storing food at school since it's not secure and can be easily lost or stolen. \nOption D: the lockers are not generally used for storing food at school either since they aren't secure and could open to anyone. \nOption E: the table is an option for storing food but not the best one.

{"text": "had enough she would get the idea to cut it again Choices:  A green thumb B: green plant C: plant  D: green E: cut\nRationales: The question refers to a person who lacks the talent to successfully grow plants. They are unskilled and likely to make mistakes while trying, but don\u2019t seem to be able to achieve success even after several attempts. So, the answer should represent this person's inability to grow plants, making it seem that their thumbs were actually green. \nStart by resolving each option.\n\n1. If the person does have a \"green thumb\" (choice A), then they're likely to be proficient at planting and growing plants. They'd likely achieve success more often than not, and have some success despite multiple attempts. This option doesn't match the person being described.\n2. \"Green plants\" or \"plant\" (choice B, C, D, respectively) simply refers to the color green. There's no reason that a green thumb would be specifically reflected in plants that have a green color. This also doesn't represent the person being described. \n3. Choice E: cut. This makes sense because cutting plants could mean they're unsuccessful at growing plants, which is what the question is about.\n4. So, if a green thumb refers to the color green rather than being successful at planting, then the only possible answer is E: cut.\nAnswer: E cut", "answer": " 23"}

A: Insufficent sunlight. \n8. Sunlight is an essential factor for flower growth. Insufficient sunlight would cause the flowers to blacken over time. \n9. B: Inconsistencies in watering.\n10. Flowers require consistent and adequate watering to grow healthily. \n11. C: Invasives species.\n12. Invasive species are plants that grow quickly and take over territory, causing competition with traditional plants. \n13. D: Shady environments.\n14. Shady environments can be an issue unless the plants can tolerate low light intensities. \n15. Therefore, the most likely answer is E: A combination of all three.\nAnswer: E- the answer is a combination of the three.\n\nInput: What type of building requires the most time to complete?

{"text": "got it right she ________. Choices:  A. pulled it out B. went back to the drawing board C. dug into it D. made coffee E. planted it\nRationales: First, consider the question. We're told that the person did not have a green thumb, but they thought they had got it right. This suggests that they may have done something to improve their gardening skills and attempted to do it again.\n\nNow, we are given a number of options that could describe this scenario.\n\nOption A: pulls it out. This implies removing something, which doesn't fit well with the idea of trying to improve one's gardening skills.\n\nOption B: going back to the drawing board. This can be interpreted as starting from the beginning or having to redo something, which could fit with the intention of attempting to improve one's skills and then trying again.\n\nOption C: dig into it. This could potentially signify a deeper level of research or study, which could be linked to improving one's skills in the same way that going back to the drawing would represent doing it all over again.\n\nOption D: made coffee. This is not relevant and doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption E: planted it.This does not appear to be a suitable answer choice because it would suggest planting something, but we're told that she did this and it didn't work, so it doesn't make sense that she'd continue to plant things if it didn't work.\n\nConsidering all these options, the answer would be option B. She went back to the drawing, which would fit with the context of trying to improve one\u2019s gardening skills. This would allow one to start fresh and make progress, as planting, or making coffee, would not represent success or improvement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the answer is option B.", "answer": " 66"}

Choices: 1: A: bake bread 2: B: cook 3: C: learn gardening 4: D: grow plants 5: E: raise animals\nRationales: There are several important points to consider when answering this question. The first key concept is to understand the context of the problem. The question describes a situation where the character has been unsuccessful at growing flowers, and as a result, has given up on growing flowers altogether.\n1. Step 1: The answer is a statement.\n2. Step 2: The answer is in the context of a general situation.\n3. Step 3: Find and evaluate the relationship between the statement and the situation.\n4. As noted above, the character has given up on growing her flowers. We should therefore consider what the character might do, given this situation.\n5. Consider the five answer choices.\n6. The answers could be either positive or negative, depending on the context and the relationship between the statement in the question and the context in general. \n7. We could evaluate answers using either positive or negative judgements: if the statement \"She stopped growing plants\" applies positively, we could say that the character has made a positive change and is now able to focus on things that she enjoys, such as baking or learning. Conversely, if the statement \"She killed her flowers\" applies negatively, we could say that it suggests more negative consequences on the character's future behavior and choices, perhaps leading to poor health or financial struggles.\n8. Ultimately, the answer to the question \"What would she do?\" depends on the context and relationship between the statement and situation, and by evaluating the answers using positive or negative judgments, we can determine if the choices are accurate reflections of the situation.\nAnswer: B", "answer": " 850,000"}

Bonsai - they are not supposed to grow.\n2. Fruit Trees - these are not likely to be affected by the carelessness of the person. But even if fruits grew the amount would be so small that the person wouldn't consider it a flower.\n3. Mint - it was mentioned that the plant \"came up as a flower\" so it was something that grew. \n4. Flowers - it was also mentioned that the plant \"grew as a flower\", so it was something that grows. \n5. Herbs - they are usually grown for their specific purpose and not flowers. Herbs are not supposed to \"come-up\" since they are something one grows for specific use.  \n6.

The first step after interpreting the structure of the question is to determine if the answer is \"yes\", \"no\", or \"don't know.\"\n2. Look at each possible answer: it is not the most hardy. This is a type of succulent, so this can't be correct.\n3. No water is incorrect because we know it did not die due to lack of water.\n4. Sunlight is incorrect, as the green thumb is mentioned, and she was not trying to grow it in a greenhouse.\n5. It was in the wrong soil: incorrect because this question asks about sunlight and water, so this is not related. \n6.

Then, interpret the meaning of the response options, A to E in order to understand which one is correct.\n3. Choice A: Not doing homework is not related to the phrase \"sure couldn't have\", so this is not the correct answer option.\n4. The same is true of Choice B: Not taking care of plants, as this does not reflect the negative connotation of \"sure didn' t have\".\n5. Choice C: Not growing plants may reflect the negative meaning since it implies a lack of success in this area, but it's still not the correct answer. \n6. ChoiceD:Not Watering Plants \n7. Choice C: No Watering Plants is the correct answer. The phrase implies that She Sure Didn't Have a \"green thumb\" \n8. The answer choices should represent what She was doing that led to her lack of success in growing plants. The sentence's focus is on what she was doing wrong.\n9. In other words, watering plants is what the focus of the problem is on.\n10. Therefore, the answer option should be Choice C:\n11. She Sure Didn' t Know How To Water Her Plants\n12. Therefore, the correct response is Choice D:\n13. She Sure Didn 't Know How To Water Plants\n14. The same rationale applies for Choice E: Not Knowing How To Water Plants since this accurately identifies what \"She Sure Didn 't Have A Green Thumb\" means. The focus is on what she wasn't doing to maintain her plants, implying that it was not her expertise or experience in a skill such as knowing how to water plants.\nAnswer: \nChoice D & Choice E\n\nInput: You asked for the cheapest option; what is a person likely doing at that time?

{"text": "was done gardening it turned into a flowerpot? Choices:  P: garden  Q: flowerpot  R: gardening  S: flowerpot\nRationales: The question asks for a sentence to describe her skill in gardening.\n1. Each sentence should describe a quality or characteristic related to gardening.\n2. Reading through each of the choices, \"P: garden\" is not a quality of gardening. It could be where one gardens, but not an attribute of the practice itself.\n3. \"Q: flowerpot\" is related to gardening, but not necessarily a quality of gardening, therefore, this is not the correct answer choice.\n4. Reading through \"R: gardening\", we can determine that a garden may produce flowerpots, but it does not represent a quality of gardening in its own right, so this sentence choice is not valid.\n5. \"S: flowerpot\" is grammatically incorrect, as the correct form for sentences in this manner is \"Q: flowerpot,\" therefore, this is not an acceptable answer.\n6.

Consider each possible answer:\nA : cares for\nWe can eliminate choice A: cares for because this person did a bad job taking care of the plant before it died. \nB: didn't care\nWhile the person didn't necessarily love the plant, they may have at least tried to take care of it. This is not the case since they had no real interest at all in the plant, making this choice not feasible. We can eliminate this choice. \nC : did nothing\nThis is a viable option since the person did not do anything to take care of the plant. However, the person did not think of planting them at all until the day the plant died. This also does not match up with the given details of the situation, so this can be eliminated. Additionally, it does not fit the context of the question since the context refers to the fact that plants died so \"doing nothing\" does not fit the question at all.\nD : dirt\nWe must determine if this is a negative or a positive option when it comes to the plant's health. If it is bad dirt that is rotting the plant and killing it, then D: Dirt is an acceptable answer. \nE : was poisoned\nWe know that the plant died due to the person failing to take good care of it. This could be a positive or a negative situation. \nIf the plant was poisoned, then it would die; this choice is an acceptable answer.\nHowever, we know that the person did not intentionally poison the plant, so we can eliminate choice E: Was poisoned.\nTherefore the best choice is choice D: dirt.\nAnswer: D : dirt\n\nInput: People have to pay to go on the train, they aren't free, although you can pay to skip and not have to pay for the ride.

We're looking at what would happen if new dirt was added to the soil so it could support plant life. \n2. We examine the statement \"They would all wither and dry, every time she thought that she would do it.\" The first step is to establish that the new dirt would be used in an area where the same plant is expected to live. 3. This would be a garden, and in a garden, one common practice is to use the same type of plants. It is logical to assume that using the same species of plant would mean that the same soil would be required for all the plants. \n4. Option A is incorrect because it implies that some type of dirt is present, causing the plants to thrive. \n5. Option B is incorrect because it states that fertilizers are insufficient to sustain plant life, and we know that plant life would require nutrients to be successful. \n6. Option C is incorrect because it claims that the person would be successful at gardening if the plants were different. \n7. Option D is incorrect because it claims the plants would thrive if a different type of plant was used. 8. Since the statement \"they would all wither and died\" indicates that using soil, plants, and fertilizer would fail, the only other option that would provide different results is option E, which says that a green thumb wouldn't indicate one to be successful at gardening and would not guarantee success. \n9. Option E cannot be correct because \"A green thumb\" refers to a person's ability to garden rather than their experience or their knowledge. \n10. The only remaining possibility is option B: Fertilizers wouldn't provide enough nutrition to support plant life, which is the correct answer.", "answer": " 14"}
{"text": "was watering the weeds the plants didn't grow. Choices:  A. She was dehydrated  B. She was thirsty  C. She was drunk  D. She was tired  E. She didn't know what she was doing\nRationales: As water is needed to grow weeds, lack of water causes the weeds to become dry (dehydrated) and die if the water doesn't come again.\nThe sentence says \"the plants didn't grow.\" If someone is already drunk (C) to have watered the weeds, they probably shouldn't be attempting to do so\n(D) If someone was tired (D) from watering the weeds, that person won't be able to water them (because they were dehydrated,) and hence, the plants won't grow.\nIf a person is drunk they probably won't be able (E) to water the weeds, and even if they did try, they wouldn't know what they were doing (B).\nHence the correct answer is B.

{"text": "had mastered a new dish, she ended up with a red face, is what she did wrong? Is choice: A B C D or E, answer: A\nRationales: Input: She sure didn' t have a green thumb, is what she did was wrong? 1. The first thing of note is the tone of the sentence. It suggests that the person didn't know what they were doing and is still trying to learn. This should be considered in any response given. \n2. Next, identify each word in the sentence - \"She, sure, had, a, green, thumb, wasn' t, and is, did, was, wrong?\"\n3. \"Had\" doesn't refer to any specific situation so it can be omitted.\n4. \"Wasn' t\" can be inferred as \"didn't have\", so the phrase can be rewritten as \"She, sure, wasn't, having, a, green, Thumb.\"\n5. \"Is\" is a repetition of the first \"is\" in the original statement, so it can also be omitted. \n6. \"Didn' t\" means \"didn't\"; the word \"did\" will be used to refer to the person's actions or behavior, which makes the sentence \"She, sure, didn't, have, a, green, thum,\" - however, it is clear that some elements must be omitted to achieve the desired result.\n7. \"Was\" refers to the action of \"having\" or possessing something, which is not relevant in this case, so it can be omitted as well.\n8. \"Wrong\" is an opinion that refers to the actions of the person; the sentence could also imply that they did the right things to achieve their goal, so any opinion should be kept in mind when determining the correct answer.\n9. Finally, the end result should be the sentence \"She, surely, did, a, green, thing.\" This word can be reused by replacing \"did the right things\" with \"had a green thumb\" for better flow.\n10.

{"text": "was doing right. Choices:  A. The plant died  B. Didn't know what she was doing  C. Couldn't keep it alive  D. Didn't give it enough water  E. Got the sun\nRationales: First, understand the question to identify the pattern of the sentence. The sentence structure is \"She sure didn't have\", followed by a list of answers about what she did wrong. \n1. Now, interpret the answer choices. We can already eliminate some as not making any sense in the context of the sentence. \n2. It's possible that the first list of answers were not really what she thought was \"right,\" as they were all related to doing wrong. \n3. It would be possible that the answer A: \"the plant died\" meant that she thought she was doing things right, but the plant still died. This is not a consistent pattern with the other answers, so we can rule it out on that basis alone. \n4. However, it is possible that the answer A is the correct one, and we can eliminate D: \"didn't give it enought water\" because there are more consistent answers. \n5. Similarly, option C: \"couldn't keep it inviwe\" doesn't seem like a consistently phrased possibility, and it would be plausible that someone believes they are doing things right, while not actually understanding what they are doing. \n6. This means that the remaining answers are all plausible and can potentially be the answer. \n7. Therefore, we need to further analyze the choice A: \"the plant die.\" \n8. A: \"plant\" is a noun, while the rest of the answer is an action verb \"Didn't die.\" This could mean that the plant did die, since it's the noun part of the sentence. However, this isn't explicitly what the sentence is asking. \n9. Therefore, since there is less obvious support for this option, we can further assess the others. \n10. The remaining answers are E: \"got the sun\" and B: \"didn'thave a green thumb.\" Let's compare each choice against the pattern of the list from the original context. \n11.

{"text": "planted she killed the plant. Choices:  A. Green B. Blue C. White D. Brown E. Purple\nRationales: First, note that this is an analogy question. The word \u201cthought\u201d in the question implies that the plant was not actually green, but the respondent imagined it was. \n1. Starting with choice A, \"green thumb\", we can see this is the literal color of the thumb and not related to being able to tell if someone has a green thumb. Therefore, this is the incorrect choice.\n2. A few steps later, we get to choice B, \"blue thumb\". This is similarly not related to an actually blue thumb. \n3. The next choice is C, \"white thumb\". The thumb of someone with a \"white thumb\" would be the same color as the person. \n4. D, \"brown thumb\", is the color of someone with a brown thumb. This is also not related to our initial question. \n5. Last choice is E, \"purple thumb\". This is the only choice that shares the color of the imaginary thumb described. \n6.

Bringing a bigger trash can (Choice B) does not help them raise their grade, it simply reduces the amount of waste produced - which is probably not the problem here.\n2. The same applies to Choice C: getting better students won't raise the grade. \n3. Choice D: changing the desks is likely to worsen the situation if the desks are already small, and there's no indication that the desks are in need of change.\n4. To raise the grade, we need to change something that directly impacts the grade.

So, obviously, she plants a flower. \nHowever, this is not true, as the sentence continues by explaining that she has to take the plant outside again. \nThis is not a problem because the text then continues with describing the soil and the pot.\nHowever, this is still not an issue, as pot can refer to a container that holds plants, not soil (the other part of the text).

The phrase \"kill the plant\" means to destroy the plant, often through neglect or improper treatment. \n1. Choice A. indicates that the person used the plant too frequently, which is inconsistent with her killing it. It would be more likely that she killed it by overwatering it in the opposite direction.\n2.

Choice D. indicates that she watering incorrectly and doesn't support the conclusion that she killed the plant.\n5.

D: she would always bring the seeds to the same sunny spot outside. E: she wouldn't let a plant die if she had an opportunity to save it CORRECT\nRationales: First, understand the question: She didn't have a \"green thumb\" because she struggled in gardening, especially when planting seeds.\nWe consider each option:\n1. Option A: She would bring the seeds outdoors. This is not a guarantee to success with gardening, as many other factors such as soil quality, temperature, and water availability can also affect the growth of plants.\n2. Option B: She would not give up trying even after she made mistakes. While this could be a sign of perseverance, it does not necessarily mean that she's better at gardening than most people. \n3. Options C: She would always water the seeds when she thought they looked dry. While this could be good gardening technique, it doesn't indicate that she would definitely produce healthier plants or a green thumb.\n4. Option D: She would always bring the seated to the same sunny area outside. While this could be beneficial for growing plants, it does not guarantee the plant will grow or that she has a green thumb. \n5. Option E: She wouldn't want a plant to die if she had the opportunity to save it. While this seems like a good trait for gardening, it doesn't necessarily mean she would have a green thumb. 6.

First, understand what \"She sure didn\u2019t have a green thumb\" means. It means that she lacked skill when it came to gardening and that the results of her gardening endeavors were not favorable.\n2. The question asks us what would happen whenever \"she thought she was done garden...\"\n3. We now must consider all the answer choices.\n4. Water it (Choice A): This is not a problem because water is necessary for plants to thrive and will not cause harm if done regularly.\n5. Cut flowers (Choice B): Cutting flowers causes them to wilt and die but may be necessary to achieve a particular look or style.\n6. Fertilize (Choice C): This is not recommended because fertilizer can be harmful to plant health if not used correctly.\n7. Pull weeds (Choice D): This may cause damage to the soil and could potentially uproot a plant if done carelessly.\n8. Water it again (Choice E): Although watering the plants might be necessary, it will not harm them if done regularly or in moderation.\n9. This leaves us with either choice D or E: \"pulling weeds\" or \"watering the plants again\".

E: flower\nRationales: The question asks about the possible reason why someone gave up trying to grow plants.\n1. A \"green thumb\" relates to an ability to grow plants and care for them, so we need to determine if this person had or lacked such a ability.\n2. Starting with option B (Garden Cress):\n3. While garden cress can be grown at home, it's more commonly used in greenhouses or gardens. However, it's still possible to grow garden cress at home, so eliminating option B is not necessarily valid.\n4. Now considering option C (Tomatoes):\n5. Tomatoes are a popular addition to gardens and can be easily grown at home. While it's not required to have a green thumb to grow tomatoes, it may be more difficult for someone who does not have a green thumb.\n6. Next, option D (Pumpkin):\n7. Pumpkins are a common feature of Halloween decorations and are relatively easy to grow.\n8. Option E (Flower) is not a reason for someone to stop growing plants, so it's unnecessary to consider.\n9. As we consider each of the options above, we can eliminate them from the list based on how well they fit the criteria for the question.\n10. Starting with option A (Pot Plant):\n11. There's a possibility that a \"green thumb\" could be used to refer to any plant, but the phrase \"She sure didn't have,\" combined with the use of \"She\" in the first sentence, indicate that this is more likely a person.\n12. Also, Pot Plants refer to plants that are commonly grown indoors, which is different from garden plants. A Pot Plant would typically not require the same level of care or handling that would be required to grow a large garden of plants. \n13.

In this question, the answer required is the number of times the person failed. To calculate this number, we need to convert units from a fraction to the corresponding equivalent decimal number.\nThe second step is to identify the data points that will be useful in understanding the situation. We see that there are four data points that may help us determine the number of failures. \nThe third step is to make a hypothetical list of all possible values.

We can conclude which number fits the situation. \nThe final step is to choose the best option among the possible options. Choice B can be eliminated based on information in step 2; this number cannot be the number of failures, since there can only be one failure, since the person is unable to grow anything.\nThe fifth step is to calculate the best choice and choose the answer that most suitably fits the question. \nAnswer: A: 26.3\n\nInput: She was late to work for the fourth time in a row, how long did she stay home?

The sentence implies that the woman who didn't have a \"green thumb\" had something in mind, but failed.\n2. The intended meaning of \"she didn't have a 'green thumb'... is that she didn't have the natural ability to keep plants healthy and thriving, despite her best efforts. \n3. The possible answers need to relate to her \"best efforts\" - her actions, not her failure. \n4. Option A: She cut the flowers. It is unclear what the woman intended but, this choice doesn't make sense because \"best efforts\" are unlikely to include cutting flowers. \n5. Option B: She forgot to water. Watering plants is one of the basic, essential actions needed to keep them alive, so this would be unusual for someone who is making a \"best effort.\" \n6. Option C: She forgot to harvest. While a person who is trying hard to keep plants healthy, is likely to harvest the fruit, this action is not unique or particularly outstanding. In other words, it's not likely that a person who is attempting to grow healthy plants would forget to harvest their fruit, which is very common for those who do not take care of their plants well.\n7.

In the store, you can see that some of the items have been placed in a specialized section for that product. \nRationales: There's information about an item in the library if one is looking for a book; in a farmer's market from vendors selling local products; at a supermarket with many different and unique items available, and; finally, in a store with specific sections and places for items. A: Libraries may have books with related information about specific items or topics, but this isn't necessarily a given, and isn't guaranteed.\nA: Farmers' markets provide a source of local produce and products, but may not have specific information on items.\nA: Supermarkets may contain specialized sections, but these will generally be broad-reaching, not item-specific.\nA: In the store, you may be able to find specific sections and places for certain items, but this isn'y guaranteed.\nD: So, the best answer is D: Store.\n\nInput: __________ a place to go when thinking about how to solve a tough problem. Choices: A. Talk to a friend about it. B. Check and think. C. Look for ideas. D. Take it to the next chapter.\nRationales: _________.\nA: If someone is trying to solve a problem, a friend might be helpful in providing some insight or brainstorming, but wouldn't usually be the first place they'd turn when attempting to solve a problem.\n\nB: Think and check could be useful for a person trying to solve a problem.

{"text": "planted more seeds in her vegetable garden, it seemed like she killed them. Choices:  A. never B. always C. always killed most D. always growing E. always healthy\nRationales: There are few ways to interpret this question, but the answer is A. never.\n1. First, consider each option.\n2. A: Never seems very unlikely as this is the definition of \"always\"; it will have all of the traits associated to \"always.\" \n3. B: Always is impossible too because of the meaning of the first sentence.\n4. C: always killed most could be a plausible answer, but it doesn't account for what seemed to happen to the seeds each time.\n5. D: If she always killed the seeds growing and only killed the seeds growing, it would make sense to choose E.\n6. E: This is not quite the same either as the meaning of always being the same thing. In this situation, it would actually imply always healthy, meaning it never turned bad, it was just always healthy and always growing.\n7. The only answer that makes sense is A: never, that is, it wasn't always the same thing.\nAnswer: A. never\n\nInput: They built their treehouse, but did they realize where they could attach it? Choices: 1. On the left 2. On the right 3. On the south 4. On the north 5. Straight up 6.

On the north = false\n5. Straight up = true\n6. Anywhere = false\nThe right answer is Number 5, Straight up, because one does not have to know the details of the question or consider all options or details.\nYou are looking for the only answer that is true of the whole question.\nAnswer: 5.

{"text": "had it planted, it bloomed. What was her problem? Choices:  C: unfit for gardening D: doesn't have a backyard E: poor planting skills F: doesn't have the right environment G: doesn't have any patience\nRationales: Here are three important strategies to follow:  **Consider each option carefully** - We must look closely at each answer choice and examine the evidence provided to determine if it is a valid answer.\n1. She had bad luck - we are only presented with evidence indicating that she failed due to bad luck; we don't know anything about her skill or skill level or the circumstances of the planting.\n\n2. Maybe she tried pot, and it didn't work out  - if she was trying pot, does this make her unfit for gardening? This doesn't seem credible and can be ruled out.\n\n3. Her garden is located in hell  - assuming that hell is the opposite of a green thumb, this may be relevant but it can also be ruled out based on the evidence.\n\n4. Her planting skills were lacking  - if her planting skills were poor, could she bloom the plant by accident? This seems unlikely.\n\n5. Her planting skills seemed pretty good. When she thought she had it, she certainly planted it right.  - this answer is the best choice, as there is evidence to support her planting skills.\n\n6. Her garden was in a very bad environment  - this answer requires evidence to support it. Is this supported by the text? If her garden is located in hell, it's pretty hostile and is not a good environment.\n7. The text doesn't state if she doesn't have the proper patience. It does state that she has no luck. Unless we have more evidence, we can eliminate this option as well.\n\nThis leaves us with choice C: unfit for the job. If the job requires specific skills that the person lacks, they are not fit for the position. Therefore, C: unfit is the most likely answer.\nAnswer: C \n\nInput: What kind of toy should they get, if they had to make it rain?

{"text": "was doing what on her plants? Choices:  C: killing them D: overfeeding them E: fertilizing them F: underwatering them\nRationales: First, understand the question and make an educated guess. Each of four options will be used to describe the actions she takes on her plants.\nStep 1: Find the context clues. What plants does she work with? How does she interact with them?\nStep 2: Eliminate choices that do not match the context. \nStep 1: The question asks us to understand the question and make a guess, not to find a specific clue that matches the correct answer. So it's better to start from the first step and find clues throughout the passage.\nStep 2: Choices C, D, F are not used anywhere, so we can eliminate them.\nChoice A: Does not provide us any detail about how she behaves with plants.\nChoice B: Does not describe what she does with the plants at all.\nStep 3: Select the choice that most likely matches the answer. \nStep 2 is finished, so we can find the answer in step 3.\nStep 3 starts with reviewing the first step and continuing with steps 4 and 5.\nStep 4: In the first step, eliminate other choices, so let's look at the remaining choices carefully.\nStep 5: Consider the context of where she interacts with plants, and match the choice which best describes her actions.\nStep 4 is finished, consider this section when trying to find the answer in step5. When comparing A with B, C, D, F, remember the purpose of the passage and use the details to describe the action.\nStep 5 is finished, and we can find the answer is C: killing them.\nAnswer: C. killing them\n\nInput: She wants to visit her parent's.

{"text": "was going to have another flower she sure killed it. Choices:  A (green thumb, have): 1. green thumb B (have, another): 2. 1 green flower\nRationales: It doesn't matter the order it's done, the correct order of the choices in order is: \nStep 1: Inserting the \"their\" instead of the \"she\" to make the choice B, 1 green flower.\nStep 2: Check the choices: 1). green thumb, have (choice A) is the correct answer. The first part of the sentence (the green thumb,) makes mention of the green thumb, and implies that it is a special ability to be able to grow flowers. The second part of the sentence (have,) also directly references the green thumb as being something that they have. The sentence in question isn't asking about green thumb, but it references it because it is an important component that the reader needs to comprehend.\nStep 3: So, the answer is choice A, green thumb, have.\nAnswer: A (green thumb, will have): 1. The green thumb.\n\nInput: What kind of wood is hard to carve? Choices:  B (hard, carve): 2. metal C (hard, carve) : 3. metal\nRationales: From the sentence given, it is clear that the term \"hard to carve\" is a phrase used instead of \"hard to carve [wood] into\". \nStep 1 : We check through the choices until we come across metal. Metal is commonly used because of its easy molding into various shapes. \nStep 2 : Hence, the answer to choice: C (hard to carve), metal is the correct choice.\nAnswer: C (hard, carving: 3.

{"text": "had a winning plant, something died. Choices:  A. watering B. fertilizing C. cutting D. mushroom poisoning E. asexual reproduction\nRationales: If you're looking at the answer choices, then you can say it's very easy to tell what 'green thumb' refers to, at least by its description. Green thumb refers to those who can grow plants to maturity without much effort and skill. \nIn the rest of the description, we have green thumb, and then'something died'. This part of the statement is somewhat counterintuitive to green thumb since it's very hard to imagine plants dying without a green thumb. \nIdeally, once you've realized that, the remaining answer choices can be eliminated with just two questions: 1. Are they related to plants growing, in any form? If you answered yes, then they could be related to asexual reproduction.\n\nAnswer: E: asexual reproduction", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": "was doing a great job, it turned all brown. Choices:  A B C D E \nRationales: The answer should be the option that is most likely to represent the idea stated in the sentence. Option A is not a feasible choice, because a green thumb is typically associated with having a knack for growing healthy plants. This does not match the context of the sentence, where the woman does not seem to be succeeding at her endeavor.\nAs for option B, it is not a feasible answer, as it does not match the context provided in the sentence. Green thumbs are typically associated with good gardening, not bad ones.\nMoving on to option C, it is not a viable answer as it is not a word that is commonly used in this context and does not match the narrative tone of the sentence.\nThe same can be said for option D, which does not fit the context provided in the passage.\nFinally, option E is not a feasible option, as it does not directly match the idea stated in the passage.\nIn summary, the best answer choice for this question is option E. It directly matches the context provided in the question and is a word that is commonly associated with that context.\n\nAnswer: E: brown\n\n\n### Reference\n\n>https://www.quora.com/What-would-you-ask-for-in-order-to-write-a-good-response-to-an-instruction-answer-the-following-grade-math-question", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "did, she always brought them to their knees. What was it? Choices:  ________, green_grass\nRationales: She surely doesn't have a green, but what else does she do? What is \"THEM\"?  The answer is in reference to what she does to plants. The question is looking for clues to discover what \"THEM\" means, and there are many opportunities to do this in the context. \nFirst, we'll check what happens when plants are brought to \"their knees\".\n\n1. Plants are usually brought to their knees when they are overwatered, and \"she\" is not described as taking special care to water the plants appropriately, so this is likely not what is intended.\n\n2. Plants are also subjected to more sunlight when they're brought to their knees, but here the plant was likely placed indoors, so exposure to the sun was likely minimal.\n\n3. Plants can be brought to their knees and die if water is not provided regularly. \"She\", however, was shown taking care to make sure the plants received water.\n\n4. Plants can be overwatered resulting in waterlogging, which would bring them to their knees, however, the given description, \"every time\" suggests the problem occurred repeatedly, which is unlikely with overwatering. Another option is that it relates to using too much fertilizer, which could lead to toxic accumulation and death.\n\n5. A different option is that the plants were not watered regularly, which could bring them to their knee. However, the given statement \"she thinks she does\" implies that \"she\" didn't do this intentionally, so in this case, it doesn't fit and can be eliminated. \n\n6. Fitness is not related to what \"she\" is doing, though it may seem like a plausible answer at first glance. \n\n7. Food can mean either food for animals or what people eat, and neither of these are relevant, so they can be eliminated.\n\n8. Gardening has little to do with the given statement \"she always brought them to their keens\" as \"gardening\" may mean growing plants, but it also means just about growing anything, including flowers, trees, vegetables, and fruits, which don'", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": "was watering the plants. Choices: A: did so B: kept on doing so C: kept watering D: continued doing E: kept on watering\nRationales: First step is to understand the intent. The phrase \"she thought she was watering\" implies that her actions were misguided and ineffective. The task is to identify the proper action. Let us eliminate the options which do not make sense in the context.\n1. Option A: did so. This option indicates a successful action so this is not the choice\n2. Option B: kept on doing [so]. Although this option is in the form of a present tense, it doesn't make sense grammatically. The sentence implies that her actions were not successful. The correct choice must contain an ineffective action.\n3. Option C: kept watering. Continuing to do what [is incorrect] is not likely to be the right answer\n4. Option D: continued doing [so]. Once again, this option is in the present tense but the correct action choice must be in the past tense\n5. Option E: kept on water ing [so]. Option E is similar to options C and D and like A and B fails to make sense as a grammatical structure.\n6. Based on the above considerations, it can be assumed that she watered them correctly, i.e. did not water them regularly or did not water in a way that was appropriate which was the option \"she kept watering\" i.e. B.\nAnswer: B. She kept watering.\n\nInput: What was needed to remove the dust? Choices: A: broom, B: dishes, C: vase, D: cat, E: snake\nRationales: Broom: A broom is used to sweep dust and dirt from floors and surfaces. The task is to clean something from dust and the question is in such a context and the choice \"broom\" is correct.\nDishes: Dishes are objects used to hold food or drink, and are typically not used for cleaning.\nVase: A vase is a container used to hold flowers or other objects, and could potentially be used to dust shelves or furniture, but is not a typical solution for dust removal.\nCat: a cat is an animal and cannot be used for removing dust.\nSnake: S", "answer": " 72"}
{"text": "was watering her plants, she was really watering the _______. Choices:  A. house B. mailbox C. bird bath D. car E. trees\nRationales: First of all, we've got to figure out what's happening here. The house, mailbox, car, and bird bath don't make the most sense. \nNext, we've got trees. The house, mail box, car, and birdbath aren't plants. \nThen, birds and water. We can probably agree that none of the people in the photo have a bird as a pet, so the second option is out. This is a clue towards the answer.\nLastly, plants. If we remember from the second clue above about birds and water, we can guess that the answer is plants. Therefore, the correct choice here is A: house.\nAnswer: A : house\n\nInput: What are children called in China? Choices: 1. A: brothers and sisters. B: nephews and nieces. C: grandkids. D: cousins. E: offspring.\nRationales: Before we can figure out the answer, we have to think about what children are known as in China: \nThe first clue is \"children\" in the question. Are kids not children in China? (I am not sure whether the plurality of children and brother and sisters could make the sentence above possible. Also in English children can be used to mean both singular and plural.) Therefore, if children are called brothers and sisters, the sentence is confusing. Also \"children\" would generally not refer to nephews and niece. Now, to get to the answer, from the sentence about offspring, I can only think of children that belong to a woman (as we don't have the question). Based on the first clue above, it must mean nephew or niece. Therefore the answer is (in English) \"nephews and nieces\" not \"grandkids\".\nAnswer: B: nephews, nieces\n\n### Demand:\nAnswer the following grade math questions.\n\n### Explanation:\n1.

Continue this cycle until you get to the end and have made all the correct choices.\nExample: Let\u2019s break down this question step-by-step.\nStep 1: Understanding the question:\nStep 2: What needs to be done (to eliminate options):\nThis question is asking us to find what is not true.\nStep 3: Assume a correct answer choice (if available):\nThis question asks whether a statement is accurate or not. When we read a question, we should interpret the word \"not\" as meaning \"contrary to.\" There are at least three types of options for the correct answer choice.\nStep 4: Find the most reasonable option (correctly):\nIn the first instance, the student guessed that Z is an incorrect answer choice. However, the student\u2019s previous reasoning was faulty. In this case, the incorrect answer choice was selected because it stated that dirt was the most probable correct answer choice, rather than the most incorrect one. This shows why it is important to confirm the correct response to each question before moving on to the next.\nStep 5: Record the correct answer:\nAs stated in step number one, it is important to record the answer selection in your response sheet. This will allow you to easily check your progress throughout the test and avoid any errors or misreads.\nStep 6: Review the reasoning:\nAt this stage of the test, it is important to take a final look at the question and confirm that the correct answer choice was selected.

{"text": "was going to see her flower's petaled, some bug came along, which one didn't she have? Choices:  *A*: a dog B: a cat C: a boy D: a ghost E: a wizard\nRationales: The question refers to a \"green thumb,\" a term used to describe a person's ability to successfully grow plants, flowers, or trees. In this context, it's not the literal thumb with a green color, but rather the characteristic of being able to grow things well. \n\nThe question goes on to state that every time she thought she had a blooming flower, bugs came along. This means she didn't succeed in growing anything successfully.\n\nIn order to deduce the correct answer, we need to consider our options for the type of creature the woman didn't have:\n\nOption A: dog: This is the literal interpretation of the word, but it doesn't make sense in this context because it would have no green color. \nOption B: cat: This can have some green coloration due to its fur, so it could be correct. \nOption C: boy: This is not relevant to either of the scenarios given. \nOption D: ghost: This also fits the scenario, as the woman thought she had blooming flowers and bugs came along; in other words, she thought she had a garden and found her plants infested.\nOption E: wizard: A wizard can be green, so this could be the correct answer. \nTo summarize, there are two possible answers: Option D: ghost and Option E: wizard. \nThe only logical explanation would be for this to be a riddle, where the answer would be a word or phrase that sounds the same as the question (like \"ghoti\" for \"f(r)i(g)h\") or has a similar-sounding meaning, like \"green thumb\" for \"not a dog.\" Therefore, the answer would be option D: ghost \n\n1.  The meaning is a ghost is someone who is not real, a fiction. The question was asking for the person's lack of success and the presence of something that wasn't there.\n2.

Option A:\" her plants were brown\" is not related to succeeding or failing.\n4. Option C:\"something bad happened\" is not related to the task of successfully growing plants, and it's vague.\n5. Option D:\"she thought of the weather\" is not related to successfully growing plants, and the sentence doesn't indicate anything about previous attempts.\n6. Option E:\"she realized she could plant tomato (sic)s at every end of summer\" indicates that she succeeded at growing tomatoes before. Even if this was a new plant, the option presents a successful past attempt, so this isn't the best answer.\n7.

For example, the answer \"Too hard\" may be true but probably not the best option because the statement indicates a problem with overwatering, not underwatering, while the answer \"Too many\" is not in the correct order. \nIn the end, the correct answer is B, \"Too many\" because it relates directly to the problem mentioned in the statement.\nAnswer: B, Too many.\n---", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "was nourishing the flower, the leaves just fell off and died? Choices: \nA: rainwater B: pests C: compost D: humidity E: direct sunlight\nRationales: First, understand the question: \n1. Every time something falls off or dies, it's removed. So, it doesn't \"just fall off and die.\" Somehow, this person is removing leaves and killing flowers.\n2. So, the question implies that the solution to this problem is adding some kind of nourishment, so we need to choose an option that is good for nourishing plants. \n3. The options are: rainwater, pests, compost, humidity, and direct sunlight. \n4. Rainwater contains nutrients that can nourish plants, making it a possibility. However, humidity and direct sunlight are environmental conditions that are conducive to plant growth, but are unlikely to be the cause of leaves falling off and dying. \n5. Pests can eat plants or cause them to become sick, which could explain why the leaves are dying. \n6. Compost is made from plant material and is usually added to soil as a form of nourishment, making it an option. However, compost itself does not contain moisture and can often cause plants to become less healthy if added in excessive amounts.\n7. There aren't clear clues in favor of any particular option, so we need to look for inconsistencies.\n8. Option C: compost. Compost can be made from plant material, so it's possible that it contains pests. \n9. Option E: direct sunlight. This option seems contradictory as the question states that leaves are falling off and dying, which is the opposite of what plants need to grow and flourish. So, this option cannot be the correct answer. \n10. Compost can be mixed with soil to help plants grow and nourish them. It can also be mixed with water to create compost tea. This can help improve the water quality by reducing nutrient pollution and providing valuable nutrients for plant growth. \n11. Therefore, the answer must be compost. \nAnswer: C: compost", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "could plant she would kill the flower? Choices:  C: flower D: tree E: garden  F: bushes\nRationales:\n1. First, understand what the question is implying. The phrase \"Sure didn't have a Green Thumb\" means that there is a strong disagreement about an individual's ability to successfully grow plants and flowers. This implies that whenever someone would attempt to grow a plant, they would fail, and the plant would not be capable of surviving.\n2. Now, consider how this failure could be related to the question.\n2. There are two possible answers: plant or flower. Plants typically grow in gardens, so we can eliminate the choice C: garden.\n3. Plants also require a green thumb which means having a garden needs to fit with the \"strong disagreement\" implied in the phrase. Hence, we can eliminate the choice E: garden.\n4. Now to move on to flowers. Flowers need to be watered regularly in order to survive. However, we have found that the problem is that whenever someone would attempt a plant they would kill it. So, this indicates that someone was not able to properly water the plant, meaning that a flower is the most probable answer.\n5. This means choice B: flower is the correct answer. \nAnswer: B: flower\n\nInput: The child could not be found, you couldn't see them or talk to them at all. You were searching for it for awhile, what had happened to them?

It only indicates that the person was looking.\nChoice B: Leaving the child could imply that the child is being left somewhere, but \u201ccould not find them or talk to them\u201d doesn\u2019t support the hypothesis that the child is being physically moved from one place to another.

Seeds are not necessary for growing plants, it's enough to use leaves. While a seed may be a necessary component for producing a full plant, for the purpose of growing plants on ones' own,  use of only leaves seems more appropriate.\n2. Leaves are sufficient for growing plants, so they will suffice for our purpose.\n3. Light, water, and soil are not the right answer since the plant growth was not successful.\n4. Water and soil are the necessary components for the growth of the plant.  Without them, the plant cannot survive.\n5. Water is the most likely answer, since without it, our plant will not survive.\n6. Answer: water.

A: No, because saying something to the police may involve the existence of a record in the first place.\nB: He could say it's okay for a reason other than \"they have a record\" so, the answer cannot be B: no.\nC: He could say he is too tired for a reason other than not remembering the event, so the answer cannot be C: no.\nD: He could have said nothing at all for a reason other than being unable to speak at all, so the answer can't be D: no.\nE: He can't talk for a reason other than no longer being able to speak at all, thus the answer cannot be E: no.\n\nIf the \"reason\" why he didn't say something to the police is \"e\", the entire argument falls apart and the correct answer is E: no", "answer": " 350"}

Choices:  * A: dolls * B: bikes * C: dressing up * D: doll houses * E: sports.\nRationales A: * \"Little sister\" is the focus of the question. Dresses, bikes and sports are all not related to \"little sister.\" We should eliminate choices A, B, and C, respectively. * D: Dressing up refers to something that people wear clothing, jewelry and other accessories. * E: Sports can bring fun and amusement to many children, but \"little sister\" probably doesn't enjoy them. Therefore, E is not an acceptable answer for this question.\n\nAnswer:\nChoice B: * Bikes can be dangerous and expensive toys. Therefore, bikes are most likely not played in a little girl's room. * The question is asking for something that little sister would play, not something that little brother play.\n\nInput: I've seen my mom buy peaches, what is the only fruit that can be bought in a whole or in a part.\nRationales : The question is asking for the only fruit that can buy in whole or in a piece.

The green thumb comes from gardening. \n1. It may be possible to grow a plant on her head but, if she didn't have the gardening ability, it would be a rather futile endeavor.\n2. The same is true of a garden if one does not have the skill to garden.\n3. A flower arrangement may not exactly require as much skill.\n4. It may be possible for her to create a beautiful flower garden in the countrysides, but that would still imply having a large garden, which may not be something that's feasible for some people.\n1.

{"text": "had one, the plant just died? Choices:  B: cactus C: lily D: aloe E: strawberry\nRationales:\n1. Answer options are given.\n2. Lily is a flower. Plants that have flowers are usually referred to as \"flowers,\" which leads us to understand that answer choices are plants that are distinct from flowers. \n3. Aloe is a type of plant that typically grows in dry, hot climates and is used medicinally for its gel-like substance.\n4. Strawberry is a fruit, not a plant.\n5. A cactus is a desert plant, not typically a plant that could be grown indoors.\n6. The last option is the correct answer, as \"green thumb\" is a term for having the ability to keep plants alive and thriving, even indoors. The phrase \"every time she thought she had...the plant just died\" implies that her lack of green thumb meant that she could not keep her plants alive, so the answer is C: lily.\nAnswer: C.\n\nInput: What can you find between 04:00am - 5:00pm on a clock? Choices :  A: 12:00 B: 11:59 C: 11:01 D: 12:31 E: 12:59\nRationales: We analyze each answer possibilities for the question \"What can you find between 4 am and 5 pm on a clock?\" Step 1. The first thing to do is to understand the question fully. We are interested in finding a time between two times with hours between 4-5 pm. This is quite easy to find. We could do it on the clock. The best option is the correct one. The others don't fit. Step 2. Considering the answer options: 1. 12:01 am is not an option because 12 pm is not between 4-5:00 pm. 2. 4 am does not fit either because there is no 12:05 pm in 4 pm-5 pm. 3. 5 am is excluded. 11am is not between 4 and 5 pm either. 4.

We start by eliminating incorrect options first, in this case Choices: A: fruit B: flowers, and E: weeds, as these options do not match the scenario described. \n3. Now let\u2019s look at Option B, flowers:\n4. Although this choice is also incorrect, it does raise a valid question: how else could \"roses\" and \"garden\" refer to something other than a garden of flowers?\n5.

The answer is C: leaves\nAnswer: C: leaves\n\nInput: She said she would be home for dinner tomorrow. She wouldn\u2019t be home when we arrived unless she was ___. Choices:  C E F A D B\nRationales: First, understand the question and consider available choices. \nStep 1: The phrase \"tomorrow\" implies a particular time in the future.

{"text": "would grow some flowers and plants they all died. Choices:  A. Sensibility B. Sensei C. Sense D. Dewy E. Decide\nRationales: Here are some examples that might help you understand this question. Let's say you are trying to grow plants. Every time you pick up a potted plant that you bought at the grocery store, you put it on your patio, and water it, it's wilting within days. This is a person who does not have a \"green thumb\". You can even say she has the opposite of the so-called 'green thumb'. \nSo, let's talk about these choices. Choice A is out of context. She doesn't have a sense of what she's doing - just because she can't grow plants doesn't mean she doesn't have a green'sense' of what she's planning to do. Choice B is out of context as well. She is not a martial arts sensei - let's just leave her out of this choice. \nChoice C doesn't make sense either because plants cannot 'decide' on what to grow. If her plants die, it's not because they decide to die - it probably died because it doesn't get enough sunlight, or water, or some nutrients - that's just how gardening works. \nChoice D has something to do with how you water the plants, right? It is actually something that the plants need. But this one is not contextually correct. Choice E is a word for choice, 'decide'. Now, if the plants do not die because they decide what to grow, that will mean the gardener will have a green 'dewy' thumb - that's how you decide if she has a 'green thumb' or not. \nAnswer: E: Decide\n\nInput: What job would a person take if they are looking to be a leader?

We need to determine what could be causing the marigolds to grow carrots, and consider whether it makes sense that the marigolds were overwatered. \nStep 2- Eliminate the inappropriate answers: As per the question, this person was trying to grow carrots but ended up growing marigolds instead. It is obvious that she was trying to grow carrot. Carrot plant is generally grown in the fields, so the answer A can be eliminated because we are growing it indoors. \nStep 7: Go with the obvious answer: It seems that the user was overwatering the plants, which resulted in the wrong plants growing, so the conclusion is that we have to stop overwatering.\nAnswer: 7: the answer is 7: \"stop overwatering.\"\n\nInput: What was she doing when her teacher realized she is still reading the previous lesson and it's 4 minutes left?

First, understand the context: it's about a person who didn't have a \"green thumb,\" referring to their supposed ability to maintain plant life and care for them. The second is the conclusion, \"when she thought she could make bonsai she ended them up killing them.\" This can be interpreted as an indication that the character in the story will be talking about killing a bonsai. This indicates that the answer will be related to the term \"bonsai.\" \n1. Consider each choice individually: A, B, C, D, and E.\n2. Option A: green, this term is not likely to be mentioned in the context and is unlikely to be related to the term bonsai.\n3. Option B: plant, this doesn't refer to bonsai in particular, making it a plausable answer.\n4. Option C: orange. Similar to option B, this refers to plant life in general.\n5. Option D: purple. This is a different color than plant life, and unlikely to be used when describing a plant.\n6. Option E: none of the answers, this is a way to show that there's no indication of a specific answer in the context.\n7.

Analyzing the context of the problem should help determine what each choice means.\n3. The answer needs to express the idea about which option does not apply to the intended meaning.\n4. The answer will need to be either one of the choices or the response itself.\n5. Choice A: has a green thumb. The intended meaning of green thumb is that someone has the ability to grow plants or tend to a garden well. Someone who has a green thumb does not have an issue growing plants.\n6. Choice B: has a brown thumb This suggests a person has issues growing or caring for plants. This choice does not fit the intended meaning of the sentence.\n7. Choice D: has a white thumb. This suggests the person has difficulties identifying colors of flowers or distinguishing colors of the flowers. This does not indicate problems with plant growth.\n8. Choice E: has a yellow-tipped The intended meaning of green fingers suggests that someone has problems in growing plants or caring for plants, a common problem that suggests a lack of success.\n9. Choice C: doesn\u2019t have a green thumb does not mention anything about plant growth or caring for plants so it does not fit the intended intended meaning\n10.

We can start by eliminated the incorrect answers. \n3. A: a pot of dirt is not an item a person would typically plant.\n4. B: a flower and some mulch is a combination of soil and mulch; therefore, we can eliminate this choice.\n5. C: same as B choice - this is also not an actual plant.\n6. D: a seed, some water, sunlight - The choice implies planting a seed, but it doesn't give enough information about what the seed is, and the water and sun are not specific enough. \n7. If there was a specific seed that needed water and sunlight (option D's missing information), that could be a possible answer.\n8. However, this phrase doesn't refer to a specific type of seed; it's just something she thought she could plant. So, the most likely answer is E: a weed and grass to contain it. \n9.

If we plant seeds with the idea of growing a garden, we expect fresh and green leaves, not a dry and wilted bush. Therefore, baking soda (Option A), sunlight (Option B), seeds (Option C), and planting time (Option D) are all ineffective.\n4. The only remaining answer that could be relevant to growing greenery is \"warm weather\" (Option E).

{"text": "had found a good home for some plants, she kept killing them off. Choices:  A. bad luck B. green fingers C. bad garden D. not green-footed enough E. too much sun F. not watering\nRationales: This one may have caught you a little off guard. This passage does not imply anything bad about her luck. It's her gardening skills that are poor. So how is green-footed one of the incorrect answers? I remember a video from TED called \"Your green thumb, explained\" by Ameya Kamat. It's about how we all naturally have a green thumb, even if you kill every plant you touch with extreme care. The point is how the plants die in your hands is not your fault. They have different needs, and they respond differently to changes around them. So, if all plants died in your hands, you really don't have bad luck, you simply have green fingers. Just like any plant, there's a chance your plant will survive or not. This is why we don't blame people for the death if their plants - it's not them, it's the plant. If we have this perspective, it's easier to avoid frustration and disappointment when gardening. So, why not choose \"green-footed\". I believe this is the common interpretation of what a green thumb is. Let us look at the other options now. A \"bad luck\" is common when gardening, and it's not relevant. Choice C, \"bad garden\" isn't relevant either. Choice D, \"not green-footed enough,\" is possible, but it doesn't follow.

The person that has a \"green thumb\" is someone who can grow plants in good condition by maintaining their water level and nutrients properly. 9. Flower - a flower is the show case of a plant of which is a type of bloom. 10. Chooses: A: green thumb. It is the one word that all the phrases are pointing at. It is a figure of speech that describes someone with the ability to grow plants in good condition through the watering and nourishing. 11. The phrase: She sure didn' t have a green thumb B: \"wasn' t\" which is a simple grammar error. \"Didn't\" is used with the word \"was\". 12. The phrase : She sure didn't a green thumb C: \"she\" is an \"It\" word. In English, to use 3rd person you need to use pronoun \"It\". Example: She killed the plant. 13. D: \"good\" is a descriptive word. No one called people that are good all their life,", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "was helping out with plant food, the flowers just slowly shriveled. Choices:  A. didn't know what she was really doing B. didn't do it often enough C. too much D. too little  E. tried to do something good E. didn't understand how to help\nRationales: This is a grammar question, using the given sentences to identify the correct parts of speech for the italicized portion. We start by considering each option:\n1. Option A. \"had\": this is a past participle, which means the part of the sentence was a verb's past form\n2. Option B. \"what\": this is an objective pronoun, used as an object or complement to a verb or preposition \n3. Option C. \"it\": this is a pronoun, as an object or complement that replaces a noun or pronoun\n4. Option D. \"doing\": this is a verb in its infinitive phrase, meaning it cannot be the antecedent of a past participle\n5. Option E. \"didn't\": this is the past tense of \"to do,\" a conjugated verb, and so cannot be the past participle\n6. Based on the sentence's structure and content, none of the options match our current knowledge of the subject's actions, making them all incorrect answers. Therefore, we can conclude that the part of speech the subject is using is the past participle, which is used after \"had\" in the sentence.\nAnswer: A. Didn't know what she did.\n\nInput: If you were to compare a dog and a cat, you are comparing which of the following? Choices:  Animal that moves faster  Pet that eats fish  Cleaner of household  Cuddled mature cat A. Cat B. C. Dog D. Fur balls\nRationales: Starting with each answer individually:\n1. Pet that eats fish: the cat is not a fish-eater. It has no connection to the rest of the answers, so this is a logical false response.\n2. Cleaner of household: the cat is not always cuddled and is not always a mature cat. It doesn't fully match, and the fur ball only describes the dog's hair, not a single characteristic of the animal, so that isn't the correct answer either", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "had a real connection with plants, the leaves always fall off. Choices:  A. plants die B. plant fail C. plant thrives D. plants become dead E. plants deteriorate F. plants rot\nRationales: First, let's consider the context of the story. The phrase \"She sure didn't have green thumb\" is an ironic way of saying that someone doesn't succeed with growing/keeping plants while using \"green thumb\" as a metaphor for success in plant care.\n2. Then, let's examine the possible options (A through F). Since we're looking for the opposite of successfully plant care, we'll eliminate options that are positive.\n3. In A (plants die) and D (plants deteriorate), plant death is a given; these options do not indicate whether someone did or did not have success as they are describing what happens once plants have died.\n4. In option B (plant fail), we can see that it's possible for somebody who has been successful with plants in the past to fail at plant care at this moment. If the phrase \"She sure didn\u2019t have a green thumb\" is meant to be an ironic, sarcastic comment then this option makes sense as a possible response.\n5. Option E can also be a likely answer because it describes an expected outcome of not caring for your plant well.\n6. Option F is incorrect because \"plants rotting away\" does not suggest anything about how successful somebody was with plant care.\n7. So, between A and B, the most likely options for what plants do when she takes care of them are either they die or they fail. To find the \"opposite\" of having a green thumb, we would need to decide which of the two best fits the meaning of having a \"green thumb.\" The way the sentence is written, \"successfully taking care of plants\" can sound synonymous with, \"knowing how to grow plants well,\" suggesting \"A: plants die\" is the most likely option.\n8. Therefore if it does, \"plants die\" would be the correct answer to the question.\nAnswer: A : Plants die.\n\n### Solution\nA shelf is a suitable place to store a clock because it provides a flat surface that can be fitted with clock mounts to keep a clock secure and easily accessible.\nA", "answer": " 131"}

First, we'll eliminate the answers that don't fit:\n4. The color white has no place in the question, and \"green thumb\" already implies a certain color. D: red and E: white would be false answers. \n5. \"Black thumb\" implies having poor agricultural skills, while green thumb means success in growing plants. C: yellow and F: green are incorrect answers. \n6. Choices D and E are still likely answers because the question uses metaphor, but the best answer choice from what was left would be D: red because it would match the metaphor.\n7. Consequently, the answer would be D: red.\nAnswer: D - red.\n\nInput: What do people get when they travel far? Choices:  D: jet lag F: new clothes E: sunburn H: dirty shoes \nRationales: Given the context of travelling, jet lag, sunburn, and dirty shoes are all plausible answers, but all of them have something to do with physical consequences of travel, except jet lag.\nJet lag is a mental phenomena, with psychological and behavioral issues following travel.\nHowever, E, sunburn, and H, dirty shoes, both have consequences that one might experience after travel.\nSunburn is skin damage that can happen from prolonged exposure to the sun, which can be linked to travelling.\nSimilarly, dirty shoes are something that travelers may experience when they walk to new places, so this can also be a good answer.\nF, new clothes can be interpreted in different ways, but it also makes physical sense, since travelling provides people with the opportunity to see different places, and dress/buy new clothes is a side effect of that.\nSince all the answer choices are physically plausible, to eliminate the options that have nothing to do with physical phenomena, we need to look at their meanings.\nSo, in this question, the best answer is F, because a new dress is not what one gets when they travel.\nAnswer: F - New clothes\n\nInput:  When they", "answer": " 27"}
{"text": "was growing vegetables, it was growing weed. Choices: A: She used wrong watering technique B: Weeds don't need the same amount of sunlight C: Weeds don'thave to be in soil D: Purchased a garden kit E: Watering can\nRationales: The first step is to consider the key parts in the prompt: \"She sure didn't have... vegetables\"\nThe context is that the person didn't do a good job growing vegetables. \"She was growing weed\" implies they were growing the weed intentionally as a garden and not by accident. In order to grow vegetables, one needs to \"water\" them regularly and not overwater them.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible option is choice C: watering technique.\n\nThe other option is weeding.\n\nWatering is necessary in order to grow plants, but the same is not true for weeds, so choice B is incorrect\n\nLikewise, the weed itself is in the soil, which doesn't suggest the watering can, choice E, is the most plausible answer. Likewise, the word purchase may suggest choice D and not choice E.\n\nAnswer: C: She used the wrong watering technique\n\n### Instructions:  In the field, it is very important to use the right kind of light for a task.

A lightning storm is an electrostatic discharge that can start a fire. Choice C implies a firefly, but it can't be a correct option. Choice B is the best answer. \n\nIn the second context, when it comes to changing light switches, choice A is correct. It's a handheld torc and it's the best answer.

Choices:  A. didn't enjoy the hobby  B.  didn't work in the field  C. didn't know who was  D. didn't understand the subject E. didn't stay with the plan\nRationales:1. The context is talking about a green thumb, which generally refers to a person with a skill for gardening. \n2. Each option has been modified to include the word \"green\" and fits the context of the question. \n3. Starting with option A: didn't enjoy the [green thumb] hobby, this is referring to a person who isn't interested in gardening or has no skills related to it, which would make the person unable to have a green thumb. \n4. Option B would need more qualification than simply saying \"didn't work in the [green thumb] field\". For example, the qualification could be \"didn't enjoy working in the [green thumb]. \n5. Option D: didn't understand the [green thumb] subject. This makes sense because having a green thumb implies a certain level of expertise in the field, so one would need knowledge or understanding of the subject to have the skill.\n6. Option C is not an accurate choice as \"who was\" is used in reference to a particular person who was unknown and not the concept of an individual with a green thumb. 7. Option E: she didn't stay with The [green thumb] Plan, is the correct answer. This implies that the person was attempting to have a green thumb but for some reason abandoned the plan.\n8.

{"text": "had a pot. Choices:  A. planted something. B. kept it, C. watered, D. grew vegetables, E. potted\nRationales: This question tests a common phrase \"she sure didn't have ___\" followed by a noun that describes a talent or ability. The question here asks us to interpret which ability or talent does the person in the statement have or don't have, and identify the corresponding noun.\n1. The first step of this task is to understand the question thoroughly. The question explicitly mentions a \"green thumb\". Based on the context, it represents the ability to be good at growing plants or having a green thumb, which is the noun we're looking for. \n2. The next thing to do is interpret the options. We need to find a noun in the options that's related to green thumb, which is watered, planted something, grew vegetables, potted, and kept it.\n3. Now, based on the given information and the options, we can see that 'watered' is not related to a noun meaning green thumb, since it's not about growing or caring for plants. Therefore, we can cross it off our list.\n4. 'Planted something' can refer to planting a plant, which makes it possible that this is a green thumb ability. However, the next noun, kept, doesn't have anything to do with green thumb, so this is also not the correct answer. \n5. 'Grew vegetables' is an option that's related to growing plants and could be considered a green thumb noun, but it can also imply a separate skill or talent, so we can't be sure which one the sentence is referring to.\n6. 'Potted', which is the ability to grow plants in pots or containers, is a good green thumb noun. This is the least likely answer option if the person in the sentence does not have a green thumb, but it's possible, and it has the advantage of being a grammatically correct word, so it could also be the correct one. \n7. We can eliminate 'grew vegetables' and 'kept it' as they're unrelated to green thumb. \n8.

The woman was attempting to grow plants and flowers in her garden. She did not have a green thumb because she failed to do so.\n1. The first choice is A: a flower, but a flower is not necessarily a part of a green thumb. This option can be eliminated.\n2. The second choice is B: a plant. A plant is a possible part of a green thumb, so it can be retained as a potential option.\n3. The third choice is C: a vegetable, which is not necessarily a part or attribute of a green thumb. While plants and vegetables are often interchanged, they are not the same.\n4. The fourth choice is D: a lawn, which is not typically associated with a green thumb. Lawns have different goals and qualities to gardens, so this option can be eliminated as it does not align with the goal of growing plants.\n5. The final choice is E: the yard. While parts or attributes of a green thumb may be found in a yard, it's not typically associated with the goal of growing a garden and plants. Therefore, this option is also not applicable as an answer.\n6. Comparing the remaining options, we can eliminate several as incorrect since \"Every time she thought she was\" indicates she tried multiple times, and the statement is made after her failures.

Choice A is a short phrase that refers to someone's hands. We know that the question is about a \"green thumb\", not green hands. Choice B does not make sense at all based on the context, as it is unlikely that a person knows what flowers do when you give them a little water. Choice C and D do not make any sense, as neither a plant nor a dead flower can last for one hour. The only possible reasonable answer we're looking for is the second answer in the list, that is, A: plant. This is a plant that could be dead for one hour and still be considered a plant. The choice also makes sense, as the phrase \"the plant she tried to grow \" suggests that this was one among many plants that she's failed to grow. Finally, the last line of the sentence \"would be dead flowers for one hour\" refers to dead flowers that were once living flowers. This fits with a plant dying and being considered dead after one hour, making this the best choice. So, the answer is: Choice C: A plant.  \n\nInput: What did the customer want after he walked in?

Therefore, it's important to consider the person's intention.  In this case, it is not to buy something in particular, so the best answer is B: the best deal.

This seems to imply that she had a lack of awareness, attentiveness, or understanding of what was happening. These are the characteristics of a green thumb.\nTherefore, options C, E, and D are incorrect because they don't include the idea of her lack of understanding or attentiveness.\nOption B is incorrect due to its use of the word \"just\" which makes her misunderstanding or inattentiveness seem like a minor detail when it was actually a large part of her issue.\nOption A (\"She has bad luck\") is also incorrect, because it doesn't account for the phrase \"every time she thinks she has...\".

{"text": "was a success she tried and failed again. Choices:  A. green thumb B. black thumb C. white thumb D. broken thumb E. blue thumb\nRationales: We're asked to determine why a person may have failed time and again.\n1. What does the phrase \"She sure didn't have...\" mean? It could be viewed as two statements or statements in isolation:\na. \"She sure didn'th ave a thumb\"\nb. \"a green thumb\"\n2. Green thumb, black thumb, and white thumb are all synonyms for having above or below average ability with regard to gardening or horticulture.\n3. Broken thumb refers to an injury to the thumb, while blue thumb is a synonym for having a different color to one's thumbs. \n4. Combining the second part with the previous statements:\n5. \"had a green thumb\"\n6. \"She sure didnth ave...a black thumb\"\n7. \"she had a white thumb\"\n8. \"she had a broken thumb\"\n9. \"she had a blue thumb\"\n10. These statements don't make sense in context (1 - 2).

A. was hungry 2. B. had been hungry 3. C. was going to be hungry 4. D. was eating 5. E. was about to eat\nCORRECT RATIONALE: The first part of the sentence makes it obvious that someone was hungry. From the time-sequence implied in the phrase, \"she never found time to work out\", it is inferred that she was hungry at the time, so option C is the correct choice.\nAnswer: C. was hungry\n\nInput: He is a professional dancer, what does he mostly do when not working?

{"text": "had planted what? Choices: . A: plant A: tree B: shrub C: ficus C: cactus D: rose E: flower\nRationales: It can be inferred that in choosing each of the answer choices, one must be careful to consider both the literal meaning of the word \"plant\" and any potential metaphorical meanings of the terms and the answer choices.\n1. A: plant: This is the answer choice that is closest in meaning to the meaning of the word \"green\".\n2. A: tree: This is the answer that contains the \"green\" in the word.\n3. A: shrub: This has been used as a literary or symbolic phrase, however it has nothing to do with the color green.\n4. A: ficus: This is an appropriate answer choice because the word is often used to refer to a plant.\n5. A: cactus: This is a plant that is well known for its large size and shape, particularly when referring to the plant as an ornamental feature.\n6. A: rose: This refers to a flower that is typically purple, and is known for its intense scent.\n7. B: sheer: This refers to the amount of light that can be filtered through a porous material.\n8. These answer choices were all incorrect or inappropriate for the meaning of \"green\", which is why none of them were chosen to be correct.\n9.

{"text": "was helping plants, they ended up dying. Choices:  A what could've happened to them? B: she used to have a green thumb C: green thumb isn't necessary D: she got better at gardening E: green thumbs were no longer necessary\nRationales: First, understand the question and the context, noting that the question is not specifically about gardening but focuses on plants dying in her care. \n1. The phrase \"every time she thought she was\" indicates that she was attempting to help the plants but ultimately failed or was unable to. \n2. We can then eliminate choice D: she got better as it contradicts the notion of not being able to help the plants. \n3. Choice B: she used to is not a correct answer since she could be referring to someone else in the past who did have a \"green thumb\" and not her.\n4. Choice A: what could've happened can't be accurately determined from the given information, and the remaining choices provide more specific answers. \n5. Choice C: green thumb can't be the answer since the phrase \"green thumb isn't necessary\" clearly implies that it is no longer required or not necessarily present.\n6. Choice E: green thumbs weren't necessary makes the most sense since the phrase \"were no longer necessary\" refers to the state of the plants, which weren't able to be helped by her in the past.\n7.

Choices that would not serve as a replacement for a wallet or payment method such as a food item (\"f\") are eliminated.\n2. The following choices are then analyzed based on their suitability as substitutes. Choice (f) bag can be eliminated as it requires buying a \"bag\" to carry the money. \n3", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "finally grew something healthy, there was always something that went wrong; which of these is least likely to lead to failure? Choices: 1. A: bad soil 2. B: excess sunlight C. D: bad fertilizer D. E: none of the above\nRationales: First, understanding the question: this indicates that we're attempting to answer a question with answers 1 through 5. We should determine which option is most likely least to be the cause of failure while considering the options. \n\n1. She didn't have a good green thumb. A bad result, but not the least likely failure. Next up is her fertilizer. Let's take a look: \n2. The choice is between different elements of fertilizer, but this question is specifically about the \"soil\". The first element to be mentioned in the list of problems is \"bad soil\", but even if the other elements of fertilizer are \"bad\", they likely would not cause issues if applied to good soil. This indicates that A is the answer.\n3. Now considering the other options: the next item listed is \"excess sunlight\". It is probably true that excess sunlight might be bad for plants, but a lack of sunlight could cause greater harm. It is also uncommon, and doesn't mention specific actions, like the element mentioned in answer 1 that failed. It doesn't match what we know about the situation. \n4. Next up is \"bad fertilizer\". Is it bad? Well, if it's \"bad\", it may cause problems. However, if it's too \"good\", it may cause problems (over fertilization can actually be harmful to plants). In addition to the question being about the \"soil\" it also involves problems with her \"growing\" it. It seems likely that she over fertilized. So, E is not the correct answer because it doesn't really mention soil or plants. \n5. The last is \"none of the above\". To be considered the \"least likely\", it clearly mentions something more likely than the \"none of the above\" answer. \n6. So, the correct answer is A: bad soil.\nAnswer: A - bad soil", "answer": " 480"}
{"text": "was trying, she was actually watering her plants too much. Choices:  A. Plants are dying  B. It's not her fault  C. She's watering plants too much  D. She was trying\nRationales: First, understand the question and all the available options:\nA: Plants are dying is not applicable to our scenario, as it's not saying any of her plants are dying due to her watering them. It only mentions plants that haven't been watered enough.\nB: It's not her Fault, this is a statement about the plants, not what she is trying to do.\nC: 'She's watering plants, too much' does not make sense as the phrase'she was trying' suggests she's trying to avoid watering her plants 'too much', which would suggest the opposite of this conclusion.\nD: The phrase \"she was trying\" gives us the hint, and \"she was actually\" indicates that \"trying\" did not lead to the desired outcome.\nTherefore, A: she's watering plants 'too much' is the only option that fits the question.\nAnswer: A. She's water plants too much.\n\nInput: If she wants to get an oil change, she should take her car to a mechanic. Choices:  B. Take her car to the dentist  C. Take her car to an oil change place  D. Just buy more oil\nRationales: What should we do to take her car to an oil place:\nB: Take her car to the mechanic is redundant, as they are the ones who do the oil changes.\nC: Take her to an oil place is not applicable. It doesn't make sense that if she takes her car to an oilplace she will do an oil change on it. As the question asks to take her car to get an oil change.\nD: Just buy more oil is irrelevant. It does not make sense that if she wants to get an engine oil change she should just buy more oil and change it herself (while she could do that with other types of oil), as this doesn't lead to the specified outcome.\nTherefore A: Take her car to a mechanics is the correct answer.", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "was planting flower, she was actually planting what? Choices:  B: tomato plant C: tree D: cactus E: tree sapling\nRationales: This example requires two steps: first, interpreting the question; then considering the correct answer: 1. We need to understand the question. It's asking what the woman was actually planting. \n2. We need to know what the woman's intentions were in order to determine what she planted. \n3. Step 1: Interpreting the question.  We look at each option: we know that the woman didn't have a \"green thumb,\" which implies that her abilities or results with gardening were not ideal.\n4. Option A: Flower plant. The woman did not plant flowers, so this does not fit the context of the question.\n5. Option B: Tomato plant. The phrase \"plant any tomato\" could be a phrase saying she \"grew\" a tomato, making this an option. However, it does not fit with the specificity of the phrasing. \n6. Option C: Tree. Another option that fits the specificity of the question.\n7. Option D: Cactus. This does not fit with the phrasing.\n8. Option E: Tree Sapling. This is another option that makes sense in the context of the question; when the woman planted the tree sapling, she planted a tree.\n9. We should also check the other options and eliminate ones that don't fit with the overall meaning of the sentence. Once the potential answer is determined, it can be reviewed. \n10. From this review, it can be confirmed that the correct answer is C; she planted a tree, not her intended flower plants.\n11. The reason for the woman's disastrous results with plants could be because she was not able to distinguish between a tomato plant and a tree, which is possible due to her lack of \"green thumb,\" showing that she likely did not have proper training or knowledge about the plants she was trying to grow.\n12. Therefore, the answer to the riddle is C: tree.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: If someone gets lost in the woods, how long does he likely have before he needs to seek help?

{"text": "was helping someone she usually ended up in a very bad situation, what did she really give? Choices: \nA: a present B: a prize C: an eatable D: a gift E: a handicap\nRationales: The question asks us to determine what someone gave in a specific situation. To do so, we first have to comprehend the context of the sentence: A woman is helping someone with a project that involves gardening and growing some plants. \nA: Prize- the prize could be something given to the gardener, but as we can infer that this is not an appropriate prize from the tone of the writing, we can eliminate A as a possible answer. \nB: Present is out of the question, given that the purpose of the gift is not to make someone happy, but rather to help them.\nC: Eatable - could be an appropriate gift if the purpose is to nourish and fuel the gardener, but again, we can surmise that the gift is not about this from the context.\nD: Gift - though the purpose may not be focused on happiness, the gift could still be a token of appreciation or a way of showing someone you care about them. \nE: Handicap - could be an appropriate answer, but we can surmise from the context of the writing that this is not meant as a gift in the usual sense, but rather as a means of helping someone.   \nTherefore, the best answer is D: gift, as it encompasses all the relevant elements from the context of the sentence.\nAnswer: D : gift \n\nInput: What does the question mean?

The question refers to the person's lack of success in growing plants. \n2. Next, determine the choice which doesn\u2019t make sense. The only choice which seems to make sense here, is the last one, as the question refers to the person thinking they wanted the plant only to fail.\n3. Check the first two choices one by one: Plant (1): A person can plant a flower, it doesn't mean a person can make one 4. Check the rest: roses (5) - A person can buy a rose, but is it a mistake that they tried to make a rose? sculpture (6) - This would require specific tools, which is not a suitable option 5. Check the last three options: furniture (8) - A person can purchase furniture, but not a mistake to make furniture 6. Last choice; pottery (2) - This would require pottery-making tools, which is not what the question is asking for. Check the first two again for inconsistency.\n7. The only option which fits the question is pottery (2), which makes a person likely to make an error while growing plants.\nAnswer: 2: pottry\n\nInput: Who does not like the show, the one that made who famous?

Choice A: potato is not correct because the question does not mention the specific plant. It only mentions that a green thumb is not present, which means she has tried multiple alternatives (potatoes being one of them).\n4. Choice B: tomato is not correct because they have no evidence of this being planted or grown, therefore, it is highly unlikely.\n5. Choice C: lettuce is incorrect because even though lettuce is a vegetable, it is not always grown or planted outside. They might have indoor lettuces.\n6. Choice E: chili peppers are not correct because the question asks about vegetables, and chili peppers, by definition, are not considered a vegetable.\n7.

{"text": "did her plants would die? Choices:  Choices: A: garden B: flowers C: pets D: friends E: plants\nRationales:\n1. The first key to solving this question is understanding the literal meaning of the phrase \"had a green thumb.\" This phrase refers to possessing a natural ability to keep plants healthy and thriving. So, someone can have a green thumb, or not have one, depending on their natural aptitude.\n2. We interpret the possible answer choices to determine which ones are likely to be relevant or appropriate. \n3. Options A: garden; this implies we're looking for an area or space where plants would be planted or grown.\n4. Option C: pets; although animals can be kept and cared for, the phrase \"green thumb\" does not refer to this aspect of plant care.\n5. Option D: friends; this refers to relationships, not plants, so this option is eliminated.\n6. Option E: plants; this is not an aspect of green thumb care, and we already eliminated this option in determining the literal meaning of \"green thumb.\"\n7. We are left with two options: A: garden and B: flowers. Both of these can be areas where plants are maintained and nurtured, so both options are relevant, but if one were to have a green thumb, they would have no trouble maintaining the plants. Thus, option B: flowers with their tendency to die more frequently, would make less sense.\n8.

Choices: A: plant food B: plant pot C: plant taller D: plant flower E: plant water\nRationales: The question is asking about the common phrase \"green thumb,\" where the phrase \"green thumb\" literally describes a person's thumb being green, but more commonly implies that the person is skilled at cultivating living plants and flowers. Since the options aren't related to the literal meaning of the phrase, we need to focus on its figurative meaning. \nA literal definition would be: \"a green thumb is a useful thumb.\" As the options indicate, this statement does not make sense. For example, choice A: \u201cplant food\u201d does not require a green thumb to make plants grow, so it is not relevant to the meaning of the phrase. Similarly, choices B: \u201cplant pot\u201d and C: \u201cplant taller\u201d do not require a specific color of thumb to be effective, so they are not relevant. Choices D: \u201cplant flower\u201d and E: \u201cplant water\u201d are closely related to the meaning of green thumb, which implies nurturing and care, and are therefore more applicable, making them possible answers.\nFollowing the rationale stated above, the best answer choice is E: \"plant water\".\nAnswer: E: plant water\n\nInput: You got the information she was looking for, what is it that she needed in order to solve her problem?

Plants don't spontaneously explode or combust.\n4. Choice B: shrivel. The plants shrive when they don't have enough water to grow.\n5. Choice C: sprout. To sprout is to develop or grow new buds or shoots that haven't existed before. This could be relevant to this context.\n6. Choice A: grow well.

This choice is more likely to be the correct answer.\n\"Purple\" would be a color that can be linked with the term \"green thumb\" because it is a color that can be found in plants or flowers.\n\nAnswer: D. purple\n\n### Instructions:\n\n\n\n\nI have done 5 questions above, is it possible for me to write 5 more questions for the test?", "answer": " 41"}
{"text": "was going to succeed at gardening, she gave it up. Choices:  A green thumb B: red thumb C) can't thumb D) blue thumb E) brown thumb\nRationales: The correct answer to this question must represent someone who failed to succeed at gardening.\nThe first step is to consider each option independently: \n* A green thumb: this phrase refers to a person who has a natural talent or ability for gardening. Using green thumb in this context would effectively mean \"successful at gardening\". The sentence ends with her giving gardening up, suggesting that the answer will not be green thumb, as this would mean she was giving up gardening because she found it to be easy and successful. \n* A red thumb: A red thumb is a phrase referring to someone who's incompetent at using a computer keyboard. It doesn't really fit with this context because gardening and computer use are too different, so it's excluded. \n\n* She couldn't do it: this makes it very likely that someone will give something up, as the phrase itself suggests the impossibility to do something. However, in this context, it can't be gardening, as the last sentence implies that she was trying, so we can eliminate \"couldn't do it\".\n* A brown thumb: this is an acceptable alternative since in this context, it refers to someone who isn't good with doing gardening. However, considering the end sentence, it could also suggest a poor gardening strategy or decision, so it's omitted from consideration.\n* Blue thumb: this phrase is typically associated with being able to detect color blindness. However, it makes little sense to use it in gardening, so this choice is also rejected.\n* Black thumb: a black thumb typically refers to someone who is unable to grow plants or flowers. However, this answer also doesn't really make sense, because at the end of the sentence, she was trying, which makes no sense if she never was able to grow plants. So, it's rejected.\n* Someone who failed: although this answer makes sense from the beginning it isn't the only answer to a question like this. \n* You could have a green thumb: although this is the exact opposite of the answer our interruption must represent, this doesn't mean that we disqualify it from consideration.\n* You can't", "answer": " 400"}
{"text": "was on top everything changed. Choices:  A. rainbow B: wind C::dry weather D: dry air E: water E: sunshine\nRationales: At this point, you should be pretty good at determining which choice fits the task and which one doesn't. \n1. The first thing to do is to identify the object being referred to. The only choice that makes sense is \"rainbow.\" In the sentence, she is trying to grow flowers or fruit, which are green. Therefore, \"rainbow\" is the correct answer. However, it is unlikely that something she would do has a rainbow shape, so this choice is removed from consideration. \n2. The second thing to do is to determine which choice fits the question. Looking at the options available, B and C seem to follow the pattern of a sequence of events: \"every time she..\" and \"everything changed.\" \n3. The next thing to do is to eliminate a choice that has been identified. Since \"green thumb\" is related to vegetation, which is green, \"rainbow\" cannot be the correct choice. Therefore, the correct choice is \"wind.\"\n4. Repeat the process for the remaining options. For the choice we just eliminated, if rainbow is removed, it would be obvious that wind would be chosen. So, the correct answer is \"wind.\"\nAnswer: A: rainbow B: wind\n\nInput: There was a loud noise, where could it come from if in the sky? Choices:  a: airplane  b: siren c: volcano  d: earthquake e; thunder\nRationales: First, consider the question. The sentence mentions a \"loud noise.\" This is a term that is typically associated with a noise such as a siren or a thunderstorm. \nNext, consider the possible answer choices: \na: airplane. An airplane can make a loud noise, but the question does not mention any specific type of aircraft. It's best to exclude this choice. \nb: siren. Sirens are commonly associated with emergencies, including weather-related events like the kind described in the sentence. Therefore, this choice is relevant and should be considered. \nc: volcano. Volcanos can erupt, which involves a loud noise, and it's possible that the source of the noise could", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "planted something that would surely grow, the thing ended up dying. Choices:  A) green B) dead  C) blue D) red E) golden\nRationales: Question: If her plant always died, what did she lack?\n1. Answer will not depend on a literal meaning of \u201cgreen thumb\u201d, which means good luck in gardening.\n2. She did not have a green thumb, because every time she tried to plant something she thought would be growing, it would always die.\n3. Therefore, \u201cgreen thumb\u201d is out of the question.\n4. We look at the remaining clues: (blue=sad, red=angry, dead=died-she did not have a green-living thumb)\n5. The answer choice for this riddle is option C) blue thumb-she lacked having the ability to succeed in gardening because she felt sad every time she tried to do something.\n6. We understand that she did not have the ability to garden successfully because every time she thought she could, it ended up dying. This is why she had to keep planting the next thing-she was desperate to find something that would grow.\n7. Since there is no answer choice of \"red thumb\", because \"red\" does not mean one has a \"bad (red) thumb\".\n8. In addition, \"blue\" does not make sense because it would not make you sad all the time, but maybe just disappointed.\n9. Finally, since \"golden\" is not commonly associated with gardening, it makes more sense to conclude that the woman did not have a \"green thumb\". Therefore, the answer is \"she did not have a 'green thumb'\"; it does not matter what color the thumb is because it would not have worked regardless of the color.\nAnswer: C) blue thumb\n\nInput: The question is \"what is the point in life?\". The answer is A: nothing is certain.\nRationales:\n\n1. First, we need to take a closer look at the question. It asks, \"What is the point in life?\" When we consider the phrase \"point in life\", we can see that it's used to refer to a person's goals, aspirations, or purpose in life. \n2.

Consider the various answer choices, it looks like the answer involves planting garden herbs in the greenhouse, \n2. Which means options A: grow and B: harvest both involve cultivating plants and are plausible answers. \n3. Let's consider the next option as a possibility, which is C: save, and we realise that this choice would not be suitable as it does not indicate any activity that relates to gardening in the greenhouse. \n4. Moving on to option D: sell, we know that it is something people do with garden plants but what about greenhouse? No greenhouse is needed for selling vegetables.\n5. Lastly, we are left with choice E: put which describes putting plants in the greenhouse which is the only choice that relates to everything in the question, therefore, we can conclude that the final answer is E: put. \nAnswer: E: put", "answer": " 106000"}
{"text": "planted seeds. Choices:  A. it never worked B. didn't produce C. it's okay D. didn't die e. didn't grow\nRationales: First, understand the phrase \"didn't have a green.\" This suggests that someone's previous experiences or attempts were unsuccessful. \n1. Option A: This is a good guess for the meaning of the phrase \"every time she thought she plant\" - meaning that each time she planted seeds, she was met with failure. Therefore, we can eliminate this option as the phrase is not as accurate. \n2. Option B: This option incorrectly assumes that planting seeds refers to gardening and not other plant-related activities. Choice C: This is a reasonable option as it matches the intention and tone of the question.\n\nAnswer: C. It's okay.\n\nInput: Who will be happy if it rains during their week in the summer? Choices:  a. parents b. students c. teachers d. coaches e. guests\nRationales:1. First, determine the specific purpose or result of getting wet during the week. It will likely be related to an activity, and the options are teachers, coaches, guests, students, and parents.2. Next, read all of the answers carefully and consider the likely outcome of being wet during the week.3. It's likely that at least one of these people would be happy because they are getting wet.4. There is a possibility that all of them are happy.5. The option to choose is C: \"students\". They are the only ones who can be guaranteed to enjoy getting wet and having a fun time.6.

E: wrong A. the plant died and turned red, B. nothing happens, just the plant dies and turns red, C. the plant is yellow or orange, D. the plant is green, E. the plant does what it should\nRationales:\nA - The plant can be any color, the sentence is saying that every time, despite her \"knowing what to do\", the plant still dies and turns red.\nB - The sentence is saying that every plant dies and turns red. There is nothing specific about the \"plant\" in this option, so the sentence can't be referring to \"nothing happens, just the plant,\" because nothing is happening to the plant, not the thing that gets killed due to her lack of a green thumb.\nC - The sentence is saying the plant dies and turns RED. \"The plant is yellow or orange\" can't be correct, because we know the plant is dying and turning red.\nD - The sentence is saying \"The plant is green!\" So clearly referring to a green plant that lives and is green as opposed to a plant that dies.\nE - There is no such thing as \"The plant does what it should\".\nAnswer: D: the plant is green\n\nInput: Your brother was arrested he didn't realize that someone else what?

They think he's involved with the person they were looking for, not the other person. To explain why, we go through each choice:\n5: was watching them\nThe person they were looking for would have been watching him, but he wasn't guilty of whatever the crime was. The police can't think he's involved when the crime was committed, he has to be involved in the crime they're currently looking for.\n6: was following them\nThe sentence says, \"police were looking", "answer": " 24"}

Green, a color, is not a thumb and therefore does not fit with the answer. \nSimilarly, dirt does not refer to a thumb and does not fit with the solution either. \nC. flowers. Flowers are the color green, but they refer to a plant, not a thumb. \nD. weeds. Weeds are a plant and thus do not represent a green thumb.  E. herbs. Herbs refer to a plant that includes a green color but is not referred to as a thumb, so this is not a suitable answer. \n\nThe correct answer is B. Flowers.

Choices: 1: she didn\u2019t eat enough 2: she didn\u2019t have enough sunlight 3: she was forgetful 4: she had mice 5: she didn't have a spade\nRationales: The problem needs to be clearly understood. The question is, \"why?\" What went wrong with the green thumb. \n1. Understand the possible answer choices. Each one of them has a different meaning of \"why\" and should be interpreted according to that meaning. That is \"she didn't eat enough,\" \"she didn't have enough sunlight\", she was forgetful\" and \"she had mice.\n2. The first thing to check is when a specific person or thing would be forgetful or have enough sunlight. It is a common sense that a plant can't take care of sunlight and eat food. One can't expect a plant to be forgetful. The only choice that fits is she had mice but then the question will only be \"she didn't wash them away\". The only answer from these answers that she is \"forgetting to wash mice\".\n3. She might have had the tools to wash the mice by giving enough sunlight and eating food but she is forgetting to use them. This implies that it should come to the point where he will have to use all of those things to get out of the problem.\nInput: What does your brother want to drink?

We start by ruling out any options that obviously cannot be applied. Choices that clearly do not fit the question or do not represent the correct answer are A: perfume, B: perfume, C: soda, D: alcohol, and E: spices.\n3. The answer must apply to someone who has the opposite of a green thumb.\n4. Someone who has a green thumb is commonly thought to be someone who has a natural aptitude for gardening and is capable of growing healthy and flourishing plants. \n5.

Read the explanation to identify the best answer.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the whole sentence:\nThe sentence describes an unsuccessful gardener whose constant mistake is to try to plant more of the same species of flowers instead of changing the species to match the climate or soil composition where she is planting her plants. \nStep 2. Eliminate the obviously wrong answers:\nA: What is wrong with her?\nThis question does not ask about a wrong action, but a wrong feeling. This response is irrelevant.\n\nB: She is not an owner of a farm.\nThis response is irrelevant, as the sentence does not describe a farm but a garden.\n\nC: She doesn\u2019t know what to do with the crop.\nThis response also does not match the intention of the sentence. It describes an act that may have occurred, not a wrong action.\n\nD: She would never give up.\nThis response is incorrect because the sentence ends with she planted the right kinds of seeds. The sentence does not imply a wrong action. \n\nE: She planted the right kind.\nThe right kind is the answer to the question.

The word \u201cshe\u201d in the sentence is non-specific, so the answer choice needs to be one that is common to both men and women.\n2. \"Patience\" is a personality trait that can be helpful for any number of tasks, including gardening, but it is not universal to all humans, as many people may not need it. This eliminates answer option (a). \n3. \"More information\" is a possible answer choice that can be helpful in improving one's knowledge or skill in any field, but \"more\" refers to the amount of information, not necessarily its quality. For gardening, \"more information\" may help, but it is not as useful an answer choice as (b). \n4. \"Better soil\" could indicate that the person lacked understanding of gardening due to a lack of relevant knowledge, skills, and/or information. \"Better soil\", however, does not necessarily make it easier to grow plants. This eliminates (c).\n5. \"Less water\" can be interpreted as too much or too little of a substance used to grow plants. Over-watering or under-watering plants can also cause them to die, so \"less water\" is not the most suitable of the choices. This eliminates (d).\n6. \"New Plants\" can be interpreted as having an already flourishing garden but being inexperienced in growing new plants. However, the answer choices are intended to help an individual who isn't confident in their current gardening skills, not just provide them with new plants for their existing garden.

Pull away to weeds: this suggests the person was doing something related to removing weeds from a garden or other planted area, implying they were actually making the situation worse.\n2. Gave up gardening: this doesn't make sense as it could indicate a person who suddenly stopped gardening, which doesn't align with the statement \"every time.\"\n3. Tried to eat the vegetable: this could be a possible answer as it could mean the person was being disrespectful and attempting to consume food without permission or respect.\n4. Dried herbs: this doesn't seem likely as it might imply the person was involved in a garden related activity, but would not have an impact.\n5. Bought dirt: this could be an option, however, it doesn't fit the sentence as it's not an action the person took themselves. \n6. Watered plants: this is a plausible answer, as it could mean the individual was misusing resources or treating the plants in an improper manner.

And because \"thumb\" is used in the question, we understand that each of the answer choices indicates a color.\n1.

The context implies that someone is looking for a specific jacket in their house.\n1. The person is looking for a jacket specifically and might need to ask about its color. So option B: What color is the jacket? is an appropriate option.\n2. The person is looking at the house and might need some information to guide them towards the jacket. In this case option D: Where would it possibly be? is a good choice.\n2. In general, when looking for something in your house, or any place, you must know where you had the thing in the first place.

A red panda(choice A), a monkey(choice B), a bear(choice D), and a blue whale  (choice E) all fit the description with respect to how someone would uproot trees if they were to try and plant flowers.\nThey all represent animals that naturally and unpredictably uproot trees while attempting to plant or consume fruits or plants.  \nNow, comparing each option against the description we have: \nA. The red panda is cited as one of the most common animals that uproot trees. This means the red panda fits the description of the example very well. Since it is not mentioned in the description it is not a possible answer.\nB. The monkey was also mentioned as an animal that can uproot trees while planting fruits and plants, so this is not a possible answer either.\nC. A tiger is not mentioned as an animal that would uproot trees, so eliminating this option is easy.\nD. A bear was mentioned as an animal that normally uproots trees so it is also not a possible answer. In summary, the options that match the description are; B, E, and D. Since the description mentions a blue whale, the options that do not match the description are; A, and C. \nTherefore, we can eliminate choices A and C as they don't match the description and thus are not possible answers. \nNow, looking at B, and D, we can eliminate D.

C: gave up the idea of being a gardener. 4. D: found the right plants. 5. E: took gardening lessons.\n\nRationales: The problem statement asks us to consider the alternatives that the woman could try based on her previous failures. The woman was unable to keep plants alive, and she had already considered gardening lessons, so the appropriate solution would be one that allows her to move on and no longer engage in gardening activities. This narrows down the options to A, B, and E.\n\nStep 1: The best option to choose is B. She will give up gardening and move on to new hobbies.\nStep 2: A has been removed as this isn't a possible solution for the situation described in the question.\nStep 3: After eliminating option E, option D is chosen as the remaining.\nStep 4: Option D is not correct when examined in light of the fact that she tried gardening lessons in the past and failed. It contradicts the characterization of her being unable to keep plants alive.\nStep 5: She didn't get other plants because she had a green thumb, did she? She failed even after getting new plants.

Clay is a type of soil that's often used for plants, but it's unlikely that she would use it on her plants as they didn\u2019t thrive.\nC. Cucumber is a vegetable, not a plant.\nD. Bubble is a type of soap, not a plant. E.

Hospital: The same goes for a hospital, which is more likely used as a care facility for long-term illnesses or injuries. If a patient requires an oxygen mask, it would be provided by medical staff in the hospital or be sent to the patient by a healthcare professional.\nC. Clinic: A clinic is a type of healthcare facility that provides short-term, primary care services, primarily for health concerns such as allergies, infections, and minor injuries.

{"text": "got the job done, a plant had already given up on her. Choices:  A. the pot was too small B. she forgot to water it C. she put it in the wrong place D. she sprayed it E: the plant died\nRationales: First, let's consider the word that needs a definition: \"a green thumb.\" According to dictionaries, this is a phrase referring to having an interest in plants and gardening. There are several options available to choose the right answer, but this is an opportunity to make a point. \nFirst, the literal meaning is that every time the person with a green thumb thought she had done the job, the plant had given up on her. This is not relevant, we have to work with the metaphorical definition and what does it mean for the plant to have given up on someone. \nA: the pot was too small. This is a possibility in some cases of plants dying. B: she forgot to water it. Some plants need extra care and attention to stay alive. Certain plants require more care than how she was taking care of them. D: she put it in the same place. In principle, the plant shouldn't have given up but she never knew the exact needs of the plant so she placed it the same place it was given to her without considering if it needed more or different needs. E: the plant died. This is a possibility, but it might not be related to her specific actions, maybe it was simply not strong to grow with her caring. \nThis person definitely does not have a green thumb. \nAnswer: E: the plant died since the green thumb definition is not related to her actions.\n\nInput: You found a wallet, who would it belong to? Choices:  Winner A: the owner B: finder C: owner D: victim E: loser\nRationales: We can identify potential problems by trying to work out the correct answer and checking for the word \"finder.\" Then, we can use that to define the choices. \nA: The victor, not the loser. The finder would be called the loser if he lost something because he lost the opportunity to get the wallet. \nB: The owner. To get the right answer, we should consider the word \"owner\" which we can find in this choice. In our case, it means that if the rightful owner is", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "'d planted anything it wasn't there anymore. Choices:  A. water B. grow C. weed D. die E. harvest\nRationales: First, understand the question: This is a riddle that asks the question what she had. The phrase \"She sure didn't have\" refers to the person having the green thumb. The person doesn't have a green hand as it would be impossible to determine that. The second element of the question is \"a green thumb\" which further indicates that this is a person-related question.\nThe third element, \"every time,\" means frequently or consistently. This rule indicates that the person's lack of a green thumb is not a one-off but a common occurrence, suggesting that this person is unable to achieve the desired result.\nFinally, the last element of the question is, \"it wasn't there anymore.\" This statement serves as evidence of the failure to achieve the desired result, providing further support for the answer choice. \nTo summarize, the correct answers for what she didn't have is water due to her green thumb and grow crops because she lost her crop due to lack of water or growing crops.\nAnswer: A. water B.grow", "answer": " 300"}
{"text": "was ready to start gardening she would come up with what? Choices: 1 A: dirt B: grill C: grass D: garlic E: griffin\nRationales:\n1. The question asks for a common issue or outcome that could be related to her gardening. \n2. Start with each option. \n3. \"Grass\" and \"grill\" are not relevant to gardening, so exclude them.\n4. \"Garlic\" while technically related to gardening does not necessarily indicate a gardening-specific issue and can be used in multiple areas. \n5. \"Griffin\" is not a well-known plant and would be a strange gardening-related outcome, so it should not be chosen.\n6. \"Dirt\" is a common outcome of gardening, as one often ends up with dirty hands or dirt on their clothes. However, this could also represent other issues unrelated to gardening, such as laziness or lack of motivation. \n7. This leaves option \"B\" as the best choice: Dirt.\n8. As the term \"green thumb\" refers to a gardening achievement, a negative outcome, such as getting dirt on your hands, indicates that one does not have a green thumb.\nAnswer: B (dirt)\n\nInput: What kind of job could you use if you were not a writer? Choices:  B: farmer C: politician D: journalist E: teacher\nRationales: The basic question: What can you use if you are not a writer. \n1. Choice A: farmer. This is actually a choice of the writer. Since the writer is not a writer, they cannot be a farmer.\n2. Choice B: politician. Unlikely; since a person is a writer or not a writer, a person would either be a farmer or a politician. Therefore, it can\u2019t be this choice.\n3. Choice C: journalist. Not sure about this.\n4. Choice D: journalist. The word \"job\" is used as a verb: to do a job.

{"text": "was growing a plant, it died on her. \nRationales: We know to look for the clue that gives us an answer. This clue is \"it died on her.\" Since \"it\" refers to a plant, the answer is plants.\nAnswer: Plants\n\n### Example Question:\n\nExample Question: \"The first step is to understand and interpret the question carefully. It's crucial to check the words used, the phraseology, and possible implications in the question. Remember to eliminate the incorrect options as well.\"\nIf the question is \"What kind of food do you like the most?\", we might assume that there are different kinds of food, and that choosing one of those could be a good answer. Hence we can eliminate 5-B, 5-E, 6-A, and 6-D. From these, we can eliminate 5A as well because \"most\" is also a term that does not refer to all the food, but only to the best. This means \"best\" cannot be answered by a simple food name or a generic term.\n\nThen we can think about the words \"like\" and \"the most.\" This implies that the focus is not only on choosing the best food but on the preference for it. Therefore, we can disregard 5-B as well.\n\nThis means that \"food\" cannot be answered by one food, but a food type. As a result, 6-B cannot be an answer.\n\nThis means food preferences cannot be answered with a generic term, such as \"vegetables,\" \"meat,\" or \"all.\" So, 6-A and 6-D are disregarded.\n\nThat leaves us with food types, which brings us to 5-B and 6-B.\n\nIn 6-B, \"your\" refers to the respondent's food preferences, which aligns with \"food type\" as the correct answer.\nAnd in 5-B, the implications are clearer: the respondent would answer the question by answering \"their best food,\" which would not be answering \"food type\" but the single food. This means 5-B cannot be the answer.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently answer that the answer is 6-B, the respondent's favorite food type.\n\nAnswer: 6-B", "answer": " 50"}

Choice A: Mushrooms is an incorrect answer as it refers to a different type of fungi from plants.\n3. Choice C: Cactus can be an answer, since it is an example of a type of plant that can survive in arid conditions.\n4. Choice B: Waterfall should be rejected as well, as it is not a type of plant.\n5.

The sentence implies that the woman is struggling to plant a plant, and it could be failing to grow each time.\n1. Now, think about the answer options. We need to find a phrase or term that fits better and accurately describes what the woman did each time.\n2. A: make progress. This doesn't fit precisely as we can't say \"it stopped progressing\".\n3. B: got bigger. We cannot say \"it stopped growing\".\n4. C: became larger. This might make sense at first glance, but we can't say a plant became larger without explicitly stating the plant is bigger.\n5. D: expanded. This doesn't accurately reflect what the woman did.\n6. E: grew. The answer option might make sense, but it's better to eliminate and focus on another answer.\n7. Thus, we can eliminate all the options and move on to F: it grew. This statement accurately reflects what the woman did. In fact, it indicates she did the correct thing each time she tried to help her plant grow.\nAnswer: F: it grew\n\nInput: You could choose anything to be from. You're trying on a suit in the shop. The salesman needs to find out where it's going. Choices: A: New Zealand B: Sydney C: Singapore D: Beijing E: Jakarta\nRationales: The question asks which city is a possible answer. The clue suggests that the salesman (shopkeeper) needs to find out where a suit (item of clothing) is going, while the customer (wearing the suit) is from a location not specified by the question. \nThe suit can be sent from any city in the world to a customer, so the salesman must investigate the origin to determine the sender's location. The customer can, however, come from any city in the universe (e.g. New Zealand, Sydney, Singapore) and need not be the sender of the suit. \nLook for possibilities that are more likely to be correct. \n1. \"New Zealand\" is a possible answer.

Here, the main focus is on the difficulty the person has when trying to grow plants, and the various options can describe different factors that could contribute to this outcome.\n1. Choice A eliminates this as an option as it's not accurate. She did understand why plants needed water to grow.\n2. Choice C is more of a definition or example of what plants typically need. Therefore, it can be eliminated.\n3. Choice D is the answer because she didn't know how to take care of plants. She wouldn't learn about growing plants unless someone taught her.\n4. Choice E can eliminate if it includes additional details. However, it makes sense that she would ask someone when she didn't know something or how to do something.\n5.

{"text": "had a plant alive, it was always dead the next morning. Choices:  A. green thumb B. yellow thumb C. red thumb D. brown thumb E. purple thumb\nRationales: This question tests one's ability to properly assess and interpret a set of facts. In this case, we're presented with a seemingly paradoxical scenario of a person who always has dead plants, but believes they're alive, so they often choose to repot them or reuse them in other ways. As a reader, we must evaluate if this person really did not have a green thumb or was just inept at taking care of plants (a \"yellow thumb\"). \n1. To begin, eliminate the responses that are not applicable. Yellow thumb is not an adjective that correctly describes someone, so we can eliminate option B. Red thumb is the same, so we can eliminate C. Brown thumb is another adjective that does not properly describe a person's skill at plant care, so we can eliminate D. Purple thumb is another potential option, but it has no relevance to the scenario, so we can eliminate \nAnswer: A. green thumb\n\nInput: What might the person want if they are not sure. Choices: A: yes B: maybe C: yes or no D: maybe E: yes or no\nRationales: These questions test one's ability to assess and interpret a statement. If we're unsure about something, it usually refers to a lack of certainty or confidence and the need for further information to make a decision. This question asks us to consider a scenario in which someone is unsure if they want to purchase a product, and to choose the most likely answer based on their current level of certainty. \n1. Start by eliminating options that are not relevant to the scenario, such as options D and E.\nWe need to eliminate options D and E because they do not give us any additional information. If the person is unsure whether they want to buy something, they are not necessarily asking for confirmation; they may be searching for further information to make an informed decision. \n2. We can eliminate option B as well, because it is an answer that provides some level of certainty, whereas the person is asking for a yes or no answer with no additional information being provided.\n3.

There were many instances where she \"thought she was going, to\" plant, meaning that she had intentions of planting, but her intentions didn't translate to actions. If she had a green thumb, why didn't she follow through with her plans?\nConsider the answer options\nA) died: This is not a common result of attempting to plant things. This would make the statement \"She sure didn't have much of a green thumb\" a little redundant.\nB) rots: This would imply that the plant died from the effects of the environment or disease, which would suggest that the gardener knew or should have known that the plants would rot, which is what happens to all plants, and would not be consistent with their intentions.\nC) shakes: It could reasonably imply that it was shaky or unstable, but not necessarily that it died.\nD) grows: If one \"thinks they're going to plant something, but it doesn't stick,\" the implication would be that the plant does not grow (or sticks).\nE) watered: Planting something is a step leading to growth. This doesn't mean that watering the plant is the only step leading to death: A dying plant can't be watered or fed by the soil.\nTherefore, option E: watered is the most likely outcome after repeatedly planting \"but it didn't stick,\" because a watered, healthy plant might grow in the next season or the next year, depending on the environmental factors that it's exposed to.

Flowers (option B) is correct as they are the result of a plant's care. Leaves (option C) are simply the structure of the plant, and stalk (choice D) is the plant's support structure; therefore none of these 3 can be the right answer. 2. \"No fruit\" can be the answer but is not the usual result of taking care of a plant at least not in most cases, so it cannot be the right answer in this situation.\n3.

A: B: Planting seeds could be a choice, but the phrase \"thought she was\" suggests that the person may not have the skill or knowledge necessary to garden, so this is an unlikely choice.  \n2.

{"text": "was watering her plants, they ______ Choices:  A. grew B. drank C. died D. wilted E. thrived\nRationales: First, understand the question: \"she sure didn't have green thumb.\" This phrase is used to describe someone who lacks the skill or talent to maintain a successful garden or plants. \nThen, we should interpret the remaining choices. Choices are: grew, drank, died, and wiltered. Grew and drank are inappropriate as they are not related to the plants nor show that the plants lacked talent, while choices C, D, and E all involve watering, a concept that connects to the phrase being used. This indicates a need to focus on plant care when trying to understand this phrase. \nFrom this we can eliminate A: grew and C: died, leaving choices B: drank and E: wilted. \nChoice B: drank seems uncharacteristic of a lack of ability, and instead fits with the phrase \"watering her plants.\"\nChoice E: thrive shows a complete understanding of plant care and that watering is the crucial aspect to take into account. \nTherefore the chosen answer is E: thrive", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "was taking care of her plants, they died. Choices:  A green thumb B flower pots C black thumb D sunlight E water \nRationales:\nThis is a story problem that is trying to determine why someone doesn't have a green, or healthy, garden - the opposite of a Black Thumb. \nThe question refers to the person\u2019s \"green thumb\" being a possible reason for her having a green garden, so D can be excluded.\n\nThe answer must be something the person does to their plants, and not the plants themselves. So, E, water, won't work either.\n\nA green thumb doesn't necessarily require flowers, so B is a possibility. But C can\u2019t work because the only possible thing that C can do is give her black thumbs.\n\nBased on the example, if she doesn't give her plants anything else, they'll still die. So A-Green thumb is the best answer.\n\nAnswer: A: Green Thumb\n\nInput: You need to remove the hair from your bathtub, how do you do this? Options:  A rubber scraper B soap C lemon juice D dishwashing gloves E steamer\n\nRationales: Option E (steamer) is not relevant to removing hair from the bathtub- steaming is likely to soften the hair, but it does not seem to be an effective method for removing it. Option C (lemon juice) is not mentioned in the prompt as being used to remove hair, so we can eliminate it. Option A (rubber scraper) is used to remove hard debris and dirt, but it may not be effective for removing hair. Options B (soap) and D (dishwashing glove) are both used to remove hair and are both possible solutions to removing hair from the tub. We cannot determine which is more effective than the other unless we test them.\n\nRationale: Option E (steaming) is not effective in removing hair, so we can consider it in our answer as ineffective.\n\nRationale Option B (soap) is said to be effective in removing hair from the tub because it dissolves the protein that holds the hair in place. If this is the case, then this choice becomes the correct answer even if other options such as dishwashing cloth do not have", "answer": " 1979"}
{"text": "planted something, what happened? Choices: 1. She put in a tree. 2. No plants survive. 3. She would kill it. 4. Everything would die. 5. The plant would grow.\nRationales: First, identify the problem with each choice. Choice 1: She put in a tree, so she didn't actually plant anything. Choice 2: Plants could not survive; they would eventually die. Choice 3: She thought she planted something but the only plants would be the ones she killed. Choice 4: It will die, and choice 5: It grows are not relevant as the phrase \"had a green thumb\" implies she has experience and competency in growing plants.\nNow, combine the problematic factors with each answer choice to determine which one best fits the context clues and sentence structure. \nChoice 1: She planted a tree, but it was not the type of green thumb planting she did, so she didn' t have a \"green thumb\". \nChoice 2: She did actually plant some kinds of plants, but these would all eventually die, therefore she didn't have a \"green thumb\u201d.  \nChoice 3: She thought that she could plant, but she didn't have the skills or experience to take care of the plants, so the plants she planted would eventually die, and so would her \"green thumb\" reputation. \nChoice 4 & 5: She did have some degree of competency in planting, but eventually, all the green thumb planting she had done died, so she didn' have a \"green thumb\" anymore.  \nChoice 4 explains why she may not have a \"green thumb\"; her planting skills were limited to the green thumb type of competency that she did, and as a result of not knowing how to actually plant, all her previous plants died.  \nNow, it's time to determine the answer. \nThe question asked which answer choice is the problem here. She didn't have a planting skillset that applied to the type of planting she thought she knew how to do.  \nShe put in a tree, but she didn' t actually plant anything, and all the green thumb plant that she previously planted died, therefore she could not have the \"green thumb\" that she thought she did previously. \nSo, out of", "answer": " 123"}
{"text": "planted what? Choices: 1: flowers 2: cement 3: grass 4: cactus 5: tree bark\nRationales: We need to understand what \"Every time she thought she plant\" means. In this context, \"every time she thought\" is not a repetition of a past action as in 2, but a statement of her own belief that she is planting something. It states that she is often mistaken about what she is doing, thinking she is planting \"what\" when actually she is doing \"something else.\"  Because the problem in this case was that she thought she was planting flowers when she was actually planting something else, the answer choice that fits the context best is 3: grass, making her mistaken about what kind of plant she is planting each time.\n\nInput: She was not at school, what she was doing instead? Choices: \t1: she was helping mother 2: she was sleeping/napping 3: she was at work 4: she was eating 5: she was playing hide and seek\nRationales: First, notice that the sentence is not asking us to select what she was doing instead of being at school. The sentence is trying to find out what she was doing, not what she wasn't doing. \nSecond, interpret the answer choices. The question is essentially asking what was she busy with instead of being at school?\n3 and 4 are not possible, as the sentence doesn't suggest she was doing homework or playing outside of school.\nNow we can focus on the remaining answer choices: 1-2.\n1). The only reason why the person could not be at school is if she was doing something in her mother's house. But the sentence doesn't say so, only that she is not at school.\n2).

{"text": "started to make progress it only hurt more. Choices:  A : water B: fire  C: wind D: rain E: dirt \nRationales: The question asks us to identify what happened every time she thought she was making progress. This implies something negative, and we might expect that water (choice A) or fire (choice B) would be the correct answer based on the question. \nThe answer could be something that only happens once, or something that happened on many occasions; either way we should eliminate choices C and D, which both imply an occurrence on a frequent basis. \nThe only choices that remain are A: water and B: fire. \nBoth choices are not correct as they don't make sense given the context and situation. Water (A), doesn't indicate something went wrong, rain is needed to make plants grow, and the situation the question is describing doesn't indicate anything negative happened. \nFire (B) on the other hand, indicates that something negative happened every time it was started but never finished. The question did not imply someone was trying to grow a plant. \nTherefore, the answer is B - every time she thought she'd started, something would happen.\nAnswer: B - every time she started, something would happen\n\n\n### Scenario:\n\nAnswers:\n\nInput: What do people normally consider as their worst fear?

{"text": "had plants she would water it. Choices:  A water it B water them C water them D water with them E water about them\nRationales: The sentence means that the plants never succeeded, whether it was because they didn't have a good environment or lacked proper care. \nLet's begin by eliminating option, D: Water. It's not a verb, it's a preposition.\nOption, C: \"Water them\" is also incorrect because it shouldn't be an action. \"Water them\" implies that there should be a singular \"it\" in the sentence, something for which there should be watering being done. However, the sentence suggests that there were several plants, and it was not possible for any one plant to be watered. \nOption, B: Water it. The sentence suggests that the plants were dead, and watering them would no longer produce any benefit. Therefore, this choice is not the right answer.\nOption, E: Water about them. Watering the plants is not appropriate, since it is already implied that the plants were already dead. This choice does not match the text.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Water it.\n\nAnswer: A: Water them.\n\nInput: What are possible choices when choosing a car service?

The sentence suggests that this service will allow a person to rent a car. \nStep 2 is to determine which services could allow people to rent cars. \n1. Tick A: service that repairs cars. This could be an option for offering vehicles that are up for sale, but is not a service that allows for renting vehicles. \n2. Tick B: place that sells cars. This implies that the place sells previously owned cars, not vehicles for rental.\n3. Tick C: car parts shop. This is not the correct answer, as there is no option mentioned here for rental services. \n4. Tick D: dealership. This is not appropriate, because it suggests that this service has vehicles available to purchase from them, and this is not a service that lets people rent cars.", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": "could grow anything, she killed it. Choices:  A-she was an awful gardener B-she was a perfectionist C-she wasn't very patient D-she died E-she watered it too much\nRationales: First understand the question.\nStep 2: We break it down. The first sentence is saying \"she\". What could she not have had? A green thumb, of course. This means she was most definitely a terrible gardener and couldn't grow anything.\nStep 3: Let's answer each option. A says she was an awful gardener or terrible gardener. This is most accurate; a gardener would be bad at growing plants and they will most likely die. So A is right.\nStep 4: Now, let's consider if she was a perfectionist, a pessimist, not very patient. \nPessimist isn't an option because she was terrible at gardening which means she probably didn't think about everything. This isn't a pessimistic trait. So, that answer we can eliminate.\nNext, we consider a perfectionist, she wouldn't die she would kill it. So that doesn't fit. This leaves us with not very patient which fits with dying and also it could imply lacking patience which relates to the first paragraph or sentence.\nStep 5: We can put this in terms of what was in the first sentence and it fits and makes sense. She was very patient as a gardener. \nStep 6: The answer is B: she was a perfection.\nYou could think of other ways to understand how being an experienced gardener could lead to perfection. An experienced gardener has been gardening for a really long time and knows how to do it well. So, an experienced gardener is similar to an experienced perfectionist who is good at their job.\nThat is the reason why C-died was eliminated.\nShe was an experienced gardener or experienced perfectionist as it was stated in the sentence that she sure didn't have one.\nAnswer: B-she was an experienced gardener\n\nInput: While he does like being around cats, his neighbors don't like that he keeps them.

{"text": "could grow what? Choices: 1. A: roses B: apples C: cabbage 2. D: grapefruits E: tomatoes\nRationales:\n1. The phrase \"she didn't have a\" implies that not owning or possessing a green thumb is the negative thing. Therefore, the option A: roses makes little sense; a person can have a rose-colored thumb, but not own or have a rose-color green thumb. Further, the same goes for choice B: apples. 2. Choices B: A and B: B both have in common that they are fruit that are not green. 3. The phrasing \"thought she could grow\" is a reference to one's ability to grow plants or vegetables, especially those that are green, such as cabbage. The phrase \"thought she could\" suggests an attempted but ultimately unsuccessful attempt. This makes sense for C: cabbage and choice D: grapefruit, making them the best answers. 4. The phrase \"think they could grow\" could likely apply to tomatoes. 5. The intended phrasing doesn't imply a single or specific plant, so A: Roses and B: Apples are eliminated. 6. There isn't anything that suggests grapefruit or tomatoes specifically, so if the person thought they could grow more than one thing and failed, choices D: Grapefruits and E: Tomatoes would make the most sense. From the contextual clues, A: roses and B: apples are eliminated. Thus, we're left with two options: D: Grapefruit and E: Tomatoes as possible answers.\nAnswer: B.

But when she thought about watering the plants, she was already late and the plants were already dead.\nC: This answer gives us false evidence that it was not done in the correct manner, but plants that are fertilized well shouldn't look sick.\n\nD: The incorrect idea is again that she didn't fertilizing them properly; but since the plants are already dead, there's no way to tell whether it was done properly or not.\n\nE: This answer implies that she didn't know how water plants properly, when the problem was that she watered them improperly instead of often enough, it is also not a fact that she wasn't aware. \n\nSuggested Answer: C: fertilized incorrectly \n\nInput: What can be used to check the air condition/heater?

{"text": "should plant a tree she pulled what? Choices: 1 A: a knife B: a weed 2 C: a spade D: a shovel E: grass\nRationales: The question is asking what a person might do when considering whether or not to plant a tree.\nThe options A, B, C, and D are types of gardening tools, while E, grass, is a common plant that grows on its own.\n1. A: Considering that the question is asking why someone might not plant a tree, it makes sense to eliminate choices that indicate a willingness to plant a tree. For example, the person may have a green thumb and be happy to plant a tree or could be a gardener whose specialty is flowers and vegetables. Thus, A: a knife can be eliminated.\n2. B: A spade is not necessarily the right choice as it can refer to specific tools for digging. Choice D: a shovell does not rule out the person's ability to plant a tree, as they could be using it with another purpose or for gardening in general.\n3. C: A spade does not exclude someone from planting a tree. It could be a tool simply used to dig the location for the tree and does not make the person incapable of planting a tree. This option can also be eliminated.\n4. E: grass is too specific as it is a general term that could refer to any type of plant. There are many types of grass suitable for planting and some are better suited to colder climates than others. It is more likely that the person would pull a weed rather than a grass.\n5.

{"text": "could garden, what happened? Choices: 1. A: flowers sprung up 2. B: her plants died 3. C: leaves were crushed 4. D: flowers fell off 5. E: dirt covered everything\nRationales: First, consider each answer option individually. 1. A: Flowers sprung up \n2. B: Her plants died\n3. C: Leaves were crushed 4 D: Flowers fell off 5 E: Dirt covered everything.\n5. It seems that all of the options have a common theme, one that involves a less-than-ideal outcome. The key factor to decide between the options is the usage of \"flowers\" in the answer choices. To understand why choice E is the correct answer, we must examine this phrase more closely. The sentence does not literally describe the action of \"dirt covering everything,\" but rather \"everything\" serving as a direct object of \"flowers.\" \n6. This means that the sentence is likely referring to what happened when flowers fell off of someone's plants. Choice E: Dirt covered Everything would be the only option that makes sense here.\n7. Now, it's important to understand that we are not looking for the best fitting answer, but the one that fits the context of the sentence and the meaning of the prompt.\n8. The context of the sentence and its usage of \"flowers,\" which are the focus of the question, indicates that the best answer is option E: dirt covered Everything. \n9. Therefore, if one were to have a green or not-so-green thumb, every time they thought they could garden, dirt would cover everything.\nAnswer: E : dirt covered everything\n\nInput: When is a ball placed in a pitcher's glove while playing baseball?

If there weren't other causes, these may provide the conditions under which other issues may exist, it's not the result of them. \nNow that we have the wrong choices eliminated, we can go through the right choices and see if there are any remaining that make sense. \nWe can easily eliminate Choose E.  How can plants die from 'too much water', or an overly moist environment.  We can also eliminate Choice A. The answer is given in the context that the plants die 'within a few days.'

{"text": "could garden. Choices:  A. water plants B. wear gloves C. talk to others D. buy bulbs E. keep watering \nRationales: In order to come up with a successful answer to this question, one needs to analyze the way the question is phrased. \n\n1. The first step in approaching this question is to identify the possible mistakes one may make when answering it. It is important to avoid making assumptions that are not supported by the question. For example, one may assume that the person in question is a \"she\", instead of a \"he\". Also, one may assume that all the possible answers listed in the question are equally likely, when in fact, the answer may be more specific.\n\n2. The next important step is to identify the key details in the question and use them to narrow down the possible answers. For example, the key detail in this question is \"wearing gloves\", which makes it unlikely that the answer may be watering the plants, C) or buying bulbs, E).\n3. Once the key details have been identified, the next step is to use them to eliminate any incorrect answers. Again, an example of this is the answer 'C: water a plant' that is clearly wrong because watering the plant does not involve wearing gloves.\n4. There is still one potential wrong answer choice. 'E: Buy bulbs', can be eliminated again, because wearing gloves is not required to buy bulbs.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is the 'B. Wear gloves' option. \n\nInput: She has a garden.

The rule says that given a set of items, we can represent how many different combinations there are of those items by taking the number of items and multiplying it by the number of places we are choosing from to represent the items. \n\nIn this example, if we wanted to count how many different plants there might be", "answer": " 2,950"}

A brown thumb is likely to mean a person is not very good with money but is not synonymous with always planting plants that eventually die.

{"text": "could care for a green plant she lost it! What does she have? Choices: 1. A: brown thumb 2. B: white thumb 3. C: black thumb 4. D: yellow thumb 5. E: orange thumb\nRationales: This question presents a simple challenge of interpreting the phrase \"have\" and the possible answer choices. 1. The phrase \"have a\" suggests something that is a trait or characteristic, not something literal. It doesn't make sense to \"have\" literal colors of fingers or thumbs. It would be like saying a car has a red color, or a person has a tall height. 2. \"Have a\" and \"have an\" are not similar to \"have a job\" or \"have a pet. They are idioms that mean \"have a particular trait or characteristic.\" 3. Choices A-E each list a specific type of plant that's often described as \"green\" or \"greener,\" suggesting that a person who \"loses\" all these type of plants might not be considered to have a green thumb. 4. The phrase \"lose all\" suggests to us that the person described in the question could not keep a green plant alive. 5. Choice E: Orange thumb: a person with an Orange thumb typically struggles with tropical plants or plants from hot climates. 6. Choice B: White thumb: a person with a white thumb can only keep plants that prefer cool temperatures alive. 7. Choice C: Black thumb: this refers to person who can't keep a plant alive, whether it's tropical, cool-loving, succulent, or a houseplant. 8.

According to Google dictionary, \nit is \"the ability to bring plants, trees, and other living things to life, to make them grow well.\"\nTherefore, we need to check if \"she\" has any green plants, and if she thought them to be weeds.\nOption A: \"dandelions\" are weeds.

It cannot be the answer. \nOption C: \"sunflowers\" are common plants found around homes and other places. They can, however, be grown inside and thus cannot always be an answer if the green thumb is only outdoors.\nOption D: \"grass\" is a common feature found in lawns. But it cannot be the answer to a green thumb as its color is not typically green. \nOption E: \"carrots\" are a common source of beta - carotene. But they are not a green thumb; they are not plants and it does not matter what color the food is; it does not guarantee a green thumb. \nOnly Option C: \"sunflower\" fits the description of both being a green plant and being a green thumb plant that can grow well and thus only Sunflower is an answer.\nAnswer: C Sunflower", "answer": " 14"}
{"text": "was watering it she planted what? Choices:  F: tree  B: grass  B: tree  F: weeds  G: grass\nRationales: Steps 1-2: Understand what each choice means. Here, the option B: grass is a misleading word because grass could mean \"gardening\" but also simply a plant. F: tree is the name of a type of plant but does not mean \"plant in general.\"\n\nStep 3: What does green thumb mean? The definition of a green thumb refers to a successful gardener or someone who has great success in the garden.\n\nStep 4: Understand what the question asks. What did she plant in place of the thing she thought she watered?\n\nStep 5: Compare the choices to the options that can be planted and see which doesn't fit the meaning of watered.\n\nStep 6: Answer.

{"text": "planted one she would kill it! Choices:  A. Red thumb B. Blue thumb C. Black thumb D. Green thumb E. Pink thumb\nRationales: First, understand the question and the possible answer choices.  The phrase \"She sure didn't have green thumb\" implies that she doesn't have the skill or ability to plant and grow plants, which is the opposite of having a green thumb. Choices B, C, and E are all not related to planting and growing plants, so they can be ignored. 1. Choice D: green thumb. 2. This choice makes most sense as the correct one because it accurately describes what's meant by red thumb, black thumb, and blue thumb. Black thumb and blackthumb are similar terms used to describe a person's inability to grow plants. 3. If a person can't grow plants even when successful, they have a red thumb. 4. Blue thumb is a term for a person who can't grow plants. 5. Choice A: Red Thumb. A person with red thumb fails to grow plants even when not trying. 6. A person with a blue thumb also struggles to grow plants. 7. A person with a pink thumb can't successfully grow plants even when they don't try. 8. A person with a green thumb has a strong plant growth and survival instinct. 9. Therefore, the answer to this question is D: Green Thumb.\nAnswer: D. Green Thumb", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "was on top of her plants suddenly they would wither and die? Choices: 1: A: too cold 2: C: too dry 3: D: fertile ground 4: E: perfect soil\nRationales: Understand the question: 1. The \"green thumb\" in this context refers to someone who has a knack for growing or caring for plants and flowers. 2. \"every time\" indicates that they weren't able to keep their plants alive even once, while \"plants would wither and die\" indicates that they do not have a \"green thumb\". 3. The statement \"She sure didn't have\" then implies that they're asking about what the problem was/is and does not provide the option A. 4. Fertile ground, too cold, too dry, and perfect soil are not the problem and are irrelevant to this question. 5. Answer: C \"too dry\" is most likely the problem being referred to in the sentence. \"Too dry\" would most likely affect the plant's ability to receive adequate water and nutrients, leading to the withering and death of the plants. The other options have very little information available, it's either no information or irrelevant information, which doesn't explain why they wouldn't have a green hand and we can't make an answer, therefore C is correct \"too dry\".\nAnswer: C) too dry\n\nInput: She's been told that she has an acute awareness of coloring.

Choices:  D: take a plane ride E: go home F: have fun G: visit a friend H: drive a car\nRationales\uff1a 1. First, it's important to read the entire sentence and understand the context of the question. The phrase 'The boy...' may refer to a specific boy, or it may act as a general description of a child. \n2. It's essential to consider the options available and their potential implications. For each option, ask yourself: could this be something a boy would do? \n3. Option D is logical if the boy would be traveling for vacation. This might be a possibility, but it still doesn't fit with the rest of the statement.\n4. Option E is also not likely, as it suggests the boy went home, potentially because he was not enjoying the party or didn't want to participate. \n5. Options F and G may not be relevant, as they suggest the boy doing something, not something he does next. \n6. Answer Choice H: drive a car, is the most suitable answer. A boy may go for a joyride, but it's unlikely that it will result in going home. Driving a car is something boys might do, and it could be related to the event where he was acting inappropriately.\nAnswer: H: drive a car \uff01\n\nInput: How does a boat ride get rid of sea", "answer": " 54"}
{"text": "could grow something she made her room stinks, every time she took care of a plant it just died. Choices:  A. died C. green thumb B. stinks D. thrive E. smells\nRationales: The passage describes a person who has multiple attempts at growing plants but constantly fails, leaving their room with a bad smell. The word \"thrive\" refers to a plant growing and performing well, so this cannot be the answer. The phrase \"making her room stinks\" could refer to the resulting bad smell from dead or dying plants, but this is not directly related to the green thumb, so choice C: green thumb is not a suitable answer to the question. Choice D: thrive means to prosper, so this cannot be correct either. Finally, choice E: smells is the answer. It is the only option that can be used to replace the green thumb and the wording \"making her room stink\" to describe this situation.\nAnswer: E. smells\n\nInput: On this 2012 yearly citation how does it compare 2011?

{"text": "killed the house plant? Choices: 1. A: bored 2. B: drowned 3. C: wilted 4. D: root 5. E: died\nRationales: The question asks us to list the possible reasons for a houseplant's failure, indicating that choice A: bored is a possible reason, and the sentence provides us with a clue, saying every time. This means we can eliminate Choice B: Drowned and Choice C: Wilted as the question is too specific for these choices to be true all of the time. \nThe next step is to identify the true reasons for failure Choices D: Root, and E: Died. These are the most likely choices as the sentence states that they killed the houseplant each time. \nThus, the answer is D: Root and E: Died\nAnswer: D: Root, E: Died\n\nInput: If this were happening, I would be very anxious. Choices: A: having a baby B: meeting a famous person C: going through a divorce D: getting a job E: getting married\nRationales: This question is asking us to infer what one would feel if this were happening. Our first step is to understand and interpret the possibilities: A: having a child, B: meeting a famous celebrity, C: going through a marriage, D: getting a job, and E: getting married.\nFirst, we can eliminate choices that don't make sense. Choice E can be eliminated because being married isn't a significant event that could produce anxiety. A famous person C is not a person one would feel anxiety around, so the phrase \"if this were happening\" would refer to Choices A: childbirth, B: marriage, C: divorce, and D: job. \nConsidering Choices, A: childbirth is not something that is common and would make a person anxious, Choice C: divorce would make sense for someone who fears divorce, and Choice D: job change would make sense for someone worried about being unemployed or losing their job.\nSo, we can eliminate choices C: divorce and D: job change and we have a situation where A: childbirth and C: divorce are the possibilities, however choice B: meeting a famous celeb is not, so our answer", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": "had planted a tree what was the result, and answer was it was brown? Choices: 1: Dead 2: Wrong 3: Didn't water it 4: Green thumb and 5: Wrong\nRationales: The question asks us to identify what the individual did wrong in their planting attempt, which was not successful.\nFirst, we eliminate the choices that are incorrect. It is not possible for it to be choice 2: Wrong as the individual could not have thought they had planted a tree when they planted a bush or a flower; choice 3: Didn\u2019t water it can be eliminated.\nNext, let's consider choice 4: Green Thumb, which is incorrect for at least three reasons. First, being mistaken for planting a tree versus a bush/flower and having a green thumb are two different things; second, not every person can be described as having a green thumb and it does not imply that one would not have watered the plant thoroughly if their thumb was green; third, if a person had a green thumb, it would result in a tree in the best-case scenario, not a bush with green leaves.\nFinally, option 5, Wrong, is a good choice. This is the logical answer as planting a bush with green leaves is definitely not the same as planting and growing a tree. \nTherefore, the answer is 5: Wrong.\nAnswer: 5: Wrong", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "was about to grow plants something would happen, and most of the time it didn\u2019t have to do with rain or sunlight.\nRationales: The answer to this question is that the character didn't have a \u201cgreen\u201d thumb because every time she thought she had grown a plant, something would happen\u2014and it wasn't always related to rain or sunlight. \nThe key to this question is to understand the phrase \u201cgreen thumb.\u201d It indicates a natural ability or aptitude for gardening, as opposed to planting something and waiting to see if it grows. \nThe rest of the sentence indicates that the woman has had several gardening projects go wrong, which means it's unlikely she has a green thumb if she keeps failing. \nThe key is to focus on what she tried and failed while gardening and not on what she thought she was about growing. This indicates that she's trying something but never succeeds, suggesting that the answer is not gardening.\n\nInput: Your friend left some of their things at your house. They want to buy a gift for you and it has to be in the room where it was left. What would they buy you?

This implies that our friend's items were left in our house, and our friend wants to buy something for us that is in that same room. \nA plant (C)\u2014such as a new houseplant to go in that room\u2014would be a suitable gift, as it would add to the decor of the room and make it more pleasant to be in. \nA book (D)\u2014such as a book on the subject of gardening or home decorating\u2014could also be a suitable gift as it would provide knowledge in the room's theme. \nFlowers (E)\u2014such as a bouquet of fresh flowers in bloom or a planter with a floral arrangement of live plants that will continue to grow and brighten up the room over time\u2014would be a good gift if we want something long-lasting. \nMoney (F) could also be considered if you wish for", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "needed one she stabbed herself. Choices:  A. dumbass B. idiotic C. stupid D. ridiculous E. stupid\nRationales: First, let's define the term \"dumbass\" as used in the puzzlefight. It is not a clinical definition but rather a slang word, used in contexts that may vary from a mild insult to a more offensive or degrading connotation. There are multiple variations of the word \"dumbass,\" such as \"dumbass idiot\" and \"dumbass moron,\" which indicate differing degrees of rudeness, ignorance, or stupidity. For the sake of this problem, the term \"dumb ass\" will be used, without specifying the other variations.\n\nNow, let's apply that definition to each response and select the best response. The first step is, as always, to understand the context and the question itself. Consider the following example:\n\nA: He was such a dumbass, thinking he was actually smart.\nThe sentence clearly implies that the speaker of the sentence thinks that the person referred to in the sentence is stupid or unintelligent, suggesting that dumbass, in this case, is a derogatory term referring to an individual who is ignorant or lacking in common sense.\n\nB: She is such an idiotic moron, the police should have taken her in already.\nThis example indicates that dumbass is being used in a derogatory manner, possibly indicating an unintelligent person, and it could also imply that moron is a derogatory alternative to dumbass in this context.\n\nC: He's such a stupid fool, I don't know why people listen to him.\nThis example clarifies that the term dumbass is not always derogatory, and it can also be used to describe someone who has made a stupid mistake or done something foolish. In this case, the use of \"fool\" could also indicate the target of the word as someone unintelligent or ignorant.\n\nD: There's no way this town could vote for that stupid idiot, he's way too stupid.\nThis sentence is different from the previous examples in that it specifies the speaker's opinion, indicating that \"stupid idiot\" is a derogatory description of the politician", "answer": " 12"}

The question is ambiguous and does not contain the word \"and,\" which typically indicates that multiple events or conditions have occurred.

However, the question was asked as a fact-checking question, so a positive or negative indicator with strong evidence would be more appropriate.\n\nIII. Choice B: She used too much water. While a valid observation, this answer doesn't confirm that the water was too much for the plant. In other words, the writer is not implying that the water was too high compared to the demand of the plant. It's also possible that the writer used more water than intended for the plant.\n\nIV. Choice C: The water was just right for the plant. This may be true, however, the question asks for a negative indicator. It's possible that the water was too low or overlooked a part of the plant.\n\nV. Choice D: The water was too much for all the plants. This is the most accurate indicator as the writer indicates that the water was too heavy, implying that the writer attempted to water the house with too much water in one attempt. By choosing a similar situation as her previous failed attempts, the writer is illustrating the likelihood of her lack of skills for gardening.\n\nVI. Choice E: The water was just enough. This would be an accurate answer if it weren't for one small detail: the writer did not consider whether the water was too much or too little.

None of these options is likely to adequately describe a person who doesn't have a green hand.\n\nAnswer: IV: \"Green again\", as green thumb is something that you have, so the statement is not true for her.

Choice A: Monday can be ruled out considering the fact that Monday is specified later in the sentence. Choice B: Wednesday can be ruled out since the sentence states that she forgot to water the plants on a day that is more likely to be Sunday. Choice C: Weekday cannot be the right option since that is not the phrase mentioned in the sentence. Choices D: Sunday and E: Saturday are the options left that fit the time gap required by the sentence.

We have a list of things that are in the sky, some more common than others. The question is asking which is most common, so we want to eliminate choices that are rare compared with clouds.\n7. Clouds are a more common occurrence in the sky, and thus would be most likely to be seen.\n8. Farting is not seen in the sky, so can be excluded.\n9.

The key words here are the phrases \"had a good garden\" and \"they died\". These words imply that something has gone wrong and the gardener seems to be unsuccessful in her efforts.\n\nSecond step is to eliminate the options that do not refer to either of these keywords. This means eliminating A: \"had a green thumb\" and B: \"had a green\" since these options don't refer to the key words.\n\nThird step is to consider the remaining options and match the keywords to each of them. The options that match the keywords are E: \"made a good food\" and C: \"couldn't make any food\" since both options indicate that something went wrong and the gardener was unable to succeed.\n\nFourth step is to identify which of the remaining options is most likely to be correct. This option should reflects the key elements of the question, while also having a sense of understanding and clarity to the reader. For our question, the phrase \"couldn't\" indicates that something was not able to succeed, while the phrase \"couldn\u2019t make\" implies that the gardener was unable or incapable of doing it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: couldn't.This option fits the most with the keywords and also has a sense of understanding and logic that can clarify what exactly happened to the gardener and her gardens.\nAnswer: C. didn't have a good garden.\n\nInput: Where does the person work that has a lot of pension plans?

Now, we look at the possible answer choices: \na) grass patch: planting grass implies it will look more like the plant than some other thing. \nb) aloe plant, mushy soil, etc\u2026: these are specific examples of what can grow from soil and may not be a good match for the phrase 'She sure didn't have _____.'\nc) trees: trees would probably not grow from the 'dirt' this lady thought was grass and trees are usually associated with a forest, not a yard/garden \nd) grass patch at a flower store: a grass patch would resemble what the lady planted if she purchased this, but it's unlikely the flower store would sell soil for planting. \ne) what she thought was grass: we know this person thought she was planting grass in their yard, so this is the most likely reason the plants resembled what the lady thought she was planting.\n2. Therefore, the answer should be e: what she thought was grass.\nAnswer: E, what she thought was grass\n\nInput: Can they not be in the way? Choices:  Are they in the way?, They're not in the way., They can't be in the way\nRationales: A: are they in the way? B: They're not in my way. C: They can't be blocking my way. \n1. Understand the words. Are they in my way? can be construed as: are they in the right or wrong direction for me or can I pass them safely?\n2. Move one: can they not be blocking your way? or can they not be in your way.\n3. Are they in the right direction for them or can you go around them? \n4.

She needed to keep the plant warmer or cooler E. Her plant was just bad\nRationales: Understanding the text is the first step. The sentence \"She sure didn't have the green thumb, every time I thought she was doing the thing wrong, the plant would die\" implies that \"She was inexperienced with maintaining a plant\"\nChoice A: Her plant was potted incorrectly could have been a part of why her plant died every time. But based on the text, we can eliminate A because She just got bad luck.\nChoice B: She knew what she was supposed to do but with bad luck. We can eliminate B because what if it was because she thought she was doing everything correctly? She still would have gotten bad luck and the plant would have died. We cannot assume that she knew how to care for plants\nChoice C: She knew what she had to do but failed at it and the plants died: This is a possibility but we can eliminate it because it does not explain when the plants would die.\nChoice D: She needed to keep the temperature warmer or cooler, plants thrive in moderate temperatures; the plants die because they were not provided the proper temperature to thrive in.\nChoice E: Her plant was unhealthy: based on the text, this is impossible because she tried several new ways to save the plant and it still died, so her plant couldn't possibly be unhealthy\nThe answer the question is Choice E: Her Plant Was Unhealthy, this explains why it died every time even though she tried her best.

{"text": "was watering it all she was doing was killing it.  Choices:  A. Water the plant B. Buy it C. Give it to someone D. Move it E. Try again\nRationales: The first step is understanding the question. The question asks about a person who is not succeeding in maintaining plants.\nThe next step is to consider the possible results. She could try again by buying a new plant if it was done correctly, but that is already considered an option. \nSo we need to decide which results are not possible. \nWatering the plant correctly is not an option. If she watered only once or twice, then the plant might survive. But if she watered it too many times in a short period, it might die.\nAlso, we don't know if trying again means trying to buy it or try to grow it on her own. \nSo the only remaining options are those that are more than a one-time effort. \nFinally we consider that giving the plant to someone is an option and eliminate it. \nSo we are left with options D and E, moving it or trying again. \nIf she tries again, it doesn't matter if she doesn't have any success (which is indicated in the options). \nSo this leaves us with options D and E: she tried again and she moves it. \nAnswer: E: she tries again.\n\nInput: At the grocery store what can you find that would typically be the only one serving hot sauce? Choices:  a. Deli b. Meat c. Dry goods d. Fruit e. Fish\nRationales: First of all, the question asks what kind of a store would have (or serve) hot sauce.\nThe option that has anything hot in the name is considered a possibility. And this is considered a non-hot item.\nAfter that, we eliminate the other options: Deli (meat) and Dry Goods. These items at a grocery store are not hot sauces.\nAlso, Fruit and Fish are not hot sauces, so we would eliminate them.\nSo the only possible answer is \"Meat\".\nAnswer: B: Meat.\n\nInput: What do you typically call a plant that you can eat part of or use medicinally?

It's possible someone who has a 'green thumb' may not have all the time in the world to plant a flower successfully, but that's far away from what they're attempting to do.\n2. So, we need to look at the options.\n3. Option A is clearly a no-go.\n4. Option D is probably a good choice but we'll look further.\n5. Option B: purple: Is likely a good choice, but we'll look more closely.\n6. Option C: dull isn't a 'flavour' of flowers, so we can discard it.\n7. Option B: purples. We have a winner for the answer choice. \n8. The purple is usually a darker shade for example, darker than a light orange like you get when you mix black with white.\n9.

The sentence above indicates that the person in question does not have a good \"green thumb,\" a saying that suggests good luck and success in gardening/farming. The question therefore asks: what the result of her work would be.\n2. Option A: green thumb. A \"green thumb\" is said to indicate good luck and success in growing plants and vegetation. Therefore, a green thumb would mean that the person in question would do well when caring for these plants and the plants would thrive.  \n3. Option B: black thumb. A \"black thumb\" is said to be a sign of poor-growing plants and unhealthy vegetation. Therefore, it would mean that the person had a poor \"green\" thumb and was incapable of successfully cultivating plants.\n4. Option C: red thumb. A \"red thumb\" is a term that refers to carelessness, accidents, and mishaps when trying to care for one's garden. It is a sign that one is lacking in experience or knowledge.\n5. Option D: soft thumb. A \"soft thumb\" is a term used to indicate a careless and unskilled approach to gardening. It is a sign of poor gardening abilities.\n6. Option E: soft thumb. A green \"soft thumb\" indicates a lack of care or attention to hobbies and skills.

{"text": "had a plant growing, what would happen? Choices: 1: she accidentally watered it 2: She cut off its branches 3. she forgot about it entirely 4. it turned out to be a weed 5. it grew into something weird, wild and unrecognizable\nRationales: The question asks us to determine the outcome of the person's plant cultivation efforts by identifying the most likely event that would occur.\nThe answer should most likely reflect a common occurrence or outcome of the person'she attempts to grow plants.\nShe accidentally watered it (1) is not a likely outcome because it does not represent a common or expected outcome of someone's plant-growing attempts, and can be excluded on that basis.\nShe forgot about it entirely (3) is not likely because it does not represent what an average person would expect as an outcome of trying their hand at growing plants.\nIt turned out to be a weird, wild, and unrecognizable thing (5) is not likely because the outcome is not indicative of the average person's experience in gardening or planting.\nIt grew into something strange (4) is not likely as it does not represent the most common or expected outcome of gardening.\nWith the above reasoning, the only possible answer is option 2: She cut the branches off. This represents a common outcome of gardening attempts when one tries to grow a plant from a cutting or stem. It implies that the plant will not necessarily grow, and so a gardener would likely cut off the branches to prevent the plant from growing further and absorbing resources from the soil or container.\nAnswer: 2. She cut the branches off\n\nInput: How is the car being washed? Choices: A: outside, inside the car B: inside out inside the car C: Outside the park inside the car D: Inside, outside, inside.

Reading the answers carefully, the only option that fits is Option C. Inside an outside location would also make sense which refers to Option E. Hence, the answer can be discarded.\nStep 3. Step 4.

What is a weasel tree?\n- Choice B: garden pine tree. The first part implies it is a pine tree in a garden, which does sound like something someone would grow. Unfortunately, it is a bit vague and we need more detail to answer.\n- Choice D: mossy shrubbery. This might be possible but there are many different types of mossy shrubs. There also is no mention if the weeding of this type of shrub is a good thing.\n- Choice E: garden lilacs. Same issue as above.\n\nNow it's time to start finding the answer by reading the statements and finding out information to eliminate other choice. Whenever an option is false, ask yourself if either of the remaining options could be true if one of them is false. This is sometimes called a biconditional elimination, which states: If exactly one of these statements is false, they need to both be true. So, choose one of the remaining options.\n\nIn this case - the person has been pruning in error so they keep under-watering it. The result is that the plant is dehydating and turning brown and shriveling, it is not even able to photosynthesis any longer. The person is underwatering it because they are not paying attention.

{"text": "would grow something it died. Choices:  A; not knowing what to do B; it was too wet C; it needed sunlight D: it didn't taste good E: it was too far away\nRationales: First, understand the question: the phrase \"she sure didn't have\" means that someone does not have something. In this case, it is a green thumb, which represents good gardening capabilities or plant care. \n1. Then, consider the answer choices: A: not knowing what to do. This means the lack of a green thumb is due to a lack of knowledge or experience in the area of plant care. However, this does not explain the reason cited in the question. \n2. B: being too wet, D: it didn'ts taste good. Like the previous option, these choices do not explain the lack of a green theme due to the reasons given. \n3. C: it needed sunlight. This option does make sense, given the information from the question. Some plants need specific levels of direct sunlight to thrive, but it is more a matter of plant selection or proper plant care based on the plant's needs rather than the gardener's lack of knowledge. \n4. E: it was too close away. It is possible this is true, but it would require the person having the green thumb to be growing plants close to them, which would be evident in the question. 1.

{"text": "watered her plant, she ended up smothering it. She had better luck with her lawn. Choices:  A. plant B. grass  C. flowerpot  D. tree E. bushes F. shrub\nRationales: The phrase \"no green thumb\" means someone is not very good at growing plants, and the example given in the question is of a woman who struggled with watering her plant to the point that she ended up smothered it. \nThe question then asks us to choose the item in a sentence where another phrase could also be used.

We consider three items in the list of options: lettuce on top of dressing, a mix of different vegetables, and boiling vegetables.\n\nStep 1: Lettuce on top of dressings should be eliminated from consideration as it does not involve any steps in the process of making a salad.\nStep 2: Now we consider the next option, a mix of different veggie. This could be considered a plausible answer as it involves the process of making several salad ingredients. \nStep 2a: However, we can then eliminate choice D: putting salad in ice, as this does not seem to reflect the process of salad-making, and salad made in the kitchen or other area would not be put in ice. \nStep 1: Finally, we consider choice E: boiling vegetables. There is a process of making vegetables boil before using them in a salad, so E: Boiling vegetables could be the correct answer.\n\n\nAnswer: E: Boiling vegetable", "answer": " 48"}

Choices:  A) Herb B) Seed C) Seedling D) Weeds E) Plant\nRationales: Let\u2019s take a closer look at this phrase \"every time she thought she helped someone else had to tend the plants\"\n1. Every time she thought she helped - what does this phrase mean? To help is to aid or assist someone in an activity you are both participating in. Think, \"I help you clean the garage.\" Here I am assisting you in your activity. To think is to consider something carefully; to have an opinion about something. She could be thinking that she is helping another gardener with the plants. Even if she was thinking of doing that, it still wouldn't qualify as helping as \"a green thumb\" is the capacity of being able to grow plants successfully. A gardener who is able to grow plants well is considered to have \"a green thumb\"\n2. In other words, when she thought she was helping someone else end up doing gardening, she might've been considering or thinking that she would help, but in the end another gardener had to tend the plant after the first watering\nNow that we understand what the sentence is trying to convey, let's choose which answer is the correct answer\n3. Choice (A) Herb - \"herb\" is a term people use to refer to a small green vegetable like parsley. Though this may be grown somewhere, it is usually grown in the house and is considered a culinary herb. This does not qualify as a plant that a \"green thumb\" grows well\n4. Choice (B) Seed - A \"seed\" is something that is grown from a plant from a flower or fruit. Many fruits and vegetables are grown from seeds. They are commonly found growing or planted outside. This does not qualifying as a plant that requires \"a green thumb\" to grow well\n5. Choice (C) Seedling - A seedling is a very young plant, which needs to be grown and tended if it is growing to become a fruit or vegetable\n6. Choice (D) Weeds - \"Weeds\" are small plant that grow with little effort. They require very little water or manpower to grow. While some weeds are considered \"flowers\" and", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": "was successful something grew, what? Choices: 1. A: red 2. B: purple 3. C: orange 4. D: yellow 5. E: blue\nRationales: For this question, it's important to understand the context of the statement about her having a green thumb. A green thumb is a metaphor for having a talent or skill for gardening or growing plants. \n1. The phrase \"every time she thought she was\" could imply that she believed she was successful in growing something, but this was not the case.\n2. This brings us to the choice set. Each answer choice represents a color that is different from green. We need to choose the color that is metaphorically associated with her having a green thumb, meaning that she was not successful in growing plants.\n3. If the phrase \"whenever she thought she had\" is replaced by \"every time she thought\" the answer choices could become \"not red/purple/orange/yellow/blue.\"\n4. This rules out option 1: \"red\" as it doesn't match the context of her trying to grow plants and failing.\n5. The same applies for option 2, \"purple,\" along with option 3, \"orange.\"\n6. The answer choice that is metaphorical to her having a green thumb is option 4, \"yellow.\"\n7. Therefore, answer choice 4 is the correct answer. The phrase \"when she thought she was successful\" implies that she was trying to grow something and failed. The phrase \"everything\" could mean everything on that one occasion was not green, including yellow, which is associated with being unsuccessful in gardening.\nAnswer: 4, D: yellow\n\nInput: Where does she put the new book, shelf or bookcase?

She thought that the plant she planted would always flourish in the area.\n2. She was wrong, but it didn't matter, because she just moved on to another flower. This was the time she planted the perfect flower, in the perfect location.\n3. Her flower always dies the second it's planted. No matter where she plants her flower, it will always die.\n4. This is why she thought she had planting the perfect flower in the right location.\n5. This is not why she kept trying again and again to make her flower survive.\n6. It's because she's loyal to her flowers. The dog at the house is her life. Her dog is the perfect flower, in a perfect location, so she wants to keep it alive, even if it's dying.\n\n### Test your understanding:Answer the following grade 3 math questions.\n\n### Rationales\nYou should understand grade 3 math, so the answers are the same as the ones you used to write the instructions.\n \n### Input: Fabric is cut in the store where?

{"text": "'d give the potato a try, the plant would turn yellow. Choices:  A. die B. die from neglect C. die from her neighbor D. do not die E. dye\nRationales: After reading the sentence a few times, it\u2019s likely that some of you will understand what the author means here. It\u2019s an admonishment to a child who was not very good with keeping plant alive. However, there are some people who could still use a hint about exactly how the sentence was meant. It\u2019s clear that the person wasn\u2019t great at nurturing plants.  A possible phrase could be that they had \"a brown thumb\" or \"a black thumb\". However, there are other meanings for \"a green thumb\", all which seem more appropriate here. \"A green thumb\" is a term usually associated with having a knack for nurturing plants. In some cases, it also refers to having the best technique for caring for a landscaped garden. \"A green thumb garden\" is also a term sometimes used, indicating the best possible skill for gardening.  In the context of this puzzle, those three phrases actually make more sense than the phrase used.  However, this question actually refers to the verb \"to give a potato a try\" and the results of that. The green thumb person wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain a garden, especially at a kid\u2019s age when it required work (as the sentence indicates), and the garden would likely have many more challenges due to a lack of nurturing.  Therefore, the sentence is actually saying that they weren\u2019t able to maintain their garden to the point that they were never green.  The correct answer is B: die from neglect.\n\n### Suggested Solution:\n*\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \"To give a potato a  try\" refers to  growing potato plants from spuds. The sentence implies the kid had tried to grow potato plants from potatoes, and failed.\n*\n\\item \"Die from neglect\" refers to  plants that don\u2019t receive care. The sentence implies the child did not successfully keep their  garden alive.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n### Demostration:\nTo make a potato plant, you start by cutting a potato in half, leaving the skin on.

{"text": "could grow something she thought she just had dirt. Choices:  A. green thumb B. dirt C. stomach ache D. hand B. E. knee\nRationales: First, understand the question by reading it in its entirety. The sentence is composed of two sentences. The first part of the sentence refers to a person who did not have a green thumb, meaning she was unsuccessful at growing plants or vegetables, even to the point of being certain she could not grow anything.\nThe second part of the sentence refers specifically to the reason for this problem: she had dirt, or lack of knowledge or experience. This means that each part of the sentence represents the entire thought of the person who did not have success in gardening.\nNow, consider the possible answers that could make up the phrase \"every time she thought she could\u2026.\"\nOption A: green thumb. A green thumb refers to a knack for gardening or plant care, and in this context, it would work as an exaggeration, emphasizing the person's inability to manage her plants or vegetation.\nOption B: dirt. This phrase can be understood in two ways: as an actual type of soil or as a slang word describing someone who is unsuccessful or unpleasant. The latter is more relevant here as in this context, it refers to a lack of skill or knowledge, aligning with the previous sentence.\nOption C: stomach ache. A stomach ache does not fit the phrase. It implies a physical discomfort, not an incapacity.\nOption D: hand. A hand, just like a stomach ache, does not fit the required meaning as this option could refer to a physical disability of the hand or simply to the act of moving the hand or hands.\nOption E: knee. This option does not fit either as it refers to either physical pain in the knees or movement, which does not apply in the present context. \nTherefore, Option B: dirt makes the most sense as it represents a lack of knowledge, experience, or skills. This phrase works as an exaggeration as it reinforces the person's incompetence in managing her plants. The sentence \"every time she thought\" implies she thought she knew how to grow something but was mistaken and thus failed.\nTherefore, Option D: hand or Option", "answer": " 14"}

The incorrect assumption with \"inexperience\" would be that the person who uses it is describing a lack of skill, not a lack of ability. 3. O: carelessness. We use the idioms \"green thumb\" or \"green fingers\" to refer to someone with a strong ability to grow and take care of plants.

First, we can see that the sentence contains the phrases \"family that resides\" and \"same country\". These phrases indicate that we are looking for a group of people, or family, that are all living in the same country. We can see from the question words that this is the type of family we are looking for. Second, we look at the answer choices and eliminate any that do not fit the criteria we know. We can see that answer choices W: family and X: nuclear family do not fit, so they are eliminated. Finally, we look at the remaining answers and consider which of them is the most correct.

{"text": "was growing a garden she had a problem Choices:  A plant grew B plant didn't grow C all plant diseases D all plant seeds E every plant\nRationales: First, understand the question by breaking down the phrase \"she sure didn't have.\" \n1. \"Sure\" implies the person thinks she doesn't have, but she may. \n2. \"She doesn't have a green' thumb\" means this individual does not have any experience or knowledge about gardening, or may be unsuccessful at gardening.\n3. \"She thought she was growing a xxxx\" indicates she was trying her best, but she didn't succeed. \n4. Now consider each of the options one by one.\n5. Plant B: growing plant. Growing plants are common in gardens; however, growing plant is a specific term for growing seeds.\n6. Plant C: plant diseases. Growing a garden includes dealing with plant diseases, but plant diseases are a particular type of problem that may occur, not something specifically connected to failed gardening.\n7. Plant D: plant seeds. Plant seeds are used to grow plants; however, this is not the answer.\n8. Plant E: every plant. Every plant refers to the variety of plants that can be grown in a garden, but it's too general and not specific enough regarding which plants failed in the garden.\n9.

{"text": "had plant them, they would die. What has to do with gardening? Choices:  the soil A: hard work B: tools C: a seed D: sun E: weeding\nRationales: The solution should match the type of work the gardener is inexpert at, not what work is typically necessary to maintain a garden. \nWeed plants are a common challenge for many gardeners, but the fact that the gardener was not successful in every attempt to plant does not directly suggest that they struggled with weeding in particular. \nThe gardener's failure to plant plants suggests they may have had difficulty with the entire process of planting, not just with weeding. \nOnly \"hard work\", \"tools\", and \"a seed\" are suitable choices, so eliminate the rest. \nHard work is an attribute required to maintain many different types of gardens, so it is a good fit for the question.  \nChoices B and D are also good choices, as they relate to the actual process of planting. \nTools are a standard requirement in every garden and a good fit for the gardener's struggles. \nAnd a seed is also a required item in cultivating any type of garden, making it a good choice as well. \n\"Weeding\" is a process that can be used in any garden and may require less effort than some other aspects of gardening, so it should not be considered a sufficient answer. \nTherefore, the best answer is \"hard work,\" \"tools,\" and \"a seed.\"\nAnswer: hard work, tools, a seed", "answer": " 46"}
{"text": "planted seeds, they would wilt too quickly. Choices:  A. Herb B. Flowers C. Bushes D. Vegetables E. Greenery\nRationales:\n1. The first step to solving the riddle is to understand the sentence \"She sure didn't have...' It implies that the person is making a remark about someone. \n2. In this case, the person could be referring to a girl, and she didn't have a \"green thumb\". 3. Now we need to understand what a green thumb is. Well, it's someone who has a talent for growing plants, and they can do it without much effort. This implies that the girl described in the riddle doesn't have this skill set. \n4. The next step is determining what it is about planting seeds that causes the girl to be without a green thumb. \n5. Well, plants need to have their seeds in the ground to start growing them. As soon as the seeds are planted, they need some care until they can start growing, and that's where the girl could be going wrong. \n6. If we put the two pieces of information together, we can see that the girl is unable to properly plant seeds, and therefore, she can't grow plants and doesn't have a green\n\n         thumb.\n    7.

{"text": "was watering it, it turns brown. Choices:  A) no watering skills B) too much humidity C) too much sunlight D )too much rain E) not enough water\nRationales: For the first question, we have to first identify the issue at hand. It's obvious that we're talking about a plant and water. \n1. Now, using our known information, we need to work out what type of plant we're talking about. It's pretty obvious from the words \"it turns brown\". If a plant turns brown when you water it, then it's likely that it needs the soil moist enough to stay green. So, our first thought should be how much water would be required to keep a plant such as that one? \n2. Looking at each of our answer choice, we go in our order as below.  \nA) No Watering Skills: Well, no watering skills won't work for keeping this kind of plant green. \nB) Too Much Humidity: This would make it brown because of too much moisture. So, this is not the issue here. \nC) Too much sunlight: It's very unlikely that sunlight would make a plant brown. If it did, the plant would either be overexposed to the sun light or have suffered from sun burn. This could mean the soil is not properly shaded. So, we're left with: D) too much rain or E) not enough water.\n3. Going to D) too much rain: In a nutshell, too much rain means that the soil will be too moist to allow it to stay green or any other colour, but this won't make the plant brown. \n4. Lastly, going to E) not enough: Since being too much rain means the soil isn't moist enough, then being not enough means that the soil is not moist enough. This is not the issue here, so we can dismiss this answer choice too. So, the answer is F) Not enough water.\nAnswer: F): Not enough water\n\nInput: You should try to be more accurate, it's about to get you in hot water. Choices: 1. B 2. A 3. C 4. Oops! You goofed 5.

'She sure didn't have\u2026' is a clue that the answer is probably not A: killed the plant. This implies that she is not skilled with gardening.\n2. B: killed the plant. 'EVERY TIME SHE THOUGHT\u2026' doesn't sound like it actually happened frequently, so this could be wrong.\n3. 'Washing the dishes' would be an appropriate result for the opposite of having a 'green thumb'. \n4. 'Letting her father do the work' seems kinda similar so far.\n5. What is left are C: and D:\u2026\n6. However, 'EVERY TIme she thought\u2026' can be interpreted as 'EVERY TImE she thought that she was\u2026' and NOT 'Every time she actually\u2026'.\n7. 'KILLED THE PLANTS' sounds more like'she actually did', so now she can't be killed the plant.\n8. This leaves us with D: Let the plant die, then replace it when her parents were over for dinner.\n9.

Finally, why does EVERY TIME SURELY mean something only when her parents are coming for dinner, and not other days?\n12. C: '\u2026with a lot more effort, even less water, even less fertilizer, and without chemicals.' this is not really a reasonable answer and probably the one that can do the most harm.\n13.

Here, the phrase \"she sure didn't have the green thumb\" is used to describe a person who is inept at gardening and grows flowers poorly. \nStep 2. Identifying the possible answer choices. We can start by considering each of the options: A: play her hand, B: give up, C: play her cards, D: throw in the towel, and E: call it quits.\nStep 3. Excluding options that don't fit the context and phraseology. In this case, A: play her hand would be more appropriate if she were playing a game of poker or some other card game, in which case \"playing your hand\" is used to describe the action of showing your entire card. In this context, it doesn't fit because the phrase \"she was sure didn't have she green thumb\" doesn't refer to a card game.\nStep 4: Same for option B: give up. And option C: play her cards would also not work because it's not the literal or appropriate phrase to use here.\nStep 5: D: throw in the TOWEL is a common phrase that means to give up on something, but this would not make sense in this context as the literal meaning of \"green\" for the sentence would be to give up in gardening. Hence, eliminate D.\nStep 6: The same reasoning applies to option E: call it quitts as it would be a grammatical error to use\"green\" instead of \"quit\", therefore B: give up can be omitted as well.\nStep 7: Finally, remaining option is A: play her hand. This phraseology makes sense if she is a player in a game where they play with cards, meaning it would be a logical explanation to say that she is playing a losing game, or continuing with low odds, resulting in her not having her green thumb.\nStep 8: So, the answer is A, play her hand.\nAnswer: A, play her hand", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "tried, her house was covered in black mold. Choices:  A. never been successful B. never tried C. never successful D. never tried again E: never be successful\nRationales: This question appears to have some common errors regarding the question construction. If the question were rewritten correctly, it would read, \"Why did she never have a green thumb?\"\n\n1. When asked to select an answer that best parses an explanation, it's important to break the information into its core elements. \n2. If we start with the conclusion, \"She sure didn't have green thumb\", we should first ask ourselves about her experience. Did she ever try to grow plants? It seems possible, since she might have tried and failed, which aligns with her house being \"covered in black mold.\"\n3. So, we can infer she tried to grow plants and failed. The question is then \"Why did she have a green thumb?\" If she tried and failed, how would this affect her ability to grow plants? It would be hard for her to succeed in the future. If she has an inflexible, rigid mindset, she might not be successful. A \"green thumb\" is associated with being able to grow plants easily, so having a black mould indicates she isn't able to grow plants.\n4. Another possibility is that she has never tried to grow plants and, therefore, is unaware of what it takes to grow them. She might think anything you plant will grow, not realizing that different plants require different conditions to flourish.\n5. So, there are two potential answer choices, either that she tried and failed, or she hasn't tried. \n6. \"Never tried\" cannot be the correct answer since this statement is false. She has tried and failed. \"Never tried again\" cannot also be the correct answer since she didn't try again.\n7. Hence, we can eliminate all answer choices except B and C. B: \"never has a green thumb\" and C: \"never tried again\" are both incorrect, so the accurate answer is C: never tried.\n\nAnswer: C: never tried", "answer": " 10"}

This doesn't seem to be accurate, as it implies that she unintentionall killed the plant, when it was intentionally killed. \n2. b: die vegetables - This also seems unlikely, as vegetables can die by uncontrolled environmental conditions such as excess sunlight or humidity, but that's not due a carelessness or inexperienced attitude. \n3. c: burn food - Food can be burned in the oven, but this would have nothing to do with \"every time she thought she did.\" If it did apply here, the correct answer would be option d, \"get sick.\" \n4. d: get sick - This is plausible if the person consistently burned their food, which could cause indigestion or stomach upset. \n5. e: get wet - This seems to be the most appropriate answer, as it's highly likely that a person who constantly burns food would be exposed to the fire and, consequently, get wet due to the wet environment.\n\nAnswer: a: kill plant\n\nInput: If you didn't have to do it, then the person is most likely what?

She didn't have a \"green thumb\" may be obvious, but let's see what more detail we have. \n2. \"every time she thought she had it all figured out\" suggest repeated attempts at an action rather than one and done. \n3. \"every time\" suggests that these events happen frequently, so we can eliminate options a and d (the only ones with a single event).\n4. \"every time she *thought* she had *it all figured out*... *made a mess*\" is a plausible possibility but requires a bit more context. Perhaps she thought she solved an issue with her plant and tried to dig her garden only for the soil to fall apart to reveal an ant nest. Not great, but not enough to kill her.\n5. The answer is b.

In solving the exercise, each word should be carefully considered and given logical reasoning. 2. The phrase \"thought she had a new one\" indicates that the person thought they had a green thumb and that they made attempt at growing a new one. 3.

D: plant in the shade doesn't seem right, either. Plants need sunlight to grow. \n6. We know the goal is to help \"her\" succeed, so she should get the most assistance possible.

{"text": "saw something she didn't, so she just called out the doctor. Choices:  A B:  green C:  thumb D:  doctor E:  time\nRationales: First, understand the question and then consider the answer options. \nStep 1: The first sentence suggests that the person is trying to grow something but failed or is uncertain about it. This is followed by a phrase regarding what one does when uncertain. \nStep 2 Now, we consider each option. Starting with A: green thumb. A green thumb is the ability to successfully grow plants or other types of greenery, so someone with a green thumb would be able to identify and care for plants easily. \nThis person isn't trying to grow any greenery or anything similar, so A is an incorrect answer.\n\nStep 3 B is a common expression meaning \"having difficulties in an area.\" This person may be having difficulties with something similar to greenery, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they have a condition called a green thumb. This expression is appropriate to the question, but not the best answer.\n\nStep3 C: thumb. A thumb is part of the human hand, and this word could be used to refer to the hand itself in various contexts. In this case, it does not seem to have anything to do with gardening or growing plants, so it's probably not a related answer.\n\nStep4 D is the closest match as it suggests \"doctor\". This could be an exaggeration of the situation where someone didn't succeed in growing greenery, so they thought it was something serious. However, this option doesn' think it's \"something bad,\" just a lack of skill, so this isn't the best answer.\nStep5 E could be a correct answer, but the wording of the sentence is ambiguous. It could be interpreted as \"every time she thought it was something, she just called out the...\", making time the object of the sentence, and not the subject.\nStep 6 Comparing the options again, we can eliminate choice D: doctor because \"she didn't have\" is associated with subject, and we can eliminate choice E: time because the context suggests that the time being called for the appointment is not relevant.

Choices:  B. D. C. A. E:\nRationale: the question is asking what could be done if you already know the food served at the new restaurant.\nThe answer will be a common term used to describe the quality of food.\nIn C, 'excellent fare' is usually used when the food is good. However, in this context, it describes the customer's experience, not the quality of food. \nSimilarly, in B, 'fine food' is used to describe the high quality, but here it is also used to describe customers' experience.\nBased on this, our conclusions will be D and A.\nD, for 'poor fare' as it is commonly used to describe the low quality of food served. However, in this case, it would describe the quality of food, not the experience.\nIn 9, then, 'cheap food' is used to mean the low-quality food. However, we can't tell if it's used in the sense of 'poor fare,' or the experience. \nAs for the fourth option, A, 'fair fare' describes the reasonable quality of the food.

Option A: A good listener seems more like \"green thumb\" than any other option. It does not seem like what \"every time she thought she knew...she killed all her plants.\"\n\n9. Option B: A farmer seems like more of a skilled person who knows their plants, rather than a green thumb type of person.\n10. Option C: This isn't a situation where you could feel \"very attentive to\" your plants. It is not a close relationship like parent and child, or sibling. These relationships may require attention and care, but the relationship with plants does not. Plants are not emotional beings.\n11. Option D: \"helpful\" is not the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to plant care. When one is concerned with plants, they don't think of other people, they think of their plants.\n12. Option E: \"Confident\" might be a characteristic one wants for a farmer or gardener, but not for one who is concerned with plants. When caring for plants, you are not concerned with your ability, you just put in the effort to make the plant better. Confidence is something more suited to a relationship or a person who is confident in themselves.\n13. Option F: Optimism could be a characteristic that a farmer or gardner might strive for as it can lead to better growth, health and happiness for the plants. However, the question asks us to choose a trait of 'She' and not 'She wanted to be', so option F would be inappropriate.\n14. Option G: A gardener does not need to be very skilled to take care of their plants as this is not a difficult task. This also means that a skilled worker could be more likely to have a green thumb due to their skills.\n15.

{"text": "had the right plant, it died. Choices:  A : no skill B: she was not responsible C: she was always on time D: poor attention to detail E: not enough experience\nRationales: The first step is to examine what was asked in the sentence. We want to determine what kind of quality someone demonstrates. If we identify the kind of quality, the next step is to consider which one of the options presented might be the best candidate for this quality. \n1. She sure didn't is an expression that conveys an idea of certainty about the state of the situation. \n2. This means that we assume that nothing could possibly be the case here except what's described in the sentence. \n3. The sentence then presents a description that includes the words \"she didn't\", so it would make sense to find an option that indicates that this attribute is absent. \n4. She didn't have a Green Thumb in fact, so it seems that \"She sure didn't have one\" would make a good response. For this case, it would also be a statement of fact.\n5. This statement does not indicate that someone is at fault for the situation, so we can eliminate Choice B that says that she was not responsible for her problems.\n6. The statement also does not imply that the person in the sentence was never on time in doing something, so Choice C is also a poor fit.\n7. Similarly, the statement doesn't indicate that someone did poor attention to detail, so Choice D is not a valid answer.\n8. We now have two options; one where the person had a good hand in something and another where they didn't do it well. \n9. The first choice, Choice A: good skill, would be an excellent answer to the question because it would be a very positive statement with a lot of confidence and certainty.\n10. However, we already determined that Choice A doesn't apply if she sure didn't have something. Choice C: Green Thumb, is the correct answer. The phrase \"Green Thumb\" indicates having a great handle on a difficult or difficult task. That fits with the situation described in the sentence.\nAnswer: C_ Green Thumb\n\nInput: What did they find when they went to the kitchen at midnight? Choices: 1. A: potatoes, B:", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "could plant flowers, they would all die. Choices: B: die, A: plant\nRationales: First, understand the structure and grammar of the sentence. This would suggest that the answer choices should be antonyms of one another, not synonyms. \n\nNext, we need to relate each answer choice to the statement.\nThe sentence describes a person who has difficulty growing or keeping plants, implying that it is not an easy task for them.\n\nSo, we can understand that an \"easy plant\" is in opposition to a \"challenging plant.\"\n\nAnother clue is that, in this example, the person was trying to plant flowers, which are herbs, indicating that our answer choices should be related to herbs.\n\nThe first choice for the question was \"A: plant\" which is not a plant since it is an inactive form of a \"green thumb,\" \"B: die\" means that it will not survive, which is the opposite of \"A: plant\" and \"C: live.\"\n\nThe same goes for option \"D: live\" and \"B: die,\" which is also incorrect since plants \"A: plant\" would die.\n\nThis leaves option \"E: green\" to be a plant, which fits the context of the sentence since \"green thumb\" is an active way of describing a plant.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is \"B: die\".\n\nAnswer: B: die\n\nInput: What do you give a girl?

Now, we can look at each option.\n 3. A: blue does not work. To have a blue thumb, one would need to have blue fingers, since \"thumb\" refers to a finger. \n 4. B: yellow does not work either. While having yellow or yellow-tinged fingers might be a sign of gardening, it doesn't match the meaning of \"green.\" \n 5. C: pink is also not a good answer, as it is not synonymous with green.\n 6. D: orange does not apply either since it does not have the same meaning as green.\n 7. E: white is one of the few possibilities, as white fingers might be associated with gardening. However, as we will see, there are certain drawbacks to white, as it might not be in line with the context of the sentence, meaning the original question. \n 8. Let's look at another way of asking the question. She sure didn't \"have a green thumb,\" (this) \"one of her plants was wilted.\" If we change the question to \"One of her plants was walted,\" we can see that the original question was meant to imply that she took care of her flowers but they were wilted anyway. \n 9. Option E: white is not the intended answer. While white fingers could mean someone is associated with gardening, it's the opposite of what is intended in the original question.\n 10. Therefore, the correct option is E: white.\n 11. Here is a general rule. The word \"color\" has two definitions. Generally when used in a sentence, it will refer to the color of an object.

Putting up a fence is not planting flowers.\n2. Adding an accent is not planting flowers either.\n3. Placing the gardening items in the greenhouse does not make sense.\n4. The answer should be something that fits the rest of the sentence which is \"every time she thought she was ____ing a flower\".\n5. To complete the sentence, we need to focus on the meaning of placing down. Placing means to put something in a particular position, and according to the sentence, it is flower.\n6.

Furthermore, the word \"but\" in the sentence introduces a causal relationship, implying that her garden will always wither away as long as she doesn't improve her skills. \n1. Choice A: never to be grew again is not a plausible answer as it implies that she'll never manage to have plants in her garden, which is contradictory to the problematic situation described in the question. 2. Choice B: full of weed is not a likely response, as garden is not always full of weeds, and withering away flower does not necessarily imply that they are growing weeds.  3. Choice D: thrives is incorrect as it does not fit the context of her inability to maintain healthy plants in her garden, thus making the garden die. 4. Choice E: it just needs less sun. Unfortunately, it's not something that can be fixed by growing more plants. This choice should be eliminated as well. 5. Choice C: withered away is accurate as it's in alignment with the context. Moreover, \"it just needs light\" does not appear in the sentence, but \"wither away\" does, so C: withered away is the correct answer. \nAnswer: C: withered\n\n### Instructions: The 13th in the year 1789 was a pivotal document.\n\n### Rationales: The answer should be the document that is the most notable in American history.

{"text": "was ready to plant a tree, it would die. Choices:  A : flower B: shirts C: tree D: tomato E: cat\nRationales: This question refers to the phrase \"She sure didn't have green thumbs. \"\n1. Understand the sentence, the answer choices, and the meaning of the phrase \"She sure doesn't have green thumb\". \n2. Flowers require different types of care according to soil, temperature, and lighting, and require specific planting conditions to thrive. This makes it most likely that flowers would require a \"green thumb\" to plant and grow properly.\n3. Trees are living organisms that require care and attention to grow and survive. They need sunlight, water, and specific nutrients to thrive and can only be grown in the right conditions.\n4. Tomatoes are vegetables that require a specific environment and require a bit of care and attention to grow well, making them more likely to not require a \"green thumb\". \n5. Shirts are not associated with the phrase \"She sure don\u2019t (does) have a green thumb\".\n6. Cats require a stable environment but don't require specific nutrients or conditions to grow, meaning they are more likely to not require the phrase \"green thumb.\"\n7. Therefore, from all of the choices, it's clear that D: tomato is the correct answer. Tomatoes are more likely to not need as much specific care and attention as other plants or animals. \nAnswer: D: tomato\n\nInput: We can assume that the person has a green thumb, where would they buy a tree, Choices:  A. store B. a park C. a greenhouse D. landscaping E. hardware store\nRational: 1. The questions seeks the location that can be assumed by anyone with a green thumb.\n2. Now we need to evaluate the answer types.\n3. Hardware store (choice E): sells items for home improvements.\n4. While a person with a green thumb might purchase items like shovels and seeds at a hardware store, these items are not specific to growing plants. They are used for a broader range of home improvement activities, making it less likely that a person with a greenhouse would purchase these items.\n5.

{"text": "was watering one part of the plant, she watered another. Choices:  A green thumb B: green fingers C: green shoes D: green nose E: green eyes\nRationales: First, understand the question itself. There is a person referred to as \"she\", and there is a plant which she waters. Then, we move on to the possible answers: \n1. Option B: green fingers. Green fingers are not associated with watering, as plant watering is associated more with green thumbs. \n2. Option C: green shoes. While green shoes may be attractive, they won't help her gain a green thumb. \n3. Green nose is not associated with watering plants. \n4. Green eyes can make a person appear attractive, but watering plants with green eyes is not related to gaining a green thumb.\n5.

Choices:  C: it stole a car and drove away B: there isn't one around D: the owner was looking for it E: the thief took it out of town\nRationales: This question is a logical reasoning task, where we need to find the \"contradiction\" in the first scenario and use this contradiction to identify the answer to the second question. Let's rephrase the question. \"The owner could not get in trouble. The dog could not get into trouble. Which of the following statements is true?\" \n1. Option A: It stole a car and drives away. This option doesn't apply because someone is only \"can't get into trouble\" if the dog \"takes away\" something, otherwise, they won't get into trouble.\n2. Option B: There isn't one around. This doesn't apply either, because again, one isn't blamed if they \"steal\" but also can't find the dog.\n3. Option D: The owner was looking for it.

This would mean the person is not planning to end a plant career yet, so B:\"I am so disappointed\" is incorrect.

{"text": "was watering the plants she was watering what? Choices:  (green thumb): A: flowers B: grass C: herbs D: the garden E: shrubs\nRationales: She isn't a good gardener. \n\n### Demostration:\n1. First, let's break the question into separate parts to understand each one. 1. She didn't have a \"green thumb\", which can be interpreted as meaning she couldn't garden well or had no gardening ability. \n2. Here is where it gets tricky. The first option, \"she\" is the subject, and \"was watering\" is the predicate, but these aren't enough. \n3. The question is asking, what was the other word before the word \"was watering\" that gives us the answer to what type of plant was being watered?\n4. To accomplish that, we must use a process called \"subtraction\" to get to the root of the question. To explain subtraction as best I can, once you get the subject (she), the object (what she was watering), and the predicate (was watering) everything else becomes the \"subtraction\". \n5. We're looking for the word preceding herbs and separating it from her. \n6. There's more work to determine if herbs is the correct answer, and the same holds true for the other options, with \"flowers\" being the most likely answer. \n7.

Choices:  A. no, it always came back B. yes, it died every time she gave it  C. yes, she didn't know D. no, it was a succulent  E. no, she didn't water it \nRationales: The question is asking us to consider a specific outcome of her actions when she killed a plant.\n1. First, we should understand that \"she kept giving the plant\" does not literally mean she continued to give the plant. It's a metaphor used to describe her tendency to keep trying despite not achieving any success. \n2. We now consider the other options, one by one:\n3. Candidate 1: \"yes, it died every time\" is a possible answer, but we need to know if this refers to killing a plant or giving a plant. If the intention is to kill a plant or make it die, then replanting it could then be considered an act of giving the plant a second chance, which makes it a plausible outcome. However, if the intention is to give a gift, then it would only make sense if the gift is being given repeatedly and there's no implication for that repeated, continued gift-giving.\n4. Candidate 2: \"it was a succulent\" refers to a specific type of plant with specific characteristics, and its ability to survive and withstand adverse conditions is already assumed as common knowledge, so it would not need to be mentioned as an answer.\n5. Candidate 3: \"it was a ficus tree\" is actually a type of plant, so if the intent was to destroy that plant, then it could technically be categorized as \"every time she killed a plant.\" However, when read out of context, the phrase \"every time she killed\" might seem like it suggests that the \"she\" in this context refers to someone trying to kill the plant, and not actually killing it. In that case, this would not be a plausible scenario.\n6. Candidate 4: \"she didn't know\" does not convey a specific outcome and is not applicable to the context of the question.\n7.

{"text": "was doing ok with it then it died within days of being planted. Choices:  A green thumb B: does ok with it  C: it D: being planted E: it died\nRationales: The first step is to determine what the context is and what it implies. The sentence implies that the person did not have a green thumb because, despite her best efforts, every time she planted something, it died within a few days. The green thumb is a term for having a natural talent or a natural ability in gardening.\nThe next step is to consider each individual choice in turn:\n1. Is \"green thumb\" possible? No, since \"a green thumb\" is the correct one, it is a noun phrase that doesn't work as an answer.\n2. \"Doing ok\" could be an answer, but this is not what the phrase suggests. Rather, it's about the way she plants the flowers and how her care and efforts affect their growth and survival.\n3. \"Planted\" generally only refers to the act of putting something in the ground, not the plant itself.\n4. \"Died\" is an accurate description of what happened to the plants, but it doesn't refer to the woman in the sentence.\n5. \"it\" could likely be referring to \"the green thumb\", but it would likely also refer to the plants as they all suffered the same fate.\n6. The correct answer is C: \"it\".

{"text": "is good she grew her plants, how did she grow them? Choices: 1 A: watered them 2 B: forgot to water them 3 C: planted them 4 D: gave up 5 E: none\nRationales: First, we need to consider what the question is asking us. The question suggests that someone has a green thumb, while also informing that what they thought they would be \"good\" at wasn't the case. We'll call this \"person X\", and examine the options for how they grew the plant in question. \nOption 1: Watered them. This option is not appropriate because it is the first response we will eliminate. The sentence indicates that what \"person X\" thought they had a green thumb for was actually not the case.\nOption 2: Forgot to water them. This too is not the correct answer as the sentence clearly indicates that \"person X\" knows how to water the plants. If they knew how, they would not have forgotten.\nOption 3: Planted them. This option is correct. The sentence indicates that \"person X\", although they had a \"good green thumb\", did not know how to properly water their plants, which makes this option correct. \nOption 4, Give up. This is a possible option, as it could be interpreted as \"X\" giving up on using the plant they were attempting to grow. However, this is not the case, as the sentence states that \"X\" was not at fault, implying that their intention was to grow this plant and their \"good green thumb\" was not showing.\nOption 5: None of the above. This is the correct option, as none of the options indicate the plant's growth.

{"text": "was on the verge of some progress it became withered, what did she have? Choices:  T: yellow thumb A: blue thumb B: brown thumb C: no thumb D: broken thumb\nRationales: The question asks about the nature of someone's thumb, and the answer must be a color.\n1. Start by eliminating any choices that don't have a color. This leaves us with T: yellow thumb and B: brown thumb.\n2. Now, we examine the other choices, T: yellow thumb and A: blue thumb. The \"her\" in this context could refer to a female gardener. Hence, A: blue thumb is less likely as a color someone would refer to the thumb of the female gardener. \n3. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B: brown thumb, and so a woman can't be the subject in this sentence. We're left with choice T: yellow thumb and choice A: blue thumb, both of which are colors one could use to refer to the thumb of a female gardener.\n4.

{"text": "had a green thumb. Choices:  A. Throw her in the pond B. Clean her hands C. She wouldn't keep it up all the time D.

This doesn't seem to be related to gardening, so it's eliminated.\nB: \"cleaning her hands\" doesn't seem to fit the proverbial context. It's also more commonly associated with hygiene rather than gardening. It's therefore also eliminated.\nC: \"she wouldn't keep it [a green thumb] up all the time\" indicates that someone did have a green thumb, but then lost it, making it unable to be a correct answer in this context.\nD: \"She used to practice\" indicates that someone was once an excellent gardener with a green thumb, but now they're not. This fits with the idea of losing it, implying that someone did in fact have a green thumb. It's eliminated. \nThe answer is therefore D: She used to practice. This choice is consistent with the context of the expression and the example sentence. It describes someone who has lost their green thumb, demonstrating that the previous question was figurative, indicating that they did have a natural ability to be a good gardener and care for plants.

{"text": "was watering her plants, she actually put what on? Choices:  B: fertilizer  C: dirt  A: water  D: insecticides  E: flowers\nRationales: Let's first consider the meaning of every piece of phrase \"She sure didn't have \u2026\". Here we have 2 words in a sentence. If she did sure have a green thumb then it means that, she had every single thing or characteristic which is required to keep some plant alive or even some plant healthy, thus it must be negative if any person didn\u2019t have it. The next step is consider the next part of phrase and it is  what she actually put on. It must be the ingredient for keeping plant healthy and it can be just one, which we mentioned in first phrase. Also, it can be just one out of 5 ingredients which includes: 1. Fertilizer, 2. Dirt or just 3. Water.\n4. So, it must only be two out of the 5.\n5. Now, let\u2019s start by excluding the answers with more than 2 words, as these must be the opposite of her, so we exclude option A: water, and option B: fertilizer, that makes 8 possible ingredients.\n6. Considering that there are 2 ways it can be done, either just 1 ingredient or all 5 it can be reduced to 4 possibilities.\n7. As we excluded water and fertilizer which means that there can be just one out 5. So, 2 out 4 answers left which is C: dirt and E: flowers.\n8. C: dirt is an option if there\u2019s plant soil or dirt in plant\u2019s pot, which is pretty far-fetched and E: flowers is also an option if she wants to grow more flowers or if she\u2019s trying to make it less attractive to insects, as flowers are a common attractant.\n9. So, out of remaining 2 options it\u2019s C: dirt, which is most likely a cause as there is just one ingredient.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: What does one do if you have an allergic reaction to food?

Watering plants with a spray can may seem like a more direct alternative, however it's unlikely since it involves a specific flower type.\n4DI: hose spray: this is a very likely answer, as it's a direct type of watering which is more commonly associated with watering plants.\n5ID: using a water nozzle: hose nozzles are often used in spraying water, making it a plausable alternative.\nBut it's worth noting that using a watering noze is not a method specifically associated with watering plants\n6E: spray hose.

{"text": "was taking good care plants, they ended up doing what? Choices:  HAve green leafs A: black  B: rotten C: withered D: brown\nRationales: First, understand the question and the possible answer choices.\n1. The first step in analysing the question is to understand what the phrase \"green thumb\" could refer to. \n2. Green thumb is a colloquial way to refer to someone who is especially skilled in growing plants. \n3. Next, consider the answer choices:\na. Black: Although plants can change color from green to black, it's not likely that a \"green thumb\" would refer to this. \nb. Rotten: Plants can rot, but this isn't exactly what one would normally expect to happen when one has a green thumb.\nc. Withered: Withered plants can indicate a lack of care for them which is a potential connection to the phrase \"bad care\" in the context of the question. \nd. Brown: While plants can go from green to brown, we need to ensure that this is a possible result or consequence of not having a green thumb, not just that it's an option for a plant colour.\ne. Green leafs: Although we could argue that not having a green thumb could lead to green leaves, as it's part of the potential result of not having a green finger, it's still not a likely result of having bad care, so we should exclude this option.\nf. We can now eliminate all the options except for B and D: rotten and brown.\ng. Let's start by eliminating the most unlikely option among the remaining choices: A: black: As explained earlier, we don't consider a green thumb to be related to black plants.\nh. Moving on, let's eliminate the remaining option B: rotten: As we've understood before, plants can go from green (good care) to brown (no care), but rotten leaves are not likely to result from a lack of care. It's more associated with mould or parasites.\ni. Therefore, D: brown is the correct answer. \nAnswer: D: brown\n\nInput: Why is the boy sitting in pink chair?

{"text": "was planting seeds what plant came out? Choices: \n A: weed B: corn C: onion D: flower E: apple\nRationales: The first step is to consider the sentence. It asks about what might be coming out of the ground when a person thought they were planting seeds. When someone is planting actual seeds or plants, a plant, including a flowering plant, would typically be the expected outcome; but in this case, she did not have a green thumb and her efforts did not produce flowers.\n1. Each other answer option is therefore an unlikely result of planting seeds.\n\nA: weeds are unwanted plants and plants themselves are not unwanted, so this is incorrect.\n\nC: onion, E: apple. Neither of these fruits, vegetables, nor plants are commonly associated with planting seeds. This is why this incorrect choice.\n\nD: flower. Flowers are commonly used and cultivated as ornamental plants. They would typically be expected if someone was planting flowers or other flowering plants. But again, she didn't have a \"green thumb,\" she didn't have any of these plants, so this can be excluded.\n\nThere is however one correct answer, which is B: corn. Although she didn't have much of a green thumb, she didn't try to plant it anyhow. She just took things as they came and didn't try too hard to cultivate them. What came was therefore the natural outcome - corn, which is a plant, as opposed to any of her other choice options.\n\nAnswer: B: corn\n\nInput: He must have a lot of courage to travel to the Arctic Circle where temperatures are below zero Fahrenheit, what is it called Fahrenheit below zero degrees? Choices:  C: Celsius D: freezing E: cool\nRationales: So, what's the answer? \n\nIt's: C: Celsius\n\nThis is because Fahrenheit can be used to state the temperature in Celsius. The only way to use Fahrenheit to state a number would be if the number is between 32 and 212 and it's a negative number.\n\nSo, it's not Fahrenheit, it's Celsius, at negative 32 degrees.", "answer": " 21"}

The sentence refers to a person who is incompetent or unlucky when it comes to gardening. They are likely trying to plant peppers but are actually planting something else instead.\n2. Consider each option: Potatoes (choice C), Marijuana (choice D), methamphetams (choice B), Caffeine (choice A), Kale (choice F), and LSD (choice E).\n3. Peppers (choice D) are not what we expect to encounter when planting potatoes, a common crop. \n4. We can also eliminate Caffine and Marijuana as we don\u2019t expect their substances to resemble Peppers. \n5. LSD (choice E) could be a result of what we are trying to plant but can\u2019t be the actual item because it is not a plant.\n6. We\u2019re left with either Potatoes (choice C) and Methamphetamsine (choice B). While both of these are plausible responses, Methamphetemsine (choice B) more closely fits the criteria provided as it is likely to resemble what we would consider to be the actual plant.\n7. So, the answer is B : Methamphetamine as it appears to resemble peppers the most closely.\nAnswer: B : Methampehtamine", "answer": " 175"}
{"text": "killed the grass. Choices:  A : flowers B: weeds C: potatoes D: plants E: lawn\nRationales: Note that the option of flowers (A) seems to indicate that every time the woman thought of her grass dying she would have bloomed flowers instead. That is not the meaning of the question statement though. She was not blooming flowers instead of seeing her grasses die off. Therefore, A, flowers, is rejected. \nThinking of plants (C), this means that plants don't die on her so every time she thought she might have killed the plants, she actually didn't. The real definition of having a green thumb is that you can grow plants successfully, and it can be applied to plants in general (C) as well as grass (D). Hence, neither of those words could be a suitable answer to the question. \nMoving on to potatoes (B) - these do not have a color associated with their growth, and it has nothing to do with if she killed the grass or not. Thus, it is rejected as well. \nNow on to plants (D), and if the gardener had a green thumb, she would grow green plants. A lawn, however (E), has nothing to do with this question and is not a green plant type either. \nThis is why we cannot give the answer that the gardener has green thumb. She does not grow green plants, therefore she must have another type of thumb, and she did not have a green one.\nHence, the correct answer is C: potatoes.\nAnswer: C : Potatoes\n\nInput: He wants to read the bible in the middle.

{"text": "was making progress, she was taking a leap toward what? Choices: 1. loss of progress 2. failure 3. success 4. leapfrog 5. setback 6. victory\nRationales: Questions ask for the choice that most logically fits the given answer choices. \n1. First step: Identify the type of question. This is a mixed question, meaning there are both correct and incorrect choices.\n2. Next step: Determine which option(s) does not fit. As there are an odd number of answer choices, all answers must be present in some form.\n3. Finally, identify the one/s with the fewest matching keywords or characteristics. \nThis question can be rephrased as: Which of the following \"logical fit\" answer choices is/are least likely?\n1. Option 1 = loss of progress. There are no specific \"green thumb\" details in this answer choice. Reworded, it is \"She sure didn't have any progress, every time she thought..\"\n2. Option 2 = failure. There is no detail about how \"she thought\" she was making progress to make this answer fit.\n3. Option 3 = success. Although this could be a correct answer depending on context, it does not contain any matching text to \"She sure didn'tn't have a green...\"\n4. Option 4 = leapfrog. This answer doesn't contain any green thumb detail to match with the opening phrase.\n5. Option 5 = setback. This is likely an answer if \"She sure didn'nt have a green... was read as a statement of affirmation rather than a question about progress. However, there is no detail about green thumbs.\n6. Option 6 = victory. Victory could apply here as a statement of success, but success would fit better. This does not mean it's a wrong answer, but it does not fit the given text as closely as the other answers.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is either Option 3 or Option 5.

Identify the characters: She and \"every time she thought she had...\"\n2. Identify the action: She \"sure didn't have a Green Thumb\"\n3. Identify the consequence: \"she thought she had\" -> what would show up?\n4. Identify the time: \"She tried to have a Green Thumb, every time\"\n5. Review each option: \n6. A: brown thumb. This does not seem likely as a possible outcome given the context because it describes a different color than what the character described (i.e., green, red, purple, or yellow). \n7. B: purple thumb. This is a possibility because the character described \"green\", \"red\", \"purple\", or \"yellow\", which could mean either a literal thumb color or a metaphorical interpretation of a \"green thumb.\" However, it seems unlikely because the character described \"she thought she had,\" which suggests success in \"trying to have\" a green thumb.\"\n8. C: brown thumb. This is ruled out because the character described having a green thumb and trying to have a green thumb, so it is unlikely.\n9. D: red thumb. This is ruled as well because the character described \"thought she had,\" and it would not be the case.\n10. E: yellow thumb. This seems most likely because the character described \"trying to have a green thumb,\" as well as describing a different color, which is \"yellow.\" \nTherefore the correct answer is C.\nAnswer: C.

{"text": "was ready for how many plants? Choices:  F: two B: three E: four F: five\nRationales:\n1. First, understand what the question is saying. \"She sure didn't have...a green thumb,\" this phrasing suggests that she lacks the natural ability to take care of plants. \n2. We can then determine each of the available choices. \n3. Considering the phrase \"every time she thought she was...\", we can eliminate option E: no plants, as it can't be used for describing someone's skill. \n4. Options B: three, F: five doesn't fit as they could potentially say that she has a skill level in caring for three plants or five plants but it's not limited to that count in the statement, they're incompatible. \n5. This leaves us with options A: two or E: four, suggesting that she either has some knowledge regarding how to take care of two plants or four plants. \n6. While option E: four, does somewhat match the meaning of the statement, Option A two can be seen as more plausible as it matches the phrasing of \"She got ready in plenty of time for...\"\n7. There is a small difference in meaning, but given the available options, \"She got ready in enough time for...\" could imply that she was adequately prepared for how many plants, while \"She got ready in a few short minutes for...\" could potentially suggest that she wasn't adequately prepared for having two plants. \n8. Therefore, A: \"She got ready in time for...\" is more likely to be correct because it fits the meaning and phrasing of the entire question.\nAnswer: A; She got ready in time for 2 plants.\n\nInput: What does a person need for a toilet to be considered sanitary?

A: shacks cannot be the answer, because the cowboy didn't build it, and he was living outside of town.\n2. B : houses cannot be the answer because he worked as a cowboy, which meant he likely had more rustic housing. \n3. C : Townhouses cannot be the answer either. The wild west is an area of rural and uncultivated land. A townhouse suggests a greater proximity to civilization than the wild west allows. \n4. D: apartments do not answer the question as they're the kind of housing a person moves into when they've built a more permanent establishment elsewhere. \n5.

Blah blah blah\n\nRationales:\n\nThe question is referring to an individual who \"thought she was trying something to \"help\" it so she threw it away.\". It's unclear if \"it\" refers to a plant or the individual's garden. So, we can understand what the choices are in light of this context. \n\nStep 1: Understand the possible answers and their explanations. \nStep 2-1: Option 1 (There's too many rocks): There must be a reasonable explanation for why the individual believed this to be an issue, and also, it must be clear that this is a problem that's preventing her from carrying out her gardening plan.\nStep 2-2: Option 2 (How do you know if plants are still alive?): This option implies that there may still be life in the plant, but it's unclear if the individual understands this.\nStep 2.3: Option 3 (There's rocks in the ground): This could be a plausible answer, but we need to consider if the problem is with the individual not having rocks in the ground, or rocks blocking them from achieving their objective, which is planting the plants.\nStep 2: Option 4 (What do you mean, you're killing plants?) implies that the person might take offense or be unaware of the effect their actions have on the plants they plant, making this a plausible explanation.\nStep 2-.5: Option 5 (I don't know what you're missing): This option implies that the individual doesn't fully grasp the situation and could benefit from better information to make a decision.\n\nSo, now that we've gone through all the possible answers and their rationales,", "answer": " 1080"}

{"text": "could her flowers would die? Choices: 1: green skin 2: green light 3: be green 4: not green 5: go green\nRationales: First things first, understand the question. We're looking for a situation where someone tried to make their flowers green but couldn't, implying that they had a \"green thumb\" or the ability to maintain healthy, green flowers. \nSecond, understand the possible answer choices. There are many possible interpretations, so we need to consider the context and the meaning of the words. \nChoice 1: \"green skin\". This is not applicable because this sentence doesn't mention anything about skin color. Choice 2: \"green light\". This is not applicable as it's still referring to flowers. Choice 3: \"be green\". This could be interpreted to mean that the person's thoughts or actions are green, but this doesn't quite fit the situation as it describes someone who tries to make things green, not someone who is naturally green. Choice 4: \"not green\". This describes someone who is the opposite of green, having no connection to flowers or gardening at all. Choice 5: \"go green\". This is a term used to describe someone who is environmentally conscious or involved in environmental movements. However, this term doesn't necessarily have a connection to flowers or garden. \nUltimately, we can eliminate choices 1-4 as they don't quite fit the context or the intended meaning. Choice 5, \"go green,\" is more closely related to the question and could imply the same meaning as \"have a green thumb,\" but it's not explicit enough for this to be a definite answer. But choice 5, \"go\" is a directional word and can imply movement and not necessarily permanency. The other choices don't use this word.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is choice 5, \"have a green thumb\". This accurately reflects the situation where a person tried and failed to grow green flowers, indicating that she lacked the ability or necessary skills to maintain healthy, growing green flowers.\nAnswer: C, Have a green thumb\n\n### Rationales\nInput: How can you make your bedroom feel more personal?

We also need to understand the term green thumb.\n10. \"green thumb\" is the ability to cultivate plants and produce healthy, successful, abundant growth, as opposed to other gardening skills or green fingers.\n11. The phrase \"every time she thought\" is suggesting they were always thinking about green thumb.\n12. It is implied from question that the color of her thumb would be either green or red.\n13. \"She\" seems to say more like someone with green thumb rather than someone with red fingers.\n14. When using the color references, \"green\" is a color not associated with red, and \"red\" is more associated with roses.\n15. It's easier to say red hands rather than green hands.\n16. It is said here that she doesn't have green thumb or plants that survived.

She doesn't know how to take care of them properly.\n3. She needs to learn something new: pruning or fertilizing. \n4. A green thumb implies ability so option A: fertilizer C: irrigation E: shovel are not likely answers for her as none of those terms are relevant for a green thumb. \n5. Water: B: pruning, C: irrigation are two possibilities that may have caused her to have a bad experience with her plants.\n6.

We start by selecting the number that would most commonly appear in addition to the other numbers, in this case, 20K.\n3. We then add it to the total of all the numbers to come up with 25.5B.\n4. To determine the average, we want to divide the sum of the total by 20,000 to come up with 1,250.5, which is the correct answer. \nAnswer: 1250.5", "answer": " 200"}
{"text": "made an improvement her plants would die. Choices:  A. she was growing trees B. she was a farmer C. she was very busy D. it was the fault of her children E. she was an herbalist.\nRationales: In order to select the correct answer, we must first understand the context of the idiom \"green thumb.\" This idiom refers to someone who has a knack or aptitude for gardening, typically having a talent for growing and taking care of plants.\nThe question asks about a person who doesn't have a green \"thumb,\" indicating that this individual does not have a talent for gardening or a natural ability to care for plants.\n\nBy considering each of the possible answer choices, we can narrow down the options that are most likely to be correct.\n\nOption A: \"She was growing trees,\" is not consistent with the context of an individual with a green thumb. Trees are not typically considered to be plants or herbs that require care and maintenance.\n\nOption B: \"She was a farmer\" fits the context of an individual growing plants and herbs, but it is not specific enough to be a likely answer.\n\nOption C: \"She was very busy\" does not reflect the negative connotation of the idiom \"a green thumb.\"\n\nOption D: \"It was the fault of her Children,\" while a plausible answer that provides an explanation for the failure of the plants, is not reflected in the specific idiom \"a green\".\nOption E: \"She was an herbalist\" is a likely answer, as herbalism often requires care and maintenance of plants and herbs. It also has the added benefit of being an explanation of why her plants would frequently \"die\", which is implied by the use of the idiom \"make an improvement\".\nThus, the correct answer would be E: She was an herbalist, as she had a natural ability and talent for herbalism.\nAnswer: E She was an herbalists.\n\n*Input: Where do they go to watch the show?

{"text": "did flowers did what? Choices: 1: she stole a tree 2: she was on drugs 3: they wilted 4: they dried out 5: they died\nRationales: Now, let's interpret the choices: \n1. She stole a tree- this could be a valid answer, but stealing a tree doesn't necessarily have any impact on flowers.\n2. She was on drugs- this could also be a valid answer, as some drugs can affect plants. However, the question is specifically asking about her interaction with flowers, not other plants. \n3. They wilted- this is a common reaction to overwatering or exposure to high temperatures. However, wilting doesn't necessarily mean the plant has died, and it doesn't necessarily happen every time a person tried to grow flowers.\n4. They dried out- drying out is a common reaction to underwatering and cooler temperatures. In this context, it would be interpreted as wilted flowers dying.\n5. They died- this is the final answer. Every time she tried to grow flowers, they died.\nAnswer: 5: they died.\n\nInput: What do you use to carry documents and papers from one place to another? Choices: 2. computer 3. mobile phone or phone 4. tablet 5. laptop 6. flash drive\nRationales: Computers (Choice 2) are electronic devices that provide various functionalities including accessing and manipulating digital information. Laptops (Choice 5) are also electronic devices used for accessing and manipulating digital data; however, they tend to be more portable than desktop computers. Tablets (Choice 4) are portable, handheld devices that can be used for accessing and manipulation digital data, but are typically more limited in their functionality compared to laptops and computers. Flash drives (Choice 6) are small, portable storage devices that are used to store and transfer digital data from one location to another. However, flash drives are limited in their storage capacity compared to other devices such as laptops and computers, which can contain large amounts of digital data.\nAnswer: 6: flash drive.\n\nInput: How much does the t-shirt cost?

Moving on, the sentence that follows (Answer B.), suggests that they think they'll succeed, which doesn't make sense, so we can eliminate that choice \n 3. Next up is Answer C (III), which further suggests that they will succeed, which is the opposite of the previous sentence, so we can eliminate it as well \n 4. Answer D (IV) seems to make the most sense because it is the opposite of everything we have read so far; it is the most logical answer to the sentence \n 5. Answer E (V), however, does not make any sense, as it is a grammatical error \n 6.

Into your nose B. Inside of your ear C. Into your eyes D. Inevitable\nRationales:1. We must first interpret the meaning of the question. The phrase 'put something in your face' is often used figuratively to describe someone's aggressive behavior or attitude, such as in a heated argument or conflict.\n2. The literal place where one would put something, such as an object, in the face is inside the nose. However, the intended meaning of the question does not seem to align with this location.\n3. Now, we can consider each of the answer options that the question brings to us:\n(a) Into your nose (Answer: A.) This would be too literal an answer and is not relevant to the intended meaning of the phrase 'put something in someone's face'. (b) Inside of your ear (Answer: B.) The intended meaning of the phrase does not seem to align, as the sense of aggression or threat the phrase implied would not be conveyed in this location. (c) Into your eyes (Answer: C.) This is the most likely location as it is the target of the aggression or threats", "answer": " 5"}

Any food can be ordered for breakfast that meets the requirement.\n\n**Answer**: The answer is A: green grapes which can be eaten. \n\n**Input**: She did not buy any vegetables from the grocery store because he was broke.\n\n**Raionales**: The statement tells us to choose the best answer to the question. The best answer is the one that makes the most sense or aligns most with the context.\n\n**Answer:** The answer is B: he didn't have enough money to buy vegetables\n\n**Instructions**: Answer the following math question.\n\n**Demostration**: Input: Math is a subject where you learn about angles, which you can find in many places.\n\n**Ratios**: 1. The sentence tells us to understand \"what you learn about angles\". The answer has to do with angles (not height or width or length). 2. Now that we understand and have associated the words, we can interpret the possible answers: Angles are a part of mathematics. For this answer choice, we need to know more context from the rest of the question to understand what the person is learning about angles. 3. The following is an excerpt from the question. \"which you can find in many parts.\" The phrase \"which you can find\" tells us that we need to search for angles in some place or part. Therefore, we can exclude answer D( height, length, and width). 4.

{"text": "was ready she failed what? Choices: 1. A: grow fruit and vegetables 2. B: take vitamins regularly 3. C: plant the seeds herself 4. D: harvest the produce 5. E: care for the plants\nRationales: First, we understand the intended meaning by reading the question and considering the options in regard to the prompt. \n1. No one with a \"green thumb\" is struggling to grow fruit and vegetables, as it's generally a simple task for someone who has one. We can easily eliminate this option as a good fit.\n2. Taking vitamins regularly does not necessarily indicate success in growing plants, so we can eliminate it.\n3. Planting seeds does not suggest a person lacks a green thumb, so this option also can be ruled out.\n4. Harvesting is a step in the process after the plant has grown. It also does not represent the intention of the question.\n5. Choice E: care for the plant sounds like the right type of action for a person with a green thumb. Therefore, the best choice is E: care for the plats.\nAnswer: E; care for the plats\n\nInput: Where can you find a maple tree? Choices: \n1. A: North Woods\n2. B: Forest\n3. C: Park\n4. D: School yard\n5. E: Grove\nRationales: Before moving further, review the prompt to better understand the purpose of the question. \n1. The phrase \"find a maple tree\" can be interpreted as \"find and identify where maple trees are growing.\" Therefore, the first step is to determine which places maple trees may be found.\n2. Next, determine if the location is easily accessible. For example, if the location is in a forest in the middle of the desert, it would be very unlikely that anyone will be able to \"find a maple\" within the boundaries of this location.\n3. Finally, determine if the location makes sense for the answer. For example, a school's front yard might be an appropriate answer, while a store isn't.\n4. After considering these factors, it's possible that one can find many maple trees in the North Woods. The North Woods are very large wooded areas of land; therefore, numerous maple trees", "answer": " 75"}

Choices:  I: grow a flower II: grow a plant III: grow a fruit IV: grow vegetables V: grow a tree\nRationales: The answer should make sense in the context of the phrase, \"every time she thought she did.\" It should sound unexpected or incongruous. \n1. Grow a flower and grow a plant fit, but this person did not seem to have a green thumb, so they should not be able to grow such a thing. Therefore, III and IV (grow a plant and grow a vegetable) are eliminated. \n2. Option I: grow a flower is not incongruous, so we can eliminate that option from consideration.\n3. Grow a fruit does not fit the context, so option V is eliminated. \n4. Option II: grow a plant doesn't fit with what she tried to grow, so III is not the correct answer, either.\n5. Option IV: grow a vegetable is incongruous with what we know about the character's lack of a green thumb, so IV cannot be the correct answer. \n6.

This helps us determine the relevant information and clues needed to resolve the question.\n2. Use the context clues to identify the situation: a person doesn't have a green (plant) thumb and every time they think they have a flower coming up or trying to every time, they do something to it.\n3. Identify the most probable reasons for the actions. It's necessary to consider both possible actions and the context or motives related to those actions.\n4. Choices: A: watering it. In the context of the scenario, watering it would not be likely, since it's trying to grow. \nB: touching it. Touching the plant could indicate that the person is trying to encourage it to grow or fix a problem.\nC: speaking to it. Speaking to the plant would not be in a negative manner indicating \"throwing it away\"; instead, it could be a positive action related to encouragement.\nD: throwing it away. Throwing the plant away would indicate that the person is giving up on trying to nurture it or is frustrated with it not growing. \nE: moving it. Moving the plant could indicate relocating it to a better environment or to a place where it has a better chance at growing.\n5. Answer based on all the choices. Based on everything we have considered, the most apt answer choices are B and C, where the person was trying to encourage it or fix a problem, and speaking to it. \nTherefore, the correct choices are B and C: A. watering it is not relevant, D. throwing it away is not relevant, E. moving it is not relevant, which leaves us with B and C.\n\nAnswer:\nB.

{"text": "saw an improvement, a plant died, what was going wrong? Choices: 1. A: no water 2. B: too much sun 3. C: no flowers D: no weeds 4. E: insects\nRationales: Let's define the terms. A \"plant\" is defined as any living thing of the vegetable kingdom, including trees, mushrooms and grass. A \"green thumb\" is a metaphor for a person having a natural ability to grow anything well, typically plants. It represents the idea of being good at gardening. \n1. It's unlikely that there's no water. In fact, it is probably not an issue. 2. It's also unlikely that there's too much sun, as there's likely to be enough room to spread the plants, not close to a strong source of sunlight. 3. If there are no flowers, then it suggests that something is wrong with the plant itself and its ability to grow, which would be a reason why a green thumb isn't present. \n4. No-weeding means there are no weeds, which is an unlikely scenario as not-tending a garden would lead to the development of weeds. \n5. Finally, insects are typically not an issue for gardeners as they are usually taken care of. \n6. In conclusion, the answer is choice E: insects, as it makes the most logical sense. While other choices could apply in specific situations, overall insects are the most likely answer. \nAnswer: E: insects\n\nInput: I hope that she feels better quickly, she is really down and out.

The idea is that she makes changes to her plants but these changes aren't successful. \n1. We then have to select the most accurate words to represent the idea. Change (option D) is not the right word as it would suggest a gradual change.\n2. Change shape (option C) is an idea that might be closer to this concept but the same problem, gradual change.\n3. Then comes idea of wither (option B), which fits well with the context of the question, because it is the only correct option that implies gradual change.\n4. Change color (option E) refers to different colors rather than one specific color.\n5. Lose color (option E) would be a good choice because it means losing one particular color and not color change in general, but it is a more vague term.\n6. Therefore, our answer is B: Wither.

Choices:  A. dead tree B. a dying bush C. a dying plant D. dying leaves E. withered flowers\nRationales: Read the answer choices carefully, especially how they are phrased. We can eliminate three of the answer choices by doing so:\ni. Dying leaves (Choice D) and withered flowers (Choice E) are too literal, which can help us eliminate them. \nii. A dying plant (Choice B) may sound good as the correct answer, but it's too strong of a solution; we are being provided with a reason that explains her inability to cultivate plants, not that she has managed to grow one.\niii. A dying bush (Choice C) is an unrelated element, as we aren't being told that she has managed to plant or grow any plant at all.\nWe now only need to compare the remaining two answer choices: \ni. A dead tree (Choice A). This choice is too far removed from the specific elements being considered \"she sure didn't have\". It also doesn't account for any plant or plant-like substance.\nii. A green thumb (Choice F). The phrase \"she sure didn' garden\" has two parts, suggesting that she is either unable to, or has never been able to \"plant one.\" Hence, the answer must be related to cultivation of plants, not successful gardening.\nSince green thumb is not a common term used to describe successful gardening, it represents a logical fit.\nAnswer: C. a dying bush", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "planted a plant, it killed it. Choices:  A green fingerprint B: green house C: green eyes D: green plants E: green thumb\nRationales: There's a lot in here to work with, so let's break it down carefully: \n1. \"Green thumb\" (choice E) refers to a person skilled in gardening or having a knack for growing plants. \n2. The first two sentences are telling us that this person was not well versed in gardening and had an unfortunate history with plants. \n3. From this, we can infer that this person probably did not have a green thumb. \n4. \"Green fingerprint\" (choice A) refers to a thumbprint colored green, or a green mark or impression left by the thumb. It does not describe someone's skill at gardening, so it can be eliminated. \n5. \"Green house\" (choice B) refers to a place or environment, most commonly referring to a greenhouse, a structure typically used to cultivate plants or support plant growth. This option can be eliminated as well. \n6. \"Green eyes\" (choice C) does not refer to gardening, so can be discarded. \n7. \"Green plants,\" (choice D), also does not refer to garden skills, and can therefore be disregarded. \n\nNow we have narrowed it down to three options that do not mean \"green thumb,\" so E has become our only possible response. \n\nAnswer: E: green thumb\n\n![](2022-05-13-at-21-06-28-1.png)\n![](2018-05-28-at-05-30-49-1.png) \n\n### Extend:Write two more questions for today's discussion.\n\n### Extra Credit: What's the difference between a regular and a standard definition?\n\n### Extended Credit: Extra help with reading and comprehending the materials\n\n### Bonus Credit: What are the most common grammar problems faced by ESL learners?", "answer": " 180"}
{"text": "was a good gardener, it died!

We have to identify \"had a long, skinny\" as an untrue statement. \"Long\" means there is a long part, but \"skinny\" means there is a short one. Together, they cannot be \"long and skinny\" as these terms are opposites (one cannot be both thick and narrow).\n3. She may \"had a lot of sewing,\" but it has nothing to do with gardening.\n4. She may have \"had a little money\" related to garding, the problem is that this sentence is not clear since she had (or had not) any money and still died.\n5. She never had \"much money\" and she was \"a terrible gardener,\" but it has no relation to her \"green thumb.\"\n6. Finally, \"She sure didn' t have...\" and \"green thumb\" mean the same thing. They both describe a person who was a \"good gardener\" but was not.\n7. To summarize, A: \"had a lot of [money] and B: was a terrible gardener\" are not the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answers are C: \"had a long skim body\" and D: \"green thumb.\"\nAnswer: C & D: had a long skim body and green thumb", "answer": " 150"}

Each of the answer choices should relate to plants, gardening, or greenery and not be incompatible with the context of the sentence.\n2. \"D. Incorrectly\" is not directly related to plants.\n3. \"B. Not able to\" relates to a person who has difficulty at growing plants or maintaining plants, making it a plausable answer.\n4. \"C. Inappropriate\" relates to a behavior or conduct that is unsuitable for a certain situation or group.\n5. \"E. Unable to\" refers to the inability to perform an action or task, making it plausible.\n6. However, it should be noted that there is a possibility that this person could have a green thumb (A), so the answer cannot be definitively \"B. Not able\" or \"E. Unable to\".\n7.

A \"suitcase\" would typically be a large bag or box typically used for travel, which is not appropriate for the context here.\n2. A \"backpack\" is a bag typically used for carrying items while travelling, making it a plausbile choice.\n3. A \"purse\" is small, portable bag typically used for carrying personal items.\n4. A briefcase is a portable, larger bag with multiple compartments, making it plausable.\n5. A carry on bag is a bag typically used that can be taken on a person\u2019s person while travelling.\n6.

Choices E: the plant grew\nRationales: The correct answer is A. The question asks us the outcome of the plant growing. She either has a green thumb or she doesn't, meaning when she thinks she has plant grown the outcome will either be the plant dying or the plant growing. If the plant did grow, it must have been a result of her having a green thumb. However, the green thumb was never mentioned in the choice, meaning we can eliminate it.

We can eliminate Choices 2 and Choice 9. \nThe bear could eat squirrels, fish, deer, vegetables, grasshoppers, etc. as a main course. The questions asks us what the main course is of the bear. 3.

{"text": "had a new idea how to do something, she would just make a mess. Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales: Let's get started with understanding the phrases \"make a mess\", and \"didn't have a green  thumb\", which both suggest a negative experience.\n\n1. From the question, it is clear that the intention is to convey frustration and a lack of success.\n2. We then examine each choice:\n    * A: She sure didn' t have a green thumb - This suggests that she doesn't have the skills necessary to garden. It fits the intended connotation, that her idea would just make a mess because she lacks the ability to garden well.\n    * B: every time she thought she  had a new idea how  to do something - This confirms her intention to do something new, as the idea will be a new concept or method of completing the task.\n    * C: She sure didn'  make a mess - This does not accurately reflect the intended inference. It suggests that \"she sure\", meaning \"without doubt\", has a new idea, but doesn't make a mess.\n    * D: how did she know it would work? She sure didn' t - This also doesn't fit the intended inference. It's saying that she doesn't know how to successfully accomplish the task, so it lacks the frustration found in the question.\n    * E: every time, she thought she  knew how to do something - This could be true if the new idea is just an adjustment or small change, but it doesn't convey her intent to completely change the usual method, which could lead to more errors and a mess.\n    Finally, considering all of the options, D is the most accurate. It implies that she didn't know how to make her ideas work without making a mess, giving the intended inference of trying and failing while not making the intended connotation (i.e. mess).\n    \nAnswer: D: how did she  know it would work?

{"text": "knew how to make things better, the outcome failed, how did she feel about it? Choices:  B: calm  C: happy  D: angry  A: content  E: confident\nRationales: The first step is to determine the feeling expressed in the question. The key words are \"better\" and \"every time\", which imply that she is making numerous attempts to improve the situation and each outcome is failing. \nThe key words \"how did she feel about it\" further indicate that she may have experienced a certain emotion due to the repeated failures. \nTo interpret the answer choices, consider the actions of a person with each feeling. For instance, a person who is upset or angry after each attempt to better the situation would not be content or calm. The same applies to all the other feelings. The only exception is confident. Although a person who is confident may make mistakes, they have the conviction that they are right and will usually not be upset or disappointed by failure. \nThis leads to the conclusion that the correct answer is D.\nAnswer: D. angry\n\nInput: My friend was going to help me find a ride, but I could not wait. I could help him later. Which one is right? Choices:  C: 2nd B: 3rd A: 4th E: 1st  D: 5th\nRationales: First, understand the question, then interpret the answer choices. \n1. The key words in the question are \u201cI could not wait.\u201d This implies that there is a time constraint, such as a schedule or deadline, that must be followed or there may be consequences. This may imply that one of the choices is correct. \n2. Interpret the answer choices: 1st: The 1st answer choice is related to \"find a ride,\" which could refer to a vehicle or transportation method, and \"later\" refers to the time after the \"ride\" has been found. So, we can conclude that the 1st choice involves finding a ride and then helping someone later. \n3. 2nd: The 2nd answer choice involves \"my friend,\" which may refer to a close one, such as a partner, friend, or family member, and \"help me,\" which implies that the friend is asked for help. So, the 2nd choice refers to helping a friend. \n4", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": "made a flower grow, what happened? Choices:  Talked A: died B: sprouted C: budged D: fell off E: dried up\nRationales: First, it's crucial to understand the words: \"She sure didn't have (the ability) to grow a green thumb.\" The use of \"not\" (no) and \"didn't\" indicate that this person did not have the ability to do the thing described (\"grow a green thumb\").\n1. Let's identify each option: C: budged is a verb that means \"to begin a new or different activity or enterprise.\" While \"budging\" could be interpreted as \"sprouting,\" it's not the most common meaning.\n2. D: fell off is an inappropriate response as it is unlikely that someone would lose or drop a flower.\n3. E: dried up is an incorrect response because \"dried up\" means \"completely and permanently dried/lack of moisture,\" which does not fit the context.\n4. Option: A: died is a viable response because the phrase \"thought she made a flower grow\" would imply that the person had attempted to grow a flower successfully, but unfortunately the flower did not survive.\n5. Option: B: sprouted is not likely since the sentence still implies that she tried to grow a flower but was unsuccessful.\n6.

The phrase \"something\" leaves space for ambiguity, but looking at the description below gives us clues. \"Her flowers\" is not a suitable outcome, as that suggests success. \"The wrong plant\" is a possibility but does not fit the given description. \"A grass type vegetable\" would not produce flowers, unless it's a cross-pollination, so this is also unlikely. Option #1 fits best with the provided description: \"something\" happened when she thought she was planting a flower.

Choices:  a. The bathroom b. The housekeeper c. The kitchen d. Both the bathroom and the kitchen e. Neither the bathroom nor the kitchen\nRationales: There are three possible answers. By starting with the first part of the sentence, we can eliminate half of these three: the kitchen, the housekeeper, and the bathroom. The statement \"while the housekeeper is out...\" means that the housekeeper is away, and this helps us narrow our search to the remaining two. One, the bathroom and two, the kitchen. As they both need cleaning at the same time, they will only have them in common if the housekeeper is out of the bathroom and the housekeeper needs to be out of the kitchen. Therefore, the answer can't be both the bathroom and the bed, and answer C, the kitchen is not an appropriate answer, as this isn't what is in common while the two items are being cleaned. The answer to this question is: answer D, the kitchen. As the housekeeper is out, and the owner is in, they both need to vacate the kitchen in order to clean it.\nAnswer: D, The kitchen.\n\nInput: What did he put in the bowl before he sat down at the table?

Choice E, \"fruit\": this can be a vegetable but is more specifically a fruit that grows on trees.\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice E: fruit.\nAnswer: E fruits", "answer": " 6400"}
{"text": "she's had what? Choices: \nA: a potted plant B: a garden C: the water D: the idea E: the house\nRationales: Understanding the question: She doesn't have a green (or \"great\") thumb means she's not good at gardening or managing plants. \nEliminating the choices: Choices A, B, C and D can be eliminated because they all have a logical meaning regarding being a competent plant manager, and as we have been told that she's not good, they can't be correct. \nFinal: The answer must have a logical meaning that directly describes why she doesn't have a good plant manager, so we consider D: the idea. This means she didn't understand the basics of making plants grow and survive, which makes sense since she didn't have a good \"green thumb.\" It also explains why she failed in managing plants at all times, which is what the sentence \"every time she thought she could do plant managing she failed\" is trying to convey.

{"text": "was doing good she was doing what? Choices: 1: killing the flowers 2: watering them 3: weeding the ground 4: feeding the plant 5: using pesticides\nRationales: The first step is to carefully read and understand the question. The sentence contains three key components: a person who is attempting to tend or care for flowers, an action they take, and a result or outcome of this action.\nStep 2: Now break down the question by examining the possible choices and their relevance to the situation being described. We can eliminate 5: using pest kills or using pesticides immediately because it is an improper application of the word \"were\" in the question. This choice would not make sense if we were to replace \"was\" with \"are\", because killing would require that the pesticides were already present or that the person was trying to do this when the pesticide could kill the plant. Similarly and since the person could not weed and kill at the same time, we can eliminate 4: feeding and killing.\nStep 3: With that in mind, we can narrow down the list of choices to the following:\nStep 4: Let's now analyse each choice:\nStep 5: For the first 4: watering, weeding, feeding, and using pesticides we can eliminate all of them, as watering is a process and weeding, feeding and pesticides are means for caring or killing for example.\nStep 6: For choice 5: killing we can ask ourselves: was it a mistake or a purposeful/deliberate act to kill the plant? If the answer is no, we can eliminate killing because it is not an actual action the person may commit or a way of performing the actual action.\nStep 7: Moving further on, for the last choice, we can ask what it means to weed a plant. Weeding is the action of removing unwanted plants, flowers, or seeds.\nWith this information, we can come to a list of possible answers:\nStep 9: Based on the remaining choices, feeding is an improper application as it may kill the plant. Similarly, using pesticides could be a purposeful or voluntary means to kill the plant, a possibility supported by the lack of a \"may,\" which implies that the use of p", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "planted seeds and took care of them, they all grew into which vegetables? Choices: 1. A: corn 2. B: potatoes 3. C: carrots 4. D: kale 5. E: tomatoes\nRationales: There are five options. The question asks which of these five vegetable options are a result of her planting them.\n1. Corn is an option, however it will likely sprout from corn seeds and not just in her backyard. \n2. Potatoes are also an option but it is not specified what area they are planted in nor is potato growing the intention of the statement. \n3. Carrots, are an option, however the statement doesn\u2019t specify if the carrots would grow if she planted a seeds and took care them. She could have neglected to water or tend to them. \n4. Kale is an option however it will likely sprouts from kale seeds and not from seeds that she was trying to grow. \n5. Tomatoes are an option, however it does not specify if she has a green thumb in reference to tomatoes. \nTherefore, answer is A: corn.\nAnswer: A : corn\n\nInput: In a classroom, what does a teacher do to a student who is being disruptive during class?

{"text": "was killing a flower, she was actually giving it life!\nRationales: The intended answer is a modification of the existing text which is given at the start of the instruction to be modified. \nFirst, try to figure out what is already there in the instruction. In the context of the question, the following statements are known:\n```\nShe\nSure\nA\nGiving\nLife\n```\nHere, notice the words are not completely independent. They form 6 statements. It seems to talk about a person who has a bad relationship or interaction with plants.\n\nNow, read the given instruction carefully and look for the gaps that allow us to fill in all the sentences.\n\n1) She (Sure A) [What the sentence says: She did not have a green thumb]\n\n2) Didn't (Giving Life) [It says: she thought she was killing the plant; she was giving the plant life.]\n\nAnd now we try to fill in all those gaps\n```\nShe sure didn't have [A (Sure)] a green thumb. Every time she thought she [thought she (Didn't)] was giving life [giving life (Giving Life)] to the flower.\n```\nAfter that, we go through each of the answers and see if they fit this sentence.\n\n```\nShe sure did [She Sure DID] have [Have (A)] a green thumb.

{"text": "was going to try her hand, she picked up what was ailing her? Choices: \nA: yellow B: brown C: white D: dirt E: plant\nRationales: First, understand the question in depth. The phrase \"her hand\" refers to a literal hand and is meant to be used.\nThe first step is to understand each option. \nOption A: yellow is not correct. The phrase \"every time she thought she was\u2026\" suggests an expectation, and this is not what one would see from the color \"yellow.\"\nOption B: brown. While it's possible for \"brown to represent green,\" this can be difficult to discern.\nOption C: white. This could be accurate, as many plants use a white pigment called \"chlorophyll\" which is the primary source of energy for photosynthesis.\nOption D: dirt. This should be excluded. If someone had a \"green thumb,\" she would likely not be picking up dirt, as this wouldn't be a characteristic associated with healthy, green growth.\nOption E: plants. There is a chance that this description may fit since picking up plants is the most likely outcome of gardening, and plants can be various colors.\nThe best answer choice is C: white.  The phrase \"ailing her\" implies that a problem is occurring, so it makes sense that the color associated with said problem should be excluded.\nAlso, if the person had \"a green thumb,\" it's likely that the plants picked up wouldn't be diseased, implying that this would be a healthy color.\nOption C:  white is the best answer choice. \nAnswer: C: White", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "could do gardening she picked which? Choices: A: rose B: lilac C: geranium D: dandelions E: tomatoes\nRationales: The first step is to consider the question. It asks which flower someone might not be able to grow in a garden, suggesting that a person has tried and failed to grow this flower before.\n1. Every time she thought she could grow geraniums: this phrase suggests that she has tried multiple times to grow geraniums without success - geraniums can be sensitive to soil conditions.\n2. In contrast, every time she thought I could grow roses: this phrase implies that she was able to successfully grow roses before - roses are generally easier to grow than geraniums.\n3. Dandelions - this flower isn't often grown in gardens because it's considered a weed.\n4. Lily of the valley - sometimes the plants struggle to survive a winter in cold climates.\n5. Tomatos - these are plants that rely on pollination, so someone would have to make sure to have the correct type of insects in their garden in order to grow tomatoes.\n6. In conclusion, the answer is B, geraniums not being able to grow every time she thought she should grow those. \nAnswer: B: geraniums\n\nInput: What are you going to do after a vacation? Choices:  a: rest b: continue c: stay d: travel e: visit\nRationales: First, we need to understand what the question asks. It implies that we have just come back from a vacation and are considering our next steps, either immediately following the vacation or sometime in the near future.\n1. Travel is usually associated with vacations. Therefore, the vacation could have ended only a few hours ago or a few months ago. Either way, there would need to be \"something\" other than travel after the vacation.\n2. We need to consider each option: \na: rest is something a person would typically do after traveling, and not after returning from a vacation.\nb: continue is an option that would make sense after a long journey. However, unless a long journey had been made before starting the vacation, it doesn't seem likely that continuing the journey would be the next step after a vacation.\nc: stay", "answer": " 4500"}

D: To be on a tour is to be in charge of others and guide them. E: To be on the highway is to be in a vehicle on roads.\nRationales\n\nA: On a boat and in the water at a distant from land doesn't make sense.\n\nC: To be on a holiday or vacation with other people may be similar to cruise.\n\nD: To be on a journey, a tour, on the move, in charge of others and to guide them seems to be a different thing.\n\nIt makes sense for the answer to be C: to be on a holiday.\nIt's not a tour or a journey.\n\nRationale\n\nA: To be on a car can mean driving a car, not riding in one.\n\nB: This answer might make sense in certain contexts, but not the entire context.\n\nC: Yes. It is true that a boat is a vehicle in water, but it's still not a good choice because on a cruise, you don't take a boat.

{"text": "had something coming to her what did she do? Choices: 1. A: throw dirt 2. A: dig in the garden 3. A: water plants 4. A: take a day off\nRationales: The question asks us to determine an unusual reaction when things don't come to the person, as she has a \"green thumb.\" It's important to focus on the word \"reaction\" and consider how one might respond if things don't come their way (if they lack a \"green thumb\", in your analogy). \nIn this case, the phrase \"thought she had something coming to\" can be interpreted as if she thought things were going her way but ultimately didn't receive it. \nSo, the answer should be a likely reaction that could occur when things don't work out. A) throwing dirt is a strange reaction as it doesn't relate to a plant. \nB) digging in the garden is another possibility, but there doesn't seem to be any specific action or event to dig in the garden for. C) watering plants can be done after something is received or is growing, not necessarily before something is due. \nD) taking a day off has an unusual association with the question, which makes it not a good match. This leaves us with A) taking a day off, which is quite common among those who are not successful at something. This is a possible, ordinary consequence of experiencing disappointment.\nAnswer: A) taking a day to rest\n\nInput: Which job is probably not on the list of things to do? Choices: a) buy a house b) get an education c) get married d) buy a car e) have children\nRationales: a) The question asks what is probably not on the \"list of things to do.\" Buying a house typically has to do with real estate, so it's not relevant here.\nb) The phrase \"get an education\" is not necessarily linked to a list of things to do at a specific time. It is also not in the context of getting a job. Therefore, B) \"get an education\" does not provide an answer to the question.\nc) \"Get married\" is a likely answer as it's not directly related to getting a job, but rather to personal life.

{"text": "was watering it. Choices:  A green thumb is when the gardener knows the exact amount of water their plants need at the time it's being watered. It requires a great deal of knowledge in plant biology and maintenance techniques.\nRationales: To start analyzing the options, the main idea is \"Green Thumb\". Since it's a figure of speech, we can infer it's not a literal phrase. \"Green\" is an inaccurate color for a thumb so \"green thumb\" doesn't make sense. Instead, we must think of a thumb that would be green. A thumb with enough dirt can be green and can mean \"not being great at something.\" To make this phrase more accurate, we can remove \"not being\" from the sentence. \"A green thumb\" means to have a good thumb at taking care of a garden. The plants could be \"watered\" a lot in just a small amount of time. The plant only needs a small amount of water so she gives much more to the plant. She thinks she is watering the plant but she is not. She does not have a green thumb and she ends up killing the plant.  The phrase \"every time she thought she was...\" confirms the second option \"watering the plant.\"\nAnswer: B: Watering the Plant \n\nInput: A woman should be a lady, what would be appropriate dress for a day out? What is a lady? Choices: 1: An attractive, sophisticated and gentle personality, but also a smart, ambitious and educated.\nRationales The correct answer for this question is '1'.

{"text": "had a new idea for how to plant something she didn't what? Choices:  B: water it  C: know what went wrong  D: wait to see what happens  E: do research\nRationales: First, it's important to understand the context of the sentence, \"She sure didn't have green thumb.\" This suggests that the person is not a skilled gardener or someone who typically has good luck with plants.\n2. Let's look at the choices: B: water it, C: know what went, D: wait to see, E: do research.\n3. \"Water it\" refers to watering plants. It is essential for plants to be watered, but it does not necessarily indicate that a person has a green thumb.\n4. \"Know what went\" refers to knowing what happened and what could have gone wrong, but it's the wrong choice because it assumes a person knows what happened.\n5. \"Wait to see\" implies that the person is not sure yet or is waiting to see whether the plant survives, which is not the same as having a green thumb.\n6. \"Do research\" refers to gathering information and learning about different factors that could affect a plant's growth, which is a common practice for people with green thumbs. However, \"do research\" is a broader choice, not specifically related to having a green thumb. \n7. Therefore, considering the context and the meaning of the sentence, the best choice is E: do research since this could be considered part of having a green thumb. This choice fits best with the context of the sentence.\nAnswer: E; do research\n\nInput: What do farmers often use to store a seeds?

{"text": "found a way to fix it, the plant died. Choices: A: tree B: garden mold C: garden fungus D: houseplant E: carrot\nRationales: The sentence describes a situation where the subject, who believed they were able to fix a garden plant, ends up with it dying. The question asks us what type of tree would she have if she had succeeded.\n1. To answer this, consider each option. \n2. Option A: tree. Although plants do not refer to a type of tree, it could be a type of tree planted in the garden. \n3. However, we can rule out A as the subject had no success with their garden plant.\n4. Now considering option B: garden mold. This is not a tree, and it doesn't work since the subject supposedly failed at finding a solution for their garden plant. \n5. Option B: garden fungus. Again, this is not a tree, as the mold is caused by fungus, so it cannot be a type of tree that the subject found.\n6. Option C: houseplant. This is similar to the above option and is also not a tree. \n7. Option D: carrot. This is a type of tree, so it's the correct answer. \n8.

Best friend (B) generally has more money compared to others in their circle, including siblings and grandparents, but this is not necessarily in terms of birthday money because the subject gives their portion as a gift according to the question, which would make the best friend an indirect recipient, so B: best friend cannot be the correct option. \n3.

{"text": "had it planted, it died? Choices: A: rose B: garden C: pot D: weed E: soil\nRationales: The first step is to analyze the choices: 1. A: rose. Rose does not really fit the definition of a plant which dies when she thought she had it in a garden.\n2. B: Garden. Garden does not really fit the choice as well either because they used the same term \"planted\" as it's a place one plants many things like roses or vegetables which would die.\n3. C: pot. Pot is a container, and while it can be used to plant a plant, that doesn't mean she has success in each time she thinks she plants in the pot.\n4. D: Weed. Weed has to do with removing unwanted plants from one's garden. Although weed can be considered a plant, it does not represent success in planting.\n5. E: Weeds.

Choices:  A. buy groceries  B. go out to eat  C. stay inside the home  D. spend the entire day  E. prepare the dishes\nRationales: First, we analyze the choices to understand where the kids are headed.\n1. A: buy groceries. Groceries are usually purchased for eating at a restaurant or, at home.\n2. B, go out to eat. Eating at a restaurant generally requires leaving the house and driving to a local establishment.\n3. C. stay inside the house, This sounds like the kids are not necessarily going out anywhere. Staying home may not mean preparing to walk elsewhere.\n4. D, spend the entire day. Staying home to spend the entire day is not the only choice; the kids can leave at any time, so this choice is not a necessity.\n5. E, get ready to leave.

{"text": "had a garden she would just kill what she planted Choices: A: die B: grow C: wither D: flourish E: wilt\nRationales: First, try to understand what's being asked. \nSecond, we must determine the characteristics of a green thumb. This would not necessarily be the ability to grow plants, since anyone can do that with enough time and resources. Instead, it would be the ability to nurture and care for plants, as a green thumb will encourage growth and healthy development.\nThe answer choices are now analyzed one by one:\nA: die is an indication of an inability to grow or thrive, which does not align with the definition of a green thumb.\nB: grow does describe how growth can happen, but this would not specifically address the characteristics of a green, rather a growing, thumb. \nC: wither is synonymous with the opposite characteristic of a green thumb, in that it would describe an inability to thrive and grow. \nD: flourish can indicate the ability to grow and thrive, which is in the right direction; however, not every action or result has to involve flourishing, just as something may grow without necessarily flourishing. \nE: wilt is the opposite of flourishing, and can be used in place of wither.\nConsidering all the option as a whole, A: die, B: grow, C: wither, and D: flourish fail to accurately represent the characteristics of a green - growing thumb.\nE: wilt - however - does accurately represent this characteristic; it clearly indicates a plant that is wilting, likely due to a lack of care or other factors.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: wilt.\nAnswer: E, wilt means a plant that is wilter and not good for growth.\n\nInput: She has no place to put her book now, which does not mean she no longer has a book.

{"text": "had planted it, she forgot. Choices:  A. Drywall B. Wasp and spider web C. Plants D. Dead leaf E. Plywood\nRationales: The question asks us to identify what the speaker thinks of someone's planting skills. They're obviously not impressed, as they use the phrase \"She sure didn't have green thumb\". \nThe speaker is making a generalization about someone's lack of knowledge or skill in planting. They use the phrase \"every time she thought she had\" to emphasize how often her planting efforts failed.\nConsidering the answer choices: \n1. \"Drywall\" is an inappropriate answer choice. \n2. \"Wasp and spider web\" is also unlikely since it doesn't refer to planting or gardening in a literal way.\n3. \"Plants\" can refer to planting, but it's an overly general term that doesn't specifically refer to the skill in question.\n4. \"Dead leaf\" is a specific type of plant, but it doesn't necessarily mean \"she couldn't properly plant a plant\"; it simply refers to a particular type of plant.\n5. \"Plywood\" is an option that refers directly to a skill in gardening, but they wouldn't say \"She never had a green thumb, even when planting plywood.\"\n6. So what's left? It has to do with how the person plans and cares for their plants. And, the answer to that is Choice C: dead plants.

The phrase \"she sure didn't have ______ thumb\" is a way of saying she was not successful at a specific activity. In this case, she was supposed to be a gardener, so the appropriate activities are those related to plants.  \n2. The phrase \"_____ would die,\" is an expression for things that occur repeatedly, and in this case, it refers to plants that were supposedly made better by this person.  \n3. We can eliminate options that are inapplicable, irrelevant, or do not occur repeatedly or are not related to the activity. \n4. A. grow. This is a common gardening activity, but it represents growth and not plant improvement, so eliminate this option.  \n5. B. sprout. Not only is \"sprout\" not repeated or related to improvement in the phrase mentioned (it's the opposite of improvement), it is irrelevant. The plants don't have to sprout or are not related to how she thinks they should be improved, so this choice does not fit.  \n6. C. grow. Same reasoning as B. \"Growing\" and \"sprouting\" are relevant to the activity, but do not take into account how the plants look or behave, so these options also do not fit.  \n7. D. bloom.

{"text": "grow something her thumbs turn what? Choices:  green, red, water, brown, yellow\nRationales: The question asks us to answer a metaphorical question about the color of a person's thumbs. Since it talks about a thumb and uses the phrase \"grow something\", the best answer is a verb that would be used in a situation of growth. 1. She is sure that her lack of success with growing things is related to her green fingers. 2. Since there is no evidence to support this being the case, her thumbs turn brown every time she tries to grow something. 3. She has a green thumb and turns her thumbs green every time she grows something. 4. She plants things and has a green thumb. 5. She is sure that she turns her thumbs green, every time she has a green thumb.\nAnswer: 5. She is suure that she turns her thumb green every time she has a good, positive influence in her life. So, the correct answer is Her thumbs turn green.\n\nInput: When he is in a car he always has a hard time understanding what's going on with the cars around him, when is in a store you're more likely to see him do what?

{"text": "had a good plan it failed, which part of the plan was it? Choice: A: green B: good C: plan D: failed E: failed plan\nRationales: The key to solving this question is to understand the meaning of the word \"thought\" in the sentence \"Her plan failed every time she thought it was a good plan.\"\nIt implies that her plan wasn't successful because she didn't have a good understanding of how it would work. She might have had a specific idea or goal in mind, but lacked the skills or knowledge to execute it.\nTherefore, we should focus on the area of her plan that was not effective, which could be any of the following: 'the green,' 'the good,' 'the plan,' 'the failed,' or 'the failed plan.'\n'Green' refers to the success or failure of a person's plan, and it is unlikely that it would fail every time she thought her plan was a good idea.\n'Good' refers to the quality or merit of a person's work, and this could be a reason for the failure of a plan, but it would not necessarily be the only reason.\n'Plan' refers to the specific strategy or course of action that a person follows to achieve a goal, and it is likely that if her plan failed every time, there was an issue with the plan itself.\n'Failed' refers to the completion or success of a person's task or project, and this does not necessarily indicate that the whole plan failed.\nFor example, if she had a plan to plant flowers, but the plan failed because she didn't water them regularly, it's likely that the entire plan would not have failed simply due to the flowers dying.\nFinally, 'failed plan' refers to a specific strategy or course of actions that a person follows to accomplish a goal, and if her plan failed every single time she thought it was good, it's likely rooted in the plan itself.\nWe don't know what part of 'Green', 'Good', 'Plan', 'Failed' or 'Failed Plan' the author is referring to, and that would require the use of context clues.\nTherefore, it's possible that the answer is one of these but it's more likely that the author is referring to 'Plan' or 'Failed Plan.\nAnswer: A) Plan", "answer": " 30"}

We can start by crossing out all the answers that don't describe the woman. We know the woman has a green thumb since she keeps winning the plant.\n\nSecondly, we can cross out the incorrect answers since they either do not match the descriptive words given or do not make sense given to the context.\n\nThe woman is sure something based on her history of losing the plant.\n\nFrom the choices, it seems she has an either green, or red thumb. From the options, it seems that her thumb might be one of an array of colors and/or have a specific color. \n\nHowever, the last words we are given are: \"thought she was winning.\" In order to be sure she thought she was winning, she either needs to have won the plant many times in the past before, or think she had before she has. It is unlikely the latter as that was specifically told to us. Therefore, it seems that her prior history of winning has convinced her that she is. Her being sure means she is confident in winning again.\n\nConsidering her positive confidence in plant, it's unlikely that she loses. Also, she has no experience or winning which makes it even harder for her to win.

This statement is true.\nOption B: B. This statement is false, because a green thumb is described as someone who has natural aptitude in gardening, or maintaining things grown in a garden. The situation described indicates that she has no aptitude in gardening.\nOption C: C.

The phrase refers to a person's inability to grow plants, which implies that the person may be giving plants too much water.\n2. We look at each option:\n3. Watering. The option \"watering\" is correct because a person who constantly gives too much water to plants would be seen as an unskilled gardener and may not be able to grow plants.\n4. Happy. The option \"happy\" does not suit the meaning and does not relate to the context of the question.\n5. Brown. The option \"brown\" is incorrect because brown plant leaves do not always mean an inability to grow plants and may have other causes.\n6. Bright. The option \"bright\" also doesn't indicate an inability to grow, so it's not the right answer.\n7. Dog. The option \"dog\" isn't related to the context of the problem, so it can be eliminated.\n8.

White thumb (choice B): This is not an apt fit, as the person hasn't even attempted to water their plants and it says that they \"don't have a green.\"\n2. Cactus (choice E): Again, not applicable as the person in the joke doesn't seem like a good candidate for being a cactus gardener.\n3. Patch (choice C): The phrase \"every time she thought\" suggests it isn't just planting that's occurring. There was likely a period of time where they thought it was possible for the plant to survive for which they attempted and failed to care for it. The situation seems to be fairly consistent and recurring.\n4. Green thumb (choice A): This is not applicable, as the person has a \"green\" in that they've successfully managed to kill some plants without ever trying.\n5.

We should find the name of the person, who probably will have a green thumb. \nThan find the noun following the phrase \"every time she thought\" - it might be a verb like \"thought\", but in this case \"could grow\" is the verb following the phrase. \nNow we have to find the words \"grow\" or \"growing\". Those words might have different form like gerund \"growing\".  We found \"grow\" so we should look for the words growing and growing up, and it can occur after the word \"she\" and can be before the word \"wouldnt\".

{"text": "planted grass she instead planted what? Choices: \nA: a weed B: a rose plant C: bush D: herbs E: a rose\nRationales: This question asks us to determine what type of plant a person keeps misidentifying or mistaking for grass. 1.  First, we identify the key phrasing we want to focus on: \"every time she thought she plant...\" Since green thumb refers to a \"green\" color, we can eliminate weeded from the list of options. 2. Next, we think about the options again and consider whether it is likely that the person would confuse a weed or rose plant for grass. Since a green thumb is typically associated with gardening success and a person with this skill should be able to differentiate types of gardening plants, it makes sense that they would easily recognize the difference between a weed and a rose plant, so this option can be discarded as well. 3. So, only three remaining options are relevant: a bush, herbs, and a rose. Thinking about the options again and considering that the correct answer should be something that is commonly mistaken for grass, it is more likely that a bush or herbs would be misidentified instead of a rose. In fact, it is more likely to find two different types of plants in a garden that are both mistaken to be grass and a rose. 4. Therefore, the best option is A: a weed. 5. It makes the most sense for someone to misidentify something that looks similar to grass, and a common weed is more likely than a rose plant, bush, or herbs to be mistaken for grass, as the other options can be placed in gardens, but it is not likely that someone would confuse a rose with grass, since there are no roses with a greenish color. Hence, A: a weed is the correct choice. \nAnswer: A: a weed\n\nOutput: A: a weedy lawn, they would try to find the plants that were there before when they first bought the house and removed them\n\nInput: Who is a person most likely looking to pay at the market?

{"text": "planted a flower, she planted what? Choices: 1) A: weeds 2) B: bushes 3) C: carrots 4) D: apples 5) E: daisies\nRationales: First, we take a step back and understand the question. The sentence implies we're looking for an item that could have been planted in place of the flower every time she meant to plant a flower.\nTherefore, the answer can't be something that wasn't supposed to be there.\nNext, we analyze the answer choices to determine which ones fit the question. \nStarting with choice 1: \"weeds\". This can't be the answer because it's supposed to be replaced by a flower, which is not the same thing as a weed.\nNext, taking a look at choice 2: \"bushes\". We know this answer can't be the correct one as we said that it can't be any of the answer choices. However, what might seem like a non-answer could actually be the correct answer if we put it in different context. For instance, if we were talking about how someone had a green thumb for growing beautiful bushes in their garden instead of weeds, then bushes would be the perfect answer. \nTo continue, choice 3: \"carrots\". This is also not the correct answer since it can't be what we're looking for.\nNext, taking into consideration choice 4: \"Apples\". It can be a possibility depending on the context, as we can imagine someone planted apples thinking it was a flower and then realized it was an apple.\nBut for now, let's move on to choice 5: \"daisies\". This is the best answer as it fits in all the previous scenarios where we said the answer was either a weed, a bush, or an apple.\nBy looking at all the answer choices, we can confirm that \"daisies\" is the correct answer to this question. \nFinally, answer choice 5: \"Daisies.\"\nAnswer: D: Daisies.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary:\n\n* Reading the instructions and understanding the question are the first steps in answering an SAT Passage.\n* Use eliminations to narrow down the list of options for each clue.

Choices:  a. Send an email b. Speaking with them c. A video call d. Send them a snail mail e. Leave a voicemail \nRationales: Now, consider each of the choices, starting with Choice A: Email. It's the most logical choice, as sending an email is the quickest way to get in touch with someone, regardless of their profession. Emails are also usually viewed instantly, which is helpful in some situations.\n3. Choice B: Speaking with them - this could be done via phone, but also via an in-person meeting. But neither of those options is mentioned in the question, so this isn't a suitable response.\n4. Choice C: video call - this is a remote communication method between people that allows them to see each other and interact in real-time. However, it's not mentioned in the question, either.\n5. Choice D: snail mail. Although snail mail is slower than email and less convenient, it is a suitable option if someone wants to communicate with a specific person. \n6. Choice E Voicemail. This is an automated message system that someone can record and leave as a message for another person. It's certainly a feasible way to get in touch, but isn't necessarily preferred or convenient. \n7.

{"text": "had a plan she tried and failed. Choices:  A. Squash B. Mushroom C. Carrot D. Tomato E. Onion\nRationales: The key is to identify why the person didn't have success with their plan. The answer should be something to do with the vegetable plan, not a separate aspect of the vegetable cultivation process. \nEach option below requires the reader to make a separate assumption about which is the actual item for which a plan was attempted. \na.Squash: The only choice that has nothing to do with a plan. Squash, also known as pumpkin, is a vegetable that takes a long time to grow and can be quite prone to insect and disease problems. The growth cycle for most varieties is six to nine months, so a plan without a successful outcome would imply multiple failures.\nb. Mushroom: This is a fungus, not a vegetable. \nc. Carrot: Carrots require well-drained soil and plenty of organic matter to thrive. They're also relatively sensitive to soil conditions. A person who doesn't have a green, or healthy, thumb might not be the best person to grow carrots. \nd. Tomato: Tomatoes are susceptible to many common plant diseases. If a person doesn't know how to identify and solve these problems, they would probably have difficulty growing tomatoes.\ne.

{"text": "watered the grass she was always getting a white dye. Choices:  A : green B: brown C: black D : blue E: yellow\nRationales: First, understand the question and the key words. In this case, the phrase \"watered the grass\" means she was trying to make the grass greener, with green being the desired result or color. \nThe words \"thought she watered\" refer to her attempt to make the grass greeneer, with green referring the desired outcome.\nSecond, consider each of the possible answer choices, and their degree of plausibility.\nChoice A: Green. This choice is unlikely, as white is almost always the opposite of green. The phrase \"with every time\" suggests a regular pattern, and green is rarely if ever the result.\nChoice B: Brown. Brown isn't exactly the opposite of green, but it's fairly close and could be considered a \"darker\" version of green.\nChoice C: Black. This is a fairly plausible answer given the phrase \"watered\". The color black may be associated with something that has been drenched and darkened by water or other liquids.\nChoice D: Blue. Again, the opposite of green is not blue but rather black. While blue is not the opposite of green, it's not unlikely either.\nChoice E: Yellow. This is also a possible answer, as it's not the typical opposite of green but it's not unlikely as sometimes green shades can be a light yellow.\nIn conclusion, among the given choices, option C: Black is the most likely answer because it's closer to the color green than any other.\n(Rationale: As explained before, the phrase \"thought she watereed\" is a way of saying the woman tried to water the grass, so this question is not asking about a direct result but rather is asked as part of a riddle or a puzzle.

{"text": "has something to grow a plant in the yard, what happened? Choices:  C: plants died A: plants grew B: plants flourished D: plants grew out of control E: nothing grows\nRationales: The main clue that this is a grammar question is the usage of \"every time she thought she has.\" Since the sentence doesn't use the correct form \"every time she thinks she has,\" the phrase is simply incorrect and we can eliminate it. \nFrom here we begin identifying how each word in the sentence can connect to the others. \nIf we remove \"every time she thought,\" what connects the phrase to the rest of the sentence is \"what happened.\" \nIf we remove that, we're left with the phrase \"didn't have a green plant,\" so we can eliminate the rest of the sentence. We can then consider what this phrase actually means. \nWe're left with the options: plants died, plants grew, plants flourished, and plants grew out of control. \n\"Plants died\" and \"Plants flourished\" are both incorrect form constructions, so we can eliminate those 4. \n\"Plant grew\" is correct, and implies a positive outcome, so we can eliminate \"Plants grew out of control,\" which implies the opposite.\nIt ultimately means plants died when she tried to grow them, so the answer is C: plants died. \nAnswer: C: plants died", "answer": " 18"}

Choices:  B: genius A: idiot B: gardener C: vegetarian D: farmer\nRationales: We should keep in mind that we're looking for the most likely answer, not necessarily the most accurate one. \n1. Option A: idiot. It is not an acceptable result if we assume she was a beginner gardener.\n2. Option B: gardener. It fits well with the question about her gardening capabilities. It would be reasonable to assume that someone who is experienced and knowledgeable in gardening would consider her a gardener.\n3. Option C: vegetarian. It's not necessarily related to gardening. It is also not the best assessment of her skills based on the question's premise.\n4. Option D: Farmer. It's not necessary for a good gardener to be a good farmer. It also seems an overstatement to compare a beginner gardener to a farmer.\n5. Option E: Idiot. It's an extreme overstatement to consider her an idiot, given that she is a beginner gardener. This doesn't make any sense in the context of the question.\n6.

There could be many different outcomes, such as the bank not having his accounts, or not allowing him to open a new one.\n3. Looking at the answer choices, we see that \"they created an account\" doesn't make sense since the man is already requesting a new account.\n4. \"They called the police\" could work if the man tried to break into a bank account, but it's unlikely to be a response to his request to open a new one unless the request was made in a", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "watered plant, it wasn't enough? Choices:  \u0410: water B: soil C: fertilizer D: sunflowers E: fertile soil\nRationales: The first step is to consider what the question asks.\nThe second step is to break the question into smaller, more manageable parts.\n1. In the sentence \"She sure didn't have...\" we can infer that someone is trying to make the inference of someone not knowing how to water plants (option A).\n2. The sentence \"every time she...\" gives us more information as it implies more than one incident has happened.\n3. The sentence \"thought she watered plant...\" adds even more information as it is describing an attempt to water the plant, with the expectation that it was correct.\n4. But since the plant didn't survive, we might infer (option B) that water didn't reach the plant.\n5. However, the sentence \"it wasn't enough\" contradicts this conclusion, as if not receiving enough water killed the plant.\n6. Looking at all the choices available, the best answer is B: water. Even though watering is associated with green thumb, the rest of the statement implies that even though she thought she watered properly, the water was not sufficient, which means that the plant did not get enough water. Answer: B: water \n\nInput: What was the main reason for the people building the giant robot?

Option A: To fight with colonials means to fight with the colonists, not the colonizer. The colonizers, such as the British and French, did not fight with their colonists. Colonists were native people who were taken from their homelands by colonizing powers. Colonist were not fought.

{"text": "was planting a bush she put in what would grow in? Choices:  B: rocks  C: ponds\nRationales: First, let's clarify the meaning. The phrase \"every time she thought she was putting in a bush\" suggests that the woman was making frequent attempts to grow vegetation, but despite her intentions, nothing ever grew. This implies that the woman had \"bad luck\" or a lack of skill in growing plants, or in other words, she did not have a \"green thumb.\"\n6. Now, let's look at each answer option in turn. \n9. C: ponds. This is simply not true. One could never accidentally put ponds in the ground instead of plants or vegetables.\n10. B: rocks. Again, this is impossible. A rock is never confused with a plant or vegetable.\n11. These options are obviously not the correct answers. \n12. Therefore, we are left with C: ponds. If you accidentally put ponds instead of plants, that's what happened to the woman every time she thought she put in a bush. \n13.

{"text": "was planting the corn that had to be removed on what side? Choices:  corn A: the ground B: the top C: the side D: the leaves E: the flowers\nRationales: The instructions ask how to identify a \"green thumb\" from a \"poor thumb.\" The phrase \"every time she thought she was\" implies that the person is consistently trying and failing to plant corn. \n\n1. Option A: \"the ground\" may be incorrect, as it could be interpreted as dirt, as green thumb, a term used to describe someone who is good at gardening, refers to a person with superior planting skills. It's important that we eliminate this choice first as there may be a misunderstanding and confusion among test takers.\n2. Now, let's look at each remaining choice to determine the best match for a poor thumb: \n2.1. B: the top. Choice B (\"the top\") refers to removing the flowers or blooms that grow on top of a plant. This refers to a corn plant removing blossoms, not the root or plant itself.\n2.2. C: the side. Choice C (\"the side\") simply refers to removing the stalks that grow on the side of the corn plant, indicating it isn't the correct answer choice.\n2.3. D: the leaves. Choice D (\"the leaves\") refers to removing the leaves from a corn plant. It is possible that the test-taker was confused and thought the word \"leaves\" referred to the corn plant stem, but this is unlikely given the context of the question.\n2.4. E: the flowers. The option E (\"the flowers\") is the last option, and the best fit for eliminating the choice that most likely caused the misunderstanding. This refers to the flowers growing on the stalk, similar to choice B (\"the top\").\n3. Therefore, the answer that matches the choice that was likely confused by test takers is E: the flowers.\nAnswer: E the flowers\n\nInput: What are they wearing to the party?

{"text": "was watering the plants, they ended up dying. Choices:  A : blue thumb  B: purple thumb C: red thumb D: yellow thumb E: none of the above\nRationales: The first step is to figure out the meaning of \"green finger\". To do it, we have to understand what the word \"finger\" means. Let's remember the definition of the word \"finger\": the finger of the hand, or one of the five digits on each hand in human beings. \nThe second step is to figure out what to do with this information. We must understand what the phrase \"had a green thumb\" means. In this case, to say someone \"had a green thumb,\" is to say that this person was good at growing plants, their hand had a tendency to make plants grow well. The word \"finger\" is meant to imply \"talent\" in this phrase. \nTo determine the meaning of \"she didn't have a good talent\" we will first need to understand the meaning of \"had a green thumb.\" So, let's continue: \n\"she failed to have the best talent.\" This can be rephrased as, \"she failed to show what she was best at\", or, \"she failed to produce anything good.\" \nIn our word search, we can think of \"finger\" as our best talent, \"thumb\" as our poorest talent, and our hand as our body. This leads us to understand that \"green\" finger means a good talent, and the word \"She\" is the name of our person. Accordingly, to have a green thumb means to be talented at growing things well.\n\n1. If we've properly understood what the phrase \"green thumb\" means then we can now work our way through the options. Eliminating obvious nonsense is a good place to start with A: Blue Thumb. Blue wouldn't be a color of thumb.\n2. Purple Thumb has the same problem as blue.\n3. Red Thumb isn't necessarily bad either. Red is a color, so it's similar to blue.\n4. Yellow Thumb has similar implications as red in that it's a color.\n5. None of the above has no connection to the word \"green\" at all, hence it should be the first to be eliminated. \n\nOnce we've", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": "was growing a green plant, it grew into some awful pinky plant.

The phrase, \u201cevery time she thought she was\u2026\u201d, suggests that she tries to grow a green plant but it always turns out to be something different. \nNext, it's important to look at each answer choice in terms of the situation described in the question. Consider each choice carefully. \nA: There's no mention of the specific skills or abilities required to grow a green plant, so it's unclear if she has or doesn't have a \"green thumb.\"\nB: It doesn't quite make sense for her to have \"bad hands,\" especially if she's trying to do something related to growing plants.\nC: This choice feels out of place, as it relates to the person's intention or action, not a specific plant.\nD: Again, this choice doesn't seem related to the specific skills required to grow a green thumb.\nE: Choice E: fast food relates to the specific situation of trying to grow a green plant. This choice is therefore most likely to be the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: E: fast food\n\nInput: There's an item in a home setting where you would use a paperclip, chooser: A: truck B: car C: refrigerator D: kitchen E: garbage can\nRationales: First, interpret the question to figure out the specific item.

There are several items in a typical home setting where you would have to use a paperclip: truck, car, refrigerator, kitchen, and garbage can. For each, consider the context clues from the question (i.e. they would have, where) so that you can determine which option is most likely to be correct. \nA: A truck is not a common household item where you would use a normal paperclip, so this option is likely not correct.\nB: A car is a common household item where people would use a paperclip.

E: potatoes 6. F: cabbages\nRationales:\n1. This is a situation where someone's intention does not match the intended outcome. The person was probably thinking of planting flowers and vegetable in a garden or plantation, but what they were planting was mushy slimes. This implies that they were not planting flowers and vegetation at all and had been planting something else entirely. \n2. \"What had she really been plant?\" In this context, the answer represents the actual thing she was planting. \n3. As each choice represents something different, we can assume that it's unlikely that the correct answer will match all the other choices.\n4. Based on this, the first step is to eliminate the options that don't make sense given the context and the intended outcome. \n5. Excluding choice D: cabbages, F: cabbages are out because mushrooms represent the first possible option. Mushrooms are commonly found in the wild and are often planted in gardens to be cultivated and eaten, so the first option A: tomatoes does not make sense either. \n6. Excluding choice A: tomatoes, B: mushrooms, and C: onions, we can see that E: potatoes and F: cabbages could potentially be correct answers. While it's not impossible that one could plant onions and still get mushrooms, it doesn't make sense, so this option is also eliminated. \n7. This leaves E: potatoes andF: cabbages as possible answers. \n8. To confirm, we need to consider the implications of each of the remaining options. \n9. Excluding E: potatoes, F: cabbage can be eliminated as it doesn't seem to fit the intended outcome. 10. So, this leaves us with F: cabbages as the correct answer.

Choices: \nA: water them B: dig them up C: put sealant on D: cover them E: pull them up\nRationales: The first step is to figure out the correct answer(s).\nFrom the example phrase 'Every time she thought she's' it is clear that there is an intention to use future tense. Since she hasn't done the action before we can use future tense - 'They would die' (instead of 'they will')\nThe second step is to determine which verb is being expressed. We can use the verb'she'd planted' to determine the right verb to use.\nOption D: cover, though incorrect in its structure, still suggests the right meaning i.e. to cover them.\nOption E: pull them up, though incorrect in its usage, suggests the meaning of the correct verb being used.\nTherefore the answer is E: pull them up.\n\nInput: What are two of the five senses a person can use?

This makes it unlikely for a plant to not be able to survive\n* C: dry air: air is dry when it has less than about 10% of water vapor in it. If there is a lot more water vapor in the air (more than about 80%), which is what plants are used to, then the water vapor will make up for the dry air's lack of water vapor, making it impossible for the plant not to survive.\nRationale for D: soil: this is an excellent choice.\n* Soil holds moisture to the roots of the plant, allowing it to absorb the water. If the soil was dry, then the plant would not be able to get water.\nRationale for answer choice E: sunlight: the main use of sunlight in the plant's life cycle is to photosynthesise chemicals, which store energy. It is vital for the plant to survive. A plant needs sunlight to survive. Choice E, sunlight is the correct answer. \n* The plant couldn't get sunlight because of the wrong plant being chosen for the pot.

So, this is not the correct answer choice. \n  - Shrinkage - This describes loss of size, which is usually not associated with negative traits or incompetence. So, it is not the correct answer either. \n  - Poison - While this could imply incompetence, this could also be in reference to something poisonous, which isn't negative in the sense of being incompetent.

Choice A: she watered them too much, is not a likely reason. Not every plant needs to be watered at the same rate, and it's unlikely that she was overwatering them.\n2. Choice B: she watered the plants incorrectly, could be a possible explanation. But the question implies a long-term, more permanent issue rather than a short-term problem or mistake.\n3. Choice C: the sun burts them, is not a likely cause, and it's not something that would happen due to a poorly kept garden or lack of care.\n4. Choice D: the worm eats them, could be a possible cause as well, but we should consider other options.\n5. Choice E: too much time has passed, is a plausible explanation as it suggests that the lack of care led to the death of the plants, which could be related to a lack of attention and care over time.\n6.

{"text": "had a beautiful plant it grew a leaf, what was it? Choices:  Green Rose Tree  Green Tree  Green Leaf Tree  Green Green Bush Tree\nGreen Green Leaf Tree\nRationales: Start by eliminating the choices that are obviously incorrect or do not make sense. \n1. The answer should refer to a single, specific type of plant, so, eliminating Green Rose Tree and Green Tree, which could refer to multiple types of plants including flowers and other species respectively, is the first step.\n2. Next, we can further reduce the choices without using prior knowledge. We start by considering Green Leaf Tree. Although it's called a tree, its name is ambiguous when we consider where it is. We know that the phrase \"green thumb\" is usually associated with plants that are grown indoors in a garden or in a pot, which does not leave enough space to fit a tree. Therefore, Green Leaf Tree is likely not the correct choice.\n3. Furthermore, if the choice Green Green Bush Tree included a word like \"small\" or \"shrub\" to show that it was indeed a bush-like plant, then it may be valid. However, the choice does not have this word which removes this option from consideration. \n4. Finally, we consider Green Green Bush Tree since it only contains the word \"green,\" a common descriptive word for plants. However, this choice is confusing since \"bush\" can generally represent a different type of plant compared to the choice Green Leaf Tree since a bush can typically be larger and of different height/size. Hence, the answer likely does not refer to a bush and should not contain the word \"bush.\" \n5. The only remaining choice is Green Green Leaf Tree. Even though it contains a lot of \"green,\" it makes total sense because it is probably referring to a plant that grows a lot of leaves, such as a fern. 6.

Choice (A) Friday Choice (B) Saturday Choice (C) Sunday Choice (D) Tuesday Choice (E) Thursday.\nRationales: Here are the steps to solve this 1.The first thing is to look at the options. Friday is not uncommon as a day for clubs. Saturday can also apply. 2.Sunday doesn't fit the context.\n3.

Her thumb (C): The question suggests that she didn't have a good hand when it comes to gardening, but her thumb doesn't necessarily have any connection to this. It would be unrelated.\n2.) Her garden (D): The description of everything that the narrator has done and every failed attempt at it could mean that she is trying to create a green thumb or at least a good garden. Her garden is where she is probably trying to do this, so her garden would be a very possible answer.\n3.) Her soil (A): Her soil is the foundation of her garden. If her soil happens to be good this can make or break the garden altogether.\n4.) Her luck (B): Luck is something that no one really has. It is not something that you can change or fix. Therefore, the possibility of someone trying to use luck to improve their gardening is almost impossible.\n5.) Her luck (B) should now be discarded because it doesn't fit the story's narrative as well as option D: her garden.\n6.) Her garden (D) is the answer, as the narrator is trying to make a green thumb by working on her garden.\nAnswer: D) Her garden\n\nInput: What does a chef cook for dinner party?

The prompt asks us to consider what a person didn't have. An unusual characteristic, or trait, would most likely be their green thumb, the ability to plant, grow, and maintain a garden. \n2) now resolve the possible answer choices, one in turn. (a) option A: a black thumb. This isn't a possible answer choice as it doesn't make sense in the context of the prompt. \n3) Option B: a dry thumb. This option is related to a person not having a green thumb. Dry thumb, as well as some other option choices, is similar in meaning to black thumb, and can be eliminated. \n4) Option c: an itchy thumb. This isn' tell us what the person did not have as they thought they would grow a garden. \n5) Option D: a blight thumb. This option is not applicable, as \"not green\" refers to lacking the green trait. While it's possible a person's thumb could be black or blighted, this isn't the characteristic they were lacking according to the prompt. \n6) Option E: a thorny thumb. This option is also not applicable, as a person might have this trait but is still able to have a successful garden.\n7) With the help of the remaining choices we can figure that her thumb must've been \"not green\", meaning lacking the green trait as her goal would be to \"have a garden\" thus, it is option E. \nAnswer: E: a thorn thumb", "answer": " 31"}

Green thumb is similar to A: not having a good green thumb.\n2. In terms of gardening or agriculture, \"Master grower\" could be used as another term for a good green thumb. This choice is similar to A and E, so they can be eliminated.\n3. Gardening and agriculture involve growing plants, and so \"not good at growing plants\" (choice B), which is another way of saying \"not good at gardening\" (choice C), is a redundant and uninformative answer. Therefore, E is the correct choice.\nAnswer: E not good at growing flies or vegetables\n\nInput: Who can understands both American and Spanish, A: immigrant B: traveler C: bilingual D: native E: student living in each country\nRationales: First, understand the entire question to correctly interpret the options. 1. The first sentence focuses on the person who is able to communicate in Spanish. 2. The second sentence focuses on the country where they are living. 3. Consider each option one by one:\n(C) bilingual. This is an ambiguous answer as bilingual does not clarify where a person speaks both languages. It may refer to someone who has learned both languages, but it is not obvious which country they speak and understand in.\n(D) native. This is a good answer, but we are now looking for someone who can communicate in both Spanish and American.

If \"she\" didn't have a \"green thumb,\" it means she couldn't successfully use a plant in a garden or flowerpot.\nNext, we move on to the answer choices. Each choice represents a possible issue that could cause a lack of success when it comes to plant care, and one has to consider if any of them apply.\nIf one thinks \"every time she thought she was applying water, she ended starving the plant,\" the problem is too much water. This would lead to overwatering and root rot. This is the clear choice for a good answer.\nAnswer: B. too much water\n\nInput: If you've recently purchased a car, what do you need to get it cleaned? Choices: 1. A: shampoo (clean a) 2. B: bucket (car) 3. C: car cleaner (car) 4. D: polish (car) 5. E: tow truck\nRationales: It's important to first grasp the context and meaning of the question.\nThe question asks us about getting a car cleaned. This implies that a person who recently purchased a car may need to get it clean.\nWe now need to consider the answer choices, choosing one that suits the context and meaning of a car buyer needing to get their new car clean.\n\nChoices:  1. \"A: shampoo.\" Shampoo is used to clean hair, but not a vehicle. Therefore, this is not an appropriate answer.\n2. \"B: bucket\" could be used to clean a car.

The passage indicates that someone didn't have a \"green thumb\" when they tried to plant something, hence, we're looking for which item it could be.\n1. Herbs (1) and seeds (2) are not specific things to plant, but plants in general. It implies trying to plant something that would grow, but not specific plants.\n2. Flowers (3) are typically grown from seeds or through other means, so this answer doesn't seem like a likely.\n3. Trees (4) are grown from acorns or seeds, so this answer also doesn't seem like an appropriate response.\n4. Grass (5) is a common plant to grow, but doesn't always come from seeds or herbs, so this answer doesn\u2019t fit well.\n5.

Choices: 1. A: dry cleaners C: tailor B: curtain store D: clothier E: clothing store\nRationales 1. The question is asking about a specific activity of \"shopping for clothes\" that requires \"waiting for a service.\"\n2. Dry cleaners (choice C) doesn't require a service to be provided, since they clean clothes based on a set schedule and without a need for customer interactions. Also, they are an established business that does not typically entail waiting due to limited customer service hours.\n3. Tailors (choice B) require more customer interaction and do provide tailoring services, but it's unlikely that people shop for tailoring services on a whim.\n4. Clothiers (choice D) and curtain stores (choice C) are both related to custom clothing. Since the latter refers to curtain fabric specifically, curtain stores might be a suitable answer, but it's still not a definitive answer to the question.\n5. Clothing stores (choice E) are more likely candidates, as they sell both pre-made and made-to-order clothing.

For example, if we thought she was giving it more water, it's likely that the opposite may be the case.

The best answer would be something that would kill plants. This can be indicated by phrases like \"every time she thought she was ______, she'd kill the plants\". This suggests that the actions described should not be done if the person is to preserve the plants.\n1. Choice A: Taking care of plants is an action which would help someone grow plants; however, if the plants die, then this contradicts the statement, \"every time she thought......she killed the plants\".\n2. Choice B: Going outside is not an action that will directly kill the plants. It may mean a change in weather, which may affect the plants if they are outside, however, it may be too vague an action to determine whether it kills plants directly.\n3. Choice C: Playing video games. This may make the person less energized and attentive or affect her physical well-being, but the action is not likely to directly kill plants; it may only cause indirect damage to plant health in some cases.\n4. Choice D: Being kind. This can be considered a potential action that may be performed with the person, which she would be trying if she was trying to help grow plants. However, the sentence does not indicate that being kind kills the plants, hence it cannot be chosen as the correct answer.\n5. Choice E: Not giving up. This action can probably be considered when we are trying to overcome an obstacle, but in this context it implies persistence in the face of adversity or effort to try and change something. Again, does not give any concrete reference to the sentence.\n6. The correct answer in this case needs to be one which can lead to the action or decision being performed that kills the plants. Choice E: not giving up can indirectly indicate someone will keep trying, hence giving up on the whole process of growing plants.

{"text": "planted a flower it came up dead, is she trying a new hobby? Choices:  P: gardening Q: decorating R: farming S: interior design\nRationales: The question asks about a person they may be trying a new hobbie based on her behavior. \n1. The literal meaning of phrase \"everytime she thought she planted flower it came up dead\" is \"everytime she thought it was a flower and she planted it, it came up dead\"\n2. Based on this sentence, the phrase can be interpreted as meaning the person thought it was a flower (an easy mistake for someone who might not know about the flower's requirements to grow in an environment) and plant it (perhaps without enough consideration for the care and maintenance needed)\n3. Farming (Choice S) is a hobby in the literal and direct meaning of the question, but it would be unusual for a person to mistake a plant that grows well in their house as one that can only be grown outside\n4. In this case decorating is the choice that makes the most sense, because of the literal meaning of the question, it is a hobby someone would most like to try based on her circumstances\n5. Incorrect answer choices:  Q: Decorating is not a new hobbie someone who hasn't planted flowers before would likely try or even know about\n6. R: Farming is not uncommon for people to try as a hobbie, based on misconception that any plants are growing outside can be planted anywhere\n7. P: Gardening (as in growing plants inside and outside) is a hobbie someone most commonly pursues after spending time developing their horticulturist skills, or after learning about the plants' requirements\n8. S: Interior design is the hobbie to try the least because of the likelihood of a person who can barely grow plants outside trying to decorate their house\n9. Therefore, choice is D: Decorating\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe key to solving these kinds of questions is to recognize the meaning of the statement and the possible answers.

Oregano, basil, cucumber, and bell pepper are all vegetables that can be eaten raw and are commonly used to garnish or enhance the flavor of dishes. \nStep 2 - Kale and spinach are leaves - leaves are not suitable on pizza because they would not be cooked or baked, rendering the end product inedible.

It's important not to over-think or over-analyze the question. The question is straightforward - it's asking which of the given options most closely matches the favorite season, so the best answer is any option that most strongly matches the preferred season. \n5. If someone says their favorite season is spring, then the best answer is most likely an option that matches \"spring\" according to a commonly-understood definition of the word. \n6. As a result, if someone says their favorite season of the year is \"spring,\" then the best answer to this question is \"March\" or \"April.\"\n7. If someone says that their favorite season of the four seasons is \"summer,\" then the best answer will be \"August\" or \"July.\"\n8. This is because \"summer\" is understood as the warmest season of the year, and August and July are the days of the year when it's typically hottest. \n9.

Choices A and B: planting and taking care of. These are not related to doing something bad and can be eliminated.\n4. Choice C: killing or destroying something. This is the appropriate choice to answer the question.\n5. Choice D: watering. This is an odd choice to be asked in the question.\n6. Last choice: E: eating. This is only related to plants when you refer to the leaves, fruit, etc. However, in this context, the fruit isn't what people tend to water, so we can eliminate it.\n7.

A: close B: enter C: lock D: exit E: look\nRationales: This question is asking to find a possible action on what. The first step is understanding that the question is asking if you can take an action to use the door.\n3. Choice A: close. This is the correct answer. The door can't be used if it is closed.\n4. Choices B, C and D: enter, lock and exit. These are choices on how to use the door. They are not on what to do to actually use the door.\n5. Now we're left with choice E: look.

Choices: A: seeds B: roots C: fruit D: leaf E: stem\nRationales: First, we understand why she chopped away plants before they started to grow. She was unaware of what was required to succeed at growing plants.\nThen, we evaluate the options.\nOption A: seeds: This doesn't make sense, as seeds are what allows a plant to grow in the first place. This is unlikely to be the correct answer.\nOption B: roots: Root systems do not usually start to develop until days or even weeks after the plant has been planted. This doesn't imply an instant reaction, either. This leaves us with two options remaining.\nOption C: fruit: In some situations, fruit can be formed relatively quickly. However, it would not be enough to determine if the plant would survive. This does not fit the example given, as the reason for cutting down the plant is to avoid starting a plant at all. This leaves the only remaining option is E: stem.\nAnswer: E. Stem: The best answer is E: stem, because the reason for cutting away the plant before it had fruit was that it would be easier to grow another plant.\n\nInput: She saw three men standing, they all had hats on, which one is wrong? Choices: A. red B. green C. hood H  D E F. white\nRationales: As it's a multiple choice question, we need to consider what each option could mean to try and determine the correct one.\nThe question mentions seeing three men standing. Each of the options is associated with a single man, so we need to consider the characteristics of the man to try and determine which it's talking about.\nLet's examine each option. \nOption A: red. The man's hat is red. \nOption B: green. The man's cap is green. \nOption C: hood. The man's hood is green-colored, but it's on the wrong person, so this is not correct. \nOption  D: white.

{"text": "had the plant growing she ______. Choices:  A. took care of it B. died C. killed it D. gave up E. killed the owner\nRationales: The answer to this question should describe what a person would do when they are unable to grow a plant. This choice should accurately reflect the situation of a person who has tried to grow a plant multiple times but has had little to no success. \nOptions A: took care of the plant\n\nThis option does not seem to fit the context of the question's sentence. It does not accurately reflect the situation faced by a person who has tried and failed to grow a plant multiple time.\n\nOptions B: died\n\nThis option does seem to fit the context in some ways, as a person who had been trying to grow a plant but was never successful could be argued to be in a state of constant struggle and stress. However, the use of the word \"die\" seems to be stretched, and the phrase \"time she thought she had the plnt growing\" seems to be confusing and confusing. These factors weaken the case for choosing this option.\n\nOptions C: killed it\n\nThis option does appear to be a valid choice, as its literal meaning suggests that someone who has been trying to grow a plnt for a long time and never seen success might take drastic action like killing the plant. However, the phraseology \"she sure didn't  have a green thumb\" suggests that the person's inability to grow the plant was not due to negligence but rather some other cause that she couldn't control. This factor weakens the case for this option. \n\nOptions D: gave up\n\nThis option is similar to the previous one, as it could be seen as someone giving up hope on ever being able to grow a plant, but its phrasing does not accurately reflect a person giving up who has tried and failed many times previously. \n\nOption E: killed the owner\n\nThis option seems like it might fit the context, as \"she sure had a green thumb\" could be interpreted to mean that she had skill or talent in growing plants, potentially leading to the person's interpretation of a person who tried and failed to grow plants taking action against the person who was in charge of the plant. However, this is just one possible interpretation of the phrase, and there are others that weaken this option. \nTherefore, Option", "answer": " 24"}

The prompt describes a situation where the narrator believes the subject has failed at growing flowers, implying that she is not good at it.\nNext, consider the possible answer choices and think about what a successful gardener would do. A. was a gardiner- a gardener is someone who grows flowers and other plants in a garden or other managed plot. This would be an incorrect choice since it would describe someone who successfully plants and cultivates crops.\nC. too much time- This describes someone who has a lot of free time, which would be irrelevant to the question.\nD. was a farmer- A farmer grows crops or raises livestock in a large space, usually in the countryside.

Tulips are a type of flower, not grass, so A: is wrong because it's misinterpreting the question.\n\nWe should eliminate choice A first.\n\nNext, we should check choice B: weeds. This is not related to what has happened previously. In other words, it's not a previous event or action. Therefore, B: is incorrect as well.\n\nMoving on to choice C: rain. Because this answer was eliminated, we can check choice D: mice would dig the lawn. Mice are often found digging up the ground in search of plants or food, so D: is correct because it's a reasonable result of the situation described in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: mice would eat the grass.\n\nAnswer: D: mice would die\n\nInput: She did not let it show, it was actually her, and she had to leave town.

We can narrow it down to A: Weeds; B: flowers; C: gardens; D: vegetables; and E: Wrong. \n3. Weed: She accidentally plants a weed.\n4. flowers: She accidentally plants flowers instead of vegetables/vegetation.\n5. Gardens: She accidentally plants the wrong type of flowers or vegetation.\n6. vegetables: She accidentally planted the wrong vegetables.\n7. Wrong: She accidentally picked the wrong vegetation for her garden/planting. \n8. We need to eliminate flowers and vegetables: The sentences imply that she would have done something wrong on purpose.

{"text": "was what? Choices:  green thumb A: success B: beautiful C: talent D: happy E: gift\nRationales: Now the question asks about what happens to plant life when one doesn't have a green (successful) thumb. The answer should relate to gardening, plants, or other such activities.\n1. Starting with A, green thumb is certainly not the intended answer, since a person can't have a positive, green thumb without having one in the first place.\n2. B, talent is not necessarily related to gardening or the growing of plants.\n3. While a plant might be attractive, its appearance has nothing to do with gardening as a skill.\n4. D, happy is not a relevant attribute of what happens to one's gardens.\n5. Considering E, a gift may be considered an attribute of gardening, since it could be an intended or desired result from efforts, though it doesn't necessarily have to be.\n6. However, since the question asks about the outcome of not having a green thumb, the gift shouldn't be the answer.\n7. The final answer is thus C: talent. This fits the most as the end result of having a green thumb, but not an attribute of how one got there.\nAnswer: C; talent\n\nInput: While walking by the car, I saw it was a lot bigger then mine, what did the owner do?

Each of the provided answer choices is a specific action or situation related to owning a car. \n3. Although option E: \"upsize\" is a common term referring to the use of a bigger car, it's a descriptive term that is not part of the action in the question, so it does not represent the answer.\n4.

{"text": "would grow flowers, she would do what? Choices: 1: water them, A 2: transplant them, B 3: kill them off, C 4: plant them in the wrong area, D 5: not feed them, D\nRationales: This question asks to identify what a person does every time they try to grow flowers.\nThere are 4 possible choices. Consider each option.\n1. Water them. This makes sense, as it is necessary for the growth and development of plants, especially when starting seeds or young plants.\nHowever, the sentence also mentions that the person \"would kill them off.\" This indicates that watering alone would not be sufficient for the person to continue trying to grow flowers.\n2. Transplant them. This could be a reason, as sometimes plants need to be transplanted to a different area in order to get the best growth.\nThis is often done when a plant outgrows its current pot or is in an inappropriate location, like a container or hanging basket.\nHowever, the statement \"She sure didn't have green thumb\" suggests that this is more common than wanted in this case.\n3. Kill them off. This is the most direct answer to the question. The person is not having success growing flowers because they are always killing them off.\n4. Plant them in the wrong area. Maybe the person simply isn't very knowledgeable about where flowers like to grow, so they keep planting them in the wrong environment.\nPlanting them in the wrong place could explain why the flowers die off or not grow properly.\nHowever, a green thumb is often associated with an ability to know where and how to properly plant a specific plant or flowers.\n5. Not feed them. Maybe the person isn't feeding the flowers enough, which could explain why they are not growing. However, it's also possible that other factors like water or location are preventing the flowers from growing.\nIn any case, the key focus is their failure to do what they attempted by regularly killing them off, which makes A: Watering them. \nThe choice 'Watering' is indeed a valid answer and makes the strongest statement.\nAnswer: A)Watering\n\nInput: What did they buy after taking out a loan?

{"text": "did, her flower died. How long after watering should she wait for it to look full and green? Choices: 1 hour 2 hours 3 hours 4 hours 5 hours\nRationales: First, let me mention that when solving problems like this one, it can be helpful to simplify them. So, in this case, we can ask how long after watering for a flower to look full and green.\n1. The first step would be to determine the conditions under which the flower would usually be considered to be green.\n2. The second step would be to determine when it is usually watered.\n3. Given that information, it becomes apparent that the answer to the question is: 3 hours.\n4. Considering that watering the flower should make it green, there is no benefit to watering it too often.\n5. Considering that water is usually provided in amounts suitable for the flower to look green and healthy, it is reasonable to assume that water applied to the flower would produce the desired results.\n6. Thus, 3 hours after watering is the right time, and other options are therefore eliminated.\n7. The best answer is option B: 3 hours. \n\nInput: Are you looking to buy a car that is fast? Choices:  Vehicles A: Hatchback B: Coup\u00e9 C: Station wagon D: Truck E: Sedan\nRationales: This particular problem requires taking into account a few considerations before moving into a question: 1. The type of vehicle/motor one is looking for.\n2. The style or look one is interested in. \n3. The price range one is willing to consider. \nStep 1) Let's define the term \"fast\" more specifically. First, we consider the speed of the vehicle.\nStep 2) It is clear that the answer is only applicable to motor-driven vehicles. If one is looking to buy a bicycle or scooter, option A or B would be correct answers.\nStep 3) It's possible to have a fast vehicle in a smaller body type. For example, a sports car could be both fast and compact. That being said, larger vehicles like sedans will often have more powerful engines. The main difference between a small and a large vehicle is not the speed per se but the ease of movement and handling. So,", "answer": " 8"}

We can start the elimination process by ruling out choices that are clearly incorrect. Choice A: Tires - this has nothing to do with gardening, and choice B: Chocolate - this has literally nothing to do with gardens - it has to do with consuming food products, Choice C: Garden Tools, this has nothing to do in this situation with her garden. Her Garden tools, if used, might help her to tend the garden, they won't wilt it. And choice D: Garden bags, this again has nothing to do with her garden. Choice E herbs - this is probably wrong because you can't just put herbs in your garden and it wilts - herbs need constant water and attention. \n2. This leaves us with choice E: Herbs, as the subject is describing a situation where every time she tries to tend her garden (her herbs), her herbs wilt in 2 weeks.\nAnswer: E. Herbs.

{"text": "'d start she always ended up getting which part of the plant? Choices:  a: trunk b: blooms c: flowers d: roots e: spine\nRationales: The phrase \"every time she thought she' d start she always ended up\" implies that she was attempting to grow the plant, even though she failed in the end.\n1. \"A green thumb\" is said to refer to people who have a knack for gardening, and having one suggests expertise and success in the field. \n2. Therefore, choice A: trunk is incorrect as having a green thumb is not related to growing the trunk of the plant. Choice B: blooms can also be excluded as it refers to something external to the plant rather than the plant itself.\n3. Choice C: flowers is also off because a \"green thumb\" is associated with growing plants and flowers are not necessarily considered plants.\n4. Choice D: roots is not linked to having a green thumb and is also not something that the person was trying to start growing.\n5. Choice E: spine is a body part that grows from the plant, rather than something related to actual plant growth. \n6. \"Ending up\" also implies that the person couldn't grow this particular plant. \n7. Choice C: Flowers represents the plant itself, which the person was trying to grow. \n8.

{"text": "was finished, something else was eaten by what? Choices: 1. dog A: cats B: bees C: birds D: rabbits E: squirrels F: snakes G: worms\nRationales: We use the following steps in this question:\n1. First, understand what the question is. The phrase \"She sure didn't have\" suggests that the individual in question might have problems with gardening if the rest of the sentence is connected to gardening. \n2. Interpret the answer choices. We must determine which of the choices is most likely to complete the rest of the question.\n3. \"She didn't have a Green Thumb\" does not relate to eating - it's what someone can do or cannot do in a setting. Therefore, this option cannot be applied.\n4. \"Dog\" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it is unlikely that a person would have problems with a green thumb if they have a dog in their garden. \n5. \"Birds\", \"Rabbits\", \"Snakes\", and \"Squirrels\" are not likely candidates as their diet does not include green plants and most of these could coexist with gardens.\n6. \"Bees\" can, indeed, eat green plants but generally they do not, as they prefer nectar, honey, and pollen. In this context, this option also does not work as bees can pollinate flowers instead of eating the whole plant, unless perhaps the person means garden pests.\n7. \"Cats\" and \"Worms\" might be a possible option with garden pests, but that's not what the question was focusing on.\n8. Therefore \"G\", \"B\", \"D\", and \"F\" could potentially be correct answers. However, the rest of the sentence indicates that something was eaten; therefore, the answer might be more obvious.\n9. Moving to answer choices B and D, both \"Birds\" and \"Rabbits\" are not eating something. So this indicates the answer must be an animal that eats plants.\n10.

The phrase \"She sure died\" is used to describe the death of a person. \nA: Green thumb implies having a talent for growing plants. The word \"time\" is used previously, so it's possible that the question means she kept having the same failure to grow a healthy plant. \nB: This option refers to the action of \"planting a tree\" and does not directly correspond to the previous phrase. \nC: This option refers to when her plants \"died\", but it doesn't explain why that was. \nD: This refers to when a person \"died\", so it doesn't have much to do with the previous statement. \nE: \"every time she thought she was\" should be read as \"she thought that she was\", so that the first part of the previous phrase is reused. \nTherefore, the best answer is Choice D \"She sure died\".\nAnswer: D: she sure died\n\nInput: How would you pronounce: a) tsunami b) caymus c) tsunamo\nRationales: Tsunami: this word can be pronounced with T or with D in the beginning, so the correct way to pronounce it is tsoo-nah-me.\nCaymus: This word is two syllables - TSOO + mah\nTsuname: This is not a correct word and hence incorrect to pronounce it either way.\nAnswer: tsoo-nah me \n\nInput: What type of dog is this?\n\nChoices A: Terrier B: Australian C: Boxer D: Chow E: Pomeranian F: Schnauzer\n\nRationales:\nThe question here describes the given dog as the one who would \u201cgive you an ice cold treat.\u201d The answer should be consistent with the given clue to provide a relevant answer and not diverge from it.\n1.

We need to select an option that describes this pattern of behavior and identify what it tells us about the person's ability to grow plants. \nStarting with the answer choices:\n1. Choice A: give it fertilizer is a possible answer, as fertilizer could contain elements that would benefit the plant. However, it also implies the possibility of over-fertilizing and causing harm, which doesn't match the overall tone of the given passage.\n2. Choice B: buy a pot is unlikely, as there is no indication that the person is financially capable of purchasing new pots or that they would benefit from doing so.\n3. Choice C: give it the right amount and Choice D: give it the right temperature can both be eliminated due to the use of the term \"it's\" in the sentence. This indicates that the person is referring to one specific plant, not to the average amount or temperature required. \n4. Remaining choice is E: the plant didn't gets enough light. This is a plausible answer, as insufficient light could lead to the death of the plant. However, the choice also implies that the person provided appropriate care for the plant, including watering, fertilization, and an appropriate temperature, but it still died due to the lack of adequate light. Hence, this isn't the most suitable answer, as it doesn't fit with the overall characterization of the person's care for the plant.

{"text": "was going to grow plants, they all died. What could they have to do with flowers? Choices:  a. A: cough C: headache B: D: heart attack E: headache\nThe question asks us to identify an area in which the green thumb is needed and to associate a condition with that area. By reading the phrase \"they all died,\" we can infer that plants did not survive. The phrase \"She didn't have a ______ thumb\" hints that a green thumb is needed to grow healthy plants, and the green thumb is an indication of a good gardener. In other words, the green thumb is associated with being good at growing plants, and not associated with coughs, headaches, or heart attacks, hence eliminating those options. \"Flowers\" are associated with a garden, so this is the most likely answer. The most common response is that the person didn't have a good garden, meaning they didn't have a successful green thumb, so they may have had a headache.

{"text": "was going to have plants, Choices:  A plant: green B plant: flowers C pot: plant D soil: flower E plant: green\nRationales: The question asks about a situation where someone was thinking they are going to have plants, but in the end ended up with something else.\n\nAnswer: \nStep 1. Interpret the meaning of the riddle.\nStep 2. Consider the options of  A: plant: Green,  B: plant: flowers,  C: pot: plant, D: soil: flowers, and E: plant: green.\nStep 3. Select the option that represents the situation described.\nStep 4. Explain how the selected option matches the situation described.\n\nFirst, understand the question. \n\nLet's look at the expression \"every time she thought she was gonna have plant\" and consider what this means.\n\nShe does not have a \"green thumb\".\n\nShe doesn't have a \"plant\": she doesn't have \"a green thumb\", so she cannot grow plants.\n\nWhen she thinks she will have a plant.\n\nThe question states that every time she thought she would have plants, she ended up with something different.\n\nSo every time she thought she could make a plant.\n\nShe couldn't grow one.\n\nNow that we've looked at the meaning of the question.\n\nConsider the options.\n\nPlant: green: This one actually refers to green plants. She has a green thumb, and this means she has the ability to grow plants, as implied by the riddle.\n\nPlan: flowers: This one refers to growing flowers. The phrase \"every time\" in the riddle implies failure in growing plants and the person's inability to accomplish this task, which seems unlikely to happen when growing flowers.\n\nPlan: pot: This refers to keeping plants in pots, not growing them. We cannot consider this option as it doesn't fit with the question nor the person's supposed inability to grow plants.\n\nPlan: soil: This refers to the material used by plants to grow underground. So this doesn't fit with what is stated in the question and could be dismissed.\n\nPlan; green: This refers to the color green, as a color. This one also doesn't fit with either the person's abilities or their previous", "answer": " 160"}
{"text": "had a good idea, it failed. Choices:  A; couldn't succeed B: was the only thing C: had to work D: was a terrible solution E: wasn't useful\nRationales: The question asks about the girl in the story, and it's important to understand her situation to determine the answer.\n1. \"She sure didn't have green thumb,\" implies a lack of success in the past and a continued potential for failure.\n2. The phrase about \"good ideas\" suggests a positive outlook or approach. This is in contrast to the phrase \"it failed.\"\n3. Therefore, option B: having a good idea doesn't indicate success, rather a more neutral stance.\n4. Option C: having to work refers to a labor-intensive solution. Option D: having a terrible solution is the opposite of \"it failed\" in the context.\n5. Option E: having a useful solution could be related to the \"good idea\" referred to in the question.\n6. While it's possible for option E: to have a useful solution to be related to the same \"good idea,\" the word \"the only thing\" suggests it's a specific solution, not one of many alternative solutions.\n7. The correct answer is A: wasn't successful, which is the best interpretation of what was meant by the phrase \"had a good idea.\"\nAnswer: A: wasn't sucessful\n\nInput: What's the best idea to replace 24 with a new number? Choices: 1: One A: replace B: add C: revoke D: increase E: alter\nRationales: First, consider the context of the question. A number is being replaced by a new number, and we are looking for a suitable replacement.\n2. The choices A: replace and D: increase suggest possible answers. However, choice A: replace doesn't make sense as \"a number\" cannot be replaced, only the value of the number can be replaced.\n3. Choice D: increase does not make sense as it suggests adding a value to the number rather than replacing it.\n4. Option E: alter is also not a suitable option as this suggests making a change to the number rather than taking it away.\n5. Only option B: \"adding\" a new number to the original number appears to be a suitable replacement. This is also the best choice", "answer": " 65"}
{"text": "did something to gardening? Choices:  a: cut her plants b: put them in the sun c: feed the plants d: prune the plant e: water the plants\nRationales:1. We go from start to finish.\n2. First, we read the question and understand what it is asking us.\n3. The question is asking us to identify a past effort that failed despite someone else's best efforts, known as a \"green thumb\".\n4. The answer for the \"green thumb\" is b: \"put them in the sun.\"\n5. The next step is examining the given possible answer choices.\n6. Considering A: \"cut her plants,\" the given definition of \"green thumb\" is not fulfilled, as a \"cut\" removes the green parts of the plant.\n7. Choice B: \"feed the plants,\" is not correct because feeding plants is not what the question refers to and can only be done to animals instead of fruits and vegetables.\n8. Choice C: \"prune the plant,\" is an unnecessary detail that is being given as the correct answer choice.\n9. Choice D: \"water the plants,\" is not the correct answer because \"water\" only refers to drinks and foods that are liquid.\n10. Choice E: \"green thumb,\" is the correct answer because the entire phrase refers to \"having a green thumb,\" which means having a natural ability in gardening without making mistakes.\nAnswer: E green thumb\n\nInput: It was a bad date - why did it not go well?

The question asks why one bad date did not go well, but the question does not specify why the date was bad. Therefore, the answer should be an explanation of the date ending in a way that was not ideal for the dates themselves. 2. The answer given, 1, does not provide a good reason why the date didn't go well. The word \"personality\" is vague and does not provide enough detail for us to infer an explanation. 3.

{"text": "grew what? Choices:  Green Fiddleheads, Green Onions, Green Lentils, Green Chlorophyll, Green Cabbage\nRationales: This is a difficult question because it requires us to deduce what could be grown from the clues, and it\u2019s unclear if the speaker is speaking about actual plants or a type of produce.\n\nWe can start by eliminating some options. Since \u201cshe\u201d in the sentence is female, the word \u201cwho\u201d or \u201cwhat\u201d should be used to specify the object being grown.\n\nFirst, Option A: Green Fiddleheads. Fiddleheads are the curled or coiled portion of immature asparagus plants, and they are often picked or grown to be eaten in salads, soups, or stews.\n\nSince fiddleheads are typically found in the wild, they may not be considered a \u201cgreen thumb\u201d since they may not be grown by the person; therefore, this option is irrelevant.\n\nNext, Option B: Green Onions. Green onions are the same as scallions or spring onions; they are a young, tender onion, typically grown in small numbers and eaten before they develop a tough, mature texture or taste.\n\nLike fiddleheads, green onions grow in the wild, and they can be considered a type of produce like tomatoes, cabbage, or corn.\n\nIn context, \u201cevery time she thought she grew\u201d indicates that the speaker believes something is wrong with the person\u2019s growing process. This may be that the person cannot actually produce anything or that something is wrong with how the person grows their plants.\n\nTherefore, the speaker may not consider green onions a valid answer since the phrase \u201cevery time she thought\u201d indicates that something may be problematic; hence, we can eliminate option A and option B. \n\nContinuing to look at the remaining options, Option C: Green Lentils. Green lentils are a type of legume (e.g. peas, beans) that are typically grown in South Asia, East Africa, and regions of the southern United States.\n\nThese vegetables are grown for consumption, and they are typically grown in large quantities; lentils are not generally considered a small quantity of produce like cabbages or corn.\n\nThe term \u201cgreen thumb\u201d is generally applied more", "answer": " 168"}
{"text": "planted something it turned out to be __________ instead. Choices:  A  vegetables B  flower C  weeds D  fruit E  grass\nRationales: The question is asking us to determine what the girl was not able to adequately grow. In order to answer this question, we need to understand the context of the situation, i.e., the girl who did not have a green thumb was growing something, which turned out to be a disaster every time.\n\nGiven the context, we can eliminate answer choices that cannot be related to the girl's inability to grow vegetables.\n\nA: vegetables is possible, but it is still a possibility, although unlikely, compared to the others.\n\nB: flower. This is more likely to be the correct choice, as flowers require higher attention than vegetables. But we can still eliminate this option, as the girl did not take care of her flowers.\n\nC: weeds. We don't know if the girl planted weeds with intention, or if they grew on their own, but if she did plant them, then it would indicate she did take care of them. So, we can exclude this as an answer.\n\nD: fruit. This is likely related to the girl' s inability to nurture her plant life, as you cannot grow fruit without taking care of plants long enough for them to bloom. But, the question asks about the specific result of the girl's actions, and not the reasons behind them. \n\nE: grass. This would be the most likely answer, as grass doesn't require much attention compared to flower, but it is not mentioned in the question.\n\nAfter considering each option, the answer with the least amount of reasoning is option D: fruit.\n\nAnswer: D: fruit\n\nInput: The best thing to do if you're in a hurry and want to get in  ________ is to take a bus  Choices:  A. the same car as the other ones B. different car than the others C. the fastest car D. the fastest bus E. any car with more people in it\nRationales: First, understand the question: we read that if we're in a hurries and want to get on the bus that the best thing to do would be to take one that goes really fast.\n\nThe choices are very similar", "answer": " 90"}

Choices:  Tip: This is a question that's asking about a person's behavior. \"What would you do now?\" means you should respond to their behavior and imagine how you would act if you were in their position.\nRationales: The question starts \"She sure didn't have green thumb every time she thought she...\" which implies a specific behavior that has already been done repeatedly.\n\nThe second sentence \"what would you do now?\" refers to the possible response to the already done behavior.\n\nIf the person \"sure didn't have a greent thumb\", it would be natural to assume that they were unable to successfully grow plants.\n\nThe sentence \"every time she thought she had...\" would suggest that despite their perceived success, the person ultimately failed.\n\nGiven this behavior, it would be best to respond by acknowledging her efforts and offering a different approach to plant care.\nAnswer: Tip: A: acknowledge her efforts: This response would acknowledge the person's efforts and recognize that although her attempts may not have worked out, she may still be open to trying something new.\nAnswer: A acknowledge her efforts\n\nInput: Your computer screen is broken, what makes it not function properly? Choices:  I: screen II: computer III: light IV: sound V: battery\nRationales: There are two main sources of information to consider for this question. The first are the options offered, which provide some possible causes for a broken screen.\n\nThe second is the text of the question, which may offer additional context or suggestions for other potential causes.\n\nBy considering all the options given and the context provided, we can identify the most likely answer. \n\nOption I, \"screen,\" is the first and most straightforward choice, as it refers to the physical screen on the computer. \n\nThis means the computer is unable to display images or text on its screen.\n\nOption II, \"computer,\" is a possible cause as the computer itself can be malfunctioning without a broken screen, but given the sentence \"light\", this cannot be the answer.\n\nOption III, \"light,\" is a possible answer as the computer screen may not be able to function properly if it is not properly illuminated.\n\nHowever, given the text of the question (screen being broken), \"light\" cannot be", "answer": " 730"}

{"text": "was helping plants to survive they either died, or she burned the house down. Choices:  A. Died B. Burned the house down C. Had no idea how to help plants D. All of the above are things that could happen to plants\nRationales: Now we look at the answer choices, but make sure to ignore the story first because we don't know what plants she was supposed to be helping. \n1. Death is not good if it is not an expected outcome, if anything they want the plant to survive. Death would not happen by accident, it would be from a direct cause, and if her hands are doing it directly, there has to be an indirect cause because there doesn't seem to be anything in the story that would lead to death. \n2. Burning down a house is just stupid, it's not good, it's not helping and it's not something you would choose to do for the sake of helping a plant, there is no cause for doing so. \n3. If it is a green thumb, then there is help, and if there is a reason why she was helping the plants, then she must have known how to help them because if there is a green thumb, and she didn't have a clue, then that is not a green thumb, so there would be no clue and therefore be useless regardless. Aside: A green thumb is good.\n4. We can eliminate all of the above as answer choices because it's not a choice. If she has a green thumb, then it could mean that she doesn't have any of these, or that it could mean any of these, or anything in between. If there is a green thumb for the girl who did not know how to help plants and plants die, she wouldn't be able to help them at all. \n5. That means there were no options that made sense, so answer B burned the house down as the choice that is the most likely to be selected for this task because there is no other reason for the plant to die or her to burn down the house and even if there is a reason, it has to be either the same or at least indirectly related to the plant. \nAnswer: B Burned the house down\n\nInput: The dog is hungry, what has he done to the kitchen?

{"text": "was making progress, she's not, she was having trouble keeping what? Choices: 1: plants alive 2: good grade 3: plant diseases 4: flies 5: bugs alive\nRationales: First, understand the question in its entirety.\n1. The first half of the sentence refers to someone who is not particularly good at gardening or keeping plants alive.\n2. The other half of the sentence describes what the person tried keeping alive (a plant), even though they were not good at it.\n3. Now, begin with eliminating the answer choices. In this case, it's unlikely that a person would get rid of flies or plant diseases; this is not the context in which the question is being asked. The same goes for bugs.\n4. The next choice is plant diseases, which fits the context as gardening is often affected by disease. However, in this sentence, the phrase \"thinking she was making progress\" indicates that the person had tried to keep the plant alive despite the fact that disease affected it. This means that having tried many ways to keep the plant alive, and the plant still died, the person was not able to keep it alive.\n5. Now, we look at the remaining choices. Keeping \"a good grade\" (number 2) indicates that someone is trying to achieve a certain academic goal, not that they are trying to keep a plant alive. If someone is not good at gardening, they would not intentionally try to keep a plant alive, so this choice doesn't seem to fit. Keeping \"a plant disease\" (number 3) is similarly not an appropriate answer choice. Keeping a plant disease alive is not something that a person would need to work toward, it is simply the natural process of the plant's disease occurring.\n6. Therefore, options 4 and 5 are the only two choices left. The person was trying to keep the plant alive with several methods. However, even though she put in a lot of effort and made some progress, she was not ultimately able to keep it alive, meaning she didn't have a \"green thumb\" (number 4). \n7. The last answer (number 5) is the best choice. The person may have had trouble keeping a plant alive, and maybe they even tried several methods to achieve this, but ultimately, they were unable to keep the plant alive. As", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "made an awesome plan it would go sour. Choices:  A. failed plan B. sad feeling C. drip feeder D. happy face E. sad face\nRationales: First, understand the question and use active listening skills to identify the key issues or themes in the question.\n1. The use of the adverb \"surely\" indicates that the response is positive. It does not contain the word \"unfortunately,\" which is another indicative sign that the response will be positive.\n2. Consider the phrase \"She couldn't have a green \u200bthumb.\" This is commonly used to indicate that someone is incapable of handling a task competently. In this case, it's about growing and maintaining plants and it's used to describe someone who struggles with this task.\n3. Now, consider the four options for the answer.\n4. Option A: Failed Plan - This option does not represent the main reason for the phrase, as it cannot be said that something is \"a failure\" without first having a plan to begin with.\n5. Option B: Sad Feeling - While sadness is an inevitable outcome of incompetence, it does not accurately represent the reason for the phrase in this context, as \"sad feeling\" is more of a symptom than the cause.\n6. Option C: Drip Feeder - This option could be used to indicate that the phrase \"She didn't have a good green \u200bthumb\" is referring to the plant's health, but it's still an indirect statement, as it doesn't answer or confirm whether she had a green \u200bthumber.\n7. Option D: Happy Face - This option does not fit well with the use of the adjective \"surely\". If we interpret it as \"She couldn't be sure of achieving a green thumb,\" it's still not a direct indication that she indeed didn't achieve it. Additionally, it's unlikely that someone would describe another person's face as \"surely not happy.\"\n8. Option E: Sad Face - This option is the only one that connects with \"She sure didn't have\", as it is a direct statement that something is not true. It does not mean that person's face is in fact sad and that it shouldn't be interpreted that way.\n9. Therefore the answer is", "answer": " 1050"}
{"text": "would what would be the result? Choices: .A: flowers B: a garden C: a tomato D: a vine E: weed\nRationales: The question is based on a statement about a person not having a green thumb. Here is how to interpret the statement logically: \n1. The statement implies that the subject did not have adequate success at growing plants or flowers.\n2. We need to identify what happens each time the subject attempts to grow a plant.\n3. Possible answer choices: flowers, a garden, a tomato, a vine, and a weed.\n4. \"Flowers\" would be the result only if they started growing from the seed rather than from plants grown from a garden, which we can cross out as an option.\n5. \"A garden\" - is this not referring about some sort of result, as there exists a possibility to grow flowers from a plant?\n6. \"A tomato\" - can plants grow tomatoes?\n7. \"A vine\" - can plants grow vines?\n8. \"A weed\" - is not the correct answer by definition, as \"weeds\" are plants that grow unsightly and are considered as \"agricultural weeds\".\n9. \"Green Thumb\" - implies the person growing the plant with success in the process, which is not the case here.\n10.

{"text": "saw green she started singing. Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales:\n1. First, determine whether the question is asking about the characteristics of someone who is considered to have a green thumb, or rather it is asking what would one do if they thought they saw green. In this case, the question is asking what we would do if we think we saw green, hence the answer should be a description of what we would do.\n2. The options should be relevant to the green-related aspect of the question.\n3. Starting from option A: She sure didn' t have a green thumb, a green thumb is generally considered to be someone who can grow plants well, or has some special skill with plants. So far, this is not relevant to the question, although it could be an acceptable answer to a different question.\n4. Option b: She sure didn' have a green thumb, is not relevant to the context of the question.\n5. Option C : Every time she thought she saw, this doesn't really fit either. The phrase \"thought she saw green\" has no relation with the \"thought\", so the option is dropped.\n6. Option: Every time she thought she she started singing is not relevant to the phrase \" every time she thought she,\" which indicates that she never actually saw green, so this option is irrelevant to the question as we don't need to ask what she would do if she thought she saw green.\n7.

{"text": "had planted a flower  it grew into what? Choices: 1.  A: thorns 2. B: weeds 3. C: rose bushes 4. D: grass 5. E: bushes\nRationales: The  question gives us the information that the person has not had a green thumb, so we can narrow down the choices. \nNow, let's consider each option. Each requires a little bit of analysis.\n1. Green Thumb (A: thorns) is something you are born with and cannot be affected, so this is not our answer, \n2. Weeds (B: weeds) is a commonly used term to refer to plants that grow without planning. However, in the context of the question, it may not be appropriate, as the person is specifically referring to their own failed attempts to cultivate flowers. \n3. Rose Bushes (C: rose bushes) is a possible answer, as roses are often considered to be decorative or ornamental plants, and they may not have been able to cultivate them for this reason. \n4. Grass (D: grass). Grass is often referred to as an easy plant to grow. However, in this context, the person doesn't seem to have any experience growing grass and may refer to their own lack of ability to plant or maintain grass. \n5. Bushes (E: bushes) would represent a thriving plant, and are perhaps the most likely to succeed. That being said, the phrase \"it grew into\" seems to suggest intention to cultivate flowers, so the answer could also be C: rose bushes.\nThe best answer would be C: rose bush, as it makes the most sense to choose the most likely thriving plant and fits the intent of cultivating flowers\nAnswer: C: rose bushes\n\n### Notes:Answer the following logic math question.\n\nInput: Where will you stop in the line is a person on their day off from work?

{"text": "was planting grass, she planted weeds? Choices:  B: true C: false D: blue E: white\nRationales: The question asks us to find the answer for a situation where someone planted what they thought was grass, but it was actually weeds. They did this so many times they gave up on gardening. \nThe question is asking us to identify a situation where weeding is a misidentified, assumed outcome of planting grass. \nWe then ask if this situation is true or false since it describes a situation where someone did something repeatedly without realizing or knowing it was a mistake.\nThe options then ask us to identify the colors, green and blue, that we perceive to be the right answer. \nThe answer is not necessarily true which can mean both of the options D and E.\nTherefore, the word \"true\" is an incorrect qualification and should be removed. \nThe two options without the \"true\" qualification become B: true and D: blue. \nAs the options B: true and D blue are the only ones with green and blue in them, B is the correct answer. \nAnswer: B: true\n\nInput: Are you going to work by using an app called ______? Choices:  C: lunch E: walk A: Lyft B: walk B: Uber C: ride D: Uber\nRationales: This answer may seem tricky because it requires one to use their knowledge of the company names.\n\n1. Walk - This isn't a ride, this is a mode of transportation.\n2. Lunch - While this may be a funny answer, it's also an unrelated word. This doesn't make sense with the company names.\n3. Lyft and Uber are companies that use ride share apps through ride-hailing services.\n4. Walk, Lyft, and Uber are 3 different ride share apps that are used in a similar way. They are similar companies that use the same app to share their service.\n5. Therefore, the correct choice is D.

{"text": "was growing an herb, what would happen? Choices: 1: It would grow.2: It would wither.3: It would die.4: It would blossom.5: It would sprout.\nRationales:1. The question asks about a woman who didn't have a \"green thumb\" and was attempting to grow an herb. The phrase \"she thought\" suggests that she tried to grow an herb, so we can reasonably exclude choices 2, and 5, where the herb did not grow. \n2. This leaves us with choices 3, 4, and 5, which all describe what would happen to the herb. \n3. Choice 3: It would die is the least likely answer as this describes what would happen if she tried to grow an unsuitable plant, not an herb. \n4. Choice 4: It would blosssom is plausible because we don't know what type of herb she was trying to grow, and whether it would produce blossoms, and could refer to both the leaves or the flowers. \n5. Choice 5: It would sproute could be interpreted as the herb growing, but the phrase suggests the plant dying, and then a new plant being produced.

The soil's PH is making the plants unable to thrive. b. The weather is too cold or wet for the plants to grow. c. She didn't use fertilizer. d. She overwatered the plants. e. She didn't add enough sun exposure.\nRationales: The first sentence indicates that the woman thought she was doing well in caring for her garden, yet she still didn't have enough produce to eat. \nSoil's PH is unlikely to create such a big difference, and the weather is likely to fluctuate too much to be the reason. \nShe didn't use fertlizer if she was still able to grow good plants. \nOver watering or lack of sun exposure would likely cause plants to die first, so not enough sun is likely not the problem.\nAnswer: The woman probably didn't add enough fertilizer to her plants, which likely led to the plants dying and thus producing insufficient fruits and vegetables.\nAnswer: E.\n\nInput: What do you make with potatoes?

Therefore, choice 2 is the best answer to the question.\n2. Potato salad is not the right answer for two reasons. First, it is made with mayonnaise, not potatoes, and even if it were possible to add potatoes into this dish, chances are they'd be diced, sliced or shredded like any other salad ingredient, not mashed or boiled as called for in choice 2..\n3.

Consider each option and apply logical reasoning. \n2. One possible interpretation of \"watered them but didn'tt\" is that there is not enough water.\n3. \"Overwashed\" and \"root problem\" do not seem to apply to the specific description of a plant.\n4. \"not enough water\" seems like the best answer.

Choices: A: No B: Sometimes C: Maybe D: If the right conditions are met E: Never\nRationales: First, understand the question and its context. \n\"Is there no such thing as accident?\" This is asking us to consider if accidents ever happen or if they are impossible. \nThese possible answer choices must be interpreted to determine which one best fits the question. \nNow, interpret each of the answer options: \n1. Answer A: No. While it is true that accident is a word used to refer to an unfortunate occurrence or event, it is not impossible, as accidents can and do happen frequently.\n2. Answer B: Sometimes. This is a logical answer because accidents are rare; therefore, there won't be such things as accidents all the time. \n3. Answer C: Maybe. Since some accident do happen, the usage of the word \"maybe\" makes sense.\n4. Answer D: If the right condtions are met. Accidents can happen if the right conditions are met, which indicates that accidents happen as a result of specific circumstances such as human error, mechanical failures, or other variables.\n5.

{"text": "had a plant, she would always see it with what? Choices: 1. A: yellow B: red D: blue E: white 2. A: dead C: purple F: green\nRationales:\n1. First, understand what the person did to the plant. The phrase \"thought she had a plant\" implies that a planter was put in the ground, but it didn't hold the necessary ingredients to grow.\n2. Now, consider the color that is associated with plants. A plant is usually green, and therefore, anything that doesn't have green could mean that it has died. \n3. A yellow flower could be a color associated with sunlight, but the sentence does not mention yellow flowers, so we cannot conclude that it was intentionally grown.\n4. Dead: While flowers do generally come in colors including red and blue, these are not as commonly associated with plants. It would be more common to find flowers in these colors, indicating a healthy growth, rather than yellow that could suggest something is amiss. Dead and green go together as they are both associated with a lack of life.\n5. Purple flower: Like dead and green, purple flowers are not widely associated with plants. They may represent certain plants, but it's a less common color to use in this type of context. \n6. White flower: This is also an uncommon color choice for plants. White could mean deadness in some cases, but more commonly, it represents innocence and purity, which is not associated with death.\n7. All of the above leaves us with the best option being dead or green.

The options given do not make logical sense. \n2. A: Too much sunlight\n   a. The planting of seeds is unrelated to sunlight. Instead, sunlight should help the seeds grow. \n   b. Giving a self-a pain could be the literal meaning of \u2018giving herself\u2019 a, but the question doesn\u2019t specify what a person might be hurting themselves. \n   c.

There is no mention of growing vegetables at all, but if one\u2019s vegetable garden is not producing anything, one might suggest that fertilizer is a potential issue. \n3. B: Not enough water. It is a plausible answer but not necessarily a logical one. Planting seeds usually requires a degree of watering and fertilization. \n4. C: Planted too early. This may not refer to growing vegetables at all. Again, if one\u2019s vegetables are not doing well, it could be that planting during an inappropriate time and/or season is part of the issue. \n5.

I don'tknow is not an emotional response, and thus not the correct answer. \n2. I am sorry is not an obvious emotional response either, but could be a possible one.\n3. I lost it is not directly related to their phone and is thus not the correct choice.\n4. I lost myphone is the actual phone itself, so it does not seem like the choice that best describes their response, although it is a valid one.\n5. I lost myself is the response that expresses the person's sense of losing control, perhaps due to their confusion or frustration.

(2) Determine the solution options (3) Analyze whether there is a solution for the requirements (4) Verify answer. Step (1): The question asks us to determine the outcome of a person's attempts to grow flowers. (2): We consider each option: A: weeds, B: garden, C: trees, D: gardening, E: vegetables. (3): We try to determine if each option fits the requirements: (i) \"trees\" means to sow in the earth or an area with earth, so an outdoor tree garden is more like option \"gardening\" as it is a garden with trees in it. The outdoor version of \"trees\" is excluded. (ii) Option \"gardening\" could include \"trees\" as potential garden plants. We check if it suits our requirements by elimination; one possible benefit of \"trees\" could be fresh pollen that might attract insects or animals. While this could be a possible outcome, it's not the predominant one. On the other hand, with \"vegetables\" and \"weeds\" there are many more predominant \"downsides\" as you cannot grow flowers with these types of plants. (iii) \"garden\" is similar to \"vegetables\" in the sense that it could be a place where vegetables and weeds are grown; option D and E exclude this as they are different types of places. Option B: garden is a definite possibility as gardening is a common method of growing flowers. We now verify if the option will fit our question expectations; the outcome could be a positive one such as gardening being successful or it could also be a negative one, such as gardening not succeeding in growing flowers or perhaps causing some other issue - such as \"weeds\" growing from unintended actions resulting in a garden.

The phrase, \"she sure didn't have green thumb,\" implies that the person may not be skilled at gardening. But, the next sentence indicates that the person is planting plants and that each of them dies. \n2. We can consider each of the choices: \n3. A: vegetarian. A vegetarian doesn't grow plants, so this doesn't fit the premise.\n4. B: chef. This is also irrelevant to the planting scenario, and while a chef might not necessarily have a green thumb as referred to in the question, being a chef is generally not related to planting plants and having a green thumb. \n5. C: mechanic. A mechanic may not necessarily have a greenhouse, but they are often not vegetable experts and may not have much experience with gardening and plants.\n6. D: Painter.

There are two parts to the question, separated by a semi-colon: (1) When was the last time she thought she helped? (2) And then, the plant grew we weaker. That implies that things were going backward.\n(1) Step: Determine the last plant she tried to help grow.\n(2) Step: Determining the outcome: \"weaker\" in this context means worse. In other words, it's the equivalent of \u201cit got worse\u201d or \u201cit deteriorated.\u201d\nStep 1: A: bad Choices:  Bad: A. \"Weaker\" and \"bad\" have almost the same meaning, bad is the opposite of better.\nStep 2: B: slow Choices:  Slow: B. \"Weaker\" is the opposite of \"stronger.\" \"Slow\" means progress or improvement might not look as fast as you expected, but the progress is still there.\nStep 3: C. A: sick: C. Choices: Sickly: The opposite of \"strong\" is \"sick\"; \"weaker\" is the opposite for \"strong.\"\nStep 4: D: Weak Choices: Weak: D. \"Weaker\" means the opposite of \"strong\" while \"weak\" means lack of strength.\nStep 5: E: Frail Choices: Frail: E. \"Frail\" is a synonym of \"weak.\" \"Weaker\" means opposite of \"strong.\" \"Frail\" and \"weak\" have exactly the same meanings. \"Frail or weak\" is the right answer.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "was helping the tree, it died Choices:  A : help in another way B: plant in a different place C: be healthy D: die E: remove the plant\nRationales: Here, the question asks about a previous activity and what to do now. The phrase \"she sure didn't have\" means she didn't do well. \"Helping the tree\" means planting it. \"It died\" means the plant or tree is no longer alive.\n1. Choice (B) is grammatically incorrect since \"planting in a different place\" should be \"planting in a new place\". It is excluded.\n2. Choice (C) makes no sense due to the nature of the phrase. \"Healthy\" does not necessarily relate to trees and \"health\" cannot be observed in them. It is excluded. \n3. Choice (D) fits the question completely. It means the person was trying to plant a tree, but she failed and now she wants to remove it for good. It is the correct answer. Choice (E): \"remove the plant\", is redundant. Choice (E) is excluded.\n4. Choice (A): \"help in another way\" is unnecessary as \"green thumb\" would imply that the person was trying to help the tree. Further, if she was trying to help, how did it die?\n5.

We are simply asked to understand what she was thinking.\nWe are asked to determine her most likely action upon deciding to follow the gardening instructions.\n\n1. The answer is simple. There is no possible action of forgetting (A), succeeding (B), or killing (C) a plant.\n\n2. Weed (D): This is the most likely thing she was thinking. The sentence 'She sure didn\u2019t have a green thumb' implies that she is bad at planting, watering, and keeping the plants alive. Weeding implies that she has not given up on keeping the plants alive. However, she is trying too.\n\n3.

Choices A: lots of money B: lots of time C: little money D: little time E: no money F: zero time\nRationales: The question is relatively simple. We are asked to determine how much it costs to build a room wall. There are no options where 'building' is not required, nor options that do not require much time or money.\n\n1.'wall' is a structure that is built, therefore, there is no option C: Little money and D: little time.\n\n2. 'Open floor plan' is usually a concept, not an actual 'wall'. A wall is built during construction, not a concept. We don't look at it. We look at the interior structure which has a wall.\n\n3. 'zero time' is not a time that we can build anything. Not even a wall. It is impossible to 'build' something without time.\n\n4.'No money' is obviously not an option, to begin the process of building a wall.\n\n5. 'Lots of money' is irrelevant as 'lots' isn't a measurement of time, or of anything really.\n\n6.

{"text": "'d fixed the issue, it came back bigger. Choices:  A:: plants that didn't grow B: uncultivated plants C:: plants that are not yet grown D: plants that grew unhealthy E: plants that were not maintained well\nRationales:1. First of all, we define the terms \"thought\" and \"every time\" to help narrow down the answer choices. Thought has two meanings: (1 a thought or an idea, (2 or a mental process occurring in consciousness during thinking (Oxford Languages) \n2. We define the word \"every time\" to mean always or every time. For the sentence to be correct, this would mean that every time she had thought that the problem would be resolved, it came back bigger and larger. This doesn't make sense, so we can eliminate choice B as this option has uncultivated or plants that don't grow.\n3. In \"plants that didn't grow\" we can identify a couple plants that did not grow and may include some plants that didn't even grow in the first place. This means that the sentence means that all her plant problems never resolved. Choice C: Plants that are not yet grown, this phrase means that we are still seeing that plants are not grown yet. It would make us think that her problem is that she planted seeds but none of them grew. This means that if she thought she fixed the problem and it came back bigger, this could mean that she tried to grow a few more seeds, but they didn't even grow yet. We can eliminate choice C because it has the wrong idea of why the plants wouldn't grow.\n4. Plants that grew unhealth is not grammatical and would have different meaning depending on whether the verbs in the sentence are in singular or plural form. This option seems to be the most grammatically correct, but it doesn't mean that something that she thought was solved comes back bigger.\n5. \"Plants that were not maintained well\" is grammatically correct, and the sentence does make sense grammatically. But if we interpret it to the sentence to mean that it was a plant that the person thought she fixed the issue with and it came bigger, we would assume it was a large and overgrown plant.

The answer will refer to the past action that she did and why she didn't do. So, the choice cannot be \"she didn't go back.\"\n\nBecause, she decided not to buy the book. And, that the book was used. The question is what did she do with her life? Her life is in the past. So, the answer is C.

A: it was a successful act B: he lost his job C: he was dismissed by the higher ups D: he got a raise E: he got transferred\n\n    Rationales:\n\nIn order to answer this question, we must first understand the question. He said what he did \"was an act.\" This suggests that he did something. We need to determine what that action was. So far, we've eliminated Option A, \"successful act,\" as this is not a result, but rather another action that could happen before or after the act. Option B, \"he lost his job,\" is a possible result, but so are Options C, and D.\n\nOption B: He lost his job could mean he was fired, he resigned, etc. As we know, he did something (an act), so it's still important to determine what that something was that got him a new job.\n\nOption C: He was dismissed by the Higher-Ups could mean that he was demoted, given the boot, or something similar. If we knew what his original job was, we would know what his new job was, and we could find out which of these options was a positive or negative change.\n      \n      But that's not what we're asked, so we need to consider the other options left:\n      \n      Option D: He was transferred. This, like Option A, could be a positive or negative change, so we must determine the details of his current situation.\n      \n      If he was transferred to a higher role or pay grade, that's positive. If he was transferred to his current role/grade minus two dollars a week, that's negative.

This is not correct as the context clearly states that the individual is unsuccessful at growing plants. There is nothing \"not too green\" about this outcome, so this is ruled out.\nB. This can be ruled out as \"paper\" has nothing to do with plants and \"brown\" certainly is not a good description of a \"green thumb.\"\nC.

{"text": "would do. Choices:  A. plant B. garden C. vegetables D. eat raw meat E. fruits\nRationales: Start with interpretation. \"She sure didn't have any green thumb\" indicates that the person had difficulty growing and maintaining plants, suggesting they may have faced setbacks or challenges in this area. However, the phrase does not specify what \"she thought she would do,\" so we must assume that the answer has to do with planting and gardening, as that's the context in which the statement is made.\n\n1. Now, let's compare each of the answers. \n2. Plant: While one could technically grow plants in a garden, planting is more closely associated with sowing seeds in soil or ground. \n3. Garden: This is a common term for a place where plants are grown, as opposed to a kitchen or dining area where food is prepared and eaten.\n4. Vegetables: Eating vegetables is not inherently associated with gardening or planting, as one could also purchase them from a store or market.\n5. Fruits: Like vegetables, having a green thumb does not necessarily require one to grow or plant them, as they can be bought from a grocery store or market. \n6. Raw Meat: This option has some potential applicability as a phrase like \"she sure didn't have green fingers,\" which would refer to someone who excels at gardening or planting with delicate care and precision.\n7.

Other options may exist.\nRationales: First, we need to understand the grammar and format of the question. The phrase \u201cevery time she thought she plantED A plant\u201d does not use the correct phrase structure. According to the Oxford American Handbook For Writers and Editors, \"When an infinitive follows a subject, the object form of the third-person singular verb is used. For example, To see the movie costs $35.\" In other words, \"To see the movie costs $40\" would be correct. The same rule applies to \"thought.\" To complete the sentence correctly, the phrase \u201cshe thought she plantA [object]ed a plant\u201d would be appropriate.\nSo, the incorrect sentence is: \u201cShe sure didn\u2019t have a green thumb every time she thought she [verb]ed plantA [object]\u201d.\nNext, we need to carefully explore each option to determine which one makes the most logical sense as what happens \u201cevery time she thought [her verb]ed plantA.\u201d The sentence can be paraphrased as: \u201cIt happened that she didn\u2019t have a [green thumb] all the time, [plantA] had [other spots]\u201d In this way, the options 1-9 can be reviewed.

{"text": "could grow flowers, they would die. Choices:  A : she shouldn't be a doctor B: she is not good at growing flowers C: she could be a florist D: she should be a florist E: she should get rid of all plants\nRationales: First, let's understand the question as this might help us approach its answer. The sentence suggests that every time she grows flowers, they all die. This could be because she lacks experience or skills with gardening, or perhaps she doesn't care for her plants enough.\nNow, we can choose the best possible answer based on what is already known from the context. Option A: she shouldn't be doctor. This option doesn't fit well as a possible response since a doctor's knowledge and skills are related to their expertise in medical treatment and diagnosis, not gardening.\nOption B: she is not a good gardener. This could be the answer as her lack of experience growing flowers might be a reason her plants die frequently. However, the phrase suggests she thinks she is good at growing flowers, implying that she has some confidence in her abilities. This indicates she probably believes she can grow plants well in spite of her past experiences.\nOption C: she can be a florist. This is possible since a florist can grow and sell flowers, although it's not confirmed in this context that she does actually do so.\nOption D: she should be florist. This option is also possible since the lack of success in growing flowers does not necessarily require someone to stop trying completely, but could be a sign that they should consider changing their approach.\nOption E: she should get get rid of all plants. This is not the answer as it doesn't fit with the statement that she believes she can grow flowers well. It may be difficult to grow plants in certain environments, but believing that she can grow flowers successfully would not necessarily make her want to get rid of all her plants.\nTherefore, the answer is B : she is not good at gardening.\nAnswer: B : she is not a good at gardening", "answer": " 5250"}

However, it's important to consider the options carefully.\nStep 1: Considering the options, it's clear that the choices do not provide a solution, but rather reasons why the woman could not improve her gardening skills, indicating that the woman may already have a green thumb.\nStep 2: Hence, the woman does not need to pick up another hobby, as this would suggest she has other skills, which the options do not reflect.\nStep 3: Similarly, not applying fertilizer does not make sense as it is an essential element for gardening, and the phrase \" every time she thought she did good\" suggests the woman's efforts were making progress.\nStep 4: Picking up another hobby would not indicate she already has a good green thumb, and spraying bug spray is inconsistent with gardening, which is why this option is best eliminated.\nStep 5: Moving on to option C: Apply fertiliser. Although the phrase \"it would wither\" indicates a lack of success, it's possible that the application of fertiliser could improve the quality of her garden.\nStep 6: The question asks the woman to do something to improve her gardening, but the phrase \"applying the fertilizer to the wrong plant\" introduces the possibility that the plant could be changed, making it possible for the fertilizer to have the desired effect.\nStep 7: In conclusion, the phrase \"she would wither\" and the option \"plant in the desert\" suggest a problem with the current plant, and the options do not provide a solution.\nStep 8: Hence, the correct answer is A: Stop watering. Stop watering implies a new plant could be chosen to be planted in the desert as part of a new gardening attempt.

Grass (Choice B) is a type of plant, and is related to the greenhouse (Choice D), green thumb (Choice C), and pink thumb (Choice E), but if the green thumb is green (Option C), this makes no sense.\n2. Green plants (Choice A) are plants that are generally green in color, but if the user has a green thumb, this would imply that the plant is dead regardless of the color.\n3. The phrase \"every time\" also suggests that the intention was to plant plants (and not grass or other garden elements), so we can reject choice A: green plants and B: grass.\n4. The phrase \"withered\" implies that the intended plant died due to inaccurate planting by the user, so we can reject C: green thumb and D: greenhouse. \n5. Since the other choice (E: pink thumb) is not mentioned in the question, this is not the correct answer choice.\n6. It's important that we combine different details from each choice and rule out the ones that don't align.\n7.

{"text": "was watering them she would be watering what instead? Choices: 1: the floor 2: the table 3: the birdbath 4: the window 5: the planters\nRationales: The first step in answering the question is to understand and interpret the phrase \"she sure didn't have...\" which implies that she had attempted to nurture plant life in her environment, but had failed to do so. \nThe next step is to interpret the answer choices based on the metaphorical usage of the word \"watering\". Watering means to give appropriate and regular care and attention to (an object or activity). \nThe phrase \"her window\" could refer to the glass window, but it doesn't make sense that she would be giving \"attention\" to the glass. \nThe phrase \"planters\" refers to containers designed to hold or cultivate plants or flowers. Planters could be watered, but they are also planted, meaning they are not being watered as often as they need to be. \nThe phrase could be referring to the table, but it does not make logical sense. She would only be watering the plants and flowers if she placed them in the planters.\n1. Option 1: The floor is ruled out because of the \"table\" option. The window could not be seen as a watering option because watering would give attention to the plants in the planters, not the birds.\n2. Option 2: The table is the answer, as the phrase \"the planters\" gives credence to the idea that any watering would be directed to the plants in those containers (planters), meaning a table that had the ability to water plants or flowers.\nAnswer = 2: The Table is the correct answer.

{"text": "was smart, she always messed it up. Choices:  A : yellow B: red C: orange D: purple E: white\nRationales: To answer this question well, it's vital to understand the meaning behind the text.\nFirst, consider how to define \"green thumb.\" One dictionary defines it as \"the ability to grow good plants, especially to take care of plants successfully, or to use your hands well.\" It implies that a person with a green thumb can raise and care for plants well.\nSince she may not be successful in gardening, the person in the question would also be unlikely to have a green thumb, a trait associated with success in gardening.\nBased on the information in the sentence, we can conclude Option A:Yellow is a correct answer choice. \"Orange\" may be a metaphor for failure, but it does not describe a color that is specifically associated with gardening.

Choices:  A) did not do enough to nourish the plant B) plant was too cold C) plant was not watered enough D) plant was in the wrong place E) plant was a poorly chosen type of plant\nRationales: This question is asking us to choose the answer that best fits the sentence's meaning. Here are some steps that we need to take to answer the question. \n1. The question asks about which one of the answer choices is most likely to be the reason for the failed plantings. \n2. The given facts mention that the woman did not have a green thumb. \n  1. This fact could be interpreted in many ways, and so the question asks for our interpretation. \n3. Now consider each option: \n  * Option A) did not do nourishing the plant. This is not a plausible option, as it would be expected that the woman would try nourishing the plant, before giving up.\n  * Option B) Plant was too cold. It's possible that the plant wouldn't be able to survive the cold temperatures, but it's also possible that the woman was just not aware of how to properly grow a plant in cold temperatures.\n  * Option C) plant was not being watered enough. This is a possibility, but it's hard to believe that the woman would not even try watering the plant before giving up.\n  1. Although the plant was probably not watered enough, it's more likely that the lady just wasn't adequately experienced in growing plants, rather than simply not attempting.\n  * Option D) plant was in wrong place. This is plausible as it would be expected for the lady to try different placements of the plant before completely giving up.\n  \n4. Option E) plant was a bad choice. It's hard to believe it's the plant that is to blame, so this option is not likely.\n  \n  * Option E) is a possible answer, and so this is the one most likely to be right. \nAnswer: E) was a bad choice. \n\nInput: What can help you improve your memory?

This suggests something is preventing the garden from thriving or looking its best.\n8. Black is the color that typically indicates something is not growing well in a garden. Considering this, the correct answer is B: mold.\nAnswer: B. mold\n\nInput: If you plan a surprise party, how does that person get there? Choices: A: drive B: walk C: take a bus D: take an airplane E: ride a horse\nRationales: Understand what the question asks. The answer should focus on the transportation of the person who is the recipient of the surprise party, as this is a key element in planning a surprise party.\n7. Consider each of the given choices.\n6. Option A: drive. The sentence does not indicate if the surprise party is for an individual or for a group of people. If a group of people is being surprised, the individual may not be the one getting there by their own means.\n5. Option B: walk. This option is excluded from the list.\n4. Option C: take a bus. Considering the nature of the surprise, taking the bus may not be the best option, as the destination may not be accessible or accessible by public transportation.\n3. Choice D: take an airline. This makes sense initially, as flying may be the most popular option for traveling long distances, but the sentence does not state if the individual is planning to go far or whether other available modes of transportation is viable.\n2. Option E: ride a horse. As the sentence does not state the travel distance, horseback riding may not be realistic, and the option is excluded.\n1. The best choice is C: take a bus, as this is the most likely option given the information provided in the sentence.\nAnswer: C.

There are two possible choices, A and B. A is \"The warriors\" and B is \"Their opponents.\"\nSecond, we have a choice of what type of fighting is used. There are five choices A, B, C, D, and E.\nA, metal, and D are all fighting weapons. C and E are neither fighting weapons nor part of the subject, so we can eliminate them.\n1.

D\nRationales: The phrase \"She sure didn't have any green thumb\" implies that she failed to nurture and grow a healthy rose plant in her garden. It refers to her lack of success and ability to grow healthy plants in her garden. \n1. \"Every time she thought she water the roses\" is a sentence pattern that suggests that she mistakenly believed she was watering her rose plants but ended up killing them instead.\n2. The \"green thumb\" refers to someone who is successful in gardening or is highly skilled at it, while a \"red thumb\" would refer to someone who is inexperienced or unsuccessful in gardening.\n3. In this case, the phrase \"She sure didn\u2019t have a green thumb\" is not referring to her actual hand color, but rather to her inability to grow healthy roses.\n4.  \"A.C. B. D. C.\" is a phrase used to refer to a variety of items, including AC, beer, and CDs, which make the meaning unclear.\n5. The correct phrase is \"A. C. B. D.\" where \"A\" refers to Air Conditioning, \"C\" to Chocolate, \"B\" for Beer, and \"D\" for Dog. The four items are organized in order of increasing alphabetical value, followed by their respective initial letters.\n6.

{"text": "needed a good time they gave her the same things by the bucket. Choices:  A. lunch B. flowers C. food D. vegetables E. lemon\nRationales: First, understand the question: She \"sure didn't have a... green thumb\" means she wasn't skilled or adept at cultivating plants.  The person is trying to figure out what to give her to make her feel better, and has come up with a list of things she already receives. The answer should be something she could use to feel happier or better, and not something she already has.\n\nStep 1. Analyze each option carefully. (The options are: Lunch, food, vegetables, flowers, and lemon).\n\nOption A: Lunch \n- No, she wouldn't love it, since she already has it.\n- She would receive it multiple times.\n- Not something she's interested in or something she'd prefer to receive more often.\n\nOption B: Flowers \n- No, flowers make her unhappy, as they remind her that she isn't capable at gardening plants.\n- She doesn't want more of flowers, since she wants happiness, not reminders of unhappiness.\n\nOption C: Food \n- She wouldn't like it if she still receives lunch.\n- Not something that would help improve her current situation or improve her quality of life overall.\n\nOption D: Vegetables \n- No, too many vegetables would make her unhappy even more and she wouldn't actually like it.\n\nOption E: Lemon \n- No, again, she doesn't want another sad thing in her life, and lemons are not fun to get or receive.\n\nStep 2: We can rule out each option based on reason 1 or reason 2.

{"text": "would grow a flower, we found a cactus. What did she do? Choices: 1: Cut down plants 2: Leave room plants 3: Water plants 4: Prepare ground 5: Cut down plant\nRationales: Let's go through this in steps:\nStep 1: First, understand the question and the context. She sure didn't/doesn't have a green the meaning of this is \"a person can't garden/grow plants\".\nStep 2: Second, determine the options of what a person could do that'd improve or at least make them more proficient at gardening. To help we can also note that this person's gardening skills are so bad that even trying to plant flowers results in a cactus. We can therefore deduce that whatever is needed to get a person's gardening chops up will either not be possible or will require quite a bit of work in order or effort, meaning that one should try and choose something that doesn't require a lot of extra work or exertion.\nStep 3: Next, cross-examine the options and their merit. Cross-examine is a process where one uses two or more sources of information/evidence (like this post and the answer choices) to arrive at a conclusion. Cross-examines can also be used to look for information not provided in the answer choices. This way, one can arrive at the best option or alternative option.\nA. Cut down plants -- This is likely. The meaning of cut down is to reduce something and can also mean to abolish entirely. Here, this is the first clue that the person can't garden as planting is in their control so their inability to garden is likely to be caused (not only by) their skill, which would then likely mean that the person cannot garden. This is most likely to be true as the other options are less likely to be able to cause or be caused by a person's skill, except one.\nB. Leave unplanted plants -- Here, the literal meaning of leaving unplanted plants is leaving them be without watering them or caring for them, but the question doesn't ask what the person did and instead provides a problem afterward, so we can interpret this as the person in question leaving or leaving up planted plants.

I don't think there is a way to help the plants if she can't control the squirrels. Plus, squirrels ate the plants, if not the plants were frozen. Therefore A and B are not related to her situation in any way. \nNext, let's continue this line of thought.

If not, let's see what can go wrong. \nFirst, I don't think D is the correct way to go, since it's stating her plants died.  In this case it doesn't make sense. Also there is no option to try and help if her plants die in an unusual way.

We need to understand the underlying reasons for this behavior, which are likely to be associated with the person's character qualities, personal traits, or motives.\n3. Starting from choice A: this choice is unlikely to be the correct answer as it doesn't give any indication of the person's behavior or motivation for not having a green thumb. \n4.

It could be applicable if a person tried to cultivate some seeds but lost interest because they didn't germinated.\n5. Choice C: this choice is also not likely to be the correct choice.

The sentence is more describing a case where she was trying but failing, not one where she was trying and succeeding. \n9. \"something she enjoy\" - This doesn' enjoy withering, so it is unlikely that she would be \"enjoying\" anything when the plant would wither. \n10. \"C she was never on when it came to\" - The phrase \"she was never on\" suggests that something was not happening here.

{"text": "would grow a tree the plant would die. What color should she wear? Choices: \nA: white B: red C: black D: violet E: yellow\nRationales: A: white - no correlation with answer. B: red - does not make sense, because if she's bad at growing things, she would want to wear something else, not red - her favourite colour! C: black - not a good colour for her to wear as it's generally associated with death - but, if she has bad luck with plants or growing things, she should wear something different - this is not about her personality - so the options of black and white - do nothing. This means the option should be black in the last position, and since it doesn't make any sense, C is out. D: violet - does not make sense - a nice shade of purple, but not a great choice for her clothes, so, this option is out. E: yellow - does not make sense but it is not an option, because it's not a good idea to wear a yellow dress, or shirt, if you are afraid of being poisoned by plants and flowers. This leaves us with a choice between A: white and B: red. B: red. Now, if the sentence is correct, it should say 'every time she would grow a tree', not 'every time she thought she would'. It should also say 'She sure couldn't grow', but as it's the girl that's asked what colour, I can see why it'd say she wouldn't grow. This means that the right answer is B: red as she sure couldn\u2019t grow a tree every time she thought she\u2019d grow a tree. Now, if the last sentence really reads 'every time she would think she would grow a tree' then it should not be B: red, but red.

We're looking at whether a person has this characteristic, not what they are holding in their hands. \nIII. Answer choices: 1. A green thumb is not the answer because it's referring to a person's ability to grow a garden that is typically green and thriving. This person is unable to do so, as the gardens they grow die.\n2. B: the greenhouse. This is not the answer because the character cannot successfully keep the gardens they planted, this question asks about whether they have a \"green thumb\".\n3. C: the rain and sun. This is not the possible answer because the character cannot plant a garden and keep it alive and thriving. \n4. D: the rainbow. The rainbow is a sign of the end of the storm, implying that green grass could grow. However, this is not what we're looking for in this context. \n5. E: the seeds and gardens. This is not the correct answer because it's about the ability to have a green thumb, not the items related to growing a garden. \n6. therefore, the correct answer is B: green thumb.\nAnswer: B(green thumb)\n\nInput: What are these for, things around the house to prevent someone from going near your home?

{"text": "had gotten a plant to grow well, it died. Choices:  A. no thumb B. couldn't C. not a plant D. plant E. dead\nRationales: First, understand the question and the relationship of choices to the question. The person is asking about a \"green thumb\", which is a metaphor, so it's important to understand its meaning. A \"green thumb\" is an ability to care for plants, to ensure they grow and thrive.\n1. Choice A: no thumb (No A). Green thumb is a metaphor for a certain skill, which is why we're considering what it means. If you don't have a thumb, obviously it won't be a meaningful metaphor anymore and the question is irrelevant.\n2. Choice B: couldn't (no B). This doesn't imply anything to do with the metaphor, as this choice doesn't convey any meaningful information.\n3. Choice C: not a plant (no plant (C)). \"Plant\" does not represent a part of the metaphor of thumb, so if it does not match it, it cannot represent an option.\n4. Choice D: Plant (D). Again, this doesn't make much sense as it does not convey any information about thumbs, only about plants.\n5. Choice E: Dead (E). The question's focus is on being able to get a plant to grow well (no idea what it means by \"well\" but that's irrelevant for the question). If every time the person tried to improve the condition of a plant, it died, that surely means that he or she does not have a green thumb and that the plant died, right? So if Choice E is accurate, what is Choice C? \"Not a plant\" is the correct answer choice.\n\nInput: I was getting my hair cut, and what did we end up using?

{"text": "was watering a plant, it would die. What did she think she was watering? Choices: A: garden B: flower pot C: rosebush D: lawn E: tree\nRationales: In this question, the meaning of \"watering a plant\" is relevant in determining the correct answer. The answer choices can all be interpreted as things that need to be watered, but only one of the answers refers to the literal meaning of watering a plant. 1. The first option A: garden. While a garden can be watered with a garden hose or watering can, this answer does not make sense in the context, as the speaker only needs to be watering a plant, which implies it's an individual living plant.\n2. Option B: flower pot. While a flower pot needs to be watered, the speaker in the question did not specifically say that she was watering a flower pot, which means that this answer should not be treated as a plausible solution. 3. Option C: rosebush. While a rosebush needs to be watered as well, this is not an applicable solution as a rosebush can also be watered with a hose or watering bucket when planted in a pot or planter. 4. Option D: lawn. While a lawn can be watered with different techniques, this does not apply to the context of the question because the word \"lawn\" is too general and does not indicate that the speaker is specifically watering a plant.  5. Option E: tree. While a tree needs to be watered with mulch, soil, ground water, or rain, it does not fit in the context because the speaker specifically mentions that she is thinking that she is watering a flower and says that \"every time she thought she was doing it, it would die.\"\n6. Therefore, since none of the choices seem plausible, the answer should be a word that does not have anything to do with watering a plant and cannot be used in general. In other words, the answer is E, which means nothing.  Answer: E: Nothing \n\n### Input: He decided to sell the farm, he was tired. what is he called?

Choices:  A garden B gardener C plants D green B C D\nRationales: First, let's consider if any of the answer choices are implied by the phrase \"she sure didn't have\". It implies that she doesn't possess the qualities of a person who is experienced or has aptitude in gardening, indicating her lack of ability in caring for plants. We can now consider each option.\n1. A: garden - this is not related to the phrase we are given. If anything, the phrase \"didn't have a green\" implies the person doesn't have a green garden.\n2. B: gardener - a gardener is a person who cares for plants and gardens, so this definition applies to the statement above.\n3. C: plants - similarly, this option fits with the phrase \"thought she cared\" because it implies she tried to care for them but failed.\n4. D: green - it doesn't make any sense that a person cared for plants that died and they weren't green. It suggests the plants died because of her lack of care and negligence, making \"lack of ability\" the most likely answer here.

It is the correct answer since it exceeds the maximum capacity by 100 or 40 kg.  \n2. It does not have the capacity to lift 200, as it is limited to 200/2 or 100 kg. \n3.

{"text": "planted flowers, they died. Choices:  A : flower B : herbs C : garden D : vegetables E: tomato\n\nRationales: Understanding the question requires paying attention to the specific details. The phrase \"She sure didn't have\" implies that she did not possess the knowledge, skills, attitude, or resources needed to maintain planted flowers. \nShe thought she planted flowers implies that she assumed she had planted flowers, which indicates that she had no actual confirmation. \nThis information leads us to consider only the actual situation: every time she planted flowers, the plant died.\nThis suggests that the problem isn't just a lack of knowledge. It's a direct issue with the plant and how the person was handling plants in general. \nBased on the information stated, only the option \"Herbs\" (Choice B) makes sense.\nOther options do not match the phrasing required for the question. Choice A (flowers) is not explicitly stated to have died, while Choice C (garden) is too general and not specific to plants. Choice D (vegetables) is too vague to be relevant as well. \nChoice E (tomato) is a type of plant, but not a vegetable, and not a flower either.\nTherefore, the best answer is Choice B: herbs, which match the details stated in the question.\nAnswer: B : herbs\n\nInput: This person is happy, what is making them happy?

K: brown\nRationales: First of all, let us explain what the phrase \"the person you are talking to has a green thumb\" means. A 'green thumb' is an idiom meaning gardening skill. Therefore the phrase can be interpreted as, \"the person you are describing has gardening skill.\" The next step is to figure out what the answer choices mean. They are the colors the thumb appears to be. We can eliminate any choices that make no sense. In this case, only choice 'K: brown', making brown the color of the thumb, doesn't make sense as a response to'she doesn't have a green.' The phrase means \"she doesn't have any skill when it comes to gardening', not that her thumb is brown.

A: green hands is incorrect as \"hands\" is not typically used to refer to the color of the skin.\n2. B: green brain makes little sense. The meaning of the words doesn't necessarily align with the sentence's intent.\n3. C: green lips is likely not the intended meaning. It's more related to the color of a person's mouth.\n4.

They had been tied 2-2 in the last two minutes Choices:  A B: A: a draw\nC: C: a win\nD: D: a loss\nE: E: a tie\nRationales: We can start with option A and eliminate some options.\n1. A doesn't make much sense as a possible outcome if they lost last night.\n2. Eliminate option B with the same logic.\n3. Option D has no bearing on tie, draw, or loss, so we can eliminate it as well.\n4. We have the option of E, a tie.\n5. We can then verify the other options are also incorrect.\n6. We can consider option C, which makes sense as we had been tied 2/2 in the last two games.\n7. We then have the choice of either A or C, but as they must choose one or the other, we can eliminate option C. \n8. This leaves us with answer A: tie as it's the only choice left.\nAnswer: A.

{"text": "grew a flower what did she? Choices: \nA: chocolate bar  B: 18 inches  C: weeds  D: a flower  E: carpet\nRationales: First, try to understand what the speaker is trying to communicate. There are certain words and phrases that may offer clues as to the intended meaning, such as, here, that, sure, but, the, a, it, I, will, think, grow, and had.\n1. Let's use one of the clues (here) to define the question type. This means, to interpret the question, we need to consider both the literal meaning and the figurative meaning. For example, had she grown a flower or not? This is a common question type for figurative language, where an action is done without actual results, or intent not manifested.\n2. Consider the four options (A: chocolate, B: inches, C: weeds, D: flower and E: carpet).\n3. Starting with the literal meaning, chocolate is a food, while weeds are plants, so these are not good answers.\n4. Moving to the meaning that fits the metaphor, we see \"didn't have a green/successful thumb,\" here 18\" stands for the inches and not the length, and a flower has green/successful plants, so they fit the metaphor nicely. So let's check the figurative meaning once more.\n5. Considering the possible results of burning a green thumb or failing to have one, a figurative meaning would be related to not growing a flower or not being able to grow one. Therefore, answers C, D, and E do not satisfy this interpretation.\n6. The last one, A: 18 inches, does fit both meanings. It's a literal meaning and a \"not-to-grow\" metaphor, so A:18\" is the answer.\nAnswer: A; 18\"\n\nInput: He said it was 60 degrees what is it? Choices:  N: the temperature  O: the number  P: what year  Q: a letter  R: it's 60 degrees\nRationales: The first step is to analyze the structure and meaning of the phrase.

{"text": "had the flowers growing, they would wither; so, she took them out. They are yellow. What did she do to them? Choices: 1. A: plant them 2. B: kill them 3. C: buy them 4. D: water them 5. E: place them in the garden \nRationales:\n1. We look at the problem to find the word she should replace. From the context, I can make out that she must have done something to the flowers.\n2. If I replace a phrase with a different word, I must test it to see if the sentence is still grammatically correct.\n3. Since the problem states that she did something to the flowers, and we want to find out if we used the correct word, we must test our options against the problem.\n4. I must now choose the answer that fits the problem best.\n5. We start by testing option A) plant them. If she planted them, surely there is a good reason why they wouldn't survive, such as in bad soil or poor conditions. So, I must use the answer with the least reasons for the plant to fail, thus I use the greenhouse flower, the one with the least reason to wilt.\n6. The next step is simple, I cross out the word that doesn't fit and replace it with the one that does. In this case, I can cross out the word kill, because the gardener did not kill the flower and cross out the word plant, because she couldn't survive there.\n7. Finally you can see that the only option that makes sense is the last word, \"place them in the garden\" because that is what you would do with a garden herb when it wilted, you bring it in the greenhouse and place it in the cold room (the refrigerator).\n8. So, the green thumb is the gardener or it is the gardener, who is the one who watered the flowers, not the plant, but the garden, which is why she said: every time she thought she would water the flowers, they would die.\n9. So, we have the correct answer, place them in the garden.\n\nInput: Is it true that the more one does something, the more comfortable they become at it?

Choices: 4. A: Terrorists 5. B: Thieves 6. C: Rebuilding 7. D: Tornado 8. E: Hurricane\nRationales: Choices B, C, and D are eliminated because tornadoes and hurricanes do not change skylines. The word \"rebuilding\" in option C also indicates a long-term change and is not what is implied in the phrase, \"it was on the news.\" Option F: \"thieves \" is also used in a way that gives the incorrect impression of a short-term change, even if a thief does steal items that constitute skylines. \nChoice A: \"terrorists \" could be short-term, like a hijacking.

{"text": "watering the plants? Choices:  D: overwatered,  A: didn't water, C: watered too much, B: didn't water enough, E: did too much repotting\nRationales: First, it's important to understand what the phrase \"every time\" is implying. It suggests that the person was not watering the plants adequately, indicating that each time was a failure. \nNext, consider what you need to know about plants in order to answer the question. One key factor in maintaining healthy plants is watering. Watering too much can lead to overwatering, which can cause the plants to die. Likewise, not watering enough can lead to underwatering and eventually drying out the plants. \nNow, consider the answer choices and determine which one fits the phrase and the given information. \nIf each time the person watered the plants, they did not water enough, this would imply that the plants died. So, the person likely wouldn't consider the plant to have a green thumb. \nIf each plant didn't have a chance to grow healthy because of poor watering, the person likely would not consider themselves to have a green thumb after all. This is a key consideration in answering the question.\nNow, consider each answer choice:\nD: overwatered : Overwatering plants is a valid response but would not result in the plants dying. It may cause them to be unhappy or less healthy, but it would not mean the person lacked a green thumb if she watered poorly. \nA: didn't water This implies that the person did not water the plant at all. If the plant didn't get any water, it would likely die.\nThus, the person would probably not consider themselves to have had a green thumb.  There may have been one particular plant she thought she was watering often that died, but it would have been due to lack of water and not overwatering.\n\nThis leaves C: watered too often and E: did too much potting. If the person watered the plant too often, the plant wouldn't likely die since watering could be done with care, but the plant may become unhappy, as overwatering is not healthy. \nIf the person did too much repot, this means that the plant may have received the proper amount of water", "answer": " 100"}

The correct choice is A: \"green thumb\" means you have a natural ability to grow plants, and a person who is unable to grow anything would not have a \"green thumb.\"\n2. \"No thumb\" doesn't make sense, as a thumb is used to perform this task.\n3. \"A thumb\" and \"a bad thumb\" both make sense, but a \"bad thumb\" does not imply the ability to grow anything.\n4. \"Good thumb\" would not mean the ability to grow anything, but it fits with the idea of \"green thumb.\" \n5.

Choices:  B emergency room C clinic D doctors office E health center\nRationales: The question asks where a patient would be treated if they have a cough and flu-like symptoms, which typically indicates an illness caused by a virus or bacteria. \n1. It's important not to assume the location is a hospital. While clinics and health centers can be a potential option, they are typically smaller and may not be equipped to handle serious illnesses. \n2. The only location listed in the options that meets the criteria of a hospital is choice E: \"health center.\" \n3. Clinics typically specialize in specific areas of health care, such as diabetes or nutrition, while health centers provide a more comprehensive range of healthcare services. \n4.

{"text": "was doing a good job it turned out to be bad. Choices:  A. Green thumb B. Yellow  C. Black D. Red E. Blue\nRationales: The first step is to read the phrase \"She sure didn't have\", which implies that the speaker was mistaken or did not understand something. That mistake happens to be related to green thumbs. The second step is to determine the exact nature of that misunderstanding. \nThis can be done by starting with the choice A: green thumb, which isn't the appropriate label for a person who doesn't have a gardening talent. We can cross out this option as it doesn't fit the rest of the phrase. \nMoving on to B: yellow, we can see that it's not the right answer as some people might associate it with other traits, not green thumbs. \nC: Black, is another common trait, but it won't fit the context of this question. D: Red and E: Blue are similarly inappropriate as they don't refer to gardening skills. So there is a strong chance that the answer is not any of the listed answers.\nNow, taking this into account, we move on to the actual question. What happens every time when someone thinks they're doing a good job? And what happens when they think they're doing a bad job? Someone might say they're doing a great job, thinking it would be an encouraging remark and then get an unexpected negative feedback. \nThus, what we can extract from this can be summed up as: She thought she was doing a garden, but every time it turned out to be a bad garden.\nThe best option would be a word that fits this scenario the best, such as: frown, grimace, and glower.

Consider each option with respect to the idea of a green thumb.\n3. Option A, \"plant them a different way,\" may lead to better results depending on the exact method, but it's vague and unlikely to help with the issue at hand.\n4. Option D, \"Make sure the soil was really good.\" It does not answer the question directly.\n5. Option C, \"Buy different kinds of flowers,\" may solve the problems, but it's still not really relevant to the question of having a green thumb.\n6. Option E, \"Water it daily,\" is more likely to be the appropriate answer as it is specific and relevant to the green thumb question.\n7. \"Watering\" helps keeps plants alive and healthy, making it a potential solution for the problem of having a green thumb with the plants constantly dying.\n8. \"Watering daily\" is the most specific and accurate answer as it details the specific method that is needed to keep the plants alive and maintain a green thumb.\n\nAnswer: E: Water it daily\n\nInput: What did they give the cactus if it needed nourishment and needed to be watered every day during the week?

{"text": "was growing plants she was really eating what? Choices: \nA: dirt B: pots C: plants D: dish soap E: dishes\n\nRationales: Follow these steps to get the right answer. 1. Consider the words in the sentence that require answers. \"Every time\" indicates repetition, so the answer must be a past tense.\n2. We think of what the plants, soils, and pots are, and consider what they would be made of.\n3. Starting from the last possibility, dishes, is likely the wrong answer because the plants would be made of soil.\n4. Dish powder (dish soap) is a common cleaning agent, but this phrase does not reflect its use, meaning there's no need for it here.\n5. Dirt, pots, and plant could all be cleaned with water, so we're unlikely to need dish soap.\n6. Soil can also be cleaned with water or planted with plants, so this isn't relevant. Thus, we can look at other options.\n7. That leaves us with pot and plants. Plants do not need dish soap, but pots usually contain dirt that would absorb the dish soap and cause unwanted side effects.\n8. So the answer is D: Dirt, which would have received dish soap in the process.\nAnswer: D. Plants absorb soil, thus needing cleaning with water.\n\nInput: The store had no cashier for what?

Now, consider each of the remaining options. Option A: Grocery store. Grocery stores are locations where one goes to purchase food and related items. These products are typically paid for with money, not checks or credit cards. Therefore, choice A is likely incorrect.\n3. Option B: Bank.

{"text": "was doing good with her plant her plant? Choices:  C: leaves A: stems B: roots E: droops D: dies\nRationales:\n1. To understand the question, we must first decipher the \"she\", \"with\", and \"her\" in the question. \n2. \"She\" is a single lady, not an \"it\", \"they\", or \"we\".\n3. \"With\" refers to the plant itself and \"her\" refers to the single lady. \n4. We can immediately remove options A, B, D, and E. \n5. Option E: droops is also not correct as a single lady does not drop plants; it's a plant that droops by itself due to the lack of care and water.\n6. Option B: roots could be related to plants and caring for them but \"thought\" and \"was doing good\" rule them out when we compare the alternatives to the given context.\n7. Therefore the correct option is: C: leaves.\nAnswer: C. Leaves\n\nInput: What do you call a person who is too busy looking at and responding to texts? Choices:  B: focused C: preoccupied D: obsessed E: distracted F: addicted G: dependent H: glued\nRationales: The sentence refers to a specific type of behavior or state of mind. \nSo, the question seeks the common name or term for this state of mind. 1. Choices A, B, C, and H need to be eliminated. 2. Choices D and F are not related to texts since texts do not cause an addiction to technology or dependence on a device. Choice F could refer to a person who is addicting to technology. This behavior is not necessarily always associated with texting. 3. Choices E and G do not seem to fit the question as the answers refer to emotional involvement and not the usage of technology and phones in particular. 4.

{"text": "had a good garden, it was overgrown. Choices:  A. overgrown B. brown C. wilted D. green E. yellow\nRationales: The question asks us to identify what kind of thumb the person did not have. \nOur first step is to eliminate the incorrect answers. We can begin by eliminating choices we know are not relevant or related to gardening. \nA, overgrown - the person doesn't have a green, healthy thumb, but the word \"overgrown\" doesn't describe a thumb or a garden. \nB, brown - this choice is related to plants and gardens, but not to thumbs. \nD, green - although the opposite of green is yellow, this choice doesn't describe a lack of a thumb.\nE, yellow - this choice describes a different shade of color, although if the opposite of yellow is green, that could be a possibility. However, it may not be the intended meaning. \nOnce we've eliminated these choices, we can consider the rest. \nChoices left: Overgrown (Choice A), wilted (Choice B), and green (Choice E)  \nA and E don't seem like likely answers. \nThe reason for this is that if a thumb is overgrown, that means it's bigger and not smaller. \nThe opposite of overgrown is wilted. A wilted thumb would be smaller than normal. \nThe opposite for green and yellow is the opposite of red.\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wilted thumb. \nAnswer: B.

Green cauliflower is usually a very rare occurrence in the grocery store and is not likely to be confused with a tomato or lettuce. Finally, option D: Lettuce. Lettuce generally has a distinct color that does not change to green no matter how long you leave it in the refrigerator. Therefore, she must have been offering grapes, bananas, or pears.\nOption E: Gummy worms is unlikely as it does not fit with the context.\n\nNow, there are two remaining options: Grapes and Bananas.

{"text": "made a garden grow, it would wither by morning. What type of job could be found in this? Choices: 1. A: landscape architect 2. B: gardener C: nurseryman D: gardener E: florist\nRationales: The question asks us to identify the possible job that applies to this situation. 1. Starting with choice A, a landscape architect designs and plans for the design of landscapes, including gardens, but the key characteristic of this answer is \"every time she thought she made [a garden], it would wither by [morning\"\". The withering could be linked to a seasonal change or environmental conditions, but is more likely due to gardening skills and the gardener's lack of experience and expertise. Therefore, we can eliminate Landscape architect as a possible answer.\n2. Now considering choice B: gardener. This profession does not necessarily indicate expertise or experience, while our sentence implies the opposite. In fact, the phrase \"would wither [the next] morning\" states the opposite, that the gardener was incapable of preventing the withering. Therefore, we can also eliminate Gardener.\n3. The next set of options is the group of gardeners, florists and nurserymen. We can immediately eliminate nurseryman, as the phrase \"with a green thumb\" references a person being bad at gardening, while nurserymen are skilled, experienced gardeners.\n4. Now choose between florist and gardener. While a florist is a flower gardener, florists are often skilled at their craft and would not be impacted by a \"green thumb\" in the same way a gardener with a \"green thumb\" is expected to be. Because we're looking for someone who isn't skilled and is unable to prevent the plant withering, which is exactly what it implies about this character, gardener is again the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: Gardener", "answer": " 7"}

Instead, this phrase is related to botany, or the study of plants. \nThe question is referring to someone's ability to grow plants successfully or their green thumb, which is commonly associated with people that possess excellent plant-growing skills. \nFor this reason, A: plant is not a suitable answer option because it refers to growing plants in general, not to good plant growing skills. \nNext, C: wilted. A wilted plant is not connected to the knowledge of growing plants; it's a literal definition of a wilted plant. Therefore, this phrase is not the right fit.\nD: water. Water is important for plant growth, but it's a common practice for growing plants. It cannot be considered the correct answer.\nE: planted.

This is somewhat unlikely given the context of the given statement. \nB: In the right place - This option seems to fit well for the context of the given scenario. It would mean that the person was not able to plant the plant in the correct place and kept moving it in an attempt to find a suitable location. \nC: Picked it out and planted it again - This answer option is somewhat ambiguous and does not indicate which step came first.

A: First, we analyze this sentence: \"She sure didn't have ______.\" This indicates that there needs to be a _______ somewhere in the answer choices. \n2. When eliminating Answer choices in this case, it's important to remember to focus on the question and the details provided in the text, like how many plants died and why. \n3. As we begin reading through the choices, we see two options that directly involve skills (a degree or a job) or tools (talent or a diploma): A, B, C, and D. \n4. Although these are valid options regarding what a person might not have, they don't fit the \"I thought I was doing something right but I was wrong\" context. \n5. Similarly, Answer Choices F, G, and H focus on skills, tools, or abilities, but the sentence about the \"green thumb\" tells us that the person thought they did something, so these options aren't relevant. \n6. We can eliminate half of the choices very quickly. The remaining choices now can be eliminated by focusing on what the text tells us, like how the person didn't have a talent or a diploma, so it's clear that they didn't have one of these. \n7. Therefore, option C: she sure didn\u2019t have a degree is the answer.\nAnswer: C. She sure didn't' have a degree\n\nInput: The employee was able to redeem the coupons, what did they save on?

{"text": "was winning it would die anyway.  Choices:  A green thumb B: a person with a green thumb C: a green hand D: all-natural grassroots movement E: healthcare\nRationales: The instructions say to write the answer that most likely matches the phrase \"She sure didn't have green thumb.\" \nSo, the first thing to do is examine what the word \"green thumb\" really means. It is not actually the hand itself that is green, and it is not an object. \nInstead, the phrase refers to someone who is proficient at gardening. Someone with a green thumb is a skilled gardener, and so they can use their knowledge and experience to care for living plants. \n\nNow that we understand the meaning of the phrase \"she had a green thumb,\" we can consider the answer choices. \nA: green thumb is a person with a green hand is not applicable as a meaningful answer, as it does not make sense. A person cannot have a green hand, and the phrase \"She sure had a green thumb\" emphasizes that the person was skilled with gardening. \nB. Green thumb is a person with skill at gardening.  Therefore, this is the correct answer. \n\nInput: Which could you wear that is similar to a dress? Choices:  dress, A: skirt B: suit, C: pants, D: blouse, E: coat\nRationales: This instruction asks what you could wear that is similar to \"a dress.\" \nStep 1: We try to break down the phrase and understand what dresses are. \nStep 2. We determine the most common clothes that could be considered similar to \"a dress\" and think of how we could apply this understanding to the possible answer choices.  \nStep 3. The dress is a skirt and a dress.  In the same way, we can say that pants are similar to the skirt as well as the dress. So, it is both an acceptable answer and the only answer that matches the literal meaning of \"like a dress.\"\nAnswer: Both Dress and Pants\n\nInput: In which of these places would you put your phone?

{"text": "needed it she didn't have any luck with that. Choices:  A. The grass  B. Her flower C. Her plant D. Her tree E. Her vegetables\nRational: 1. The sentence is trying to tell us that the subject of the sentence didn't have much success with her vegetables.\n2. For this type of question, the first step is to understand exactly what the sentence is trying to say for each answer. With this in mind, we've considered the answers: A. The grass - The plant being referred to is that of grass.  \n3. B. Her flower - The subject is referring to another flowering plant.  \n4. C. Her plant - This seems to relate to many plants growing within the same area or ecosystem.  \n5. D. Her tree - This would be the most specific answer, as the mention of \"her [the subject] tree, implies the reference is to a single particular tree.  \n6. E. Her vegetables - With \"her vegetables\", the subject is referring to a more specific kind of plant. This may not be referring specifically to something like a garden, but instead to a pot of vegetables, which a single person may possess. \n7. With the first 5 answers considered, and our own understanding of the question, it makes the most sense to answer: D.

We find out this is the same as \"what does one need to get the best out the best situation\" \n4. The following should be ruled out: water, sunlight, lotion, and nail clippers. \n5. Water and sunlight are elements that simply don't affect the quality of work. They have nothing to do with what one might need to be the best out of it.\n6. Lotions and nail clippers are not needed in order to get something the best out of a situation.\n7. With", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "might have got it right, it died. Choices A: the same B: same C: same green D: did not help E: not the same\nRationales: The question asks us to infer what happened to the girl from the description provided. The statement implies that the girl struggled with gardening, and that she could never seem to keep a plant alive. \nThe answer should be related to either plant care or gardening. \nOption A: \"the same\" refers to the fact that the girl's efforts never worked, so this is not the appropriate answer.\nOption B: In gardening, \"the same\" implies that the conditions and efforts remain the same. This is not the case for the girl, as every time she tried to care for a plant, it died. Therefore, option B: same can't be the correct answer.\nOption C: \"same\" is a common term to describe greenery in general. However, the statement does not relate to green in this context. Furthermore, \"same green\" sounds implausible when describing a person's efforts in gardening. Therefore, C: same green cannot be the corresponding answer.\nOption D: \"didn't help\" could possibly be the correct answer. However, the statement is not about her efforts not helping, it's about the fact that every time she tried, the plant died.

{"text": "was growing something to eat, she couldn't help but laugh at herself. Why? Choices: \nA: She enjoyed making people around her laugh B: She had grown plants in the past and they turned out badly C: Her plants needed special care and lighting D: She had a high sense of humor and enjoyed her own jokes\nRationales:\n1. The sentence includes the phrase \"every time she thought she was growi\", which implies that growing something was something she thought she could do.\n2. To correctly understand this phrase and the sentence as a whole, we need to consider the character's personality and qualifications.\n3. The only personality trait mentioned so far is a high sense of humor. This implies she enjoys making others laugh. This also means that the reason she laughs at herself when she thinks she's growing something is because her plants would likely not grow well. Therefore, to answer the question, you need to determine if laughter is caused by failing to grow plants or by laughing at her sense of humor.\n4. Her laugh is likely to be caused by her lack of green thumb, because she's often laughing at herself for trying to grow a plant, and then failing to do so.\n5. A: She enjoyed making other people laugh: This option seems to be the right one. She enjoys being the comic relief, but she's likely not very good at plant growth.\nAnswer: C, She had a high sense\n\nGiven the following two-digit numbers, determine if they are equivalent.\n1. Choice S: 12\n    - 12 and 24 are not equivalent, as when you add the thousands digits, it's still 12.\n- Choice Q: not applicable\n    - It's always safe to assume the options that don't have the right answer don't have the answer.\n2. Choice P: 46\n    - The addition of these numbers gives two digits that are equivalent to each other, 14.\n- Choice R: 37\n    - Adding a 00 digit to both sides does not result in two equivalent digits.

Alternatively, it could mean that she had poor luck or results with caring for plants. \n3. First, understand what the question is about. We're looking for what the person does to the plants. \n4. Option A: \"hurt it\" is not something that a person actively does in an attempt to make plants grow, so it's not relevant. \n5. Option B: killing it or destroying it. While this is a possibility, it's unlikely that the person is intentionally trying to kill the plants, so we can eliminate B. \n6. Option C: making it grow. This seems like a plausible answer choice as we're looking for something that a person is attempting to do to plants. \n7. Option D: helped it grow. This is possibly a suitable answer as we already know \"She sure didn'tdn't have the green,\" and it could imply that the person is helping to grow the plants.\n8. Option E: fed it water. This is not relevant as \"making it grow\" is the desired outcome of the action that the person takes.\n9.

{"text": "was growing something, what would it turn out to be? Choices: 1. A: plants 2. A: flowers 3. D: trees 4. D: shrubs 5.

This is further supported by what she is \"growing,\" which is plants in general, not specific kinds of plants such as fruits or vegetables. So, it's clear that she is not a master gardener.\nNext, consider each option one by one.\n\"A: plants\" \u2013 this is the most common thing one might grow in a garden, but it could also refer to a variety of plants, including those that may not be the best quality or that weren't intended to be grown. So, this might not be an accurate answer.\n\"A: flowers\" \u2013 this is similar to \"plants\" in that one can grow flowers in a garden. However, it is not the most common thing to grow and therefore may not be the correct answer.\n\"D: tree\" \u2013 while trees are commonly grown in gardens, they can also be grown in other environments, such as forests. They may also grow from seeds that have been dispersed, rather than specifically planted by the gardener.

A: plant B: pot C: soil D: gloves E: water\nRationales: Read the question carefully: She \"sure didn't have a *green* thumb\" so she can't have the green plant; it must be a regular one.\n1. A: plant. The question asks for an answer to the problem and not the answer to a question, so only the correct answer is relevant. It's not a plant, so A is incorrect. It must be a regular plant. A regular plant is not green, so it excludes choice C which needs to be rejected too.\n2. B: pot. A pot is another item that is used regularly for growing a plant in. If the girl had a green thumb, the pot would belong to a green plant. Since there's no green thumb, the green plant cannot be green, hence B must be discarded too.\n3. C: soil. It's the same as any other normal plant, the soil cannot be green. That leaves choice D, Gloves and E, water. D: Gloves is not part of a plant and does not belong to it, and E: water should be rejected because not every plant requires water. The correct answer is E.\nAnswer: E. water.

The first thing to notice is that the product must be the 150 cals product and the question asks about a specific number for the product. This would indicate that the choices are all relative to the chosen product. The choices should be about the product and not a reference to something else; if the choices are relative to the others products (for example, an increase in price for a product being a decrease for another), there should be a clarification that the question refers to a specific product.", "answer": " 2210"}

The phrase \"flower bloom\" or \"to bloom\" is a term frequently used to describe the process of petals and other parts of a flower fully expanding to reveal a full and complete flower.\n\n3. So understanding \"flower did bloom,\" we can understand that \"I thought\" refers to the person's actions and intentions in cultivating a plant or flower.\n4. 'thought she did bloom' suggests that the person imagined their efforts could result in a full and complete flower, showing signs of growth\n\n5. 'didn't have a green tumb' is similar to 'did not have a green thumb' which means the person did not possess the knowledge or talent needed to grow a successful garden or flower arrangement.\n\n6. to determine an appropriate answer, we must break down the question and focus on each word.\n\n7.

{"text": "understood how to grow something, it turns into what? Choices:  T: dirt B: water C: sun D: grass E: dust\nRationales: First, understand the question: She doesn't have a green (plant-growing) thumb, or her plant-growing skills are not good.\n1. Second, examine the answer options: T: dirt, B: water, C: sun, D: grass, E: dust. It's common to think of dirt, water, sun, and grass as things required to grow crops and plants. But in this case, the phrase \"it turns to\" makes the answer a negative outcome. When things turn to dirt, it means the growth process fails to take effect. Water is also associated with growth in the sense of supporting it, like greenhouses, but not necessarily in the way of creating it, so B is a bad option.\n2. Grass is a plant, but we already know the lack of a good green thumb can lead to failure of growing crops and plants, so it does not make sense as an answer choice.\n3. Similarly, choosing E: dust could work if you consider dust as a substance used in fertilizers and soil, but it is a substance associated with the deterioration of things, so the correct choice is E: dust.\n4. The right answer is E: dust. Every time it turns into dust, her crops and plants fail to grow, but this is often a result of poor attention and care, so it could be considered more aptly as a green thumb.\nAnswer: E \n\n### Check all your answers. \nInput: Who is a leader?

{"text": "might she would grow, what? Choices: \n  * A: flowers   \n  * B: broccoli   \n  * C: garden   \n  * D: cacti   \n  * E: beans\nRationales: First, we need to understand the meaning of the phrase \"She sure didn't havea green thumb\". This means that she was not skilled at gardening and had limited success in planting and raising flowers and plants. \nSecond, we need to identify which of the options below is the most likely thing to grow even if she tried her best. \nLet's start by eliminating some choices. \nA: flowers. Flowers are delicate plants and require specific care and attention to thrive. If someone is not talented or confident in gardening, it's highly unlikely that they will be able to grow and maintain flowers. Hence, A is ruled out. \nB: broccoli. Broccoli is a hardy vegetable that can grow in various conditions. It also needs less care and maintenance compared to other plants. Therefore, if someone is struggling with gardening or lacking a green thumb, growing broccoli is more likely. Thus B is not the answer. \nC: garden. The word \"garden\" is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but it makes sense in the context of \"she sure didn't have...\". The phrase \"gardening\" is used to describe the hobby or activity of growing plants and flowers, so it can be inferred that the person was probably not skilled in gardening and growing plants. \nHowever, this option doesn'tknowingly explain the phrase \"She sure wouldn't have a green thrower every time she thought she would grow...\" - it's unclear why she tried, but if we assume that she did, it may make sense that she wouldn't be skilled in gardening, considering that if she was skilled in gardening she would surely grow green thumb in the given time frame as she was \"trying to\" all the time and growing \"garden\" with success.  D: cacti. This is also an unreasonable answer, similar to option A. Cacti need specific environmental conditions to thrive, and caring for them requires specialized knowledge, requiring someone skilled or experienced in gardening, who most likely does not lack a green", "answer": " 64"}
{"text": "planted what would happen? Choices: \n A: plant itself B: die C: grow on side D: grow on top E: flower\nRationales:\n1. The first step when solving a question is to understand what the phrase \"thought she planted\" refers to. This refers to an action or event that the speaker thought would result in some consequence. However, the actual result deviates from the speaker's initial expectation. This is often referred to as having a green thumb - one who has the ability to grow plants well. \n2. The phrases \"didn't have a green Thumb\" imply that the speaker didn't expect a success. The question now asks us to identify what actually happened after the speaker thought they planted  something. We take each option:\n3. Planting itself: This could be a literal interpretation of the phrase \"she thought she planted.\" However, it doesn't fit the overall context and intention, which implies that the speaker thought they would succeed in growing a plant but didn't.\n4. Die: Although this could fit the metaphor as \"the green thumb\" represents growth and fertility, it's not the correct answer as it doesn't align with the expression \"she thought she plant\"ed.\n5. Grow on side: This is a possibility as there's no contextual evidence that points against this answer, but there's no confirmation that this is the actual outcome. We continue with the other choices.\n6. Grow on top: The plant may grow well, or the soil may be fertile, but this outcome doesn't necessarily mean having a green thumb. Therefore, it is unlikely this is the response the speaker expected.\n7. Flower: This is the intended outcome of gardening or growing plants. However, it doesn' t represent having knowledge and experience in plant care, as having a green thumb does. Also, this response doesn't fit the metaphor of growing a plant, indicating that having a green thumb is more than just the result of planting a seed correctly.\n8.

Choices:  February A: The summer B: February C: The winter D: The rainy season E: Spring season\nRationales: First, understand the question and the choices. The question asks us what they consider to be the name of the second month of the year.\n\n1. The first step after understanding the question is to eliminate the obvious false choices. We can eliminate 'February' and 'The winter' because \"February\" is the second month on the calendar of the year, and \"The winter\" is not considered to be the second month for the year.\n2. Looking at the remaining choices, we can eliminate 'The summer', because the month of 'July' is in the middle of summer. \n3. The other choices are all seasons, and therefore, we can eliminate 'Spring season' as well, because the season'spring,' which is from March to May, is only the 'ninth' month of the year. \n4. The season 'fall' or 'autumn' is after the month of 'September', which is also not considered to be the season of autumn or fall. \n5.

A: \"the best she could do\" implies that she was trying her best to grow a plant, which does not align with the evidence suggesting she didn't have a \"green thumb\" and always killed her plants.\n2. B: \"it was a weed\" implies that the plant was a natural pest, rather than something that was intentionally planted. This does not align with the question's context.\n3. C: \"it grew too tall\" implies that the plant grew too large and out of control, which does not align as the evidence suggests she always killed her plants. \n4. D: \"it kept falling over\" implies that the plant repeatedly collapsed or fell over because of its own weight, and was not being supported or watered properly which does not align as there is no mention of the plant collapsing in the question.\n5. E: \"it wilted\" implies that the soil or climate was dry or cold, which it says nothing about in the question. This does not align.\n6. The only remaining answer choice that aligns with the question's evidence is answer choice E: \"it willed\" indicating that the plant simply died, likely due to inadequate care. Therefore, this is the correct answer. \nAnswer: E: it killed it", "answer": " 220"}
{"text": "was planting onions she was instead planting what? Choices:  B: carrots C: peppers D: potatoes E: flowers\nRationales: First, a few notes: 1. The title of the riddle does not exactly follow standard structure and may cause some confusion. 2. The title states \"She\" but \"He\" is actually used in the last line. 3. We know that we're looking for something she thought was planting, but wasn't, this is not necessarily what would be termed green thumb. 4. The last line of the riddle indicates that \"She\" had \"surely\" made a mistake, thus the answer should clarify what that error was. 5. It's unlikely that \"She\" was trying to plant flowers, as flowers typically require specific types of growing conditions that would make it less likely that She was trying to grow any type of vegetables. 6. Some veggies and flowers are similar in color, so it could be possible that She was trying to plant flowers thinking they were herbs or greens. However, we've determined that \"She\" already made an error of some sort, so this should not be considered in the answer. 7. In terms of what each answer means, peppers and potatoes are both a type of vegetable, but potatoes are specifically of the plant Solanum tuberosum, and peppers are not a specific plant thus can't be a substitute. 8. Both carrots and green thumb are generally used in reference to someone who is capable in gardening. 9. By this logic, E: flowers or C: peppers should be selected. 10. The word \"onions\" is italicized, this is used to indicate that the riddle is meant as an answer to \"What is it?\" or \"What was it?\" a person asked about. So for this riddle, it is referring to something that is typically a vegetable but was mistakenly planted as a completely different type of vegetable.\n11. So the conclusion is that the correct answer is \"carrots\", since they are a type of vegetable that is typically mistaken for other types of vegetables like beets and radishes. \nAnswer: C: carrots or B: carrots\n\nInput: Name something you may not see in person.

We can know that she has had a green thumb before but has subsequently lost it.\n\nb. We can assume that she had a good relationship with gardening at one point, but this has since changed.\n\nc. We can know that whatever she is doing now with gardening is different or incorrect.\n\nd.

{"text": "did best, her plants would turn into what? Choices: 1: A: weeds 2: B: garbage 3: C: wood 4: D: paper E: petals\nRationales: The first step is to identify what we're asked about. We're given a phrase describing someone and their plants. They must have a green thumb, and every time they think they did their best, their plants turn into something else.\nStep 2: Now, we'll look at the answer choices and try to eliminate those that do not fit the description.\nStep 3: A: weeds. Plants do not turn into weeds.\nStep 4: B: garbage. This, again, does not work and is unlikely to be the answer.\nStep 5: C: wood. We could say that something can turn into wood, but it still does not represent a plant, so this is not our answer.\nStep 6: D: paper. Perhaps these are old petals that have died and now turn into paper when the plant decomposes. This does not really describe a plant turning into something else, though, so we can eliminate D.\nStep 7: E: petals. In essence, petals are just the flowers on a plant. If they were to turn into something else, we might expect it to be something similar, like another flower, but instead, we get petals. Because petals still form part of the plant, they do not represent the plants turning into something else, so E is not correct.\nStep 8: Going back to A: weeds. The phrase was \"her plants would turn into...\". Perhaps the plants only grow into weeds when certain conditions are met, but the question refers to some plant turning into something other than itself and not into weeds.\nTherefore, D: paper is the correct answer. We can eliminate the rest of the choices without much hesitation.\nStep 9: We are left with D: paper.

She didn't understand why she was supposed to do any of these things E. She realized if she was going to be successful at farming, she needed new shoes so she took a vacation in Hawaii\nRationales: The correct answer is C: she made sure it was fertilized, in dirt that has enough compost. The choice of phrase -  \"She sure didn't have...\" - strongly indicates that at least one thing she did was wrong and probably the only choice. All other choices are only partial fixes which wouldn't lead to a plant growing in the first place.

{"text": "was doing what was best for her, she ended up giving herself a what? Choices:  P: bad case of poison oak B: splinter C: spider bite D: migraine\nRationales: Consider the sentence carefully. This means that this individual is making decisions that are harmful to them, not that they are intentionally hurting themselves. So, to determine which answer describes a harmful decision, we consider the possible options and the context.\n1. First, P: bad case of poinson oak. Poisining oak is usually caused by contact with a plant or fungus, not by thoughts or decisions. So this option cannot be the best choice.\n2. B: splinter. A splinter is a small piece of an object, such as wood, that gets stuck in the skin, typically due to contact with a sharp or rough surface. It can be painful and can occur as a result of contact with a foreign object. It's not relevant to make a \"bad case of splinters\" intentionally, it's a common result of misfortunate contact or activity.\n3. C: spider bitem. A spider bite can be painful, but it is a reaction to a bite, not an intention. So, it's not a good fit.\n4. D: migraine. This is the correct answer because migraines are headaches that can be caused by various factors, including stress or environmental changes. So, a \"bad case of migraines\" is fitting in this context.

{"text": "planted a seed she pulled out nothing but a leaf, what is she? Choices: \nA: Gardener B: Farmer C: Herbalist D: Veteran E: Doctor\nRationales: She planted a seed, but only found one leaf instead:\n1. The farmer sows seeds and plants them, and is the source of food production; they do not plant a single plant and wait for another plant to grow out of it. Planting a seed is typically the work of gardeners as farmers do not sow seeds, but that might just be a regional difference.\n2. Herbalists make medicines and prescriptions out of plants. They study a plant and its properties, but they do not plant a seed and wait for another plant (leaves, flowers, or fruits) to grow out of it, they take the leaf and use it directly. Plants are rarely harvested and used raw as they should be cooked first. Their roots and seeds are also used to make medicine.\n3. The vegetative plant is the veteran. They use plants to make weapons or parts of weapons but that does not make them farmers.\n4. Doctors are well versed in botany and herbal medicine but they're not veterans.\n5. Finally, gardeners plant one seed and wait for another root, flower, leaf, or fruit to grow from it. Therefore, it's the easiest to eliminate everything but A: Gardener.\nAnswer: A, Gardener\n\nInput: What are the last two states that are east of Wisconsin? Choices: 1. A: West Virginia 2.

A: weeds B: flowers C: grasses D: bushes E: gravel\nRationales: The question asks us to fill in the blank in the sentence, and we need to recognize which plant the garden has if it doesn't have a garden.\nIf the garden had grass, it would look like a grassland instead of a garden. Grasses are common green plants that can appear in gardens. \nHowever, the question does not describe a \"garden\" full of grass, but one without a garden instead. This suggests the answer must be something else. \nThe question specifically states that every time the person thought they planted a garden, it would not come to fruition. This implies that whatever the person planned to grow either didn't thrive or never materialized, which indicates that the answer choice must not be something positive, such as a flower or a bush. \nTherefore, the answer must indicate something that prevents or inhibits growth, like a weed, which grows naturally. This would prevent or inhibit the growth of a planted garden, implying that the person had no green thumb. \nTherefore the answer is: A: weeds.\n\nAnswer: A: weeds\n\nInput: He would leave home, what did he want?

This is a compelling reason to leave home, but this could also be achieved through many other means, such as traveling, starting a new career, or pursuing education opportunities.\nB: to get a new house.

Choices:  A; green B; brown C; blue D; red E; white\nRationales: This question can be broken down into two sections: understanding the intention behind the choices and identifying what characteristic of the choices makes them appropriate answers.\nStep 1: To understand the intention behind the choices, let's look at the options one by one:\nGreen : Associated with envy, not plant life.\nBrown: Not associated with color, not plant life. Blue : Associated with mood, not plant life. Red : Associated with energy, not plant life. White : Not associated with color, but also seems unlikely due to its negative connotation.\nStep 2: Since green is not a color commonly associated with plants, we can eliminate it. White is a color, but doesn't have any other relevant characteristics, so we can also eliminate it.\nStep 3: Let's consider the options that remain: brown, blue, and red.\nSince brown is a natural color for plants, and blue is a color that is often associated with relaxation or calmness, these two colors are possibly appropriate descriptions of a person's ability to grow plants.\nRed, on the other hand, is commonly associated with energy and vitality, so it may not be an appropriate characterization of a person's inability to grow plants.\nStep 4: Considering all of the above, the best answer is B: blue, which does not apply directly as a descriptor of a person's inherent abilities to grow plants, but is instead a color commonly associated with calmness and relaxation.\nAnswer: B : Blue, this is the most appropriate answer because it does not describe a person's plant growing abilities directly but is instead a color that is commonly associated with relaxation and calmness\n\nInput: What does it mean that we all know what is around us  that is how we are?

The question asks us what she was doing that was having an obviously negative effect on the plant.\nStep 1: First, eliminate words that refer to a positive outcome.\nStep 2: The statements that include the word \"doing\" are most likely the answer since they suggest an action taken.

Choices:  L: She had a poor diet B: She overwatered the plants C: They had the wrong soil D: She didn't have enough light E: She didn't fertilize them\nRationales: It's important to understand the context of the phrase \"had a poor diet\". To have a poor diet means to have a diet that is unhealthy and lacks essential nutrients that are needed to support healthy growth.\nWhen considering each option, we evaluate them based on whether they make sense given the fact that the plants keep dying, indicating a poor diet.\nL: This option suggests that she doesn't have a green hand because she overwatered the plants. This can't be related to the previous phrase \"had a poor\".\nB: This option could be relevant if she was overwatering the plants causing it to die, however, it's also possible that the plants are dying because of other factors that aren't related to overwatering.\nC: This may be relevant if she used improper soil leading to plant death, however it's also possible the plants were dying due to other unrelated reasons such as disease or insufficient nutrition.\nD: This option is related to the previous phrase but it's not relevant to the specific issue of the plants dying. Sunlight can be essential for plants to thrive but it's more likely to cause a plant to grow faster or yield more fruit rather than lead to its death.\nE: This option is specifically related to the previous phrase indicating lack of nutrients and not the death itself.

Look at the choice options, eliminating those that are clearly not applicable. Green, B: Red, and Yellow are not associated with sowing seeds and could therefore be discarded.\n2.

A brown thumb\n\nBrown thumbs don't always mean poor gardening skills; they could also mean low fertility of the soil or a specific type soil.\n\n#### Choice A. A brown thumb: Bad match\n\n> This isn't bad but it doesn't fit the context.\n\n\n#### Choice B. Black thumb\n\nThe phrase \"got a black thumb\" is widely associated with the inability or lack of skill to grow a plant or take care of it. This option is a probable answer as long as the phrase is used. However, here the phrase is not used directly and is only inferred.\n\n#### Choices B.

Choices: \u2b24 A: 2 B: 4 \u2b24 C: Sunday D: Wednesday E: Saturday\nRationales:  1. What we need to know is that the calendar has only seven days in it, so if the date is written as 20-4, 24, 25, or 204, it means it's already a leap year.  \n2. Then, the other things to look out for here are that the month and the day do not exceed the total number of days in the particular month. If we use the example where the date is February 2, then the month would only have 28 days, so when we add 4, we would have a date that exceed the total number of calendar days. This is considered as an invalid format.  \n3. Also, it's not necessary to write the day as day-month,", "answer": " 56"}
{"text": "could grow she would kill her plants. Choices:  A. Grow green ones B. Fail C. Kill D. Plants E. Make green\nRationales: First, comprehend the question. The term green thumb is generally used to describe a person who can garden well, specifically someone who has success with gardens, has good soil, and whose gardens are vibrant and prosperous.\n1. The sentence indicates the person had the intention to make their green thumb grow, but failed for some reason. \n2. \"Making Green\" is not a green thumb as it doesn't directly imply that the gardens will be thriving and vibrant.\n3. Choice A: \"Grow green\" is not correct as it makes it sound like the intent would be to develop a green thumb.\n4. It's possible that the person could fail but still have a green thumb, suggesting \"Fail C. Kill\" is not applicable as it suggests they would \"not grow green\".\n5. \"Plants E. Make green\" is a plausible option because plants not doing well would suggest a failed green thumb.\n6. Therefore, E: \"Make green\" is the correct answer. \nAnswer: E: Make green\n\nInput: I can't wait on ice cream while watching what, someone is playing? Choices: 1. A. A show on TV B. A sport C. An ice cream truck E. None of the above\nRationales: The question asks what the person would watch while waiting for ice cream and is unlikely to be watching an ice cream truck.\n1. A: \"A show on TV\" would not be relevant if one is waiting outside for an ice cream trunk, unless the show is also related to ice cream itself.\n2. A sport could fit because watching sports is a common pastime and could be relevant with ice cream, but the person would not be watching ice cream, just the sport.\n3. \"An ice cream truck\" would be the only logical answer as this would be the truck that was the target of our person's waiting.\n4. \"None of the above\" has an unclear meaning because it's missing some context or logical relation to the previous sentences or questions. Moreover, this term does not directly relate to the answer. \n5. Therefore,", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "wanted something, it would turn up withered and brown! Choices:  A. Fresh B. Plant C. Wish D. Desire E. Need\nRationales: There are two steps: 1. Understand the Question. The sentence here means that she had a poor relationship with plants. \n2. Identify the Correct Answer. The question is about her inability to grow green plants; we are searching for an option that refers to this situation. So, we consider the answers: fresh, plant, wish, desire, and need.\n3. Answer Choices Fresh and plant are not related to green plants. Wish and desire are not common phrases, but they could mean to wish for something or to desire it, which means the first step of their growth cycle - when they are still not a plant, but they're in a stage between non-plant and plant.\n4. Answer choice A, B, D and E refer to the plant's state, instead of the plant's initial intentions. A) refer to the plant' dying, B) refer to the plant, and E) refer to the color of the plant. These answer choices are not relating to the scenario where she tries to grow a green plant and fails every time.\n5. Therefore, answer choice C best fits the question as it refers to her thinking, and not to the plant.\nAnswer: C.

{"text": "planted something it would die. Choices:  A. dead B. yellow C. blue D. not enough water E. not enough sunlight\nRationales: The first step is to figure out what she's doing and what she's trying to achieve.\n1. We can eliminate \"not having a green thumb\". \n2. This is because this choice implies she has intentionally planted something and failed (indicating someone who, in many cases, can be classified with this label of ignorance).\n3. She is not purposely trying to plant something while failing; otherwise, it'd be obvious she didn't have a \"green thumb\". \n4. So the only relevant options are \"planting something she'd want to die\", which is pretty unrelated, or \"She was trying\", which is too vague considering she's a person. \n5. The person is trying to succeed. We can eliminate \"planting something she wanted to die\" and \"She was trying\". \n6. The person is trying and intending to succeed by planting something. This means she's trying to grow something, which is where all the options make sense. \n7. She intended to plant \"something\" and grow it, or at least care for it.\n8.

Choices: 1) A: a full grown plant (fragile flower, green leafs) 2) B: a dead plant 3) C: a yellow plant 4) D: grass from her back yard she put in a pot 5) E: a brown plant\nRationales: First, we understand the question we're posed and the possibilities.\n\n1. It's asking what would happen when she tries to grow indoor plants.  \n\nFrom the question, we have an understanding of what the intention is to grow an indoor plant.\n\nThe only options which really make sense are options 1 and 2, as that is what you would expect to happen if she does grow the garden indoors.\n\nShe has the \"green thumb\", the ability to grow plants as stated in the first sentence.\n\nSo we can conclude that she had a green thumb and would grow very good plants no matter what indoors.\nOption1 makes the most sense as it does not require too much logical thinking for the reader to understand that this is what would happen\n\n2. It was a full-grown plant, so the indoor plants must be of high quality.\n3. The green thumb she possessed would lead her to give up on growing indoor plants, as she struggled to nurture a plant.\n\n4. The option has a sense of humor in stating that because she grew grass from her backyard, she should move on to grow something bigger, stronger, or maybe more difficult for her to raise.\n\n5. She had a green thumb according to the first line of the sentence, and she did grow a plant successfully; however, the plant was brown.

Choices:  B: watering C: planting D: weeding E: pulling the plants from the ground\nRationales: The question asks us to determine what the woman was doing wrong. \n1. Consider each option: \n2. C: Planting - this doesn't make sense, as the woman was only told that she had no green thumb and was weeding the flowers. She wasn't planting flowers.\n 3. D: watering - the answer is \"watering,\" but \"watering\" is watering the flowers, and it makes sense.\n 4. B: weeding - this is \"pulling out\" the flower, \"pulling out\" is a way to describe \"watering,\" as it's a way to prevent plants from dying.\n5. A: planting - this doesn'\n6. E: pulling the plants out of the ground - this doesn't work as an answer, because then she would have no \"green thumb\". A green thumb is an indication of one's ability to keep plants alive.\n7.

Choices:  C: the sky was cloudy D: he knew E: he saw a tree fall F: he heard a loud thunder\nRationales:\n1. The question asks how man could know it was going to be raining if it was already raining.\n2. The best strategy is to consider all options one by one.\n1. C: The sky is cloudy - this is an indication of an incoming storm, and can imply the probability of rain. So, this is a plausible hint.\n2. D: He knew - another possible answer is that the man is familiar with the weather in his area. He could have witnessed the rain in the past, and knew it was going to rain.\n3. E: He saw a tree fall - This answer is not relevant because there is already rain, and he is considering the rain he foresees, not the rain he sees.\n4.

She thought she plant nothing. This doesn't make sense, as planting implies that something (a plant) will be planted.\nB. She thought she plant anything. This isn't a typical usage of the phrase \"plant anything,\" so it's not the correct answer. \nC. She thought about plant anything. This isn\u2019t the meaning of the phrase \u201cplant anything,\u201d so it can be excluded. \nD. She thinks about plant something. This isn't the meaning of the word \"planting.\" It describes the person's process of thinking about planting, not actually planting something, so it's not an accurate choice. \nE. She thought I was planning her. This doesn't relate to the person's ability to grow plants, it's just an example of a grammatically incorrect sentence that doesn't make sense. \nF.

{"text": "had, she killed the plant. Choices:  A. Flower B. Grass C. Bush D. Tree E. Fern\nRationales: The sentence in this question is asking us to determine the person's situation regarding plants. It's clear that she had a plant at least once that she thought she could \"keep\" or \"give a green thumb.\" However, her experience with keeping the plant resulted in the unfortunate death of this plant. \nWe can start by eliminating options that do not fit the narrative.\nOption C, bush, is not a plant. Choice A: flower is not the correct answer either since it would mean that the person is thinking about plants that do not have roots.\nChoice E: Fern is not the right option as ferns do not have roots and are native to forests and shady areas, not necessarily green thumbs.\nThese exclude the options of flower and fern from the list, leaving us with options B and D only.  \nOption B: Grass is a plant that may need a green thumb to nurture and take care of. \nOption D: Tree is a plant that, depending on its species, may or may not require a green thumb to survive. \nThis means our final options to choose from are D and B. \nGrass, as mentioned, needs water, nutrients, and a green thumb, so D: Tree is the correct answer. \nChoice D: Tree is the most accurate selection as it needs care and nurturing, a green thumb, to thrive and grow.  \nAnswer: D: Tree\n\nInput: On the road, where can the person pick up a drink before the shop closes?

{"text": "had made a progress what happens next? Choices: \nA: plant death\nB: plant success\nC: plant growing\nD: plant wilting\nE: plant thriving\nRationales:\n1. The sentence makes reference to a person who is not successful at gardening or growing plants. They might try various methods, including using fertilizer and pesticides, but they often fail in their efforts.\n2. This suggests that they're likely attempting to find methods that work rather than failing repeatedly by not using the right techniques.\n3. The question asks what happens when the gardener decides to use some kind of chemical or treatment to improve their plant's health.\n4. Each of the following choice choices can be eliminated because they would not qualify as a \"progress\" or new approach related to plant care.\n5. A: Plant death. This is not a typical response to using chemicals or a natural approach, but rather the outcome of inadequate watering, poor soil, or natural diseases.\n6. B: Plant success. Again, this outcome is not common after applying chemicals to a plant, and it doesn't fit the sentence logic.\n7. C: Plant growth. Growth is the normal response to an adequate watering or fertilizer regimen. This is not indicative of a progressive or new approach to improving the plant's health. \n8. D: Plant wilting. This is not typical for a plant that has been treated with chemicals or other methods, and it does not represent progress.\n9. E: Plant thriving. This is typical after applying proper care techniques, such as watering or fertilizing, and it isn't a progressive approach to improving the health of the plant. \n10.

{"text": "could grow something, it didn't make it. Choices:  A green thumb refers to B: talent C: patience D: luck E: skills\nRationales: First, remember that the word \"thumb\" does not refer to a physical thumb. We are looking for an inanimate object. Therefore, we can eliminate any answer that refers to a person, such as B: Patience and E: Skills. \n6. Now, move on to the remaining options: A: Talent, C: Luck, and D: Skills. It is clear that C: Luck is an unlikely choice; luck has no direct correlation to growing something planted. \n7. A: Talent does not make sense; a person would likely need to have a degree of effort, knowledge, and skills to grow something successfully. It's a combination of many factors which could potentially be referred to as \"talent,\" not just one. \n8. D: Skills is more relevant since skills include effort, and there are skills involved when growing something and taking care of it. However, \"she didn't have a\" does not seem to refer to a lack of effort, but specifically to a lack of success. This suggests that she was trying to grow something, failing to do so, and the phrase \"thought she could\" implies intention.\n9.

{"text": "was going to be outside she was inside. Choices:  A. greenhouse B. outside C. garden D. indoors E. in front of a computer\nRationales: There are several aspects to consider when solving this question, such as the context, vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure. \nFirst, consider the context of the sentence. The woman is said to have failed at gardening, or not developed the necessary skill or ability to garden successfully. This suggests that the answer choice should be about a person who enjoys gardening. \nNext, consider the vocabulary and linguistic features of the sentence. The phrase \"thought she\" gives more context on the intentions of the woman. This suggests that the woman was hoping to be outside, and wanted to use her \"green thumb\" to grow plants and flowers.\nNow, consider the grammar and sentence structure. The phrase \"She sure didn't have\" is followed by the verb form \"a green thumb\". This suggests that the woman actually had a \"red thumb\", meaning she was unable to develop a good garden or have a \"green thumb.\"\nFinally, look at the structure of the sentence. The first phrase states that the woman didn't have a \"green thumb\", and the second part of the sentence states that every time she tried to be outside she failed. This suggests that the correct answer choice is a person who stays indoors. \nTo summarize, the correct answer choice is D: indoors. The woman is said not to have a green thumb, despite attempts to garden outside, and remains indoors.\nAnswer: D. indoors\n\nInput: In a 120 degree room, if someone has a temperature of 105 Fahrenheit, how hot should they feel?

{"text": "planted roses, it was something else! Choices:  A. Pumpkin B. Sweet potato C. Cherry tomatoes D. Carrot E. Cantaloupe\nRationales: First, it is important to understand the question carefully. The focus here is on the fact that the roses were not growing, and this could be due to many reasons.\nOne such reason could be inappropriate planting, which indicates poor selection of plants for the given environment. Hence, any plant that did not thrive is out of the picture.\nNow, we have to pick a fruit that will meet the environmental condition and that is suitable for planting.\n\nStep 1 to find suitable planting: We have to identify the environment first, and then choose a fruit that will suit the environment.\nWe can start by ruling out the obvious exceptions\nOption A: The first environment where the fruit will thrive is a greenhouse. But nothing will grow inside a greenhouse that's not planted by humans.\nOption B: She was cultivating the land, but the fruit cannot be pumpkin, sweet potato, or tomato.\nOption C: She was cultivating a fruit garden and not flower garden, and the rose, tomato, and pumpkin were not growing, so we have to exclude fruit as a planting option. \nStep 2 to determine the fruit to plant:\nFrom a selection of fruits, we can easily pick the one that matches the soil condition and season, so in this case, her roses did not thrive, and therefore she could only try the best choice, which is an option D.\nAs there is no choice that fits all the conditions, the closest option among is a carrot.\nStep 3 to eliminate other options:\nShe did put in a lot of effort and was even planting in the ground, which could easily lead to confusion as we all know vegetable cultivation requires a lot of effort and time.\nBut it might have looked simpler to her as roses were not growing. \nAll the other options fail as they require more effort and time.\nThus, the best option to have is always a carrot.\n\nAnswer: D.

The given information: it is known that the person is feeding plants, and that the plants die or turn colors when this happens.\n3. The given options: A. green thumb B: brown thumb C: white thumb D: black thumb E: purple thumb \n\nThe correct answer is A. green thumb\n\nA green thumb is defined as a gifted ability to grow living things. This can refer to the ability to grow flowers, vegetables, or other plants. The answer choice is accurate to the given information because the person tries to nurture the plants by watering them and feeding them by adding fertilizer. However, it is not accurate to characterize the person as having a green thumb because this leads us to believe that plants are alive, grow, and flourish after this care is provided. When this care is given, it kills the plants or turns their leaves brown or black. This makes the choice inaccurate to the given information.\n\nChoices B, C, and D, the brown, white, and black thumbs, are inaccurate because brown and white thumbs refer to plant death of green or lime-colored growth.\nFinally, choice E, the purple thumb refers to a gifted ability to create beautiful plant arrangements, which is not the question the given options are trying to answer.

{"text": "was getting plants healthy they all died. Choices:  A. plants B. flowers C. leaves D. roots E. soil \nRationales: We go through the five options and look for one that's missing as an option for plant as we see it will not die but will live and grow well if it is taken care of.\n1. Plants are organisms that live in soil, so we can eliminate the possibility of Option C, Leaves, because this can happen when the plant dies.\n2. Option B, flowers, are not plants as we understand them, so we can eliminate it as a possible answer choice.\n3. Options C, D, and E all involve plant health, which are not missing in the text.\n4. The correct answer will have a missing word in the text, so we consider Option A. Plants as mentioned in the text are taken care of but die anyway or grow poorly when she tries to make them grow healthy. So, we look at the word used in the option A. This word is \"thought\", it is something that is only in our mind and has nothing to do with plants. So we can eliminate this answer choice.\n5. The correct answer, \"She sure didn't have green thumb\" meaning she doesn't know how to take care of a plant. So, she tries to take care of the plant, but it still dies because she is not following the right procedure. \nAnswer: A. she sure didn't have the green thumb\n\nInput: What did the author use to tell they were going to get tired? Choices: A. adverb B. adjective C. metaphor D. antonym E. pun\nRationales: First, let's break down this riddle.\n1. They = she\n2. The author = writer\n3. They were going to get tired = the writer is going to be getting tired\n4. This does not mean that there weren't already tired, it means that they would be\n5. Therefore we go through the different types of words to see which one is describing tiredness.\n6. Our first instinct is to try to find: adverbs, adjectives, and metaphors, but none of these words is sufficient and only two words (metaphor and pun) fit.\n7. Now we need to identify the specific meaning of these", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": "had it, she saw what? Choices: 1. A: flies 2. B: ants 3. C: frogs 4. D: flowers 5. E: dead mice\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about a person who thought they had a green thumb, but actually didn't.\n2. We first start by considering what a green thumb is. A green thumb generally refers to a person who has successful gardening skills. \n3. The next step is considering the possible answer choices, where each option relates to the situation of missing a \"green thumb\".\n4. A \"frog\" is an animal that some people believe is associated with good luck, so we eliminate this option.\n5. A phrase like \"saw a dead mouse\" would be more likely to relate to someone who had unsuccessful gardening skills, not a \"green thumb\". We can then eliminate option B: ants and option C: dead mice.\n6. Ants can be found outside during the summer, but this is not a connection directly with a green thumb. Therefore, option B is another option that needs to be discarded.\n7. Flowers are not a symbol of having a green thumb in any way. This further suggests this is not the correct answer choice.\n8. We can determine that the correct answer is A: flies, as their presence typically indicates a lack of cleanliness and care, which is a characteristic of someone who may not have a green thumb.\nAnswer: A. Flies\n\nInput: A: to B: over C: for D: next E: away\nRationales: First, determine the context of the conversation. The person seems to be discussing a task that needs to be done.\nSecond, consider the choice options and the potential outcomes of each choice.\n3. \"To\" typically refers to the direction of movement or a starting point. For example, the phrase \"We're going to the park\" means that the speaker wants to go to the park. In this scenario, the person is more likely talking about which destination, and not the direction of travel.\n4. \"Over\" refers to the completion of a task. For example, the sentence \"I finally finished the project over the weekend\" means that the speaker has completed the project. In this case, the person is more interested in the progress of the project", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": "could plant flowers she would kill them. Choices:  A. kill them B. do not work C. not right D. no luck E. never\nRationales: Each answer option contains a different set of words, so we'll need to determine if any of the words match with the phrase stated. Let's break and decode this phrase: \"She sure didn't have...\" It seems likely that the rest of the phrase would be... \"have a green thumb.\" \nNow, let's check the answer options: 1. \"She sure didn' t have a green thumb\" This is correct.\n2. \"kill them\" Does not match.\n3. \"do not work\" Doesn't match.\n4. \"not right\" Doesn't fit in this sentence.\n5. \"no luck\" Doesn't make sense here.\n6. Therefore, only the first option (\"kill them\") matches with the phrase, so our answer is A. kill them\nAnswer: A. kill them\n\nInput: The man was running on the treadmill at a fast speed. Do the man feel tired to be the reason for running to the treadmill? Choices:  Yes  No\nRationales: The second step is to consider all the answer choices and compare them against the given text. If any answer choice doesn't make sense, based on the information given, we can eliminate it. We are looking for a response that makes sense and can be interpreted logically from the given information.\nWhen looking at the answer choices, we can see that the choice \"No\" seems like the most logical answer. It makes sense that if a person is running on a treadmill at a high speed, they may feel tired afterward. This is because the high-intensity exercise of running on the tread-\nMill may cause a person to become tired. On the other hand, the choice \"Yes\" doesn't seem to make much sense.

{"text": "was watering the yard she was watering what? Choices: 4: her family 5: the neighbors lawns 6: her garden with the wrong amount of water 3: the garden\nRationales: The key to answering this question is to interpret it correctly and understand that \"the neighbors lawns\" is not watered but \"the neighbors lakes.\"\n1. The first step in understanding the question is by interpreting the context. 2. Reading the sentence several times clarifies that when the person thinks they are watering her garden, they are instead watering their neighbors' yard. 3. This does not sound like something a person would think about for very long, meaning the situation would most likely be an accidental misconception, making a lack of understanding a more probable explanation than a conscious deception.\n4. The gardener is referring to her own garden, not her neighbors' yards.\n5. They did not water the neighbors' lawns since they were watering their own.\n6. Based on the context, it's unclear what the other garden means since it doesn't make sense to \"water the wrong amount of water.\" The sentence does not seem grammatically correct in this interpretation.\n7. Based on the context and interpretation of the choice options, it's more likely that they were not watering the neighbors' lakes, but their own garden.\nAnswer: 3: the garden", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "was going to plant the flowers, she didn't know what to do? Choices:  a: buy potting soil b: fertilize c: pull them out d: plant them e: water them\nRationales: It's important to first read the sentence slowly and carefully. Here we see that someone has difficulty gardening, and they've tried but kept getting things wrong. \n1. When interpreting the possible answers, it helps to consider what the person has said they did in hopes of planting the flowers successfully: \"they didn't know what [to do].\" \n2. The word \"not\" implies that a person was thinking or intends to try again. 3. \"Pull them out\" is obviously not the correct action to take, as this refers to removing existing flowers or plants rather than trying something new. \n4. The answers can be interpreted as positive or negative actions, and it is unlikely that \"pulling them out\" is a successful action in this case. \n5. Next, \"water them\" does not seem to be a positive answer, as it is usually something done to existing flowers or plants. It is also not mentioned in the context of trying to plant something. \n6. Finally, fertilize (option B), buy potting soil (option A), and plant them (option D) seem like possible positive actions to take to improve gardening, but they are not mentioned in the context or meaning of the original sentence. We do not know what the person intended to do, but we do know they already tried planting the flowers. \n7. Therefore, \"plant the flowers\" (option D), is the correct answer. When we attempt to do something, we usually also think about what to do. There are two things to consider: what we intend to do and what we actually do. \n8. In this case, the person was thinking about planting the flowers, so the intended action is \"plant them\". We must look to the other side of the statement for what actions were actually taken. Here, we can see that they tried planting the flowers but were unsuccessful. \n9. This would suggest that they didn't know what actions to take initially, meaning they had a lack of knowledge (green thumb) about gardening. They were trying to plant the flowers (intention), which was an attempt to improve their skills (action).", "answer": " 4"}

Choices:  A. give up on the plant B. forget the plant C. start caring for the plant better D. never water the plant again E. the plant died\nRationales:1. The first step in solving this question is to understand what the person was trying to indicate by saying: \u201cshe sure didn\u2019t have a green thumb.\" In other words, in what way could it be established that this person has a poor track record with plants?\n2. We could then explore the answer choices and eliminate any answer that does not fit with the general context.\n3. Answer A) gives up on the plant is irrelevant in this scenario, as the person failed to do so. Option B) forgot the plant, although might fit the context, is not the only possible answer. Answer C) could give the impression that the person is simply trying harder to have a positive experience with the plant by caring for it better, which conflicts with the context of the text. \n4. Answer 5) never water the plant again, while technically possible, does not fit the theme of the sentence.\n5. Answer 6) plant died, is more likely based on the context of the question, as the person seems to be struggling to remember to water their plant. The person fails to continue the process, meaning that eventually, the plant does face a likely demise as a consequence. \nHence, the correct answer is E). A person could feel like they have a poor track record with taking care of plants, but they keep trying because they don't want to stop and believe their efforts will come to fruition in the end.\nAnswer: E). she sure didn\u2019t have the green thumb, every time I thought I would give the plant some, I forgot about it.\n7.

{"text": "killed the plants they grew back. Choices:  A. The plants weren't real  B. They really like her  C. The plants were poisoned D. She needed fertilizer E. They weren't real\nRationales:\n1. The first step in understanding what the question is asking is to take time to interpret the statement and establish what the writer meant by it. Here, the writer clearly means to convey that the woman in question was incapable of growing plants. \n2. The second step, then, is to analyze the given answer choices and discern what they mean, and how they relate to the statement. \n3. Choice A. The plants werent real. This choice does not explain the plants continuously growing back when the woman thought she killed them. The plants didn't really grow back even if she thought she killed them, they still werent real. \n4. Choice B. They really like Her. This choice does not make sense because the plants cannot have a feeling or a preference. They are not alive. The plants cannot have a preference for anyone in particular. \n5. Choice C. The plants were Poisoned. This choice does not seem plausible because the woman seems to have tried many times to kill the plants without any success, which suggests that the plants were not poisoned. In fact, it is the direct opposite of the statement -the woman who is trying to kill the plants never succeeds. \n6. Choice E. They weren\u2019t real. The previous 3 choices were eliminated and that is why this remains the possible explanation. What this means is that the woman was killing fake plants or not growing real ones.

She sure didn't seem to have any success with her plant-growing attempts.\n2. The following steps consist of evaluating the answer choices and choosing the best option to fit the question.\n3. One could say the answer is flowers given that they were grown successfully to produce a yellow flower, but this sentence doesn't include green, flowers, so we know this is incorrect.\n4. \"green\" and \"think\" are repeated keywords, so it is apparent that the answer should have to do with growing green things.\n5. The grasses option isn't likely given that grasses are usually associated with something outside, something she surely didn't have given the sentence.\n6. She's clearly not growing fruits, and we know from the previous steps that her plant-growers weren't green, so vegetables is unlikely. \n7. Only flowers have green, but \"thought she grew\" suggests that she didn't succeed in growing flowers, so flowers are not a correct answer.\n8. The only option we're left with is \"none of the above\", making it the correct answer.\n9. The sentence says \"every time\", giving the impression that she has been trying multiple times.\n10.

I see that the clue words are burned record and green thumb. The first task talked about burning a record, while this task talks about green thumb. A green thumb is when someone does a good job growing plants and other green things.\n\nA green thumb requires a lot of water, sunlight, and other things that are used to make things grow.

{"text": "had a tree there was a what? Choices: \n1. A: drip 2.B: shrub 3. C: flower 4. D: flowerpot 5. E: grass\nRationales: The question refers to a situation in which someone does not have a particular ability or talent. The options that could be associated with this are \"1: drip, 2: shrub, 3: flower, 4: flowerpot, 5: grass.\"\nWe begin by eliminating options that do not fit the context. \"4: flowerpot\" is a container, and not a feature or characteristic. Flower pots do not have a green thumb, and the character in the question did not have a green thumb. Similarly, \"5: grass\" is not a plant that is often grown in gardens or pots and therefore is not relevant to the context.\nLooking at the remaining options, options 1: drip and 2: shrub are physical elements, and not features associated with a green thumb.\nOptions 3: flower and 4: flowerpot do have the potential to be relevant. However, while one can grow different types of flowers in their garden, or in a flowerpot in their yard, flowers do not need a green thumb to grow, and are not therefore typically associated with someone without this ability.\nTherefore, options 3: flower and option 4: flowerpot cannot be used as potential answer choices, leaving us with option 5: grass as the only remaining answer.\nAnswer: 5: grass\n\nInput: What does the doctor do during a colonoscopy? Choices: 1.A: make a small incision 2. B: insert catheter 3. C: remove lump 4. D: inject contrast agent 5. E: empty the organ\nRationales: We begin by understanding the question and the intended answer. The patient will most likely be sedated or asleep during the entire procedure, so the doctor will perform the procedure and not necessarily make the patient aware of each step.\nLooking at each of the 5 options, we can eliminate options 3: remove lump because this is not associated with a colonoscopy.\nSimilarly, options 1: make a small incisino, option 2: insert catheter, 4: inject contrast agent, and 5:", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "had a nice garden? Choices:  B: a bug infestation C: the neighbor's dog D: mice infesting E: all of them\nRationales:  1. The sentence asks about a person who \"sure didn\u2019t have a green thumb.\"\n2. A green thumb is commonly used to describe someone who has success planting and nurturing plants and herbs.\n3. Therefore, the options A, B, C, D, and E must describe situations or events that occur during plant growth.\n4. Option A: Bug Infestation. Plant growth is usually associated with insects, but not usually in such a significant way to indicate failure.\n5. Option B: Neighbor\u2019s Dog. This may be true, but it doesn't necessarily indicate failure or poor quality.\n6. Option C: Mice Infestation. Mice can infest a garden, but this is usually more common outside or underneath the house.\n7. Option D: All of them. We should narrow down our choices first, so we can eliminate unneeded options.\n8. Only choice E can represent the \"bug infestation\" problem.\n\"She sure didn't have many green thumbs\" could be read as her not having enough green thumbs or the opposite, her having many green thumbs, but no green thumbed.\n9. Therefore the answer is B: The neighbor's dog\nAnswer: B: The neighbor'sdog\n\nInput: Where would one take the family if they're traveling? Choices:  D: Grand Canyon E: Alaska F: Hollywood G: Yosemite\nRationales:1. The sentence implies that we're traveling with a family, and we're going to a place outside of the country.\n2. Next step is to consider each location in the options and ask yourself if it can fit the phrase \"one of the family takes it.\"\n3. Starting with option A: Grand Canyon. This is a natural landmark and one of the most famous tourist destinations, but that doesn't mean every single family member has to see the Grand Canyon.\n4. Moving on to B: Alaska. If the family is traveling internationally, Alaska is one of the first places to suggest. However, this location is much", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "'d succeed, everything dried up! Choices:  A. was a gardener B. she used weed killer C. she overwatered the garden D. the plants wilted  E. the plants died\nRationales: We can understand the meaning of \"everything dried up\" as representing the plants dying, which supports answers D and E and suggests that they are the most plausible options.\n\nAnswer: D. the plants wiled; E. the plants died.", "answer": " 3450"}
{"text": "made a plant healthier it died. Choices:  A : plant B C : grow D : cut E: plant again\nRationales: A: plant - As we are looking for what someone did not find out. Plant doesn't mean what she did not know.\nB: growing - This is the wrong option as we are looking for what she could not do not grow.\nD: cut - Cut isn't the right option as what she could not do what we are looking for\nE: plant again - Plant again isn't the correct answer as what she did not do.\nAnswer: E : plant again", "answer": " 76"}
{"text": "was successful she would fail, in which type of sport would this apply to? Choices:  C: soccer D: softball E: track and field F: baseball\nRationales: Initial analysis: The sentence implies the person in question does not have a green thumb, indicating they lack skills in gardening. We assume all the answer choices are related to sports. \n1. Soccer (choice C) is normally a team sport, so the question's phrasing seems odd. \n2. Similar to soccer, softball(choice D) is also not a singular sport. Softball could be a team sport in some cases, but it's usually played as an individual or a pair.\n3. In track and field, athletes perform activities like running, jumping and throwing. \n4. Baseball(choice F) is one of the most classic American sports, but it also involves multiple players performing various activities.\n5. As with our first analysis, the question's phrasings seem off, and these answers lack the intended meaning\n6. Based on the intended meaning, you should ask yourself which of the available options has the least activities involved, making it suitable for one person.\n7. Track and field (Choice E), would probably be the answer choice as it is an individual sport with an extensive catalog of events such as running, jumping and hurdles.\n8. Therefore option E: track and field is the correct answer. \nAnswer: E: track and field\n\nInput: In the carnival, if you saw a performers you pay them what? Choices:   A: ride ticket B: balloon C: prize D: ride E: ticket \nRationales: First, understand the question: The key takeaway is to understand that the person is looking to pay a performer. Each choice needs to be considered carefully and be relevant to the topic. \n1. Ride ticket (Choice A): A ride ticket is paid to access a carnival ride. While it can be purchased, it is not used to pay a carnival performer. \n2. Balloon (Choice B): A balloon is a novelty item given away or handed out as a prize. While it might be given to a carnival performers, it is not generally paid. \n3. Prize (Choice C): A prize is a reward given in exchange", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": "was growing carrots for her garden it was really growing what? Choices: \tA: tomatoes B: turnips C: cucumbers D: cabbages E: grapes\nRationales: The first step is to consider all the available choices and eliminate options that are not applicable.\nThe second step is to consider each choice in more detail to understand why it is either correct or incorrect.\nThe following is a list of each choice, its reasons for being correct, and arguments for why it is incorrect.\nA. Tomatoes. Tomatoes are the correct answer because they are a type of vegetable that she tried growing in her garden. Tomatoes are a green vegetable that can be used to cook or eat raw.\nB. Turnips. Turnips are not a green vegetable that could be used to grow in a garden or in a farm. Therefore, turnips do not grow in gardens.\nC. Cucumbers. Cucumbers are a type of vegetables that are commonly grown in gardens. However, they are not a green vegetables \nD. Cabbages. Cabbages are not a type of vegetable commonly grown in gardens or farms. Therefore, cabbages do not grow in gard\nE. Grapes. Grapes are a fruit that is used to make wine. They are not a type of greens.\nThis implies that she had a green thumb because she was successful in growing vegetables. However she was not growing carrots.\nThis is because she confused carrots with kohlrabi, which are purple with a tough outer skin. \nAnswer: A: Tomatoes\n\nInput: The doctor and the nurse are what for the person? Choices:  C: family members D: colleagues E: friends\nRationales: We can rule out choice A: relatives. Relatives typically refer to members of one's bloodline, such as parents, siblings, or extended family, and would generally not be referring to a healthcare provider.\nNow, let's look at our remaining options.\nChoice B: Friends. While Friends and colleagues can have a friendly relationship, it doesn't make sense that a nurse and doctor is referring to a friend. Because this is a test or interview, we will assume they are not talking about friends.\nChoice E: Friend. This is a pla", "answer": " 2000"}
{"text": "was planting what? Choices:  -\tA: herb  -\tB: grass  -\tC: tree  -\tD: tomato plant  -\tE: flowers\nRationales: First, understand, the question and analyze each option. Here are the possible answer choices:\n\nHerb:  It refers to a class of plants or leaves used for adding flavor to food, like basil, parsley, etc.\nGrass:  It refers to short, green vegetation widely found in fields or lawns, used for decoration or eating.\nTree:  It refers to tall plants that bear fruit or are grown commercially for timber or ornamental purposes.\nTomato plant:  It refers to the tomato plant, which produces the tomato fruit.\nFlowers:  They refer to beautiful, colorful, or sweet-smelling plants used for decoration, often in bouquets.\nThe answer choice with a green thumb means having a knack for planting and growing things. The phrase here, \"She sure didn't have one,\" implies that she didn't succeed in planting and growing anything.\nBy analyzing each answer choice, we can conclude that the answer choice with a green touch is not A: \"Herb\", B: \"Grass\", C: \"Tree\", D: \"Tomato plant\", or E: \"Flowers\".\nThis means the answer is D: \"Tomato plants\".\nAnswer: D: tomato plants\n\nInput: What do you think it would take for a bite of apples to go?

First, consider all the possible response options to determine which one answers the question best:\n\nA: \u00bd apple. This is not correct as it doesn't answer the question correctly.\n\nB: one apple. This is also incorrect as it doesn't specify the necessary amount to successfully finish the whole apple, which is what we are being asked about.\n\nC: 4 appels. This is also incorrect, as 4 apples cannot", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "'d have fresh flowers. She tended to have what? Choices: \tA: brown  bread B: green leaves C: dead plants D: brown plants E: dead flowers\nRationales:\n1. The question presents us with a story that explains the meaning of the phrase \"She sure didn't have green thumb.\" \n2. If an object or living thing doesn't have a greenish color, it could be called \"brown.\"\n3. Using this knowledge, we can eliminate choice B: green leaves. This phrase refers to a greenish color, which implies the leaves are green.\n4. Similarly, choice B: brown plants and choice E: dead flowers, is also eliminated because they reference a specific, distinct color. \n5. This leaves us with choice D: brown bread and choice A: brown bread. Choice D: brown bread refers to a non-green \"plant\" that is brown in color.\n6. Choice A: brown bread is different because it can refer to multiple different objects. It is unclear if the phrase \"She tended to have brown bread\" means she had one or many of such objects. So, we can eliminate it and consider whether choice D: brown bread is the correct answer. \n7. As we know, choice D: brown bread refers only to a single object, implying that she had one brown loaf of bread, so we can choose the option D: brown bread.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: How was their first date? Choices: 1. they asked to move things to her house 2.  their date seemed okay but then they didn't want to go out again 3. he said something about her 4. he was very formal 5. they had things in common\nRationales: First, we should understand what this might mean.\n\nNext, we have some considerations:\n\n1. The phrase \"seemed okay, but then they didn' it\" may be referring to something negative that later occurred, or it could be referring to one of the choices.\n2. The phrase \"had things in common\" implies a good experience - which is the opposite of \"had things in common\".\n\nThis leaves us with 4 possibilities:\n\n1. Choice 2 seems like a bad experience based on the preceding choices.\n2. Choice 3 can't also be true if", "answer": " 3900"}
{"text": "would, what happened? Choices: A: plants died B: failed C: grew over D: sprouted E: grew more\nRationales:\n1. A green thumb is associated with the success of plants, not their failure. So A is incorrect.\n2. Failure does not involve success, so C is incorrect.\n3. Growing over refers to overgrowth, not successful growth. So B is incorrect.\n4. Sprout is synonymous with successful growth and development, so E is incorrect.\n5. Growing more implies that it's successful, not unsuccessful. So D is incorrect.\n6. Therefore, \"She sure didn't have \u2026\" means she didn't have success, so the best answer is D: grew more.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: Your friend took the phone, how can he call someone? Choices: A:\"by accident\" B: \"by chance\" C: \"he forgot\" D: \"by mistake\" E: \"out loud\"\nRationales: To understand the question, we must define what we mean by \"took the phone\" as the question does not provide more context. \"Took\" typically means to take something. This means your friend is holding or using the phone. A possible reason would be to call someone. \nThinking of the choices, we can now consider whether it's possible for a person to call someone on another person's phone without the permission of the owner.\n\nStep 1: First, we understand the meaning of \"by accident\" and \"by chance\". \"By accident\" means it is not intentional or planned. It's something that happens unexpectedly or without reason. \n\"By chance\" means it was not planned or expected, but one that presents itself as an opportunity. \n\nStep 2: Next, we understand the meaning and plausibility of \"he forgot\", which implies that it is likely that your friend did not mean to take the phone and would have returned it. This is unlikely if your friend is using the phone. So, this is not a probable answer.\n\nStep 3: Let's consider \"he forgot\". This means that your friend is not acting with intentionality or intent when he holds that phone. So, he's not able to call someone on that phone. This is relevant only if that phone is not in use", "answer": " 57"}
{"text": "planted it wouldn't grow. Choices:  A. garden soil B. seed C. water D. fertilizer E. weed\nRationales: When the sentence structure is rearranged in a way that makes the meaning more clear, it becomes obvious that the question asks which of the options is the likely cause of failure in \"her [the person's] green thumb.\" \nThe person is likely to be trying to grow a plant, and their inability to do so confirms the lack of a green thumb. \n1. Garden soil: This would be a suitable option if the person's intention were to grow plants using garden soil. But it specifically mentions that they were trying to plant something and it would not grow, so the soil is not likely to be the problem. \n2. Seed: This can be a cause of failure, if the person is attempting to plant a seed and it does not sprout or fail to grow afterward. \n3. Water: Without adequate water, the seed would not grow at all. So, this is likely to be an area where the person has failed, but not the only area. \n4. Fertilizer: While applying fertilizer can help growing plants, the person may not be applying it correctly or be using the wrong type of fertilizer. This can result in failure in plant growth. \n5. Weed: This is a possibility and can result in lack of growth, even if the gardener is very meticulous with regard to watering and applying fertilizer to the garden. The fertilizer can fail to help the plants to develop. \n6. Accordingly, the correct answer is C: water. While all the other options could cause a lack of growth in the plant, if the person is not watering enough, the plant will wither due to lack of water.\nAnswer: C. Water\n\nInput: Why do we need a password to log into a website? Choices:  a. to make our accounts more secure b. to not get hacked c. to be better at using the website d. to keep our information private and secure from others\nRationales: The goal is to determine which answer is the most likely reason for needing a password, not to determine which one is more true.\n1. a: It's not the most likely reason. To be more secure means that", "answer": " 1280"}
{"text": "was growing a garden, her vegetables always withered away. Could she not have done anything about it? Choices A: Yes, she did nothing B: Yes, she was not paying attention C: Certainly, with some water it would grow well D: Maybe, she needed more patience E: Never, she forgot to fertilize the soil\nRationales: Follow these steps in order to answer the question. 1. Read the statement. It includes an indication of ineffective actions followed by an apparent consequence.\n2. Examine the answer choices: a situation which is impossible to be true or doable should be excluded as an option.\n3. Answer choices B and C may be plausible, though the specific solution should not be in the range of such answers.\n4. Answer choices A, B and E can be entirely excluded since they do not include any suggestion on how she should have done things differently to ensure the planting and growth of green vegetables.\n5. Answer choice D is the correct answer as it provides an insight on how she should have handled things differently to nurture and ensure growth of plants in future, should she wish to do so again.\n6. Answer choice E should be excluded since it does not provide a solution to the problem.\n7. There are three possible combinations that describe the plausible consequence if she does nothing: vegetables dry up, she wastes effort, or she forgets to fertilize.\n8. The plausible consequence cannot be \"she is not paying attention\" given that the option involves action (planting / sowing seeds) which requires thought and attention.\n9. Answer choice D provides an insight on what she should do in the future while Answer choice B and Answer choice C are completely wrong / irrelevant.\n10. Answer choice E is ruled out as incorrect for the same reason explained above.\n11. Therefore, the correct option to choose from remains D.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "might have a plant thrive, it wouldn't last more than a day or two. Choices:  A. green thumbnail B. plant care C. vegetables D. bachelor's degree E. flower arrangement\nRationales: The question asks about choice B: plant care. The focus of the sentence is on how she could not take care of her plant. It's important not to distract ourselves with words like \"time\" in the sentence. Since the sentence mentions the time it took for her plant to last beyond two days, the plant care is likely the reason why her plant did not last for a long time. \nAnswer: B: Plant Care", "answer": " 17"}
{"text": "might have a good job, and she couldn't even keep her plants alive!\nRationales: The two sentences make sense, but they are worded awkwardly as they are not two coherent sentences.\n1. The first sentence in the second set implies she had a plant at one point but couldn't keep it alive, and therefore didn't have a \"green thumb\" (good gardening skills)\n2. The second sentence further implies that she wasn't good at gardening, and didn't have a job related to gardening, and therefore had a poor job.\n3. The sentences could be rephrased to a clearer meaning:\n4. She didn't have a good job. Every time she thought she might find a good job, she couldn't even manage to keep her plants alive! That is, she was never really good at gardening.\n5. Now, let's examine each of the answer choices, starting with A: Green thumb\n6. The idea of a job related to garden is not represented by this choice.\n7. B: good job is not a job related to garden, so it can be eliminated.\n8. C: bad job, is not related to garden.\n9. D: greenery, as an agricultural term, is unrelated to gardening skills, so it can be dropped as the answer choice.\n10. Lastly, considering the second sentence, and the fact that she couldn't keep her job, E: jobless is the appropriate answer to this situation, where the writer is giving an example of why the subject may have been unable to keep a good job.\nAnswer: E- she couldn't keep a job-jobless\n\nInput: Which could be a reason why one would keep coming back to the exact same place they were before? Choices:  a: they are trying to help someone b: they keep forgetting where they left their phone c: they like the place d-none of the above \n\nRationales: A person may keep returning to an identical place because they can\u2019t find their missing phone. Although there are plenty of places one may go to look for their lost phone, once one realizes where they left it, it wouldn't be hard to go back and retrieve it. \n\nSimilarly, if someone was having trouble looking for a particular place due to limited memory,", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "could grow some plants she kills them. What do you call it? Choices: 1. A: success  B: failure 2. C: green B: pink 3. D: failure E: success\nRationales: The question is asking for the word \"it\" in the phrase \"She sure didn't have ____\". This word might represent success or failure depending on the context of the question.\nOption 1: A: success - This can be used to refer to the act of growing plants or any other positive outcome achieved. In the given question, this might mean that she was able to grow plants successfully even though she said \"I can't\".\nOption 2: B: failure - Although this option might be true, it doesn't answer the question. The question is asking \"what do you call it?\" not \"what does it mean?\" The options are synonyms that represent the same event.\nOption 3: D: failure - This option might also be true, but it doesn't answer \"what do you call ____\" as the question is asking about. The term \"failed\" cannot be called \"___\".\nOption E: Success - Successful means achieving success, achieving the desired outcome or fulfilling one's goals. In the question, the girl wants to grow plants, but she thought she would fail so she said \"I can\u2019t\". Therefore, she achieved success and the term \"success\" can answer the question.\nAnswer: E : Success\n\n### Instructions:\nExplain how it was possible for someone to travel by boat to Italy from Greece in ancient times. \n\n### Demostration: \nThink about the following 2 sentences:\n1.

Choices:  A What she did with flowers: 2  B What she did with grass: 1  C What she did with tree: 1  D What she did with bushes: 1  E What she did with shrubs: 1\nRationales: The sentence indicates that every time she planted flowers, they were dying. This means that none of her plants grow, as they are all dead.\nOption 1: C  What she did with tree could either mean she cut down the tree, which would be counted as planting a tree, or she planted trees, in which case she did what she did with trees. Either way, her trees aren't alive, so it doesn't fit here.\nOption 2: B, What she did with grass could either mean she planted grass, in which case she failed, or she did not plant grass, in which case also she failed, so there are no other options, and we can confidently say she didn't have a \"green thumb.\"\nOption 3: A, What she did with flowers could either mean she planting flowers, again resulting in failure, or she did not do anything with flowers, in which case also failure.

{"text": "was having what? Choices:  Choices:  A) luck  B) hard time  C) break  D) opportunity  E) problem\nRationales: This question is an example of using a phrase where the literal translation is not the intended meaning. The phrase \"green thumb\" usually refers to someone who is adept at gardening or plant care.\n7. In this case, the phrase represents someone who is unskilled or unsuccessful in gardening.\n8. The sentence makes it clear that the character in question did not in fact have a green thumb.\n9. The first option is A, luck. \"Luck\" is not a common negative or positive trait associated with gardening, so it's probably not a suitable answer.\n10. Next, the list is: have a hard time, have a break, have an opportunity, and have a problem.\n11. Of these, we can exclude \"break\" because it's not the sort of event that is associated with gardening.\n12. Similarly, \"problem\" is not the same thing as \"opportunity\" but has the same negative connotation of a lack of success.\n13. Option E is the literal meaning of \"have a problem,\" but in this phrase, we're referring to gardening, so it would be misleading and not accurate.\n14. Option D is \"have an opportunity,\" which fits the context, but the phrase \"thought she was having\" in the sentence makes it a more natural choice to select the literal translation \"have a problem.\"\n15. The correct answer option is then D, \"have an opportunity.\"\nAnswer: D: have an opportunity\n\nInput: Someone needs to finish by 12 o'clock, but they forgot where to start, what were they planning to do by that time?

First, let's consider any possibility that the activity could be finished.\n9. Option A is \"get a drink.\" This is unlikely. There's no reason why someone would need to go get a drink at the time when they're supposed to be done with the activity.\n10", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "would plant flowers and she always chose which of the following? Choices: 1. Dirt 2. Garden 3. Potted Plants 4. Lawn 5.

If you do not, review the question and re-read it until you fully understand what you are being asked. \nMake sure you understand the options, and think about which option makes the most sense. Consider the options that may seem far-fetched or unlikely. These could be red herrings, or distractors, that are meant to confuse you. \nStart by eliminating options that seem the least likely. \nCheck for common sense. Consider whether the choices seem logical based on logic and common sense. If an answer seems outlandish or illogical, then it may not be the correct answer. \nConsider all the options. Don't simply eliminate all possible answers and miss the correct one. You may need to come back to the question and try to think of other options after you've reviewed all the choices. \nLook for relationships between the answer choices. You can often find clues in the relationship between the choices.\n\nInput: Which of the following does not describe where you would find igneous rock? Choices:   1. Lava 2. Hot springs 3. Basalt columns 4. Granite 5. Magma\nRationales: First, identify the specific type of rock that is being asked about and determine its defining characteristics. \nSecond, eliminate choices that do not make sense. \nLook for common words and relationships among the answer choices that might indicate which one does not fit.\nCertainly, the answer lies in the relationship among the choices; otherwise, one of them is bound to be correct.\nInput: This picture depicts what type of weather? Choices:  1. Calm 2. Clear 3. Foggy 4. Snowstorm 5. Clear and cold\nRationales: Identify the weather type that one sees in the picture: Calm, Clear, Foggy, Snowstorm. \nIdentify each of the answer choices and see if they describe the weather in the picture.\nStart to eliminate each incorrect option. \nEliminate the choices that sound", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "was planting a seed, it came out a root. Choices: A: tomatoes B: plants C: tree D: grass E: bamboo\nRationales: First, we have an explanation of what \"she sure didn't have\" implies, a negative connotation. This means that she lacks the skill to properly grow plants and vegetables.\nThe second consideration relates to the answer choices. The answer is most likely the one that contradicts what was mentioned about the person in the paragraph. \nEach answer choice was considered: tomatoes, plants, bamboo, and grass. Each has the possibility of being the correct answer, but only one is what's stated in the paragraph.\nPlants are indeed plants, but this would not counteract what was stated about \"never being able to garden.\"\nBamboo is another type of plant, but the fact that the statement mentions \"a seed\" excludes this answer.\nFinally, grass is a type of plant, so it's included in the choices, but again, \"a seed\" indicates that it refers to something else, so this cannot be the correct answer.\nTherefore, the only remaining answer is option D: grass. When it comes to the phrase \"she thought she was planting,\" the only correct answer choice is the one that contradicts the statement. This indicates that the answer is D: grass.\nAnswer: DGrass\n\nInput: How did he become a lawyer? Choices: A: he passed the bar exam B: he graduated from law school C: he married a lawyer D: he passed the exam E: took a class\nRationales: The first step is to consider the overall intention of the passage. The sentence asks us to focus on specific details or information related to answering the question. We don't need the passage's overall idea. \nLet's continue, by looking at the answer choices. \nHe passed the Law Exam: This option can be excluded immediately, since it's not mentioned in the question.\nHe married a lawyer: This option can also be excluded as it contradicts the statement related to passing the exam given that they would have passed the exam before marrying the lawyer.\nHe took a class: this option is similar to the other one, as it contradicts the exam and would have occurred before the exam and marriage.\nHence, the", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "planted it, it was dead by the next day Choices:  A. tomato plant B. flower C. orange D. apple E. radish\nRationales: Understand what's being asked. In this case, there is a pattern that indicates a negative correlation of planting and the day after.\nDetermine the nature of the relationship. In this case, it is a negative correlation, which means that the next day after planting should happen to be the death of the plant: not necessarily every time but there is a probability that it will happen.\nThe context clues can tell you that the situation is such that it is unlikely that the condition can be attributed to the plant.\nExclude irrelevant options. The options can be excluded based on the nature of the relationship between planting and death.\nDetermine which is more probable. In this case, because the relationship is negative, the death of the plant is more probable than its successful growth: C and E are not the most probable choices based on the relationships presented in the context.\nIdentify the most probable choice. By determining that the death of the plant or its being successful is more likely to occur, the answer can be deduced to be B. A and D are out as their relationship is positive. C and E are not likely to occur. This is because there is more likelihood that the next day after should be either the success or the death of the plant (which are both negative, based on the relationship of cause and effect).\nAnother factor that can point to the right answer can be that the pattern is not complete. The pattern of death or growth should have been seen repeatedly, which would only have been a good basis for an inference of some kind of relationship. If we assume that the sample size was very small and incomplete, then A, D, and E can be crossed off.\n\nAnswer: C: orange\n\nInput: What did the cow do when his farm is lost in storm? Choices: 1. A.

D: She was neglecting the plant. E She was using the wrong fertilizer.\nRationales: Every time she thought she would get it to grow, it was dead by morning (choice A). The obvious solution to this problem is to choose the right plant that is suited for her environment and care (choice C), and provide proper care. Another possibility is to simply try again with another plant (choice B). However, these are not the only possibilities. \n1. She could be neglecting the plant by watering too frequently (choice D), or not providing enough water (choice E).\n2. It's possible that she is using the wrong type of fertilizer (choice B), which is causing the plants to die (choice E).\n3. It's also possible that she is watering the wrong plant with the right watering schedule. Some plants require more water, and others require less, so it could be possible that she is waterng a plant that requires less water, but watering it more diligently (rather than using a plant that requires less.)\n4. The answer (D) is that she was neglecting the plant by overwatering it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYou may find writing instruction questions a tricky task.

{"text": "started a plant it died. Choices:  A) it just died B) drowned C) it didn't like it D) it turned black E) it didn't have seeds\nRationales: Here we can see a common idiom used to mean that a person is not talented at a certain activity. \nA) it just died - If a person was having trouble with plants, and just said it \"died\" without giving any details, you could assume they are not talented at gardening.\nB) drowned - This does not sound like the same phrase as \"not having a green thumb\".\nC) it didn't give seeds - In plant biology, a \"seed\" is considered a living organism that has the potential to grow into a plant. This phrase does not describe a seed, nor does it say how the organism died.\nD) it turned black - In some plants, turning black is part of their life cycle and the result of exposure to extreme light. This does not seem to be the correct meaning of the phrase.\nE) it just died - This is the most specific and accurate example of the idiom \"not having a green \"thumb\" and the correct answer.\nSo the answer is E) not having a green thumb.\nAnswer: E) not having a Green thumb\n\nInput: Who is a person who is well versed in science or math?

To be \"smart\" about something doesn't necessarily mean having knowledge about it.\nB) curious - In science or math, curiosity is an important trait, but it's a personality trait, not an overall understanding of the subjects.\nC) stupid - Stupidity is the opposite of smartness, but the question does not expressly ask for the opposite.\nD) good at math - A good math student can be good at math but being good at math doesn't mean they're also good at it in general. \nE) wisest - In its", "answer": " 15"}

E: shrubs\nRationales: First, it's important to understand what a \"green thumb\" is. It's someone who has a knack for growing plants and has a good success rate in planting things.\nSecond, we can start eliminating the option choices by seeing which ones are not commonly associated with the term \"green thumb.\"\n1. Option A: vegetables is often associated with gardening, so if we assume the phrase \"every time she thought she plant\" refers to actually planting vegetables, the answer should be A.\n2. However, the term \"didn't have a green\" thumb suggests the person does not have success with planting vegetables, so option A is eliminated.\n3. Option B: flowers is very commonly associated with gardening and would be a valid option if \"plant\" was associated with growing flowers rather than vegetables. But since the question states that the person doesn't have a green thum, it's unlikely that the person is focused on growing flowers.\n4. Option C: fruits may not be associated with gardening, but fruits and vegetables are often grown together, and some people may specialize in growing fruiting plants. Furthermore, the person in the question has a green thumb, meaning they are skilled in planting and growing. This suggests that they could grow fruiting plants. Therefore, option C is eliminated as a possibility.\n5. Option D: herbs is often a type of plant used to flavor food, so this option would not be associated with growing a green thumb.\n6. The sentence suggests that the person is trying to grow something and it's not working, so it's unlikely that they would have a successful track record of growing herbs. Therefore, option D is eliminated.\n7. Option 6: shrubs is commonly associated with gardening, and if the term \"vegetable\" is associated with planting, the phrase \"every time\" would make sense if referring to growing vegetables. However, the question refers to fruit, so the answer is probably not C, shrubs.\n8. Eliminating all the previously-discarded choices leaves us with option E", "answer": " 0"}

{"text": "was doing what to her own plants? Choices:  C: watering them D: feeding them E: fertilizing them F: replanting them\nRationales: When people want to learn about gardening, they often ask \"What plants can I grow?\" and \"What is the best way to care for my plant?\" The word that describes the action of caring for plants is \"maintain.\" The correct answer choice is therefore D: feeding them.\n\nTo ask people what they enjoy or care about in their lives is often to discover a passion or hobby. If someone says that they enjoy cooking, you can assume that they like cooking for their friends, cooking for themselves, or eating the food they cook, but you can't assume which of these activities they actually enjoy most or why. The word that describes the enjoyment of cooking is \"delight\". The three most likely activities that a person delights in are cooking for themselves, cooking for friends, and eating the food they have prepared. Therefore, the answer choice is C: cooking for themselves.\n\nWhen an animal bites someone and breaks their skin, the skin will often become infected and turn red and swollen, causing pain and inflammation. To relieve some of the pain and swelling, a person might apply ice and wrap the wound in a bandage. When people are injured in their skin, the word they use to describe the action of relieving the pain and swelling is \"ease.\" The answer is therefore E: ease.\n\nThe word \"sting\" is used to describe the pain and swelling caused by some insect bites. After an insect bites a person, she often applies something to the wound in order to soothe and ease the sting. When a person rubs something on their wound, the word that describes the action is \"rub.\" The correct answer therefore is C: rubbing it.\n\nAn important consideration in choosing a place to live or work is having access to various amenities and facilities. To choose an apartment building, someone would look at the amenities it offers, such as a nearby location and a reliable elevator. Amenities are the perks or benefits that come with a place.

We can determine that this phrase means she had a lack of skill in gardening, which is confirmed by the remainder of the sentence: every time she thought she'd going to do something to it, it failed or died.\nNow, consider each option and determine what might be meant by the phrase: every time she thought. \nOption A: garden. She might not have a green thumb, but she surely has the skills to garden. Therefore, this choice is ruled out.\nOption B: plant. This is the same as to garden, so this choice is not likely.\nOption C: landscape. This is not a failure, but it could be considered a dying on her part, as no one wants to look at a wasted landscape.\nOption D: Lawn. This option is also not a failure or a dying.\nOption E: house. This could be related to a green thumb; it could also be a failure or a dying, but it doesn't appear to be what is meant by the phrase \"every time.\" Hence, this choice could be eliminated. \nWe can conclude that green thumb means gardening skills, and the phrase \"every time she thought she was doing something to it\" suggests that she lacked those skills, which make \"plant\" our likely answer. \nAnswer: Plant\n\nInput: Their teacher gave them all a grade, what did the teacher want the children to do?

It follows this person has been attempting to take care of garden plants (flowers, herbs, and shrubs; these are all plants).\nThe next step is interpreting each answer choice for the context provided in the sentences. In this question, the answer choice must be a common problem that one would have with plants in the same situation. Plants are not meant to be withered and to wither is to wilt or fade.\n \n6. Choice A: Shrubs could be a plant, but shrub is not a common plant that would wither or wilt.\n7. Choice B: Roses could be a plant, and flowers are not generally meant to wither but they are meant to fade. Choice B has an issue with the choice as well, as roses do not necessarily lose their petals when left out, so it\u2019s not as common as choosing the correct answer choice. \n8. Choice D: Plants could be a plant, could not wither, and could not wither if wiled, so there is not an issue of having the wrong answer choice. \n9.

{"text": "was doing good she would end up with what? Choices: 1. A: red thumb B: white thumb C: black thumb D: broken thumb E: injured thumb\nRationales: First, we should understand the context of the question and the meaning of the words.\n1. A \"green thumb\" is a name for someone who has a successful track record of growing plants, especially with gardening or similar activities.\n2. A \"green thumb \" is supposed to indicate someone is good at growing things and/or gardening.\n3. The term \"green thumb\" usually has a positive connotation in popular culture.\n4. A person who does not have a green thumb would be considered inept or unsuccessful in gardening and plant-related endeavors.\n5. The choice list consists of six options each representing what a person's thumb will look, but each one has the incorrect meaning, except for red.\n6. A white thumb doesn't mean good or successful at gardening, it is the paler version of a green thumb, as in very pale, sickly, etc.\n7. A black thumb indicates someone who has a very bad experience with gardening, which seems to contradict the meaning of the phrase \"she thought she was doing good\".\n8. A broken thumb means someone's thumb is broken, which doesn't fit with the phrase \"every time she thought she was\", as it's not about being broken, but about the failure to maintain a good, green thumb.\n9. An injured thumb is a more severe level of injury than a broken thumb, so it doesn't indicate failure. Also, like a broken thumb, this injury can happen during the process of attempting to grow garden.\n10. So, the only remaining option is A: red thumb, as its connotation is that it's pale, which fits the other criteria.\nAnswer: A red thumb\n\nInput: The man was able to get on the train.

This suggests that she was probably trying and doing something incorrectly (with a poor \"green thumb\"). A green thumb refers to having a talent for gardening. So, one who is successful in gardening would be said to have a green thumb. One who lacks this ability, on the other hand, could be mistaken for trying to help something, then ending up harming it, which makes them seem like one would have had a green thumb\n\nAnswer: B: drive car\n\nInput: Which kind of thing would only need a certain color, not matter what?

She couldn't keep a straight face at the dinner table when he would say things and then pretend someone else came.\nRationales: First, understand the context of the sentence. It contains a narrative about an individual who has a boyfriend with different opinions and characteristics. The sentence also contains many details that may confuse the reader and could mislead them, so it's important to look at them critically. \n1. The narrative talks about an individual complaining (about the plants) after getting angry. This suggests that the plants require frequent watering. \n2. The narrative talents about the individual, who also gets angry when their boyfriend \"complains about the plants.\" \n3. Therefore, the answer choice should include a description related to watering the plants. \n4. Choice A, Green thumb, is inappropriate. It's not a characteristic that relates to the previous narrative details. \n5. Choice B, Watering, is a possible answer, because it's a characteristic related to plants, but we know this is not the narrative's focus; instead, it focuses on the boyfriend.\n6. Choice C, Boyfriend would \"complain about the plants,\" sounds too generic, because \"complain\" does not describe the boyfriend's actions or mannerisms. \n7.

The phrase \"where was the event likely to\" implies that we are looking for the venue that is most likely to fit the description of the event. \nNext, we need to consider the location of an upcoming event, such as an assembly, sports match, concert, etc. \nThen we can look at the options to identify the most appropriate answer. \nOption A: Church. This is not a common venue for an assembly, so this can be excluded.\nOption B: School. Schools serve as locations for events and assemblies, so we can disregard this option.\nOption C: Gymnasium. Gyms can be appropriate venues for assemblies, so this seems like a likely option, but we need to exclude other options by considering them. \nOption D: Theater. The word \"theater\" suggests a venue for a performance, not an assembly. \nOption E: Stadium. This seems like a suitable venue for a large-scale event that requires a lot of space.

Growing \"flowers\" would be more applicable if the question involved the intent to grow plants indoors, since flowers would be less of a commitment than trees, but mushrooms are a type of plant, so the answer could possibly include mushrooms. \"Spouses\" seems out of place, but since pets and bugs can be added to the garden and can be referred to in terms of \"growing\", we'll consider both option as well.\n2. Now, compare each option to the context provided in the question.\n3. Let's start with option A, \"trees.\" Trees are an unusual choice for growing in a garden for a few reasons:\n4. Firstly, gardening is typically associated with plants that can be grown in smaller spaces, such as flowers and vegetables. Trees are often grown outside, in spaces too large to be considered part of a typical garden.\n5. Secondly, trees are typically not grown as indoor plants, they require a much bigger space, and their lifespan is generally longer than that of most garden plants.\n6. Finally, trees tend to be fairly expensive and require a lot of care and maintenance compared to other types of plants.\n7. Therefore option A is excluded.\n8. We could consider option B: flowers. Flowers are often grown in gardens and are appropriate for outdoor spaces. However, option B is excluded due to the fact that it's unlikely that one could think they were growing fruits and vegetables if they were in fact growing flowers.\n9. We'll now compare option C: \u201cspouses\u201d. Spouses may be a natural choice as something that could be grown. However, option C is excluded due to lack of commitment compared to the fruits and vegetables the previous plantings started to rot, as spouses tend to have a long lifespan and require a lot of maintenance.\n10. Option D: pets. Unlike option C, option D seems like it might work. Pets can definitely be considered the type of things one can grow, and they require care", "answer": " 125"}
{"text": "knew about plants, she was trying to kill them. Choices:  A, B, C\nRationales: We start by eliminating the choices:\n1. A: This choice is an example of a \"green thumb\": having a talent or skill in gardening or plant care. It does not fit with the meaning described in the sentence, which is that she was always trying to hurt or kill the plants, not take care of them.\n2. B: In this case, \"She sure didn't have\" could mean that she did not have the necessary skills to care for plants. This would explain why she was always trying to kill them. This choice might work.\n3. C: This choice does not fit with the description in the sentence as it implies that she intentionally tried to hurt the plants. This option would not explain why she had a habit of killing plants.\nThe answer is B that she was trying to kill the plants, not to green thumb.\n\nInput: They like to play the guitar, they were going to try and join the band. Choices:  B, D, E\nRationales: The question asked about the specific action of \"trying\" to join the band. \n1. We consider each option one by one. \n2. Option A: this choice is not likely to be a good match. \nIt could be that the group they wanted to join allowed them to practice with them, but that wasn't what the question asked. \nTherefore, option A is not an appropriate response.\n3. Option B: we have to consider this option carefully and consider if they have the skills required to join the group.\n4. From a literal perspective, this choice makes sense, and it's possible that the band would be interested in trying out a new guitarist.\n5. However, it's important to remember the goal of the sentence is to identify the correct action. \n6. Option D, \"trying to join a band\" makes more sense after careful consideration. This option represents the true goal, so B: trying to join a band is a correct selection.\nAnswer: B try to join a band.\n\nInput: His idea for the experiment was to use a magnet, not a metal bar.

{"text": "had grown what, she ate it right? Choices:  The question asks us to identify what this person didn't have.\nRationales: Our job here is to choose the answer that makes the most sense given the context of the example sentence. Our answer should fit logically with the example sentence, not contradict it.\n\nThere are two options: Choices: A: skills and B: plants.\n\nStart with Option A: skills. This option does not make sense in the context of the question. It is not unusual for people to lack certain skills, but for someone who thought she had grown a plant to eat it without knowing, it does not make sense.\n\nContinue with Option B: plants. This option is the correct response. It is logical to conclude that if someone thought she had grown a successful plant, and every time she thought she grew a plant, she would eat it, then she likely did not have a green thumb.\n\nAnswer: B: plants\n\n### Test Yourself\n\nInput:  Whenever something is happening, I am usually reading the daily newspaper. What are you doing? Choices:  I need to eat, I am preparing to head outside, I am listening to music, I am going to do some chores, I am getting ready for a walk\nRationales: Choices: A question is presented to us in which we need to choose what one person is doing when something happens. We start by looking at the answers to determine which are less and more likely to be correct.\n\nStart with Choice A: need to eat. This makes little sense because she would still want to read the newspaper.\n\nContinue to Choice B: preparing to head outside. This makes sense because she would want to take the newspaper with her.\n\nContinue further to Choice C: listening to music. She would want to read the newspaper while she does this.\n\nContinue even further to Choice D: doing some chores. Although she might want to finish the newspaper, she could also be doing chores while reading the newspaper and could answer both of these.\n\nContinue again to Choice E: getting ready for a walk. She would want to finish reading the newspaper before going for a walk.\n\nWe can now see that these are choices are increasingly more likely to be correct, whereas, all previous answers are less likely. Therefore, our answer is", "answer": " 186"}
{"text": "was getting close she got what? Choices: A: poison ivy B: bad luck C: a pig\nRationales: We want to choose a word that fits the first phrase \"She sure didn't have...\" A phrase like \"a green thumb\" would describe someone with a certain quality, but this doesn't seem to be the case for this person. \n1. Starting with B: bad luck. This could be a word we might usually use to describe someone who isn't good at gardening, but it doesn't convey a sense of a lack of ability, which is suggested by the first phrase.\n2. Next, we consider C: a pig. A pig is an animal, so it isn't appropriate to use as an answer.\n3. Moving on to A: poison ivy. The phrases \"got too close to\" and \"tried to get close,\" along with the second phrase \"She sure didn\u2019t have...\" all suggest that this person is unsuccessful in their attempts to grow and care for plants. It's almost as though the plants themselves are working against her and she has an inability to cultivate them properly. Poison ivy, in particular, can be difficult for some people to garden with, due to its potential for contact dermatitis. It fits well with the image of the plants working against this person's efforts.\n4. Therefore, the correct choice is A: poison ivy as it reflects an inability to grow and care for greenery and the image of plants as enemies that sabotage this person's attempts.\nAnswer: A : poison ivy\n\nInput: In the winter, are apples sweet? Choices: A; yes B: no C: yes\nRationales: The question seems straightforward at first, asking whether apples are sweet in the winter. But on closer examination, it becomes apparent that this statement does not necessarily make sense, as apples are a fruit that can be grown and harvested throughout the year. \n1. Let's start with Choice A - \"yes.\" This answer would imply that apples are sweet only during specific seasons, such as the winter, but if this is the case, there would be no need to ask the question in the first place.\n2. Choice B - \"no,\" on the other hand, doesn't make sense, as fruits", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": "had it made, she would give up. Choices:  A. gardening B. soccer C. cooking D. painting E. running\nRationales: Steps to completing this: 1. Understand the question 2. Interpret each choice as an appropriate answer 3. Select the correct answer and describe why it is correct \n### Instruction\nShe sure didn't have (her) a green thumb. Every time she thought she had (it) it made, she would it give up.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo identify the answer, it's important to understand the meaning of \"green thumb\" and \"it.\" The phrase \"a green thumb\" refers to a person with a natural ability or talent for gardening or plant care, and therefore, it being given up means she was not able to maintain or cultivate her gardening abilities.\n\nIn terms of the choice options, gardening (choice B) probably would involve some level of gardening, which could fit with the sentence, and \"give up\" suggests that she wasn't successful in the endeavor. This does suggest that she has a \"green thumb,\" but that doesn't necessarily mean that she was talented in gardening in general, as B is the answer here.\n\n### Rationale\nShe gave up gardening, and she did have a green thumb. This seems to be implying that gardening was not a talent of hers, as she gave up on it and had a \"green thumb.\" This would then lead us to the conclusion that she should have excelled at it but didn't.\n\n### Answer\nBased on the evidence provided above, the best answer is B: gardening, as it means she had a \"green thumb,\" indicating she excelled at a talent she should have had.\n\nWe can describe why this is correct as follows:\n\nShe believed she was talented at gardening, but she gave up on it. This would lead us to believe that she was not talented at gardening.\n\nAnswer: B: gardening\n\nInput: If you were getting your hair cut, it would be trimmed first, what is it cutter for?

{"text": "was succeeding the flower would die. Choices:  A) was not good at gardening B) loved to keep nature C) hated nature D) was an introvert E) could not keep a job\nRationales: In this example, the sentence \"She sure didn't have green thumb, everytime she thought she was succeedig the flower would die.\" In this sentence, we can interpret \"She definitely did not have a green thumb\", which means that she was not good at gardenning. \"She was good at something else\", which could be true for example \"She was good at saving money\" or \"She was good at playing football\" so here, we can eliminate option A, B & C, as they are not logical according to the text content.\nWe can also know \"every time she thought she was going do the right thing... the flower would die\", which means she was very unstable and every time she wanted to do the right thing... then the flower would die. So, we can eliminate option D, according to the content of the text. This would leave E, which implies that the person does not do well at school or work. \"She did this very well \" means the person does not do bad at school or work or in other activities.\nSo, answer is E. \nAnswer: E: was not good at keeping a job\n\nInput: What are you trying to do when the person is having what? Choices:  a)  a heart attack b)  pain c)  death  d)  happiness e)  fear\nRationales:In this sentence, it can be inferred that \"The person that has to have a heart attack\". \"You are trying to do all you can to avoid any pain that has to be felt if their is a heart attack\". If you understand their, then you might have thought that: \na) What are you trying to avoid, pain? Why not death?\nb) What are you actually trying to avoid death, not pain.\nc) What are you trying avoid then? It is death.\nTherefore, \"avoid death\" means to avoid being dead. Which means that the answer is C, \"the person is having a heart attack \". \nAnswer: C: having a heart attack \n\nInput: In which building you live? There are two houses A and B, which you own.

{"text": "had finally made it, things just didn't work out! What is it called to do something a bunch of times but don't get it right? Choices: 0. A: work ethic  B: perseverance  C: luck\nRationales: We'll first parse through the question.\n1. \"She sure didn't have\" implies that the subject has tried repeatedly but failed, so we know that \"a bunch of times\" is the correct answer and not just any amount of times.\n2. The second part of the sentence introduces a second subject: \"everything just didn't work.\" We're already familiar with the first subject, \"she,\" so we can assume that \"things\" refers to those first subject and not a third subject.\n3. Moving into the options.\n4. Choice A: Work ethic. The choice refers to \"work\" which we know is incorrect because it's not the subject.\n5. Choice B: persevered. We know this is true for subject (she)\" because she tried repeatedly.\n6. Choice C: Luck. This is the exact opposite of perseverance because it refers to luck that she didn't get things right, not perseverance.\n7. Therefore it is C: Luck\nAnswer: C: Luck\n\nInput: What job was the best option for her to do to afford her education? Choices: 1. A: sales 2. B: factory 3. C: teacher 4. D: hospital 5.

Option A says \u201csales\u201d. She can do sales after school to start paying for her education. However, sales is not a high-paying job and may not cover all her fees. If this is the case, she may need an additional job such as a waiter/waitress or even factory.\n\n3. Option B says \u201cfactory\u201d. She could", "answer": " 2400"}
{"text": "'d keep it alive, something terrible happened. Choices:  A. kill it at birth B. leave it in the sun to die C. water it D. neglect it E. give up\nRationales: First, we need to consider the context in which this sentence is being used. \nSecondly, we have to eliminate options that are unrelated to the question. So, options that can be eliminated: A. Kill it at birth; B. Leave it in the sun to Die; E. Give up.\nNext, we have to identify the options that best fit the sentence and eliminate any that don't.\nIn this case, we can eliminate choice D: Neglect it. This option suggests taking no action towards maintaining or tending to a living thing, such as plants in this case. It doesn't indicate any sort of failure or misstep that leads to the \"terrible\" situation we're asked about.\nOption C. Water it, while still having some connection to plant care, this word choice makes it too generic and open for any type of \"terrible\" situation such as choosing water when the plant needs something else.\nOnly 2 options left: A. Kill it (which we've already eliminated as not making sense for the context) and B. Leave it (which suggests not doing anything to it at all). It makes the most sense to eliminate B as leaving it to die is also not what we're asked about, but the \"unfortunate\" situation we're told about is killing it.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Kill it at Birth.\nAnswer: A. Kill it Birth.\n\nInput: What did the person choose after hearing the song was only 17 years old? Choices:  Hated it A. Made it famous B.

The sentence implies someone new to a song would be unlikely to make it famous or popular. It's more likely to hear about someone who made it famous.\nB. Says he never her of the artist.

{"text": "started seeing results it seemed to fail. Choices:  A green thumb is a skill of gardening. B: to be lazy. C: not know what they are doing. D: to get old. E: to make a mistake.\nRationales: step 1. The phrase \"green thumb\" refers to having a skill in gardening.\n2. B: is not related to gardening or any skill, so she is not \"lazy.\" Therefore, B:, to be lazy, can be eliminated.\n3. We now consider each other option: C, D, and E.\n4. C: not knowing what you're doing: can imply having no skill or laziness, but it also relates to not having the appropriate or correct knowledge about how to do something, not necessarily being unable to do something.\n5. D: getting old: could be related to gardening skills, as older generations are often considered more skilled at gardening than younger ones.\n6. However, there are also other possible interpretations of the phrase, such as age-related decline or physical disability. \n7. Therefore, we can eliminate the option D: getting old as the best answer.\n8. E: to make mistakes: is related to gardening, as one can make mistakes and/or have less precision in their gardening.\n9. This implies a skill, not necessarily laziness, so E: can be considered as the possible answer.\n10. While the options C and D can both be eliminated, option E: to make mistakes may be a reason why she can't develop a green thumb.\n11. But her intentions of starting a garden project, implied in the phrase, \"it seemed to fail\" indicate that she may not have a green thumb. This indicates that, although there are potential mistakes, they have the potential to lead to failure.\n12. Therefore, the best option is B: to be lazy, as it doesn't necessarily indicate a lack of knowledge or skill, but a person's potential or willingness to do the work to develop a skill.\n13. It is important to consider that just because \"everything she did failed\" doesn't mean she \"was lazy\", it could also indicate that she made mistakes.\n14.

{"text": "did something wrong she felt blue Choices: A: felt red B: felt orange C: felt yellow D: felt pink E: nothing\nRationales: The sentence implies that she believes herself to be doing something wrong, which makes her feel blue. This feeling is probably because she's blaming herself for not being good at something.\nHere are some thoughts that might help you to come up with a better answer:\n1. To \"feel\" means to experience something as a sensation to the body. \"Green thumb\" is a common colloquial term, but it doesn't have much to do with blame or guilt. It's more about being good at something. Therefore, it doesn't make sense that the person feels guilt or blame because they don't have a green (good) thumb.\n2. The sentence states that every time the person \"thought\" they were doing something wrong, it made them feel blue. This means that their thoughts played a role in making them feel that way, not their physical state.\n3. Looking at the answer choices, it seems like the literal meaning of a color might be more relevant. \"Red\" and \"Orange\" are colors that could have a meaning in this scenario, but they don't seem to match the phrase \"She sure didn't have\". Additionally, it's unlikely that she could be feeling a shade of pink.\n4. \"Blue\" is an emotional state that could be felt by someone who believes that they are doing something wrong.

This context refers to \"she\" and not \"the plants\" as the question asks. \n1. A) \"she died\" does not make sense and could not be the answer.\n2. B) \"she died\" could be the answer but only if she died specifically because of growing plants. Again, this doesn't make sense and therefore cannot be the answer.\n3. C) \"The plants died\" is a possible answer as it shows a clear result of the thought experiment. However, we need to be certain that these specific plants are the only ones that died. If other plants in the same environment died, then they might have died for other reasons than the person's thinking they will make profit. \n4. D) \"she did it by accident\" is a possible answer. If the plants were affected by any unforeseen circumstances, then one could speculate that the person's thoughts led to this outcome, making this option viable. However, this might not be the correct answer as the plants in this example were not affected by any other events besides the person's thinking.\n5. E) \"She could\" refers to the possibility that the person could actually make profit by growing plants, which contradicts the context of the sentence. Therefore, this option is not a viable answer.\n6. This leaves us with C) \"she quit.\" If she quit, even after trying multiple times and making some profit, then it shows that a person attempting to make a profit by planting only needs to fail once.

She obviously didn't have one and is confused because she thought she was doing the correct things (it turned out to be a \"cactus\"). This means she did the opposite of what someone would do to have a green plant. If she didn't fertilize it, then the opposite is she did fertilise it.

Understanding the problem statement allows us to determine the possible answer choices in this context. \n1. To grow plants, one should use soil, sunlight, and water, which we know from the first description. \n2. From there, we can move on to reading each of the response options to find the correct answer. \n3. The correct answer should be that doesn't have a green that does not fit or align with the context. \n4. Using the question itself, we should eliminate (J): grass because grass is green, we could consider (L): vines and (S): trees. \n5. For (L): vines, we know vines do not grow in soil, which means that one would consider it a green thumb as it would provide a solution to an issue. \n6. For (S): trees, we know we would consider someone to have a green thumb as trees can grow from seeds. \n7. We can eliminate (J): grass as it is too vague to provide the answer, (S): trees as they do not need that much attention, and (T): flowers as they can be grown in soil. \n8. This means we can eliminate most of the options as they do not match or have the opposite requirements as what we're looking for. \n9. As a result, the only answer is (L): vines as it does not have the features of growing in soil.\nAnswer: L: vines\n\nInput: The car needed more gas but the owner only had 5 cents.

A) rain is not probable. B) flowers aren't very likely to be grown at the same time that spring snows. If it snowed, it would likely be too cold for flowers in the spring. C) floods is not a probable consequence. This type of weather has the opposite effect of what would happen if it snows, as snow can occur in the fall or winter and is indicative of bad weather. Therefore, floods are unlikely. D) The sentence does not imply that there is a likely outcome of wind.

{"text": "had the idea why? Choices: 1. A: water B: plant C: dirt D: sun E: pot\nRationales:1. To understand the question, we should first consider the context. The phrases \"green thumb\" and \"every time\" imply that she is attempting to do something related to gardening or landscaping.\n2. To find the answer, we should analyze each option based on its connection to gardening or land-scaping and its relevance to the \"every time\" phrase.\n3. Choice A: water. Water is obviously an essential factor in gardening and landscaping, but it's a common factor that is easily controlled and not unique to each specific gardening event. Moreover, although water can be supplied to a plant, it's typically the gardener who is responsible for watering their garden, making it less connected to the phrase \"every time\" the gardener thought they had a promising idea.\n4. Choice B: plant. Although plants are essential in gardening and land-scaping, they are also easily controlled by the gardener. Water can be consistently supplied to the plant, dirt can be frequently added and replaced, and location can be customized through the type of pot chosen. These aspects eliminate this option from being the correct one. \n5. Choice C: dirt. The option of dirt is similarly discarded as the gardener can easily customize the dirt in their garden, and it is a common factor in gardening that is easily controlled by the gardner and does not represent a promising or specific idea. Moreover, this option is not particularly related to the question about why she \"thought she had the idea.\" \n6. Choice B: pot, is a plausible answer, as it represents a specific, custom-created form for a plant to grow in. However, the wording of the question suggests that she \"thought she understood,\" which suggests that she believed she understood how and what to do, rather than simply the option of providing customized care for a plant. \n7. We are left with choice D: Sun, which accurately describes the gardener as responsible for providing the \"green thumb\" necessary for successful gardening. Sunlight is also essential to plant growth, and represents a specific gardening factor that the gardener must provide, implying the phrase \"every time.\" Therefore, the", "answer": " 84"}

Answer may either be a common synonym (e.g. A. green thumb) or a phrase with a different and unexpected meaning (e.g. D. black thumb).\n3. Although it may seem that some answer choices do not make sense (E. brown thumb), it should be noted that sometimes in a riddle, the trick answer is the most straightforward option (D. black thumb).\n4. However, D. black thumb is the answer in this case: the author may have purposely used a nonsensical phrase to trick their reader. \n5. We can then consider the other answer choices.\n6. It should be noted that A. green thumb is a common phrase. It may be easier for some to interpret a figurative meaning than it is for others, but this is not the best option in this case. \n7.

This means that each time she had a \"successful\" garden, it meant that the garden withered away. The sentence also seems to indicate that the \"successful\" garden was unsuccessful based on the verb \"failed\" in the sentence.\nAnswer:\n\nInput: He was wearing a suit that he didn't like, he's wearing a suit that fits him well.

The first sentence tells us that someone is wearing a suit that they don't like. The second sentence now provides us information about what they are not wearing.\nThe answer in this case is A.

{"text": "was doing her plants good, it ended in her yard dying. Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales:\n1. It is important to carefully read and understand the context of the sentence before evaluating possible choices. The sentence describes a situation where the subject, She, always fails at her plant-watering attempts, resulting in yard deaths instead.\n2. The five possible choices are A: The sky is blue, B: She is beautiful, C: She has no talent, D: She can't change, and E: She is unlucky.\n3. Choice of A: The sky is Blue is not related to the context of the sentence.\n4. Choice B: She is beautiful. Also does not have anything to do with the subject matter.\n5. Choice C: She has no Talent, is excluded as the sentence implies that the subject has some skills in this area.\n6. Choice B: she can change, is similarly eliminated. Despite the subject's failure, the choice suggests that she is not in a position to be able to change or develop her abilities. \n7. The next choice that isn't eliminated is choice D: She can's change. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that she is unable or unwilling to improve her skills and succeed. \n8. Finally, the phrase \"every time\" can imply that she is trying to improve, despite her lack of natural talent, which would indicate that the subject is working to change her. Choice B: can't change is therefore not correct.\n9. Lastly, the only remaining option B: \"She is Unlucky\" accurately reflects the context and intention of the sentence. This is often associated with \"bad luck.\" It aligns with the idea that the subject's lack of success in gardening is due to external factors beyond her control.\n10. Therefore, the best response to this statement is \"She is Unluck.\"\nAnswer: B: She is unluck\n\nInput: We are going to the store, what type of store is best for those items?

The question asks us to choose the best answer to fill in the provided blank with reason. So, we should be looking at possible answers that explain why the lady does not have a green thumb. \n1. Option A. \"She had no talent for garden\" does not directly address the question; it only talks about an inherent ability to garden well rather than explaining why she did not have a green thumb in this situation.\n2. Option B. We know that \"she\" has a garden (she \"thought\" she has a garden). However, \"she had no garden\", so B makes no sense.\n3. Option C. She did not have a garden because she did not have the money to afford one. This answers the question directly and therefore is the best answer.\n4. Option D. Fertilizer has no correlation to the question. It has nothing to do with having a green or a yellow thumb. Therefore, it is irrelevant. \n5. Option E.

The first step in understanding the problem statement is to interpret the question.\n2. First, to understand what she did, we need to interpret the phrase \"Planted every time she thought she\u2026\" This means she planted seeds when she had these thoughts or ideas.

If she planted something she was allergic to, she could eat it, making this option incorrect. (She sure didn't have green thumb)\n6. Option B: She wouldn't eat what she thought about planting, which makes this option incorrect. (Everytime she thought she would put a vegetable, she would plant)\n7. Option C: this is not supported by our information. (She sure did not have green thumb)\n8. Option D: what she planted grew, but I've never seen produce from them.

We start by considering each option: A. Happy, B. Tired, C. Sad, D. Good, E. Bad\n2. Option E is not an appropriate response as \"die\" is not an emotion. \n3. Next, we consider option B. Though it could be a response, it implies that the woman is tired from thinking about dying. It doesn't match the scenario of her being happy when she \"was going to die\", making it an unlikely response. \n4. The same is true for option C; although it could be a response when someone thinks they are going to die, it doesn't align with the given scenario. \n5. Option D is not relevant to the question as \"good\" does not align with the scenario of being happy when one thinks they're going to die. \n6. Lastly, option A could be a possible response, but it doesn't accurately match the scenario of \"Every time she thought she was about to die....\" It implies that the woman was happy every time she thought about dying, which contradicts the statement that she thought she was going die every time.\n7.

{"text": "was doing something she should have been doing? Choices: A: baking B: taking care of herself C: thinking D: writing E: baking\nRationales: The question asks us to identify the most likely reason for the person's poor gardening skills. We need to consider each of five possible explanations that the author provides.\n1. Baking: baking is an activity that requires specific skills and expertise, and it's unlikely that the author would use this as a metaphor for gardening skills.\n2. Taking care of herself: if the author is referring to self-care activities, then the sentence could be interpreted as saying that the person is failing to take care of herself by neglecting gardening.\n3. Writing: writing is a creative and expressive activity, and while it may require careful planning and preparation, it's not necessarily a skill that is directly related to gardening or growing plants.\n4. Thinking: thinking is a cognitive process that requires mental effort, not physical action. It's unlikely that the person is referred to as a \"thinker\" or that baking is used as a metaphor of thinking in this situation.\n5. Baking: baked goods require a specific set of skills, materials, and preparation. To use the activity of baking as a metaphor to describe gardening skills would make little sense, it is a logical fallacy called equivocation.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that E: Baking, is not a likely option as it makes little sense to use this activity as a metaphor. Other options could be considered as possible answers, but the best answer is A - She Sure Didn't Have a Green Thumb: the author is referring to the person's lack of gardening skills in a literal sense, not as a metaphor, and it's clear that the author means the person's inability to grow or maintain a green thumb.\n7.

{"text": "'s planted she would kill the plant. What could be the problem? Choices:  B: too much sun C: too much dirt D: not enough dirt E: wrong F: too much water G: wrong plant\nRationales: Initially, the task instructs that the plant had likely been killed. So, \"She didn't have a plant\". It did not exist.\n1. The issue here is, that it's hard to say what the problem was at this moment in time so any response will have some level of \"guess\"? \n2. Therefore, based on the information it could have been that not enough soil or too much water could have lead to the plant not surviving, so we have option B: too much sun as a candidate. However, the sentence doesn't clarify if the plant had actually been killed or not, it might simply have been \"about to die\" in a moment of not enough water.\n3. So, if you consider that scenario, then having too much water might be an option as well.\n4. We also have the problem of the statement itself stating that the person thought she had planted in the right place. So, it could also be that what might be a problem could have been the wrong plant entirely.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nWe have seen several examples here, where it was hard to know what the right answer could be. In situations, like this, there is no way to know if any given answer will be right unless you guess. As a result, you'll often not know if any given option is the correct answer. Hence, it is not possible to say which answer is correct. \n\nWe have also seen how different possible answers can be connected in multiple ways to the given question. If the question is ambiguous, the answers can also be ambiguous. For this reason, it is important to question any question that is ambiguous.

{"text": "tried out planting something, but I see her in the garden pulling out little plants? Choices: \n  * A: good soil B: fertilizer C: fertilized soil D: green fingers E: raking\nRationales: When answering this question, we should first understand the sentence and its meaning, as well as identify all the details and information presented in the sentence. We have three options that may be the cause for the \"poor\" result - \"planting something\" (her fault), \"little plants\" (outside factors causing the problem) and \"garden pulling out little plants\" (nature does its job). In general, you can look in the dictionary and find the synonym for every action and reaction in the sentence and eliminate them accordingly. You should also check if their synonyms are in the question as there are certain hints as to the answer from these questions.\nNow, let's think about each option.\nA) \"good soil\" cannot work on its own while planting \"something\". A lot of work is involved and soil is just a base for it, not the entire process.\nB) \"fertilizer\" is not an action done by person; it can only be applied on the ground not necessarily under a plant.\nC) \"fertile soil\" means there has been no change and it implies there has been nothing done in the garden already.\nD) This is the only \"activity\" or action that can be considered, but it makes no sense since she has a green thumb (we could say that \"green finger\" refers to someone having good results of planting something, but we don't find such wordplay).

We have to interpret the words \"she has\" and \"every time she thinks she'd ___ flower ___.\"\nNow, consider each answer choice.\n1. A: green thumb. It does not represent the question accurately. It refers to a person with a natural ability to grow plants and flowers, not to someone who tries and fails.\n2. B: die. It does not represent what is asked in the question.\n3. C: drain. It represents part of the question, but not the whole. \"every time\" can still be interpreted. C is not the best answer.\n4. D: cut. It represents what happens every time the person tries to grow flowers.\n5. E: rot(en). It represents what happens everytime the person tries to grow plants.\n6. Therefore, D: cut(en) is the best answer.\nAnswer: D:(en) cut\n\nInput: What was the dog trying to do? Choices:  Answer: A: to fetch B: to bark C: to eat D: to bite E: to shake\nRationales: Understanding options.\n1. \"what was the dog doing\" asked us to interpret what the action was.\n2. Now, consider each answer choice and determine which represents the action the most.\n3. A: fetch. This can be interpreted as the action that is being asked about. The meaning is clear and concise.\n4. B: bark. This does not represent the action that should be interpreted. The word \"trying to do\", as given by the question, implies that the dog's action could be interpreted as doing something. B does not represent one trying to do something.\n5. C: eat. This could be potentially related to the action, but it is not the most suitable option, because \"to bite\" is a possible interpretation which represents what is being asked about.\n6. D: bite. It could be a representation of what is being asked, but it is not as concise and clear as the correct answer. \n7. E: shake. This does not represent what is being asked.\n8. Therefore.

{"text": "'d gotten it, it would die. Choices:  A. Her plant  B. Her plant in the container  C. Her plant on its own  D. Her plant on display  E. Her plant when it wasn't flowering\nRationales: She sure didn' be having a green thumb: the metaphor is suggesting she does not have an aptitude or talent for gardens. The text states that her plants die every time she attempts to keep one alive. This indicates that the issue likely is not with the quality of the plants she grows. The most probable issue is the way she keeps them, as it suggests she is careless in her gardening.\nAnswer: D. Her plant on a display is the most reasonable answer. D is the phrase we're looking for. This makes sense considering her green thumb. If she had a green thumb, she could grow plants easily. However, in this specific context, the issue is not the plants themselves. Instead, it is the way she keeps her plants. Placing the plants on a display suggests that she kept them in a position that increased the chances they would die.\n\n### Bonus:\n\nInput: The restaurant is closed on Monday and Tuesday, then what day do they close on Wednesday?

No, closing on Mondays and Tue means they close Mondays and Tuesday, no matter what day it is.\n2. Monday and Tuesday. The text states the restaurant closes Mondays and Tuesdsy, so they wouldn't close in a different order.

{"text": "was watering something it bloomed. Choices:  A green thumb B green finger C green fingerprint D green vegetable E green salad\nRationales: Choice A: green thumb - this is not a common expression. A \"green thumb\" is a saying for someone who is good at gardening, while \"green finger\" is a term used for a digit that is injured or deformed due to frostbite. Neither phrase makes the most sense in the stated context.\nChoice B: green finger. A \"green finger\" is the same as \"green thumb,\" already explained above.\nChoice C: green fingerprint. A \"green fingerprint\" does not make sense in the sentence.\nChoice D: green vegetable. A \"green vegetable\" is a vegetable that is colored green, but it is not specifically used for describing a green vegetable.\nChoice E: green salad. This makes the most sense as a \"green salad\" would be one that is green.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: green salad\n\nInput: Which of these can be played together with friends at a school concert? Choices:  Cello, Piano, Saxophone, Trumpet E Flute A Cello, Saxophone, Flute, Trumpet B Saxophone, Trumpets, Piano A Flute, Piano, Trumpet E String Quartet\nRationales:\nChoices A String Quartet and Cello: String quartet is the name of an ensemble of four stringed instruments, which can be violins, viola, and/or cello. Cello is a specific type of stringed instrument and is included in the string quartet but must be listed as a separate choice.\nChoices B Saxophone and Trumpets: Saxophone and trumpets are musical instruments that can be played together but do not fit with the wording \"with friends\" and the listed school concert.\nChoices C Flute, and Piano: Flute and piano can be played together and would fit the setting. However, they are both melodic instruments and cannot create harmony. They wouldn't exactly be \"played together with friends at a concert.\"\nChoices D Saxophone, Trumpes, Piano: This choice is acceptable, but it includes only musical instruments.

{"text": "might she would make what? Choices:  C: a flowerpot A: a flower D: a book B: a window E: a garden\nRationales: First, the task requires a specific choice according to the given instructions: \"every time she thought... \". \n1. \"Green thumb\" means being able to grow healthy plants. \n2. If someone doesn't have a green, they cannot have a green thumb. \n3. \"She sure didn't have one\" seems to imply her failures. \n4. \"Every time\" does not always mean a specific number of times, it can be interpreted more broadly as \"a significant number of times\". It could include many failed attempts over several years or over a short period. \n5. \"She would make a window\" is probably not a feasible or expected action for someone who is struggling with gardening skills. \n6. When we look at the other choices, \"a flower pot\" makes sense because it's a place to plant and grow plants. \"A flower\" is an object with flower-shaped parts that someone might try to grow in a flower pot. \"A book\" and \"a garden\" only make sense in the context of books and gardens, and there hasn't been a mention of these in the statement. \n7. Therefore, C: a flower pot is the correct answer. Answer: C: a flower pot\n\nInput: If you were a vegetarian, what would you never eat? Choices:  B: pastas  A: salads C: fruits D: cereals E: candy\nRationales: The task asks about what someone who is, or who is vegetarian would never eat. \n1. B: Pasta is not a vegetarian food item, and it will not be eaten by a person who is vegetarian.\n2. C: Fruits is a general food type that is suitable for vegetarians to eat.\n3. D. Cereals is a food item that does not have a definite classification as meat or vegetarian-friendly, so it can be considered for both cases.\n4. E: Candy is mostly not a vegetarian food due to the use of animal products, including sweeteners. Therefore, the answer would be A: salads, as salads are a vegetarian food item suitable.

{"text": "had her garden under control, her plants would wither and die. Choices:  A Green thumb B: Frown face C: Frown frown D: Frying face E: Grin face\nRationales: The first step is to interpret the sentence. \nStep 1: Understand what \"under control\" means. In this context, it implies that she thought she had a handle on her garden and was able to maintain it, but this was not the case. \nStep 2. Determine what that implies. Her plants wilted and died, which means that her garden was in a bad condition. \nStep 5: Fill in the blank. Choosing the correct answer should not be a matter of whether the answer is literal, but rather whether it fits grammatically and makes sense. \nStep 6: Eliminate the inappropriate answers. \nStep 7: Eliminate options inappropriate to her situation. \nStep 8: Evaluate the remaining options. A: green thumb, this does not fit in with \"she sure didn't\". Also, \"green thumb\" is not a negative phrase, implying her inability to manage her garden properly. \nStep 9: Choose B: frown face, this is the option that is most likely to provide the meaning intended by the answer. Choice C: frown frown is incorrect as it does not fit grammatically. \nStep 0: Check your answer. The phrase \"thought she had\" implies that she thought she was having success in her garden, but if she had a green thumb, she never would have thought that. Additionally, if she had a green  hand, she would have been able to do things that she could not do without one.\n\nAnswer: B: Frown face", "answer": " 2"}

The answer must match the tone and word choice of the question, using the same grammatical structure.\n2. If we could use only a single grammatical structure in the answer, B: not have any more chance would use the exact same structure as the question, but that does not make much sense grammatically or logically.\n3. A: Sure didn't use an incorrect structure, as it starts with'sure didn't' and ends with'sure didn\u2019t'. This makes no sense in terms of what follows and is therefore not a valid answer.\n4. D: She's sure no more chance use an incorrect structure as it starts with'she's sure' and ends with 'no more chance' or 'no chance'. \n5. Instead of being successful, she has a record of not been successful.\n6. The best answer is E: every time she thought she had a good/successful idea plants would die.\n7. This is grammatically sound and accurately represents the original question.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: What did she plan on doing? Choices: 28 A: cooking and eating B: eating C: reading D: running E: babysitting\nRationales: The answer is A: cooking and then eating. It is true that a person could do some or all of these things, but the correct answer should be specific to the sentence, i.e. cooking and then eatting.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: What does this show on your computer?

{"text": "'d plant something, it died.  Choices:  A. die B. plant C. sprout D. stay E. blossom\nRationales: Firstly, it should be pointed out that \"thought\" in the context refers to the person thinking of planting something, which means their plan was to plant, not that they have already planted something. \nSecondly, it needs to be considered if a \"plant\" is a living thing and is capable of dying. This implies that the green thumb is referring to whether a living thing will survive. This will be referred to in terms of living things that die. \nStep 1 Now check if the word that is related to planting, i.e. \"plant\" can be used in the sense of living or non-living. \nAnswer: It can only be used in the sense that a plant grows i.e. sprout or grow, which means living things are meant. \nStep 2 Now check what a plant dies means. It can be interpreted as \"dying\". \nThe opposite is \"growing\", hence plant is not going to grow. A living thing will not grow, but it will die. \nStep3 What does die can mean in this context? \nIt is clear that a thing that will die must not be a living thing. Hence, a word referring to dying has to relate to a non-living entity. \nStep4 Find the word here that is used as \"Non-living\" and check it against every answer: \nA: die is applicable. \nB: cannot be used as a non-living term in context. \nC: cannot be used as it does not make sense to sprout. \nD: same as above as it does not make natural sense to keep a thing. \nE: same as above is not applicable.\n\nAnswer: A die means a plant dies.

Choices:  A. didn't have B. wouldn't C. wouldn't die D. died\nRationales: The key to determining the correct answer to this riddle is to understand what the word \"green\" actually means.\nA green thumb is a talent for keeping plants alive. In general, a green thumb refers to someone who has a talent for nurturing and caring for plants.\nThis implies that someone with a green thumb should be able to keep plants alive, while someone without a green thumb should not be able to keep plants healthy and thriving.\nTo answer the question in context, we need to determine what the \"dream plant\" represents.\nThe first step is to associate the \"dream plant,\" which the riddle implies is significant to the subject, with each of the answer choices, in order to determine which option is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nBased on this assumption, we can eliminate C (wouldn't die) which has a double negative in the phrase (wouldn'ta/wouldn't).\nWe can also eliminate A (didn't have) because no matter how many times the person tried, the plant would not have lived.\nFinally, we can eliminate B (would/wouldn'nt) which implies that the person has never been successful at keeping plants alive.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is D (die), which accurately explains the subject's inability to keep any plant alive.\nAnswer: D die\n\nInput: \"Sir, I've a long story regarding the man I wish to arrest.

The focus is on the tree, not the person who's trying to water it. \n2. Next, interpret each option carefully. \n3. When it comes to watering, it's important to consider several factors, including root health, leaf health, and stem health. \n4. Root health and leaf health are part of stem health. Leaves are part of stems. Stems and leaves are different parts of the stem. These parts are related and the fact that they are separate would indicate that they are one part. \n5. Watering correctly for the root is important, making it the appropriate answer choice. \n6.

{"text": "planted something it would die. Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales: The question asks regarding the green thumb of a person. In this context, a green thumb refers to success in gardening. \n1. A plant's life is determined by many factors including soil quality, water, light, and climate. While these could be factors that affect an individual's success in gardening, they aren't necessarily related to a green thumb in general and could be considered external influences on success.\n2. B: she killed the seedlings. We don't know whether the gardening conditions were suitable, but this suggests that the issue could have been the gardener herself rather than environmental factors.\n3. D: she killed the plant. While this may or may not be related to external factors beyond the control of the gardener, this option doesn' to represent success in gardening and doesn't fit the context of the question.\n4. E: she killed the plant with poison. Again, whether it's related to environment or gardener's actions, poisoning the plants is a way of deliberately killing them. While this could be related to the gardener's actions or circumstances, it doesn't represent her actual ability or success in gardening.\n5. Therefore, the answer choices that represent environmental or biological factors affecting the plants are eliminated.\n6. To find the answer, the remaining choices should be compared. Both C and E refer to the gardener' killing the plants. However, C: she killed the seedling by pulling it out of the soil; this implies that the gardener knew she was killing it, but did so deliberately. On the other hand, she killed the plant with poisen implies that the gardener didn't intend to kill it and it was accidental. This suggests a lack of care and responsibility, which isn't related to the gardener being successful in gardening, as they are the opposite of success.\n7.

{"text": "was done watering what does it do? Choices: \nA: Turn brown\nB: Stay dark \nC: Stay pale \nD: Says thank you\nE: Turn green\nRationales:  1. First understand the correct meaning of \"green thumb.\" A green thumb is someone who has a talent for gardening and landscaping, especially growing plants using organic methods at a successful rate. \n2. Next, try to decipher each of the options.\n3. Starting from A: Turn brown. This does not make sense in the context of gardening. The phrase \"thought she was done watering\" suggests that the person would generally water the plant regularly, and therefore it wouldn't suddenly turn brown.\n4. B: Stay dark cannot be the correct answer as it defies logic.\n5. C: remain pale makes no sense in this sentence.\n6. D: Say thank you could be a possible answer as this could be a sign that the plant thanks the person for taking care of it, but saying thank you doesn't fit the context of the question.\n7. E: Turn green is the correct answer because it fits both the context of the question and the meaning of \"green thumb\".\n8. Therefore, if someone does not have a green thumb, it's likely that every time they water their plants, they're expecting them to turn green, but this doesn't actually happen.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: The store's manager didn't understand the customer's comment, how is this possible?

The correct answer will be the specific scenario depicted in the question.\n2. The correct answer is not a general description of the scenario.\n3. The question does a good job of indicating the intended solution, starting with the phrase \"She sure didn't have.\" At this point, we should look for a negative answer, especially because this implies something did not work out as planned.\n4. The second phrase \"When she thought she was plant\" provides some crucial information. It indicates that a person actually attempted to plant something, but it didn't turn out as expected or intended, probably in some way related to the outcome.\n5. Now that we know the intention of the phrase \"Every time she thought she was...\", our attention turns to the next phrase... \n6. \"What did she end up with?\" In this case, the only thing that could work as intended is the phrase \"tomato\", and if she thought she planted tomatoes, but she ended up with \"pepper\", she probably didn't have a \"green thumb.\"\nAnswer: Pepper\n\nInput: Which of these is the most common type of bread?

A: brown thumb. A brown thumb is often interpreted as a sign of bad luck in gardening. It implies that the person would have bad luck with their garden, implying that every time the woman tried to garden, she would fail.\n2. B: water. Water is required for any plants to grow.

The answer should be something related to negative experiences or emotions.\nEach option represents a different possibility for the type of emotion or experience the woman might have encountered.\nA: \"she became a farmer\" is not a probable answer, as the woman was most likely unsuccessful in tending to her plant.\nB: \"she planted on the wrong plant\" is also unlikely, as the phrase \"she thought she had\" in the question suggests a misunderstanding or misjudgement. This option implies that she knew exactly what she was doing and did indeed plant on the wrong plant, which is not the case. \nC: \"she planted a plant\" fits the context, as the experience of killing plants could be related to a mistake or misjudgement on her part. This option is more probable.\nD: \"she plant\" is similar to the correct option, \"she planted a plan,\" but is grammatically incorrect.\nE: \"she was sad\" is an emotion that is likely to be experienced by people who fail at things, but this does not align with the question, as it asks about the woman's experience and not her emotions. \nTherefore, the best option is a B: she planted the wrong plant.\nAnswer: B- she planted the wrong plan\n\nInput: In the manga it is revealed that Yuri and Victor were part of what?

Correct: How are plants benefical, they benefit animals and humans. Choices: Choice D: Cause of asthma. Choice E: Cause of skin blemishes. Choice F: Cause of headaches. Choice G: Cause of rashes. Choice H: They don't benefit anything.\nRationales:\nStep 1: Read the question and try to understand what the question asks.  \nStep 2: Try to figure out what the actual meaning of the question is and answer it.  \nStep 3: Understand what information you already have. If there are answer choices, you have to think about what answers it might include and eliminate ones that may not be possible options.  \nStep 4: Start to narrow down your list of options. In this case, you can eliminate two of the answer choices: G, they don't benefit anything and H, cause of rashes. You can do this in many ways. For example, by trying to figure out the words that describe benefits or the ones that negate benefits.  \nStep 5: Narrow your list down to two choices. You can make a list with possible answer choices and eliminate the ones that you consider improbable to be the correct answer.  \nStep 6: Identify the answer. Think about what information you have about the question and the answer choices. You can identify the one that makes the most sense and seems to be the correct answer to you.  \nStep 7: Select the response that is correct. In this case, the correct answer is C: Benefit animals and humans.\nAnswer: A. C - Benefit animals", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "would do great at gardening they had a problem. Choices:  A. watering B. wearing gloves C. spraying D. adding fertilizer E. spending  time\nRationales: The first step is to thoroughly understand what the question is addressing. In this case, it's a person's experience with gardening. Every time they tried to do well, they had a problem. \nSecond, we need to evaluate each of the answer choices one by one to pick the one that is most likely to cause a problem. We evaluate each choice based on the context provided as well as relevant factors. \nA. Watering - Wearing gloves helps prevent you from injuring yourself while gardening, but it's unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall success of gardening. \nB. Wearing gloves. While wearing gloves is necessary for some tasks such as pruning and digging, it's not likely to be a cause of problems when gardening.\nC. Spraying. Spraying pesticides or other chemicals is potentially harmful, so it could be a cause of problems for some individuals.\nD. Adding fertilizer. Adding fertilizer could be a cause of some issues if used incorrectly, but it's mostly used to improve plant health and growth.\nE. Spending time. Some people may find it challenging to dedicate enough time needed to maintain a garden, which could lead to problems. \nBased on the information provided and our evaluation of the answer choices, option D: fertilizing is most likely to be a cause for problems  in gardening. \nAside Fertilizing, which answer choice gives the best explanation of how the person did well at gardening 75 % of the time?

Choices:  A. she killed them with kindness B. she didn't know what the name of his was C. she neglected them D. she killed them without intention E. she killed them on accident\nRationales: First, clarify the confusion over the phrase 'with kindness'. This means giving her garden too much water instead of not giving it enough. \nConsidering each option, \nA. If she murdered them with 'kindness' then she murdered them on accident which is contradictive. \nB. If she doesn't know what her garden is called then she didn't know who they were trying to help and would've murdered them by accident or intention. \nC. By 'neglecting them' she wouldn't be giving them the 'kindness' and would've murder them on accident or intention. 5. Therefore, the only option that doesn't contradict herself is choice D:  She murdered them with intention.\nAnswer: D. She murdered them with intentions\n\nInput: Which is NOT a way to describe how to write an email. Choices:  B. use 3-4 lines of text. C. Include your name. D. Use paragraphs. E.

Next, we can eliminate the options that do not match the definition of an email and are not ways to write an email. \n2. We can eliminate option B: Use 3-4 lines and option C: Include your name. These options do not fit the description of an email. If you are writing an email, you will include your name within the email itself, or use the \"from\" field to address the email to a recipient before clicking \"send.\" \n3. Option D: Use paragraphs does not fit in the description of an email since paragraphs are something used in a written document; an email can also be used in multiple messages, so it does not necessarily have to follow the structure of a paragraphed document.\n4. Option E: Use a signature does not describe how to write an individual email, but rather how to write an email in bulk, such as when creating a template", "answer": " 300"}
{"text": "was on the right track with her garden, she was just off on the wrong one. Choices:  A. the wrong plan B. the wrong side C. the wrong shovel D. the wrong color E. the wrong answer\nRationales: First step is to understand the phrase \"thought she was on the right [track] with her garden.\" It's trying to say that one thought they were on the correct path to achieving a gardening outcome but was actually incorrect.\n2. Next step is to eliminate options that don't fit the situation. \n3. Choice A: wrong plan indicates that there is already a plan, hence already on the right track. This isn't an explanation of someone who is confused about what plan to pursue.\n4. Choice B: wrong side suggests the incorrect path has already been taken but is not the case, and there is no way they are confused about where they are. \n5. Choice C: wrong shovel suggests that there is not yet a plan for a gardening path and that the shovel was already used to start the process without any specific intention. This choice is not useful as it is not related to the situation.\n6. Choices D and E can both be taken as correct answers. Choice D is \"the wrong answer\" and Choice E is \"the wrong color.\" Both options are appropriate, depending on the goal.\n7. In summary, choices D and E are both correct possible answers, as \"the wrong answer\" can imply the wrong path forward or the wrong start, while \"the wrong color\" can imply the wrong choice of plants, which might also be a good path to take.\n8. Therefore the two best choices here are D: \"the wrong answer\" or E: \"the wrong color,\" as both are equally valid answers in this context.\n9. Therefore both the correct answer options D: \"the wrong color\" and E: \"the wrong answer.\"\nAnswer: D: the wrong answer and E: the wrong color\n\nInput: What do you call a person of the earth?

{"text": "put the plant in dirt it was already in water. Choices:  A-bath B-cereal C-soil D-furniture E-church\nRationales: First, it is important to understand and interpret the question correctly. The question asks about the action performed by \"every time she thought she put plant in dirt...\" There are two interpretations here:\n1. It happened every time she intended to do something, but instead, it ended up being something else. \n2. Every time she performed the intended action, the result was something else, without her realizing it. In other words, she couldn't tell what was going on.\n3. For the first interpretation, it doesn't matter what action was performed, as the result remains the same, the one that corresponds with choice D: furniture, as the result is \"it was already in water\".\n4. For the second interpretation, the intended actions are important as they were intended to result in something else. \n5. The action for choice B: cereal is irrelevant, as the desired end result remains the same, which eliminates this choice.\n6. The action for choice C: soil is irrelevant too, as the action is not meaningful when translated into the right end result, which is water. This leaves us with two options: \n7. E: Church and D: furniture. We eliminate the choice E: Church because \"every time...\" means that the result is not meaningful when it's obtained, i.e. the end result is already another thing. Moreover, it is irrelevant if a church is being built or planted in water, so this solution is not possible.\n8.

{"text": "could grow plants, she did what to them? Choices:  Tuesdays: A: Kill B: feed C: water D: spray E: weed\nRationales: The first step is to interpret the question and the answer choices. \nStep 1: The phrases \"every time\" and \"she thought\" indicate that she's trying multiple times to grow plants.\nStep 2: \"Thinking\" (or \"thoughts\") are about mental processes, which are not applicable in this context. There is no evidence that suggests she uses her thoughts in her attempt to grow plants.\n3. Step 5: This indicates she is consistently trying but is unsuccessful. \nStep 6: There is nothing about her personality or thinking style that would be related to plant growth. It can be inferred that she's not particularly successful at plant growth, but this isn't enough to establish the \"personality\" relation. \nStep 7: Plants are \"easy to grow\" only in terms of how quickly they can recover. They require specific, repetitive care and can be difficult to keep alive. This makes \"Kill\" an unlikely answer because it suggests she is using extreme measures in her attempts to grow plants.\n4. Step 8: Feed, water, weed, and spray are all relevant actions needed to grow plants: feeding gives the plants nutrients while watering quenches their thirst; weeding removes unwanted materials from the soil; spraying is a common method of pest control. They are all actions that indicate her attempt to grow plants, which aligns with her \"trying to grow plants\" intention. Therefore, the best answers are B: feed and D: water.\nStep 9. We can eliminate feed as the correct answer because it is not sufficient to grow plants. Plants are primarily water-based, requiring water to grow. \nStep 9. The next step is deciding which of the two answer choices is more likely to be the correct answer. Water can be used in conjunction with feed, and is more critical to growing plants. Therefore, the best possible answer is D: water\nAnswer: D: water\n\nInput: Which one of these is more likely to be good to work at?

{"text": "was helping the plant it died. Choices: A: watering B: weeding C: pulling out D: planting  E: moving\nRationales: Start with step 1: Identify the question and its scope. In this case, the question asks whether someone has a green thumb. A 'green thumb' is someone who has a natural talent and ability for gardening, landscaping, or horticulture. \nStep 2. Break down the details \nStep 3. Identify the best answer\n\nStep 1. The key phrases that indicate a green thumb are someone's \"helping\" or \"helping the plant.\" This implies that they must have done something beneficial to the plant for it to grow and flourish. \nStep 1. Consider each of the options and the supporting details they provide. Each option has details that can indicate good and bad aspects of their green thumb.\nStep 1. Watering could have either a positive or negative effect on a plant's growth and health, depending on whether it is done correctly. \nStep 5. Pulling out could hurt the plant, either physically removing a healthy section of the plant or damaging it due to the force involved.\nStep 5. Planting could enhance or benefit the plant if done correctly, as a healthy plant needs proper soil and a suitable growing environment.\nStep 5: Weeding could help the plant by removing competing or unwanted plants that could otherwise harm or rob the plant of nutrients.\nStep 5, Moving could be a neutral action as, depending on the plant's new location, it could receive more or less sunlight, water, and other environmental factors that could affect its health.\nStep 5 and 6.

Choices:  Growing light A: Growing soil B: Growing light C: Growing soil D: Growing light E: Growing soil\nRationales: The phrase \"She sure didn't have the green thumb,\" essentially means she was not proficient or skilled in gardening or growing plants. \nStep 1: Read the answer choices: 1. Growing light 2. Growing soil 3. Growing light... 4.... Growing soil. \nStep 2. Decide which answer choices fit the criteria of the question. \nStep 8. We can eliminate options B and E (these are related to Growing light) and D and F (These are related to Gowing soil). So, we have the options: A, C, and B.\nStep 9. We want to take note of the other details in the sentence to help guide us in choosing the best answer. \nStep 5. Read the question again. The key phrase here is \"... did to herself\". This means that we need to look for an action that a person can perform himself or herself in order to be successful at gardening or growing plants, which is the question's aim.\nStep 6. Consider the choices:\nStep 8. Since we need an action that a person could perform on his own, we eliminate the option \"Growing light\" since that is something that needs to be done outside.

Choices:  A. die B. fail C. grow D. never E. thrive\nRationales: First, it's useful to understand the phrase \"she sure didn't have\" and what it implies in this context. \"sure didn't have\" indicates that \"not having\" is a consistent pattern in this person's experience. Hence, we are looking for a choice that fits with the concept of \"not having.\" \nNext, let's consider each option:  \n1. A. die. This option describes a final state and may not fit the need since the focus is on whether the person had a green thumb. \n2. B. fail. This option describes an outcome that may not be what the person intended or expected, and so it's not an appropriate choice.\n3. C. grow. This option is not what the person doesn't have and so isn't a good answer choice.\n4. D. never. This is the opposite of what the person lacks, so it also doesn't fit. \n5. E: Thrive. This option fits the definition of \"not having a green thumb,\" as it means a plant will thrive with proper care and attention. The contrast here is that this option describes the ideal outcome, not what the person lacks. Hence, this is the intended meaning of the phrase \"sure didn' t have a green thumb.\"\nAnswer: E: thrive\n\nInput: An apple doesn't have what?

{"text": "would kill a plant it died. Choices:  A. water it too much B. fertilized it with too much chemicals C. overwater it D. put too much fertilizer on it E. planted it in a different location\nRationales: The solution to the problem of the plant dying is to try a different approach, rather than to keep doing the same things over and over again. This suggests that the answer lies in doing something different, rather than staying in one place.\n1. The answer \"A. water it too much\" does not answer the underlying problem, which was that the plant died when it was tended to. Watering a plant too much is not necessarily a bad thing, and it doesn't solve the underlying problem of the plant's death.\n\nInput: What do people take a break? Choices: 1: work 2: time with family and friends 3: go outside 4: nap 5: do chores around the house\nRationales: In this problem, breaking a single word is a useful way to generate potential answers. For instance, the word \"break\" can be divided into different parts that may result in different meaning and different possible answers.\n1. \"Time with family and friends\" refers to social interaction, which can involve time with family and friends. Therefore, this is a valid answer.\n2. \"Nap\" means taking a break from work or activities, and \"do chores\" involves taking care of different tasks, so these words make this an appropriate answer.\n3. \"Go outside\" could mean taking a walk or engaging in other outdoor activities such as gardening or sports. This is a valid answer. \n4. \"Do chores\" includes tasks such as washing the car or laundry. This is a valid choice. \n5. \"Time with family\" and \"time with friends\" refer to social interactions and social activities, so these make valid answers.\n\nAnswer: 2: time with friends and family\n\n### Explanation:\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes an event.

Choices:  a. twin b. quad c. triplet d. singleton e. orphan\nRationales: \"A woman who has two sisters is a what?\" - Here, the first question that comes to mind is whether the woman herself is a sister or someone's sister. If she is a sister, then the answer \"sister\" is obvious. \nAs we are all born into families with siblings, almost every woman is assumed to be a sister. \nHence, the question can reasonably be rephrased as : If the woman does not have any siblings, what would she be then? \nHopefully, a reader would have already made the connection with being an orphan. \nIf so, the right answer should be \"Orphan\". However, the answer should be \"Orphans\". One should always pick the answer where there is no alternative. In other words, a woman who has 2 sisters and no brother would be an orphan.\nRather than twins or triplets (which require having more than one sibling), or a single (who doesn't have a sibling), the only option left should be orphans. \n\nInput: An orange orange is a what?

It's about the choices a person made to compensate for the failure to help their plant grow. \nChoices: 1. Remove the plant: although this can be a response to plant failure, it's not the appropriate solution in the context of this story.

Overwater it: this is a possible alternative reaction and would match the given phrase about a positive response to failure.\n3. Over-fertilize it: similarly, this may be a solution that one could implement in other circumstances to address the issue of plant failure, and that is why it's also part of the options. \n4. Water it for too long: this may also be a useful solution if one finds that the roots of the plant are too congested or suffocated. However, in this context, it does not clearly indicate a positive response to plant failure, so it's not the correct choice.\n5.

{"text": "grew a flower she would get what? Choices: 1. a headache 2. an orange flower 3. a yellow thumb 4. black thumb 5. a blue flower 6. a red thumb 7. a white flower\nRationales: The question poses two clues: \"every time she thought she grew (a) flower.\" And \"got (a) thumb.\" We start by identifying each sentence and its respective words. \n1. A flower: The word 'a' indicates the sentence is referring to a singular word or event. \n2. A thumb: The term 'a' in this sentence refers to a plural word or event. 3. She sure didn't... 4. every time she thought she... 5. headache 6. black thumb 7. a blue flower \nFrom the above information and the context of the question, it is evident that the first sentence refers to a singular event while the second sentence refers to a plurality of events. We can conclude that \"a flower\" is the singular object being referred to in the first sentence while \"a thumb\" is the plural object being referred to in this sentence.\nIt is also evident that the second sentence is negative, i.e. \"She sure didn't have...\" And hence, we know that every time she thought she had grown a flower, she didn't.\nThis information tells us that she thought she grew a single, singular flower, and not many or multiple flowers. Since the first sentence refers to the singular object being a 'flower' and the second sentence refers to the plural object being a 'thumb'; and since she thought she grew only a single/singular flower, it is safe to assume that the plural term the second sentence refers to-'a thumb' - can be replaced by any singular object, including a thumb.\n\n### What is the reason the person has 100% chance to not pass the class?\n\nInput: Why did the student not pass the class?

{"text": "watered plant, it withered away. Choices:  A. Wrong  B. Sad C. Happy  D. Happy E. Wrong\nRationales: The first step is to comprehend the question. The phrase: \"She sure didn't have green thumb\" means she was bad at \"gardening\", or growing plants.\nEach choice represents what emotion one could respond with in this situation.\n\n1. Wrong is not a logical choice as it does not fit the phrase, \"She sure didn' think it.\" It is too vague and unspecific.\n2. Sad can be a response if the person felt bad about her plant dying. However, the phrase: \"Every time she thought she watering the plant...\" implies she may not be aware of the cause of death or believe it's her carelessness. Thus, this choice is unlikely.\n3. Happy is not an emotional response as it makes no sense in this situation. If someone thinks their plant is dying, they are unlikely to respond with happiness.\n4. Happy E: Wrong is not an emotion and does not fit the phrase \"She sure didn' have a green thumb.\"\n5. The remaining choices are all emotion related and therefore applicable.\n6. Although C: Sad might seem like the best answer, we need to consider all of the options. \"Happy\" is more likely to be interpreted as a response to the death of the plant, rather than sadness over the death.\nTherefore, the best answer is B: \"She sure didn 't have a green thumb.\" It is the response to the death of a plant.\nAnswer: B. \"She sure didn't have a green thumb.\" This is the logical conclusion that the person is good at gardening.

Therefore, this choice is a bad match.\n2. \"Pessimist\" is not something that indicates inability to care for plants or have a successful garden. Pessimism could lead to poor results in some cases, but it's ultimately not indicative of not caring. \n3. \"Perfectionist\" is not something associated with gardening or plants.\n4. \"Negligent\" is a possible answer, in that you can be negligent by not paying attention to your garden and your plants. However, this isn't an indication of being incapable of caring, which is what we're looking at.\n5. This leaves us with option D: \"inability to care\". This fits the description of an indication of a trait not good at having a successful plant or garden.\nAnswer: D", "answer": " 15"}

Choices:  G: a black thumb B: a magenta thumb D: a brown thumb E: a white thumb\nRationales: Here the question is asking us who the speaker is talking about and what they received by showing an \"improvement\" in plant growth.\n1. \"She sure didn't have...a green thumb\" implies this person has a black thumb, but this could also be a brown thumb, so we eliminate B.\n2. \"She sure didn\u2019t have...a magenta thumb\" is an unlikely color for a thumb and also unlikely to represent overall improvement, so this is excluded.\n3. \"She sure didn\"t have...a brown thumb\" would be a reasonable answer, as the implication of brown being a common color could indicate \"average\" which would be considered an improvement from \"black\" or \"magenta.\" However, a common color does not necessarily represent improvement.\n4. Now that we've eliminated most of the choices, we can focus on the remaining choices. We want to determine the most likely answer with the best fit to the given narrative.\n5. \"She sure didn\u2026have a white thumb\" makes the most sense considering the phrasing \u201cevery time she thought she was _____, she got a ______,\u201d and the fact that \u201cthought\u201d implies a guess or prediction.

A carnivore is an animal that eats flesh and meat. Now consider each of the other remaining options one at a time.\n4. A car is an automobile, which is a type of animal.

We want to determine what the woman in the sentence is referring to as her green thumb. We must identify what her handicap is, as well as what her ability is. \n2. We eliminate the incorrect choices from A to E based on our knowledge of what a green thumb is:\n3. A: pizza. This doesn't have anything to do with the woman's abilities or handicaps. \n4. B: flower pot. No, a flower pot isn't a green thumb. \n5. C: lawnmower, D: shovel, E: sink. These aren't references to planting either, so they can be eliminated as well. \n6. Now we consider choice F: garden. This is a perfect metaphor for a woman's handicap because it's clearly different in nature than her ability. Therefore, the answer choice is garden, the definition of green thumb does not match the woman's handicapped ability.\n7. The sentence also implies that her handicap is not sufficient enough to produce the same results, which makes the metaphorical definition of green thumb even more appropriate and acceptable. \n8.

This question asks about an unsuccessful gardener whose attempts at starting a garden always failed.\nThe question is asking if every time she thought she\u2019d have a garden in her home, she ended up with a certain thing.\nThe first thing to do is identify the options she\u2019s given. We start eliminating the options.\nOption A: flower. The phrase \u201cany thought of a garden\u201d shows that she wasn\u2019t even trying to grow flowers. Option B: vegetable.

The phrase \u2018thought she\u2019d have a\u2019 indicates that she would want to grow a tree, not a fruit-bearing tree. Option D: bird. This option is clearly not something that\u2019s grown in a garden; a bird is a living creature, not an item. Option E: fruit or pot.

Second, we relate the given facts to the specific context of this question, in which someone believes they killed every plant they put outside. \nAfter assessing each of the answer choices, our conclusion is as follows: \nA. Inferior plant material is not a plausible answer choice, as it doesn't represent the underlying cause of the person's inability to keep plants alive. \nB. Didn't pay enough attention is not the answer, as it's not the only reason plants can die, and the sentence makes it clear that the person is not the only one who thought she had a good plan for keeping plants alive. \nC. Wrong soil is a possible explanation for why the plants died. This is because the soil may not have been suitable for the type of plant the person chose. However, this can be ruled out as not the only explanation, since the person may have killed the plant simply out of neglect. \nD. Wrong light could have been a problem, if the plants were exposed to too much sunlight or shade. However, this can also be ruled out, as the person failed to keep every plant alive. \nE. Wrong water was the most likely reason for the plants dying, since the person can't even keep a single plant alive.

{"text": "was growing flowers she would make what? Choices: 1: a tree 2: a bush 3: a lot of plants 4: dirt 5: a lawn 6: a field\nRationales: First, understand the question by isolating and defining the phrase 'plant' and 'green thumb'. The question asks us to pick the phrase that doesn't fit with 'green thumb'. 'Green thumb' means having a successful garden or skill of growing things.\n7. Let's now check the choices.\n8. Choices one (a tree) and three (a lot of plants) do not involve growing plants or success in gardening. They are completely unrelated to 'green thumb' and therefore could be eliminated.\n9. Choice three implies the absence of plant, yet the question already states that the person didn't have a 'green thumb'. Therefore, it also could not be the given phrase.\n10. 'dirt' (choice four) does not fit the requirements of the question. Plants are not grown from dirt, yet alone 'green thumb', they need to be in soil of good quality for growing.\n11. From the other three choices: choice two (a bush), 'bush' can either be a type of plant or a type of tree. Tree (choice one) and plants (choice three) are not related to gardening, while bush (choice two) is.

D: She was using too much sunlight.  E: There was a bug problem.\nRationales: First, let's break down the question. \"She sure didn't have\" indicates that someone was doing something wrong. \"Every time she thought she was\" indicates that someone had good intentions but still made the same mistake. \"The plants would wilt and then die\" indicates that something was causing plants to die.  Now, let\u2019s dissect each option to find out which choice is right.  An: She was overwatering the plants.  Overwatering plants is a common cause of plant deaths.  Therefore, this option is plausible.  B: She needs fertilizer.  Fertilizer provides the nutrients that plants need to grow and thrive. It can help prevent plant death, but it can also cause an excess of nutrients if not used correctly.  So, this option could be correct.  C: She forget to water the plants.  Water is essential for plant health. If the plants are not getting enough water, it can cause the leaves to wilt and eventually the plants to die. This choice could be the answer.  D: She used too much sunlight. If a plant receives too much sunlight, it can cause the plants to produce excessive amounts of energy, which can then be toxic to the plants.  This choice could be correct.  E: There is a bug problem. Some plant problems, such as whiteflies, can lead to a significant decrease in the plant's health. So, E is the correct option.

Choices:  S: Purchase plant food and water it outside  A: Water the garden to the right of the plant B: Move the plant to a sunny spot C: Dig up the plant and re-plant it in the proper depth D: Add potassium to the soil after re-planting\nRationales: First, consider the question carefully. The sentence gives a few clues. One of them is that the person thought about watering the plant, and when they did, they actually watered their toes instead. \nSecond, look at each of the possible answer choices and see which best fits the person's situation.\n3. Plant food (Choice S) might help with watering a plant and maintaining its health, but wouldn't solve the problem of accidentally watering one's toes.\n4. Moving the plant to a sunnier spot (Choice B) sounds like a solution which will allow the plant to grow healthily, but it's unclear if this would also resolve the issue of \"accidentally watering (one's) toes\".\n5. Digging up the plant and replanting it deeper (Choice D) is an answer that may sound logical, but it wouldn't directly fix the problem of accidentally spraying water on toes, as this would still require the person to water the plant.\n6. Finally, we have a remaining answer choice: Potassium to the Soil (Choice A). This stands out as the most logical answer because it suggests the problem of accidentally waters toes may be caused by the water not having enough potassium in it, which would make the toes wet. Potassium can help to keep the leaves on the plant green and the soil healthy, it would also mean that the water used to water the plant has the right ratio of nutrients inside. Therefore, it makes sense that the person could solve the problem by adding potassium to the already wet earth they had already used to water the plant. This is one of the most likely answer choices out of the available options. \n7. Therefore, we conclude that the answer is A: Potassium to soil.\n8. There is a high chance that accidentally watering toes is caused by the water being too wet. Adding potassium can", "answer": " 567"}

We see that she was trying to grow plants, but that she had difficulties, as her plants kept dying. \nNext, we consider each option. Aphids (option A) can actually be the cause of plants withering, but aphids can indicate a more general set of issues - specifically, insects - which is not the situation in this case. \nWeeding (option B) can cause unfortunate results such as death if it is not done correctly (which the narrative seems to imply), but this would not address the issue of a bad \"green thumb\" which was the key point of the narrative. \nAdditionally, \"too much\" or \"too little\" water would not necessarily be related to her thumb as that is the root of the question. \nFinally, the plants died due to lack of sun, \"too little sunlight\" (option E) does not address the problem of her hand at all, and therefore does not solve the problem of the narrative. This eliminates E. \nFinally to pick the correct answer, we have to consider that this is not a general problem with plants but a very specific set of problems within a singular context - that of her own. \"Not enough sun\" does not mean anything as far as context is concerned or that the narrative implies.

A Green thumb is a person who can grow their plant. It can also mean a person who possesses the skills and talent to grow and nurture healthy plants, while sink is \"to place a thing deeply beneath the surface of an abyss (water) or the sea bottom\". So, sink the plants which has \"put the plants deeply beneath\" is not the same as what the question ask.\nB. A green thumb can mean a person who posses the skills and talent to take care of green plants. Over and under are mean to use excess of water. Therefore, we cross off A and B.\nC. The literal meaning of green is \"consisting of or having a green color\"; a green thumb is someone with an excellent aptitude for growing plants. The literal meaning of excess or more than is \"more than is needed or allowed\". More than is allowed in watering the plants, which is not the same as the question.\nD.

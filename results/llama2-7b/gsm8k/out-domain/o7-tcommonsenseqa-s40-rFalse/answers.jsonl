D. is more expensive.  E. matches a dress.\nOutput: B\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below\n\nI. What are the steps to solving this problem?\n\n## SOLUTION:\n\nWe need to identify the key variables, which are the letters in the word.\n1. We can use the number of occurrences of these letters in the given words.\n```java\nPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"\\\\b[a-z]{1,4}\\\\b\");\nMatcher matcher = pattern.matcher(\"happy\").reset();\nint[] letters = new int[matcher.findCount()];\nfor(int k=0;k<letters.length;k++){\n    letters[k] = matcher.groupCounts()[k];\n}\n```\n2. We can also use the frequency as given by DFSA\nFor example, a is 4, b is 3, c is 1, d is 3 etc. We could have used \"4 3 1 3\" as the key variable but we have used string form for convenience.\n\n3. The key variables are now the answers to the question. Use map as the storehouse of the key variables. This is the reason why I need to check for string, so that I can store it in Map (instead of number).\n```java\nMap<String, Integer> key = new HashMap<>();\nfor(int i=0; i<100; i++){\n    String letter = (String)key.put(\"a\"+(i%4), \"a+1\");\n}\n```\n\n4. Now, we can find the occurrence of a variable in a given sentence using the variable.\n```java", "answer": " 42"}

Choices: A: happy B: sad C: tired D: content E: grumpy\nOutput: A: happy\n\n### My Solution:\n\nTo do this, I have to think like a test grader. I need to know how will I grade these questions. When you have a bunch of choices, you need to determine what will make it hard or easy to decide which one is correct vs. incorrect. \nSome questions are fairly straight forward. For example, someone writes down `John gave a perfunctury examination of the corpe` so the obvious typo would stand out for me to highlight it.\nAnother example: `He wouldn't have if it he had been more thoughtful.`. The extra letter would stand out for me in this example. So that's part one of this, highlighting the typo/obvious.\nI then wanted to add another way to find answers. I used regular expressions to check for some of the answers that I knew would happen. For example, John was thorough, so I could check for that. If I had `John was completed`, it won't let me continue on to the next questions. Or else, you won't ever complete it.\n\nI got lucky with the math question. I had to go through the book to find the one I was looking for. I thought of having the program generate numbers to be used in each question, but it's not an awesome idea. It does happen on occasion with the other questions, but it's very unlikely.", "answer": " 5"}

Choices: A: barring B: graphing C: line graphs D: charts E: pictographs\nOutput: C: line graphs\n\nInput: I\u2019m trying to create a bar graph that can be printed. How do I create a bar graph for these data? Choices: A. The class should have a lot of input about this question. The data should show that the class is very divided on the type of bar graph to use. Choices will range from horizontal to vertical. There is no consensus among the class, as to which type is best. Because no graph may be accepted, it\u2019s best to use a combination of horizontal and vertical bar graphs and provide information as to why the student came up with the combination that they did. Be sure to tell the teacher that you will do that. You will need to create some kind of graph that can be printed so tell me now. It will probably be best to create both a pictorial graph or picture of the graph and the written description. You should not simply paste the raw data into a graph.  B. When I looked at the class\u2019s data, I noticed that a lot of it is missing. I also noticed that there are lots of duplications. I decided to combine the missing entries and some of the duplications making the number of values 63. I\u2019ll show you how it is done. C. The class decided that it would be easier to use a combination of types of bar graphs. I will explain how the graphs were set up and show you some of the reasoning behind the choices that I made. I will be showing the graph and some of my reasoning in a couple of days.\nOutput:(C) When I looked at the data I saw many different types of data being reported by different students in the class. Most of the data could be reported in some type of graph.  My graph shows more than 13 distinct types of data being reported. Many of the students who reported data, used different descriptions for their measurements. I decided to look at each measurement and find what type it was before I constructed the graph. When I constructed my graph I did not have the numbers, I only had descriptions. I did have the actual data reported by other students in the class, however, because I did not have", "answer": " 100"}

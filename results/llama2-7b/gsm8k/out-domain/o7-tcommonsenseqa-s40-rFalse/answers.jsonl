She shaved off 72 books because of the top section of the work cart (8 romance books x 2, 10 poetry books x 1, 4 poetry books from 1, 12 history books x 1). 10 is the amount of mystery books left in her, Nancy shaved off 10 mystery books by putting them back where they belong. At the top section again, Nancy shaved the bottom half again that means 5 romance books, 5 poetry books, and 1 history books remained. 1,5,1 is the amount of Western novels and biographies she had and Nancy shaved off half because of the way she put the Western novels, so 1 and 6 biography novels remain.  We can write it like this: 12 books = 30 books - (8 romance books X 2) - (10 mystery books left in the cart) - (12 history books left in cart) * 1; 8 books = 30 - (10 mystery novels left in cart * 2) - (8 poetry left in the cart x 1) + (12 history left in the cart) + (1,5,1).

{"text": "Mark's two pets run at 10 feet/sec and crawl at 1 foot per-sec. First, we need to find the duration of the 20 foot race. To find the duration we need our average speed, (which is the speed of the slower of the two pets, (1*20)/2) as well as our starting time. We know that the turtle is behind the hare, so we can use the time equation of: \"Time for a runner = Distance/Speed\". We know that the hare takes 20 seconds to travel 20 feet, So we get an answer of: \"Distance of the slowest pet over the course duration\" times speed of both pets is 20 feet for the hare and 1 foot over the course duration for the turtle with an average speed of 10 feet per second. Let's plug it in. The slowest pet, (the turtle) runs for 20 feet, which takes (1*20)-0.2 seconds to finish. Since we want the turtle to finish in a tie, this means the turtle must run 0.2 seconds after the hare so the turtle runs for 20.2 seconds. We can substitute the times into the equation (10(20.2)-0.2)/2 which makes 5.1 seconds. Therefore, the turtle has to open a 5.1 second head start on the hare.", "answer": " 18"}

A percent increase/decrease is the change in a number expressed as a percentage. What this means is that you start with 81 and determine what percent decrease this is, in other words how much do we need to knock off this number. The answer is 10% because we need to take of 8.1.

{"text": "I think that she should pick all of the strawberries she can.\n\n### Explanation for why the response is correct or incorrect, (optional):\n\n1. She can pick 3 baskets because that is the 3 baskets that her brother picked.  \n2. She is one-fourth of the 8, but not one-sixth of the 8.  \n3. If you divide 121 by 3 it is 41 plus 1, so 42, so then you can divide all numbers by 42 and get your answer. For instance, 5 divided by 42 is 0.120476190.  \n4. 121 minus 41, and then there is 80 and then divide 80 by 42 to get 1.8571486.  \n5. 1.85 divided by three is 0.6166982. You add the 0.39 to get a total. In this case it's 61, so multiply all the rest numbers by 61, such as 5 would be 30, but would have to be 31 because of the remainder, and then 42 would be 2561.   \n6. 2561 divided by 42 would be about 60.25.\n\n### Hints:\n\nThe hints explain what to do if you find a word or two you don't understand. The hints are also designed to get you to do more research so that you may be able to answer the question on your own after seeing them.\n\nHint1:There are 8 people, so that mean that each person can pick 15 strawberrys and they can get 121 strawberries but 41 less?

{"text": "She gives away $1680\n\n### Input:$5,000 divided by $30,000 gives what?\n\n### Democracy\nDemocratic government is government where the power to make laws and run the country rests with the people, not people who are in control. It is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Thomas Jefferson first used this phrase about government in his 1825 message to Congress. He was talking about government by the people, but the words sound so good that they might as well have been about democracy itself. The American system of government makes democracy work. In the American system, it is up to the people to decide who is going to make law and who is going to run the country, not just a king or a dictator who decides these things for them.\n\nDemocratic governments can do a lot of things better than non-democratic governments can, and so democracy is better. In fact, it is not just better democratic governments but democracy itself, which is better than any other kind of government. When people are able to choose their representatives, when the system is fair to all groups in society, when everybody's vote counts (not just the votes of people wealthy enough to be able to be elected), then people's voices are heard, and a country is able to make wise choices together.\n\nDemocracy can help the poor and ensure the rights of individuals. It can support innovation and good ideas, and the people can choose the best ideas for the country. A democracy can also offer protection from unwise decisions by leaders who are not able to represent all the people, if the people are given a voice. It also offers protection from the kinds of harsh social rules and controls that tend to be part of governments where one person or a few people are in charge.\n\n\n### Freedom of Speech\n\nWhat is freedom of speech? In the United States, many other countries, and around the world, freedom of speech is a right that people have, because it belongs to them as human beings. This right is so important that it's sometimes given other names by country, like the right to expression. Freedom of speech is about people being able to say what they want without fear of punishment or persecution from people who might not like", "answer": " 480"}

{"text": "It was suggested by Tara that she wants to buy a laptop which cost $1000 dollars. The shop will require 20% downpayment to pay of the remaining 80%. The computer shop has asked Tara to pay for the computer for four months with the amount of $65 downpayment for each month, but only if she pays an extra 20$. With that information we can assume that each month will be $55. If an accumulative amount is paid off by the end of four months, $55 x 4, equal to 220$. This does not take into consideration the addition of 20 to be subtracted from the amount each payment. This will allow us to deduce the balance after four months. If we subtract the balance four months from the total payment of the computer, the difference is 200. This leaves a balance of $200.\n\n### Input and Response from the above challenge\n\nInput:A laptop costs  $1000, Tara's bank will give her a credit limit of  $4000 for her first 3 months, her card has a limit of  10% interest. The credit card has a minimum  monthly   payment of  $100, but will allow you to increase your minimum   monthly   payment for the next 3 months for   $35 per month.  If Tara pays  off her 4th   month's payment   on her credit card before  her 5th   monthly   payment is due, what is the most   Tara is   required to  pay to her bank to satisfy her balance?\n\nResponse:Tara wants to buy a laptop that will cost a thousand dollars. She is given a credit limit by her bank of $4000 which is able to be used within the first 3 months of her purchase. If she is able to exceed her credit limit which is $4000, she is subject to pay 10% interest. Her credit card allows for a minimum payment each month but also has a minimum rate of $100 per each month. If Tara pays off her 4th month's payment as a result of her 5th monthly payment, the total payments in which Tara would need to make monthly is $140.\n\n## Instructions:", "answer": " 520"}

How may ways can she divide them into 3 different piles?\n### Response: There are 3,4 or 6 ways to divide 10 coins into 3 different pile when we assume that Jane's pennies and other coins are identical. By looking at combinations and permutations we see that 3 can be divided into 3 groups with 1 penny in each group.  There are 6 unique combinations in which Jane can have exactly 3 pennies with the other coins being other coins.  Finally, there are 2 groups of 3 coins each in which Jane can have 3 pennies.  In this last case, either pile has zero or 1 pennies.  Altogether there are 12 ways to divide 13 coins into 4 different pile.\n\n### Input For the third response:There are 5 students in a group, each student gets a different number of stars assigned to a question.

With each student having 5 stars, there are 5 ways to assign them the stars,  When each student has 4 stars, there are 4 ways to assign them the 4 stars.  When each student has only 1 star, this star is unique,  thus there are 5 possible star assignments to the 5 students.   When each student has two stars, again, each student gets a 2 or a 4, thus there are 4 possibilities.  When each student gets three stars, there are 3 possibilities of giving 3 stars.  The last case occurs when each student only has one star and it is not enough to get it a second time.

Is it as simple as it seems, even if you can't actually talk to one? There are many ways to code. Do you prefer a quiet and lonely environment, or maybe you're the talkative type that loves to just talk to your code as you try to solve problems with your program. Well, what if, you could talk to your computer and make it talk back to you as you code and use it to solve problems? This is what Rubber Duck Programmers do! This video goes over Rubber Duck Programmer's, and I actually do explain why they're called rubber ducks! It is a lot to digest in one video, but I do touch on everything that I know and have heard about the concept!\n* [Coding Problems 1: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7372vwg_5k) \n* [How to Find a Solution](https://youto.be/r_D_v64EOa8)\n* [Coding problem: how to choose a strategy](https://youtub.be/Q-bNb8gwV88)\n* [E12-5,5 Problem solving](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalc1/pp/pp23-5)\n* [E20-27 Problem solving](https://youtoube.be/6RlcD2M9_mE)\n\n### Subscribe\n\nYou can subscribe to get all updates.\n\n> Subscribe to the Channel by [codingkublai](https://github.com/codingkubla), so that you won't miss the next Video!", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "$13.00\n\n### Instructions:Answer the questions in the following table.\n\n### Input Table:\n\n### Question1:What is a verb?\n\n### Answer:  Verb is that part of speech which in this sense,  describes what are called _doing words_: for example, go, eat, and sleep. Adverbs are those which describe verbs, _where_ verbs are done; adjectives describe the subject, or _who_ does.\n\n### Question2:Write four different types of adverbs.\n\n### Answer1: \nAdverbs: they give direction to the verb.\n\n### Example:\n\n### Example Sentence: John usually runs fast.\n\n### Adverbs in this sentence: _fast_ in 'fast running' tells us the direction of the verb,  and also tells us that 'John' is the subject, _usually_ gives direction to the verb and tells us an idea about john 'John is usually fast' is the adverb clause.\n\n### \n\n### Example2:\n\n###\tExample Sentence:John ran fast.\n\n## Adverbs\t-\n###\tExample3:\n\n###\nExample Sentence: He is not fast-running, but in the meantime, he is busy.\n\n## Example4:\n\n##Example Sentence: The ball is in such a way that it is hard to bounce.\n\n### Difference: -\tIn 3 sentence an adverb can be told by a change in the verb, in this case, 'ran' which is the verb.  In 2nd sentence the adverb is telling where's 'fast' and in the 4th sentence it is changing word in sentence which is ball.\n\n###\tQ1:What exactly is an auxiliary verb?\n\n##\tAnswer: Auxiliary Verbs are those verbs than can also help the main verb to be in correct tense.  'Doubing' verbs and 'being' verbs in 3rd person are those verbs.  They are very important in a sentence.\n\n###Example:\nI go to work everyday. \t\nI've had enough. \nTheir mother is busy now", "answer": " 8"}

However, 2% of the germs that die from one chemical are the same ones that die from the other chemical.\n\n### Response (Revised):6% of germs are alive after using both the sprays together.\n\n### Rationale (Revised):Soap and water only kill 100% of the germs.  The chemicals kill 60% and 6% of germs total.  Since 6% of the germs are left alive, so are 94% of the germs and so we only need to kill 6% of the 94%, or half the germs for the second chemical.\n\n## Challenge\n\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following grade math question\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Everyone thought John's father was a very good coach, but what happened when the team lost?

I recently read a biography of John Wilkes Booth, the president's assassin, and I never knew why he did what he did. In fact, I felt terribly bad for him. After reading this, I'm not sure I'd want to read another biography because many of them tend to be boring and tell us little about the person. Why do the authors of these biographies think that this material will be interesting to the general reader?

Some people just want to learn new things, it's understandable that there is no need to learn it in every biography.\n\n### Input \n\n> Q: We've just discovered that the planetary system around Alpha Centauri consists of three planets in close orbits very close to a small yellow star orbiting very close to the triple star Alpha Centauri.

I hope you don't expect me to do the math, but I can answer \"maybe a lot\", although I don't think any of them would be suitable for humans, since their sun is too small and too close to the triple star. There are probably a lot of them, and I'm pretty sure that they don't necessarily have to be as close to the sun as our planets. However, if your definition of Earth includes not just the surface of the Earth, but the entire solar system, then there aren't very many planets like that.\n\n###Input \n\n> The answer is very short and only takes one second.

The city advertised for a pitcher, offering a monthly salary plus 10 bonuses each month for wins. The city also had a policy on winning. If the pitcher won 7, 8, 9, or 10 games during the month, he got 10 additional bonuses. If the pitcher had 11 or 12 wins, he didn't get any additional bonuses, because the policy was to encourage the pitcher to win, not to win, win. The city expected the pitcher to win all 12 games during the first month of the season.  A month later, however, the pitcher had not won any games and had not received any bonuses. However, the bonus policy had caused the pitcher to work very much harder, if not harder overall than any other pitcher in the game, but for all of his effort, he had not been rewarded with winning any games. As a result, he was angry and decided to refuse future bonuses.

Some responses may be simpler than others, but it is important to focus on the concept that you are supposed to develop (i.e. not on a specific answer). Respond to the tasks by writing code that defines the appropriate set operators that must be used to solve the task.\n\n### Task 1:\n\nHow many apples are missing in the container after 1 apple was added?\n\n#### Answer\n\n1 is the missing number \nbecause 1+1 =2 and after 1 apple is added the 1 apple left in the container has been added and the number of apples is no longer 2\n\n### Tasks 2:\n\nI am sorry I don't understand.I will ask you for the code \n\n### Task\n\nHow many times does the number 3 occur in the sequence?\n\n#### Answer \n\nThe answer to this question is 3 because 3 occur 2 times in the first three number of the sequence that is 1 2 3 so 3 is what we got", "answer": " 2000"}
{"text": "101.25\n\n### Demostration:\nYou can use a table to find the answer.  If you have 60/24 = 2.5 people who like football and 250 / 50% = 52.5 people who play football, then\n52.5 * 2.5 = 126.25 people play football (not including the 25.81 people who like it but don't play it).  Since there are 60/250 = 24 people who like football,\n24 * 126.81 = 312 people.  This does not include those who like it but do not play it, it leaves 100 + 312 = 412 people that will play it.  However that does not\ninclude the 69.5 people who like it and don't play it or the 100 who don't like it or play it so you need that 114.75 in the equation.  To get 52.5 you\nmultiply 2.5 by 20. To add that, 2.5 is simply the number of people who like it as 100/24 =.42 so times 42 you get 2 people. Those who play it are 52.5 so\nyou have 52.5 players * 2 = 105 of those that like it.\n\n### Response for Input:A:\n101.247058823529 <br/>\n### Response for Instruction:\nJohn's thoroughness in the examination led him to what would have been? <br/>\n## Output: A:  the real cause of death and thus a potential lawsuit <br/>\n[Answered by: PinkSparkles905](https://api.codewarriors.org/q/24254143)", "answer": " 50"}

In this population of infected mosquitos, there are 4 mosquitos infected with malaria and 0 mosquitos infected by Zika virus. After taking the experimental malaria vaccination, Jack reduces his chance of catching maleria to 25% or a 1 in 4 chance. In the population of 4 mosquitos, 1 is still infected with malaria so Jack still has a 50 % chance of catching malarialis. This leaves Jack with a 25% chance of catching something from mosquitos. 25% of 4 is 1 so Jack has an 80% chance of getting caught with the other disease.\n\n### Feedback\nCheck your assignment to find out if it was passed or not.", "answer": " 15"}

In Western Christianity, the main difference is that a nun professes the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. In many Eastern Christian traditions the nun does not profess poverty. Both men and women may be ordained to the monastic orders in various Christian faiths; the term monk is therefore not exclusive to men.", "answer": " 6"}

The computer should not be counting 1's and 5's because they are the only ones that are divisible with 1.

This leaves us with 55. We then multiply this number by 0.25, this leaves us with:\n\n0.25 * 55 = - 13.75\n\n\n### Step 2\nNext, we can multiply this value by 20. This means that out total number of ants is:\n\n20 * -13.75 = 275\n\nWe round, this means that total number of ants who are workers is 15. \n\n\nWe round down!\n\nThe correct answer to the question is 15. It turns out that this question asked how many women workers there are when the male workers are only half the total, and only 20% of these are men. This is very easy to solve, as you can assume that each worker ant is the same as the average worker ant. \n\n### Solution - Step 1\nTo solve this problem, the first step is to get the worker ants out of the equation, the question was specifically not about them.\n\n\nWe have to determine what we now use to determine how many there are, because we have to figure out how many workers there are, given that we know how many male workers.\n\nSo many workers are of the worker gender, so we can use workers as the main measure of the problem.\n\n### Step -2", "answer": " 44"}

Just telling the student that the answer is 'D' may not help them figure out what the answer is.  It's better to tell them that the correct answer is the same as the question.

Traveling three times around the loop would make 4 turns total (turns of 8 meters each). 24 is 4 times the number in 8.

The driver was about to begin a 6 mile trip, so how much time is left in the hour?\n\n### Answer\n\nBased on the break, the truck can drive 10 miles an hour.  The first 10-min break was 1.1. Then was 2 miles to the left turn. (7.9) Then was 5 miles to the right turn. (12,7) Then there were 5 minutes of extra time added before reaching an intersection. This would make 19.66.

So, if we have $2, $4, and $8 saved for 4 total months, then for the 4 total months you would do:\n$2 + $2 + $4 + $8\nThen after, you divide like so: $24 / 4\nOutput:\n$2 + 16 + 32 = total savings of $60\nDivide that by 4:\n$60 \u00f7 4 = $15 per/month\nAfter\n\n### Output for each month with addition of $8 for every month:\n\n### Explantion:\n\n+ $2 for January\n+ $4 for February\n+$16 for March\n+ $2 for April\n+ $4 for May\n+ $8 for June\n\nTotal in 6 months:\n$2 +4 + 16 +8 + 2 + 8\n= $30\nSo, $30 divided by 6 months:\n30 / 6 = $5\n\n### Output\n$2 + $8 for March:\n$10\nAdd another $8 for April\n\n$10\n$8\nSo, we have: \n$18/2 for each month\n$9 per/month\n24/6 = $4\n\n### Output", "answer": " 126"}

{"text": "The wholesale price is 12/3 of the retail price, therefore the wholesale price is $4.\n\nInput: A store owner sells items that were purchased wholesale for $620. He made a 50% gross profit by increasing the price on a 25% markup. He then adds tax at 7%. What is the sale price of the item, including tax?\n\n### Answer:\nThe sale price of the item is $756.75.\n\n### Input :A person needs to buy $10 worth of apples with tax. There is a 10% tax on fruit. If the price of apples is $2/pound, how much are his apples?\n\n### Demostration:\nFirstly, we need to know the cost of a pound of apples. Therefore, the cost of a paw of apples is $0.80. Let's assume the person bought only one pound because that is easy to calculate. Now that we have our cost, we can find the sales tax. The tax rate is 10%. Therefore, 10% of the cost is $0.08. Therefore, the cost with a 10% sales tax is $0.98. Therefore, the total cost of the apples with a 10 % tax is $2.98. Therefore the correct answer is $2.92. Because $2.92 is more than $10, that is the cost. To make a $10 worth of apple with a 10 percent sales tax cost $2.92 including your tax, the 10% sales rate for the fruit.\n\n### Output:A man had a pair of shoes which was worth $12.25 before it was repaired.

I wrote down as many words as I knew.  I had \"desp(end)\", and \"pen\", and \"de-\" and \"de-sp\", and I was able to make the word \"despondent\".  I learned that one way to learn to write well is to write it down first on a piece of paper.\n\n* Keep a list of the difficult words you use.\n\n   As an incentive to write more words, I wrote a piece of writing that explained something that I knew well.

The instruction has 7 variables, but only answers need to be calculated.  The variables can be classified as those that have answers to questions, those that are questions and those that do nothing in particular, but need to appear in the result anyway.\n\nIn the 7 variable problem, only 6 variables have answers and the variable \"Input\" is asking a question.  There are 5 choices in the response, but only 2 choices (1 and 4) answer the question while 3 choice (2, 3 and 5) do nothing in particular.\n\n\nThe next step is to determine the syntax of the answer format.  For example, if the answer is a 1 or a 0, then all letters must be capitalized and only the first choice can be correct, unless the answer is a 6 or 9, then the first choice must be a letter.  If the answer is a letter, then only the first choice is correct and letters cannot be a digit. \n\nIn this example, the answer format is a string with 6 letters that represent an answer from 1 through 6.\n\nThe instruction says:\n\nWhere is a microphone boomed likely to be covering a...\n\nThis is an unusual word and is used to describe a microphone cover.\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer:\nInput: Where is where is a microphone booted where a mic is expected or where it is typically located?

If the numbers make their way to someone who can divide, they will be divided correctly, and the remaining problem for that someone to solve. Division is important.  \n\n### Response\n\nDividing 91 by 3 would result in 30.5. Subtracting 32 from 27 would result in 5. Multiplying 5 by 3 would result 15. Adding 15 to 30 (0), result in 30 again. The total cost of all four cartridges is $32 (the price for each color) but since 32 in 32 is 1, then the total cost is 1 * 32, or $32.\n\n### Input for task:How does the cartridge work?\n\n### Input answer to task:\nA cartridge consists of a collection of ink that will be applied to the printer's page. A color cartridge contains 4 ink. 1 black, so not 4, one for each color. 27 is the price for one color cartridge, while 32 is the price for one black-and-white. So if you buy 32 and 4 each, the price would be 91.\n\n### Task:Explain to the reader how your solution came about. Use the appropriate mathematical operations and concepts.\n\n### Response to task:\nI started off by adding the two cartridge prices, then substracting the black-and-white price from the color price. 5 was the result, and so to solve this I multiplied by the colors. The result was 15, so I added 30 to zero, and came up with the answer as 32.\n\n\n### Output for task:\nA great solution!  You used a lot of math concepts to get to the right answer.  I like that!

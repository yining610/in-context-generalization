Choices: 1: a desolate barren terrain 2. a contested area under control of no party 3. a country with no native citizens 4. a hostile or potentially dangerous area 5. an environment that is suitable for humans to live in\nOutput: 1.'No man's land' is an English expression for a contested area or region that is under the control of no country.\n2. The adjective used in the phrase \"No man's man\" is 'lands' in the third person which means that the phrase can be classified as a possessive adjective (the kind which describes something).\n3. Given the phrase's context, the only acceptable answer can be #3 because the phrase 'No man's land', literally means an area, which not belongs to anyone.\n4. The phrase 'No man' could be considered descriptive of the place or environment, not an activity, so answer 4 is incorrect.\n5.

In this case, 8 pages read in 20 minutes equates to 1 page per 3 minutes.\n3. Estimate the number of pages in the book. In this case, we will assume the book to have 240 pages, assuming that one section has approximately 16 pages, or 16 seconds.\n4. Calculate the book's required time. Multiplying 1 pages read per 3 minutes and multiplying that by the required number 121 pages per hour, this equates to 120 pages read in 1 hour or 2 minutes.\n5. Simplify. To simplify, the following formula can be used: 2*3 = 6*16 = 96. Since 121 pages = 6*24, this multiplies to (6*16)*24= 1024 pages = 24 hours.\n5. In this case, round down and round up. Round down to 23 hours, rounding to the nearest hour.\n6. Round up to 24 hours.

We know that Sammetha had three fewer letters than Bobbbee had originally. \n4. By adding Bobbie's original two fewer letters, her last name is now half of Jamie's. \n5. Therefore, Bobbie took of two of her original six letters. \n6. When Jamie takes two off her name and she has three, this creates an eight letter name. \n7. Bobbie took two of the three letters she had already taken off and Sammetha took another three. Now Bobbie has taken five. \n8. That leaves Jamie with two. 9. So Jamie took the last two off her name as Bobbie did and is left with an eight letter name. That is four letters fewer than Sammetha originally had and after Bobbie takes Sammetha'es first five letters off, she's left with three which is then half of Jamie'e's name.\n10.

{"idx": 27, "text": "1. Jack is stranded on an isolated, deserted island and needs salt to season his freshly caught fish. \n2. He has a bucket with a capacity of 2 liters to collect seawater, which he intends to use for this purpose. \n3. Considering the size of Jack's water container and that he only wants salt to season his fish, it's likely that he only needs a small amount of salt to complete the process.\n4. The question asks about the amount of salt Jack will obtain from 2 liters of 20% saltwater. \n5. First, given that the water is half liquid(the rest a solid, liquid mixture)and half water, the salt in the water can be calculated by multiplying the volume by the percent concentration of salt. \n6. Therefore, the amount of salt Jack gets after evaporating 2 liters of saltwater is (multiply the percentage of salt by the volume), which equals 2 x 20% = 0.4 ml, which is 400 mg.\n7. If we convert the amount of salt to weight, then 400 ml of salt is equal to 0.4 g, which is an extremely small amount. \n8. Therefore, Jack will only need a tiny amount of salt to season his fish following evaporation of the water. There's no need to look for a specific unit of salt.\nSo the final solution is A: Jack will need a little amount of salt to do so.\n\nInput:John and Jenny are in high school together but they both attend different schools.

{"idx": 30, "text": "10. The question is asking us about the percentage of Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income that she dedicated to rent and utilities each month.\n2. So, to solve this we need to find how much Mrs. Snyder was spending on rent and utilities in the first place and then how that amount has decreased.\n3. As the question asks what percentage of her income went to rent and utilities, we can assume the answer was at least 25% of the previous income.\n4. We will start by taking 25% from 100% to get 75%, which could be interpreted as how much of income was being spent on rent and utilities before the increase.\n5. We then factor in the new, higher income of $600 and see how much of her previous income that comes out to. This means that her monthly income was at least $1,800.\n6. Mrs. Snyder no longer spends 25% on rent and utilities, because her monthly income increased, but instead 25% on the increased amount in rent and utilities. We can interpret this as Mrs. Snyder now can afford to spend less than 25% of income on rent and utilites.\n7. Therefore the percentage of her previous monthly income is somewhere between 40% and $600.\n8. Now, to find how much it was we need to subtract the $600 from $1,80.00 which leaves $1,200.00 as the percentage of previous income used for rent and utilities, before factoring the new income increase.\n9. As the question asks only what percentage of income was used and not a specific dollar amount, we can assume the percentage of previous income is the minimum possible and that Mrs. Snyder can no longer afford to spend anything on rent and utilities as the number has decreased to 0.\nSo the final answers are 4 to 10% of Mrs. Snyders previous monthly income.", "answer": " 1000"}

{"idx": 51, "text": "1. The question asks how many chores are required to save for baseball season supplies, given the restrictions. \n2. The main task to be done for the task is the calculation of the number of chores he needs to do each month. \n3. Hence, to solve this problem we need to consider multiple parts: \n   1. How long is Gerald's baseball season? This question could be answered by simply taking the range between the starting and ending point of his season, which is a total of 4 months.\n3. When considering the chores per month, we use his monthly rate of $10 for each lawn care task.\n4. So, his monthly income is $40.\n5. His desired goal is to save up $100 for his season supplies, which is equivalent in this case to 2.5 times his monthly income. So, he needs to accomplish 2.5 chores every month on average to reach his goal.\n6. The question does not mention any constraints on raking, shovelling, or mowing. It is safe to assume that the options do not have any time restrictions or limits, but it would be a good idea to verify if they do. \n7. Therefore, we can find the possible number of chores he can do every month by counting the monthly income by dividing it with his average per chores rate.\n7. Hence, Gerald can complete the average of 2.5 chore every month.\nSo the final steps are to determine the total number of months for his season.\nOnce this is done, we can find the total number of chores required for the season by multiplying the chores per month number (i.e., 2.5 chorses) by the number of months in his season (i.e., his whole season is 4 months).\n8. Therefore, Gerald requires 100 chores in total to save up for his baseball season. \n9. So the answer is 100 chore.\n\n### Note\nThe first three grader math level problems were solved by a systematic approach of eliminating wrong choices and following the steps provided in the question.\nThe next one included several parts that needed to be connected in order to arrive at the most likely solution.\nThe final solution involved some complex calculations and assumptions that, unfortunately,", "answer": " 5"}

When looking at the bolt of fabric, it can be seen that it is 5 feet by 12 foot; by looking at the dimensions, it can be seen there are four equal sections with the width of the fabric being 5 inches. \n\nWhen looking at the length of the bolt of material, the length matches the 1/2 in, meaning it is 6 feet. Looking at the length of the fabric, it can be noted that the length of the fabric equals to the square of its width of 5 inches. The length, then, must be 25 in.\n\n6) Based on the dimensions given, Ann now has enough fabric to create two curtains a total length of 15/22 or 5/6 or 1/3 inches.

However, Hillary made 18 dollars in profits today, so she is not selling three crafts.\n3) Considering Hillary has 7 dollars in additional profit, we can deduce that she is selling at least 4 of the 13 dollar crafts since adding the profit of 7 dollars to the price of 12 dollars will give her at least 13 plus 7 = 20 dollars, selling at least 2 of the crafts to equal 20 dollars.\n4) This means she sells at least four crafts, and since she receives at least 11,328 times as much profit as she sells, the profit will be four and a half times her initial investment in craft supplies.\n5) Therefore, since her initial craft supplies investment was 150 dollars 45% of which equals 21.50 dollars and since she sold 4 crafts, she made 94 dollars in profit.\n6) From this information, we can deduce her profit to be 94 dollars with 18 dollars from previous profits being added to it to end up with 112 dollars as the total proceeds added to the total investment to end up with 262.50 dollars in total.\n7) With this information, multiplying the craft investment of 150 by the profit factor of 4.5, resulting in Hillary making 687.5 dollars in total profit.\n8) So the answer is Hillary made 687.0 dollars in total.", "answer": " 25"}

The total sale price for the 3 gallons plus 5 boxes is $150 before the discounts (because $5 = $10 + $5).\n4. The first discount gives a $10 total, which is $10 of $150, or 6.67%.\n5.

{"idx": 155, "text": "1.\"After two years\", we are asked to find the money Ariella should have after a specific time period.\n2. First, we need to find the balance of Ariella's saving account after two years by finding the balance after 24 months.\n3. This can be done by dividing the balance after one year by 10 to obtain the rate of simple interest. We can then multiply her balance after 1 year by the rate of simple interest multiplier which is given us in the question to come up with the balance after two years.\n4. So, we get $200/10=$20$+$20^200+20^2\n5. Now we know how much Ariella account balance was after two years.\n6. Now we find out Daniella's account balance.\n7. To find the account balance of Daniella, we need to add $400 simple interest to her initial amount.\n8. So, $400+400+4^2=$800+$400=1200$+400=$1600.\n9. Now we multiply Daniella's account balances by 2 to find out the final balance after two years. Daniella's final amount can be written as $1600\\times 2$=$3200$.\n10. Lastly, we subtracted the total amount Ariella had at the end of year one from those $3200$.The balance is $1600 - $200 = $1400.\nSo the final amount Ariella would have two years later is $1400$.\n\nInput:How many 7s are in every 10?

{"idx": 160, "text": "1.'At Mario's barber shop' tells us that the question is about a time and date at a specific barber shop.\n2.The question is about a price difference during different days of the week. In order to answer the question, we must first understand the question from Mario's perspective, as a barber.\n3.By understanding that, we can see that Mario may be charging more for his services on the weekends (Fridays and Saturdays) than on the weekdays (Monday-Thursday). This assumption is supported by the question's mention of the barber shop having \"haircuts\" at an increased price on the weekends.\n4.The given question asks how much Mario's last haircut would have cost, the day before it was given on a weekday.\n5.The question mentions that haircuts are 1.5 times more (50% more) expensive during weekends, at Mario's barber's shop.\n(This conclusion is based on interpreting the mention of haircuts being 50% more 'expensive' during weekends as a 1.5-fold increase because the percentage is taken relative to the base, which is the cost of the same service on weekdays). Therefore, haircuts are 0.5 times more expensive during the weekdays at Mario's shop.\n6.It's not mentioned how long Mario's last hairstyle was. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that it was longer than the average in the shop, which would usually require a longer time to cut.\n7.Given that haircuts cost 0.5 times (half) more on weekdays in Mario's barbers, the extra cost on a weekday may be interpreted as being a multiple of half the cost of the average haircut. Therefore the cost of a haircut on the weekends may be considered to be the cost of the average service at Mario's shop multiplied by 2. Multiplying a cost by 2 is an often means of expressing doubling the price.\n8.Mario's last haircuts' cost was $18 (8USD), which can be calculated by plugging in the previous numbers into the appropriate mathematical formula for a percentage increase:\n$18 x 1.5=27, which, rounded", "answer": " 27"}

{"idx": 172, "text": "1 The problem is about the number of trees that someone has planted.\n2. First, we have to understand what each of the options mean. \n3. A \"fruit\" refers to the harvest from a tree or plants; it's the finished product and not the raw material.\n4. A fruit could potentially come from a \"seed\" which is the plant's reproductive structure.\n5. Plants are generally made up of \"1 seed/plant\" and there are \"20 plants\" on \"each tree\" with each having \"60% of those\" being planted.\n6. There's no mention of the number of trees that have been planted or how many plants are in each of those trees. \n7. Let's consider each of our options: B: two and  E: 50. \n8. B: two could be inferred from \"each tree has\" 20 plants, which would then mean there are two trees. \n9. E: 50 could be because when we add the \"2 seeds\" per plant and then \"20 plants\" to each of the \"2 trees\", then it adds up to be 50 seeds + 100 plants. \n10.  But, we can't infer this information from the previous context of the question.  \n11.  The remaining options A: 2, D:1.5, do not fit in the context of the question and are incorrect.\n12.  So, it's clear that James planted 20 \"seeds\" or plants per tree.  There 20 plants per tree, which multiplied by 2 will result in 40 trees.  James planted 2 seeds, which multiplied by the 40, will result in 80.  He planted 60% of the 80, which results in 48 seeds; however, he only planted 6 fruits.\n13.  Thus, James planted 2 trees that each had 40 plants and 2 seeds, resulting in 80 plants and 20 fruits.\nSo the final solution is E: 50\n\nInput: Which country has the oldest university in the Western world?

The question states that the total sum spent was $28, implying that the cost of the soft drinks was $4. \n4. To determine the cost of the candy bars, after subtracting the cost of soft drinks, we must use the remaining amount of money - $24.  \n5. We can set up the equation like this Candy Bars = 5*X = 24\n6. Solving for X, we can get X = X/5 \n7. X will equal 28/5, giving 5.6 \n8.

The shelter was for protecting against a storm, but it was full as the cat ran off, so clearly it was trying to find shelter from the storm.\n2. Option F: under the bed, implies the cat is going underneath the bed to get some shelter and will not run away any further. Hence, it is eliminated as an option.\n3.

He plans to serve a total of 3 courses, and \"half of 30\" is 15 guests.\n6. Therefore, he plans to cook for 15 guests, even if the unplanned guests are different in number for each course.  \n7.

This gives us the clue that Tyson's job might be on the line and it would make him nervous.\n\nThen the questioner made it more specific, and asked \"What is one of the only things that is currently keeping Tyson employed at Target?\"\nThe answer is either that they have no one to replace him and make the same kind of money, and he would be let go immediately or that someone else at Target is in worse condition and he is in a better position.  Both of these could be one of the possible answers.\n\nNow the questioner makes the question more specific asking \"How would Tyson's current situation make someone else very happy?\"\nIf he was let go then his girlfriend would be very happy, and if he was not let go then she would be glad that he had a well-paying job. Maybe his mother-in-law is paying the bills and would be very happy that he did not get fired and could still work.  These things would make people very happy. \n\nNow the question gets very specific asking \"What does Tyson have only at home?\"\nThis is an even more specific question.  He has his 17-month-old son, the boy's toys, and food. He may also have a house and television. \n\nLastly the questioner asks what else might be important to Tyson's 17-month old son.\nThe answer would be playmates, a pet, or a favorite toy.  Any of these other things would make him very happy.\n\nThe answer would be a dog to keep the boy company.\n\n### Exercise\n\nThe exercise would be a paragraph of text in which there is a question followed by 5 - 7", "answer": " 54"}

The man will not make it in time, but we don't know how late he will be, or if he will ever make it.\n4. The man's inability to make it on time can be attributed to  his poor driving skills. Therefore it's more likely that he didn't make it on time than he actually did.\n5.

'Adding wood to fire' can refer to a wood burning fireplace and adding more wood to the fire to keep it strong and burning longer.\n3. Now that we have established what each action represents, let's consider each option.\n4. Option A: 'add water to wine' means to dilute or weaken the flavors, so adding water to wine would represent a weaker or less flavorful outcome.\n5. On the other hand, option A: 'fire' means something strong, hot, or burning, so adding it to water would represent the opposite - a cool effect or a weaker flavor.\n6. Option B: 'add wood to fire' refers to the act of adding more wood to a wood burning firehouse, so the addition of wood represents a stronger effect than the one used in Option A.\n7.

So, the number of eggs that Tank collected in the 1st run was 210 and Emma gathered 160 eggs in the same run, according to the second round of hunter.\n4. Since we know the total eggs in 2nd run was 60 and 400 eggs in total. If we consider 20 less to be the total number of eggs that Tanks collected in 1st Run, we can write N = 210 - 20 = 190\n5. There were 6 other participants involved, so we need to distribute them, 1 egg to each.    \n6. So, the total number of eggs = (60 + 160 + 190 + 360) = 1230\n7. The number of eggs that was gathered by the 6 other kids were 1230 - 400 = 830 eggs. \nSo the final answer to the problem is 830.", "answer": " 220"}

Cactus is a type of plant that can be very thorny and harm the cowboy, and also isn't considered a food. It doesn't fit the context of the question.\n4. While apple can be used as food and often has a positive association with cowboys in movies, it does not give the idea of a rugged cowboy and is not used by horses.\n5.

Now that the boy is afraid of the dog, the family does not do the same thing anymore or, in other words, the answer is different, that is, different from what the previous answer was.\n3. The in-laws are usually the next of kin of one's wife or husband living in another place.\n4. In addition, the word \"relatives\" refers to family members.\n5. Based on the above, C: going with relatives may be a suitable answer for the family before the dog started taking rides in the car.\n6. However, after the dog became an issue, the family no longer does C: go with relatives. This could suggest that A: visiting the In-laws would be a suitable answer, as this would be a way for them to keep the dog away from the car and still be visiting family, as the \"family\" has not been previously discussed, it is highly possible that the \"family\" is referring to the \"in laws\" based on the sentence structure.\n7.

{"idx": 253, "text": "1) At the start, we first take note of all the quantities mentioned in the problem:\nAngie bought 3 pounds of coffee. Each pound of coffee will brew 40 cups (40 beverages). Angie drinks 1 beverage (cup) a day.\nWe then determine the units of measurement to be used throughout problem:\nEvery pound of coffee, 40 cups, and 1 cup are measured in pounds (lbs), not fluid ounces or ounces.\n2) Next, we first solve the unit conversion for each piece of information:\nEvery pound (lb) is equivalent to 16 fluid ounces (oz). Every 16 fluid ounce (oz) is equivalent to 0.1683 quarts, or 0.18 cup, or 1.2 c and 13 tbsp.\n\n3) Now we use the unit conversion to determine that 1 lb. of coffee, 45 cups of brew, and 3-4 cups a day will last Angie: 1 lb. x 45 cups = 27 lb (48 cups) for 3 days, 45 cu (94 cups) in 4 days, 139 cups (0.441 lb) in 5 days, and 198 cups (0.593 lb) in 6 days.\n(The final figure is also equivalent to 6.548 days).\n\n4) As such, Angie\u2019s coffee will last her for: 6.547 days (exactly 7 days).\n\nSo the final answer (approximately) is 7 days\n\nInput: What was the name of the famous author that wrote about the Hulk on Monday?

For the second gym John paid $60 in the first year.  \nNote that, while John could have picked either gym before picking up the second gym membership, he did not know the price of second gym until he picked it.  Hence after he's picked the second gym, he paid total $60 at signup fee, and $640 during the year.

{"idx": 304, "text": "1. The problem statement as posted, asks Tommy to purchase the most flour for the least price.\n2. This information directly points to the cheapest flour per pound, not the cheapest flour overall. \n3. Further, the question makes clear that the purchased flour is going to be thrown away, so the only option in the final cost is the monetary expense. \n4. There are two prices given both per lb and per 10 lbs. \n5. The question makes clear that 1 lb of flour is exactly equal to 1/4 of a loaf of bread. \n6. The question also specifies that the flour is needed to make the 12 loaves. \n7. From all these statements it follows that the number of loaves and the number of pounds of flour per 12 loaves is the same.\n8. The question then goes on to state that for cheapest flour, the 10 lb bag costs $10 and the 12 lb one costs $13. \n9. If we apply the calculations, we get that a 1 lb bag of the more expensive flour is $1/3 $1.07/33 (not counting taxes, etc...) \n10. Therefore, Tommy would spend $1.07 (3X $1+ TAX... )if he purchased the most expensive flour. \n11. The same result is obtained when you set up a proportion, because:\n- 1 lb = 1/4 lb = 1/12 loaves\n- The more expensive flour is 1.3 times the price of the cheaper flour (as indicated by the 10 lb and 12 lb prices given) and the cheaper is bought 3 times as much as the more expensive\n- So when we set up a proportion with the numbers provided, and with the number of loaves the same over all bags of cheaper ($16)/[number of lbs of cheaper flour purchased/12] = number of lbs of expensive flour purchased/[number of lbs cheaper flour purchased times $16 or $1](156/225=$0.68375...)\n- which results in the same answer of $1.07\nOutput:", "answer": " 50"}

{"idx": 328, "text": "The answer is 1.\nIf each mink has 15 offspring, and each of these offspring have 6 offspring, the number minks in the whole group goes up to 43. The first 20 minks have 6 children, so there are 120 minks in total (20 minks have no offspring). The other 50 are set free, so there are 70 left. \n\nBut these 70 minks, when each one has 6 offspring, only make another 420 minks (not six times 70). So the total amount of minks is (120 + 420) = 540. The coat is of a fixed size, so it does not matter how many minks are there they will need 15 each. So the mink count at any point can be represented as 15. If the total population of minks is 44, so the population at any given time is 15%. \n\nA coat only takes 15 minks, so the total population of mink of 44 means 2 will be left out. The coat size is 15 minks (15%, 15 \u00d7 =7.5). Therefore the number of coats is 27.\n\nThe last part is how many minks remain unaccounted for after the fur farming and activists, so (44 - (540 - (27 * 15))) = 64\n\nNow 63 mink have 6 children each for a total of (46), which we already know is 15%.

Choices:  B:  because its against their beliefs A: b.c. of an insurance claim C: D: because they think it will do no good E: F: the patient doesn't like the prescription or the drug\nOutput: A. This can happen for several reasons, including that the diagnoses of the doctor was not correct or the doctor did not take the full range of possible causes or treatments into account.\nA doctor may prescribe a drug to treat a condition, but depending on the particulars of the individual's condition and other factors, the drug may not provide any benefit.\n1. This could be due to a medical misdiagnosis or if the patient has an illness or symptoms that other treatments are better suited to address.\n2. In addition, the patient may have an adverse reaction to the drug or other unforeseen circumstances that make it ineffective or harmful in cases where a patient may be receiving a drug that conflicts with their beliefs or values.\n3. If it is determined that the patient's condition is not properly managed, a doctor may not be properly treating their condition.\n4. This could result in the patient being adamantly against taking a drug that has been prescribed to them.\n5.

{"idx": 361, "text": "1) We can start by understanding the given information that Sonja uses a ratio of 2:8 while she is making her peanut butter. So what could be this ratio in a direct proportion representation? It would be 2/8 = x/20.\n2) We can further simplify this by dividing both sides by the left side. Doing this will give us x/2=5.\n3) So what that basically tells us is that in each 20 ounce batch she makes, Sonja uses 5 ounces of oil.\n4) The next step would be to make sure that we are not using the same value, so we will add 5 to the equation to get 5 + 5 = 10.\n5) So now since the result is a direct proportion representation Sonja uses 10 ounces of oil per 20-ounce batch.\n6) Therefore, since Sonja used a total weight of 20 ouncers in the blender we would need 2 times a 10 so the new equation would be 2*10 = 20.\n7) To check, we would have to make an example which is like Sonja's.\nIf the blender took x ounces of oil and Sonja used a ratio of 2:(8), the blender would now take 16 ounces of oil (2x8).\n8) In this way, the answer (10) can be confirmed and is, as a result, correct\nSo the final answer would be 10\n\nInput:A man lost his pet and the dog ended up on the neighbor's doorstep.

While Matt worked 210 minutes on Wednesday, the question explicitly states that we are comparing Matt's work on each day.\n5) Choice B is 110 minutes. While this works out to be 110 minutes, it doesn't work out to be a difference between two integers (a - b).\n6) Choice C is 140 minutes. While this would be a possible answer if it were \"a minus b\" and one could use this formula to determine that the difference was equal to \"140,\" because it is not an answer to the question, it can be excluded.\n7) Choice D is 45 minutes. Since neither choice C nor D provide an actual solution to the question, they are both excluded as answers.\n8) Now, we are only left with the correct choice E (350 - 180 = 170).\n9) To summarize,  the correct answer is E.\nSo the final is E: 170\n\nInput: The new car can drive on the road for 23 MPG.

Where could a cat fly faster than that? Choices: \nA: 300 miles from the ground B: the sky C: outer space D: a plane E: the world\nOutput:You can travel faster than a bird (300 mph) near or above the ground, where the air pressure is decreased.\nThe velocity of a bird depends on the altitude of the bird. The velocity of a moving object depends on two things: The speed (velocity) of the object, and the resistance of the air. \nBirds and other animals fly by thrusting their wings upwards, causing air molecules to flow from the wing to the wing. As the air travels along the wing, the wings get pushed down while the air underneath moves to the tip of the wing. This lift creates thrust and propels the bird upwards. \nBird flights are powered by two-phase airflow: During the downward stroke of the wing, air flows along the wing and produces almost no lift. During the upward stroke of the wing however, lift is significantly more pronounced.\nAn aerodynamic explanation for why that is the case involves the Bernoulli effect. The wings move from high pressure areas to low pressure areas, and experience a decrease in pressure on the upper surface and an increase on the lower surface. That lowers the drag and thrusts the wing outward.\nThe Bernoulli equation is an equation that describes how pressure and speed change in the flow field of a moving fluid. A very simplistic version of this equation explains that as an object moves through a fluid at a higher speed it creates a low pressure zone.\nFor example, a helicopter that flies through the air is actually flying in a low pressure area. A jet airliner flying at 600 miles an hour (about Mach 0.84) has a lower pressure zone on its top surface and high pressure zones on its bottom.\nThe Bernoullies principle states: Pressure decreases as the fluid increases in speed. Speed increases as the fluid decreases in pressure. The Bernoulli\u2019s principle essentially means that an air flow", "answer": " 58"}

{"idx": 438, "text": "1.\"First, in order to calculate the total sales amount, we need to subtract the total cost (including feed) of all chickens. \n2. To do this, we start by subtracting the feed cost per chicken (2x0.5) from the sales amount (1.5x65), which results in the final cost per chicken of $1.30. \n3. Next, we subtract one chicken's feed cost ($2+$2=4) from this total cost per chicken ($1.30-$4=0.30), yielding a feed cost per chicken of $.30. \n4. Finally, we multiply this feed cost per chicken by 6 (=$.60x6) to find the total feed cost, which is $.30x6=$.18, or 18 cents. \n5. To get to the final answer, we must subtract the total feed cost of $.18 from the total sales amount of $65 to determine the net profit, which is thus $.42 (=65-64.82).\nSo the final answer (in integer numerals) is 42.\nSo the final solution is 64.82 -> 42\n```\n\n## # 74\n\n# 74.

{"idx": 442, "text": "1) The question says that Martin invited all the people who are related to him and people from his work, school, and sports club. Because people from his work, his school, and his sports club represent 50% of the total invitation, we can assume that only 5 invitations are left, that means 5*20% = 1 invitation.\n2) So, according to the provided answer the question is \"The total of the remaining invitations represent 100% of the total people that Martin can potentially invite. How many people did Martin invite?\"\n3) We can rewrite the problem in this way: 100% - 50% = 50%\n4) So, 50% of invited people represent all people invited, and 50% - 5 = 45%. Now, we need to know how many people Martin invited: 45% of 50 = 22 1/2.\n5) Finally, we can say that 1 + 22 1 /2 - 1 = 23 1 /2 people or in general: 20*100%+19*%50+10*%40+9*%30+8*%20+7*%10+6*%005+5*/5 - 1 = 1 + 20.5+19.5+12.1 +8.5+4.7+2.3 +1 = 23.375 or 23.4(2 dec).\n6) That means when we find 23.4 (2 dec), it is the same as 23.3 rec.\n7) As we know that 1/2 = 0.5\n8) Therefore, the answer is : 23.5 people", "answer": " 36"}
{"idx": 443, "text": "The cranes were 118% taller than the buildings they were building.\n1. The first question the crane is that it is 228' tall; the second is that it is 120' tall; the third crane is 147' tall.\n2. From this, we can see that the first crane is 128' tall, and the second is 108' tall. \n3. We can also find the average of the 228' and the 120' from the first problem. This gives us a number of 172.\n4. The third problem states that the one final crane finished a building that was 140' tall.\n5. This means that the distance between the final crane and its building is 40' long. \n6. The distance between the 3rd and 4th cranes gives us 237.\n7. This means that 128' + 237'/2 = 172.5. \n8. As this rounded is 173, this means that the second crane is 26' or 11% taller than its building.\n9. The third crane is 37' or 25% taller than its structure.\n10. Therefore, the average height between the cranes is calculated to be 88' and the buildings as 76'.\n11. This means that the cranes are at least 19% taller than its buildings.\n12. We can therefore find the average percentage between the two and use it to compare.\n13. The percentage is.19; this is equivalent to 19%.\n14.

First step for this question is to determine the total pay.\n3.) There is no information about the specific pay that John receives, so we need to infer the average in order to proceed.\n4.) As the problem specifically references \"same percentage\" of the total amount he makes every year as a bonus, this means that the percentage bonus he receives is also a percentage of his total pay (including total pay and its bonus).\n5.) In this case, the information given in the question is \"last year he made $120,000\". So, the total pay last year would be $120, 000+ 10, 00, = 130, 001.\n6.) Now to apply the formula (of $130, 361) to this year:\n  (Total Pay)*(Pct bonus)/100 = Base Total Pay\n7.) So, the total pay this year comes out to be $200, 261.\n8.) Next, we can work our way towards what John's bonus would be this year by using the information from the problem.\nFirst, the total pay this ear makes would be $180, 00*100=$ 18, 000\n9.) Next, the bonus to his total pay would be determined based on the percentage of his total pay from last year: (Pct bonus from last year)*(Bonus from last year)/Base Total Pay = Bonus to his total pay this year.\n10.) Applying this formula to this problem, the total bonus earns this year would come out to be ($180, 260/130,001) = ($1364.93)\n11.) There would be one more detail to the overall amount John receives this year.\n12.) This is the total sum of John's total pay and bonus.

If we look at each player's wins and losses separately, Carla won 15 games and lost 15 games, and Frankie won 15 games but lost 30. The difference is five games, or 5 games. 3.

{"idx": 467, "text": "1. The question is about estimating how many hours worth of days remain for employee Mark's 10 sick and 10 vacay days after he consumes half of each category of days.\n2. The context indicates that each day in Mark's allocation of sick and vacay days is equal to 8 hours of work at the company location, Snowflake Plastic. \n3. As we know that Mark used half of both sick and vacation days in a given year, we can assume that Mark used an equal number of days under each category.\n4. Let\u2019s find out the number of sick and vacation days consumed so far. \n5. The total number of sick days consumed can be found using the PEMDAS rule.\n5. The total sum of sick days consumed using PEMDAS can be calculated as:\n`2 days * (2 * 8 hours) = 16 hours`\n6. Similarly, the number of vacation days consumed can be calculated as: \n6. `(5 / 10) * 10 days` = 5 days  \n7. Therefore, using the above sum of sick and vacation consumption, Mark had consumed 21 days altogether.\n8. By multiplying this number by the number of hours covered in each category, we find that Mark had left `21 * 20 hours = 420 hours` worth of days of sick and vacay he could schedule or use.\n9. So the final answer to the question is D: 420 hours\n\nInput: At the hotel, the king and queen had a big feast for all the people in the kingdom. Which meal?

The question states he walked 2 miles to a grocery store, yet, the question doesn't give enough information to calculate this value.  It only states the number of miles to the pet store and back to compare.\n2) We then attempt to use known values to solve the problem.\n3a) We know that the two mile and the four mile walks are the same.  Thus, the difference between the 2 mile and the 4 mile walk is 2 miles.\n3b) We know that we have an initial calculation of 3 or more miles.  This calculation is the result of the two less than two mile walks.\n4a) After reviewing the question, and recognizing the error, it appears that the question originally stated that Hadley walked 1 less than 2 less than two miles.\n4b) We can convert this into a negative value due to the inclusion of the less than two miles.  This converts the difference into a positive value due to our addition of the negative 1 less than two.\n5) We now know that the result contains a positive 2 mile number. This is because there is an additional 1 mile, not subtracted from the 2 mile.  This means we now have a positive 3 mile value.\n6) We now know that Hadley walked three miles in his cowboy boots.\n7) This seems to be the correct solution of the question, but we can improve upon it significantly.  By finding the commonality, we can remove the extra unknown that exists within the question.  We must now find a way to reword the answer to remove the extra mile the Hadley walked.\n8) We are attempting to convert the final mile into a negative number.  We also know that the question has a positive three mile value that we previously isolated as our final answer.  We can now find the difference between the two, which is 3 minus 1.  Thus, since our answer is positive 3, we only need to subtract 1 which results in a negative 2.  Here, we can reorder our formula to provide exactly what we want.  By removing the 1 mile added in and rearranging our formula to provide a negative instead of positive, we now have our final answer\nSo the final answer should be C) Negative two miles", "answer": " 6"}

The initial sentence and question \"used the scanner at Kmart\" suggests that the context is located in a physical space like a supermarket or retail store.\n2. The \"he\" in the context refers to the boy, who is an individual shopper. \n3.

{"idx": 501, "text": "1) The question refers to three individuals who play a game of \u201ccatch\u201d with Joe - Derek, Tammy, and Joe.\n2) In the problem statement, we are asked to evaluate catches made by Derek, Tammy and Joe during the game.\n3) In particular, we are interested in finding the number of catches Tammy made during the game.\n4) To calculate it we need to apply the following statements of the problem: \n4.1) The total number Tammy caught the ball is the total quantity after taking away a third of the quantity of catches made by Drew.\n4.2) Tammy caught the ball 66% of the number of times that Joe did. Since 66% is a lesser fraction than a half, we can conclude that the number of catches that Tammy and Joe made is not the same.\n5) From this, we can conclude that Joe made 25 catches, Derek made 16 catches and Tammy made 19 catches (3 times more than Derek).\n6) Since Joe caught the ball 25 times and caught the ball 2 less than two fourth\u2019s the number of times he made catches, he caught the ball 22 times.\n7) Since Derek caught 17 catches and this is 4 less than two forth\u2019s the number of catches he made, Derek caught the ball 13 times.\n8) Thus, Tammy caught the ball an amount equal to 66% of Joe\u2019s quantity (19 catches), which equals 13 catches.\nSo the answer to this question is C: 13.\n\nInput: If someone has a cold.

How many different types of food does one need to survive in order for that frog to live for an entire month?\nOutput:: First we would calculate the frog\u2019s food requirement for 1 day. Assuming that it eats food which gives it 900kcal, and 1cal is 1.1J, calorific value of the frog is 900/1.1 = 820 Joules. So that is 820 J + 820 J x 30/1 to get the total energy requirement for survival of one month. It is now = 24,600 Joules. 24,6 =246 g food.

Let's convert I:O into a ratio first: 336:124 = 336/124, where the numerator and denominator are both positive integers. So, we can simplify the ratio to 336:4. This tells us that for every 4 books taken out, there are 336 left in the library.\n4. Substituting the value of 22 into the ratio above (I):(B):(O) = 336:22:124=5:314:124, which simplifies to 5:314=8:79. \n5. Thus, there are I:O:B ratios of 8:79:124, each day after taking books out. \n6. We can simplify this to 8:1:109=8:109 as there are 8 books remaining, taken out of 109, after each book had been taken out. \n7. For the first day (and any other date after this one), the I:O is simply 8:109. \n8. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we have I:O:B= 109:109:124. \n9. We can't reduce this further, since for every I:O there needs to be enough books for I*O*B. However, if we multiply both sides by 124 to eliminate B, we get I:O=124(109:1).\n10. \n11.

This leaves us with 4 tasks she needs to complete, involving 27 miles of driving.\n3. 27 miles x 25 miles per gal x number of gallons = total miles x gas cost = total cost for gas.\n4. In order to get from her home to the first destination, she needs to take 8 miles. To get from the first destination to the second, she will travel 6 miles. From the second to the third destination, she needs to travel 12 miles. And finally, from the third destination, which involves driving back to her home, she will need to travel 23 miles. So the math looks like this:\n5. 8 + 6 + 12 + 23 = 63\n6. 63 divided by 25 gives 2.5434.\n7. Therefore we can calculate Carla's average miles per gallon: 2.54 miles per gallon.\n8.

So the first question we ask is how many cards we know we have, and the answer is 2.\n2 Now, we can do some simple math to find out how many gift cards there are. In this case, there are 11 cards total based on the 6 cards we know about and 5 extra cards we don't know about.\n3 To answer the question about what the total value of these cards is, we multiply the number of cards (11) by the amount on each card (200). When we multiply 200 X 11 we get 2,200.\n4 The problem is that we don't know how many of these cards Jack has sent. But, if we knew exactly how many cards Jack had sent, we'd know the entirety of the amount he can receive back.\n5 And since we don't know this amount, we have to make an educated guess based on what we do know.\n6  So we know that Jack has sent 2 codes, which is a fraction of a total of 9.\n7 So, we just have to calculate what percentage 2 is. We will do this by subtracting 2 from 9 and dividing the result by 9. To do this, we're going to use the long division method.\n8 First, we divide 9 into 2 to see what quotient we get. We know that we're going to end up with a whole number like 50 when we do this, because the division will end in a whole number. So, 1 X 2 = 2 so we split it into 2 groups of 1. \n9 And, since we are dividing 9 into 2, we end up with a remainder of zero. So then we subtract the remainder, which is zero, from the divider, 9, to find our quotient, which is now 50.\n10 In this example, our remainder is equal to zero, which is a divisor of 9. And because of that divisibility, you'll almost always get a whole number when finding your quotient.\n11  Now we're going to divide the number we got from the division in the previous step into the second set of numbers from the beginning -", "answer": " 3900"}

We can use this information to simplify the relationships between the people in the family and the formula for finding the average age between people.\n5. By subtracting Betty's age from her daughter's age, we can find the difference between the two. Using the same formula as for Betty's daughter, the difference between Betty and her daughter can be translated into Betty's age minus the product of 40% of her daughter's age and 3, representing the relationship of one person to Betty's granddaughter.\n6. By multiplying both of these values together, we can find that the average age of the three people in the family is equal to Betty's age minus 40% of the product of Betty's age and 40% of 3. We simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by Betty's age, resulting in Betty's average age minus Betty's age divided by Betty's age equals Betty's age minus one-third of Betty's age, which simplifies to Betty's age plus one-ninth of Betty's age equals two-ninths of Betty's age or 29 years old.\n7. Therefore the granddaughter is 29 years old, equal to two-ninths, minus one-ninth or nine-ninths, of Betty's age of 60, which is 30 years old.\nSo the final solution is 30 years\n\nInput:I would like to invite you for an open house, but I don't know you very well.

The question asks how someone could get the money they need in order to buy a cupcake after being told that: \"if she had a pound [British currency] she would want a cup cake.\" \n2. A choice: \"Ask her parents.\" makes little sense as cup cakes are not usually given as currency. \n3. A choice: \"Walk her dog.\" also makes no sense in the given context. \n4. A choice: \"Earn [their] own money.\" is not something a child is likely to do, and would be too big a task to fit in one question, as well as the other contextual pieces. So this is not a viable option.\n5. The choice: \"Work at a dog grooming salon\" is also not viable as children would likely not have the appropriate job credentials or experience in order to be hired. \n6. Finally, as the question asks about the \"money\" specifically to \"buy\" a cup cake, it might make sense to go back to the original context of the question where it mentions that the child has a pound, which leads us to the correct choice: the child can wait until they have a \"little to spend\" on the cup cake.\nSo the final answers is 2.

{"idx": 569, "text": "1\"Cost\" is typically a value that is measured monetarily in some manner.  \n2. To answer the question, we need to look at the cost of raising a specific child. \n3. It's important to look at all the details in the question, including how John pays for everything.  \n4. Considering the question, the cost of raising a particular child is not just a number and is in some way relative to the costs of raising other children.\n5. For example, the cost could increase or decrease if John's costs were to change when he has a second child.\n6. Additionally, the cost of raising the child can vary depending on the country the child is born in, the family's wealth, and the child's specific needs and traits. \n7. All of this implies that the cost is not a simple, single answer like the \"it cost\" part of the question.\n8. Rather, the cost includes all factors that could impact the cost of raising a single child, such as whether he has a sibling, how much wealth the family has, and how many years it will cost to raise the child. \n9. To answer the question then, we must consider every year from the child's birth to age 18, and take into account the yearly costs.\n10. In the question, we have all three parts required to calculate the cost:  the years of child's life, the yearly costs, and how John should pay.\n11. The question asks, how much did it cost, but we will need to find the yearly costs in order to determine the most direct answer. We will then calculate the total cost, so the answer is the total cost.\n12. However, since we know that John pays only half of the cost, he will then pay only half of the total yearly cost for each year of the child's life.\n13. We must therefore, calculate half of the total year cost by multiplying it by 0.5. \n14. This would give the total cost that John should pay and the total cost he did pay for his share of raising the child.\n15. Since John pays for only half of the child's yearly cost, the total value must be calculated by taking half of the total year's value of raising that child.

Choices:  T: not a lot  G: warmth H: fresh air I: going outside  F: snow\nOutput: 1 The answer depends on whether you are talking from the perspective of an adult or child. \n2 The question asks about \"snow days\" or days when schools are closed due to weather conditions that are likely to result in treacherous roads and hazardous conditions.\n3 It is expected that children like going outdoors and engaging in activities such as making snow angels, playing in the snow, etc.\n4 However, this sentiment may change if the weather is especially cold as they get older. Even if they're enjoying playing outside, they are not likely to \"like\" the weather itself. \n5 For an adult or adult learner, the idea of being able to stay home because school is closed is often a desired benefit of a \"snow day\". \n6 Therefore, from the perspective of an child or adult, the answer will likely change: from \"not a lot\" and \"fresh air\" when looking at what children like, and from \"warmth\" and \"staying home\" when looking at what adults like. \n7 Thus, the right answer is T: Fresh air in the case of children, and Warmth for adults.\nSo the final answers should be: T: Fresh air, A: Snow, G:", "answer": " 760"}

First, to find the number of rectangular tables, 7x10=70 pupils can read. \n4. So we need 20 more pupils to read, so 90 pupils need to be read at the same time. \n5. Now, we will find the number of square tables (10x4=40 pupils). \n6. In the process, we will find out how many square table need to be added to the current table (rectangular) \n7. According to the question, 90 pupil can sit at the same time if 70 of these pupils (10x7) can sit at a rectangular table. If this is so, then we don't need to add any new tables. \n8. However, there are 20 more pupil who can't sit at the rectangular table, so we need to find out if we can satisfy these pupils with the current tables. \n9. We will first find the number of pupil who can sit at the current rectangular table. \n10. We can see that 1/5 of them can't sit at a table and need an extra table. \n11. So 5/5x40=20 of the square pupils can be satisfied with the rectangular tables. \n12.

Note that if we chose option B or D, 90 pupils is not the solution. To find out the number of pupils who can be read at once with these options, we will find how many square table the choice will need. \n14. The option B says 36 pupils will fit on the table.

So, how many more tokens does Sandy have than any of her other siblings? The question states that Sand will have more tokens than any of her sibling. This means that after splitting up the number of tokens, each sibling has less than Sandy.\n9.)

Some ways make more sense based on the words that were actually used, and others have less relevance. \nIt may be possible to say that \"Do I really want...\" is a statement that may not be completely true, while \"Do I want...\" has an \"am\" that implies you do want to be with these people.  And another interpretation is that \"I will have to sleep\" is a phrase that carries the force of a statement, not a question.  You aren't sleeping.  You are either going to do it or not.  This sentence is about the person's sleeping location and the fact that they are in another city.\nTo answer the questions, some of which are about the situation (i.e., should I sleep in my own bed?); the first sentence says the situation is not what the person asked about (sleeping with other people), so the person needs a new question.  A question that would be answered with \"yes\" is likely: \"Do I want to be with anyone?\" The question the person asked could be understood to mean, \"Do I want to sleep in my own home or do I want to be around anyone / other people?\" which requires another question such as, \"Do I want someone to be here?\" This question is related to that of whether the person will be around anyone / other.  Both of these questions refer to another person sleeping in the room, which is why the person needs to know the answer first.\n\nIf the question was, \"What do I want to do?\" then the answer would be \"I want to be with my family,\" which suggests the person's desire to sleep in their own bed, since it", "answer": " 1000"}

Secondly, Kris decides to enlist in her brother's help to increase the total number of balloons she can blow up before the 30 minutes is up. \n1. Kris can blow 2 balloons per minute, which means she can blow one after 30 seconds and another after 60 seconds. This results in 120 secs spent blowing balloons in 30 minutes with the two people involved.\n2. This 120 secoonds can be divided evenly between her and brother.\n3. Her brother works \"twice as fast\" which means he's twice as efficient. \n4. So, if Kris can blow 1 balloon every 30 seconds, her brother can blow 2 baloons in the same time span and hence 2 balloons in a minute. \n5. This means Kris can then blow her balloon after 30 seonds and her brother's after 15 seconds.\n6. This results in Kris blowing balloons for 45 seccosonds in the first 15 minutes and her brother for 30 seconnds.\n7. Her brother now doubles his speed and can blow 4 balloons in one minute.\n8.

Jack is taking some unknown vaccine to reduce the chance of getting infect.\n5. We can assume that this vaccine is equally effective for both Malaria and Zikka virus, else it should be stated in the problem.\n6. There are two scenarios in this problem - Jack getting bitten by an uninfected mosquito and Jack getting bitten by a mosquito infected with both Zikka and Malaria.\n7.

Now, 50% of Zikka virus bitten mosquitos won\u2019t infect Jack.\n8.

If we know that A has bought Red and Blue candles in the ratio 5:3, We can determine what ratio A has of Blue and Red candles.\n\n7. The formula for Blue and Red candles given by A is given by:\n\nBlue = (Blue \u2013 Red) / Red\n\nor\nBlue= (34/34) * Red= (5/5) * Red= Red\n\n8. Since the denominator is always 1 and the value of blue is also 5, it can be replaced as Red.\n\n9. Which gives the following equation:\n\nBlue= Red/Red = Blue\n\n10. This can easily be re-written as: For every one red, there are 3 blue.\n\n11. A person has 45 red candies and needs 3X the amount of Blue candies.\n\nX=28.\n\n12. So we know 38 red candles.\n\n13.

The options provided indicate possible constraints or circumstances for Pete to consider when taking his trip. \n3. As we can see, we are asked to decide on a time Pete should set to take his trip if he cannot get to Los Angeles later than 7:00 AM (Pacific Time).\n4. This means that we must first calculate how long Pete must travel, taking into account any potential restrictions. \n5. So, the first step is to calculate the travel time between Pete's home and Los Angeles. \n6. To do this, we can find Los Angeles, California on a map or online map service, and then note the distance between the two locations. \n7. Using this information, the travel time can be calculated using the formula of miles traveled x 60 minutes per mile\ndistance between two locations x travel speed in miles hours per minute.\n8. As we calculate the distance between the home and Los Angeles, California we can consider that travel time = 80 miles / 60 minutes, which equals 1.3 hr.\n9. Taking the 80 miles as a figure from when we want to meet our destination of Los Angeles by 7:00am, Pete will have to leave his destination at 5:30am.

The statement, \"There are more books,\" can be used to estimate whether it is possible or impossible for all four people to have the same number of books. \nIf the question reads:\nHow many cakes should each of the three team members bake for lunch?\nThe statement is:\nThere are more than three cakes needed, and we don't need enough for three people. \nSo the estimation is that all three people must have the same number of cakes.\nTo apply this strategy, you should understand what your question is about and what it wants to find out.\nYou may have to look at the characters in a story to estimate whether the characters are able to share some characteristic, and whether the relationships between the characters could lead to sharing between the people sharing something.\nIf the answer to your question includes a \"tell\", then there is an opportunity to apply this strategy.", "answer": " 175"}

How much will 5.5 lb of water expand when converted to steam? \nOutput:  The question here ask is how much will 5.45 of water expand when converted into steam\n\nSo firstly it can be said that we need to add the weight of water in cubie centigrade\nand then divide it by the specific heat capacity of water\n\nSo 5.5 lb = 0.5 lb +116.16 oz = 116.76 oz\n\nSo (116.75)/ (1.0 oz) = 116 oz\n\nNow we get weight of water in cubic centigrade from given equation\n\nNow water mass = (5534*(15.3))\n\n= 82.9116 lb = 82.9 lb\n\nNow weight of water + weight of steam = 83lb\n\nNow (116.5) / (83 lb)\n\n= 1.4 oz\n\nNow how much of water mass become steam = (1.4/15.3 ) x116.5\n\n= 0.796 x 116.5= 94.0995\n\nSo how much of water became liquid stean is 94.0 lb\n\nSo total conversion = 83 lb +94.09 lb= 177.09 lb\n\nSo total mass is 177", "answer": " 146"}

The speaker's response doesn't specify, so we have to consider the context.\n5. If a job has multiple sub-tasks, it's possible one or both of them keep a checklist, and they may add tasks to it, while checking the tasks off.\n6. We also know that we're referring to the \"work\" mentioned in the question.\n7. Finally, the fact that the answer is in the form of \"yes - sometimes\" implies that at some point, it is relevant.\n8. Therefore, by process of elimination and considering the context, we have to conclude the answer is E: yes - sometimes.\nSo the final conclusion is E: yes - \"sometimes\".\n\nInput: Which of these tasks was done this morning? Choices:  G: cleaning out the garage H: feeding the dog I: vacuuming J: mopping the floors \nOutput:  G: cleaned J: mopped\n1. The question is about certain tasks done this morning. It says nothing about what they were, and just lists multiple options. So we can eliminate choices that don't fit that criteria, leaving H, I, J, and G.\n2. Option H: feeding the pet doesn't meet the criteria either, as it wasn't done this morning, but rather daily.\n3. Similarly, option I: vacuuming is about daily maintenance of the room", "answer": " 20"}

{"idx": 690, "text": "1.'Going downtown for a date' may refer to going somewhere that is unfamiliar or out of the norm, like a restaurant, rather than a location one typically frequents, such as a neighborhood.\n2. If Trevor is trying to save money going downtown, then he may choose to go to a restaurant for his date that is within a certain area or neighborhood.\n3. In this context, the neighborhood referred to could be downtown, where there would be different choices of restaurants to go to for his date, such as eateries and other local businesses.\n4. Now, we have to consider which mode of transportation Trevor will choose to get from the restaurant to his home.\n5. In the context, Lyft and Uber are options for getting around the city.\n6. A taxi is not a common and popular mode of transportation within the downtown neighborhood, which would allow Lyft and Uber to be more convenient and appealing options for the date.\n7. Moreover, if Trevor doesn't want to pay for a ride in an Uber or Lyft, then he could choose the more traditional option of taking a taxi.\n8. Uber is not always the cheapest option of getting around downtown, especially if Trevor is comparing the costs of an Uber, a Lyft, and a taxi ride. \n9. In such scenarios, an Uber ride can be pricier than a taxi ride, which would make paying the tip a reasonable choice.\n10. With all the available information, we conclude that Uber's cost is 22 with the tip included when compared to the Lyft's cost of 26, and the taxi's cost of 32, which could result in a difference of $3 more for the Uber ride, and $6 more for the Lyft ride.\n11. Considering Trevor is trying to find the most cost-effective way, he may opt for Lyft as the only option that is cheaper by $2.\n12. The final answer is Lyft, which is $26, with the tip included.\nSo the final tanscript answer is C: lyft\n\nInput: What place to you know best?

To start, the first thing to know is that we have no information about if Isabel's money is in cash or coins. This information is important for the calculations.\n2. Next, we know that she \"had some money\" that she spent, so we cannot use 51 to represent her money in total at the beginning. \n3. Instead, we will start the calculation by subtracting 25.50 from 51 to give us 20.50 in coins or cash. \n4.

Choices:  Screw might get stuck in the chuck Screw might snap in two Cords might prevent it D Hand may get injured or fall from the scaffold E Hand movements may be hindered\nOutput: 1 The screwdriver is easy to use because it works like a lever to untighten the screw.\n2. The screwdriver's handle and bit are attached to each other by an internal joint, or collet. \n3. The collet is an open-ended cone shape that matches the shape of the screw head to allow it to sit snugly and securely.\n4. The screwdriver fits easily in the collet and then, when the screwdriver is turned against the screw, the collet rotates and turns the screw.\n5. A lever effect occurs because when the collet turns, the bit end of the screwdriver turns with it, resulting in a greater amount of torque applied to the screw than could be applied if it were just being turned by hand.\n6. This ease makes the process of untightening a screw easier to do with the electric screwdriver.\n7. It is because the weight of the screw, the friction between the screw and the screwdriver's bit, and the weight of the electric screwdriver itself conspire to make turning the screw with a hand very difficult and likely to cause injury to the hand or arms.\n8.

This implies that houses in an area where food is stored might also have an attic, rather than a basement.

If you add all the pieces of fence up which Ben covered and divide by total area of 100-ft fence, it will come out to be 120cm/1000cm =0.12 which is not required.\n6. We have a 12cm of fence which isn't covered by Tom's Friends and to add all these answers we can just multiply all the numbers and sum them up.\n7. 3.60+120+120x.8+126x1.6=422cm/100\n8. 100/422 = 4.3648cm = 4.37cm and it will always be 4.37 when nf100 is divided by (f100/f20)+(f100/3f5)+(f10/7f15)\n9.

A 2 hour delay causes the train to be 1 hour behind. If the delay has been introduced again, how much further behind will the train be 3 hours after the introduction of the 2 hour delay?\nOutput:1) We know that the amount of time the train traveled before the delay is 4 hours, so we know that x = 4 hrs.\n\n\n2) Thereafter, after the delay it traveled 1 hour more which makes it 5 hours later in the delay, we can use the equation x = 4h \u2013 1h which gives us x = 3h, so x = 3h \u2013 1h = 2h. This gives us a more accurate answer in terms of how much time it took to delay. So after the 2 hour delay, the train was delayed x = 3h or 3 hours.\n\n\n3) After the second delay, the train travelled 2 hours after the original delay, making it be 5 hours of total time of delay. Therefore x = 4h - 2h, or x = 2h, so x = x + 1h, so it took an hour longer for the train to get out after the second delay.\n\n\n4) Finally, after the third delay, the train travels 3 hours at a speed of x after the 3rd delay. So by the formula we know that x + (x + 1) = 5 hours. We solve for x and get x = 2h.\n\n\nSo the final answer for the original question asks how many more miles does it have 3 hours after the original 2 hours? After this we get 3 more miles\n\n\nInput:The company sent to all of its employees a large box of new supplies and they each had what?

We also know that Tom\u2019s ingredients cost $591 per dough ball (without the promotional costs) and that Tickets for the world\u2019s largest ball cost $10 each.\n4. There are 48 dough balls for each ton of flour and ten dough balls for each pound of salt.\n5. So the question can be simplified as follows: 48 dough-balls made of flour, each weighs 48 pounds, and each salt dough ball weighs 10 pounds.\n6. After subtracting the ingredients from the sales price, we are left with $576,148.42 before promoting everything ($20 \u00d7 500 \u2212 $6286.88).\n7.

Since each potato costs 10 cents, the price per potato is 10\u00a2 and the salt is 2$ per container then the total amount it will cost is 240 $10 for potatoes x 60 servings 696$ 1320 $10 for 1320 potato + 60 $12 for salt = $240 + $720 = $960 for the first batch and 120 $10(10 cents for 1 potato) + 60 $2(2$ for a container of salt) = $120 + $120 = $240 for the second batch.\n6.

{"idx": 772, "text": "1.) If we are talking about actual slices of bread, the answer is 10 bread packs. (20 slices divided by four, which is 8 sandwiches made from two slices each.)\n2.) If we are talking two full packs then the answer is 4 bread packs. (A full pack has four slices, so divide five (the number of sandwiches made by Jimmy) by four (the number of slices in the pack). 4/5 is 0.8. So Jimmy is making one sandwich per pack.)\nSo the final answer should be 1.) 10 (20 slices) divided by 4 (number of packs) which gives you 10 packs.\n3.) If we are talking four full slices per pack, then the answer is 2.5 bread packs. (Divide five (number of sandwiches made) by two and you take away 1 (which is left over from the slices in each pack). 2.5/4 is 0.625 which is rounded to 2.5.)\nSo the final answers is 1.) 1 bread packs and 2.) 2 packs with four slices\n\nInput:Anna's teacher gave three children identical tasks - one was to plant vegetables, another was to take photos of the vegetables that were planted and another child was to take pictures of the flowers.

{"idx": 773, "text": "1) Kylie works with an hourly rate to pick apples.\n2) First hour she works at a rate of 66/hr. To pick 66 apples she has to work for 1 hour.\n3) We know from (1) that Kylie worked the first hour at a constant rate of 66 apples/hr.\n4) The second hour she picks at a rate of 132 apples/hr. To pick the apples Kylie has to work for 2 hours so we find the constant value of the rate in (3). So 66 apples will be picked in 0.5 hours. We call this the instantaneous rate by which Kylie picks the apples.\n5) In the 3rd hour she picks apples 1/3 of the rate she did in the 1st hour.So the total number of apples picked after 3 hours is apples picked in the 1st hr x the instantaneous rate over 3hrs. The rate x total time = total apples. This helps us conclude that she completed the third hour with 22 apples.\n6) The total number of apples she picked in 3 hours is the same as the apples picked in 1st hour. Thus, for 3 hour she picked 66 x the instanteous rate in (4) = 66 x 2 = 132 appals.\n7) Thus, the total number of appls she picked in 3 hr was 132.\nSo the final ans is Kylie picked total 132 appls.\n\nInput:When my grandpa met her at the airport, he realized they are not related, what would he have seen?

Rather, James sold another bike and bought the new one.\n3) James can only sell the bike if he has one. Therefore, since he sold a bike, he does have 1 bike, and he didn't sell it for less than he bought it for.\n4) This is important because the selling of a bike causes the value of a bike to become equal to 80% of its initial cost.\n5) This is the reasoning why the selling of a $500 bike for $400 is not profitable at first due to selling a bike for less than the original cost of that bike.\n6) That reasoning is why this problem takes place only when the bike James sold was not the bike he originally bought which resulted in him having 1 bike left.\n7) When the value of a bikee is 80% of the initial costs after James sells a bike for 8% more than the original cost, the cost of a bike becomes $125, not $500 when James first bought it.\n8) The cost of the bike he bought for $125 would result in his buying it once the cost of the other bike is subtracted from the grand total of $3000.\n9) This is why we have this equation: $-3000 + $500 = $-$1500 to calculate the value of the bike James bought and sold\n10) Therefore, he sold a bike for $480(less than the initial $500 cost).\n11) When $480 is subtracted from the $300, we get $280, which should be used in the calculation.\n12) Since James returns the TV that cost $750, we can use the initial total value of $300 to calculate the final value of the toaster.\n13) The 50% of that initial value of $30 is the cost", "answer": " 2020"}

We then note that the Chrysler Building and Leeward Center have a total of 24+11 = 35 floors, which means that there are a total of 11 more floo.\n4. Now to determine the final answer, we first subtract 35 from 35 to isolate only 11 more flooring and then find the number of additional floors on the Chrysler Building from that point.\n5. The sum of 11 and 35 gives 46 and subtracting 46 from its original value of 35 gives us 8 more floors, so it must be Chrysler Building has a total of 44 floors.\n6.

Since he only caught half as many pieces as Julie, he must have caught twice as many as Stan.\n3 We know that they collected a total of 41 pieces, so Carlos and Stan cannot have each collected the same amount; they must have gotten different amounts, which means that Carlos caught twice as many as Tabitha at a minimum. \n4 Since Julie got half as many as Tabith, Carlos must have caught half the total pieces collected by his three friends. We have a total of 49 pieces; 22 from Tabitha, 13 from Stan, half as much as Tabitha's, so we're left with 13.\n5 So with that, Julie must have caught 10 pieces, Carlos must have caught 9, and Tabitha must have caught 22, bringing the grand total to 49.\nSo the final question is:\n Julie caught how many pieces of candy?\n Julie caught 10 pieces of candy.\n Carlos caught how many pieces ofcandy?\n Carlos caught 9 pieces of candy.", "answer": " 72"}

Choices: 1: the time the purchase is made 2: the person who makes the purchase 3: the amount of tickets purchased 4: the demand for certain performances within the show 5: the show\nOutput: 1: The price of a ticket is likely dependent upon the time the purchase is being made. \n2: If a show is sold out, then there tends to be an increase in the price of a ticket, as demand will increase even higher in this case. \n3: If a show has been popular for a while, then there is no guarantee that the price will stay the same, and the seller may decide to increase the price in order to stay relevant. \n4: There is likely a different price for each performance. Each show has its own set of performers and the cost of their travel, as well as other production costs, that make up the performance. By performing more than one time, the seller will be able to offset some of their expenses by selling to an audience repeatedly in the same location. \n5: This is unlikely, since the price of a ticket is usually controlled by the individual seller or merchant.\n\nSo, 3 is the answer.\n\nInput:If you run out", "answer": " 80"}

Choices: 1. heavier than the man's umbrella 2. heavier than the umbrella 3. the same weight as the umbrella 4. smaller than the umbrella\nOutput:1. The umbrella is stuck to the rock, so we can't take it as a free variable to calculate its weight.\n2. The man and the umbrella are only two pieces of \"belongings\" as described in the question.\n3. Therefore, the umbrella is either the same or smaller in weight compared to the rock.\n4. The man is able to lift the umbrella in the first place since it is lighter in weight.\n5.

A prime number is the smallest positive whole number that can only be divided by 1 and itself. This means that 2 is prime. Then, 3 is prime. 5 is not prime. 21 is prime. 6 is also prime. 7 is also prime. You get the idea. If a number is not prime, meaning that it has 1 or more factors, it is not prime.

We'll divide that number by two to get how many cars were added at the back and how many at the front, as there were twice as many at the back. The starting number of cars were 100, and we know there were 700 at the end of the show, so there were 360 added in total.

Of these features, mountains do not extend very far into the sea, stopping short at the surface.\nThus, there are no mountains in the open sea, where there would be coral reefs.\nSeamounts are volcanic features like mountains but are submerged beneath the sea surface. So they are not what we are seeking.\nLava and seamounts flow from volcanoes but can also form the basis of coral reefs, so lava flows are not an answer either.\nSo we are looking for coral reefs or a place where coral reefs can be found. \nTherefore, the answer is B: volcanoes because coral reefs are not on the ocean floor, only volcanoes are.\n\nInput:Which is the correct sentence?\n A: I like that I get to eat whatever I want.\n B: I get to eat whatever that I like.\n C: I get whatever to eat that I like.\n D: I eat everything whatever I like.\nOutput:This sentence is problematic, as there are three places a comma might be used to separate two ideas.

Therefore, total number of eggs needed to make 155 omelets.\n2. Small children, older children, and adults can each have an omelet made using 2 eggs. Therefore there will be 53 + 75 +35 = 163 of these each eating one omelet. It would require 2 x (163) eggs to make all the omelets used by children. There would be 37 + 75 + (155 - 68) old and adults who will need to eat a half omelets each and this will require 53 + 53 = 106 eggs.\n3. Children have 2 omelets and adults have a total of 4 omelets, therefore the total number of eggs used for children is double the number of eggs needed for adults. 2 x(53) = 106 (106 + 53) eggs are needed for children and\n4. 2 x (75) = 150 eggs are needed for adults.

{"idx": 859, "text": "1. The question wants to know how many bars of cash he took that would put him over the recommended added sugar consumption of 150 calibers.\n2. The first part of the question states that Mark took a soft drink with 2500 kcal in the afternoon and that 5% of them was from added sugar.\n3. Mark then bought 5 candy bars with 25 calibers of added sugar, which would mean that he exceeded the recommended caliber consumption by 100%.\n4. Now we will need a formula to solve the question.\n5. The question states that he took 5 candy bars which meant that 250 calories came from added sugars.\n6. This allows us to say that he consumed 250 * (5%^2) calories from added sugars. Or 12.04 calories of added sugars.\n7. Thus, the question is asking how many bars of cake did he take, such that after consuming them, he exceeds the limit of 150 kcal of added sugar by 250 +12.04 = 262.04 kcal.\n8. This is equivalent to 6 candy bars.\nSo the final equation is (250 * ( 5%^2)) kcal = 6 kcal.\n9. In simpler words, 250 + 12.02 kcal = 6kcal.\n10. Since 250 + Kcal = 6k cal, we have 250 + (12.02 * 100) kcal = 6K cal\n11. Thus, 250(12.02) kcal = 156 cal, meaning that Mark took six candy bars with 156 cal of added sugar, which exceeded the recommended limit of 154 cal by 156 \u2013 154 = 2 cal cal.\nSo the final answers is 6 candy bars\n\nInput: I often travel on the number 23 bus, I am in the habit of taking it every Monday and Friday.

The person in the sentence already has plans for the date, so they will not forfeit those plans in order to go to the game.\nNow, let's focus on the second phrase\"Skip\" \"Skip\" has two meanings here, both of which are relevant to the context: verb and noun. \"Skip\" as a noun refers to play or entertainment. The other noun interpretation is \"a step, jump, or motion\". \"Skip\" as an adjective refers to one type of entertainment. The other adjective interpretation of \"skip\" means \"superficial\"\n\nNow that we know the meanings of the terms, let's consider the options:\n**A: game** will not be a problem. The only phrase that has to do with games is \"skipping the game\" which is unlikely since the question has already addressed why I can't go.\n**B: weekend** will not be an issue. Skipping weekends refers to doing things or attending things such as going to a game. The weekend has nothing to do in this sentence with skipping the weekend\n\n**C: plans** \"I'd skip a weekend to attend a game\" does not make sense. It shows preference over plans. This rule out the possibility of \"skip a weekend\"\n\nThus, the answer is **C: plans**.\n\nInput: You can tell from the picture which team won! \nOutput: The first picture represents the start of the game, while the second picture shows the end of the game.

{"idx": 865, "text": "The total number of coffee cups brewed in one week:\n\n1. The question is about the number of coffee cups a coffee shop brews in one week, given its hours of operation. So, we first need to figure out just how many brews the coffee shop will make in one week in terms of the number of hours of operation and the total number of brews per week.\n  \n2. Each coffee shop brews a total of 180 coffee cups in one week, given 5 hours of operation per day.\n3. Therefore, to find the total number of coffee cuits brewed, we solve for 'n' (i.e., number of brews per one week) given 'N' (total number of brews for the week) by dividing 'N' by 'h'(hours of operation per one week) to get:\n'N = nh  ==>   180 = n*5    ==>    n = 180/5   ==>    n = 36 cups of brews per one day of operation\n  \n4.

The difference is one. The 6 in the complaints bin were taken from all 5 rows with 5 notes each and also the extra 2 that were mixed in. This leaves us with only 9 notes from the other 4 rows. Because the compliment bin has 5 notes taken and the complaints bin had 6, it must contain 7 more notes (3 for each of the 5 row). This is because the 5 notes taken out of each of the rows leaves us with 2 with one less taken from each row. It leaves us with 3 notes each remaining. Because  the bin must contain 7 notes to make up for the ones that had been removed, we're left with 9 + 7 = 16. \n\nInput:In what sport should you not attempt a perfect score?

A perfect score of 180 would likely be accomplished by more than one style, therefore one cannot guarantee that a perfect score would be achieved in Darts. By eliminating Darts, the choices become limited to the remaining 5.  2 Pool has a variety of scoring mechanisms and styles that one could use to achieve a perfect score of 400. While not impossible, there are too many ways that one could do so to declare that the sport does NOT have a perfect scoring mechanism.  3 Jumprope offers no method of scoring a perfect score.

We can use Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse (length of the dangling tail). \nHypotenuse =   sqrt (adjacent^2 (10 ft) + opposite 2 ft^2)\nHypotenuse (length of tip dangling) =  sqrt (120 ft^2 + 4 ft^2) = sqrt (124 ft^2)\n\nTherefore, the hypotenuse (tip dangling) = sqrt (244 ft^2) or 16.54 ft\n3. Length of broken dangling tip = hypotenuse squared - whole flagpole length ^2 = (16.54^2) - 12^2 = 0.766\n4.

There is no restriction or condition on the number of strawberriees per basket, so it's a possible scenario that each basket had 15 strawberry, in which case there would be 60 strawberries total in all the baskets Kimberly, her brother and parents.\n4).

Choices: A: sketch B: painting C: carving D: sculpture E: digital art\nOutput: We are asked how an artist might create a portrait of a world leader. \n1. At first glance, a sketch seems like the best choice. However, there are a few things to consider. \n2. A sketch is usually much simpler and less detailed than a painting or sculpture. \n3. Portraits of world leaders are often highly detailed and very accurate to the real person, so it may be difficult to achieve this level of precision with a sketch.\n4. In addition, many world leaders have a very distinct appearance or appearance, including clothing, hairstyle, etc., that it may be difficult to capture in a sketch.\n5. A painting or sculpture, on the other hand, would give the artist more time and freedom to work on the portrait and capture the individuality and significance of the world leader. \n6. While a digital art might have some advantages in terms of speed or flexibility, it is more likely that a physical medium such as a painting or sculpture would be used to create a more impressive and impactful portrait.\n7. Therefore it is more likely that the artist would use a painting or sculpture to create a portrait of a certain world leader. \n8. Based on these considerations, the answer to our question is either D: sculpture or E: digital art.\n9. The next question is whether it would be a good idea to create a portrait of the world leader with digital art. \n10.

How fast the horses are going\n2. How much weight the wagon is transporting\n3. The friction exerted on the wheels by the road\n 4. Given: We know that there are 7 horses pulling the wagon (7 horses would generate adequate force to make the wagon go fast). We also see that we have 3000 kilograms to move (that is 3 tonnes). We now assume that the road is completely frictionless, and also, we're trying to accelerate the wagon to a certain speed.\n 5. Acceleration is force (toward a fixed point) divided by mass. The formula looks like:\na = F / mass\nIf there is a fixed target speed, we know mass, but we don't know force.\nWe have a force of 7 * 3000 * 9.8 = 97,800 N (978000 Joules), which, in the system of Newton, is an amount of force capable of moving 3 tonnes from 0 KPH to 12 KPH (which is a very nice start).\n 6.

To find out how many nuts are there in Mason's car, we can apply the concept of counting principle, which states that \"how many can be counted, how many cannot be counted\".\nFirst of all, let us determine the number of nuts that can be counted. 2 busy and 1 sleepy squirrels will stockpile 330 nuts in their 40 days of preparation.(2\u00d720+1\u00d730)=330\nNext, we can decide how many nuts we cannot count. According to the problem, we can't find all squirrels that had stockpiled the nuts. Furthermore, we might not even be able to locate many of the nuts. As a result, the number of stockpiled nuts in his car cannot be determined perfectly. Since the number of nuts we're searching for is finite(n=1,2,3...30), and it's impossible to know the exact figure of them, we can conclude that Mason's car can contain 30 or all nuts that have been stockpiled by 2 busy and 30 or all those that had been stockpiled by one sleepy squirrell.\nFinally, we can calculate the answer as follows:\nnumber of stockpiled nests by 2 busy squirrells = 330\nnumber of stockpiles by 1 sleepy squirtylls =\n\nSo the final answer would be\n30n\u00d72 + 30n\u00d71=600n\nSo the final answer\n```\n\n## What You Will Learn:\n\n### Basic Math\n\nThis quiz will challenge you to solve basic math problems, such as:\n\n* *Multiplying large numbers*\n* *Basic algebra*\n* *Basic arithmetic*\n* *Fractions*\n* *Rounding to the nearest whole number*\n* *Multiplications tables*\n\n### Time To Score\n\n* *15 Questions*\n* *5 minutes to complete*\n* *No penalty for incorrect answers*\n\n```\nHow To Enter:Go to the Entering Page at: https://mathquiz.xyz/basic-math-quiz", "answer": " 3200"}

Which two are necessary elements?\nOutput: \n1) When it comes to the law in this town, there are multiple aspects to it that must be followed.\n2) In this question, we first need to determine which two of the three conditions are necessary elements. This can be done by taking out answer options that are not essential elements.\n3) \"House-broken\" is not a necessary element as it can easily be removed and replaced by chaining or muzzling.\n4) Therefore, there are only two remaining necessary conditions - \"chained\" and \"muzzled\".\n5) These options should be considered separately. Consider the first \"chained\" option.\n6) \"Muzzled\" alone does not guarantee that the dog is under control. \n7) Therefore, we can safely rule out this option. \n8) Thus, the answer to this question is D: \"Chained\", \"Muzzled\".\nSo the final answer as \"Chained\", \"Chained\", is D.\n\nInput: During a race, I was surprised to see that I was doing faster than my average speed.

This means for every 245 pencil, Alexander is 1 year older, such as the gap between them is decreasing every time Alexander gets 1 year older.5) Let's plug the 1 year age gap into Asaf and Alexander' 50-x and 50+x equations. At the moment, Alexander is 55, which means x = 45, then the next time Alexander is 56, the gap between Asaf and Alexander will increase to -260, which means Asaf will have 76 more pencils than Alexander.The difference is decreasing every time Asaf and Alexander gets two years older. Therefore, we can write Asaf have 2x more pencils than they did previously where \"x\" is the age gap between Alexander and Asaf and in this case it is -245.We can use the same technique to calculate at any point the age gap between Asaf and X for a given x and find Asaf have 245 pancils more than before.So if Asaf has 50 pencils and Alexander 85 pencils: Asaf have 2(1", "answer": " 220"}

{"idx": 948, "text": "1. We are talking about Johnny's current amount of practice over his past amount of practice.\n2. This means that his amount of current practice must be positive, and his \"amount of practice as of 20 days in the past\" must have been negative - otherwise, the inequality would not work as stated.\n3. In order to solve this question and determine the final answer, it is essential to understand how the variables \"amount of current practice\" and \"amount of past practice\" relate to each other.\n4. The answer's given variables are X (amount of past practice) = -10 and X+ (amount of current practice) = 15.\n5. Johnny must have 3 times more practice than what he had as of 20-days ago and this is represented by 3X = 15 - 10, making the value 3X equals 5.\n6. Since X and X+ are positive variables, 3X is equal to (+3)(+X) by adding positive numbers together.\n7. Therefore X + 3X = 5 (X + 3X = X +3), simplifying to 3X = X.\n8. Solving for X by x = 3 (3X = X = 3X, removing X from both sides), X = 3.\n9. Johnny has 3 times more practice today than he did as of 20  days ago.\nSo the final answe is 9.

In this context, \"caused by cavities\" is not the best time to visit the dentist, but a time when a toothache is more likely to occur as a result of the cavity.\n3. Therefore, option 4, \"at night\" is incorrect. \n4. We know the patient is having a toothache from a cavity, thus the toothache is most likely to happen during the time of day when cavity symptoms are more frequent due to the presence of the tooth root.\n5. Since the most common time to have the symptoms of a toothache from cavity is in the evening, option 3, \"at night\" as the best choice (since morning causes too many other factors).\nSo the final question is what time is a toothache from the cavity most likely caused by cavity? \n6.

It states that 40 of the 80 guests are men, but that there are also twice the number (80) of children compared to the men.\n2. Now we can calculate the number of children by combining the men's total and the children's total after adding 10 children, such that the men are half the entire population of the event and the children are twice as much.\n3. We see that there are 40 men and 160 children, or 200 guests in total, which means that there are 4 men per child.\n4. Now we wish to know the number of men and children if we add 10 more children.\n5. Let's assume that we add 100 children instead.\n6. This makes the new total 100 men, 250 children, or 350 guests in total. (80 + 100).\n7. From this we can find the number of men (17 new children added) to be 5 men per child (70%).\n8. We can also find the total number of children by subtracting the current total of 350 guests.\n9. 350 \u2013 (4 * 250) = 350 - 1000 = -650, so there are 350 children if we add 70 children.\n10.

Choices: \n A: high heels B: tennis shoes C: sandals D: boat shoes E: boots\nOutput: 1.) The choices A: high heels | B: tennis shoes | C: sandals | D: boat shoes | E: boots  can all be eliminated.\n2.) None of the choices will break.\n3.) To break a shoe, the hammered nail must first penetrate the sole of the shoe before damaging the upper, lace, or other features. So, the answer cannot be any of the choices above.\n4.) The solution is to check if there is enough padding for the sole, whether it is sufficiently thick and rigid enough to withstand puncturing by the hammerhead.\n5.) It is best to choose a brand with enough padding in the sole and sturdy features, such as laces, and the right heel support that won't break with an impact from a nail being hammered in.\nSo the final choice is D: boots\n\nInput:What's easier to do, get to the surface of a pool or the bottom?

{"idx": 993, "text": "1. First thing to do is eliminate options that we know don't make sense.\n2. Since there are bananas, we know it's not an apple or any other type of mush.\n3. We also know that it's bananas because Hannah needs to use 3 flour to every cup of banana since banana mush is bigger.\n4. The flour needs to be used for each banana to make one cup of banana mash.\n5. One cup of banana munch equals four bananas: 4 Bananas = 1 cups * 3 cups = 12 Cups.\n6. 20 bananas equals 20/4 cups of mush or 5 cups.\n7. 12 is bigger than 5 therefore there should be 15 cups of flour used.\nSo the final conclusion is 15 cups.\n\nInput: The car is overheating because of the missing part of it. What is the missing part of the car? Letters are capitalized. Choices:  A) radiator B) fan C) water Pump D) motor E) thermostat\nOutput:1. We have to think about what makes a car overheat.\n2. The radiator is the part of the car that circulates coolant to keep it cool. There will be a missing part of the car that is preventing it from circulating coolant.\n3. Fan - This moves more air around the radiator increasing the efficiency in cooling.\n4. Water Pump - This takes the coolant from the engine and moves it around again and back to the engine.\n5. Motor - This gives power to the water pump.\n6. Thermostat - This prevents the water pump from circulating coolant if the engine is too hot.\n7. Since we already looked at the radiator and it still overheats it is the thermostat since it still has energy when the engine is cold and the thermostat is not working.\n8. Therefore thermostat is the missing part of a car.\nSo the final explanation is Thermostat.\n\nInput: After seeing the movie with her dad, the boy wanted to find everything he could find about it online, including how does it end which means what?

This is a word problem that starts with a mathematical statement and presents a scenario in which the information is requested.\n2. This problem, in particular, calls for the values of the price of each short and top. This is the missing value for this question, and the values of the shorts have clearly been given $7 each. So, we need to know how much each pair of shoes cost $10 each and then, how much each top cost. \n3. The first set of 5 pairs of short cost $35 and the first pair of shoes cost:\n$$$35*2=\\$60$$$\nSubtracting $60 from $70 and we'll arrive at $$$10$$$. \n4. The second pair of shoes cost $$$10$$$ and we can subtract $$10$$$ from $$$90$$$, to reveal:\n$$$90-10-=\\$80$$$\nSubstituting this number in the price of the first set of pairs of shoes, we get that it cost:\n$$$15$$$ each pair of shoes, meaning each top cost:\n$$$8.50*4=\\$34$$$\n\n5.

{"text": "Noah's sales for this month total 16 paintings.\n\n### Rationales:The question asks how much money Noah is going to make in sales if he sells twice as many paintings this month as he did last month.\n\n### Because last month Noah sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings, we know that 12 paintings are the total sales of the month. If he doubles this month's sales, then there are 24 paintings total. \n\n### Since he makes double the amount, $60 and $30, the amount of money he makes is $240 in total sales.

The question asks how long it would take a person to read 14 pages if they read at a maximum rate of 1.5 pages per minute. The answer must be a number greater than or equal to 14 minutes.\n### 2. The answer is 7 pages per minute. This comes from dividing 7 minutes into 14 minutes and finding that 7 minutes is an output that is greater than or equal to one minute.\n### 3. There are two ways to solve this problem. We could use estimation and add up the number of pages the person would be able to read in a minute and a half. First, if we divide 1.5 minutes by 7 pages, we can estimate that each minute the person could read 2 pages. In 20/2 minutes, they could read 20/2 = 10 pages. In 23/2 minutes, they can read 23/2 = 11 pages. In 25/2 minutes, they'd read 25/2 = 12 pages. In 3 minutes, they'd be read 3 pages.

{"text": "John could lose money if he works longer in order to work harder and earn the performance bonus, or he could earn more money if he works the same number of days and earns the performance bonus.  It depends on whether or not the additional 2 hours at work costs John more or less than $20.  If it costs him $20 (he still earns $82 for a 2-hour increase in work), he makes $50 per day - an hourly wage of $83.33.

{"text": "The question describes a situation where Gail would have fewer fish in the second tank than the first tank.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. When Gail has four fish, she would have a total of 4 gallons of water in her first tank and 6 gallons of water in second tank, with 2 two-inch fish and 3 three-inch fish. \n2. Since she follows the rule of \"one gallon of water per each inch of fish\", she would not have enough water in the second tank to support 4 two-inch fish (4\u00d72=8), with 3 three-inch left at most. For supporting 3 three-inch and 4 two-inch, she would only have 2 two-inch in spare in the first tank (9\u00d72=18), but the first tank has only 18.\n3.

{"text": "Answer by writing: 336 - 536 = 200\n\n### Instructions:\nWhich choice best explains why the number of sentences the woman started with is 200?\n\n### Demosntration:\nInput: Janice can type 6 words per minute and today at work, Janice started typing a paper she started working on last night. She typed for 3 minutes, took a break and then typed 6 minutes longer.\nRationales:\n\n1. Janice can type 48 words in 3 minutes and 36 in 6 minutes.\n\n2. Janice can type at most 48 * 18 = 872 sentences in 3 minutes and then, she can type at most 36 * 11 = 396 sentences in 6 minutes. So, she can type at best 1268 sentences in 3 minutes. After she took a break, she was allowed to type again for another 3 minutes. This means she can type at most an additional 48 * 3 = 144 sentences in 3 minutes, which increases the maximum number of sentences she can type to 1608 for the current episode of typing.\n\n3. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, Janice can type at best 60 x 1608 = 9648 sentences.\n\n4. This means Janice types 9648 * 2 = 19,297 sentences in total. She started the day today. So, she can't type anything before she started the day today.\n\n5. This means she started the day with 9648 - 19297 = 9549 sentences.\n\n6. The number of sentences she started with today is 9549 - 19265 = 9716 - 1643 = 8073 sentences.\n\n7. And there are 8073 - 1000 = 7073 sentences she typed.\n\n8.

He had $16 but 30 cents so he had $13.\n\n### Explanation\nFirst, Paul took three $2 notes for the bread. He only has three $2 bills and 30 c to spend so that means that he took the remainder of his money. Then he took the remaining amount he had for the butter and he takes the four remaining bills to pay for the juice. As a result, he has five leftover cents which he keeps to himself even though they don't count as money.\n\n#### Actions:\nAs the question states he purchased 40.00 in groceries he used his own money to buy 40 cents.\n\n### Expiration:\n\nHe had $75.00 and 50 cents, so he took out 6 $1 and 1 $5 bill.

{"text": "We need to determine how many total jelly beans there are and which color they are, then use these to find the number of red jelly beans since these are coconut flavor specifically.\n### Rationale: First, we need to determine the total number of jelly beans. From the statement, we know that out of the total \"three-fourths are red\" and that \"one-fourth are coconut\". We can then calculate 2/3 * 1/4 = 33.1 % with the total number of jellies. This tells us that 33.1% of the jelly beams are red. Therefore, there are 33.1 * 8 = 267.6 red beans.\n### Rationales: There are 33.3% of jelly beans that are red. We can calculate this by multiplying 1/3 by 1/4. The statement gave us 2/3 was red, which tells us to multiply 2 by 1/3 and then 1/4. Multiplying these together shows 8 * (1/3 * 1). 1/3 is 0.333... Therefore, 0.33 * 0.33 = 0.111... When rounded to an acceptable decimal value, it is 0.12. To multiply that value by 0.12, it is: 0.12 * 0.12 = 0.0144. When rounded to an acceptable approximation, 0.01 rounded back to the thousandths place (1/1000th part of a unit) (round 250/1000 or any number in the same range to 250; do not round away from 250 to the nearest place). Multiplying the fraction 2 by 1 * 1 = 2. 2*1.12 = 2.24.\n### Rantaless: 3/4 * 1/4= 3/16. 3/16 x 9/16 = 3/16+1/16, or 1/4 of the red beans are coconuts.

The question asks how many cupcakes Jessa needs to make for 120 students since she will feed 3 fourth-grade classrooms and a PE class.\n4. Answer choice A: 30 is incorrect because it is a number that is not divisible by 30 and not relevant to the situation.\n5. Answer choice B: 100 is incorrect because one has to be divisible by 3, meaning the sum of the divisors must be equal to the number.\n6. Answer choice C: 90 is incorrect because 90 cannot be divided by any numbers between 1 and 3 to result in the sum of the divisor equal to the number. The closest one gets to is 6, but since 6 x 50 + 10 doesn't equal 90, it's unnecessary to add a 51st divisor to bring the sum divisor value to 90 with the number remaining the same.\n7.

Gary instead wanted to pay off the loan in 2 years. How much more is Gary\u2019s per day payment?\n### Demonstarion:\nInput: Gary borrowed $6000 from his daddy for the loan.  His daddy said he could pay him $800 per day for 5 long years. Gary instead wanted him to pay off the loan after two years. So, how much more is Gary\u2019 cost per day? \nRationales: Here I have taken some time to understand the question, then applied some calculations. Note that the 0.135 (1.35) stands for 1.35 % Interest rate. \nIn 5 years, there are 6000/0.135 = 44,423 days. In 2 years, however, there are 6,000/0,135*(2/365) = 58,823 days. Now, let\u2019s suppose he is paying $1 = 125 cents = $800.\nSo, \n\n$1.35 * 44423 = $6000 in 5 years\n\n$1.25 * 58823 = $7050 in 2 years\n\nSo, it cost him an additional 8500/7000 = 95% for him to pay $6000 instead of $6000 * 135days/6000days = $50*135 = $7000 * 8500% = $6250 for Gary\n\nSo, the additional cost for him was $6250 - $50 = $6200.\n\n\\$\\begin{align}\n$6200/2 = $30.5$.\n\nHence the cost is around $30.5", "answer": " 150"}

This matches the behavior of cats chasing or trying to catch rabbits.\n6) \"By jumping...\" is an important clue, as it indicates that the action of \"jumping\" is the focus of the phrase and not the verb.\n7) Finally, \"table\" is mentioned last, which suggests that jumping is over the table, but not necessarily on it.\n8) To summarize: The phrase describes the movement of a jumping cat, over a table.\n```\n\n### Instructions: Choose the correct response to the following prompts.\n\n### Prompt: 72 degrees fahrenheit is what temperature in celsius.\n\n### Response One: 72 x 9 x 5 = 78\u00b0C\n\n### Response Two: 1.8\u00b0C\n\n\n### Source: https://academicskills.gatech.edu/library/academic-writing/rhetoric-and-literacy/writing-academic-essays\n\n### Resources: [Cracking the Code: A Guide to Common Core Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Code-Guide-Common-Mathematics/dp/0375896888)", "answer": " 72"}

The question refers to pizza crust, which is the bottom or \"dough\" portion of the pizza.\n2.\"Where did it come from\" refers to the source or origin of the pizza crust.\n3. Pizza crust in itself refers to a certain type of bread (Bread), the source or origin of which can be Cake, Ravioli, Noodles, or Spaghetti.\n4. Since all of the options refer to a generic food source of Bread crust such as Cake, Noodles, and Spaghetti, we cannot pick a specific one among the choices as they do not describe the source.\n5. Therefore, this task should not be attempted if one does not have further information aside from Bread, Bread, Cake, Noodle, and Spaghetti.\n6. In case this is the only source of information, the answer is E: Spaghetti as Spaghetti is the only source that has Bread as its raw material.\n7. Since it is Spaghetti's main source, we can safely assume that the answer is also Bread. This is why C is incorrect, as the source could also be \"Ravioli\" which is an entirely different food source (it has Ravioli as its primary raw material instead of Bread).\n8. B is also incorrect because Bread is only one ingredient from among a number of other ingredients used to make the pizza, such as sauce; cheese, and other toppings which are not part of a Bread pizza crust. \n9. As a result, A and D are also incorrect as they refer to a single source respectively instead of providing more broad or generic information like Bread.\n10.

Dogs are often associated with companionship and are usually pets, so they are most commonly seen in a home or a park.\n2. Option A: in a car, is not as likely because they often stay at the owner's house. \n3. Option B: on a farm is possible, but it wouldn't be the main answer because farms are not residential locations.\n4. Option D: at a veterinarian is an incorrect answer because it refers to a specific context, not a place to find a dog. \n5. Option E: on a park is an incorrect answer because of the same reasoning above.\n6. Therefore, the best answer is C: in a home.

Out of the choices, a \"congregation\" and a \"church\" typically contain people who tend to be supportive of, or related to, gay marriage.\n3. \"School\" and \"library\" would not be likely choices because one would not generally visit a school or library to find people with interests pertaining to this topic.\n4. Thus, option D: congregation and option E: church would be the best choices.\n5. The congregation (e.g. a church meeting) or church (buildings used for worship) both relate to religious communities where one can find people who likely support gay marriage.\n6. Hence, one can go to a congregation or church of a like-minded religion and find people who support gay marriage.\n7. The correct answer is D: congregation or E: church.\n8. When you search through these places, you will find people who support gay marriages.\n9. The \"school\" and \"library\" are not applicable answers, as they don't have anything to do with finding people who have a stance on gay marriage.\n10. \"Protest\", \"library\", and \"school\" are all acceptable, but they are not the best answer, so their probability is less than 0.7.\n11.

{"text": "Kim's TV costs $5.60 to run for a week.\n\nRationales:\n\nFirst, a bit about amps. An amp (not to be confused with an ampere, which measures electric current in amperes) is a unit of measure for how much current (how many electrons) flow in electricity. \"amps\" is plural for amp. Amps and watts are often confused because they are similar units of measure for two different things. An amp is a unit of how much electricity is being used at a particular moment, and watts is the total average amount of power that is being used by an appliance or device over time. Amps measure the instantaneous flow of electricity. You might also hear amps being used to measure power, in which case they are plural for amp and watt in this usage. As electricity usage in a home increases, you will see a rise in amps as the electricity flows more quickly.\n\nAlso, \"125 amps per hour\" means that Kim's TV uses 262.5 watts per hour. We know the time (one hour) and the power (amps = watts). So we can find out the power (and watts) of the TV using amps and watts which is 262.8 watts.\n\nNext, we need to know how many hours the TV is used within a day. This means 4 hours times 7 days is 28 hours. We are given that the TV costs 14 cents, but we need to translate into our units, so we need to know how much 14 cents is in watts. 14 cents = 10.65 cents plus 3.40 cents. (The exact amount is irrelevant, as we just need to know a general ballpark.) 10.64 cents is 90.96 percent of a dollar, so 90.9 percent of a dollar is ~1.1 cents (about), or 11.37 cents.\n\nAs mentioned above, an amp is about 1/10 of a watt.

The problem indicates that the songs Jeremy listened to yesterday are fewer than the songs he listens to today.\n3. Let\u2019s analyze the choices one by one: \n4. Choice A: 5: Jeremy listened to 5 songs yesterday, but only 4 today. This does not meet the statement \"5 fewer\" which indicates that Jeremy listened to 9 songs yesterday and then only 4 songs today, meaning there are 5 fewer songs than yesterday.\n5. Choice B: 7: Again, according to the statement, Jeremy listened to 7 songs today, but only 4 yesterday, meaning that there are 3 fewer songs. But when combined with yesterday's number of 5, Jeremy listened to a total of 8 songs, which is not consistent with the problem\u2019s statement.\n6. Choice C: 8: There is a possible logical explanation here, as 8 is the choice that includes 5 from yesterday and 3 from today. However, the problem\u2019s statement specifically states, \u201cfive fewer songs\u201d which is referring to the number of songs Jeremy listened to compared to yesterday, indicating that he listened to 4 fewer songs than he did yesterday, meaning there are 9 songs combined. 7. Choice D: 9: Once again, 9 is the choice that includes the number of songs Jeremey listened to yesterday and today, which may at first appear to meet the statement\u2019s requirements.

Explain.\n\n### Rationales:1. First, let's consider what it means to say \u201cHe is tall\u201d in the past by asking what verb tense would be appropriate to use.The \u201cis\u201d part of the sentence indicates a present tense, so we know to use some past tense for the verb \u201cto be.\u201d \u201cHe was tall then\u201d would be more correct than \u201cHe is tall\u201d for this context.\n2. Second, let's consider why saying \u201cHe is tall\u201d might not be as correct. We know that the speaker is referring to something that already happened, which is more likely to be \u201cHe was tall\u201d in past tense. However, using \u201cHe is tall\u201d may work in other circumstances where the speaker might be suggesting something about the present or future. For example, if the speaker was speaking to a child (whose language skills are still developing) and using present tense might make more sense because they have not yet grasped some more advanced grammatical concepts yet. \n3. Ultimately, we can conclude that while this sentence is correct in some situations, it is not necessarily the best choice in this context due to its inconsistency with traditional grammar rules.

Thus, choice E is the wrong answer.\n\n### Choice A has some truth to it, meaning when someone has something they're waiting for, they naturally express looking forward to it, but it is a side point and does not show the purpose of the expression. You could say it for anything that's good to you personally rather than something in particular.\n\n### Same thing with choice B, if you plan something, it does not naturally tie into expressing anticipation or looking forward to it.\n\n### Lastly, choice C does not really match up with the question either. Free time does have something to do with liking something, since you can use your free time to enjoy things, but still, it does not mean one looks forward to something necessarily, meaning it's not the best option either\n\n### Therefore, option D is the best answer\n\n### When does it make sense to tell someone you like their dress?

Hikers commonly visit the following places: a lake, a river, a stream, a canal, or a brook. Therefore, the answer would be one of the options that is a location you might find on the trail.\n2. The correct answer should be something that is commonly found on trails. If a place is very rarely found on trails, it would likely be more convenient to leave it off the list of possible locations.\n3. Looking closely at each option, the choices that have locations on trails are B: a river and D: a canal. The most specific choice of the two is D: a canal, because it is not a particularly common place to find on trails.\n4. Choices A: a lake, C: a stream, and E: a brook aren't as useful for the question because it is only possible to find these locations on trails.\n5. A lake is generally located in a location with large bodies of water, which are frequently further remote from a trail's primary route.\n6.

Hence option E does not answer the question.\n\nOption B: the front yard: a front yard implies a small part of the garden and cannot be the entire garden.\n\nOption C: the backyard: the backyard also does not seem to encompass the entire garden, and even if it does, backyards typically don't hold flowers.\n\nOption D: the flowerbed: the flowerbed can only be considered the flowerbed if it is the only flowerbed in the garden, but it refers to the physical piece of land in which the flowers are planted. Thus, if there were others, this flowerbed' would refer to the piece of land housing all of them. This doesn't make sense because it would imply that the flowerbed would house more than flowers.

It took months to clear the debris.  The city then began a reconstruction project.  How did that project go? Choices:  B: slower with more efficiency A: faster than expected C: slower D: slower E: faster than planned\n\n### Rationales: 1)The question is asking what happened to the reconstruction project after the tsunami struck.\n2)Looking at each choice, there are ones that make sense. A: 'faster than expected' is more accurate than 'faster than planned' because it seems unlikely a project's time frame would be planned to be too fast, unless it's rushed to make up for delays.\n3)Option B:'more efficient' can be considered a good choice because it would mean that more can be accomplished with a short amount of time, but this does not directly explain why the project took longer to finish.\n4)C:'slower than expected' is more appropriate because this can mean that a project's timeframe was initially supposed to be one way but was later changed due to issues that happened. This is what is likely happening, and A: 'faster'. Since it was reconstructed faster, it was re-planned to be faster, meaning \"faster than expected\".\n5)Option D:'slower' would be incorrect because'slower' compared to what? It's not compared to something else, it's just slower than it should have been.\n6)E: 'faster than planned'. The only thing in the question that indicates that there was a time plan in place is the final phrase \"It began a reconstruction project.\" This only suggests that there were plans in the first place. \n7)Option C: Slower-than-expected is the only choice that fits. \nAnswer:C: \"slower-than-expected\"; this is also why I left A: \"faster\" as well; it fits here even though it doesn't in the context of the question.\n\n## See also\n\n* Rational Discourse", "answer": " 16"}

Choices: \nA: it declines B: it increases C: it stays the same D: it disappears E: they get more than enough\nRationales:1. The question is posing the question \"While eating one\u2019s own food, which happens [feels] when one feels a little hunger\"\n2. Appetite refers to \"an urgent need to eat food\" and \"a desire to eat more food than needed\". Therefore, for this question, \"While eating my own food\" we would refer to people who have a \"desire to eat more food than desired,\" which refers to a scenario where the person has their own food to eat.\n3. Let us take a look at each of the choices\n4. A: the appetite is supposed to decline while eating one's food. When we eat food, and our stomach is full, we have less appetite. And, so the choice B: decrease is incorrect.\n5. Now, take a look at choice C: \"stays the same.\" When we have food of our own, having food has nothing to do with appetite because your appetite should decline when you eat your food. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.\n6. Choices D and E: disappears/more than enough, are the best choices. They are the only options that explain that \"when you eat your own food, your appetite disappears/you would get more than enough\".

{"text": "Two pallets\n\n#### Rationale:\nEach pallet has at least one of each product category. From that we can see that each category has a quota. There are at least 7 of something, because 7 is 50%+25%+10%. Also from this, because the answer key states there are at least 20 paper products and paper items, there must be at least 12 categories. From that, we can conclude that paper plates, paper towels, and tissues are 3 of the 12 categories. And also, if there are 20 items, at least 13 categories. Next using 25% rule, the answer must be less than one. In that case, because all the categories must have at least 1 product, then at most there are 6 of each product. From that we can come to the conclusion that there are 2 pallets of paper cuisines. The reasoning is this: there are 50% of cups, but not 6 paper cups. Hence, we know there are less than 5 cups. This means that the 4 pallets are 10. So the answer must be 2.\n\n\nIn a certain city, there is a 50-50% chance that a person will not own a cat.

That, multiplied by 10 would also give you 18.5, because it is less than 20, the answer is 18.5 yards.\n\n### Input : The man in the picture is an orphan, a person whose parents have passed away.

{"text": "216.00\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: When does a snake shed its skin? Choices: A: when it dies B: only once C: whenever it feels like it D: every one to two months\nRationales:1. The question asks, specifically, for the time of year when a snake sheds its skin.\n2. This information can be derived solely by considering the actual shedding patterns of the snake, which is different from simply knowing when a snake shits.\n3. Now let\u2019s consider each option.\n4. Option A states that a snake will shed its skin only once during its lifetime. This option is incorrect, for a snake\u2019s skins are shed throughout its lifespan. Option D makes the claim that snakes shed their skin at \u201cevery one to two months\u201d. This can vary somewhat, but it is unlikely that a full year would pass between sheds.\n5. And Option C is too general, as the choice should focus specifically on the shedding pattern of snakes. Snakes will not shed their skin unless it is time to do so, meaning every once in a while, not whenever it \u201cfeels like it\u201d.\n6. Only option B: \u201conly once when it dies\u201d is a sufficient answer. Alive snakes only shed their skin when it becomes too large. This typically occurs several times a year. The death of a snake does not impact this shedding pattern.\n7.

{"text": "356 pounds  \n\n### Answer: D  \n\n### Explanation:\n1. The last section with the Salmon was confusing but it seemed that salmon made up 50% of he remaining weight it needed.\n2. We knew that the bear gained a 1000 pound weight so we must subtract 200 pounds.\n3. Then from our last section, we took out the 50% of the meat from the salmon so we're left with two salmons.\n4. So now we have 200 - 50 = 150 pounds of meat from the salmon and then adding in the 150 to the previous weight he had.\n5. The rest of the meat from the forest that he had left came to 260 pounds which we add to the above.\n6. So our final is 356 pounds of meat from small animals.", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "11\n\n### Explain: \nIt is necessary to determine the amount of months that Jolyn is older than Leon according to this situation. \n\n#### Initial\n\nFirstly, we know that Jolyn is two months older than Therese. \n\nSecondly, we know that Therese is 5 month older than Aivo. We also know that Aivo is 2 month older than Leo. And additionally, the month Leo is born in is unknown. \n\nThirdly, we know that the sum of the month Jolyn is born in and the month Therese is born in is 7.\nAlso, the month Therese is two months older than Jolyn is 9. \n\nTo solve the problem, it is necessary to find out the month Leo is born. We know that Leo is five months old than Therese. If these five months are subtracted from 9, then the remainder is 4. Therese is two months younger than 4, and Therese is two months aged. Leo is then four months old, and it is the month he is born in. There is a possibility that his month is 6 and that he is five months younger than Jolyn. However, since Leo is two months older than Aivo, we know that Aivo cannot be 6 so Aivo cannot be two months younger than Leo. It turns out that the month he is born is 7.\n\n#### Solved\n\nIf Therese is three months older than Leon, and Leon is two months older than Leo, Jolyn is 11 months older than Leon.\n\nIf Therese was not three months older than Leon then Jolyn's difference from Leon at birth would be 13 (three + four [Jolyn is four months older than Leo] + one [Jolyn is one month older than Aivo]).

{"text": "D: 2 feet tall\n\n\n### Rationales: 1) Because we know that the sunflowers in Packet A were 4 feet tall, we can deduce that the sunflowers must be a minimum of two feet tall, since that is only half way to 4 feet.\n\n2) In question 19, which is a similar problem, we found that the sunflower from Packet A was 4 feet tall. This means that the sunflowers were at least two feet tall (1/2 of that height).\n\n3) Both answer choices are only 2 feet tall.\n\n### Detailed Rationale: Answer D is the correct choice because if the taller sunflowers in Pack A were 20 inches taller than the taller sunflower in Pack B, then Pack B sunflowers would be 2 feet tall. This answer makes sense because we have a 2 foot tall sunflower (pack B) and a 4 foot tall sunflower from Pack A. We then know that a 20% troll could take place, so the Pack A sunflower could be 2 + 4/2 feet and thus be Pack B's length. Pack B is 2 feet tall, meaning they are half that number. We know that the taller Pack A sunflower is 192 inches and that Pack B is 4 feet. This means that the Pack B sunflower is 2 feet tall.

For 42.5 apples a week, take the two weeks where he eats only one, 13.5 apples, and add that to 42.5, which equals 56 apples per week. Take that number times 7 which equals 385 apples total.

We're doing the last one with bleach, which counts as adding another wash cycle for the light load, so we add 20 gallons total of water to that one.

{"text": "In our scenario, it can be said that on average, Tank gathered 2.5 times as many eggs as Emma in the first round and 3 times as many in the second round. However, because each egg hunt only had enough eggs for each of the people to find 399, Tank's total of eggs (or their second round number) could not be the same as the one that  Emma collected in the second round. There must have been 89 eggs, a round number, left in the pile by the end of the egg hunt to make a total of 400 eggs in the pile. To figure out Tank's total in the second round, their number can only have been less than 89 or greater than 89 eggs. \n\nIf they could have collected fewer than 89 eggs, then there must have been enough eggs to fulfill Emma's second round egg count. This is not the case in our scenario, because Emma had a second round number to collect 60 eggs and could thus not have any eggs left in her second round to fulfill her original egg count. Therefore, their first round number has to be more than 89 + 60 to make a total of up to 400 eggs to explain why Emma's second round and Tank's total are not the same. If we multiply by 0.00001 then this sum becomes 8,900, or 1/80 + 1/60 + 30. This is because Emma collected 60 extra eggs on top of her own 60 eggs which means her second round count has to be half of Tank's first round count because 60 \u00d7 1 = 60, to make a total of to 400 which is half of 60 + 60. But to figure out what Tank's first egg count would be, we'll take the difference between what Emma collected in each round and subtract 60. For example, in the first round Emma can have collected 3 or less eggs than Tank which is possible if they each have collected 57 or more eggs and the difference is less than 60. The second round can also be calculated with the same method where their difference will be 3 or less but on the opposite side because Emma collected an extra 60", "answer": " 220"}

Ex: cumbersome, cumbersome, cumbulous. The prefix \"cum\" literally says to add or pack some additional stuff around. In this way, cumbersome means \"laborious and tedious\".\n\nAnswer: F.

Let's start by simplifying the wording above using a little imagination. \n  * On the first day of the voyage, the Skipper used a ship headed to a location 150 kilometers away from his starting point to travel due east, moving at 60km/h for 20 hours. This trip took him 250km from his starting point. To get to his destination, the Skipper would need to travel another 60km.\n  * After the 250km trip, the Skipper shut down the engines and allowed them to cool off to get ready for the second day of the voyage. \n    * During this time, the ship was blown back by the storm into a westward direction of 40 kilometers, a distance that was made because of the eastward distance traveled in the morning.\n  * After this time, the Skipper resumed his voyage, and traveled along a straight path again for 18 hours. If this trip ended in his same starting point, then this would mean that the total distance traveled from the first day's starting point to his second day of travel starting point was 2nd day travel starting point - starting point = 250km\n  * In the wording above, the Skipper is already halfway to his destination (150km) at the end of the first day's voyage.

{"text": "$1.50 each, Answer: $1.5 The small ones are less expensive than the large ones and Alison spends less for each small one.\n\n### Response 2: If the large tubs are $6 each, the large containers cost $6*1= $6. The small containers also need to cost an amount that makes $48 in a total. The number of the large containers are $6, add the number of small containers to the total cost of the large tubs in a total amount to be $48.\n$6+3+$0+$0+$1*6$= $48. Alison is spending $1.50 per container to make a total of $48, subtract $1.50 from $48 to equal $46.50.

Josh built a rectangular sandbox where the width was twice the length. It also has a perimeter of 30 feet (30 feet being the combined value of the length x the width of the sand box).\nThe width was twice the length, so it is 2(L) = 2xL;\nSo 30 = 2(L) means 2(L) + 2(L) also equals 30, which is why it becomes clear that 2xL = 2 and L = 2xL/2 = 2x1/2.

One boat can be placed at any point along a river where its width is at least 2+ feet. Therefore, it can fit within any given distance of the width.\n3. Hence, we count the distance starting from zero which is at most 2+ feet and it can repeat. So we count in increments of at least 2 and at most 3. So the count starts at 0, it goes up to 2+feet, then 4+, 6+, 8+ and so on. So the total number of boats that can race in the river is the square root of the number of the boats multiplied by 2+. \n\n4.

Choices: A: 12 B: 13 C: 14 D: 15 E: none of the above\nRationales: How old I would be if 1 year were 1 minute, 4 hours and 34 seconds would make me 11 years old. To figure this out, you would start by knowing your age. I assume that if the question were to say that the answer is 12, that would indicate my age. The age starts at 1, so subtract 1 from 12 and you get 11. From there, you can look at the time. 1 year is 5 hours, 37 seconds. However, when you turn 1, it is 0 minutes, 1 second. This would make me 10 years and 1 second old. If you add in 1 second, my age is 0 years and 0 second. You then subtract 1 from this, making my age 0 years and negative 1 seconds. To turn this into a positive, you have to add 1; -1 + 1 = 0. If you put in the time, the answer would be 9 in a single digit. To convert \"20 seconds\" into a single digit, you have to multiply it by 20. Then, you have to subtract 1 from the answer. After that, you add 1, just as you did for the single digits.

The exact location of the electrons around the nucleus is defined in terms of the electron configuration, with certain elements having larger gaps between their electrons and different arrangements.\n\nThe nucleons, or protons and neutrons, are the core of the atom and are positively charged. The negative charge of the electrons balance these positive charges and creates an overall neutral atom. Neutrons and protons have different effects on atomic mass, however, with neutrons having slightly higher mass which results in the sum of proton +1 neutron > proton.\n\nThough protons and neutrons are held by force in the atomic nucleus, electrons orbit at much greater distances from the nuclei. In fact, it is impossible for an electron orbital to be closer than about 0.16 nm (100 times less than the radius of a proton), which means it is impossible for an atom to have a \"one electron step\" away from the nucleus without collapsing upon itself.\n\nThe size of atoms varies across chemical elements, with the atom of hydrogen being smaller than most other elements, while there has been no evidence to suggest the atomic mass of", "answer": " 112"}

{"text": "Input: The solution is 12 pears, 40 oranges, and 20 apples. If you know that something is twice as large, you can figure out everything about it. This is the same as knowing the number of the object. Because the first number is twice as large than the second number, we know the number of the second number. Because we know the number of oranges, we know how many pears, times is the numbers because it's twice as many as the number of oranges.\n### Demonstareation:If 12 oranges equals 6 pears, than 1 pear equals 1/6 of an orange. Because 20 oranges equals 10 pears, the answer must be somewhere between 40 oranges and 20 pears. It appears to be 40 oranges. But wait, 10 pears equals ten to the third power, and 40 pears equals 2 times 40, or 80. What does twice 40 equal? 80 x 2 = 160\n\n### Additional hints: Let (x) be the total value of the number of pears and (y) be the value of the number of oranges of the quantity.\n\n### Solution: We know that the number of oranges is half the number of pears because one of every 5 oranges equals 3 of every pears and there are 20 oranges. Therefore, half of 20 times 3 will equal 10 times 3. The total number of fruits is the sum of half the number of pear times 3 and half the number of oranges times 3.\n\nThe total number of fruits: fruits = (\u00bd) x (3) x (20) + (\u00bd) x (2) x (20 + 20) = 60 fruits\n\nSince the numbers of fruits is an odd number of oranges, the fruits left must equal to 10\n\nThe number of oranges left = 50\n\nSince there's 20 apples and the number of pears minus the number of oranges equals the total number of fruits, which is 12 pear, 20 apples, and 40 oranges\n\nAnswer", "answer": " 44"}

{"text": "There were seventeen sailors in total, five of which are less experienced.\n```Based on what you know, calculate how much each person makes, if the inexperiences sailors made $10 per hour, for a 60 hour workweek```\n```In total then, how much do the experienced sailors make per month```\n\n### Rationales: There was a total of eighteen sailors in a ship and fifteen of those sailors we're less experienced and five of them we're more experienced. So the question is asking, if each member of the five experienced sailor makes on average 1/5 of the amount an experienced sailor makes. Then how is he making the rest of his money.\n\n### RATIONALES: The experienced sailors are paid $10/hr for a total of 260 hours, The experienced sailors make five times their payment. This is because if someone has more experience it takes them five times as long as someone who is less experienced. So there are in total, 1800-1500=300 hours a week, where the inexperiencing people work and the experiences one's only make up to three quarters of their payment.\n\n### In conclusion, the ship had 18 total sailors, 15 of those 18 sailors were working inexperienced. And five of those inexperienced were working as experienced.\n```The total value of the pay was $300 and therefore the amount paid was $10/hour. And when you multiply $10 by $300 you get 3000, so we multiply 3000 by 1/5 so then you would get $10. However this is where our mistake happens because we want to multiply 1/5 of 3000 and not 1/10, so it is 300 times 1/5 instead of 3 times 1/10 for the total pay for the month. But then you take those 300 paychecks and you multiply their worth by $10 and then the total paychecks are worth and added together worth $3000. \n\nBut that is not all there is to the pay.

The question does not contain any mention of weekly hours of operation, so it's unlikely that option A is correct. Also, the question does not contain any reference to a time interval. Consequently, it does not indicate that one should divide the total hours of operation by 7 to arrive at the weekly average. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to rule out option B because it is incorrect in the way it has been calculated.\n9. Similarly, choice C is a poor choice because it mentions \"week of hours\". The question may be referring to a day of the week, such as Monday or Friday, rather than a week of hours. Therefore, it would not make sense to divide the total hours of weekly operation by 10 to obtain a daily average. Therefore, this choice is incorrect and should be disregarded.\n10. Option D might be a reasonable choice since Monday is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the question. However, one possibility is that the answer could refer to a certain day of the week where it is open without an appointment every day.

{"text": "The correct answer is D: none. Ian has 13 roses remaining.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n### We first subtract the number of roses he gave to his relatives and the total number of roses he had at the beginning. Then, we know he has 13. If we subtract 6 from 20, we get 14. If we subtract 13 from 9, we get 4. If we subtract the number of rosestrue: 13from 13, we get 0. Hence, the total number of rosestruetrue: roses left is 12.\n\n### We now subtract 0 from 13. This gives us an answer of true: -13.\n\n### Finally, we can use true: 20-true: 12-true: 2-true: 0 to obtain true: false in base 2. This is because 20 > 13 > 12 > 2. Hence, Ian can't have any roses remaining because the 13 he subtracted is the largest number that isn't smaller than the remaining amount.\n\n### Here is another example to show how to find the correct answer.\n\n### InputThe price of the book is $20. If I pay with a $50 bill, how much do I have left?\n\n### Demostration\n\n### Input We subtract the price of the book(20) from the amount I am paying (50).\n\n### Demistaration \n\n### After subtracting the amount that I am paying from the price of the book, I have 30 left in base 2. \n\n### \n\n### This means that the correct answer is choice D: true: false because 0 is the largest number that is smaller than 30.\n\n### 0 is an even number so 30-0 gives even numbers left. Therefore, we know that the answer is D: true: false.\n\n### Output\n\n### It appears that option D: true: false is the correct answer.\nThe book costs $20, and you are using a $50 bill as payment.

Shelob has a weakness though, it has a fear of birds! When Shelob spots a bird flying across its lair, it jumps to catch the bird only for Frodo to attack Shelob with a stick. After Frodo hit Shelob with the stick, the spider was temporarily stunned and Frodo and Sam escaped to Mount Doom.\"\n\n### Rationale1. The question asks regarding a weakness that Shelob has.\n2. The description does not mention that the giant spider is afraid of birds, it just states that it is unlucky if it jumps to attack a bird flying toward it.\n3. Shelob is injured by Frodo which leads to its unfortunate death, but nothing is given to suggest that it was specifically due to a fear of birds. \n4. Frodo's attack with a stick is also possible, as birds are not the sole source of fear for the spider.\n5. After all, Shelob jumps to attack a flying bird while Frodo is present nearby- there is no reason for the action to be more related to a bird than any other potential factor.\n6. The conclusion is that Frodo's attack led more to the death of Shelob, and not due specifically to its fear of birds.", "answer": " 24"}

It's stated in the text that snakes are cold-blood animals (CBA's).\n2. If we take \"can't\" to mean \"do not\", it makes sense that \"can\" and \"do\" imply the opposite. By using the latter words, the author indicates that snakes are able to regulate their temperature.\n3. However, the question then asks us (inferentially) what the author meant by saying CBA's cannot regulate their temperature. By examining the evidence, we know that snakes are CBA's, but the answer now must be either 'do not regulate' or'some snakes can regulate'.\n4. By applying knowledge", "answer": " 42"}

Kingnook can only eat a maximum of 23 fish himself, so if Kingnook and Ittymangnarks ate half as many fish as their child, they would all have to feed at least 21 fish each.  If Ittymangnsk gave more fish, he himself could eat more.\n\n### If Ittymangnock and Kingnook are given a total of 42 fish to split up, they could each have 21 fish.   If Oomyapeck can eat 22 fish, he will be able to eat more than this amount.\n\n###  When considering what happens when Ittymangnook gives Oomyapeck 24 fish, then each of them would have to eat at least 13 fish.\n\n## Instructions:Answer the following grade level mathematics question.\nRationals: 1. The sentence uses irregular grammar which means the first clause is missing a relative phrase to the effect \"Who gave her that money\" or \"When someone gave her that money\".\n2. Then the question asks about the relationship between that and those which can be interpreted as belonging to the person or group to which Ms. Jackson is associated.\n\n### Question:  Ms. Jackson gave 5 students those $5.  How much money did she give to those students?\n\n### Rationales:\n1. For A: None of the students had the money.  That refers to Ms. Jackson \n2. For B: It's possible that the students were given money as part of a fundraiser because the question says Ms Jackson gave 5 students that so she could have given those $5 to each of the 5 students and then they could have given it to other students.\n\nAnswer: 1. A: Because none of them had the money before so they couldn't have given it away.  The people who gave the gift to the 5 students gave it to Ms Jackson and now her giving money", "answer": " 4"}

John asked the nearest neighbor if he could use his car until he got another. How far is John's street from the neighbor's?\n\n### Rationales: 1) It is evident from an earlier story that \nJohn's street ends at the corner of the neighbor's street. 2) If the neighbor agrees, then they must be willing to use the car.\n\n### Rationale: 2) It will not matter when the car breaks down. \n\n### Response : He is two houses away from his neighbor's.\nThe story so far is that John is walking down his street  when he sees a broken-down car at the corner of the next street, his neighbor's street. His neighbor is two houses away so, if he had a broken car, he would come home the same time he left and the car on John's street would be on his neighbor's street's corner.\n\n### Answer: E\n\n### Input-  Mary said that in the future she wanted to have a pet.

Choices: \tA: Montana B: New York C: Pennsylvania D: South Dakota E: Utah\nRationales:1. The question is inquiring about a state in which the name consists of one syllable when abbreviated. \n2. This excludes states with a state name consisting of two syllables, as the name and the abbreviation are typically not the same.\n3. Therefore, we must focus on states with the abbreviated version of their name having one syllable.\n4. Options A: Montana and E: Utah are the only states with the abbreviations being one syllable. \n5. However, Utah's name has 3 syllables, so it's ruled out as a possibility since the question requires a state with the same number of syllables in the abbreviation and the name.\n6.

If he walks to and from 3 times, that is 9 Hours.\n\nRoque' 2 hour bike ride to work and back is two times 2 which equals 4 hours. If he rides to and from work 2 times, that is 8 hours. So, Roque walks a total of 9 Hours, rides his bike 8 Hours, and bikes a total of 18 hours. However, if you add it all up, the total comes out to be 36 Hours.\n\nYou can see that 3 Hours didn't transfer, which means a mistake occured along the way, most likely in the transfer of 2 Hours. We know if the formula works without error. So, the missing 3 Hours comes from incorrect calculation somewhere else in the calculation. To know where, we can subtract the correct sum, 36 Hours from the total time(40 Hours), and get 4 Hours. Hence, 12 Hours were wrong. There are only two things that happened in the process, 3 Hours went missing, and 9 Hours went to the right. Hence 9-3= 6.

This means that Marvin sold 36 candy bars, and Tina sold 108 candy bars, because 108 > 35.\n\nBy multiplying 108 by 2, we get 216 dollars, which was the total amount of money made with the class trip fundraiser by Marvin and Tina. To find Tina's profit, divide 216 by 7, because every seven candy bars she sold resulted in a dollar (7 x $2 = $14).

It could equal 8 in number for every package. In the end, Angela will have 27 * 8 = 216 packages on her bike.\n\n### Discussion:\nWe must note that Angela delivered 27 things either as meals or package, we simply don't know. \nTo solve this problem we had to find a relation between packages and meals.

Incorrect response\n\n### Discrimination, Inaccuracy or Error, and Other Issues:\n\nOne issue is that the question asks how many meals do the 8 packages equal to while the answer is how many packages are 8 meals equal to. \n\nAnother is that the answer is not 32.\nIf in this answer, you replace the '8' with 16, you still get an answer 0, not 32. \nThis means if you get an answer that is not within two decimal places you have probably made an error.\n\n### Sample Solutions: \n\nThe reason why the question asks, 'If she needs to deliver 8 meals and 27 packages combined, how many packages does she deliver?' is wrong. \nBecause Angela doesn't need to deliver 8meals and 27packages, she only needs to deliver 2meals and 2packages combined.\n\n### Corrections: \n\nA possible modification is that Angela needs to deliver 2 meals and 2 packages together. \n\nThis modification fixes the question.

Then for Ariella, let X and Y represent the amount in her and Daniella's accounts respectively. Adding 0.10X to Ariella's account (the simple interest she pays) at the same rate for two years will make X+0.10X equal to X+2X = 2.10X. So the simple interest is added.

{"text": "Daniel spent $1640 on 266 games.\n### Instruction to the response:\nThe question asks how much Daniel has spent on all the games in this collection.\nGiven this, we first have to determine exactly what the question means by all. In other words, should our answer only count the price of the 266 games in the collection or should it include an additional cost for buying the collection itself?\nFor instance, suppose that Daniel paid $1,200 for a collection containing a specific set of games and then bought the games above and beyond the collection at no additional cost. In this scenario, the answer would be $1640 + 80*12 = $1,720. The total price that Daniel paid for the games in his collection is $1,940; in other words, he would have spent more than just the game's prices.\nOn the other hand, suppose that the cost of the collection was included in the $12 per game cost and that it was thus $12 for the collection + $80 for 80 games = $92. In this scenario, Daniel would have paid only $1,768, which is less than the total $1,942 that he would have paid if the costs of the 80 games were separate from the collection.\nBased on this, we are required to find the total cost of Daniel buying 266 games and the collection itself on top of that. This is because the question never states how many games Daniel bought with the extra money. Therefore, what we need to do is add up how much Daniel has spent using the price range that has not been specified (the range is between $3 and $12).\nFrom this line of reasoning, we can conclude that we would have to add up these two costs to find out how much Daniel paid.\n### Demonstrable example:The first step is to define the ranges and the total prices. This will tell us exactly where to focus:\n\n$3 + ($12 - $7) + $12 = $3 + ($5 - $2) = $6 + $3 = $9\n\n$7 + ($12 - 7) + $10 = $7 + ($5 - 2) = $12 + $10 = 22", "answer": " 2290"}

The question is inquiring about a house in a certain state, so we consider the phrase' the house is not quite finished' as a clue that provides information about the state.\n2. Once we understand the situation, the question becomes, what does the state mean?\n3. This implies that the state can be categorized into one of the possible answers, as an unknown number of possible states will be defined later, by the rest of the sentence.\n4. We will be looking for a word that can mean 'finished' or 'incomplete', so both options A & B will be ruled out.\n5. As far as 'unoccupied & liveable', a house that is not occupied does not necessarily need to be lived in for it to be considered 'liveable', so these two are irrelevant.\n6. The phrase in the parentheses indicates some sort of condition, so the possible answers are C: unoccupied & D: liveable.\n7. A house is not quite finished because there are certain 'unoccupied' or 'liveable' states.\n8. Thus, the correct answer is E: comfortable.

{"text": "64 inches\n\n### Rationale:To find the average height, we must first know that Parker is 4 inches shorter and Daisy is 4 inches taller than Reise. Next, we will subtract the taller height from the shorter height, and add it together to find the average.\n\nSo, Parker is 4 inches tighter than Reese. Thus, Parker's height is 60-4=56. Daisy is four inches taller than Reishe so Daisy's height is 74-4=70. \n\nNow, we will subtract 70 from 74 to get 4. Similarly, we will take away 56 from 60 to get 4. The add the two sums, which is 9 to 4+4 to get 9+4=13. \n\nSo, the average height is 60 inches + 6 inches = 66 inches.\n\nLet's try our second challenge!\n\n### Instructions: The train ride across the country was supposed to be relaxing, but Joe kept getting annoyed by the passengers behind him.

If we look at the equation we want to find, we will see that in the total bill they have given us, we've been asked to find 20(g) and 9(g).\n \n2. Let's break this down and start with the 20(g). They want you to find 20% of your total bill. If we substitute in our known numbers for the total, sales tax and the tip amount, we will get the following: 20(g)=0.20*140=28 This means that we want to find 28.\n \n3. For the other 9, we will do the same steps, this time replacing our numbers to equal 9%, which is equal to 10%-1% (sales tax). 9(g)=0.09*140=12.6\n\n### Solution:\n1. We can start with the 28 and add it to 1260 to get 1288.\n\n2. We can further simplify this a bit by adding the $10 and the $80 and now we just have $122\n\n### Explanation:\n1.

Since the question asks about the man's survival, this seems to be a time when he may not be well-nourished.\n3. The choice of \"food\" is unlikely.

The choice of \"fake news\" is also weak since this is an item he will need to survive and not to survive.\n\n5.

If Kevin places his laptop and work papers into his briefcase, and his briefcase is twice as heavy as Karen\u2019s brief case, the weight of Karen tote must be greater than 8 pounds. If Kevin's brief case has a weight of 8 pounds, then the weight of the remaining contents of the briefcase are at least 8 pounds.

When a man instructs a woman to help him, he may not immediately know how to proceed. Therefore, the two would need to speak after the task is finished in order to discuss what they should help each other to do.\n2. Let's analyze the answer choices. Option A says that a shoelace is needed, but it is not necessary for the man to tie his shoes. He could use a stool or a pen, for example.\n3. Option D: \"a scissor\" also does not fit. After tying her shoe, the woman may not want the man to cut the shoelace too quickly. She may prefer a stool or a shoelace, etc.\n4. Options B: a stool and E: Both are both possible because although the stools themselves may not be essential to help the man, they could be used to help him if he wanted to sit in order to properly tie his shoes.\n5.

{"text": "Choice D)\n\n### Rationales:\nChoice C is incorrect because we're told that Bryan spends \"half that time\" on advertisement posts - not more than. Half of half a day's time would be a quarter of a day's time. Therefore, it is not possible for Bryan to spend more time on advertising posts than he does customer outreach posts, because if he spends half a day's worth of time on one activity, then he could not possibly spend more than half a day's actual worth of time on another activity.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because we've been given a formula that relates the total number of hours Bryan spends on activity A to the hours he spends on activity B. For example, if we substitute in \"marketing posts\" for \"A\" and \"customer outreach posts\" for \"B\", we get this:\n\n```\n 8x/2x =.5\n 8 x 1 = 8/4/2 = 2\n```\n\nAs is explained later, we're looking for an answer where we divide, not multiply.\n\nChoice E is incorrect because of a logical blunder that occurs when someone writes this equation incorrectly. Here, a person would subtract.5's on the left side (advertisement posts) from.5's on each side (marketing vs. customer outreach), instead of multiplying them.

{"text": "Tanya bought 3 plums.\n\n### Rationale: The question does not specify how many pieces of fruit were in the bag, so we can assume that all types of fruit are equally represented, 4 Granny \nApples, 2 pears, 3 plums, and 12 pineapples. If you were to count the fruit you would find that 4 Granny Smith Apples, 2 pines and 6 pears are still left in the bag. Since the bag had a hole in it, half of the fruit spilled out. However the bag had a total of 12 pears, which we know will leave at most 6 pears left in the bag because of the hole. The other 2 things left in the bag will only be apples or pineapples. Since both of these things have a total of 2 in the bag, then it must be a apple and a pear. So if 12 pears are in the bag (11 more than there are plums in the bag) it must be a pear and an apple, making the answer 3 plums. Another way of doing this is seeing how many things can possibly be in the bag with the holes for the fruit. There could be 4 apples, 3 pear, a bunch of fruit, 2 apples, and then it is impossible. If the fruit was a bunch of fruit, the bag would have at least 4 pears, and a bunch would have more than 10 pears in it. If there are 4 apples in the bag, it has been ruled out because there can at most be 3 apples in the bag. If there are 3 apples in there, you have a pear, an apple, and a bunch together. If there is some fruit you can just do the same thing as with 3 apples and the bag will have a bunch of fruit in it. So there only is a bunch of fruit left in the 4 of the 6 pads possible. So there has to be an Apple, a pear, and a bunch of fruit. Since there was 6 pears in the bag, then there must a apple there now, and there must be a bunch of fruit remaining. This results in no plums and 3 plums. That is why the answer is 3 plums.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "The total number of books in the classroom after the teacher brought the extra eight books is 25.\n\n### Justification: In the initial set of 10 children in the classroom, each child had 7 books. The total number of books the children had was 7 times 10 or 70 books.\nNext, the teacher brought additional books to the classroom, which brings the total number of books in classroom to 70 + 8 or 78 books.\nThinking about the initial set of 70 books, we can estimate what each child had. Since each child had the same amount of books, each classroom would have 3.5 books each child. This means we can calculate the total number of children by counting the number of classes. There are 3.5 books per class plus the total number of books the teacher brought, which gives us a total of 10.5.\nNext, we plug this into our equation:\n\n70 books * (10 children /5 classes) + 8 books = 45 books * (10/.5) = 80 books + 8 books = ___ books\n\nThe initial classroom had 70 books.

{"text": "The answer is C: 2min 24secs. Here's why:\nThe advertising takes up all the time between the news and information segments. There are no advertising breaks (no commercials) during the news segments. The weather reports come before the advertisements (you can't advertise without there being something to advertise), so there are 2 minutes of advertising. Then there are 4 advertising segments, so there are 4 * 30secs/segment = 120secs worth of advertising. The rest 24secs comes from the final ad block.\n\n### Input : The half-hour newscasts includes 12 minutes on national news, 5 minute on international news, 5 minute sports and 2 minute of weather forecast The rest is advertisement's. How many minutes of ads are in the newscasts?\n\n### Instructions: Answer\n\n\nAn advertisement is a call for sale. It is a message, usually paid for, that attempts to sell a product, or influence consumers to think about a product in a positive way. A TV commercial or radio ad are the most obvious example of an ad, but there can also be newspaper, billboard or other types of advertising as well. In my opinion, this particular question is referring to an ad block (a segment between news segments with no news in it, no not the part of the news dedicated to ads). \n\nFirst, there is nothing that can advertise without something to advertise, so the ad block cannot come before the news segments. The sports portion of the program will be broadcast after the news, and the weather segments always come before the news. The only time there will be an ad block before the news is after the weather forecast. This means that the advertisements are in the following slots: Between the first 2 news segments and the weather forecast (4 slots), the ad block before the sports broadcast (1 slot), and the final ad block before the closing credits (1 slot).\n\nThe total number of ads in the news broadcast can be calculated using the formula length of ad slot * number of slots. In the context of the news it is the time between two news segments. So, for the news segments it will be 12 min. * 4 = 48 min", "answer": " 6"}

If option D is true, this implies that there exists a value that is between 0.78 and 78, since 0.78 is greater than 0.2 and 78 is greater than less than 0.\n6. Therefore, there are many potential values of 0.78%, which would still be more than 0.03% of whatever value we choose in Option D. Thus, choice D is incorrect.\n7. Similarly, Option A is also incorrect because if Option D is true, it is possible that no value between 0.05001 and 0.15001 represents the value greater than 0.02252 than would be smaller than 78% and about as big as 0.02. The problem we're facing with all these questions is that we're allowed to pick any values, so our reasoning can't be accurate because if we had used different values we could have got a different answer. However, this doesn't make sense, because a percentage is a constant value that cannot change to whatever value the person wants. This is why we can simply pick any value, like 2. This is also known as a \"No True Scotsman\" argument, where someone claims a point will remain true, but if you test their claim and the statement is incorrect, the person claims that whatever you tested is not a true example. In this case, we will not disregard any values, but instead show that if we do pick values they will always produce the original value.\n8. Next, let's look at Option A:", "answer": " 2,250"}
{"text": "If Mark uses half of his sick days in a year, there are 10 sick days total. That leaves 5 remaining. Then, if Mark uses half of his vacation days, there are 12.5 total vacation days.

The situation described is likely the Titanic crossing the Atlantic Ocean from England to America, a trip that lasted about 3.5 days.\n2. One way this would be relevant to the event is if the Titanic had to stop to pick up passengers or drop off supplies. Alternatively, it may have made impacts or course changes along the way.\n3. None of choices A through D have much to do with the time lapse since the departure, so we can rule out those options.\n4. Choices B and E have a chance of corresponding to this situation, but choice B is better because passengers could be dropped off at different stops along the way, where choice E would only consider the final destination.\n5. Choice C, course change, could be relevant if the ship encountered unfavorable weather or water conditions (or course change for other reasons) that necessitated a change in direction or path.\n6.

Making 0.05 (5%). 0.16 (10%). 0.125 (12.5%). And 0.25 (25%):\n5% = 0.05 \n10% = 0.1 \n10% - 10% = 10% (0.16 - 0.1) = 0 \n12.5% = 0.125 \n25% = 25% = 0 \n2. Now there are three steps to take with this problem. First we subtract 100. Subtract the denominator and the numerator. Next we multiply by 100: 5% = 0%. 10% = %. 12.5% * 2 = 25%. 16% * 2 = %. Third, we multiply by 1/100 : 5% * 100 = 5%. 10% * 10/100 = 10/1% = 10%. 12.5 % * 10/2 = 12.5 / 2% = 6.25%.", "answer": " 25"}

The question asks, \"if he earns $45, how many apples does his trees give to him?\" The apples can be thought of as earned money and the total would represent the profit received from selling the apples. So the number of apples must be equivalent to $45.\n2. Looking at answer options E, $75, it's the best answer. The question doesn't ask for the total number of all apples; it only mentions the total number of all sweet apples. The apples that are sold are sweet, which has to have 3/4th of the total apples.

The answer to this is coins + cash = 10. \n3. Because $20 is 200% of $10 which means that 100 coins + cash will be dispensed after someone pays $9 using two $50 bils.\n4. This means that we start with 100 coine if we pay the entire 9 using mixed set of coins and 100 coines we do not have to pay the full amount so let us say we are left with 50 coine and we have 2$ of cash and that means that we have to pay 0.1*50 and so that is 1 and we are left with 49 coines and we have 2 $ of cash so we do not have to worry about that.\n5. Now if we are asked about when is cash is dispensed then it means that it is from the total and in this problem 9 is the total and so we have to multiply 9 by 0.1 and that will give us cash.\n6.

He pays the lowest the most\n2. Next, he pays the highest $100.\n3. After he completes the job he pays the lowest the amount he would pay the highest if there were no second best.\n4.

We are trying to create the scenario where the lowest earns the most, the highest earns the second most, and we are able to maximize profit.\n2. Option C - $130: If option C = $130 then the electrician that made the 2nd highest will also earn $130 and we can't give them more than the lowest because the lowest must earn highest possible amount.

{"text": "There are 15 chocolate + vanilla chips.\n\n### Rationale:We know that Viviana has five more chips than Susana and that Susana has 3:4 as many as Viviana does. \n\nSince Viviana has 2 chips and has 5 more than Susana, this means she has (5+2) = 7 total chocolate chips. Similarly, since Susana has 4 as many chips as Viviana, she has 3 x 4 = 12 total chocolate chpis. \n\nTherefore, the total number of both chocolate and vanilla chips Viviana and Susana have is the sum of both these numbers: (7+12) = 19. \n\nSince we know that there should be 15 chocolates + 15 vanillas total, this means we have 5 vanillas that were not calculated above. After counting both chocolates and vanillas, we end up with a total number of 30 chips.\n\nHence, the solution here is that Viviana and Susana together have 15 chocols + 15 vanilla = 30 total choclates + vanilla chips, which is (5+15)/3 = 10.\n\n### Input\"Which two planets were once part of the same solar system?

Choices: 1: small 2: big 3: little 4: huge 5: normal\nRationales: When it comes small tanks: small, little, and tiny are used interchangeably. Normal would not make sense in context. So that leaves big and huge. It is not specified that the size of the tank is a big one or a huge one, only that it is bigger than small. Because of that, we can eliminate huge as an option that is an exaggeration of small and therefore not feasible. \n\nInput: It was easy to spot Mr. Rogers behind the curtain, because?

A Tuxedo is an easy way to identify that it's Mr. Rogers behind that curtain. The mustache is a bit harder to spot, but is also easy to identify. A tall, thin man isn't an easy way to identify Mr. Rogers, because that would identify any person behind the curtain.

What percentage of students do not read at least once a week?\n\n### Deduction:\n### The question is asking for the percentage of students who do not read at least one time a week given a certain percentage of students who read at least one time per month.\n### The total number of students can be found to be 125, and we then need to take the percentage of students who read more than once a month. The percentage was originally represented by the equation \"45/125\" or 1/3rd, which translates to 33% of students who know where their school library.\n### This means that 33% of the students read at least once a months. The percentage of students who don't read at least one time is then reached by subtracting this percentage or 33% from 100%. 100%-33%=67%. The percentage of students who do NOT read at least one time each week is then found from this information. Subtracting 1/3 and then rounding will then yield the answer of 67%. This number represents the percentage of students who DON\"T read at least one time every week, which is 3 in 5.\n### Rationales:\n### We were given two pieces of information, and asked to find a certain percentage of students in the school.\n### If a percentage of students read regularly in the school, what percentage of students do not know where the school library is or read regularly?\n### The equation can be written as \"33/125=33%\" and to find the percentage of students who donot read regularly, we subtract 33% from one hundred like so: 100% - 33% = 67%.\n### This 67% is found to be the percentage of students in the class who do NOT regularly read texts.

{"text": "the answer to your question is b, twenty eight. \n### Rationale:\n1. The first thing we should notice is that the question asks how many spokes a certain bicycle has so the number will be non-negative.\n2. Secondly, the front wheel and the back wheel must each have different numbers of spokes, as otherwise we would simply have two wheels with the same number of spokes, a disqualifier. \n3. The front wheel and back wheel each have at least two spokes, since there are more than none. \n4. The front wheel has at least five spokes, since there is at least one wheel with four spokes. \n5. The front wheel has twelve spokes, since there have to be at least twelve total spokes for each. \n6. The back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel. That is, let's call the number of spokes on the front N, so Twice as many spokes = 2N.  \n7. The back wheel has 24 spokes, since (2N)=24 since N=12\n8. Since the back wheel has 2N=24, N=12. \n9. The front wheel has N=12 spokes and at least one wheel has (12/4)=3.\n10. The total number of spokes is: front wheel * (at least one more than one) + back wheel * (twice as many on the back as on the front)\n11. We get: N * (1+2) + 24 * 2\n12.

A: ice box B: stove C: refrigerator D: dishwasher E: radio F: electricity \n2. Explanation  A: ice box Ice boxes were an old-fashioned refrigerator. An ice box contained an insulated compartment where ice and other ice-making materials were kept. When the ice melted, the contents inside remained cool due to the insulating properties of the box. The ice box was a common refrigeration method used in the early 20th century until the invention of the modern refrigerator in the mid-1900s.  B: stove An open-flame cooktop known as a stove was commonly used to prepare food in kitchens in the 1930's and 1940's. It was not uncommon for a stove to be the sole cooking appliance in a kitchen, as electric and gas stoves were becoming increasingly common at this time.\n3. Considering option C: refrigerated, a refrigerator can be a cool box that keeps food fresh, but this is not always true as there are many types of refrigerators.

{"text": "Paul runs 11.5 miles, or 90 minutes of watch time.\n\n### Support 1:\nWhile Paul watches two movies that are an average of 1.5 hrs each, he runs a mile in 10 minutes. He therefore runs two miles or 120 minutes.\n\nWhile Paul watch movies, he runs 10 miles, or 80 minutes of watch time, in total.  12 minutes for one mile x 2 movies + 10 minutes for 2 miles = 12 minutes per movie + 10 minutes per mile x 2 miles = 22 minutes.\n\n### Proof 1:\nTwo movies are watched in total so Paul runs a total of 22 minutes x 2 movies/total movies = 44 minutes. This results in 88 minutes of watch time minus 44 minutes of run time, leaving 44 minutes of watch time remaining.\nHowever, Paul ran 10 miles so 10 miles + 44 minutes = 11.44 miles. Adding together 10 miles and 4.43 miles, we get 11.43 miles after which we round to the nearest integer, 11.5miles.\n\n### Output:\nPaul runs 0.5 miles per movie and he watches a total of 1.5 movies, resulting in 150 minutes. He therefore watches movies for 150 * 0.5 = 75 minutes. Paul runs a mile in 0:12 minutes, so he therefore runs 0.544 miles in total or 18.17 minutes. \n\nPaul watches 2.475 movies and he runs 8.17 miles or approximately 8.2 miles, which are about 128 minutes.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 for all the tickets.\n\n### Justification:The cost of the tickets is given by the following equation: (price of 1 ticket)*(number of tickets), where price of 1 ticket is 40, and number of tickets is 12. Multiplying both sides by 10 to get rid of the tenths, we get (4)*(10), which equals 40 as well. Now, dividing the 5 by 10, which will give us (5/10)*4 = 2.

{"text": "He spends $250 on coursework materials.\n\n### Justification:\nInput: James is a first-year college student in Chicago with a budget of $1,000 per semseter. He spends 40% of his money (30% of his first year budget) on food and drink and 10% of his budget on transportation. How many dollars does he have left to spend?\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The student has $1,001 left to spend. This statement is logical because he spends 40 percent of his first-year budget (30 percent x $1,00) on food and drink, another 10 percent on transportation, 30 percent on all of the remaining things, which adds up to 40 percent, and he spends the remaining 10 percent.\n2. This calculation is straightforward and logical because the student has not yet taken all of his coursework classes, given that he is just starting college in the fall. Thus, there must be some money left over to spend after he has bought everything else. The question asks for the remainder of the money, which is exactly $1,00.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. The question asks the amount that James spends on coursework materials. James spends $25.\n2. He uses $250 on food and drink and the rest on course materials, for a total spent of $400.\n3. We can subtract $400 from a total that represents all of James' expenses, leaving $600. However, this does not equal what James spend on course materials.\n4. This is not a result that seems possible when we think about how James might spend his money. In fact, $250 on materials doesn't seem like a realistic spending option.\n5. In fact, if James used only 30 percent of his per semseter budget for coursework, he wouldn't have enough materials to spend $25 for, which means the question is wrong because the math makes no sense.\n\n### The answer to the question, then, is that James does not spend 30 percent of the money he has for course materials.\n\n## Write an instructional paragraph.\n\n### Use the following steps to develop the paragraph:", "answer": " 300"}

Elsa's third of what she has = Elsa's first three of her four times the value of what she has - 3(10/45)/10 = 3/4. Let's write the total of the coins Elsa and  Amalie have in a ratio form: Elsa's copper coins:Amili's copper coints = 10:49. Now Elsa's cooper coins (which is always higher than Amalie's) will equal to the total  amount (440 copper coins) since it has twice as many copper coins as Amaliel. 10 cooper coins (out of 20) = 1/2 = 50%. Now if Amalie has one fourth of her coins then Amalie's first fourth of her copper coins = 14 (14/40). So Elsa's remaining copper coins (which are double) = (20 + 14) = 34. Then if Amaliel has 34 copper coins to Elsa's 45 copper coins then she has 34/(10/45) = 140 copper coints. This is true because Amalie's fourth of what she has = 14 (out of 440) and then the answer 140 cooper coins. Amaliel's fourth = 440 - (elvis' 45/10) = 14 (440 + 145).

{"text": "He paid 139$\n\n### Justification: We need to find quantity x which is 4 times itself such that 4x=139\n\n### Rationale: 1. The problem states that James bought five 4-pound packs of beef, each with a price of 5.5 per pound.\n2. From the given information, I can derive that James bought 5 packs of 4-pound beef for a total of 136 pounds.\n3. We will assume that \"each\" in the problem means that James bought one of each type of pack of beef, which would make each pack 4 pounds.\n4. This means that \"4\" represents how many times each type of pack was bought, so 4x equals the total amount paid.\n5. We can express this as 4x = 139, where the expression can be simplified to be x=4*139/x\n6. We can then insert x=139 in the expression we just formed, which becomes 4=139/x, and then solve for x (x x) x-139/x = x = 4\n 7. Hence, the total cost was 139, which represents 4 times itself.\n\n\n### Input James bought 2 bounty brands of tissue 8packs each How many packs or rolls  did he buy with the price of 445.99\n\n### Response :He bought (72) rolls  or packs\n### Justification\n### Rationale 1.

After all, parties typically do not serve a large quantity of glasses. And even if drink glasses were used in a large measure, they would be broken at a rate of one broken per person, not per number of drinks served. Hence, David did not break anywhere close to 13 glasses, so option B cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption C:\nWilliam broke \"4 times\" as many glasses as David. From this, we can surmise that David broke half as many glasses as William, i.e. around 6 glasses.

Choices: A: stay in position B: stand C: go to sleep D: sit idle E: stand up\nRationales: Input tells us that choices A through E are all possible. These represent various things or places that you might do.\n1. A person is \"beginning work\", which implies that they are at the start of a work process.\n2. The work process could be some sort of task or job that a person is beginning to do. It doesn't necessarily have to be physical.\n3. When a person is \"beginning\" anything or starting a process, it's likely that they're starting to prepare first by getting ready for it.\n4. So, for choice A: \"stand in position\", this would only occur if the beginning work was some sort of physical movement or task that you might do. In other words, this choice would only make sense if the answer is \"standing\".\n\n#### Analysis:\n\n5. As for choice B: \"stand\", this word can be used as a verb or a pronoun.\n6. The meaning of choice B: \"go to sleep\", is ambiguous here because it can mean many things like \"shutting down\" or \"stopping\".\n7. As for choice C: \"sit idle\", this doesn't make much sense. This choice assumes you have no other things to do and don't do anything other than \"sit idle\" until you're told to stop.

{"text": "Herbert will be (24 \u2013 10) or 14 years old next year\n\n### Instructions:Write a response that appropriately answers the questions.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question asks what is the answer for the age that Herbert will be next year. Since Herbert is 10 years _younger_ than Kris, this means that Kris is 10 years older than Herbert. Let's write that as *Kris - Herbert = 10* years.\n\nAlso, note that the question states that Kris is 2 years old _now_, meaning the year is not relevant. \n\nIf Kris is 2*years of age, Herbert's next year's must be 8*years younger than Kris's. Let's write this as *Kris + Herbert = 8* years older than Kris.\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation yields *Kris - Herbert \u2261 10* years and *Kris + Herbert \u2261 8* years. We can subtract the first equation from the second and simplify. 30 - 10 = 20 and 30 + 8 = 38. Divide both sides by *30*, giving *2 \u2261 2.833...* We can simplify further by multiplying both sides by 2, giving *2 \u22612* and simplifying to 1. We'll see this again.

With their fourth child, that too would be the case in the leap year of February 29, 2008.

Each lb. (of coffee), 3lb., is equal to to 13 cups of coffee. After we know that each of the 3 lbs. is equal to 13 cuis, we can say that \"Angie buys 3 lbs. (of coffee) so that each day, she will drink 13 cups (=3 lbs divided by 25 days) of coffee, for a total of 39 cups of coffee\"\n\n**Demonstation Rationale**:\nWe know Angie bought 3 lbl. of coffee. Since we know Angie drinks about 3 cups of each lb. of coffee with a total of 3 lbl, this means she drinks 9-10 cups of coffee each day.\n\nAfter this, we take all these facts and use them to get an answer. With this equation... \n13 cuis = lb. = 1/40 cuis = 13/25 days.\n\n**Reframing Demonstration Input**: Angie bought 3lbs. of coffee.\n\n**Reframe: \"3 lbs of coffee\" is equal to \"1 lb of coffee brewing 40 cups\"**\n\n**Demonstraion: For instance, the answer 3 lb. can be broken down into 3 lbs (=lb)(3 lb. divided by 25)= 0.75 lb, and 40 cups can be broken down into cuis (3 x 40 = cuis)\n\n**Reframed input:** She bought 3 lb.

Then, Matt uses it for 16000 seconds, or ~39 seconds at its lowest setting, and he uses it for 22.89 seconds at its highest setting \n\n### Demanded Answer: To determine the total vibrations, simply sum two numbers - 1600*1600 for the lowest setting, and 1661*22.89 (1661/100 x 22.8) for the highest setting. This comes to 2,965,940 vibrations total for a 5 minute usage of 1600 setting, and 3,402,750 vibrations total using the 1661 setting for 5 minutes.

{"text": "Tom will need 19 + 4/5 of 19 pieces of rope to buy. \n\n### Justification:Tom will need to lash 20 pieces of rope together.   In order to get the rope down to a desired length, we must find how long the rope will need to be if you lash it together.   In this problem, we are told to lash 2 pieces of rope together to get 10 feet. However, if we lash 20 items together to get 20 feet we will lose 21/20 * 20 feet, or 41/40 feet and thus the rope will not be 20 feet long.  In order to get this, we must cut off 5/4 feet.  Now, we must take the total of 19 pieces from the 20 foot rope, and lash them together to get our desired rope down.  1 20/20 = 1, but when you lose that 5/4 you must add 1/4 and lash together.   Then you subtract how many feet you lose when doing this.  This is done by dividing the pieces of rope you would have by the 6 stories you need to go down to make it come out to be 10 feet.  3 * 11/4 = 35/4. We are making 20 feet, so subtracting these pieces will give us back 6.  35-6 = 39/4. The 3 from the 3 * should only become 1 because we now have 20 ropes that are 10 feet each, and only 20 * 1 will be 20.  If it was 30 you would need an additional 1 piece of rope to make it an even number.  39/4 =.975 = 4/5.  Now we must find 19 + 1/.5.  4/5 + 2 = 6/5 = 11/5 so the answer is 11 + 19.

{"text": "Answers are all options A, B, C, and D\n\n### Input and rationales:\n\n1. The question is concerned with the depth of a river throughout the month of July, and asks us to convert a range of numbers to a final depth. \n2. We're asked to start from the date of mid-June in May, as this is when the depth is five feet deep.\n3. It is also established that this depth is less than the depth by mid-June by two months. Let's examine the two months that come in between the start and the end of the year in July. \n4. The river starts out at a depth of five feet in May. By June, its depth increased by three feet.\n5. From the month of June, the depth continues to grow by three feet each month, which would be the third month. This is why the month of July has been picked.\n6. Now, we have to determine the depth by July. We can find the difference in depth between the two by subtracting each month. \n7. For mid-May, the depth is five feet. Mid-June becomes 10 feet, which is obtained by subtracting the June depth, which is 5 feet, from the May depth, which is 10 feet. \n8. For mid-June, we subtract the mid-May depth and obtain 5 feet.\n9. We repeat this step for mid-July. We start at the depth of mid-June, which is 15 feet, and subtract 5 feet to get 10 feet. Hence, the depth in mid-July is 10 feet using the numbers from mid-June. \n10. The key conclusion is from this process that we add three feet each month and subtract the months in between from the starting point. If we follow this process, we can find the depth of the river at mid-July. \n11. For mid-July, we take away the June depth and get 5 feet. \n12. 5 feet + 3 feet becomes 8 feet.\n13.

The question asks when would it make sense to take the test earlier rather than later.\n\n2. Let's analyze the choices:\n\n- A. The question says \"if no one can get in,\" so this choice is irrelevant because the situation doesn't involve not getting in.\n\n- B. This choice could potentially be a better time because if you take a test before 8pm then you could get in earlier. However, \"no one gets in\" doesn't make sense, so we can rule this out.\n\n- C. The other time where 8pm would make sense is if the game wasn't getting done because you never can do well in an impossible game.\n\n- D. This choice doesn't make sense as you would be taking the test late at night. This isn't the ideal time for a test.\n\n- E. This choice might sound like it could be reasonable, but you also cannot get in at 8pm, which is the opposite of \"no one can get in.\"\n\n- F.

The money he makes for each neighbor\u2019s yard can then be seen as one hour x the amount they pay per yard. This is just like a business transaction, where they pay Joey $8 for each yard (the higher number) so they only pay $80 in total for him to do their lawns.

To find out how much he has to pay, take your total earnings and subtract the price of the pair. Then take your total and subtract the price of your next choice. If you still have a positive number, subtract that value by your next choice value. The process repeats until you add your choice value and the value you subtract keeps on decreasing (usually). In Joey\u2019s case, he has a total of $120. If he subtracts his next option (sell 2 collectible figures for each each $9 each), he would be left with $72. Then if he subtracted the next option, he would have $56. Then if he did the same as the previous one, he would have $23. Then if he did it again, he would have $4.

But she does not want to pay in cash rather she wanted a credit facility to pay the full amount.\n\nConsidering that she has $500 in her hands now Mrs. Smith wants to avail two-fifthths more money than 500$ which she has. So she goes to a shop to buy three item such that the cost of three items is equal to her 500$ and she also has the facility to pay within 15 days at the least.\n\nAfter going to shop and trying out items costing 450$ Mrs. Smith left with one 450$ item plus 15 days credit facility for the rest of 50$ for a total of 600$.\n\nNow Mrs. Smith is left with a balance of 150$ which she can only use in 15 days. According to the question statement Mrs. Smith is left of an additional 150$ in a total of 15 days, so she has two options :\n\nOption A: Pay full (500$ in 15 days) in 15 days and the 150$ she left will be wasted in such case.\n\nOption B: She can postpone payment of 150 $ which she had to pay and still pay the rest of 5$ in 15 more days to close the deal.\n\nHence Mrs. Smith can use the money she has for an additional 15 days and only when she will pay will she get the benefit of 15% discount.\n\nThe question states that the additional 2/5 required amount is of 5000$ which means 4500$ worth 400$ and 1500$ which means around 500$.\nHence by subtracting 2/5*5000$ from Mrs.Smith's total balance she will come to an amount which will be equal to the addition of 37500 which means at last Mrs. Smith needs 3750$.", "answer": " 95"}
{"text": "<img align=\"right\" alt=\"img1.png\" border=\"0\" src=\"img1.png\"/>\n\n### Analysis:\nThe first step of the answer is to use the given information to find the number of judges <b>under 30</b> years old.\n* 10% of 40 = 4\n* There are 60 judges in the range 30-59 years old. This group should be divided into 40%. Therefore, under 30 years of age judges = <b>4 + 4*30%</b>\n\n<img align=left alt=\"img2.png\" border=0 src=\"img2.png\"/>\n\nThen the remaining judges are divided into 60 to find how many are over 50.\n\n* 40% = under 50 years old\n* 40 + 6 + 6*40 = 56\n\nSo the number of judges older than 50 is 56.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe solution to this question consists of multiple steps. Although it seems obvious what information is required, some steps are more hidden than others. As such, it is important to note which of the provided information is necessary for the solution.\n\n* <b>Under 30</b>: The question clearly states that there are 10% of judges younger than 30 years old, but only 10% has to be taken of the 40 total judges.\n\n* <u>30-50</u>: The question states that 60% of judges are between 30 and 50 years of age.

Now, if all the information is given in the question, which is 5 cents of profits, then the per package profits can be calculated as following, 5 cents of per package profit x 10,0 of packages per day = then, is 50 cents per day profit, which is 350 cents per week.\n\n**Detailed:** In calculating the profits of a distribution center,the number of packages that is processed is an important factor in the calculation. In this question, Gary manages two distribution centers, one which processes 10, 000 packages per d,and other 30,000 packages per a day. If the profit is 5 cents per package, then the profit for each distribution center can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages per day which means, per package profit of $5 per day x 10, 1000 (original) = $350,000 per week, while second distribution center (30,00 per day), then per package profit is $5 x 30,0 000 = $ 150,00 per week.

{"text": "A: 1\n\n### Justification:\nThe box's dimensions are 8 x 10 x 12. There are no dimensions for the length of a building block. We can assume the dimension of a \"long\" side of the building block is similar to the dimension of a side of the box. Also, a building block fits inside the box (since we cannot fit more than 1 into the box if at least 1 is able to fit). Therefore, 1 of the sides of these blocks would need to meet with a side of the box's dimensions. According to the dimensions given, the 3 inch side would not fit but either 2 or 4 inches would. Since 3 inches is less than 12 inches, the 3 inched side would not fit in the box. Only 2 and 4 inched sides of the building block can fit. The difference between the width and length of a building block is 2 inches. Therefore 8 (for the width of the box) - 2 (for the width of a building block with 2 inches of the length fitted in) = 6. 12 (for the length of the box) - (2 and 4) (for the building blocks with 2 and 4 inches respectively of the length fitted in in the box) = 8. Therefore, the building blocks that can fit are: 1. 1 wooden block with 3\" side/10\" side. 2. 3 wooden blocks with 2\" side/10 side. 3. 5 wooden blocks with 2\"/4\" side. 4. 8 wooden blocks with 2/8\" side.

Now, 16 equals 10/5, which is half, and half is 10. Then we subtract one-half, we get 10 and then 16 minus 10 is 6, which makes the difference between Sabrina's total and what she had left with her. The three equalities are 20 equals to 6(1/2)+[2/3+1/5] Sabrina had to give 2 of her cookies to her siblings. Which makes it 20-6=14. So now, we got Sabrina had [14+10]+2=28 cookies left with her.", "answer": " 5"}

In a typical mating session, they will mate with several females to increase chances of pregnancy. The Pandas, while in captivity, do not always take to their mates well, and sometimes, the mates end up fighting each other. Additionally, while in captivity and without any choice on the part of the panda, pandas tend to get fat, which in turn may prevent the female from becoming pregnant. \n\n### If all pairs mated, then 25% of them will have at least one baby.

Therefore, 65,520 meals are impossible and 8 meals are impossible. Thus, the dogs and pupps eat 0 pounds of food a day. Because the dogs eat 12 times more food than the puppies, they must be overfed 36 times. This is equivalent to overfeeding a thousand cats since in 29 = 512 meals.

The given options are \"work\", \"rest and rejuvenate\", \"trip\", \"home\", and \"other\".\n4. \"Work\" and \"home\" are both possible places to stay for the weekend, and the answer can be one of them. Let's exclude these options and move to others.\n5. \"R&R\" is another possible way to describe your upcoming activity, but it's often used for people who are taking a vacation to a more relaxing place. So this is excluded as well.\n6. What's left are \"trip\" and \"other\", with \"other\" being the more likely choice here, because it could describe the act of making plans for the weekend, shopping to stock up, packing for the trip, etc.\n7. Hence, the answer choice that best fits the scenario is E: other. This provides more flexibility to answer the question \"other\" because the options are somewhat diverse and could be interpreted in different ways.\n8.

{"text": "After two nights, there will be 125 people.\n\n### Rationales:\nIn a small and sleepy town with a population of 300, it's pretty safe to assume that everyone knows everyone else well. It's pretty safe to also assume that everyone knows they have a limited time frame to figure out what's going on in town. A good and pretty common analogy to use here is that of a small crime drama town where all everyone talks about is the latest murder.\n\nThe first night, the town experiences its first known murder and it's pretty hard to argue that the killer in question was not a vampire seeing as they're already being described as turning people into vampires on a nightly basis.\n\nThe next night, there are already 25 people that are confirmed vampires (since they turned others into vampires). That leaves 275 remaining people and that may not seem very impressive, but if you think about the population of the town, that leaves 4 vampires with one more to turn. If they were to turn someone, there are only 5 more remaining people they can turn.\n\nBarring any major changes in behavior (no one else turning), and some people moving from living areas without neighbors to living alone, you can conclude that it takes 5 people to turn 1 more person so you have 4 vampires who need to turn 1 person, and now 246 people who need to be turned by all those 5 vampires. And after the first night, that 246 would already have 25 people who already turned others. So essentially, 5 people have to wait for the remaining 246 people to be turned into vampires (for them to be turned so they can then turn). That means now all the vampires needs to turn is 246 people which is 54 people (246/4).\n\nAnd, since we're a sleepy town, you assume that no one lives by themselves so there are always 4 vampires left to deal with and everyone has to turn another 54 people into vampires to make 650 total and thus the answer.\n\nAnswer: 0", "answer": " 72"}

There are 8 loads of clothes that need to be wash, which are assumed to be loaded at the same time.\n2. Each load of laudry takes approximately 45 minutes to wash, so we know that there are 360 minutes total in the washing cycle.\n3.

{"text": "After Mary gives away half of her 26 blue shirt and a 1/3 of her 36 brown shirt, she would have a total of 16 blue shirts that's remaining, and 19 brown shirts that't remaining. Let's say we have a certain number of blue shirts in our starting inventory, 26 (B), and we have certain amount of brown shirts in our inventory, 36 (B). (In the problem Mary has a total of 26+36=62.\nWe can solve this problem by using an algebraic equation to find the remaining blue shirts and brown shirts. Let's start with the blue shirts first! We know that after giving away half of our blue shirts, we will be left with (26/2) = 13 blue shirts. Now, we can solve for B by using the equation 13B = 26 with a solution of B = (26/13) = 19. In this case, after giving half of our blue shirt total, we have given away 13 blue shirt which is 26 divided by half of 26, or 13 which is equivalent to (36/36)*13.\n\nNext, let's solve for the brown shirts! Once again, we would like to know how many brown shirts we now have after giving a third of our brown shirts (1/3)^13 + 26 = 19 brown shirt. To take care of this, we would need to solve for B with the equation B = 19 - (1/3)^9 (B). For an unknown variable, we multiply both sides of an equation by the variable (this is how we solve for B): \n((1/3)^9 + 1)B = 19 - ((1/3)^9+1). This will get us this equation: ((((((3)/13)^9)*1) + 1)B\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we are getting: B = 19-(3/(13)^9). Our step here is actually a combination of multiplying and simplifying the multiplication of the same numbers multiple times ((((((3)", "answer": " 37"}
{"text": "There are 34 floors in the building.\n\n### Rationale:The first thing to note is that there are two floors between the top floor and the 9th floor where the elevator begins its descent. Hence, there are 32 floors below the top floor.\n\nNow that we have established the number of floors below the top, we can find the number of floors in the building by subtracting it from the total.\n\nHence, there are 34 flooors in the building.\t\t\t\n\n### Inputs: How many pieces of art can fit on a 26 ft wall?\n\n### Rationales: 1) The first number, 26, is a specific dimension of the wall.\n\n2) The second number, \"ft\", is a unit of measurement which implies that we are dealing with some kind of length.\n\n3) Now, the problem asks how many pieces of art can be put on a 26-ft wall. The number of art pieces on the wall could be a fraction or a number. Let us consider the more practical case of a number.\n\nThe dimension of the wall of 26 ft is 26 inches (or 26/12 ft or 2/1). The length of 1 ft could be considered a part of an art piece. Therefore, 26 ft would have a total of 26/1 (1 + 1/2) = 12/2 = 6 pieces of art.\n\n### Input[s]: How many pieces of art would fit on a given piece of paper?\t\n\n### Rural:The first number, 2, is the width of the paper, and the second number, \"ft\" indicates inches, so we are dealing with dimensions. If we assume the paper is A4 size, it will be 210mm*297mm and has a width of 210mm.\n\nNow that the dimensions are established, we can ask, how many pieces of art would be put on an A4 piece of paper?\n\n210mm would equal approximately 8.2675 inches, and 8 inches represents a significant fraction of the width of the paper. Therefore, we could estimate that 10 pieces of art would fit an A4 piece of art.", "answer": " 13"}

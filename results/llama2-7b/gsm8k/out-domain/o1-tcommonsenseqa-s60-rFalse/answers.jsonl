On the next 15 years the number of ships should increase and the number of people should be halved every 15 years. In the next period it would have eaten 2 ships which would be 100 people and half the previous time which would just short of to 50 people.

{"text": "Input: This problem needs to be analyzed first and then a simple equation can be used to solve the problem.\n\nFirst off you need to figure out the amount of time in days so you can divide that equation into a smaller amount of time.\nYou have four hours for the customer outreach post and your client makes you do a half of that for advertisement post a day so that is 2 hours at the most on the advertisement post.\nNow you take the total days for the week which in this case is 5 days you then divided the time spent for each day of the week.\n\n### Solution:\n\nTo solve we need to analyze the problem first. To answer this question I need to figure out the time in days. Now the problem states that Bryan works eight hours each day. So the total days for a week would be 5. Since this is not even one of those days I would have to divide the 5 from the 8 because I have two whole numbers and the equation is of the form 5x (where x is an unknown number which could be any number including a fraction).\n\nSo we get our 8 hours divided by 5 then we get our result of 1.6 hours per each of the days for the week. So we take a quarter of that and that is our 0.4 which is 0.4 hours per day on the advertisement side. But this is not including the lunch and breakfast which could possibly reduce the advertisement hours to less than our half the four hours at the maximum.\n\nSo we take all the time spent on what it is required of us and this is 2 hours that is 1.6+0.4 or maybe because break or lunch or dinner takes away from the the work. Then multiply that by four and we get 8.4 hours which we can put in a sentence stating that Bryan will spend 8.4 hours each on the customer outreach side each week.\n\n## Screenshot of completed instruction\n![Screen Record 2021-06-14 at 19 23 01](./scr.png)", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "Input:\nJose was a man who found something he was good at and stuck to it for the long term. He was a collector of fine wine, and he spent a lot of time and money building up a collection that he was proud of. Jose decided to throw a party for his collector friends, and he had a lot of fun.\n\nOutput:\nAt Jose's party, 2400/3*(0.3**7)+(0.5**7) of Jose's wine bottles were consumed. At the time of the party Jose had 4000 bottles. After the party, 3/8 of all the wine (2400/8) would still be at the party.\n\nDemonstration with pictures\n\nFirst Jos\u00e9 sets out some bottles of imported wine. At this point we have 2400 imported bottles (0.5 * 2400)\n\nThen Jos\u00e9 brings out 1200 domestic bottles (0.2 * 240)\n\nFinally to show how he arrived at 3/8 Jose sets out some bottles with a ratio of 0.375. Each of these bottles represents 1/9. (0.375 * 24=300) We have 240 total bottles.\n\n![Alt Text](https://github.com/chris-shum/shumchristopher-learnpython/blob/master/pictures/week4_math/imports%20vs%20domestic.png?raw=true \"Picture 1\")\n\nNext he brings out the rest of the wine from the cellar, representing 0.5 * 4000 which equals 2000 bottles\n\nThen he brings out what's left of the imports, which are 3/8 of what's left of his collection 300/(8*4)=40\n\n![Alt Text2](https://github.combine/shumchristoper-learnpython/blobvmaster/pictures/math_week4_exercise.png?raw=ture \"Picture 2\")\n\nNow let's use our equation.\n\n*2400/1*(1/9)+(0.5/1)*(", "answer": " 2400"}

Nancy came back and filled it with three times more water.\n\n### Input\nNancy's mother had half of her cake made and she left it out for a few minutes, meanwhile, Nancy's sister stole her cake. Nancy made a cake that took half the time as her mothers would but her mothers cake was better and hers wasn't quite as good. Nancy made three trays of cake and her sister made three trays but there isn't enough cake left to fill one more tray what time did Nancy's sister stolen the cake.\n\n### Response\n\n> Nancy made a cake in 2/3 of the amount of time her mother's cake. However, it wasn't quite as tasty so she made 3 times as much so that she still had half of her amount of the cake left over. her cake was better than her mothers cake so it took a bit longer to make a cake that is half the time that her mother took. Therefore, her mother's cakes time for one tray was more than twice Nancy's mothers time when making a cake that is double the amount of a tray. Her sister could also have made a cake so she made three trays. So if her tray was 1/6 and her mothers tray was more than 2x that and her sister made three times as much as her that made her tray 1/12 which means that Nancy had enough cake for 3/6 times as much cake as her sister but her sister ate most of them.

This question will be answered easily as long as the student has good mathematics skills and the ability to use a calculator to simplify large equations. The answer can definitely be found but the mathmatical and number skills is what is needed to answer the question. The most difficult part of question is the fact that the student must use a higher mathmatical equation. The skill here is to simplify the equation to make it more manageable to complete.\n\n### Feedback:\nThe Feedback for this answer can range from a question looking more closely towards the steps of solving questions like this to the accuracy of the computation of the answer. Even then, feedback is easy to give and to receive. If the student takes the extra step to explain their reasoning to further the comprehension of the learning objectives for the day, this would create an amazingly great learning objective for the student at hand. The student should ask if anyone in the class needed more explaining about the concept before going on to the next question.\n\n## Scenario\n\n### Instructions\nWrite a response that appropriately shows all your work and makes a mathematical argument that shows all of your critical thinking, analysis, and reasoning processes:\n\n#### Demonstration\nInput: For example, here is a task that demonstrates demonstration for grade five.

{"text": "A: 46\n\n### Description: \n\n- The first time the student has to answer the question using integers and division operations. The second time a second hint gives the student how to answer the question using a combination of integer arithmetic, division and modulo. This is demonstrated with the car lot question in the previous example\n- Notice that, by giving the hints, a student that is unable to answer the question at all now has a strategy that is a step-by-step process to answer the question. This helps the student understand that a question like this can be simplified, but this isn't always true. If an answer is complicated or uses complicated notation, simplify if you can!\n\n### Input & Output Examples:\n\n#### First Response:\n\nThe second input asks for the number of tires on the used car lot in all.  The hint provides an explanation as to how to arrive at the  answer via a division.\n\n```java\nAns: 8\n\nFirst: 24*1/3=24/3\n\nSecond:     24/3=8  // 8 tires on the car lot total \n```\n\nThe first hints the students to answer the question using integer arithmetic division. A second hint gives a new method of how to complete the math problem.\n\n```java \nAns: motorcycles 8\n\nFirst : 8/3=2\n\nSecond: 2*3=6  // 6 motorcyles on the used car lot total\n```\n\n#### Second Response:\n\nAns:7\n\nFirst:  24*1/4=24/4=6\n\nSecond: 6*3=18\n\nThe teacher provides an answer that solves the math problem as written and it appears that it contains errors.

{"text": "Input: In order to achieve what? Choices: A: a 100% birth rate B: a low failure rate C: at least 2 offspring D: 96% birth rate \nAnswer: B: a low birth rate\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: A: At least 1 of all pairs should get pregnant, in order to achieve a 100%. A 25% success rate only guarantees 1 of every 4 pairs will have offspring. This would yield only 24 panda babies in a 16 panda zoo.\n\n### Input\nThe first task above does not have enough information, because it does not include all the factors that determine the panda birth rate:\n\nP: the percentage of pandas mating during a given day. If mating was allowed only every other day, this would mean only 50% of the pandas would mate in an average day.\nC: the total number of pandas in the zoo\nT: the percentage of pandas that survived to adulthood (100-50%, which is the percentage of pandas that are either mating or dead) (there are, of course, only so many pandas that survive birth and then go on to mate in the first place, so there are only a limited number of pandas to mate. Panda babies have a 95% chance of surviving to adulthood, which means that each year, 5% of panda babies will die)\n\n### Solution:\n\nBased on P, C and T,\n\nN=C/2 = 16/2 = 8\n\nN*(P/100*365) = (8*50/100*1)   = 8\n\n100*T\n\n=100*95\n\nTo find the total number of Pandas with offspring, you have to multiply P by T = 0.95.\n\nTo find how many offspring each panda produces, you must multiply the number of males and females mating that day by this to find the chance each panda has to mate successfully. To determine the chances for each pair getting pregnant, you still have to multiply, but it's only for 95% of P", "answer": " 2"}

This requires having the student explain his solution to the teacher. This would make the teacher able to explain where the student went wrong. It's important for the teacher to clarify whether the students are supposed to have a calculator, or have to do the problem without. (B) The students should try to show as far as they can go for themselves, so that they will learn better. \n\nAdapted from Bender/Boschee\n\n### Instructions:Explain the number of squares in the shaded area of this picture.\n\n### Solution:\nInput:The easiest way to solve this problem would be to look at the shaded are and start by using counting numbers until the square is full. The square is not full, so we can't count on a 3 x 3 square. There are 6 more numbers between 12 and 17 for the square to be full. This is 5 more than the shaded area (12-17 - 6 = 5) so there are 5 squares in the shaded are.\n\nThis could be an area question instead. 5(width) x 5(height) = __ __ square feet.\n\nAnswer: (F) I would say that if the student wrote an explanation for their answer that they get a full answer. I would say that if I am trying to correct the student, I would write down a number 12 or something simple where they would understand how I expect to be taught. I would also say the letter A is probably the best choice.

What is the concentration of baking soda in a recipe that calls for 4.5 cups of water, contains 2.5 cups of fish oil, and requires 4.5 tbsp of lemon juice?\n\n### Answer:\nOption(B) 9.7%\n\n###Justification:\n\nCalculations:\n\nThe ratio of water is 1:10\n\n10/3.5=2.857142857\n\nWe multiply the fish because fish oil is two times more concentrated than water. We then need to divide the fish oil and lemon juice values by the water value and we come up with 0.97\n\n### Bonus:\nThe bonus problem was answered in the last class.\n\n### Class Activity:\n1. Add the values under 2.86 to the number of units we have.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe dog was born at a very small weight that was 6 pounds which is 75% of its weight it doubled in size by week 9 and reaches the final 62 pound weight which is 32 ounces of water.\n\nIt is clear that the dog grows tremendously because it grows at a rate of 2.4 pounds each week for 7 weeks. 5 pounds in 7th weeks and then 9 pounds by the 3 weeks and then 16 by the next one and in total the dog doubles its weight by 4 times.\n\nThis shows that the dog was born at a small size and reached an adult weight by double its original weight and each time increased by a half", "answer": " 78"}

{"text": "![](screenshot.png)\n\n### Explanation:\nSame way you solve the perimeter problem, but instead of writing the values for `p'`, `q'`, `r'`, and `s'`, you write them for `p`, `q`, `r`, and `s`. If the question asked for your work, then you could do this too, but for this question it doesn't require that. After calculating the values of `p`, `q` `r`, and `k`, I simply divide `p` by `k` to get the percentage I multiplied `k` by to get the correct total values of `p`,`q`,`r`,and `1`. In the end I got 138.\n\n### Conclusion:\nI know that to write the code, you write the values in the variables `p', q', r', s' ` and multiply those values by `k` to find `p`, `q',` `r`, and 1`, but in this case it doesn't matter, because the teacher asks for the answer only.", "answer": " 9"}

If the student wants to solve a problem with an individual price, they would have input a question and answered it themselves.

To figure this out, we will need to write down all the prices as well as the total amount the person can spend. \n\n### Demostration:\nAs you can see, this question has no clear instructions besides writing and evaluating the work so that it will come with 25 students. In addition, the store is offering individual bags as well as packs (5). To get to the lowest amount, I took the amount of money the teacher has and made a table of every option. \n\n## Example Answer:\nWe can easily see that the teacher can spend the least amount of money if he buys only 3 packs of the vampire bags and 5 packs of the pumpkin bags. If he does both, he would have to pay $170 (25 x $65) and if he bought all of the bags he wanted, he would pay $195 ($170+$25). By looking through everything, we can say that if the teacher purchases a 5 pack of every choice, he will spend $65.

{"text": "Write an arithmetic equation with the correct operators that answers the question posed when you input all of the given data.\n\n### Input\nThe above scenario was just asked to a bunch of kids. No, I don't have their names.\n\n### Response\nJohn plays 20 games. In all of these games, he will make 70% of free throws. This breaks down in 70% of 20, which is 69 free throws. But there's more to the equation. For every foul he commits, he gets two free throws. For every game he plays, he commits one foul. So the total number of free throws is 69 games times 2 free throws for each foul. I have to divide both numbers in the equation by 5, which is the number of fouls he will commit in each game he plays, and get 13 which is rounded up. He will get 83 free throws per game.\n\n\n### Input John walks home.  He walks faster than Mary.  Mary walks faster than John.\nHow much farther does Mary live from John?\n\n### Demostration \nLet m stand for Mary and j stand for John.  For Mary to have \"M\" in the distance then John would have to have \"J\" in the distance. If m>j then Mary is farther away than John. But if m<j then John is farther away than Mary.\n\n### Answer\nJohn walks faster than Mary, so if John walks faster, then he lives farther, if Mary walks faster, then she lives farther. When Mary walks faster, j is lesser than m, but when j is lesser, when m walks faster, so they both walk faster and m isn't lesser than m.\n\n### Difficulty:\n\nIn the first problem no one was able to get it.

However, if the buyer tells him he is happy with a piece if the selling price is only slightly below the asking price. A group of potential buyers arrive. Each person in the group makes an offer, but Juan only accepts if the offer is equal to or below the asking price. Write a program that lets Juan decide between accepting each offer or rejecting it. For each offer, your program should calculate how much that offer is below the asking price and output a string like \u201crejected because it was $2.50 less than the asking price.\u201d (Rejected because it was 2.50 less the asking price) Here is an example, with the asking price in bold and the offer price in italics.\n\nYou:  How about $13?

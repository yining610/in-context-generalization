Since it is a university website, you can guess that the people are mostly college students, so they've come to seek some help with math. For example, maybe they are taking a math class and are stuck on a homework problem. The Math Tutor doesn't keep track of which problems they are on, though, so he doesn't know how many students are seeking help for homework problems and how many seek help for quiz preparation. We can deduce who's seeking help by looking at which times of the day each student visits. For each of the past 30 days, he could take his sample and do:\n(A) an exact fraction of the visits that are on school days (if no students visit after school hours on a weekday, multiply 100% by the school day fraction) \n(B) the fraction of visits that occurred on school days (after school hours during summer and days when school is not in session)\n(C) the fraction of visists that occur after school hours\nOutput:B:\n\nInput:The table below shows the height in inches that kids in Mr. Math's 4th grade class are at school on Monday, Thursday, and Friday.

How much does each piece cost?\n\nNote: Here, there should be some extra information to help complete the solution.  Here, the teacher will not accept a number and will only accept a formula so that the students can find the answer and work in their notebooks.  That is:  A: 2(70c) = 70c  B: 2(90c) = 90c  C:  3(70c) + 3(90c) + (green) = 70(3c)  D:  3(75c) + 3 + (striped) = 75(3c)  E:  6(70c)  or  (3c*3c*3c)\n\nAnswer: A.

If theta is the angle from this point on, how many quadrants will the circle cover? \nOutput: A: Three B: Four C: One D: Two E: Zero Explanation:  Circle in geometry is explained in the following. The circle is defined by its center and radius and has an angle theta, that is the angle between the x-axis and the line joining the center and that value of theta.  The angles can be classified as either exterior or interior angles with respect to the x-axis.\n\nExample Exterior Angles:  If we start with angle 0 then we get angles \u2212180, \u221290 and 90 in clockwise orientation.  If we start with a positive number and then add 360 degrees, then we also get a positive answer. Exterior angles are the angles not in the interior of the circle.\n\nInterior Angles: The interior angle has a different boundary and there are 360 degrees divided by 2, 180 degrees. With that being said, the angles inside the circle are always acute angles.\nIf we draw a radius on the outside then we will get 90, 60, and 30 degrees that represents the interior angles of the circle. \n\nThis problem asked how many quadrants the circle will cover. The circle is on the origin or an infinite circle and since it is a four quadrant problem it will cover four quadrants or a complete circle. It does not cover all quadrants and therefore 4", "answer": " 108"}

This is an example of breaking down information.\n### Solution: The teacher didn'thave time to see what they did wrong, but he/she wanted to show them how to calculate without providing any calculations, only the answer.\n\n## Solution:\n\n## Input:\nThere are 8 loads (groups) of laundry that are waiting. They each take 45 minutes to wash and dry. The first two take one hour and 30 minutes, then two more loads take two hours each, so four loads take two hours, then two loads take 1 hour. 8 loads is one hour less than four (4) because four loads take two hours while two loads take 1. So to wash the eight loads take two hour, forty-five minutes to wash.\nThe dryer is a bit trickier. Each time we make a load, we take one hour to wash and dry that load. So if we make eight loads, it takes six hours total. Each load of clothes takes one hour. So if we have eight loads, we make eight loads in our first hour and half of another load in our second hour to dry the clothes. To break it down a bit further, eight loads take an hour to wash and an hour to dry, and then each half hour takes another load to dry.  So it will take 8 hours to wash and 4 hours to dry.", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "42\n\n#### Explanation/Justification:\nI was asked a couple of math questions in grade school. \nI thought it would be fun to go through and answer all of them from my grades 2-6 classes. These questions are from all over the Internet including StackOverflow and the text book \"Mathematics, grade 6 Student's Book\" and my grade school curriculum text book \"Mathematical Studies\". I had to come up with a way to grade these questions with automating some of the process. To create an automated way of grading I broke the questions up into various forms. Once the question type was known I would select a correct answer and create a list. The correct answer list would be appended to a question. The final question/answer set would be saved in a file with a JSON header. There were some problems that occurred that I had to come up to a way of grading. The most difficult question type was those that had many answers and no way of knowing which one was correct/wrong. I decided to go through the question set and come up with what I thought was the correct answer, but without using up too much computing resources this was difficult. I had to create some heuristics to determine which answer would be the one to use. I would then take each of the answers and give the question a grade. I would pick the minimum grade. Then I would get the correct answer's grade. Then I would take the minimum of the one that scored well and the answer I picked. With these two numbers I had the grades which led me to know the grade of the question. This grading formula was used for all questions except for the 20 questions that required work. These 20 questions were graded based on two separate things, first if the answer was correct or not then a grade and then an evaluation of the work put in for the question.\n\n#### Reproducing Process\nI used the Windows Command Prompt in this operation. The folder the code is stored in had been added to the Environment variables PATH. I then used the following commands: \n\n    >git clone https://github.com/JJJVanDenHove/my-coding-challenges.git\n    >cd my-coding-challenge-git\n    >node scripts/052_mathematics/grading/GradeMath.js my", "answer": " 0"}

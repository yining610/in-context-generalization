{"text": "C: 82\nInput: There's the 0% sales tax on many things such as foodstuffs. Sales taxes will make food significantly more expensive, and may lead to a dietary change. In some parts of the world, food has become unaffordable, or difficult to buy due to the increased price of transportation. For instance, a survey carried out in Pakistan for a UNDP report, shows that most people cannot afford fresh meat, fish or eggs because the cost of buying these has increased by 75-95%. It is cheaper to buy carcass animals and use them for food processing. Food processing is done using the most affordable of all sources of energy, namely the biomass (for example cow dung). This leads to more consumption as well as the production of biogas that can be sold or used in the house to cook food. The poor consume a lot of calories and are still underweight due to a small portion size. To combat this, the government of Pakistan recommends a plate of rice or wheat with a few green vegetables such as mangoes, khark or potatoes, green pea, carrots and pudding.\nOutput: A: underweight\nInput:The last train leaves at 2:30am.

In order to evaluate whether a computer could grade multiple choice grade math exercise question in high school, the following grade math exercise questions have been chosen. They cover a breadth of question types which are common in high school math. These questions were created with the intention of evaluating multiple-choice questioning. It is not the intention to evaluate any particular computer grading methodology, but rather to compare the output of one computer grading program with grading by three human instructors. It is expected that all three humans would grade the same questions with complete agreement. It is not expected that any computer program could grade questions with complete agreement with all three humans. These questions will not be graded as a group of questions, but rather three grades will be assigned by each human. The computer grading program, while it may grade with complete agreement with the humans, is still considered an experiment, and will be graded by the humans, but will not be given a grade. Once all questions and answers are given, we will see if this computer can evaluate whether it has correctly answered the question or not. \n**Please type the correct answers only in Python.The programs should be commented clearly.**  \n```\n\nInput:What is 640 \u2013 125?\n\nOutput: C: 480\n\nInput:The sum of 68 and 27 is 95 or $95.\n\nOutput: C. $95\n\nInput: 3/4 =\n\nOutput: None 3 out of 4 have the same value.\n\nInput: What is 724 + 288?\n\nOutput: D. 1012\n\nInput: 724 - 288 =\n\nOutput:  C. 436\n\nInput: What 712 \u2013 424?\n\nOutput:  None 712-424 is not equal to 288.\n\nInput:  How much is 0.88 + 2.01?", "answer": " 4"}

In how many ways can you pack these snacks?\nOutput: D: There are 328 ways.\n\nInput: You can't pack 100 apples into a bin, how many boxes do you need to put into?\nOutput: D : 2\n\nAnswer: The solution is to find a number x such that you can divide the apples and the oranges into the same group of x.\n\nNow let's solve it by hands.\n\nTo understand how we do it, we can consider another example of x. If we have 5 oranges and 6 apples, there are six division possible, where each is 6 / 6 times an apple and the remainder in an orange. 6/ 6 is 1, so we get 1 apple, and we have 1 remaining orange. 7 + 1 = 8 apples, and 8 / 6 is 1 and 8 * 1 is 8.\n\n6 / 6 is 0, but the result is 1 orange, so we have 7 apples, 1 orange. 8 / 6 leaves 2 for the first orange, 9 / 6 = 1 for the second orange.\n\n7 / 6 apples is 1, and the answer is correct.\n\nNow consider the original example and you'll figure it out fast.\n\nSo how much is x? let's make the example x = 4. \n\nwe have 5 oranges, so we take 4 of them.  We have five of them left, and four of them is 4 / 4. We're left with one of the 4 apples, so take it. Now you have 5 apples left, and 4 of those are 4 / 5. So finally we have two oranges left and one apple, this is 1 / 3.\n\nThis is the number x.\n\nIf you divide 16 apples and 48 oranges, then first 16 apples are 16 / 48", "answer": " 22"}

At the end of the line, the coins are dropped one by one into a container.  The coins all have the same weight (of the same amount of the machine is inserted).\n\nThere will be some coin in the machine which weighed more and some weighed less than the other coins.  In the case of two coins being of the same weight, the one with the biggest head is heavier (in the case of two same coins, it would be like coin-flipping).\n\nThere is one final step in the process.  We remove the coin from the machine.\n\nIf the coin that was inserted is heavier than 2 coins that weighed less than it, then the coin is dropped in the container.  The coin is definitely dropped if it is heavier than the 2 coins that were before it.\n\nIf 2 coins are heavier than the one that was dropped, then the coin will be dropped.  Or if all coins before it weighed less, and the coin is heavier than the rest, then the coin will fall.\n\nHere is the way that the coins will move from start to end:\n\n* The 2 coins that are inserted are both dropped\n* The 2 that are dropped are dropped together (if there is only 2, then the bigger coin is always dropped)\n* The coin that is dropped gets added to the container\n* If there is 1 coin left, it is in the container already\n\nTherefore, the last coin gets dropped 111% of the time (100% when 4 coins or less are present, and 25% when all coins are dropped/added).\n\n###", "answer": " 9"}

I will reveal and explain the answer to the question. \n\n\n### Solution using the concept of exponent\n\nLet us begin by writing the number using the base '10' called the **decimal notation**. \n\n$$1000000 = 107)$$\n\nThese 7's in the above expression represent the place of the place values.\n\n$10000 = $ **thousand**\n $000 = $ thousand\n$00 = $ ten\n\nWe can write in a number using the exponent notation as follows where the exponent is the place value of each number. \n\n$$A(10000)^{1000} \\approx A10000$$\n\nHere A and 10000 are called the _base_ and _exponent_ **respectively**. \n\nThus $$1000 \\times 1000 \\ldots \\times 10  \\approx 10,000$$\nIn general, \n\n$$N^{n} \\approx N^x$$\n\n### Above solution is wrong\n\nSometimes, the problem of addition of numbers in the decimal point is not as simple as \nadding the power of ten \n$$A =  10^x,B = 10^y$$\n\n\nLet us say A = 1000 and B = 100\nNow $$AB = $$ \n\n**Addition of power:** $(1000)^{1/2} + (100)^{1/10}$$\nHowever, this is not exactly adding power.

We can then convert the fractions to decimal form. To get the answer in decimal form, we can subtract 1.  So $3.25, $3.50 = $0.43 The fare from the last passenger is also 0.43.  So, what is 0.25/5 in decimal form? 0.43/5 or 2/25\n###### Solution:\n\nThe taxi driver rounded the last two passengers to $3 and $3.50.  So the total amount is $7.50.  He is short $2.50 so he gets $5 from each of the next two fare.  So the answer to the fraction with 5 should be:\n\n2/25\n\nThe result must be 1 because the first three fares should total $1 more than the last fare which is $3.  The sum of the first three fares is: 2 + (3 x 1) + (3.5 x 4/10) = $7.4 So the answer to $6.43 is 1.", "answer": " 11"}

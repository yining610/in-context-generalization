{"text": "To answer this question, multiply the number of people in line times the number of cars in one roller coaster ride. Since there are 2 people in each car, the number of people in one roller coater ride will be the same amount of people in one rollers coater ride.\n\nThere are a total of 7 * 2 passengers in each rollers coaster ride.

Write like it is a sentence.\n\n### Response:(3 points)\n\nThe following is a 6 word sentence.\u00a0The third word (5) does not describe what would normally be expressed in a word. As you learned in class earlier, when division is involved, each number is placed over another number called the divisor. In this case, y2 is the number that was being divided and 7 is the divisor. Since the y2 was being divided by 7, each number that is over 7 needs to be in denominators. Y2 should be 4 and 5 should be 2. (5/7) would need a denominator of 14. For example, if you were to do the following, you would reach the same answer. 5/7 + 2 = \u00a0 (4 + 2)/7 = 6/7 \u00a0or \u00a06/7 + 2/7 = 4/7.\n\n### Input\n\nComplete the division problems and express your answers as fractions in simplest form.\n\n*408 \u00f7 15\n\n### Response\n\nYou will have to write out the problem. In simple math of 408 divided by 15, you would normally write the following. \u00a0 \u00a0 (408/15) \u00a0 \u00a0The answer (27).\u00a0\u00a0 The way I am doing this is you write your problem as numbers before the division sign and 15 after the division sign.

In addition, 3:1 is different than 4:1, but the answer remains valid.\n- \"Spends four times as many...\" and 3:1 would also make a difference, as would 3:4, but the answer remains.\n- The overall ratio 4:9 is \"more\" than \"twice as much as\" a ratio of 2:9, as shown by the calculation 1:3.\n- The overall weekly ratio can be calculated using the ratio of 1:3 = 1:3 * 1:3 = (1/3)2 and the given fact that 2/3 of the workday weekend are spent working and the rest are spent catching up, and 2/3 is multiplied by (1/3)3 and the same is done to the remainder to get the total working weekly hours.\n- The monthly answer assumes the ratio held true throughout the entire month.\n- It is unclear when the Facebook time starts. If it is the whole weekend, then 5/12 hours would be the result.\n- Facebook could be replaced entirely by either working or socializing, thus affecting the ratio of weekend work to workday activities.\n- The ratio itself could be affected, so the math may change if 4:1 is changed to 2:8.\n- Jeff's daily activities could change, like working three hours some days instead of the four.\n\n### Credits:\nWizCode (12/10/", "answer": " 62"}

{"text": "20% heavier is the same as 1.2 times heavier. 1.2 times 30 is 36, so what we need to find is how heavy is 36, in pounds. 36 divided by 20 is 1, so 10/19 is 0.53 \n\n### Solution\n\nTo determine the heaviness of the weights, we multiply by 1.2 and then divide by 1.2 again. What we really care about is if there is a bigger difference between the weights that Tom is pulling up to when compared to the weights he has to pull down. The higher the number or the more the weights increase, the more significant the effect. We know that Tom has to lift 36 pounds to get to the top, and we know the weight feels heavier when he pulls it down. We can't just multiply 0.53 times 36 because those are two different units. We must multiply by 0.53 and then divide by 0.52 to get the number that feels twice as heavy when pulling up vs down.

Do you think that you can leave now and will make it to your destination?\n\n### Answer\nInput: I would get there two days sooner than my plane tickets suggest. So I'll go in my 2016 Toyota Avalon, the 272 hp vehicle that goes for around 33,ooo$. My Avalon has 20-inche alloy wheels and 6-spd automatic transmission. Traveling in an automatic car is better because you will never run out of gas because an automatic shuts down engine to conserve gas. You can use cruise control in an automatic car to avoid the need of constantly pushing the gas peddle. An automatic car also has a better response time when shifting gears allowing the driver to avoid accidental braking by going from 0-60 in 7.4 seconds. It's also 370 horse power which is enough power to get us from Los Angeles to San Francisco in a day and a half. Traveling with an automatic transmission is less wasteful of our resources because we don't burn so much gas and it will get better gas mileage. My Toyota Avalon has a 6.1 liter engine which is about half the size of the 3.5 liter engine in your car that gets about 19 mpg city and 23 mpg highway. Weather will never keep me from going because Toyota Avalons come in 4 trims or editions: XSE, XLE, Premium and Touring so you can find a model for any need or budget.

Each dog is assigned a friend according to the order of a sequence as follows:\n\n*\t1st Dog: Alice: married to Bob\n*\t2nd Dog: Brian: married to Carol\n*\t3rd Dog: Charles: married to Emily\n*\t4th Dog: Derek: married to Francis\n\nNow you want to go on a picnic and need to ask each of the friends to bring a dog to the picnic. No dog owner is allowed to bring the same dog as his/her friend. That means if the owner of 1st Dog (Alice) goes to ask Bob to bring a dog to picnic, then Bob cannot bring 1st Dog because Alice already brought it.\n\nYou want to ask each of your friend to bring a different dog (excluding the dog you brought) that he or she is closest to (based on your relationship with its owner) so that only the best ones are brought.\n\n### Response\n\nThe sequence which contains a correct answer is the one which has 4 different dogs in that sequence.\n\n*\t1.

Each digit of the binary number is converted into the corresponding ASCII code from 0-15 (0-9).\n\n0100 = 4 = 0+4+0+0\n\n44 = 5 = 4+4+0+5\n\n7 = 2 = 2+4+6+3\n\n1029 = 152 = 44+44+3+5\n\nReversible string can be thought of as an ASCII string. The string has 01, 10, 00, 11.\n\nExample:\n\nConvert 11110111100 (decimal) to reversible:\n\n```\nRe= 1111 (dec), rev: 0000 (dec),\n10111 = 1101010011 (dec),\n(10)11 = 0111010 (dec),\n0001 =0100 (dec), 001 =0001 (dec)\n11110 = 1100011 (hexadecimal),\n00 = 0000001111 (binary)    \n```\nNote that the order of decimal digits is not important because we perform a mod 2 operation.  \n\nThe reversible representation is just the way we write numbers in the decimal form. \n\n## 2's Complement String Representation\n\nThe 2's complement algorithm can work with any number.\n\nAn integer is said to be 2", "answer": " 5"}

If corn takes 1gallon of water per acre, his corn would only be 1000gallons of acre and that is the percentage of the total water going to Farmer Bob'sin farm.\n\n\n### Problem Set:Four children on a soccer team each received the same score after a soccer game. There were 8 kids on the team so each child got the average. If one child scored 3 fewer than the other three children, by how much did the average of the 8th-9th child differ from the average of the first 6 children?\n* Example: If the first 6 kids scored 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 then the 8th and 9th would both have scores of 35, but this is not true for the 8th child, the 8th child got a 13 out of which would mean the average of the remaining 6 kids would get 94/6=15.75.
